TI  == shifts in microbiota species and fermentation products in a dietary model enriched in fat and sucrose.
AB  == the gastrointestinal tract harbours a 'superorganism' called the gut microbiota,  which is known to play a crucial role in the onset and development of diverse diseases. this internal ecosystem, far from being a static environment, can be manipulated by diet and dietary components. feeding animals with high-fat sucrose (hfs) diets entails diet-induced obesity, a model which is usually used in research to mimic the obese phenotype of western societies. the aim of the present study was to identify gut microbiota dysbiosis and associated metabolic changes produced in male wistar rats fed a hfs diet for 6 weeks and compare it with the basal microbial composition. for this purpose, dna extracted from faeces at baseline and after treatment was analysed by amplification of the v4-v6 region of the 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) gene using 454 pyrosequencing. short-chain fatty  acids, i.e. acetate, propionate and butyrate, were also evaluated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. at the end of the treatment, gut microbiota composition significantly differed at phylum level (firmicutes, bacteroidetes and proteobacteria) and class level (erisypelotrichi, deltaproteobacteria, bacteroidia and bacilli). interestingly, the class clostridia showed a significant decrease after hfs diet treatment, which correlated with visceral adipose tissue, and is likely mediated by dietary carbohydrates. of particular interest, clostridium cluster xiva species were significantly reduced and changes were identified in the relative abundance of other specific bacterial species (mitsuokella jalaludinii, eubacterium ventriosum, clostridium sp. fcb90-3, prevotella nanceiensis, clostridium fusiformis, clostridium sp. bnl1100 and eubacterium cylindroides) that, in some cases, showed opposite trends to their relative families. these results highlight the relevance of characterising gut microbial population differences at species level and contribute to understand the plausible link between diet and specific gut bacterial species that are able  to influence the inflammatory status, intestinal barrier function and obesity development.

TI  == quantification of different eubacterium spp. in human fecal samples with species-specific 16s rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes.
AB  == species-specific 16s rrna-targeted, cy3 (indocarbocyanine)-labeled oligonucleotide probes were designed and validated to quantify different eubacterium species in human fecal samples. probes were directed at eubacterium barkeri, e. biforme, e. contortum, e. cylindroides (two probes), e. dolichum, e.  hadrum, e. lentum, e. limosum, e. moniliforme, and e. ventriosum. the specificity of the probes was tested with the type strains and a range of common intestinal bacteria. with one exception, none of the probes showed cross-hybridization under stringent conditions. the species-specific probes were applied to fecal samples obtained from 12 healthy volunteers. e. biforme, e. cylindroides, e. hadrum, e. lentum, and e. ventriosum could be determined. all other eubacterium species for  which probes had been designed were under the detection limit of 10(7) cells g (dry weight) of feces(-1). the cell counts obtained are essentially in accordance with the literature data, which are based on colony counts. this shows that whole-cell in situ hybridization with species-specific probes is a valuable tool  for the enumeration of eubacterium species in feces.
