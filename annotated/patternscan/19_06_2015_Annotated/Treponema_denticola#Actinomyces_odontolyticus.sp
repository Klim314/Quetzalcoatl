TI  == the effects of different orthodontic appliances upon microbial communities.
AB  == objectives: orthodontic appliances can promote accumulation of dental plaque, with associated enamel decalcification or gingival inflammation. the aim of this  study was to examine longer-term microbiological changes during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. materials and methods: twenty-four orthodontic patients aged 11-14 years undergoing fixed appliance therapy were recruited into  the study. each was randomized for cross-mouth assignment of molar bands and bonded molar tubes to contralateral quadrants of the mouth. all patients received self-ligating brackets, but again using randomization, one upper lateral incisor  bracket (left or right) also received an elastomeric ligature. plaque samples from the molars and upper lateral incisors were obtained at intervals during treatment and up to 1 year after appliance removal. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16s rdna microarray were used to compare plaque microbial fingerprints. results: plaque populations changed within 3 months of commencing treatment at all sites. the greatest differences in plaque composition were seen  with self-ligating brackets with an elastomeric ligature. post-treatment plaque associated with both types of molar attachment contained increased levels of periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and eubacterium nodatum, while campylobacter rectus, parvimonas micra, and actinomyces odontolyticus were also elevated with bonds. conclusions: the results suggest that orthodontic treatment may cause sustained changes in plaque microbiotas and that molar bond-associated plaque may have raised disease potential.

TI  == the association between detectable plasmatic human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) viral load and different subgingival microorganisms in brazilian adults with hiv: a multilevel analysis.
AB  == background: this study investigates the association between detectable plasmatic  human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) viral load (hvl) and high levels of periodontal- and non-periodontal-related microorganisms in the subgingival microbiota of individuals with hiv. methods: thirty-seven individuals with hiv were divided into two groups: 1) detectable hvl (n = 15); and 2) undetectable hvl (n = 22). subgingival biofilm samples were obtained, and the levels of 35 microbial species were determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. periodontal clinical measures and laboratory and sociodemographic data were also registered. chi(2) test, fisher exact test, and mann-whitney u test were used to compare groups. multilevel ordinal regression models were used to test the association between hvl and the levels of 35 microbial species in subgingival biofilm, adjusted for confounders. results: of the 35 species studied, 11 (31.4%) showed higher mean levels in the detectable hvl group than undetectable hvl group (p <0.001). these species included actinomyces naeslundii  ii, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, veillonella parvula, capnocytophaga gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter concisus, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and candida  albicans. significant associations between detectable hvl and high levels of microorganisms, adjusted for confounders, were observed for a. naeslundii i, actinomyces gerencseriae, c. gingivalis, e. corrodens, c. concisus, prevotella nigrescens, t. forsythia, and dialister pneumosintes. conclusion: detectable plasmatic hvl in individuals with hiv was associated with elevated levels of known periodontal pathogens, such as p. nigrescens, t. forsythia, and e. corrodens, as well as c. concisus, c. gingivalis, and d. pneumosintes in the subgingival biofilm.

TI  == antimicrobial therapy using a local drug delivery system (arestin) in the treatment of peri-implantitis. i: microbiological outcomes.
AB  == objectives: to assess the microbiological outcome of local administration of minocycline hydrochloride microspheres 1 mg (arestin) in cases with peri-implantitis and with a follow-up period of 12 months. material and methods:  after debridement, and local administration of chlorhexidine gel, peri-implantitis cases were treated with local administration of minocycline microspheres (arestin). the dna-dna checkerboard hybridization method was used to detect bacterial presence during the first 360 days of therapy. results: at day 10, lower bacterial loads for 6/40 individual bacteria including actinomyces gerensceriae (p<0.1), actinomyces israelii (p<0.01), actinomyces naeslundi type 1 (p<0.01) and type 2 (p<0.03), actinomyces odontolyticus (p<0.01), porphyromonas gingivalis (p<0.01) and treponema socranskii (p<0.01) were found. at day 360 only the levels of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were lower than at baseline (mean difference: 1x10(5); se difference: 0.34x10(5), 95% ci: 0.2x10(5) to 1.2x10(5); p<0.03). six implants were lost between days 90 and 270. the microbiota was successfully controlled in 48%, and with definitive failures (implant loss and major increase in bacterial levels) in 32% of subjects. conclusions: at study endpoint, the impact of arestin on a. actinomycetemcomitans was greater than the impact on other pathogens. up to day 180 reductions in levels of tannerella forsythia, p. gingivalis, and treponema denticola were also  found. failures in treatment could not be associated with the presence of specific pathogens or by the total bacterial load at baseline. statistical power  analysis suggested that a case control study would require approximately 200 subjects.

TI  == microarrays complement culture methods for identification of bacteria in endodontic infections.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the microbial composition of necrotic root canals using culture methods and microarray technology. twenty uniradicular  teeth with radiographic evidence of periapical bone loss and with no previous endodontic treatment were selected for this study. for molecular diagnosis a dna  chip with 20 different species-specific, 16s-rdna-directed catcher probes was used. the microorganisms most frequently detected by the dna chip were: micromonas micros, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp., tannerella forsythia, treponema  denticola, veillonella parvula, eubacterium nodatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces odontolyticus, and streptococcus constellatus. as expected, additional important bacterial taxa were found by culture analysis, but microorganisms such as t. forsythia and t. denticola could not be identified. in  conclusion, microarrays may provide significant additional information regarding  the endodontic microbiota by detecting bacterial species that are otherwise difficult or impossible to culture.

TI  == the effect of scaling and root planing on the clinical and microbiological parameters of periodontal diseases: 12-month results.
AB  == background/aims: previously, we reported that srp resulted in a decrease in mean  pocket depth and attachment level and reduced prevalence and levels of bacteroidesforsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola at 3 and  6 months post-srp in 57 subjects with adult periodontitis. 32 of the 57 subjects  were monitored at 9 and 12 months. thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the microbial and clinical effects of srp in 32 (mean age 48+/-11) subjects over a 12-month period. method: clinical assessments of plaque, gingival redness, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth and attachment level were made prior to srp and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-therapy. subgingival plaque samples were taken at each visit and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique for the presence and levels of 40 subgingival species. each subject also received maintenance scaling at each of the subsequent monitoring visits. differences in clinical parameters and prevalence and levels of bacterial species were analyzed pre- and post-therapy using the wilcoxon signed ranks test. the quade test for related samples was used for analysis of multiple visits. results: mean pocket depth (mm+/-sem) decreased  from 3.2+/-0.3 at baseline to 2.9+/-0.3 at 12 months (p<0.01). mean attachment level showed significant reduction at 6 months, but did not diminish further. bleeding on probing and plaque were significantly reduced at 12 months (p<0.001,  p<0.05, respectively). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and t. denticola decreased in  prevalence and levels up to the 6-month visit and remained at these lower levels  at 9 and 12 months. significant increases in levels and prevalence were noted at  12 months for actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum ss polymorphum, streptococcus mitis, capnocytophaga sp, and veillonella parvula. conclusions: the data suggest that the maintenance phase of therapy may be essential in consolidating clinical and microbiological improvements achieved as a result of initial therapy.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == keratinolytic activity of cutaneous and oral bacteria.
AB  == a test was developed to measure the keratinolytic activity of cutaneous and oral  bacteria. keratin, labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate, was used in a phosphate buffer (ph 7.2) with 1 mm dithiothreitol. the degradation of keratin was estimated by measuring the fluorescence of the degradation products in the supernatant of the reaction mixtures in a luminescence spectrometer. several oral and cutaneous bacteria were investigated: bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, treponema denticola, actinomyces odontolyticus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus hominis, staphylococcus  saprophyticus, brevibacterium epidermidis, brevibacterium lines, corynebacterium  glutamicum, corynebacterium minutissimum, corynebacterium ovis, and rhodococcus equi. the dermatophyte trichophyton rubrum was used as a control organism. the test offered a simple and quantitative method for the estimation of keratin degradation and enabled us to show keratinolytic activity in trichophyton rubrum, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, b. linens, b. epidermidis, bacteroides gingivalis, and treponema denticola. the keratinolytic activity was cell bound and heat sensitive. the presence of dithiothreitol stimulated the degradation of  keratin to mainly high-molecular-weight products.
