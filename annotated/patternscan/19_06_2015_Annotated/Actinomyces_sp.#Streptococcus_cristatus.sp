TI  == cultivable anaerobic microbiota of severe early childhood caries.
AB  == severe early childhood caries (ecc), while strongly associated with streptococcus mutans using selective detection (culture, pcr), has also been associated with a  widely diverse microbiota using molecular cloning approaches. the aim of this study was to evaluate the microbiota of severe ecc using anaerobic culture. the microbial composition of dental plaque from 42 severe ecc children was compared with that of 40 caries-free children. bacterial samples were cultured anaerobically on blood and acid (ph 5) agars. isolates were purified, and partial sequences for the 16s rrna gene were obtained from 5,608 isolates. sequence-based analysis of the 16s rrna isolate libraries from blood and acid agars of severe ecc and caries-free children had >90% population coverage, with greater diversity occurring in the blood isolate library. isolate sequences were compared with taxon sequences in the human oral microbiome database (homd), and 198 homd taxa were identified, including 45 previously uncultivated taxa, 29 extended homd taxa, and 45 potential novel groups. the major species associated with severe ecc included streptococcus mutans, scardovia wiggsiae, veillonella parvula, streptococcus cristatus, and actinomyces gerensceriae. s. wiggsiae was significantly associated with severe ecc children in the presence and absence of  s. mutans detection. we conclude that anaerobic culture detected as wide a diversity of species in ecc as that observed using cloning approaches. culture coupled with 16s rrna identification identified over 74 isolates for human oral taxa without previously cultivated representatives. the major caries-associated species were s. mutans and s. wiggsiae, the latter of which is a candidate as a newly recognized caries pathogen.

TI  == bacterial profiles of root caries in elderly patients.
AB  == culture-based studies have shown that streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli are associated with root caries (rc). the purpose of the present study was to assess  the bacterial diversity of rc in elderly patients by use of culture-independent molecular techniques and to determine the associations of specific bacterial species or bacterial communities with healthy and carious roots. plaque was collected from root surfaces of 10 control subjects with no rc and from 11 subjects with rc. the bacterial 16s rrna genes from extracted dna were pcr amplified, cloned, and sequenced to determine species identity. from a total of 3,544 clones, 245 predominant species or phylotypes were observed, representing eight bacterial phyla. the majority (54%) of the species detected have not yet been cultivated. species of selenomonas and veillonella were common in all samples. the healthy microbiota included fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, leptotrichia spp., selenomonas noxia, streptococcus cristatus, and kingella oralis. lactobacilli were absent, s. mutans was present in one, and actinomyces spp. were present in 50% of the controls. in contrast, the microbiota of the rc subjects was dominated by actinomyces spp., lactobacilli, s. mutans, enterococcus faecalis, selenomonas sp. clone cs002, atopobium and olsenella spp., prevotella multisaccharivorax, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and propionibacterium sp. strain fma5. the bacterial profiles of rc showed considerable subject-to-subject variation, indicating that the microbial communities are more complex than previously presumed. the data suggest that putative etiological agents of rc include not only s. mutans, lactobacilli, and actinomyces but also species of atopobium, olsenella, pseudoramibacter, propionibacterium, and selenomonas.

TI  == expression of the short fimbriae of porphyromonas gingivalis is regulated in oral bacterial consortia.
AB  == the mfa1 protein of porphyromonas gingivalis is the structural subunit of the short fimbriae and mediates coadhesion between p. gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii. we utilized a promoter-lacz reporter construct to examine the regulation of mfa1 expression in consortia with common oral plaque bacteria. promoter activity of mfa1 was inhibited by s. gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus mitis. in contrast, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus cristatus, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum did not affect mfa1 expression. expression of sspa/b, the streptococcal receptor for mfa1, was not required for regulation of mfa1 promoter activity. proteinaceous molecule(s) in oral streptococci may be responsible for regulation of mfa1 expression. porphyromonas gingivalis is capable of detecting heterologous organisms, and responds to selected organisms by specific gene regulation.

TI  == fusobacterium nucleatum transports noninvasive streptococcus cristatus into human epithelial cells.
AB  == analysis of human buccal epithelial cells frequently reveals an intracellular polymicrobial consortium of bacteria. although several oral bacteria have been demonstrated to invade cultured epithelial cells, several others appear unable to internalize. we hypothesized that normally noninvasive bacteria may gain entry into epithelial cells via adhesion to invasive bacteria. fusobacterium nucleatum  is capable of binding to and invading oral epithelial cells. by contrast, streptococcus cristatus binds weakly to host cells and is not internalized. f. nucleatum and s. cristatus coaggregate strongly via an arginine-sensitive interaction. coincubation of kb or tert-2 epithelial cells with equal numbers of  f. nucleatum and s. cristatus bacteria led to significantly increased numbers of  adherent and internalized streptococci. f. nucleatum also promoted invasion of kb cells by other oral streptococci and actinomyces naeslundii. dissection of fusobacterial or streptococcal adhesive interactions by using sugars, amino acids, or antibodies demonstrated that this phenomenon is due to direct attachment of s. cristatus to adherent and invading f. nucleatum. inhibition of f. nucleatum host cell attachment and invasion with galactose, or fusobacterial-streptococcal coaggregation by the arginine homologue l-canavanine, abrogated the increased s. cristatus adhesion to, and invasion of, host cells. in addition, polyclonal antibodies to f. nucleatum, which inhibited fusobacterial attachment to both kb cells and s. cristatus, significantly decreased invasion by both species. similar decreases were obtained when epithelial cells were pretreated with cytochalasin d, staurosporine, or cycloheximide. these studies indicate that f. nucleatum may facilitate the colonization of epithelial cells by bacteria unable to adhere or invade directly.
