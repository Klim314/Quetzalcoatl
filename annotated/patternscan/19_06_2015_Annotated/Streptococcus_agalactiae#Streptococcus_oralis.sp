TI  == transduction of the streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage phim46.1, carrying resistance genes mef(a) and tet(o), to other streptococcus species.
AB  == phim46.1 - streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage carrying mef(a) and tet(o), respectively, encoding resistance to macrolides (m phenotype) and tetracycline -  is widespread in s. pyogenes but has not been reported outside this species. phim46.1 is transferable in vitro among s. pyogenes isolates, but no information  is available about its transferability to other streptococcus species. we thus investigated phim46.1 for its ability to be transduced in vitro to recipients of  different streptococcus species. transductants were obtained from recipients of streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus suis. retransfer was always achieved, and from s. suis to s. pyogenes occurred at a much greater frequency than in the opposite direction. in transductants phim46.1  retained its functional properties, such as inducibility with mitomycin c, presence both as a prophage and as a free circular form, and transferability. the transductants shared the same phim46.1 chromosomal integration site as the donor, at the 3' end of a conserved rna uracil methyltransferase (rum) gene, which is an integration hotspot for a variety of genetic elements. no transfer occurred to recipients of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus salivarius, even though rum-like genes were also detected in the sequenced genomes of these species. a largely overlapping 18-bp critical sequence, where the site-specific recombination process presumably takes place, was identified in the rum genes of all recipients, including those of the species yielding no transductants. growth assays to evaluate the fitness cost of phim46.1 acquisition disclosed a negligible impact on s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. gordonii transductants and a noticeable fitness advantage in s. suis. the s. suis transductant also displayed marked overexpression of the autolysin-encoding gene  atl.

TI  == plasma components and platelet activation are essential for the antimicrobial properties of autologous platelet-rich plasma: an in vitro study.
AB  == autologous platelet concentrates are successfully adopted in a variety of medical fields to stimulate bone and soft tissue regeneration. the rationale for their use consists in the delivery of a wide range of platelet-derived bioactive molecules that promotes wound healing. in addition, antimicrobial properties of platelet concentrates have been pointed out. in this study, the effect of the platelet concentration, of the activation step and of the presence of plasmatic components on the antimicrobial activity of pure platelet-rich plasma was investigated against gram positive bacteria isolated from oral cavity. the antibacterial activity, evaluated as the minimum inhibitory concentration, was determined through the microdilution two-fold serial method. results seem to suggest that the antimicrobial activity of platelet-rich plasma against enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus oralis and staphylococcus aureus is sustained by a co-operation between plasma components and platelet-derived factors and that the activation of coagulation is a fundamental step. the findings of this study may have practical implications in the modality of application of platelet concentrates.

TI  == rapid detection of gram-positive organisms by use of the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the bact/alert pediatric fan system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  == assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. we evaluated the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp) in two pediatric hospitals. positive bact/alert pediatric fan blood cultures with gram-positive organisms were tested using the bc-gp in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. to test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles  were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 cfu  per milliliter. a total of 249 gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%,  respectively. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis  with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. the  bc-gp correctly identified 14/15 cases of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus  faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae. it misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with streptococcus anginosus group as s. pneumoniae. the bc-gp detected a case of streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus agalactiae. bc-gp's rapid accurate detection of staphylococcus spp., e. faecium, and e. faecalis and its ability to  ascertain meca, vana, and vanb status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining  to optimal antibiotic use. false-positive s. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the bc-gp.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of pure platelet-rich plasma against microorganisms isolated from oral cavity.
AB  == background: autologous platelet concentrates (pcs) have been extensively used in  a variety of medical fields to promote soft and hard tissue regeneration. the significance behind their use lies in the abundance of growth factors in platelets alpha-granules that promotes wound healing. in addition, antibacterial  properties of pcs against various bacteria have been recently pointed out. in this study, the antimicrobial effect of pure platelet-rich plasma (p-prp) was evaluated against oral cavity microorganisms such as enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus oralis and pseudomonas  aeruginosa. blood samples were obtained from 17 patients who underwent oral surgery procedures involving the use of p-prp. the antibacterial activity of p-prp, evaluated as the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), was determined through the microdilution twofold serial method. results: p-prp inhibited the growth of enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus oralis, but not of pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. conclusions: p-prp is a potentially useful substance in the fight against postoperative infections. this might represent a valuable property in adjunct to the enhancement of tissue regeneration.

TI  == evaluation antimicrobial and antiadhesive properties of the biosurfactant lunasan produced by candida sphaerica ucp 0995.
AB  == different groups of biosurfactants exhibit diverse properties and display a variety of physiological functions in producer microorganisms; these include enhancing the solubility of hydrophobic/water-insoluble compound, heave metal binding, bacterial pathogenesis, cell adhesion and aggregation, quorum sensing and biofilm formation. candida sphaerica was grown in a low cost medium, consisting of distilled water supplemented with 9% refinery residue of soybean oil and 9% corn steep liquor, for 144 h at 28 degrees c and 150 rpm. the cell-free supernatant obtained at the end of the experiments was submitted to extraction, and afterward the biosurfactant was isolated using methanol with a yield of 9 g l(-1). the critical micelle concentration of the biosurfactant was found to be 0.25 mg ml(-1) with a surface tension of 25 mn m(-1). several concentrations of the biosurfactant (0.625-10 mg ml(-1)) were used to evaluate its antimicrobial and antiadhesive activities against a variety of microorganisms. the biosurfactant showed antimicrobial activity against streptococcus oralis (68%), candida albicans (57%), and staphylococcus epidermidis(57.6%) for the highest concentration tested. furthermore, the biosurfactant at a concentration of 10 mg ml(-1) inhibited the adhesion between 80 and 92% of pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus sanguis12. inhibition of adhesion with percentages near 100% occurred for the higher concentrations of biosurfactant used. results gathered in this study point to a potential use of the biosurfactant in biomedical applications.

TI  == antimicrobial and anti-adhesive potential of a biosurfactant rufisan produced by  candida lipolytica ucp 0988.
AB  == in the last years, researches developed with biosurfactants for application in the medical area have been revealing the promising biological activities of these biomolecules. in this work the antimicrobial and anti-adhesive properties of a biosurfactant rufisan isolated from the yeast candida lipolytica ucp 0988, growth in a medium supplemented with ground nut refinery residue was determined against  several microorganisms. the biosurfactant was able to reduce the water surface tension from 70 to 25.3 mn/m and showed a critical micelle concentration (cmc) of 0.03%. the biosurfactant was isolated after 72 h of fermentation and was tested in concentrations varying from 0.75 to 12 mg/l. the highest antimicrobial activities were observed against streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus mutans,  streptococcus mutans ns, streptococcus mutans hg, streptococcus sanguis 12, streptococcus oralis j22 at a concentration superior to the biosurfactant critical micelle concentration. moreover, the biosurfactant showed anti-adhesive  activity against most of the microorganisms tested. as far as we know, this is the first compilation of data on antimicrobial and anti-adhesive activities of a  biosurfactant obtained from a candida strain against such a broad group of microorganisms. the results obtained in this work showed that the biosurfactant from c. lipolytica is a potential antimicrobial and/or anti-adhesive agent for several biomedical applications.

TI  == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) including streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf).
AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) in the sputum of adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf). freshly expectorated sputa (n=58) from 45 adult cf patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 190 isolates  of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these  isolates to belong to 12 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis,  s. cristatus, s. gordonii, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. pneumoniae, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis. the most frequently vgs organism isolated was s. salivarius (47/190; 24.7%), followed by s. mitis (36/190; 19%), s. sanguinis (25/190; 13.2%), s. oralis (20/190; 11.0%), s. pneumoniae (19/190; 10.0%), s. parasanguinis (16/190; 8.4%), s. infantis (11/190; 5.8%), s. gordonii (7/190; 3.7%), s. anginosus (4/190; 2.1%), s. cristatus (2/190; 1.1%), s. australis (1/190; 0.5%), s. mutans (1/190; 0.5%) and s. agalactiae (1/190; 0.5%). all, but four, patients harboured at least one vgs species, which ranged from one to five streptococcal species, with a mean of 2.85 species per patient. there was no clonality at the subspecies level employing eric rapd pcr. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) testing against penicillin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. overall, resistance to penicillin with all vgs was 73/190 (38.4%) and 167/190 (87.9%) for erythromycin. with regard to ciprofloxacin, 27/190 (14.2%) were fully resistant, whilst a further 21/190 (11.1%) showed intermediate resistance, which  equated to approximately three quarters (74.7%) of isolates being fully sensitive to this agent. in addition, as a comparator control population, we examined antibiotic susceptibility, as above, in a non-cf population comprising 12 individuals (50 vgs isolates), who were not receiving chronic antibiotics. in comparison, 8% and 38% of vgs isolates from non-cf individuals were resistant by  disk susceptibility testing to penicillin and erythromycin, respectively. none of the non-cf vgs organisms were resistant to ciprofloxacin, but 42% showed intermediate resistance.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of streptococci isolated from mastitic bovine milk samples in korea.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial resistance of streptococci isolated from mastitic bovine milk samples. a total of 178 isolates  belonging to 6 different streptococcus species were examined: s. uberis (n = 99), s. bovis (n = 30), s. oralis (n = 24), s. salivarius (n = 13), s. intermedius (n  = 7), and s. agalactiae (n = 5). only 8.9% (16/178) of the isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents tested in this study, and s. agalactiae and s. intermedius isolates were all resistant to at least 1 antimicrobial agent  tested. overall, the most frequently observed resistance was to tetracycline (61.2%), followed by lincomycin (43.2%), gentamycin (35.3%), oxacillin (34.3%), and erythromycin (28.6%). cephalothin and penicillin were the only antimicrobial  agents to which most of the streptococci (>or=92%) were susceptible. wide differences in the prevalence of resistance are apparent among the individual species: s. salivarius displayed exceptionally high resistance to cephalothin (23.0%) and oxacillin (76.9%) and s. agalactiae (20%) and s. intermedius (14.2%)  to penicillin. streptococcus salivarius and s. agalactiae were all susceptible to erythromycin, but others showed various rates of resistance ranging from 12.5% to 42.8%. resistance to 3 or more of 7 antimicrobial agents was observed in all species (37.6%, 67/178).

TI  == genetic relatedness of the streptococcus pneumoniae capsular biosynthetic loci.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) produces 1 of 91 capsular polysaccharides (cps) that define the serotype. the cps loci of 88 pneumococcal serotypes whose cps is synthesized by the wzy-dependent pathway were compared with each other and with additional streptococcal polysaccharide biosynthetic loci and were clustered according to the proportion of shared homology groups (hgs), weighted for the sequence similarities between the genes encoding the shared hgs. the cps loci of the 88 pneumococcal serotypes were distributed into eight major clusters and 21 subclusters. all serotypes within the same serogroup  fell into the same major cluster, but in six cases, serotypes within the same serogroup were in different subclusters and, conversely, nine subclusters included completely different serotypes. the closely related cps loci within a subcluster were compared to the known cps structures to relate gene content to structure. the streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis polysaccharide biosynthetic loci clustered within the pneumococcal cps loci and were in a subcluster that also included the cps locus of pneumococcal serotype 21, whereas  the streptococcus agalactiae cps loci formed a single cluster that was not closely related to any of the pneumococcal cps clusters.

TI  == rpob gene sequence-based identification of aerobic gram-positive cocci of the genera streptococcus, enterococcus, gemella, abiotrophia, and granulicatella.
AB  == we developed a new molecular tool based on rpob gene (encoding the beta subunit of rna polymerase) sequencing to identify streptococci. we first sequenced the complete rpob gene for streptococcus anginosus, s. equinus, and abiotrophia defectiva. sequences were aligned with these of s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. pneumoniae available in genbank. using an in-house analysis program (svarap),  we identified a 740-bp variable region surrounded by conserved, 20-bp zones and,  by using these conserved zones as pcr primer targets, we amplified and sequenced  this variable region in an additional 30 streptococcus, enterococcus, gemella, granulicatella, and abiotrophia species. this region exhibited 71.2 to 99.3% interspecies homology. we therefore applied our identification system by pcr amplification and sequencing to a collection of 102 streptococci and 60 bacterial isolates belonging to other genera. amplicons were obtained in streptococci and bacillus cereus, and sequencing allowed us to make a correct identification of streptococci. molecular signatures were determined for the discrimination of closely related species within the s. pneumoniae-s. oralis-s. mitis group and the s. agalactiae-s. difficile group. these signatures allowed us to design a s. pneumoniae-specific pcr and sequencing primer pair.

TI  == nationwide german multicenter study on the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in streptococcal blood isolates from neutropenic patients and comparative in vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin and eight other antimicrobials.
AB  == in a prospective multicenter study (1996 to 1999), 156 episodes of bacteremic streptococcal infections of neutropenic patients were evaluated. streptococcus oralis (26.3%), s. pneumoniae (26.3%), s. agalactiae (11.5%), s. mitis (9%), and  s. pyogenes (5.8%) were the predominant species. four strains (2.6%) were found to be intermediately resistant to penicillin. one strain (0.6%) was found to be highly resistant to penicillin (mic, 8 mg/liter). reduced susceptibility to penicillin was detected among s. oralis (14.6%), s. mitis (7.1%), and s. pneumoniae (4.9%) isolates but was not recorded among s. agalactiae and s. pyogenes. resistance rates and intermediate resistance rates for other antimicrobials were as follows (all species): amoxicillin, 1.3 and 3.2%; erythromycin, 16 and 2.6%; clindamycin, 5.8 and 0%; ciprofloxacin, 1.9 and 7.7%.  quinupristin-dalfopristin showed good in vitro activity against most streptococcal isolates (mic at which 50% of the isolates were inhibited [mic(50)], 0.5 mg/liter; mic(90), 1 mg/liter, mic range, 0.25 to 4 mg/liter).

TI  == identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.

TI  == intrageneric structure of streptococcus based on comparative analysis of small-subunit rrna sequences.
AB  == the partial 16s rrna sequences of 24 streptococcus species were determined by reverse transcription. a comparative analysis of these sequences and the sequences of seven previously studied streptococcal species revealed the presence of several clusters within the genus. the clusters obtained from the sequence analysis agreed in general with the groups outlined on the basis of the results of nucleic acid hybridization studies, but there were some exceptions. the pyogenic group was extended to include streptococcus agalactiae, s. parauberis, s. porcinus, and s. uberis. four oral groups were discerned; these four groups centered on s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. anginosus, and s. oralis. some species (e.g., s. suis and s. acidominimus) did not cluster with any particular group. our findings are discussed in the context of data from other genetic and chemotaxonomic studies.

TI  == microbiological flora in men with non-gonococcal urethritis with particular reference to anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == in a microbiological study of the urethral flora in men with non-gonococcal urethritis (ngu), chlamydia trachomatis (isolated from 30% of men) was the only organism isolated significantly more often from men with ngu than controls (p less than 0.01). bacteroids species, especially of the melaninogenicus-oralis group, were the predominant anaerobic bacterial isolate from both men with ngu (isolated from 24%) and controls (isolated from 30%). there was no evidence that  aerobic bacteria, anaerobic bacteria or herpes simplex virus made a significant contribution as primary pathogens in non-chlamydial ngu. gram-positive cocci were the only anaerobic organism isolated more often from chlamydia-positive men (29%) than chlamydia-negative men (16%) with ngu (p less than 0.01). the significance of this remains unclear.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of streptococcus.
AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. the major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (s. faecalis, s. faecium, 's. avium' and a proposed new species 's. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (s. bovis, s. equinus, s. salivarius, 's. casseliflavus', s. mutans, s. raffinolactis and an unidentified oral group i); (c) lactic species group (s. lactis including s. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (s. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (s. mitis, s. sanguis, a proposed new species 's. oralis' and 's. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. equi, 's. equisimilis' including 's. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of lancefield group b strains of human origin);  (g) parapyogenic species group (s. uberis, 's. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of lancefield groups r, s and t). species of aerococcus, gemella, leuconostoc and pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
