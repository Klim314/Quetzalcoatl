TI  == antimicrobial action of axol on periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial action of axol was tested against a panel of periodontopathic bacteria, which included treponema denticola, treponema vincentii, treponema sp., porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the axol commercial solution (undiluted) was effective in inhibiting some of the bacteria but not all. the rational for the use of antimicrobials is discussed.
