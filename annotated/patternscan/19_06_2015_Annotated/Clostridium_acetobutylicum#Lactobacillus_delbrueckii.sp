TI  == organization and nucleotide sequence of the glutamine synthetase (glna) gene from lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus.
AB  == a 3.3-kb bamhi fragment of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus dna was cloned and sequenced. it complements an escherichia coli glna deletion strain and hybridizes strongly to a dna containing the bacillus subtilis glna gene. dna sequence analysis of the l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus dna showed it to contain the glna gene encoding class i glutamine synthetase, as judged by extensive homology with other prokaryotic glna genes. the sequence suggests that  the enzyme encoded in this gene is not controlled by adenylylation. based on a comparison of glutamine synthetase sequences, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus is much closer to gram-positive eubacteria, especially clostridium acetobutylicum, than to gram-negative eubacteria and archaebacteria. the fragment contains another open reading frame encoding a protein of unknown function consisting of 306 amino acids (orf306), which is also present upstream of glna of bacillus cereus. in b. cereus, a repressor gene, glnr, is found between the open reading frame and glna. two proteins encoded by the l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus gene were identified by the maxicell method; the sizes of these proteins are consistent with those of the open reading frames of orf306 and glna. the lack of  a glnr gene in the l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus dna in this position may indicate a gene rearrangement or a different mechanism of glna gene expression.
