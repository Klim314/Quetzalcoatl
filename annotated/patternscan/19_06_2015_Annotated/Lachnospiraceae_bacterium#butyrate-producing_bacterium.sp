TI  == revealing the bacterial butyrate synthesis pathways by analyzing (meta)genomic data.
AB  == butyrate-producing bacteria have recently gained attention, since they are important for a healthy colon and when altered contribute to emerging diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and type ii diabetes. this guild is polyphyletic and cannot be accurately detected by 16s rrna gene sequencing. consequently, approaches targeting the terminal genes of the main butyrate-producing pathway have been developed. however, since additional pathways exist and alternative, newly recognized enzymes catalyzing the terminal reaction have been described, previous investigations are often incomplete. we undertook a broad analysis of butyrate-producing pathways and individual genes by screening 3,184 sequenced bacterial genomes from the integrated microbial genome database. genomes of 225 bacteria with a potential to produce butyrate were identified, including many previously unknown candidates. the majority of candidates belong to distinct families within the firmicutes, but members of nine other phyla, especially from  actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, spirochaetes, and thermotogae, were also identified as potential butyrate producers. the established gene catalogue (3,055 entries) was used to screen for butyrate synthesis pathways in 15 metagenomes derived from stool samples of healthy individuals provided by the hmp (human microbiome project) consortium. a high percentage of total genomes exhibited a butyrate-producing pathway (mean, 19.1%;  range, 3.2% to 39.4%), where the acetyl-coenzyme a (coa) pathway was the most prevalent (mean, 79.7% of all pathways), followed by the lysine pathway (mean, 11.2%). diversity analysis for the acetyl-coa pathway showed that the same few firmicute groups associated with several lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae were dominating in most individuals, whereas the other pathways were associated primarily with bacteroidetes. importance microbiome research has revealed new, important roles of our gut microbiota for maintaining health, but an understanding of effects of specific microbial functions on the host is in its infancy, partly because in-depth functional microbial analyses are rare and publicly available databases are often incomplete/misannotated. in this study, we focused on production of butyrate, the main energy source for colonocytes, which  plays a critical role in health and disease. we have provided a complete database of genes from major known butyrate-producing pathways, using in-depth genomic analysis of publicly available genomes, filling an important gap to accurately assess the butyrate-producing potential of complex microbial communities from "-omics"-derived data. furthermore, a reference data set containing the abundance and diversity of butyrate synthesis pathways from the healthy gut microbiota was  established through a metagenomics-based assessment. this study will help in understanding the role of butyrate producers in health and disease and may assist the development of treatments for functional dysbiosis.

TI  == human milk oligosaccharides shorten rotavirus-induced diarrhea and modulate piglet mucosal immunity and colonic microbiota.
AB  == the impact of human milk oligosaccharides (hmo) on mucosal immunity, gut microbiota and response to rotavirus (rv) infection was investigated in the piglet model. newborn piglets were fed with formula alone (ff) or formula supplemented with 4 g l(-1) hmo (hmo) or a prebiotic mixture of 9:1 short-chain galactooligosaccharides (3.6 g l(-1)) and long-chain fructooligosaccharides (0.4  g l(-1)) (pre) (n=19-21 per group) for 15 days. piglets (n=7-8) in each dietary group were orally infected with porcine rotavirus (rv) osu strain on d10, and stool consistency was assessed daily. blood, small intestine and colonic contents were collected at day 15. serum rv-specific antibody concentrations, intestinal histomorphology, rv non-structural protein-4 (nsp4) and cytokine mrna expression  were assessed. colonic content ph, dry matter (dm) and short-chain fatty acid concentrations were measured. ascending colonic microbiota was analyzed by 16s rrna gene v1-3 region pyrosequencing. hmo- and pre-fed groups had shorter duration of diarrhea than ff piglets. infection changed intestinal histomorphology, increased serum rv-specific antibody response and intestinal rv  nsp4 expression, and modulated ileal cytokine expression. hmo enhanced t helper type 1 (interferon-gamma) and anti-inflammatory (interleukin-10) cytokines in the ileum, while prebiotics promoted rv-specific immunoglobulin m response to the infection. rv infection and hmo supplementation altered intraluminal environment  and gut microbiota. hmo increased ph and lowered dm of colonic contents and enhanced the abundance of unclassified lachnospiraceae, which contains numerous butyrate-producing bacteria. in conclusion, hmo and prebiotics did not prevent the onset of rv infection but reduced the duration of rv-induced diarrhea in piglets, in part, by modulating colonic microbiota and immune response to rv infection.

TI  == prebiotic stimulation of human colonic butyrate-producing bacteria and bifidobacteria, in vitro.
AB  == dietary macronutrients affect the composition of the gut microbiota, and prebiotics are used to improve and maintain a healthy gut. the impact of prebiotics on dominant gut bacteria other than bifidobacteria, however, is under-researched. here, we report carbohydrate utilisation patterns for representative butyrate-producing anaerobes, belonging to the gram-positive firmicutes families lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae, by comparison with selected bacteroides and bifidobacterium species. growth assessments using anaerobic hungate tubes and a new rapid microtitre plate assay were generally in  good agreement. the bacteroides strains tested showed some growth on basal medium with no added carbohydrates, utilising peptides in the growth medium. the butyrate-producing strains exhibited different growth profiles on the substrates, which included starch, inulin, fructooligosaccharides (fos), galactooligosaccharides (gos) and xylooligosaccharides (xos). eleven were able to grow on short-chain fos, but this number decreased as the chain length of the fructan substrates increased. long-chain inulin was utilised by roseburia inulinivorans, but by none of the bifidobacterium species examined here. xos was  a more selective growth substrate than fos, with only six of the 11 firmicutes strains able to use xos for growth. these results illustrate the selectivity of different prebiotics and help to explain why some are butyrogenic.

TI  == intestinal dysbiosis and depletion of butyrogenic bacteria in clostridium difficile infection and nosocomial diarrhea.
AB  == clostridium difficile infection (cdi) causes nearly half a million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the united states each year. although the importance of the gut microbiota in c. difficile pathogenesis is well recognized, components of the human gut flora critical for colonization resistance are not known. culture-independent high-density roche 454 pyrosequencing was used to survey the  distal gut microbiota for 39 individuals with cdi, 36 subjects with c. difficile-negative nosocomial diarrhea (cdn), and 40 healthy control subjects. a  total of 526,071 partial 16s rrna sequence reads of the v1 to v3 regions were aligned with 16s databases, identifying 3,531 bacterial phylotypes from 115 fecal samples. genomic analysis revealed significant alterations of organism lineages in both the cdi and cdn groups, which were accompanied by marked decreases in microbial diversity and species richness driven primarily by a paucity of phylotypes within the firmicutes phylum. normally abundant gut commensal organisms, including the ruminococcaceae and lachnospiraceae families and butyrate-producing c2 to c4 anaerobic fermenters, were significantly depleted in  the cdi and cdn groups. these data demonstrate associations between the depletion of ruminococcaceae, lachnospiraceae, and butyrogenic bacteria in the gut microbiota and nosocomial diarrhea, including c. difficile infection. mechanistic studies focusing on the functional roles of these organisms in diarrheal diseases and resistance against c. difficile colonization are warranted.

TI  == anaerostipes hadrus comb. nov., a dominant species within the human colonic microbiota; reclassification of eubacterium hadrum moore et al. 1976.
AB  == recent molecular analyses suggest that bacteria related to strains ss2/1 and ssc/2, previously reported to be distantly related to anaerostipes caccae ncimb 13811(t), represent one of the ten most abundant phylotypes detected in adult human faecal samples. these two strains were isolated as d-lactate-utilizing bacteria from faecal samples of a healthy individual. we show here that they share >99.9% similarity in 16s rrna gene sequence with a new butyrate-producing isolate recovered from a colonic biopsy of a crohn's disease patient, and also with the sequence reported recently for eubacterium hadrum atcc 29173(t). biochemical profiling using api rapid id 32a and api zym test systems confirmed a close phenotypic similarity to e. hadrum atcc 29173(t), but also indicated that the description of this species should be expanded to include the ability to produce butyrate from d-lactate and acetate. phylogenetic analysis confirmed an affinity between e. hadrum and members of the genus anaerostipes (92.3-94.2% sequence similarity) belonging to the family lachnospiraceae (formerly clostridium cluster xiva). based on phylogenetic, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic evidence it is proposed that e. hadrum be transferred to the genus anaerostipes with the name anaerostipes hadrus comb. nov. the type strain of a. hadrus comb. nov. is =atcc 29173(t) (=dsm 3319(t) = vp 82-52(t)).

TI  == structural segregation of gut microbiota between colorectal cancer patients and healthy volunteers.
AB  == despite a long-suspected role in the development of human colorectal cancer (crc), the composition of gut microbiota in crc patients has not been adequately  described. in this study, fecal bacterial diversity in crc patients (n=46) and healthy volunteers (n=56) were profiled by 454 pyrosequencing of the v3 region of the 16s ribosomal rna gene. both principal component analysis and unifrac analysis showed structural segregation between the two populations. forty-eight operational taxonomic units (otus) were identified by redundancy analysis as key  variables significantly associated with the structural difference. one otu closely related to bacteroides fragilis was enriched in the gut microbiota of crc patients, whereas three otus related to bacteroides vulgatus and bacteroides uniformis were enriched in that of healthy volunteers. a total of 11 otus belonging to the genera enterococcus, escherichia/shigella, klebsiella, streptococcus and peptostreptococcus were significantly more abundant in the gut  microbiota of crc patients, and 5 otus belonging to the genus roseburia and other butyrate-producing bacteria of the family lachnospiraceae were less abundant. real-time quantitative pcr further validated the significant reduction of butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut microbiota of crc patients by measuring the copy numbers of butyryl-coenzyme a coa transferase genes (mann-whitney test,  p<0.01). reduction of butyrate producers and increase of opportunistic pathogens  may constitute a major structural imbalance of gut microbiota in crc patients.

TI  == effect of dietary protein level on growth performance, indicators of enteric health, and gastrointestinal microbial ecology of weaned pigs induced with postweaning colibacillosis.
AB  == the effect of dietary cp level on performance, enteric health, and gastrointestinal microbial ecology of weaned pigs challenged with enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) k88 was investigated in a 14-d study. forty weaned pigs (bw = 5.32 +/- 0.24 kg, mean +/- sd), housed 4 per pen, were randomly assigned to 2 diets (5 pens/diet): 1) 22.5% cp or 2) 17.6% cp supplemented with aa. diets contained the same amount of me and standardized ileal digestible lys, met + cys, thr, and trp based on the ideal protein ratio. isoleucine and val were added to the 17.6% cp diet up to the level in the 22.5% cp diet. on d 8 postweaning, pigs  were challenged with 6 ml of etec suspension (10(10) cfu/ml) by gavage. feed disappearance and bw were measured on d 7, 9, 10, 12, and 14 for determination of adg, adfi, and g:f. one pig from each pen was serially slaughtered on -1, 3, and  7 d postchallenge (10 pigs/d of slaughter) to evaluate gut morphology, and gut microbial ecology and metabolites. pigs fed the 22.5% cp diet had greater (p < 0.05) adg and g:f than those fed the 17.6% cp diet before infection, but performance was similar between the 2 diets after etec challenge and overall. on  d 3 after challenge, etec was not detected in the ileal digesta of pigs fed the 17.6% cp diet but was detected in the ileal digesta of 80% of pigs fed the 22.5%  cp diet (5.22 +/- 1.07 cfu/g, mean +/- sd). pigs fed the 17.6% cp diet had a greater (p < 0.01) prevalence of order clostridiales (73 vs. 50%), family lachnospiraceae (43 vs. 18%), and genus roseburia (13 vs. 3%) in the colon digesta 7 d after challenge compared with those fed the 22.5% cp diet. the richness and diversity of bacteria in the colon digesta were less (p < 0.05) in pigs fed the 17.6% cp diet than in those fed the 22.5% cp diet at -1, 3, and 7 d  postchallenge. pigs fed the 22.5% cp diet had greater (p < 0.05) ammonia n concentration in the colon digesta on -1 and 7 d after challenge compared with those fed the 17.6% cp diet. pigs fed the 22.5% cp diet had deeper (p < 0.05) crypts 1 d before challenge, shorter villi 3 d after challenge, and reduced villus height:crypt depth 1 d before and 3 d after challenge compared with those  fed the 17.6% cp diet. in conclusion, a reduction in the dietary cp level of weaned pigs from 22.5 to 17.6% with aa supplementation impaired growth performance before, but not after, the etec challenge and increased the relative  composition of butyrate producing bacteria in the colon digesta after etec challenge.
