TI  - Characterization of vaginal flora and bacterial vaginosis in women who have sex with women.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) may be common among women who report having sex with women (WSW) and frequently occurs in both members of monogamous couples. The results of Gram staining of a vaginal smear were consistent with BV in 81 (25%) and intermediate in 37 (11%) of 326 WSW included in this study. Lactobacilli were detected in 64% of subjects, and 42% of subjects had H(2)O(2)-producing strains. BV was associated with a higher lifetime number of female sex partners, failure to always clean an insertive sex toy before use, and oral-anal sex with female partners. Neither recent douching nor sexual practices with male partners were associated with BV. Vaginal smears from each partner were concordant in 55 (95%) of 58 monogamous couples; BV was present in both partners in 16 couples (28%) (P<.001, compared with expected distribution). BV was common among subjects who did not douche, who did not have concurrent sex with male partners, or who did not have a new sex partner, which suggests that other risk factors for BV exist. These data support the hypothesis that sexual exchange of vaginal secretions is a possible mechanism for acquisition of BV.
TI  - Second-trimester abortion caused by Capnocytophaga sputigena: case report.
AB  - Intra-amniotic infection is often the cause of a second-trimester abortion. The bacterial species involved include bacteria with low pathogenicity like Ureaplasma urealyticum and various Mycoplasma species. In this case we describe an intra-amniotic infection caused by Capnocytophaga sputigena, often found in the normal bacterial flora of the oral cavity, but not in the vagina. Oral sex during pregnancy was the most probable source of the infection. The aborted fetus showed signs of pneumonia upon histologic examination. The bacterial species was identified using broad-spectrum 16S rDNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) directly from the amniotic fluid and after bacterial culture. Amniotic fluid glucose was below detection level, confirming the presence of an intra-amniotic infection.
