TI  - Inactivation of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in red cell concentrates using INACTINE PEN110 chemistry.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The risk of transfusion-transmitted bacterial infections as a result of the presence of bacteria in blood is one of the major concerns in transfusion medicine. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether bacteria inoculated into red blood cell concentrates can be inactivated by the INACTINE PEN110 pathogen-reduction process. Four bacterial species were chosen for the study: anaerobic Gram-positive Clostridium perfringens and Propionibacterium acnes, known to be transfusion-transmitted; and two Gram-negative species, Acinetobacter johnsonii and Acinetobacter lwoffii, recently reported to be a common cause of transfusion-associated infections in Europe. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Identical units of leucoreduced red cell concentrates were inoculated with A. johnsonii, A. lwoffii, C. perfringens, or P. acnes. The 4 degrees C control units were put on storage immediately after receiving the spike. The test units were subjected to PEN110 treatment and then stored. The bacterial titre in all units was monitored during a 6-week storage period. RESULTS: The PEN110 inactivation of all tested bacterial strains was time- and titre-dependent. For A. johnsonii and A. lwoffii, no viable bacteria were detected in the units spiked with up to 10(4) colony-forming units (CFU)/ml and treated with PEN110. For red cell units spiked with 10(4)-10(5) CFU/ml of C. perfringens and P. acnes, no viable bacteria were detected in the units treated with PEN110. In control units, there was a gradual decrease in A. johnsonii, A. lwoffii and C. perfringens titres during cold storage, while P. acnes titres remained stable. CONCLUSIONS: The PEN110 pathogen-reduction process was demonstrated to inactivate high titres of A. johnsonii, A. lwoffii, C. perfringens and P. acnes in red cell concentrates.
TI  - Antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil and methanol extracts of Achillea millefolium subsp. millefolium Afan. (Asteraceae).
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of the essential oil and methanol extracts of Achillea millefolium subsp. millefolium Afan. (Asteraceae) were investigated. GC-MS analysis of the essential oil resulted in the identification of 36 compounds constituting 90.8% of the total oil. Eucalyptol, camphor, alpha-terpineol, beta-pinene, and borneol were the principal components comprising 60.7% of the oil. The oil strongly reduced the diphenylpicrylhydrazyl radical (IC(50)=1.56 micro g/ml) and exhibited hydroxyl radical scavenging effect in the Fe(3+)-EDTA-H(2)O(2) deoxyribose system (IC(50)=2.7 micro g/ml). It also inhibited the nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation of rat liver homogenate (IC(50)=13.5 micro g/ml). The polar phase of the extract showed antioxidant activity. The oil showed antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Acinetobacter lwoffii and Candida krusei while water-insoluble parts of the methanolic extracts exhibited slight or no activity. This study confirms that the essential oil of Achillea millefolium possesses antioxidant and antimicrobial properties in vitro.
TI  - Compositions and the in vitro antimicrobial activities of the essential oils of Achillea setacea and Achillea teretifolia (Compositae).
AB  - GC-MS analysis of the isolated essential oils from air-dried aerial parts of Achillea setacea and Achillea teretifolia, an endemic taxon, resulted in the identification of 51 constituents (79.8% of the total oil) and 42 constituents (87.1% of the total oil), respectively. Eucalyptol (1,8-cineole) was the major constituent of both oils studied (18.5 and 19.9%, respectively). The antimicrobial activities of the essential oils were individually evaluated against 14 microorganisms. Both oils exhibited inhibitory effects on Clostridium perfringens, Acinetobacter lwoffii and Candida albicans with a range of minimum inhibitory concentration values extended from 0.28 to 2.25 mg/ml. Camphor and their derivatives, borneol, terpinen-4-ol and eucalyptol (1,8-cineol) can be considered as the main antimicrobial constituents of the oils studied.
