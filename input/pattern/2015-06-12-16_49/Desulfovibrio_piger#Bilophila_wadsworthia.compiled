TI  - Diversity and distribution of sulphate-reducing bacteria in human faeces from healthy subjects and patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  - The relative abundance of different groups of sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in faecal DNA collected before and after therapy from patients suffering from Crohn's disease (CD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or ulcerative colitis (UC) has been compared with that from healthy controls. Growth tests revealed that SRB were not more abundant in samples from patients with CD before treatment than in the healthy control group. For most of the 128 samples available, these preliminary results were confirmed using degenerate PCR primers that amplify the dsrAB gene. However, some samples from patients with CD before treatment contained a growth inhibitor that was absent from IBS or UC samples. In-depth sequencing of PCR-generated dsrB fragments revealed that the diversity detected was surprisingly low, with only eight strains of SRB and the sulphite-reducing bacterium, Bilophila wadsworthia, detected above the 0.1% threshold. The proportion of the two major species detected, B. wadsworthia and Desulfovibrio piger, was as high as 93.5% of the total SRB population in the healthy control group and lower in all patient groups. Four previously undescribed species were found: it is impossible to predict whether they are sulphate or sulphite-reducing bacteria.
TI  - Abundance and diversity of mucosa-associated hydrogenotrophic microbes in the healthy human colon.
AB  - Hydrogenotrophic microbiota have a significant impact on colonic health; however, little is known about their diversity and ecology in situ. Here, molecular-based methods and multivariate analyses were used to examine the abundance and diversity of mucosa-associated hydrogenotrophic microbes in 90 biopsies collected from right colon, left colon and rectum of 25 healthy subjects. Functional genes of all three hydrogenotrophic groups were detected in at least one colonic region of all subjects. Methanogenic archaea (MA) constituted approximately one half of the hydrogenotrophic microbiota in each colonic region. Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) were more abundant than acetogens in right colon, while acetogens were more abundant than SRB in left colon and rectum. MA genotypes exhibited low diversity, whereas SRB genotypes were diverse and generally similar across the three regions within subject but significantly variable among subjects. Multivariate cluster analysis defined subject-specific patterns for the diversity of SRB genotypes; however, neither subject- nor region-specific clusters were observed for the abundance of hydrogenotrophic functional genes. Sequence analyses of functional gene clones revealed that mucosa-associated SRB were phylogenetically related to Desulfovibrio piger, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans and Bilophila wadsworthia; whereas MA were related to Methanobrevibacter spp., Mb. smithii and the order Methanomicrobiales. Together these data demonstrate for the first time that the human colonic mucosa is persistently colonized by all three groups of hydrogenotrophic microbes, which exhibit segmental and interindividual variation in abundance and diversity.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of porins from Desulfovibrio piger and Bilophila wadsworthia: structure and gene sequencing.
AB  - The outer membrane proteins of Desulfovibrio piger and Bilophila wadsworthia (Omp-DP and Omp-BW, respectively) and the genes encoding them (omp-DP and omp-BW) were isolated and characterized. Native Omp-DP and Omp-BW form a trimeric structure of approximately 120 kDa. These proteins disaggregated into monomers with a molecular weight of approximately 53 kDa after heating at 95 degrees C for 10 min. The pore-forming abilities of these oligomeric proteins demonstrated that they form small nonspecific channels with an exclusion limit of 260-300 Da. The omp-DP and omp-BW genes were cloned and sequenced. Sequence analyses revealed an open reading frame of 1,512 bp for omp-DP and 1,440 bp for omp-BW. The mature Omp-DP protein consisted of 480 amino acids and had a calculated MW of 53,290 Da. The mature Omp-BW protein consisted of 456 amino acids and had a calculated MW of 50.050 Da. Alignment of Omp-DP with Omp-BW revealed 54% homology, whereas alignment with other known porins showed a low level of homology. Analysis of the secondary structures indicated that both proteins span the outer membrane 18 times with amphipathic beta-strands. This research presents porins which were isolated and characterized for the first time from bacteria belonging to the Desulfovibrionaceae family.
TI  - Biochemical differentiation and comparison of Desulfovibrio species and other phenotypically similar genera.
AB  - Seventeen human clinical isolates representing four species of Desulfovibrio were characterized using 16S rRNA gene sequences and tests for catalase, indole, nitrate, bile, urease, formate-fumarate stimulation, desulfoviridin, motility, and hydrogen sulfide production, plus susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. Eighty additional strains representing 10 phenotypically similar genera (Bilophila, Selenomonas, Capnocytophaga, Campylobacter, Bacteroides, Sutterella, Anaerobiospirillum, Dialister, Veillonella, and Mobiluncus) were included for comparison. All Desulfovibrio species produced H2S and were desulfoviridin positive, and all Desulfovibrio species except D. piger were motile. The four Desulfovibrio species could be distinguished from each other using tests for catalase, indole, nitrate, urease, and growth on bile, with the following results (positive [+], negative [-], growth [G], and no growth [NG]): for D. piger, -, -, -, -, and G, respectively; for D. fairfieldensis, +, -, +, -, and G, respectively; for D. desulfuricans, -, -, +, +, and NG, respectively; and for D. vulgaris, -, +, -, -, and G, respectively. Resistance to the 10-microg colistin disk separated the Desulfovibrio species from most of the other genera, which were usually susceptible. These simple tests were useful for characterizing the Desulfovibrio species and differentiating them from other phenotypically similar genera.
