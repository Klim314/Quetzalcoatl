cloning, phenotypic expression, and dna sequence of the gene for lactacin f, an antimicrobial peptide produced by lactobacillus spp.
lactacin f is a heat-stable bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus 11088.
a 63-mer oligonucleotide probe deduced from the n-terminal lactacin f amino acid sequence was used to clone the putative laf structural gene from plasmid dna of a lactacin f-producing transconjugant, l. acidophilus t143.
one clone, nck360, harbored a recombinant plasmid, ptrk160, which contained a 2.2-kb ecori fragment of the size expected from hybridization experiments.
an escherichia coli-l. acidophilus shuttle vector was constructed, and a subclone (ptrk162) containing the 2.2-kb ecori fragment was introduced by electroporation into two lactacin f-negative strains, l. acidophilus 89 and 88-c. lactobacillus transformants containing ptrk162 expressed lactacin f activity and immunity.
bacteriocin produced by the transformants exhibited an inhibitory spectrum and heat stability identical to those of the wild-type bacteriocin.
an 873-bp region of the 2.2-kb fragment was sequenced by using a 20-mer degenerate lactacin f-specific primer to initiate sequencing from within the lactacin f structural gene.
analysis of the resulting sequence identified an open reading frame which could encode a protein of 75 amino acids.
the 25 n-terminal amino acids for lactacin f were identified within the open reading frame along with an n-terminal extension, possibly a signal sequence.
the lactacin f n-terminal sequence, through the remainder of the open reading frame (57 amino acids; 6.3 kda), correlated extremely well with composition analyses of purified lactacin f which also predicted a size of 51 to 56 amino acid residues.
molecular characterization of lactacin f identified a small hydrophobic peptide that may be representative of a common bacteriocin class in lactic acid bacteria.
