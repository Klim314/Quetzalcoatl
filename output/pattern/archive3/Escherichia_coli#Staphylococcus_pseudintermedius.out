the joint in vitro action of polymyxin b and miconazole against pathogens associated with canine otitis externa from three european countries.
background: canine otitis externa, an inflammation of the external ear canal, can be maintained and worsened by bacterial or fungal infections. for topical treatment, combinations of anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial ingredients are mainly used. hypothesis/objectives: this study was conducted to elucidate the in vitro activity of polymyxin b and miconazole against clinical bacterial isolates from three european countries, to investigate possible differences in sensitivity and to assess drug interactions. animals: seventeen strains of escherichia coli, 24 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 24 strains of proteus mirabilis and 25 strains of staphylococcus pseudintermedius from dogs with diagnosed otitis externa had been isolated in germany, france and italy. methods: drug activities were evaluated by minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration. the potentiation of polymyxin b plus miconazole was calculated using the fractional inhibitory concentration index (fici). an fici </=0.5 defined synergy. furthermore, geographical variations in the fici and mic were assessed by statistical analysis. results: bacterial susceptibilities were comparable in different european countries, because there were no significant mic and fici variations (p > 0.05). as a single agent, polymyxin b had bactericidal activity against most e. coli and p. aeruginosa strains and, in higher concentrations, against s. pseudintermedius strains. miconazole was bactericidal against all staphylococcus strains. synergy was demonstrated against strains of e. coli and p. aeruginosa (fici = 0.25 and 0.50, respectively), whereas overall there was no interaction against s. pseudintermedius strains (fici = 1.25). proteus mirabilis strains were not inhibited by each of the drugs individually or by their combination. conclusions and clinical importance: in vitro synergy of polymyxin b and miconazole against e. coli and p. aeruginosa isolates indicates a rationale for applying both agents in combination to treat otitis externa when infected with these types of bacteria.
mutant prevention concentration of orbifloxacin: comparison between escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus pseudintermedius of canine origin.
background: the mutant prevention concentration (mpc) is an important parameter to evaluate the likelihood of growth of fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants for antimicrobial-pathogen combinations. the mpcs of fluoroquinolones for different canine pathogens have not been compared. in this study, we compared for the first time orbifloxacin mpcs between susceptible strains of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus pseudintermedius of canine origin. methods: more than 1010 cfu/ml of 10 strains of each bacterial species were inoculated onto muller-hinton agar supplemented with different concentrations of orbifloxacin from 1x to 64x minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and the mpcs were recorded. mics of original strains and of mutants arising after exposure to sub-mpc concentrations (one per original strain) were determined in the presence or absence of efflux pump inhibitors (epis). the effects of quinolone resistance-determining region (qrdr) mutations were also examined. results: mpcs were significantly higher for p. aeruginosa (16-128 mug/ml) than for e. coli (0.5-32 mug/ml). mpcs for s. pseudintermedius varied between the low-susceptible (16-128 mug/ml) and the high-susceptible strains (4-16 mug/ml) and were the most broadly distributed among the three species. regarding resistance mechanisms, only one qrdr mutation in gyra was found in all of the 10 mutants of e. coli and in 4 of the 10 mutants of p. aeruginosa, whereas mutations in both grla and gyra were found in 3 mutants and one mutation in grla was found in 2 mutants among the 10 mutants of s. pseudintermedius. in the presence of an epi, the mics of p. aeruginosa mutants decreased markedly, those of e. coli mutants decreased moderately, and those of s. pseudintermedius mutants were unaffected. conclusions: mpcs of orbifloxacin vary between bacterial species of canine pathogens, possibly due to the diversity of the main fluoroquinolone resistance mechanism among these species. therefore, the type of bacterial species should be taken into consideration when using fluoroquinolone drugs such as orbifloxacin in canines.
occurrence of antimicrobial resistant bacteria in healthy dogs and cats presented to private veterinary hospitals in southern ontario: a preliminary study.
the prevalence and patterns of antimicrobial susceptibility of fecal escherichia  coli, salmonella spp., extended beta-lactamase producing e. coli (esbl-e. coli), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus pseudintermedius (mrsp) were determined for healthy dogs (n = 188) and cats (n = 39) from veterinary hospitals in southern ontario that had not had recent exposure to antimicrobials. the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in e. coli was as follows: streptomycin (dogs - 17%, cats - 2%), ampicillin (dogs - 13%, cats - 4%), cephalothin (dogs - 13%, cats - < 1%), and tetracycline (dogs - 11%, cats - 2%). eleven percent of dogs and 15% of cats had isolates that were resistant to at least 2 antimicrobials. cephamycinase (cmy)-2 producing e. coli was cultured from 2 dogs. no salmonella spp., esbl-e. coli, mrsa, or mrsp isolates were recovered. the observed prevalence of resistance in commensal e. coli from this population was lower than that previously reported in companion animals, but a small percentage of dogs may be a reservoir for cmy-2 e. coli.
