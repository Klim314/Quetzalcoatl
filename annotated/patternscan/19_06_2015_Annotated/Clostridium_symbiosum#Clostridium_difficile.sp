TI  == dehydration of (r)-2-hydroxyacyl-coa to enoyl-coa in the fermentation of alpha-amino acids by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == several clostridia and fusobacteria ferment alpha-amino acids via (r)-2-hydroxyacyl-coa, which is dehydrated to enoyl-coa by syn-elimination. this  reaction is of great mechanistic interest, since the beta-hydrogen, to be eliminated as proton, is not activated (pk 40-50). a mechanism has been proposed, in which one high-energy electron acts as cofactor and transiently reduces the electrophilic thiol ester carbonyl to a nucleophilic ketyl radical anion. the 2-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydratases are two-component systems composed of an extremely oxygen-sensitive component a, an activator, and component d, the actual dehydratase. component a, a homodimer with one [4fe-4s]cluster, transfers an electron to component d, a heterodimer with 1-2 [4fe-4s]clusters and fmn, concomitant with hydrolysis of two atp. from component d the electron is further  transferred to the substrate, where it facilitates elimination of the hydroxyl group. in the resulting enoxyradical the beta-hydrogen is activated (pk14). after elimination the electron is handed-over to the next incoming substrate without further hydrolysis of atp. the helix-cluster-helix architecture of component a forms an angle of 105 degrees, which probably opens to 180 degrees upon binding of atp resembling an archer shooting arrows. therefore we designated component a  as 'archerase'. here, we describe 2-hydroxyglutaryl-coa dehydratase from acidaminococcus fermentans, clostridium symbiosum and fusobacterium nucleatum, 2-phenyllactate dehydratase from clostridium sporogenes, 2-hydroxyisocaproyl-coa  dehydratase from clostridium difficile, and lactyl-coa dehydratase from clostridium propionicum. a relative of the 2-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydratases is benzoyl-coa reductase from thauera aromatica. analogous but unrelated archerases  are the iron proteins of nitrogenase and bacterial protochlorophyllide reductase. in anaerobic organisms, which do not oxidize 2-oxo acids, a second energy-driven  electron transfer from nadh to ferredoxin, the electron donor of component a, has been established. the transfer is catalysed by a membrane-bound nadh-ferredoxin oxidoreductase driven by an electrochemical na(+)-gradient. this enzyme is related to the rnf proteins involved in rhodobacter capsulatus nitrogen fixation.

TI  == exchange of domains of glutamate dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon pyrococcus furiosus and the mesophilic bacterium clostridium difficile:  effects on catalysis, thermoactivity and stability.
AB  == the glutamate dehydrogenase gene from the hyperthermophilic archaeon pyrococcus furiosus has been functionally expressed in escherichia coli under the control of the lambda pl promoter. the p. furiosus glutamate dehydrogenase amounted to 20% of the total e. coli cell protein, and the vast majority consisted of hexamers. following activation by heat treatment, an enzyme could be purified from e. coli  that was indistinguishable from the glutamate dehydrogenase purified from p. furiosus. hybrid genes, that consisted of the coding regions for the homologous glutamate dehydrogenases from p. furiosus and the mesophilic bacterium clostridium difficile, were constructed and successfully expressed in e. coli. one of the resulting hybrid proteins, containing the glutamate binding domain of  the c. difficile enzyme and the cofactor binding domain of the p. furiosus enzyme, did not show a detectable activity. in contrast, the complementary hybrid containing the p. furiosus glutamate and the c. difficile cofactor binding domain was a catalytically active hexamer that showed a reduced substrate affinity but maintained efficient cofactor binding with the specificity found in the clostridium symbiosum enzyme. compared with the c. difficile glutamate dehydrogenase, the archaeal-bacterial hybrid is slightly more thermoactive, less  thermostable but much more stable towards guanidinium chloride-induced inactivation and denaturation.

TI  == in vitro activity of meropenem compared with imipenem, metronidazole, ampicillin, and ampicillin/sulbactam against anaerobes.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to compare the in vitro activity of meropenem (ici 194660, cas 96036-03-2) with imipenem, metronidazole, clindamycin, ampicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam against a variety of anaerobic bacteria using an agar dilution method. 423 clinical isolates were tested belonging to 70 species of 15 anaerobic genera. they included bacteroides fragilis (n = 62), bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (n = 45), prevotella bivia (n = 11), fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 12), clostridium perfringens (n = 15) and several rarely isolated  species and genera, e.g. selenomonas sputigena and clostridium symbiosum. bacteroides species were inhibited by meropenem at < or = 2.0 micrograms/ml, clostridium species, including c. difficile, at < or = 4.0 micrograms/ml and all  the other anaerobes at < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. meropenem and imipenem were the most active substances, but often equal to, or only slightly better than, metronidazole, clindamycin or ampicillin/sulbactam, dependent on species. meropenem was especially active against bacteroides gracilis (mic90 0.015 microgram/ml), prevotella disiens (mic90 0.03 microgram/ml), fusobacterium nucleatum (mic90 0.015 microgram/ml), clostridium perfringens (mic90 0.015 microgram/ml) and veillonella parvula (mic90 0.03 microgram/ml). the results obtained indicate that meropenem might be a useful adjunct to chemotherapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections.
