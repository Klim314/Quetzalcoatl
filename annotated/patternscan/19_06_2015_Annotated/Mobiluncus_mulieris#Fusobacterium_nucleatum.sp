TI  == the influence of biofilm formation by gardnerella vaginalis and other anaerobes on bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the worldwide leading vaginal disorder in women of reproductive age. bv is characterized by the replacement of beneficial lactobacilli and the augmentation of anaerobic bacteria. gardnerella vaginalis is a predominant bacterial species, however, bv is also associated with other numerous anaerobes, such as atopobium vaginae, mobiluncus mulieris, prevotella bivia, fusobacterium nucleatum and peptoniphilus sp.. currently, the role of g. vaginalis in the etiology of bv remains a matter of controversy. it is however known that, in bv patients, a biofilm is usually formed on the vaginal epithelium and g. vaginalis is typically the predominant species. so, the current paradigm is that the establishment of a biofilm plays a key role in the pathogenesis of bv. this review provides background on the influence of biofilm formation by g. vaginalis and other anaerobes in the polymicrobial etiology of bv, through its initial adhesion until biofilm formation and discusses the commensal and synergic interactions established between them to understand the phenotypic shift of g. vaginalis' biofilms into bv establishment.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == preterm birth: associations with genital and possibly oral microflora.
AB  == opportunistic pathogenic microbes are indigenous to the female lower genital tract and etiologic in many types of pelvic infections and, apparently, a portion of preterm birth (ptb) cases. bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a clinical syndrome based on an altered genital microflora in which gardnerella vaginalis; anaerobic  species primarily among prevotella, porphyromonas, bacteroides, peptostreptococcus, and mobiluncus; mycoplasma hominis; and ureaplasma urealyticum become predominant in vaginal secretions. this bv complex of microbes, compared to a normal vaginal microflora dominated by facultative lactobacilli, is associated with significantly increased risks for preterm labor, preterm premature rupture of membranes, ptb, and other perinatal infectious complications. pathogenetic mechanisms include an ascending route of infection and/or inflammatory process due to microbial products and maternal and/or fetal response(s) with production of prostaglandins and cytokines. in the presence of periodontal disease, oral opportunistic pathogens and/or their inflammatory products also may have a role in prematurity via a hematogenous route. fusobacterium nucleatum, a common oral species, is the most frequently isolated species from amniotic fluid cultures among women with preterm labor and intact membranes. also, the species and subspecies of fusobacteria identified from amniotic fluid most closely match those reported from healthy and diseased subgingival sites, namely f. nucleatum subspecies vincentii and f. nucleatum subspecies nucleatum, compared to strains identified from the lower genital tract. although these fusobacteria also could be acquired through cunnilingus from a partner, new data associating maternal periodontal disease with preterm low birth weight taken with the isolation of f. nucleatum, capnocytophaga, and other oral species from amniotic fluid support further study of a possible additional route, oral-hematogenous, to ptb.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis and vaginal microorganisms in idiopathic premature labor and  association with pregnancy outcome.
AB  == the vaginal microflora of 49 women in idiopathic preterm labor was compared with  that of 38 term controls to determine whether the presence of bacterial vaginosis (bv) and/or specific microorganisms would influence the rate of preterm delivery. demographic factors, pregnancy outcome, and reproductive history were also studied. bv, as defined by the presence of clue cells in a vaginal wet mount and  characteristic microbial findings in a stained vaginal smear and vaginal culture, was more common in women with preterm labor and delivery than in controls (p < 0.01). the condition, diagnosed in 41% of women who had both preterm labor and delivery (n = 22) and in 11% each of women who had preterm labor but term delivery (n = 27) and controls, was associated with a 2.1-fold risk (95% confidence intervals, 1.2 to 3.7) for preterm birth prior to 37 weeks of gestation. bv was associated with low birth weight. of 49 women with preterm labor, 67% (8 of 12) of women with bv were delivered of low-birth-weight neonates (< 2,500 g) compared with 22% (8 of 37) of women without the condition (p < 0.0005). the presence of hydrogen peroxide-producing facultative lactobacillus spp. was strongly negatively associated with both preterm delivery and bv. bv-associated microorganisms, i.e., mobiluncus, prevotella, and peptostreptococcus species, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, fusobacterium nucleatum, mycoplasma hominis, and high numbers of gardnerella vaginalis were significantly associated with preterm delivery; all species also strongly associated with bv (p = 0.0001 for each comparison). mobiluncus curtisii and fusobacterium nucleatum were recovered exclusively from women with preterm delivery. our study clearly indicates that bv and its associated organisms are correlated with idiopathic premature delivery.

TI  == the normal vaginal flora, h2o2-producing lactobacilli, and bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women.
AB  == in this study of the vaginal flora of 171 pregnant women in labor at term, the flora was categorized as normal (lactobacillus predominant), intermediate, or representative of bacterial vaginosis (bv) on the basis of a vaginal smear. bv was diagnosed in 39 women (23%); the vaginal flora was classified as normal in 50% of cases and as intermediate in 27%. h2o2-producing lactobacilli were recovered from 5% of women with bv, 37% of those with an intermediate flora, and  61% of those with a normal flora. h2o2-negative lactobacilli were equally frequent (57%-65%) in all three groups. the microorganisms most frequently recovered from women with bv included gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia/disiens, bacteroides ureolyticus, prevotella corporis/bacteroides levii, fusobacterium nucleatum, mobiluncus species, peptostreptococcus prevotii, peptostreptococcus tetradius, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, viridans streptococci, ureaplasma urealyticum, and mycoplasma hominis (p < .05 for each).  the presence of all but three of these organisms was inversely related to vaginal colonization by h2o2-producing lactobacilli; the exceptions were b. ureolyticus,  f. nucleatum, and p. prevotii. other microorganisms were equally frequent among women with and without bv. we conclude that specific groups of anaerobes are associated with bv in this population and that a strong association exists between species associated with bv and those inhibited by h2o2-producing lactobacilli.

TI  == in vitro activity of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, and flomoxef against 322 recent clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. a fastidious facultative anaerobe, gardnerella vaginalis, was also studied. fk037 inhibited 90% of isolates of peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, clostridium perfringens, mobiluncus spp., g. vaginalis, and porphyromonas gingivalis at < or = 0.78 micrograms/ml. the mics of fk037 for 50 and 90% of bacteroides fragilis isolates were 25 and > 200 micrograms/ml, respectively; the activity of fk037 was comparable to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime but lower than that of flomoxef. the activity of fk037  against fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium varium, and bilophila wadsworthia  decreased when inoculum size was increased from 10(6) to 10(8) cfu/ml. little influence of inoculum size on the activity of fk037 was observed for other isolates tested. medium ph affected the activity of fk037 against f. varium (mics at phs 5 and 7, 3.13 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively) and bacteroides gracilis (mics at phs 5 and 7, 12.5 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively) but not against other organisms tested. fk037 was less resistant than flomoxef to hydrolysis by beta-lactamase group 2e derived from b. fragilis gai 0558 and gai 10150.
