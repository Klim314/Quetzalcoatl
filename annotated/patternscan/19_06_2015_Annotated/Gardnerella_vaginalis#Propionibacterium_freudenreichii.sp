TI  == identification and quantification of bifidobacterium species isolated from food with genus-specific 16s rrna-targeted probes by colony hybridization and pcr.
AB  == a bifidobacterium genus-specific target sequence in the v9 variable region of the 16s rrna has been elaborated and was used to develop a hybridization probe. the specificity of this probe, named lm3 (5'-cgggtgcti*cccactttcatg-3'), was used to  identify all known type strains and distinguish them from other bacteria. all of  the 30 type strains of bifidobacterium which are available at the german culture  collection deutsche sammlung von mikroorganismen und zellkulturen, 6 commercially available production strains, and 34 closely related relevant strains (as negative controls) were tested. all tested bifidobacteria showed distinct positive signals by colony hybridization, whereas all negative controls showed no distinct dots except gardnerella vaginalis dsm4944 and propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii dsm4902, which gave slight signals. furthermore,  we established a method for isolation and identification of bifidobacteria from food by using a pcr assay without prior isolation of dna but breaking the cells with proteinase k. by this method, all bifidobacterium strains lead to a dna product of the expected size. we also established a quick assay to quantitatively measure bifidobacterium counts in food and feces by dilution plating and colony hybridization. we were able to demonstrate that 2.1 x 10(6) to 2.3 x 10(7) colonies/g of sour milk containing bifidobacteria hybridized with the specific nucleotide probe. with these two methods, genus-specific colony hybridization and genus-specific pcr, it is now possible to readily and accurately detect any bifidobacteria in food and fecal samples and to discriminate between them and members of other genera.
