TI  == comparison of the antibacterial properties of three mouthwashes containing chlorhexidine against oral microbial plaques: an in vitro study.
AB  == background: the mouth provides an environment that allows the colonization and growth of a wide variety of microorganisms, especially bacteria. one of the most  effective ways to reduce oral microorganisms is using mouthwashes. objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial effects of chlorhexidine mouthwashes (manufacture by livar, behsa, boht) on common oral microorganisms. materials and methods: in this in vitro study, isolated colonies  of four bacteria, including streptococcus mutans, s. sanguinis, s. salivarius and lactobacillus casei, were prepared for an antimicrobial mouth rinse test. the tube dilution method was used for determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc). results: the  mics for kin gingival, behsa and boht mouthwashes were 0.14, 0.48 and 1000 micrograms/ml using the tube method for s. mutans, respectively. the mbcs for the mentioned mouthwashes were 0.23, 1.9 and 2000 micrograms/ml for s. mutans, respectively. the mics for kin gingival, behsa and boht mouthwashes were 0.073, 0.48 and 250 micrograms/ml using the tube method for s. sanguinis, respectively.  the mbcs for the mentioned mouthwashes were 0.14, 1.9 and 1000 micrograms/ml for  s. sanguinis, respectively. conclusions: the kin gingival chlorhexidine mouthwash has a greater effect than behsa and boht mouthwashes on oral microorganisms and is recommended to be used for plaque chemical inhibition.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of apitoxin, melittin and phospholipase a(2) of honey bee  (apis mellifera) venom against oral pathogens.
AB  == in this work, we used the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) technique to evaluate the antibacterial potential of the apitoxin produced by apis mellifera bees against the causative agents of tooth decay. apitoxin was assayed in natura  and in the commercially available form. the antibacterial actions of the main components of this apitoxin, phospholipase a2, and melittin were also assessed, alone and in combination. the following bacteria were tested: streptococcus salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, lactobacillus casei,  and enterococcus faecalis. the mic results obtained for the commercially available apitoxin and for the apitoxin in natura were close and lay between 20 and 40 microg / ml, which indicated good antibacterial activity. melittin was the most active component in apitoxin; it displayed very promising mic values, from 4 to 40 microg / ml. phospholipase a2 presented mic values higher than 400 microg / ml. association of mellitin with phospholipase a2 yielded mic values ranging between 6 and 80 microg / ml. considering that tooth decay affects people's health, apitoxin and its component melittin have potential application against oral pathogens.

TI  == antifouling coatings for dental implants: polyethylene glycol-like coatings on titanium by plasma polymerization.
AB  == titanium dental implants are commonly used for the replacement of lost teeth, but they present a considerable number of failures due to the infection on surrounding tissues. the aim of this paper is the development of a polyethylene glycol-like (peg-like) coating on the titanium surface by plasma polymerization to obtain a novel improved surface with suitable low bacterial adhesion and adequate cell response. surface analysis data of these coatings are presented, in particular, water contact angle, surface roughness, and film chemistry, demonstrating the presence of a peg-like coating. streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus salivarius bacterial adhesion assays showed a decreased adhesion on the plasma polymerized samples, while cell adhesion of fibroblasts and osteoblasts on the treated surfaces was similar to control surfaces. thus, the peg-like antifouling coating obtained by plasma polymerization on ti confers this biomaterial's highly suitable properties for dental applications, as they reduce  the possibility of infection while allowing the tissue integration around the implant.

TI  == antibacterial properties of hlf1-11 peptide onto titanium surfaces: a comparison  study between silanization and surface initiated polymerization.
AB  == dental implant failure can be associated with infections that develop into peri-implantitis. in order to reduce biofilm formation, several strategies focusing on the use of antimicrobial peptides (amps) have been studied. to covalently immobilize these molecules onto metallic substrates, several techniques have been developed, including silanization and polymer brush prepared by surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (atrp), with varied peptide binding yield and antibacterial performance. the aim of the present study was to compare the efficiency of these methods to immobilize the lactoferrin-derived hlf1-11 antibacterial peptide onto titanium, and evaluate their antibacterial activity in vitro. smooth titanium samples were coated with hlf1-11 peptide under three different conditions: silanization with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (aptes), and polymer brush based coatings with two different silanes. peptide presence was determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and the mechanical stability of the coatings was studied under ultrasonication. the ldh assays confirmed that hffs viability and proliferation were no affected by the treatments. the in vitro antibacterial properties of the  modified surfaces were tested with two oral strains (streptococcus sanguinis and  lactobacillus salivarius) showing an outstanding reduction. a higher decrease in  bacterial attachment was noticed when samples were modified by atrp methods compared to silanization. this effect is likely due to the capacity to immobilize more peptide on the surfaces using polymer brushes and the nonfouling nature of polymer pdma segment.

TI  == propolis varnish: antimicrobial properties against cariogenic bacteria, cytotoxicity, and sustained-release profile.
AB  == varnishes are preparations that differ in the polymeric matrix and therapeutical  agents. in dentistry they are used to prevent caries. in this study we developed  a propolis varnish, considering propolis properties against cariogenic bacteria.  to a chitosan polymeric base (chv) was added ethanolic propolis extract in different concentrations: pv1 (5%), pv2 (10%), and pv3 (15%). antimicrobial activity was carried out against streptococcus mutans (sm), streptococcus sanguinis (sg), streptococcus salivarius (ss), and lactobacillus casei (lc) through agar diffusion method. the three propolis concentrations incorporated were effective in inhibiting the growth of all microorganisms, but without significant difference between the zones of inhibition observed. cytotoxicity assay was done by mtt method. data were analyzed by one-way anova and bonferroni  test. none of the varnishes were cytotoxic, keeping 80% of viable cells, while chv allowed cellular proliferation (120%). sustained-release test was carried out by applying 40 mu l of each varnish in the buccal surface of bovine teeth and kept in an ethanol/water solution removed in regular times. according to the "independent model approach," the release profiles were distinct from each varnish and the most prolonged was pv3 (8 weeks). varnish formulations had satisfactory antimicrobial activity against cariogenic bacteria and have a low cytotoxicity (<50%).

TI  == silver deposition on titanium surface by electrochemical anodizing process reduces bacterial adhesion of streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus salivarius.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to determine the antibacterial properties of silver-doped titanium surfaces prepared with a novel electrochemical anodizing process. material and methods: titanium samples were anodized with a pulsed process in a solution of silver nitrate and sodium thiosulphate at room temperature with stirring. samples were processed with different electrolyte concentrations and treatment cycles to improve silver deposition. physicochemical properties were determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, contact angle measurements, white-light interferometry, and scanning electron microscopy. cellular cytotoxicity in human fibroblasts was studied with lactate dehydrogenase assays. the in vitro effect of treated surfaces on two oral bacteria strains (streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus salivarius) was studied with viable bacterial adhesion measurements and growth curve assays. nonparametric statistical kruskal-wallis and mann-whitney u-tests were used for multiple and paired comparisons, respectively. post hoc spearman's correlation tests were calculated to check the dependence between bacteria adhesion and surface properties. results: x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results confirmed the presence of silver on treated samples and showed that treatments with higher silver nitrate concentration and more cycles increased the silver deposition on titanium surface. no negative effects in fibroblast cell viability were detected  and a significant reduction on bacterial adhesion in vitro was achieved in silver-treated samples compared with control titanium. conclusions: silver deposition on titanium with a novel electrochemical anodizing process produced surfaces with significant antibacterial properties in vitro without negative effects on cell viability.

TI  == covalent immobilization of hlf1-11 peptide on a titanium surface reduces bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation.
AB  == bacterial infection represents a major cause of implant failure in dentistry. a common approach to overcoming this issue and treating peri-implant infection consists in the use of antibiotics. however, the rise of multidrug-resistant bacteria poses serious concerns to this strategy. a promising alternative is the  use of antimicrobial peptides due to their broad-spectrum activity against bacteria and reduced bacterial resistance responses. the aim of the present study was to determine the in vitro antibacterial activity of the human lactoferrin-derived peptide hlf1-11 anchored to titanium surfaces. to this end, titanium samples were functionalized with the hlf1-11 peptide either by silanization methods or physical adsorption. x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses confirmed the successful covalent attachment of the hlf1-11 peptide onto titanium surfaces. lactate dehydrogenase assay determined that hlf1-11 peptide did not affect fibroblast viability. an outstanding reduction in the adhesion and early stages of biofilm formation of streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus salivarius was observed on the biofunctionalized surfaces compared to control non-treated samples. furthermore, samples coated with the hlf1-11 peptide inhibited the early stages of bacterial growth. thus, this strategy holds great potential to develop antimicrobial biomaterials for dental applications.

TI  == antibacterial activity of selected glass ionomer cements.
AB  == introduction: the aim of the paper was to determine the antibacterial activity of four glass ionomer cements against bacteria of the genera streptococcus and lactobacillus. material and methods: four capsulated glass ionomer cements were applied in the study: fuji triage (gc), fuji ix (gc), ketac molar (3m espe) and ketac silver (3m espe). four standard bacterial strains were used to assess the antibacterial activity of the studied cements: streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis,  s. salivarius and lactobacillus casei. the antibacterial activity was determined  by the agar diffusion method. the bacterial suspension was spread with a cotton swab on tsa plates. for each material six wells (7 mm diameter, 5 mm deep) were made with a cork borer. each well was then filled with freshly prepared cements.  the results were obtained by measuring the bacterial growth inhibition zone after 1, 2, 3 and 7 days. results: fuji triage cement inhibited the growth of all bacterial strains. fuji ix cement demonstrated the most potent antibacterial activity against s. sanguis. ketac molar showed antibacterial activity against s. sanguis and s. salivarius, whereas ketac silver was efficient against s. mutans as well. neither of the ketac cements inhibited growth of the standard l. casei strain. discussion: antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements has attracted the interest of scientists in recent years. most authors, including us, carried out experiments using the agar diffusion method and demonstrated antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements. different antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements, observed in our study and studies of other authors, depended on  the evaluated cement, bacterial strain and period of evaluation.

TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic growth effects of lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus salivarius and their fermentative broth on periodontal pathogens.
AB  == as lactobacilli possess an antagonistic growth property, these bacteria may be beneficial as bioprotective agents for infection control. however, whether the antagonistic growth effects are attributed to the lactobacilli themselves or their fermentative broth remains unclear. the antagonistic growth effects of lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus fermentum as well as their fermentative broth were thus tested using both disc agar diffusion test and broth dilution method, and their effects on periodontal pathogens, including streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and porphyromonas gingivalis in vitro at different concentrations and for different time periods were also compared. both lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus fermentum and their concentrated fermentative broth were shown to inhibit significantly the growth of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and porphyromonas gingivalis, although different inhibitory effects were observed for different pathogens. the  higher the counts of lactobacilli and the higher the folds of concentrated fermentative broth, the stronger the inhibitory effects are observed. the inhibitory effect is demonstrated to be dose-dependent. moreover, for the lactobacilli themselves, lactobacillus fermentum showed stronger inhibitory effects than lactobacillus salivarius. however, the fermentative broth of lactobacillus fermentum showed weaker inhibitory effects than that of lactobacillus salivarius. these data suggested that lactobacilli and their fermentative broth exhibit antagonistic growth activity, and consumption of probiotics or their broth containing lactobacilli may benefit oral health.

TI  == antibacterial effect of different concentrations of garlic (allium sativum) extract on dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == background: allium sativum, commonly known as garlic, exhibits antibacterial effects against a wide range of bacteria. aim: the objective of this in vitro study was to assess the antibacterial effect of different concentrations of garlic extract against human dental plaque microbiota. materials and methods: antibacterial activities of four different concentrations of garlic extract (5%,  10%, 20%, and 100%) were evaluated against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and lactobacillus spp. using the disk diffusion method. papers soaked in 0.2% concentration chlorhexidine gluconate and saline were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. the data were subjected to one-way anova and the tukey multiple comparisons test at a 5% significance level. results: all bacterial strains were  inhibited by all test materials. the inhibition zones of the different concentrations of garlic extract were not significantly different for s. mutans,  s. sanguis, and s. salivarius. for p. aeruginosa and lactobacillus spp. the inhibition zones of 5%, 10% and 20% concentrations were not significantly different from one another, but they were significantly more than that of the 100% extract. conclusion: the 5%, 10%, 20%, and 100% concentrations of garlic extract had similar effects, so further studies seem to be indicated on the usefulness of the 5% extract.

TI  == a defined-multispecies microbial model for studying enamel caries development.
AB  == the aims of this study were to describe and validate an in vitro multispecies microbial biofilm model for caries development by evaluating the effects of varying medium concentration of sucrose (0.5 and 1.0%) and fluoride (0.4, 0.8 and 1.0 ppm f) in study 1, and calcium (1.0 and 2.0 mm ca) in study 2. defined-multispecies biofilms, formed by lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, were grown on the surface of salivary-pellicle-coated enamel slabs, with known baseline surface hardness; growth medium was changed daily. counts of viable cells on biofilms and the percentage of surface microhardness change (%smc), lesion depth (ld) and integrated mineral loss (iml) on enamel slabs were assessed after 4 days of biofilm formation under the tested conditions. counts of viable cells on biofilms were significantly affected by sucrose, fluoride and calcium concentrations (p <  0.05). there was a decrease in %smc in response to increased fluoride and calcium concentrations (p < 0.001). lower iml (p < 0.001) and ld (p < 0.05) were found in the presence of 0.8 and 1.0 ppm f. a negative correlation was found between the response variables (%smc, ld and iml) and fluoride and calcium concentrations. the results suggest that the microbial caries model developed was able to show distinct levels of caries inhibition in response to fluoride and calcium concentrations, corroborating clinical observations. an effect of sucrose concentration on caries development was found only in the presence of the lowest  fluoride concentration.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial comparison of chlorhexidine, persica mouthwash and miswak  extract.
AB  == aim: herbal mouthwashes, such as persica (salvadora persica, mint and yarrow extracts) and miswak extract have been shown to decrease gingival inflammation and plaque accumulation. the aim of this study was to compare the antimicrobial activities of persica and miswak extract with the conventional mouthwash chlorhexidine against streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, lactobacillus vulgaris and candida albicans. materials and methods: in this in vitro study, blood-agar culture (merk, germany) was used to grow the streptococcus strains, saburd-dextrose culture (merk, germany) was used to grow c. albicans and mrs-agar was used to grow l. vulgaris. various concentrations of  these substances (0.1, 0.05 and 0.025% of miswak extract, 0.1, 0.05, 0.025 and 0.0125% of persica, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05 and 0.025% of chlorhexidine) were added to paper disks, separately, inserted into culture plates and transferred into the incubator. the inhibition zone around each disk was measured after 24 hours and the data was analyzed by the kruskal-wallis test. results: chlorhexidine possessed antibacterial activity at all concentrations tested. it was more effective than persica and miswak at all concentrations on s. salivarius (p = 0.022 for 0.1%, 0.009 for 0.05 and 0.025%). it had greater effect than the other  two tested material on s.sanguis only at concentration 0.01%. chlorhexidine was the most effective against s.salivarius; persica was the most effective against lactobacillus (p = 0.005) and the least effective against s. salivarius; and miswak extract was the most effective against s. salivarius and s. sanguis at concentrations 0.1 and 0.05% (p = 0.005) and ineffective against l. vulgaris. none of these mouthwashes were effective against c. albicans. conclusion: this study revealed that chlorhexidine remains the gold standard as an antimicrobial agent, although herbal based mouthwashes do have marginal antimicrobial activities. it is necessary to conduct more clinical and microbiological studies  focusing on periodontal pathogens and anaerobic microorganisms. clinical significance: mechanical plaque control is the main way for periodontal disease prevention and mouthrinses are used to improve its efficacy. based on the results of this study, chlorhexidine has the most antibacterial effect and although persica mouthwash and miswak are routinely used in some asian countries their antibacterial efficacies are suspected.

TI  == effect of oral bacteria on the mechanical behavior of titanium dental implants.
AB  == purpose: this study sought to determine whether the mechanical properties of titanium dental implants changed after exposure to bacteria. materials and methods: two strains of bacteria (streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus salivarius) were used in the study. the adhesive properties of the two strains were investigated as follows. titanium implants were placed in bacteria broth, seeded with the two bacteria strains, and left in the broth for 1 or 3 months. another group of titanium implants was immersed in artificial saliva at 37 degrees c for 3 months. ten implants in each group were tested in 37 degrees c artificial saliva to evaluate their mechanical flexural strength and fatigue life. results: the bacterial cultures grew quickly on titanium surfaces. after 1  month of bacteria culture in vitro, the bacteria had produced corrosion pits on the titanium surfaces. after 3 months of bacterial culture, a 7% decrease in the  flexural strength of the implant samples and a decrease of 15% in the number of cycles to failure by fatigue were seen versus implants not exposed to bacteria. conclusions: these results demonstrate that, in physiologic conditions in vitro,  bacteria have the capacity to produce a pitting corrosion phenomenon on exposed titanium surfaces, leading to a significant deterioration in the mechanical properties of the implant. it is therefore logical to conclude that bacteria may  produce corrosion that reduces the useful life of dental implants.

TI  == in situ analysis of multispecies biofilm formation on customized titanium surfaces.
AB  == many studies to identify surfaces that enhance the incorporation of dental implants into bone and soft-tissue have been undertaken previously. however, to succeed in the clinical situation, an implant surface must not support development of microbial biofilms with a pathogenic potential. as a first step in investigating this, we used two-species and three-species biofilm models with 16s ribosomal rna fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal laser scanning microscopy to examine the effect of surface characteristics on biofilm formation  by species that can colonize titanium implants in vivo: streptococcus sanguinis,  actinomyces naeslundii and lactobacillus salivarius. surfaces blasted with al(2)  o(3) (s(a) = 1.0-2.0 mum) showed a seven-fold higher bacterial adhesion after 2 h than turned surfaces (s(a) = 0.18 mum) whereas porous surfaces, generated by anodic oxidation (s(a) = 0.4 mum), showed four-fold greater adhesion than turned  surfaces. hence, increased roughness promoted adhesion, most likely through protection of bacteria from shear forces. chemical modification of the blasted and oxidized surfaces by incorporation of ca(2+) ions reduced adhesion compared with the corresponding non-modified surfaces. after 14 h, biofilm growth occurred in the three-species model but not in the two-species consortium (containing s. sanguinis and a. naeslundii only). the biofilm biovolume on all surfaces was similar, suggesting that the influence of surface characteristics on adhesion was compensated for by biofilm development.

TI  == the effect of xylitol on the composition of the oral flora: a pilot study.
AB  == objectives: our aim was to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the microbial composition of plaque and saliva. methods: twelve volunteers (22-38 yrs) harboring mutans streptococci (ms) participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. the experimental chewing gum contained 65% xylitol while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol and 2% maltitol w/w. the polyol dose was approximately 6 g/day. stimulated saliva and plaque samples were collected before and after the two four-week test periods. the samples were cultured for ms, total streptococci, lactobacilli, and total facultatives. a part of the samples were subjected to dna-dna hybridizations of 14 microbial plaque species: actinomyces naeslundii, a. viscosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. paracasei, l. rhamnose, l. plantarum, streptococcus gordonii, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, veillonella parvula. results: the ms counts of the plaque samples collected from "caries-prone" tooth sites decreased significantly (p<.01) in the  xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. also the plaque ms percentage decreased significantly in the xylitol gum group (p<.01). the salivary ms counts did not decrease either in the xylitol or in the sorbitol gum groups. nor were changes detected in the salivary levels of total streptococci or lactobacilli. the dna-dna hybridization assay revealed no study-induced changes in the microbial composition of the dental plaque. conclusions: within the limitations of this pilot study, xylitol consumption reduced ms counts in plaque  but appeared not to affect the microbial composition of plaque or saliva in general.

TI  == anticariogenic properties of ent-pimarane diterpenes obtained by microbial transformation.
AB  == in the present work, the anticariogenic activities of three pimarane-type diterpenes obtained by fungal biotransformation were investigated. among these metabolites, ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol was the most active compound, displaying very promising mic values (ranging from 1.5 to 4.0 mug ml(-1)) against the main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: streptococcus salivarius,  s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, and lactobacillus casei. time kill assays performed with ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol against the primary causative agent s. mutans revealed that this compound only avoids growth of the inoculum in the first 12 h (bacteriostatic effect). however, its bactericidal effect is clearly noted thereafter (between 12 and 24 h). the curve profile obtained by combining ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol and chlorhexidine revealed a  significant reduction in the time necessary for killing s. mutans compared with each of these two chemicals alone. however, no synergistic effect was observed using the same combination in the checkerboard assays against this microorganism. in conclusion, our results point out that ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol is an important metabolite in the search for new effective anticariogenic agents.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of terpenoids from copaifera langsdorffii desf. against cariogenic bacteria.
AB  == in the present work, the anticariogenic activities of nine labdane type-diterpenes and four sesquiterpenes were investigated. among these metabolites, (-)-copalic acid (ca) was the most active compound displaying mic values very promising (ranging from 2.0 to 6.0 microg/ml) against the main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: streptococcus salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis and lactobacillus casei. time kill assays performed with ca against the primary causative agent (s. mutans) revealed that, in the first 12 h, this compound only inhibits the growth of the inoculum (bacteriostatic effect). however, its bactericidal effect is clearly noted thereafter (between 12 and 24 h). also, ca did not show a synergistic effect when combined with the anticariogenic gold standard (chlorhexidine, chd) in the checkerboard assays against s. mutans. in conclusion, the results points out ca as an important metabolite in the search for new effective anticariogenic agents.

TI  == screening of quercus infectoria gall extracts as anti-bacterial agents against dental pathogens.
AB  == background and objectives: a number of bacteria have now become antibiotic-resistant. this increases the importance of ayurvedic drugs. we report, here, the activity of different extracts (petroleum ether, chloroform, methanol and water) of quercus infectoria galls against dental pathogens -- streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus acidophilus (designated) and streptococcus sanguis (isolated). materials and methods: the cup-plate method was used in anti-bacterial activity of the extracts at concentration of 200 mg/ml against dental pathogens. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values of most effective extracts against the most susceptible bacteria were determined using a two-fold serial micro dilution method. results: methanolic extract showed maximum anti-bacterial activity against all the bacteria. the most susceptible bacteria were s. sanguis followed  by s. aureus, s. mutans, s. salivarius and l. acidophilus. the mic values showed  that methanolic extract was more effective than water extract. conclusion: the plant has the potential to generate herbal metabolites. the crude extracts demonstrating anti-dental caries activity could result in the discovery of new chemical classes of antibiotics. these chemical classes of antibiotics could serve as selective agents for the maintenance of human health and provide bio-chemical tools for the study of infectious diseases.

AB  == seven pimarane type-diterpenes re-isolated from viguiera arenaria baker and two semi-synthetic pimarane derivatives were evaluated in vitro against the following main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: streptococcus salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis and lactobacillus casei. the compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid (pa); ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol; ent-15-pimarene-8beta,19-diol; ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-acetoxy and the sodium salt derivative of pa were the most active compounds, displaying mic values ranging from 2 to 8 microg ml(-1). thus, this class of compounds seems promising as a class of new effective anticariogenic agents. furthermore, our results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new natural compounds that could be employed in the development of oral care products.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of kaurane diterpenes against oral pathogens.
AB  == two kaurane diterpenes, ent-kaur-16(17)-en-19-oic acid (ka) and 15-beta-isovaleryloxy-ent-kaur-16(17)-en-19-oic acid (ka-ival), isolated from aspilia foliacea, and the methyl ester derivative of ka (ka-me) were evaluated against oral pathogens. ka was the most active compound, with mic values of 10 microg ml(-1) against the following microorganisms: streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, and lactobacillus casei. however, ka did not show significant activity against streptococcus salivarius and enterococcus faecalis, with mic values equal to 100  and 200 microg ml(-1), respectively. our results show that ka has potential to be used as a prototype for the discovery of new effective anti-infection agents against microorganisms responsible for caries and periodontal diseases. moreover, these results allow to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to studies on the structure-activity relationship of this type of metabolites with respect to caries and periodontal diseases.

TI  == anticariogenic activity of macelignan isolated from myristica fragrans (nutmeg) against streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the occurrence of dental caries is mainly associated with oral pathogens, especially cariogenic streptococcus mutans. preliminary antibacterial screening revealed that the extract of myristica fragrans, widely cultivated for the spice  and flavor of foods, possessed strong inhibitory activity against s. mutans. the  anticariogenic compound was successfully isolated from the methanol extract of m. fragrans by repeated silica gel chromatography, and its structure was identified  as macelignan by instrumental analysis using 1d-nmr, 2d-nmr and ei-ms. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of macelignan against s. mutans was 3.9 microg/ml, which was much lower than those of other natural anticariogenic agents such as 15.6 microg/ml of sanguinarine, 250 microg/ml of eucalyptol, 500 microg/ml of menthol and thymol, and 1000 microg/ml of methyl salicylate. macelignan also possessed preferential activity against other oral microorganisms such as streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis,  lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei in the mic range of 2-31.3 microg/ml. in particular, the bactericidal test showed that macelignan, at a concentration of 20 microg/ml, completely inactivated s. mutans in 1 min. the specific activity and fast-effectiveness of macelignan against oral bacteria strongly suggest that it could be employed as a natural antibacterial agent in functional foods or oral care products.

TI  == susceptibilities of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to antibacterial peptides, {beta}-defensins and ll37, produced by human epithelial cells.
AB  == objectives: antimicrobial peptides are one of the factors involved in innate immunity. the susceptibility of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to the major antimicrobial peptides produced by epithelia was investigated. methods: synthetic antimicrobial peptides of human beta-defensin-1 (hbd1), hbd2, hbd3 and  ll37 (cap18) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against oral bacteria. they included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (20 strains), porphyromonas gingivalis (6), prevotella intermedia (7), fusobacterium nucleatum  (7), streptococcus mutans (5), streptococcus sobrinus (5), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus sanguis (4), streptococcus mitis (2) and lactobacillus casei (1). results: although the four peptides had bactericidal activity against all bacteria tested, the degree of antibacterial activity was variable against the different strains and species. the antibacterial activity of hbd1 was lower than that of the other peptides. among the bacteria tested in this study, f. nucleatum was highly susceptible to hbd3 and ll37, and s. mutans was highly susceptible to hbd3. we measured the zeta-potential, representing the net  charge of whole bacteria, to study the relationship between susceptibility to cationic peptide and the net charge of the bacteria. although we found some correlation in a. actinomycetemcomitans strains, we did not find a definite correlation with all the bacterial species. conclusions: these results indicate that beta-defensins and ll37 have versatile antibacterial activity against oral bacteria.

TI  == low ph-induced membrane fatty acid alterations in oral bacteria.
AB  == four oral bacterial strains, of which two are considered aciduric and two are considered acid-sensitive, were grown under glucose-limiting conditions in chemostats to determine whether their membrane fatty acid profiles were altered in response to environmental acidification. streptococcus gordonii dl1, as well as the aciduric strains s. salivarius 57.i, and lactobacillus casei 4646 increased the levels of mono-unsaturated membrane fatty acids. the non-aciduric strain s. sanguis 10904 did not alter its membrane composition in response to ph  values examined here. thus, in response to low ph, aciduric oral bacteria alter their membrane composition to contain increased levels of long-chained, mono-unsaturated fatty acids. this suggests that membrane fatty acid adaptation is a common mechanism utilized by bacteria to withstand environmental stress.

TI  == the acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  == the intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. in addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. the results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well  as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at ph 5.5 and 1% at ph 5.0, ph values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. at ph 5.0, members of the genus streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. the other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordinii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and sstreptococcus sanguis. analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.

TI  == correlations between bacterial levels in autologous subgingival plaque and saliva of adult sudanese.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess levels of oral bacteria and their correlations in paired samples of saliva and subgingival plaque in a population of adult sudanese. whole saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples from six probing sites of one tooth in each jaw were obtained from 56 sudanese adults (mean age 35.2+/-8.9 years). levels of 24 oral bacteria in the autologous saliva  and pooled plaque sample of each subject were assessed by dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. there were significantly ( p< or =0.01) higher percentages of subjects with > or =10(5) bacterial cells of prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, veillonella parvula, streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus salivarius, and leptotrichia buccalis and significantly ( p< or =0.01) lower percentages with treponema denticola in saliva than in subgingival plaque. the detection frequencies at > or =10(6) bacterial cells were significantly higher for selenomonas sputigena, s. anginosus, streptococcus sanguis, and s. salivarius and significantly lower for porphyromonas gingivalis in saliva than in subgingival plaque ( p< or =0.01). porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, s. sputigena, s. sanguis, and streptococcus mitis demonstrated significant ( p< or =0.05) positive correlations between their levels in plaque and saliva. this study indicates that the levels of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, s.  sanguis, and s. mitis correlate significantly in saliva and subgingival plaque and that higher accuracy of detection and assessment of the levels of these bacteria in the oral cavity may be achieved by concurrent sampling of saliva and  subgingival plaque.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacterial species associated with childhood caries.
AB  == although substantial epidemiologic evidence links streptococcus mutans to caries, the pathobiology of caries may involve more complex communities of bacterial species. molecular methods for bacterial identification and enumeration now make  it possible to more precisely study the microbiota associated with dental caries. the purpose of this study was to compare the bacteria found in early childhood caries (ecc) to those found in caries-free children by using molecular identification methods. cloning and sequencing of bacterial 16s ribosomal dnas from a healthy subject and a subject with ecc were used for identification of novel species or uncultivated phylotypes and species not previously associated with dental caries. ten novel phylotypes were identified. a number of species or  phylotypes that may play a role in health or disease were identified and warrant  further investigation. in addition, quantitative measurements for 23 previously known bacterial species or species groups were obtained by a reverse capture checkerboard assay for 30 subjects with caries and 30 healthy controls. significant differences were observed for nine species: s. sanguinis was associated with health and, in order of decreasing cell numbers, actinomyces gerencseriae, bifidobacterium, s. mutans, veillonella, s. salivarius, s. constellatus, s. parasanguinis, and lactobacillus fermentum were associated with  caries. these data suggest that a. gerencseriae and other actinomyces species may play an important role in caries initiation and that a novel bifidobacterium may  be a major pathogen in deep caries. further investigation could lead to the identification of targets for biological interventions in the caries process and  thereby contribute to improved prevention of and treatment for this significant public health problem.

TI  == alteration of the coadherence of candida albicans with oral bacteria by dietary sugars.
AB  == interactions between bacterial oral flora and candida albicans are important in denture plaque formation. this study therefore first aimed to quantify the coadherence of c. albicans and bacteria by the use of a bioluminescent adenosine  triphosphate (atp) assay based on the firefly luciferase-luciferin system. the second aim was to examine the effect of i) dietary sugars (used for preculture) and ii) enzymatic digestion of fungi on the coadherence. when yeast was preincubated in yeast nitrogen base medium (ynb) supplemented with 250 mm glucose, the yeast coadhered with all isolates of streptoccus mutans and streptococcus sanguis, and no significant coadhesion was observed with the isolates of streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus and actinomyces. however, when the yeast was precultured in ynb supplemented with 500 mm galactose, the yeast coadhered with s. salivarius and actinomyces, which was not observed when the yeast was grown in ynb with glucose. in addition, the coadherence of the yeast with the isolates of s. sanguis was significantly reduced. enzymatic digestion of yeast and a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay revealed that expression of at least two types of proteinaceous adhesins are involved in these phenomena.

TI  == inhibitory effects of moabs against a surface protein antigen in real-time adherence in vitro and recolonization in vivo of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == a surface protein antigen (pac) of streptococcus mutans, particularly the a-region of the molecule, has been reported to interact with salivary components  on the tooth surface. it might be a candidate antigen inducing the production of  antibodies against the adherence of s. mutans to the tooth surface. we investigated the effects of monoclonal antibodies (moabs) obtained by immunization of synthetic pac peptides that completely correspond to the amino acid sequence of part of the a-region. these moabs recognize several core b-cell  epitopes in the sequence. two (kh5 and sh2) of these antibodies reacted with both s. mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, but not with streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, porphyromonas gingivalis or lactobacillus casei. they clearly inhibited the real-time adherence of s. mutans to salivary components in  a biosensor. kh5, which showed a real-time inhibition (71%), also significantly prevented the recolonization of s. mutans on the tooth surface in rats. these results suggested that the core b-cell epitope (-y---l--y----) recognized by kh5  was the essential sequence in the antigenic epitopes of pac protein recognized specifically by the inhibitory antibody. therefore, the amino acid residues were  found to be important in the initial attachment of s. mutans to the tooth surface. these results provide for the mechanism of pac molecule in the initial attachment of s. mutans on the tooth surface and more effective designs for the removal of s. mutans and s. sobrinus from the oral cavity.

TI  == acid-regulated proteins induced by streptococcus mutans and other oral bacteria during acid shock.
AB  == our previous research has demonstrated that with the more aciduric oral bacteria, an acid shock to sub-lethal ph values results in the induction of an acid tolerance response that protects the cells at extremely low ph (ph 3.0-4.0) that  kills unadapted control cells maintained at ph 7.5 (oral microbiol immunol 1997:  12: 266-273). in this study, we were interested in comparing the protein profiles of acid-shocked and control cells of nine organisms from three acid-ogenic genera that could be categorized as strong, weak and non-acid responders in an attempt to identify proteins that could be classified as acid-regulated proteins and which may be important in the process of survival at very low ph. for this, log-phase cultures were rapidly acidified from ph 7.5 to 5.5 in the presence of [14c]-amino acids for varying periods up to 2 h, the period previously shown to be required for maximum induction of the acid response. the cells were extracted  for total protein and subjected to one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide chromatography with comparable control and acid-shocked protein profiles compared by scanning and computer analysis. of particular interest were the proteins in the acid-shocked cells that showed enhanced labeling (i.e., synthesis) over the control cells, since these were considered acid-regulated proteins of importance in ph homeostasis. streptococcus mutans lt11 generated the most rapid and complex pattern: a total of 36 acid-regulated proteins showing enhanced synthesis, with 25 appearing within the first 30 min of acid shock. the enhanced synthesis was transient with all proteins, with the exception of two with molecular weights of 50/49 and 33/32 kda. within the acid-regulated proteins were proteins having molecular weights comparable to the  heat shock proteins and the various subunits of the membrane h+/atpase. by comparison, the strong responder, lactobacillus casei 151, showed the enhanced formation of only nine proteins within the first 30 min of the acid shock, with a total of 11 acid-regulated proteins formed during the 2-h adaptation period with  enhanced synthesis transient for seven of these proteins. streptococcus salivarius at2 and streptococcus gordonii th12 had the formation of 6 and 8 proteins enhanced, while the weakly responding organisms, streptococcus sanguis atcc 10,556 and streptococcus oralis atcc 10,557, exhibited 8 and 6 such proteins, respectively. even non-responding strains unable to survive at very low ph, such as streptococcus sobrinus ch125/43, streptococcus mitis atcc 12,261 and  actinomyces naeslundii 301-13 showed the initial formation of 3-9 acid-regulated  proteins, but protein synthesis was not sustained over the entire adaptation period. clearly, the survival of oral bacteria at very low ph is related, not to  the total number of the acid-regulated proteins induced per se but to the formation of key proteins that function to augment normal ph homeostasis.

AB  == enolase activity in strains of oral streptococci previously has been found to be  inhibited by 50% (ki) by fluoride concentrations ranging from 50 to 300 microm or more in the presence of 0.5 to 1.0 mm inorganic phosphate ions. in this study, enolase was extracted and partly purified by a two-step process from five oral bacterial species and the effect of fluoride on the kinetics of enolase examined. the molecular weight of the putative enolase proteins was 46-48 kda. the vmax values ranged from 20 to 323 iu/mg and k(m) for glycerate-2-phosphate from 0.22 to 0.74 mm. enolase activity was inhibited competitively by fluoride, with ki values ranging from 16 to 54 microm in the presence of 5 mm inorganic phosphate ions. ki values for phosphate ranged from 2 to 8 mm. the enolase from streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556 was more sensitive to fluoride (ki = 16 +/- 2) than was enolase from streptococcus salivarius atcc 10575 (ki = 19 +/- 2) or streptococcus mutans nctc 10449 (ki = 40 +/- 4) and all three streptococcal strains were more sensitive to fluoride than either actinomyces naeslundii wvu 627 (ki = 46 +/- 6) or lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 7469 (ki = 54 +/- 6) enolases. the levels of fluoride found to inhibit the streptococcal enolases in this study are much lower than previously reported and are likely to be present in plaque, especially during acidogenesis, and could exert an anti-glycolytic effect.

AB  == the ability of oral lactobacilli to coaggregate with streptococci and actinomycetes was investigated. of the 7 species of lactobacilli studied, only two were capable of coaggregation and the coaggregation was restricted to streptococci. lactobacillus salivarius strains (2/4) coaggregated with streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus crista and tufted streptococcus sanguis ii strains. lactobacillus fermentum (2/3) coaggregated with s. gordonii and s. sanguis. the coaggregation between l. salivarius and s. salivarius, s. gordonii or tufted s. sanguis ii strains was mediated by a protein on the surface of the lactobacilli and was not inhibited by lactose. the coaggregation between l. fermentum and the streptococci was mediated by protein on the surface of the streptococci and was inhibited by lactose.

TI  == antibacterial activity of dentinal bonding agents.
AB  == the susceptibility of five bacterial species to seven dentinal bonding agents was examined in vitro. agar diffusion tests using filterpaper disks containing 10 microl each of conditioner, primer, or resin were performed on blood agar and mitis salivarius bacitracin agar. chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. after incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were measured. of  all the compounds tested, gluma cleanser and gluma etchant showed the strongest growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. no antibacterial effect was noted for prisma universal bond 2 and superlux universal bond 2 systems. the primers of gluma, denthesive, and scotchbond 2 displayed antibacterial activity that, in some cases, was comparable to that of 0.2% chlorhexidine. zones of inhibition were seen for the resin materials of scotchbond 2 and tripton with streptococcus  mutans, streptococcus sanguis and actinomyces viscosus. no inhibition was seen after these resins were cured, whereas the antibacterial effect of xr-bond on s sanguis and a viscosus was not affected by light curing.

TI  == multibacterial artificial plaque. a model for studying carious process.
AB  == a multibacterial artificial plaque was established in vitro on enamel slabs incubated in mixed culture of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans (serotype c), streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus casei and actinomyces viscosus. typical structure same as natural plaque was seen under microscope. the caries-like lesion produced under the plaque was observed in enamel sections. the lesion was similar in appearance to natural ones under optic and scanning electron microscopes. the acids produced in both culture media and artificial plaque were similar in composition and type to those produced in natural plaque after sugar attack. it is suggested that this kind of plaque model may be useful  in studying carious process in vitro, because it is easily controlled either by changing the composition of bacteria or by adding different kinds of nutrient in  the media. moreover, the results will be easier to explain than those produced in natural ones.

TI  == the influence of sucralose on bacterial metabolism.
AB  == sucralose (1',4',6' trideoxy-trichloro-galactosucrose) is a nontoxic, intensely sweet sucrose derivative that has been shown to be non-cariogenic in experimental animals. the purpose of this study was to determine whether certain oral bacteria could utilize sucralose. sucralose, as a sole carbon source, was unable to support growth of ten strains of oral bacteria and dental plaque. when sucrolose  was incorporated into a liquid medium containing glucose or sucrose, all organisms tested displayed similar ph falls, compared with controls. the incorporation of 126 mmol/l sucralose into glucose agar medium caused total inhibition of growth of streptococcus sobrinus 6715-17, streptococcus sanguis 10904, streptococcus sanguis challis, streptococcus salivarius, and actinomyces viscosus wvu627. sucralose had no effect on ips production. sucralose was not bound to, nor taken up by, cells. sucralose inhibited the formation of glucan and fructan polymers in proportion to the sucralose-to-enzyme ratio, but independent  of the sucrose concentration in the assay mixture. no radioactive polymer was formed from 14c-u-sucralose added to mixtures containing glucosyltransferase (gtf) or fructosyl-transferase (ftf). inhibition of gtf and ftf by sucralose was  removed following dialysis of the enzyme/sucralose mixture. these results show that sucralose was not utilized by the oral bacteria tested and that the inhibitory effect of sucralose on gtf and ftf was non-competitive and reversible. the results further support the concept that sucralose is non-cariogenic.

TI  == association of viridans group streptococci from pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis and upper genital tract infection.
AB  == the prevalence and role of viridans group streptococci in the female genital tract have not been well described. in this study of 482 pregnant women, 147 (30%) were culture positive for viridans group streptococci. of 392 women with predominant lactobacillus morphotypes by gram stain (normal), 110 (28%) were colonized with viridans group streptococci, compared with 37 (41%) of 90 women with bacterial vaginosis (bv) (p = 0.02). to determine whether any species were associated with bv, 177 consecutively isolated viridans group streptococci from the vagina were identified to the species level by using the facklam scheme. the  most frequently isolated species from the vagina was streptococcus intermedius (13%), followed by streptococcus acidominimus (6%), streptococcus constellatus (5%), streptococcus sanguis ii (4%), streptococcus mitis (2%), streptococcus salivarius (2%), streptococcus morbillorum (2%), streptococcus sanguis i (1%), streptococcus mutans (0.2%), and streptococcus uberis (0.2%) with an average of 1.2 species per woman. the distribution of the species among women with bv compared with normal women was not significantly different, with the exception of two species which were associated with bv: s. acidominimus (18% versus 3%, p less than 0.001) and s. morbillorum (6% versus 0.7%, p = 0.005). amniotic fluid and placenta cultures yielded 54 isolates: s. sanguis ii (13 isolates), s. acidominimus (9 isolates), s. intermedius (10 isolates), s. constellatus (3 isolates), s. mitis (4 isolates), s. sanguis i (4 isolates), s. morbillorum (5 isolates), s. mutans (2 isolates), s. uberis (1 isolate), mannitol-positive s. intermedius (1 isolate), and 2 isolates which were not classified. the distribution of species isolated from the upper genital tract was not a reflection of the distribution in the lower genital tract. dextran-producing species of viridans group streptococci may have a greater pathogenic potential in the placenta than the non-dextran-producing species.

TI  == degradation of starch and its hydrolytic products by oral bacteria.
AB  == selected strains of oral bacteria were analyzed for their ability to degrade wheat starch, maltose, maltotriose, and maltoheptaose. s. sanguis iuom-11m and jc804, s. mutans 6715, s. salivarius iuom-8, a. viscosus iuom-62, and a. naeslundii atcc 12104 degraded all four substrates. s. mutans nctc 10449 degraded starch, maltose, and maltotriose, while a. viscosus atcc 15987 degraded starch and maltose, and s. sanguis ss34 degraded only maltose. l. casei iuom-14 did not  degrade any of the substrates. analysis of starch degradation products from s. sanguis iuom-11m and a. viscosus iuom-62 demonstrated oligosaccharides, maltose,  and trace amounts of glucose for the former and oligosaccharides, maltotriose, and maltose for the latter. s. sanguis iuom-11m alpha-glucosidase (ec 3.2.1.20) demonstrated a ph optimum of 6.5 and greatly enhanced activity from maltose-cultured cells as compared with cells cultured in glucose or fructose. the presence of fructose in the growth medium prevented this enhancement of activity by maltose. maltose inhibited sucrose-dependent synthesis of s. sanguis  iuom-11m insoluble polysaccharide and both primer-dependent and primer-independent synthesis of soluble polysaccharide. maltoheptaose inhibited primer-dependent but not primer-independent soluble polysaccharide synthesis. several oral bacteria have the ability to hydrolyze starch and to degrade further the products to acidogenic substrates. these products may also inhibit sucrose-dependent synthesis of polysaccharides, which enhances the production of  the acidogenic substrate fructose. the results add further support to the growing body of evidence suggesting that caries-promoting properties of starch may be expressed only when starch is present in diets containing sucrose.

TI  == [bacteriological investigation of the cariogenic effects of sugar alcohols and sucrose].
AB  == considerable evidence indicates that the disaccharide, sucrose is probably the major dietary factor in dental caries formation and much subsequent research has  gone into the search for another sweetener to replace sucrose. currently, there is much interest in the development of new sweeteners and the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols. the present study aimed to examine the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols (xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol) and sucrose on growth  pattern and acid production of s. mutans, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. faecalis, s. viridans, l. casei and l. acidophilus in vitro by using photo electrical colorimeter and ph meter. in conclusion the results in this study showed that out of sugar alcohols, xylitol is the only compound which, depending  on its concentration, significantly did not affect the growth and acid production of all tested micro organisms.

TI  == acid tolerance, proton permeabilities, and membrane atpases of oral streptococci.
AB  == differences in acid tolerance among representative oral streptococci were found to be related more closely to the dynamic permeabilities of the bacteria to protons than to differences in the sensitivities of cell membranes to gross damage caused by environmental acidification. for streptococcus mutans gs-5, streptococcus sanguis nctc 10904, and streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419, gross  membrane damage, indicated by the release of magnesium from whole cells, occurred at ph values below about 4 and was rapid and extensive at ph values of about 3 or less. a more aciduric, lactic acid bacterium, lactobacillus casei atcc 4646, was  more resistant to environmental acidification, and gross membrane damage was evident only at ph values below 3. assessments of the movements of protons into s. mutans cells after an acid pulse at various ph values indicated that permeability to protons was minimal at a ph value of about 5, at which the average half time for ph equilibration across the cell membrane was about 12 min. the corresponding values for the less aciduric organism s. sanguis were ph 7 and  8.2 min, and the values for the intermediate organism s. salivarius were ph 6 and 6.6 min. the atpase inhibitor dicyclohexylcarbodiimide acted to increase markedly the permeability of each organism to protons, and this action indicated that permeability involved not only the passive inflow of protons but also active outflow through the proton-translocating membrane atpase. membranes were isolated from each of the bacteria, and ph profiles for atpase activities indicated ph optima of about 7.5, 7.0, 6.0, and 5.0 for s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. mutans,  and l. casei, respectively. thus, the ph profiles for the enzymes reflected the acid tolerances of the bacteria and the permeabilities of whole cells to protons.

TI  == effect of monoclonal antibodies against lipoteichoic acid from the oral bacterium streptococcus mutans on its adhesion and plaque-accumulation in vitro.
AB  == five monoclonal antibodies directed against streptococcus mutans strain jbp lipoteichoic acid (lta) were characterized. they were all similarly reactive with the immunizing lta-containing extract, with intact strep. mutans jbp cells and with lta purified from lactobacillus casei. immobilized anti-lta antibodies removes lta from lta-containing extracts. the binding of antibodies to lta was inhibited by the aqueous extract but not by the organic extract of de-acylated lta, indicating reactivity with the polyglycerol-phosphate portion of the molecule. antibodies were reactive with all serotypes of strep. mutans, as well as with strains of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis and l. casei,  but not with lta-negative species streptococcus mitis or actinomyces viscosus. anti-lta antibodies at doses of 0.3 or 3.0 micrograms/ml, had no effect on the adherence of strep. mutans jbp to experimental salivary pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite, but enhanced adherence 150-300 per cent at 30 micrograms/ml. there was no effect of anti-lta antibodies in a chemostat model which measured sucrose-dependent plaque accumulation by strep. mutans. the results argue against a major role for lta in strep. mutans adherence or plaque accumulation in vitro.

TI  == ph change in artificial dental plaque formed by glucosyltransferase and some oral bacteria during batch and continuous culture.
AB  == streptococcus mutans alone or cell-free glucosyltransferase (g-tase)-together with either streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces viscosus, or lactobacillus casei cells-formed artificial dental plaque that firmly adhered to glass electrodes in a continuous culture system containing sucrose. the ph in these artificial plaque samples decreased more than did that of the surrounding medium. in the absence of gtase, the bacteria other than s. mutans did not form firmly-adhering plaque on glass electrodes. the ph of the plaque formed with gtase alone did not show the ph decrease seen when the plaque  contained bacteria, but, because it catalyzed the synthesis of glucan, it is suggested that the glucan acts as a diffusion barrier to retard acid loss from plaque containing acid-producing bacteria.

AB  == sucrose-related microbial population shifts were evaluated at 6 oral sites in 22  volunteers, who consumed high-sucrose diets for 21 days followed by low-sucrose diets for 21 days. culturing was performed at 0, 12, 21, 33 and 42 days of the 6-week experiment. over 50,000 microbial isolates were characterized and analysed. analysis of initial cultures showed the following site-specific microbial characteristics of the 6 sites evaluated: (1) molar fissures harboured  higher levels of neisseria species and showed the highest facultative-to-anaerobic ratio; (2) molar fissures and cervical buccal sites showed high streptococcus sanguis levels and total gram-positive cocci and fewer  gram-negative bacilli; (3) the tongue and saliva gave high concentrations of streptococcus salivarius and veillonella sp. sucrose intake was positively related to concentrations of yeasts and streptococcus mutans in the molar fissures; actinomyces viscosus in the mandibular approximal site; strep. mutans,  veillonella sp. and lactobacillus sp. in the maxillary approximal site and strep. salivarius on the tongue and in saliva. sucrose intake was negatively related to  concentrations of neisseria sp. on the tongue and total gram-positive bacilli in  saliva. a definite ecological effect of sucrose on the oral microflora was confirmed. the high inter-subject and site variations of target bacteria and the  generally low magnitude of shifts, however, discourage implementation of microbiological criteria in dietary assessments.

TI  == isolation of a novel protein involved in the transport of fructose by an inducible phosphoenolpyruvate fructose phosphotransferase system in streptococcus mutans.
AB  == fructose transport in streptococcus mutans lg-1 is mediated by at least two distinct phosphoenolpyruvate fructose phosphotransferase systems. one system is constitutive and consists of membrane components enzyme ii as well as enzyme i and heat-stable protein. the other system is inducible and requires, in addition  to enzyme i and heat-stable protein, a soluble substrate-specific protein for catalytic activity. this protein factor, designated iiifru, was purified by deae-cellulose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, molecular sieving  on sephadex g-75, and preparative electrophoresis. the purified preparation showed only one protein band, with a molecular weight of 12,600, on sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, on gel electrophoresis with the discontinuous buffer tris-glycine, and after electrofocusing in gel (pi  congruent to 3.7). the molecular weight of the native protein determined by gel filtration at 4 degrees c was 51,000. immunodiffusion experiments performed with  immunoglobulins prepared against the purified iiifru from s. mutans lg-1 suggested that other s. mutans strains possessed a iiifru. no precipitin bands, however, were detected with extracts from s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. lactis, s. faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, lactobacillus casei, and escherichia coli.

AB  == the transport of lactose in streptococcus mutans is mediated via an inducible phosphoenolpyruvate-lactose phosphotransferase system. this system requires for catalytic activity a membrane fraction (enzyme ii), two general proteins called enzyme i and hpr, and a soluble specific protein termed factor iiilac. this protein factor was purified from s. mutans atcc 27352 by chromatographies on deae-cellulose, hydroxylapatite, ultrogel aca 34, and phosphocellulose. the purified protein migrated as a single band with a molecular weight of 10,000 on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and  urea. the molecular weight calculated from the amino acid composition was 10,541. gel filtration of the native protein gave a molecular weight of 41,500. its isoelectric point was ca. 4.70. a specific antiserum was prepared against purified factor iiilac. immunodiffusion experiments revealed that only cellular extracts from lactose-grown cells contained factor iiilac. a cross-reaction was observed with all of the s. mutans strains tested as well as with streptococcus sanguis 10556, streptococcus lactis 11454, and staphylococcus aureus 6538. no precipitin band was observed with extracts of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, and bacillus subtilis.

TI  == sucrase and maltase activities in supragingival dental plaque in humans of streptococcal, actinomyces and lactobacilli species.
AB  == 20 reference strains and 72 isolated strains from dental plaque of streptococci,  actinomyces, and lactobacilli species were examined for sucrase and maltase activities. the type of sucrase in the different strains was determined by use of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, acarbose. the enzyme activities were determined  as formation of monosaccharide, and quantitated spectrophotometrically. although  variations occurred in enzyme activities between reference and isolated strains,  the same general pattern was noticed. strains of streptococcus mutans and s. salivarius showed regularly the highest sucrase activities, followed by strains of actinomyces viscosus and a. naeslundii. most lactobacilli belonged to the bacteria with low sucrase activity like s. sanguis and s. mitior. in some lactobacilli strains, however, a high sucrase activity was observed. the level of sucrase activity in s. mutans strains was dependent on biotype/serotype, as strains of biotype v/serotype e showed high activities, biotypes i and iv corresponding to serotypes c, f, and d showed intermediate activity, and biotype  iii/serotype a always showed low activity. in most of the strains the sucrases were composed of enzymes with specificity against both alpha-glucosidic linkage and beta-fructosidic linkage of the sucrose molecule, but in varying ratios. in all species, exept s. sanguis and s. mitior, lower maltase than sucrase activity  was observed, but even in the two species mentioned the maltase activities were relatively low. on the basis of observations of selected reference strains in every species examined both sucrases and maltases are to some extent inducible.

TI  == oral flora of children with "nursing bottle caries".
AB  == s. mutans averaged about 60% of the total cultivable flora of dental plaque obtained from caries lesions, white spot margins of these lesions, or clinically-sound areas of upper anterior teeth, and averaged about 27% in plaque  from mostly clinically-sound areas of posterior teeth of six children with nursing bottle caries; its concentrations in saliva averaged about 10% of the total cultivable flora. nearly all of 107 isolated s. mutans strains belonged to  the serotype group c/e/f. the proportion of s. sanguis, in contrast to those of s. mutans, were very low in plaque from upper anterior teeth and higher in plaque from posterior teeth. the proportions of s. salivarius in saliva were unusually low, and this organism was not detected in the saliva of most subjects. lactobacilli were found in nearly all plaque samples; plaque and carious material from cavities contained higher levels than plaque associated with white spots or  clinically-sound tooth surfaces. the findings provide further support for the role of s. mutans in the initiation of human dental caries. in the case of lactobacilli, they support other evidence suggesting only the limited involvement of these organisms in the initiation of caries lesions, but a more extensive role in their progression. in addition, they clearly illustrate the marked effect of diet on the dental plaque flora.

TI  == sucrose-induced ecological response of experimental dental plaques from caries-free and caries-susceptible human volunteers.
AB  == microbial succession, experimental cariogenicity, and sucrose metabolism were examined in dental plaques which developed on sterile bovine enamel inserts in acrylic palatal appliances. the appliances were worn for a period of 14 days by 10 caries-free and 10 caries-susceptible human volunteers. three of six enamel inserts on each appliance were exposed extraorally to 10% sucrose in 0.85% saline six times a day, and three were exposed simultaneously to 0.85% saline as a control environment. the responses of the plaques to the high-sucrose environment in both caries status populations were compared. in all plaques, exposure to 10%  sucrose stimulated the succession of veillonella spp., lactobacillus spp., streptococcus salivarius, and, to a lesser extent, streptococcus mutans and a decline in levels of streptococcus sanguis, neisseria spp., and gram-negative anaerobic rods. plaques from caries-free mouths, in contrast to those from caries-susceptible mouths, harbored higher levels of veillonella spp., gram-negative anaerobic rods, and neisseria spp. and lower levels of lactobacillus spp. sucrose-exposed plaques from caries-free mouths also induced less enamel microhardness changes and formed less lactic acid from [14c]sucrose during a 60-min incubation at 37 degrees c than did comparable plaques from caries-susceptible mouths. the experiments revealed consistent differences in the ecological response to a cariogenic substrate environment in plaques from the two populations, with plaques from caries-free subjects exhibiting less cariogenic potential than those from caries-susceptible subjects.

AB  == soluble extracellular antigens (esa) were prepared from the culture supernatant of exponential growing cells of streptococcus sanguis omz 9 by a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography on a bio-gel p6 column. soluble cell wall antigens (wea) were obtained from the bacterial pellet by extraction with 1 m phosphate buffer (ph 6). antisera against whole cells of s. sanguis and  s. mutans of different serotypes, 10% trichloroacetic extracts of bacterial cell  walls, dextran, esa, and wea were prepared by injecting the different antigens several times in rabbits. esa and wea were prepared from a representative strain  of bratthall's seven serological groups, lactobacillus salivarius, and actinomyces viscosus. all sera showed various agglutinin titers against heat-killed cells, and titers were generally higher with homologous cells. the comparison of the different antigens using agar gel diffusion and immunoelectrophoresis showed the presence of extracellular common antigens in both esa and wea between the different strains. absorption of anti-esa sera with  wea, and anti-wea sera with esa, showed the existence of a specific antigen common to all bacteria in each fraction. enzymatic treatment of the antigen before immunodiffusion demonstrated the protein nature of the two antigens present in esa and wea.

TI  == role of bacterial interactions in the colonization of oral surfaces of actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == the effects of several microbial residents of human oral cavities on the attachment of actinomyces viscosus t14v to tooth surfaces were assessed by using  the saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha) in vitro system. attachment to sha by a. viscosus t14v was not inhibited in the presence of streptococcus mutans gs5, either in the presence or absence of sucrose. precoating sha beads with s. mutans in the presence of sucrose also did not retard strain t14v attachment. however, the presence of streptococcus sanguis m5 during strain t14v attachment markedly inhibited the interaction of a. viscosus t14v with sha, whereas another s. sanguis strain, strain g9b, produced relatively weak inhibition. the inhibitory effect of s. sanguis m5 appeared to result from the direct interaction of this organism with a. viscosus t14v. conversely, the presence of strain t14v markedly  increased the attachment of s. sanguis m5 to sha while partially inhibiting the attachment of s. sanguis g9b. moreover, sha beads precoated with a. viscosus t14v bound much higher levels of s. sanguis m5 relative to uncoated sha, whereas s. sanguis g9b attachment was only weakly inhibited. it was also observed that sha beads precoated with either s. sanguis m5 or g9b inhibited subsequent attachment  by strain t14v. these results suggest the possibility that the attachment sites for both s. sanguis strains partially overlap those for a. viscosus t14v. streptococcus mitis weakly inhibited attachment of strain t14v to sha, and both streptococcus salivarius and lactobacillus casei had little effect on attachment. in addition, both a radioisotope attachment assay and fluorescent microscopy demonstrated no significant attachment of a. viscosus t14v to human epithelial cells.

TI  == binding of streptococcal antigens to muscle tissue in vitro.
AB  == antigens extracted from cells of streptococcus pyogenes t6 and streptococcus mutans strains aht, bht, 10449, omz175, and k1r adsorbed to the sarcolemmal sheath of cardiac muscle cells in vitro. similar preparations from s. salivarius, s. sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, and lactobacillus casei had weak or negligible tissue-binding activity. tissue-bound bacterial antigens were detected with homologous rabbit antisera with both indirect immunofluorescence tests and an indirect radioimmunoassay. serological cross-reactivity was observed between the  tissue-binding factors of s. pyogenes and s. mutans cells but not between the bacteria and muscle tissue. in a comparative study of extraction procedures, the  greatest yield of tissue-binding factors was obtained from group a streptococci by cell disruption in buffer at 4 degrees c. hot aqueous phenol and hot water extracts were inactive. antibodies specific for the tissue-binding factor(s) were readily adsorbed from rabbit anti-s. pyogenes serum by a preparation of isolated  cytoplasmic membranes but not by a suspension of cell wall fragments. the heart-binding component of s. pyogenes cell extracts was inactivated by protease  digestion and heat treatment and to a lesser extent by periodic acid oxidation. the capacity of heart cell components to adsorb streptococcal antigens was reduced by protease treatment but not by the action of neuraminidase, hyaluronidase, organic solvents, or detergents.

TI  == bacterial and strain specificities in opsonization, phagocytosis and killing of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == opsonization of streptococcus mutans, followed by phagocytosis and killing by polymorphonuclear leucocytes has been postulated as an effector mechanism in protection against dental caries. opsonization was studied by using sera from monkeys immunized with killed strep. mutans (sero-type c) and compared with sera  from sham-immunized monkeys. antibodies to strep. mutans (sero-type c) induced maximal phagocytosis and killing of serotypes c and e, and this was significantly greater than with serotypes a and d; there was no significant phagocytosis or killing of serotype b. there was little or no opsonization with actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus casei, strep, sanguis and strep. salivarius. the exception was strep. cht which showed significant phagocytosis and killing. the results suggest that immunization with the serotype c strain of strep. mutans might offer protection against four of the five common serotypes of this organism.

TI  == dental caries induction in experimental animals by clinical strains of streptococcus mutans isolated from japanese children.
AB  == oral implantation and the cariogenic activity of clinical strains of streptococcus mutans which had been isolated from japanese children and labeled with streptomycin-resistance were examined in specific pathogen-free sprague-dawley rats. all the seven strains tested were easily implanted and persisted during the experimental period. extensive carious lesions were produced in rats inoculated with clinical strains of s. mutans belonging to serotypes c, d, e, and f, and maintained on caries-inducing diet no. 2000. noninfected rats did not develop dental caries when fed diet no. 2000. type d s. mutans preferentially induced smooth surface caries in the rats. strains of other serotypes primarily developed caries of pit and fissure origin. caries also developed in rats inoculated with reference s. mutans strains bhtr and fair (type b) that had been maintained in the laboratories for many years. however, the cariogenicity of the laboratory strains was found to have decreased markedly. all three s. sanguis strains could be implanted, but only one strain induced definite fissure caries. two s. salivarius strains could not be implanted well in the rats and therefore they were not cariogenic. four different species of lactobacilli also failed to induce dental caries in rats subjected to similar caries test regimen on diet no. 200. s. mutans strain mt6r (type c) also induce caries in golden hamsters and icr mice, but of variable degrees.

TI  == binding of lectins to streptococcus mutans cells and type-specific polysaccharides, and effect on adherence.
AB  == the lectin concanavalin a (con a) agglutinated the cells of 13 of 15 strains of the seven serotypes of streptococcus mutans in an 18-h incubation period. strains of types a, d, f, and g agglutinated within 2 h. strains of a, d, and f were also agglutinated in 2 h by the castor bean lectin rca. s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s.  bovis, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, and lactobacillus plantarum were agglutinated within 2 h. the s. mutans type f polysaccharide was precipitated by  con a. the a, b, c, d, and e polysaccharides were not precipitated. glucan from d and e strains of s. mutans and dextran t2000 were also precipitated by con a. d-glucose inhibited the agglutination of type f cells by con a and the agglutination of type d cells by d-galactose. the quantity of [acetyl-3h]con a bound was not proportional to the degree of agglutination. cells grown in sucrose medium bound more con a than those grown in glucose medium. after treatment with  dextranase, the sucrose-grown cells bound two- to fourfold more con a. the binding of con a to the type-specific polysaccharide or to teichoic acid could not be determined by the use of specific antibody due to the binding of con a to  the antibody globulin on the cell surface. con a bound to s. mutans cells did not inhibit the activity of cell-bound glucosyltransferase, glucan synthesis, and in  vitro adherence. bound con a also did not inhibit the ability of heat-treated cells to bind glucosyltransferase, synthesize glucan, and produce in vitro adherence.

TI  == survival of bacteria from human dental plaque under various transport conditions.
AB  == the effects of transport media, temperature, and anaerobiosis on the survival of  bacteria from human supragingival dental plaque were studied. individual samples  were obtained by passing sterile, unwaxed dental floss through the interproximal  spaces. the plaque-bearing portion of floss was immediately placed in vials containing reduced transport fluid, viability-preserving microbistatic medium, or reduced salt solution transport fluid. plaque samples were dispersed by ultrasonic oscillation, serially diluted, and plated in duplicate on mm10-sucrose-blood agar, mitis salivarius bacitracin agar, and rogosa tomato juice agar. initial viable counts (time 0) were compared with viable count determinations after 48- and 72-h storage. quantitative recovery (>30%) of various groups of oral bacteria was accomplished from both reduced transport fluid and viability-preserving microbistatic medium after 48- and 72-h storage. storage of dental plaque in reduced salt solution proved unsatisfactory for most  bacteria (less than 10% survival). since growth of some bacteria may occur in viability-preserving microbistatic medium and the charcoal present interferes with colonly enumeration on low-dilution plates, we found reduced transport fluid to be the most suitable medium for transport and recovery of bacteria from supragingival dental plaque. subzero storage (-196 and -40 degrees c) did not enhance the survival of bacteria from dental plaque; storage at moderate (5 and 20 degrees c) temperatures gave better recovery of viable bacteria. survival after anaerobic or aerobic storage was comparable for total colony-forming units; however, anaerobic storage enhanced survival of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus. since these organisms are specifically associated with dental caries, anaerobic techniques are preferred for caries activity testing of plaque.

TI  == microbial characterization of an experimental cariogenic plaque in man.
AB  == experimentally induced plaque seemed to originate by direct contact inoculation from the vestibular mucosa and saliva. during the next seven days, this plaque developed its own characteristics. populations of streptococcus mutans usually less than 2% of total streptococci population in plaques that were less than three days old, increased between days 3 and 7. proportions of s sanguis, high in early samples, decreased after day 3. populations of s salivarius, which usually  outnumbered other streptococci, fluctuated widely through day 3, and then increased in proportion in subjects who were more productive of experimental caries, but decreased in subjects who were less productive. proportions of plaque flora comprising lactobacilli paralleled those of s salivarius.

TI  == acid production from lycasin, maltitol, sorbitol and xylitol by oral streptococci and lactobacilli.
AB  == the acid production from maltitol was compared with the acid production from hydrogenated starch hydrolysate (lycasin), sorbitol and xylitol by a number of oral strains and reference strains of streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. mitior, s. milleri, s. faecalis, s. faecium, s. avium, lactobacillus casei and l. salivarius. the polyols were added to a final concentration of 1.0% to two different basal media. incubation was performed at 37 degrees c for 7 days after which the ph was recorded. maltitol was fermented only by the lactobacilli (about two thirds of the strains). lycasin was fermented by all strains of s. faecalis, more than 90% of the lactobacilli, about half of the s. sanguis strains, about one third of the s. mutans strains, and by a few other streptococcal strains. acid production from sorbitol was observed among more than 80% of the s. mutans strains and the s. faecalis strains and most of the lactobacilli strains. sorbitol-fermenting strains of s. sanguis and of s. mitior, all isolated from sorbitol-consumers, were observed. no other sorbitol-fermenting streptococci were found. only the reference strains l. salivarius subsp. salivarius atcc 11741 and s. avium atcc 14025 fermented xylitol.

TI  == evaluation of human oral organisms and pathogenic streptococcus for production of iga protease.
AB  == iga protease is a proteolytic enzyme found in whole human saliva and in dental plaque that cleaves both secretory and myeloma iga of human origin to yield intact fabalpha and fcalpha fragments. to determine which bacteria are capable of producing this enzyme, we have examined a variety of strains normally found in the human oral cavity and a number of streptococci of known lancefield group serotype. streptococci of groups a, b, c, d, f, g, h, m, and n, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus faecalis, veillonella, lactobacillus, actinomyces, propionibacterium, bacteroides, and fusobacterium were grown in liquid medium, and fluids were examined for iga protease activity. only s. sanguis and clinically isolated group h streptococci elaborated iga protease under the culture conditions used. negative strains could not be stimulated to produce the  enzyme when cultured in the presence of secretory iga. among the natural oral bacteria, capacity to produce iga protease is restricted to certain species of streptococcus, notably those of the group h serotype. since secretory immunity is mediated by the iga class of antibody, the presence of this enzyme at mucosal surfaces could modify the secretory immune function.

TI  == mutanolysin, bacteriolytic agent for cariogenic streptococci: partial purification and properties.
AB  == mutanolysin partially purified from the culture filtrate of streptomyces globisporus 1829 consists of two main lytic enzymes with an isoelectric point near ph 8.5 and 10, respectively, and proteolytic enzyme is associated with the latter lytic enzyme. mutanolysin exhibited maximal lytic activity at 60 c in the  ph range 6.5 to 7.0 and was stable at 50 c in the acid range. n-bromosuccinimide  caused complete inhibition of lytic activity at 1 mm, whereas calcium and magnesium ions at the same concentration caused activation. mutanolysin had lytic or bactericidal activity against the living cells of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces viscosus, which are considered to be etiologic agents of dental caries, but had no activity against s. aureus and all gram-negative strains tested. the lytic activity was well retained in human saliva. digestion of the cell walls of s. mutans bht by mutanolysin was accompanied by the liberation of free amino groups and reducing sugars. mutanolysin may be expected to be a useful agent for dental caries control.

TI  == ecology of human oral lactobacilli.
AB  == lactobacilli were found in saliva, on teeth, and on the dorsum of the tongue, the vestibular mucosa, and the hard palate in humans. their proportions in saliva, expressed as percentage of the anaerobically cultivable flora, were 10- to 100-fold higher than those on the tooth surface, but were comparable to those on  the epithelial surfaces. the adherence of lactobacillus casei and l. fermenti to  oral surfaces was compared with that of streptomycin-labeled streptococcus sanguis and s. salivarius by using in vitro-cultivated cells. the affinity of both lactobacillus species for the tooth surface was very low compared with that  of s. sanguis but was somewhat higher than that of s. salivarius. the lactobacilli and both streptococcus species adhered to a similar extent to the dorsum of the tongue, whereas the affinity of the lactobacilli and s. salivarius  for the vestibular mucosa was about one-half of that of s. sanguis. the results suggest that the affinity of lactobacilli for oral surfaces significantly influences their proportional distribution in the mouth. the relatively low affinity of lactobacilli for the tooth surface suggests that their recognized association with carious lesions and mechanical appliances under certain conditions may be due primarily to mechanical retention rather than unique growth conditions.
