TI  == comparison of maldi tof with conventional identification of clinically relevant bacteria.
AB  == background: a completely new approach to diagnose microbial agents at least one day earlier based on mass spectrometric analysis becomes possible in the microbiology laboratory: maldi tof: matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight. comparison between results of the new procedure with those obtained by conventional testing is mandatory. methods: 204 clinical isolates grown on agar plates were analysed both, by the maldi tof bruker microflex apparatus and by conventional identification using the vitek ii and api systems,  both from biomerieux. results: of the identified isolates, 72 were gram-positive  and 130 gram-negative; 2 were yeasts (candida). concordance was seen with 61/72 (85%) of the gram-positive bacteria and with 115/130 (88%) of the gram-negative bacteria. in 27 samples (13.2%), a discrepancy of the species and/or genus was obvious. the discrepancy appeared with 16 gram-negative (12.2%) and with 11 gram-positive germs (15.3%, n.s.). in the latter group, 6 samples showed discordance with streptococcus pneumoniae (maldi) and streptococcus mitis/oralis  (conventional identification) constellation. among gram-negative samples, most differences occurred on the species level only, e.g. enterobacter cloacae versus  enterobacter kobei. in 5 cases, discordance was major and appeared on the genus level: enterobacter/raoultella, streptococcus/gemella, pseumdomonas/burkholderia, microbacter/sphingomonas and candida/cryptococcus. the most outstanding difference was microbacterium arborescens (maldi tof) and sphingomonas paucimobilis (conventional). molecular biological identification of two streptococcus mitis group bacteria confirmed the erroneous diagnosis by maldi tof of streptococcus pneumoniae. conclusion: good comparability between maldi tof analysis and conventional identification procedures (86.8%) but special caution is needed when identifying streptococcal species.

TI  == clostridium perfringens liver abscess after pancreatic resection.
AB  == background: liver abscess is a rare complication after pancreatectomy. clostridium perfingens is a rare cause of intrahepatic infections. case report: a 65-year-old woman with pancreatic cancer underwent explorative laparotomy, during which encasement of the hepatic artery by the tumor was found. neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy with capecitabine was started, which caused tumor regression, and duodenopancreatectomy was performed. the portal vein was occluded and infiltrated by cancer and therefore was resected and not reconstructed. after a slow recovery, the patient developed hemorrhage at the gastrojejunal anastomosis, which was controlled by fibrin injection. within a few days, she presented with signs of sepsis, and blood cultures yielded clostridium perfringens, streptococcus oralis, staphylococcus aureus, and candida albicans. the source of  the sepsis proved to be a 9-cm liver abscess, which was drained; cultures grew c. perfringens, hafnia alvei, and enterobacter cloacae. despite antibiotic treatment, the patient died from sepsis and multiorgan failure 27 days after pancreatic surgery. conclusion: such rare infections can follow pancreatic resection with neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. clostridium perfringens-associated  liver abscess maintains a high mortality rate.

TI  == gram-positive mera gene in gram-negative oral and urine bacteria.
AB  == clinical mercury resistant (hg(r)) gram-negative bacteria carrying gram-positive  mercury reductase (mera)-like genes were characterized using dna-dna hybridization, pcr and sequencing. a pcr assay was developed which discriminated  between the mera genes related to staphylococcus and those related to the bacillus/streptococcus mera genes by the difference in size of the pcr product. dna sequence analysis correlated with the pcr assay. the mera genes from acinetobacter junii, enterobacter cloacae and escherichia coli were sequenced and shared 98-99% identical nucleotide (nt) and 99.6-100% amino acid identity with the staphylococcus aureus mera protein. a fourth mera gene, from pantoeae agglomerans, was partially sequenced (60%) and had 99% identical nt and 100% amino acid identity with the streptococcus oralis mera protein. all the hg(r) gram-negative bacteria transferred their gram-positive mera genes to a gram-positive enterococcus faecalis recipient with the resulting transconjugants  expressing mercury resistance. these gram-positive mera genes join gram-positive  tetracycline resistance and gram-positive macrolide resistance genes in their association with mobile elements which are able to transfer and express in gram-negative bacteria.
