TI  - Microbiological characterization in children with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - The objective of this study was to characterize the subgingival microbiota of African-American children with Localized Aggressive Periodontitis (LAP). Fifty-one children were included. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from diseased (DD) and healthy sites (DH) in LAP and from healthy sites in HS and HC and analyzed by 16S rRNA-based microarrays. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) was the only species found to be both more prevalent (OR = 8.3, p = 0.0025) and abundant (p < 0.01) in DD. Filifactor alocis (Fa) was also found to be more prevalent in DD (OR 2.31, CI 1.06-5.01, p = 0.03). Most prevalent species in healthy sites were Selenomonas spp, Veillonella spp, Streptococcus spp, Bergeyella sp, and Kingella oralis. Overall, Streptococcus spp, Campylobacter gracilis, Capnocytophaga granulosa, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and Lautropia mirabilis were most abundant in healthy children, while Aa, Fa, Tannerella sp, Solobacterium moorei, Parvimonas micra, and Capnocytophaga sp were most abundant in LAP. Based on a comprehensive analysis with 16S rRNA-based microarrays, Aa was strongly associated and site-specific in LAP. In contrast, other species were found to be associated with healthy sites and individuals (ClinicalTrials.gov number CT01330719). ABBREVIATIONS: healthy site in healthy sibling (HS); healthy site in healthy control child (HC).
TI  - Mechanical non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis: a single-blinded randomized longitudinal clinical study. II. Microbiological results.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peri-implantitis is common in patients with dental implants. We performed a single-blinded longitudinal randomized study to assess the effects of mechanical debridement on the peri-implant microbiota in peri-implantitis lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An expanded checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization assay encompassing 79 different microorganisms was used to study bacterial counts before and during 6 months following mechanical treatment of peri-implantitis in 17 cases treated with curettes and 14 cases treated with an ultrasonic device. Statistics included non-parametric tests and GLM multivariate analysis with p<0001 indicating significance and 80% power. RESULTS: At selected implant test sites, the most prevalent bacteria were: Fusobacterium nucleatum sp., Staphylococci sp., Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Helicobacter pylori, and Tannerella forsythia. 30 min. after treatment with curettes, A. actinomycetemcomitans (serotype a), Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus anginosus, and Veillonella parvula were found at lower counts (p<0.001). No such differences were found for implants treated with the ultrasonic device. Inconsistent changes occurred following the first week. No microbiological differences between baseline and 6-month samples were found for any species or between treatment study methods in peri-implantitis. CONCLUSIONS: Both methods failed to eliminate or reduce bacterial counts in peri-implantitis. No group differences were found in the ability to reduce the microbiota in peri-implantitis.
TI  - Central role of the early colonizer Veillonella sp. in establishing multispecies  biofilm communities with initial, middle, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  - Human dental biofilm communities comprise several species, which can interact cooperatively or competitively. Bacterial interactions influence biofilm formation, metabolic changes, and physiological function of the community. Lactic acid, a common metabolite of oral bacteria, was measured in the flow cell effluent of one-, two- and three-species communities growing on saliva as the sole nutritional source. We investigated single-species and multispecies colonization by using known initial, early, middle, and late colonizers of enamel. Fluorescent-antibody staining and image analysis were used to quantify the biomass in saliva-fed flow cells. Of six species tested, only the initial colonizer Actinomyces oris exhibited significant growth. The initial colonizer Streptococcus oralis produced lactic acid but showed no significant growth. The early colonizer Veillonella sp. utilized lactic acid in two- and three-species biofilm communities. The biovolumes of all two-species biofilms increased when Veillonella sp. was present as one of the partners, indicating that this early colonizer promotes mutualistic community development. All three-species combinations exhibited enhanced growth except one, i.e., A. oris, Veillonella sp., and the middle colonizer Porphyromonas gingivalis, indicating specificity among three-species communities. Further specificity was seen when Fusobacterium nucleatum (a middle colonizer), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a late colonizer), and P. gingivalis did not grow with S. oralis in two-species biofilms, but inclusion of Veillonella sp. resulted in growth of all three-species combinations. We propose that commensal veillonellae use lactic acid for growth in saliva and that they communicate metabolically with initial, early, middle, and late colonizers to establish multispecies communities on enamel.
TI  - Mutualistic biofilm communities develop with Porphyromonas gingivalis and initial, early, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is present in dental plaque as early as 4 h after tooth  cleaning, but it is also associated with periodontal disease, a late-developing event in the microbial successions that characterize daily plaque development. We report here that P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 is remarkable in its ability to interact with a variety of initial, early, middle, and late colonizers growing solely on saliva. Integration of P. gingivalis into multispecies communities was investigated by using two in vitro biofilm models. In flow cells, bacterial growth was quantified using fluorescently conjugated antibodies against each species, and static biofilm growth on saliva-submerged polystyrene pegs was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR using species-specific primers. P. gingivalis could not grow as a single species or together with initial colonizer Streptococcus oralis but showed mutualistic growth when paired with two other initial colonizers, Streptococcus gordonii and Actinomyces oris, as well as with Veillonella sp. (early colonizer), Fusobacterium nucleatum (middle colonizer), and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (late colonizer). In three-species flow cells, P. gingivalis grew with Veillonella sp. and A. actinomycetemcomitans but not with S. oralis and A. actinomycetemcomitans. Also, it grew with Veillonella sp. and F. nucleatum but not with S. oralis and F. nucleatum, indicating that P. gingivalis and S. oralis are not compatible. However, P. gingivalis grew in combination with S. gordonii and S. oralis, demonstrating its ability to overcome the incompatibility when cultured with a second initially colonizing species. Collectively, these data help explain the observed presence of P. gingivalis at all stages of dental plaque development.
TI  - Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans builds mutualistic biofilm communities with Fusobacterium nucleatum and Veillonella species in saliva.
AB  - Human oral bacterial pathogens grow in attached multispecies biofilm communities. Unattached cells are quickly removed by swallowing. Therefore, surface attachment is essential for growth, and we investigated multispecies community interactions resulting in mutualistic growth on saliva as the sole nutritional source. We used two model systems, saliva-coated transferable solid-phase polystyrene pegs (peg biofilms) and flow cells with saliva-coated glass surfaces. Fluorescent antibody staining and image analysis were used to quantify the biomass in flow cells, and quantitative real-time PCR with species-specific primers was used to quantify the biomass in peg biofilms. Veillonella sp. strain PK1910, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans JP2, and Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953 were unable to grow as single species in flow cells. Only A. actinomycetemcomitans grew after 36 h when peg biofilms remained submerged in saliva from the time of inoculation. Mixed-species coaggregates were used for two- and three-species inoculation. The biomass in two-species biofilms increased in both systems when Veillonella sp. strain PK1910 was present as one of the partners. Enhanced growth of all strains was observed in three-species biofilms in flow cells. Interestingly, in flow cells F. nucleatum and A. actinomycetemcomitans exhibited mutualism, and, although F. nucleatum was unable to grow with either of the other species in the peg system, F. nucleatum stimulated the growth of Veillonella sp. and together these two organisms increased the total biomass of A. actinomycetemcomitans in three-species peg biofilms. We propose that mutualistic two-species and multispecies oral biofilm communities form in vivo and that mutualism between commensal veillonellae and late colonizing pathogens, such as aggregatibacteria, contributes to the development of periodontal disease.
TI  - Subgingival temperature (III). Relation to microbial counts.
AB  - The present investigation examined the relationship of selected bacterial species and subgingival temperature. 35 subjects were measured at 6 sites per tooth for clinical parameters and subgingival temperature. Measurements were repeated for 21 subjects at 2 month intervals providing a total of 66 subjects visits. At each visit, subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and anaerobically dispersed, diluted and plated on non-selective media. After anaerobic incubation, colonies were lifted to nylon filters and specific species detected using digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal DNA probes. Species enumerated were; A. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes a and b, B. forsythus, B. gingivalis, B. intermedius I and II, C. ochracea, F. nucleatum ss. vincentii, P. micros, S. intermedius, S. sanguis I and II, V. parvula and W. recta. Total viable counts and counts of Capnocytophaga sp. were determined directly from the primary isolation plates. A total of 1581 samples were evaluated. Subject visits with higher mean subgingival temperatures had significantly higher mean %s of B. intermedius I and P. micros, and lower mean %s of Capnocytophaga sp. Sites with higher subgingival temperatures had elevated proportions of B. intermedius I and II, A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a and B. gingivalis more frequently than sites with lower temperatures, while Capnocytophaga sp. were elevated more often at cooler sites. 43 of the subject visits had follow up attachment level measurements at 2 months. The 1026 microbial samples and the subgingival temperature measurements from these visits were related to longitudinal attachment change.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
