TI  == in vitro protective effect of lactic acid bacteria on listeria monocytogenes adhesion and invasion of caco-2 cells.
AB  == the adhesion of listeria monocytogenes to intestinal endothelial cells is a crucial step in the infection process, which is not well understood. in this study, we evaluated the potential ability of bacteriocin-producing enterococcus faecium, leuconostoc mesenteroides and lactobacillus sakei strains to prevent the adhesion and invasion of eukaryotic cells by ten different l. monocytogenes isolates. the results showed that e. faecium 130 co-cultured with l. monocytogenes was the most effective in preventing infection of caco-2 cells, as  the vast majority of isolates showed significantly lower adhesion counts and invasion rates below the quantification limit of the method (<30 cfu/plate). l. sakei 1 was the least effective strain in preventing l. monocytogenes infection;  only one isolate presented a lower adhesion rate and two isolates reduced the invasion rate of caco-2 cells. fluorescence in situ hybridisation (fish) assay was shown to be an effective tool to illustrate and identify species in co-culture with l. monocytogenes during the adhesion process to caco-2 cells.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese.
AB  == the water buffalo mozzarella cheese is a typical italian cheese which has been introduced in the thriving brazilian market in the last 10 y, with good acceptance by its consumers. lactic acid bacteria (lab) play an important role in the technological and sensory quality of mozzarella cheese. in this study, the aim was to evaluate the diversity of the autochthones viable lab isolated from water buffalo mozzarella cheese under storage. samples were collected in 3 independent trials in a dairy industry located in the southeast region of brazil, on the 28th day of storage, at 4 masculinec. the lab were characterized by gram staining, catalase test, capacity to assimilate citrate, and production of co2 from glucose. the diversity of lab was evaluated by rapd-pcr (randomly amplified  polymorphic dna-polymerase chain reaction), 16s rrna gene sequencing, and by vitek 2 system. twenty lab strains were isolated and clustered into 12 different  clusters, and identified as streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and lactobacillus helveticus. enterococcus species were dominant and  citrate-positive. only the strains of l. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and l. fermentum produced co2 from glucose and were citrate-positive, while l. casei  was only citrate positive. this is the first report which elucidates the lab diversity involved in brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese. furthermore, the results show that despite the absence of natural whey cultures as starters in production, the lab species identified are the ones typically found in mozzarella cheese.

TI  == pyrosequencing vs. culture-dependent approaches to analyze lactic acid bacteria associated to chicha, a traditional maize-based fermented beverage from northwestern argentina.
AB  == the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) associated with chicha, a traditional maize-based fermented alcoholic beverage from northwestern argentina, was analyzed using culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches. samples corresponding to 10 production steps were obtained from two local producers at maimara (chicha m) and tumbaya (chicha t). whereas by culture-dependent approach  a few number of species (lactobacillus plantarum and weissella viridescens in chicha m, and enterococcus faecium and leuconostoc mesenteroides in chicha t) were identified, a higher quantitative distribution of taxa was found in both beverages by pyrosequencing. the relative abundance of otus was higher in chicha  m than in chicha t; six lab genera were common for chicha m and t: enterococcus,  lactococcus, streptococcus, weissella, leuconostoc and lactobacillus while pediococcus only was detected in chicha m. among the 46 identified lab species, those of lactobacillus were dominant in both chicha samples, exhibiting the highest diversity, whereas enterococcus and leuconostoc were recorded as the second dominant genera in chicha t and m, respectively. identification at species level showed the predominance of lb. plantarum, lactobacillus rossiae, leuconostoc lactis and w. viridescens in chicha m while enterococcus hirae, e. faecium, lc. mesenteroides and weissella confusa predominated in chicha t samples. in parallel, when presumptive lab isolates (chicha m: 146; chicha t: 246) recovered from the same samples were identified by isr-pcr and rapd-pcr profiles, species-specific pcr and 16s rrna gene sequencing, most of them were assigned to the leuconostoc genus (lc. mesenteroides and lc. lactis) in chicha m, lactobacillus, weissella and enterococcus being also present. in contrast, chicha t exhibited the presence of enterococcus and leuconostoc, e. faecium being the most representative species. massive sequencing approach was applied for the first time to study the diversity and evolution of microbial communities during chicha manufacture. although differences in the lab species profile between the two geographically different chicha productions were observed by culturing, a larger number for predominant lab species as well as other minorities were revealed by pyrosequencing. the fine molecular inventory achieved by pyrosequencing provided more precise information on lab population composition than culture-dependent analysis processes.

TI  == taxonomic and molecular characterization of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in nunu, a ghanaian fermented milk product.
AB  == produced from raw unpasteurized milk, nunu is a spontaneously fermented yoghurt-like product made in ghana and other parts of west africa. despite the importance of nunu in the diet of many africans, there is currently only limited  information available on the microorganisms associated with nunu processing. with the aim of obtaining a deeper understanding of the process and as a first step towards developing starter cultures with desired technological properties for nunu production, a microbiological characterization of nunu processing in three different towns in the upper east region of ghana, namely bolgatanga, paga and navrongo, was carried out. lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeasts associated with  nunu processing were isolated and identified using a combination of pheno- and genotypic methods including morphological and carbohydrate fermentation tests, (gtg)5-based rep-pcr, multiplex pcr, and 16s and 26s rrna gene sequencing. the lab counts during nunu processing increased from 4.5 +/- 0.4 log cfu/ml at 0 h to 8.7 +/- 1.8 log cfu/ml at 24 h of fermentation while yeasts counts increased from 2.8 +/- 1.2 log cfu/ml at 0 h to 5.8 +/- 0.5 log cfu/ml by the end of fermentation. lactobacillus fermentum was the dominant lab throughout the fermentations with lactobacillus plantarum and leuconostoc mesenteroides playing  prominent roles during the first 6-8 h of fermentation as well. less frequently isolated lab included lactobacillus helveticus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus italicus, weissella confusa and a putatively novel lactococcus spp.  the yeasts involved were identified as candida parapsilosis, candida rugosa, candida tropicalis, galactomyces geotrichum, pichia kudriavzevii and saccharomyces cerevisiae with p. kudriavzevii and s. cerevisiae being the dominant yeast species.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from cheeses and yogurts.
AB  == the biopreservation of foods using bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated directly from foods is an innovative approach. the objectives of this study were to isolate and identify bacteriocinogenic lab from various cheeses and yogurts and evaluate their antimicrobial effects on selected spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in vitro as well as on a food commodity.lab were isolated using mrs and m17 media. the agar diffusion bioassay was used to screen  for bacteriocin or bacteriocin-like substances (bls) producing lab using lactobacillus sakei and listeria innocua as indicator organisms. out of 138 lab isolates, 28 were found to inhibit these bacteria and were identified as strains  of enterococcus faecium, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei using 16s rrna gene sequencing. eight isolates were tested for antimicrobial activity at 5 degrees c and 20 degrees c against l. innocua, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas fluorescens, erwinia carotovora, and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides using the agar diffusion bioassay, and also against penicillium expansum, botrytis cinerea and monilinia frucitcola using the microdilution plate method. the effect of selected lab strains on l. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions was also investigated.twenty percent of our isolates produced bls inhibiting the growth of l. innocua and/or lact. sakei. organic acids and/or h2o2 produced by lab and not  the bls had strong antimicrobial effects on all microorganisms tested with the exception of e. coli. ent. faecium, strep. thermophilus and lact. casei effectively inhibited the growth of natural microflora and l. innocua inoculated  onto fresh-cut onions. bacteriocinogenic lab present in cheeses and yogurts may have potential to be used as biopreservatives in foods.

TI  == presence of erythromycin and tetracycline resistance genes in lactic acid bacteria from fermented foods of indian origin.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) resistant to erythromycin were isolated from different food samples on selective media. the isolates were identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus lactis, enterococcus casseliflavus, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides. of the total 60 isolates, 88 % harbored the ermb gene. the efflux gene msra was identified in e. faecium, e. durans, e. lactis, e. casseliflavus, p. pentosaceus  and l. fermentum. further analysis of the msra gene by sequencing suggested its homology to msrc. resistance to tetracycline due to the genes tetm, tetw, teto, tetk and tetl, alone or in combination, were identified in lactobacillus species. the tetracycline efflux genes tetk and tetl occurred in p. pentosaceus and enterococcus species. since it appeared that lab had acquired these genes, fermented foods may be a source of antibiotic resistance.

TI  == biodiversity and growth dynamics of lactic acid bacteria in artisanal pdo ossau-iraty cheeses made from raw ewe's milk with different starters.
AB  == the biodiversity and growth dynamics of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in farm-house  ossau-iraty cheeses were investigated from vat milk to 180 days of ripening in six independent batches made from six raw ewe's milks using five typical cheese-making methods. commercial starter s1 was used for three batches, starter  s1 combined with s2 for one batch and no starter for two batches. up to ten lab species from five genera and up to two strains per species were identified per milk; up to eleven species from five genera and up to three strains per species were identified per cheese. lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus paracasei, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, and leuconostoc mesenteroides were detected in all cheeses. lactococci reached the highest counts irrespective of the milk and starter used. lactococci and enterococci increased during manufacture, and mesophilic lactobacilli increased during ripening. strain and species numbers, the percentage of isolates originating from the raw milk, maximum counts of each genus/species and time for reaching them, all varied according to whether or not a starter was used and the composition of the starter. the genotypes of strains within species varied according to the raw milk used. this generated distinct lab microbiotas throughout manufacture and ripening that will certainly impact on the characteristics of the ripened cheeses.

TI  == oxalate-degrading capacities of lactic acid bacteria in canine feces.
AB  == in this study, lactic acid bacteria in canine feces were isolated and identified, and their oxalate-degrading capacities were evaluated. the oxalate-degrading capacities were determined for 24 of 47 (51.06%) lactic acid bacteria isolates. of these, 8 isolates [leuconostoc mesenteroides (rl75), lactococcus garvieae (cd2), lactococcus subsp. lactis (cs21), enterococcus faecium (cl71 and cl72), and enterococcus faecalis (cd14, cs62, and cd12)] degraded more than 5% of the oxalate present, while the others degraded less than 5% of the oxalate in vitro.  isolates that degraded more than 5% of the oxalate present were selected for further examination. the oxalate-degrading capacities of individual isolates, a mixture of enterococcus, a mixture of lactococcus, and a mixture of the eight isolates were evaluated in media containing different concentrations of glucose (sufficient, insufficient, or no glucose). in comparison with the control medium, all of the individual isolates and mixtures of isolates could degrade oxalate in  all three groups (p<0.05). in most cases, the isolates growing in medium with 20  g/l of glucose had higher oxalate-degrading capacities than those growing in medium with 2.5 g/l of glucose or no glucose. the mixture of all isolates showed  higher oxalate-degrading capacity than the individual isolates and other mixtures. the oxalate-degrading capacities of the isolates were isolate dependent.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal italian goat cheese.
AB  == the lactic acid bacteria community in traditional goat cheese produced in three dairies in valsesia (piemonte, italy) was studied at different steps of the manufacturing process. these cheeses were produced from raw milk without starter  bacteria, and no protocol was followed during the manufacturing process. three hundred thirty-two isolates were characterized and grouped by results of both morphophysiological tests and random amplification of polymorphic dna plus pcr analysis. bacteria were identified by partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. lactococci were the dominant lactic acid bacteria in raw milk. their initial numbers ranged from 5 to 7 log cfu ml(-1). their levels increased during manufacturing and decreased during ripening. the growth trend for enterococci was comparable to that of lactococci, although enterococci counts were lower. lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, lactococcus garviae, and enterococcus faecalis were the most frequently isolated species during goat cheese manufacturing, whereas the highest numbers of enterococcus (e. faecium, e. durans, e. gilvus, and e. casseliflavus) were isolated with the greatest frequency from ripened cheese samples. occasionally, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc lactis, and lactobacillus paraplantarum also were isolated.

TI  == characterisation and transferability of antibiotic resistance genes from lactic acid bacteria isolated from irish pork and beef abattoirs.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria isolated from irish pork and beef abattoirs were analysed for their susceptibility to antimicrobials. thirty-seven isolates (12 enterococci, 10 lactobacilli, 8 streptococci, 3 lactococci, 2 leuconostoc, and 2  pediococci) were examined for phenotypic resistance using the e-test and their minimum inhibitory concentration to a panel of six antibiotics (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and vancomycin) was recorded. the corresponding genetic determinants responsible were characterised by pcr. also, the transferability of these resistance markers was assessed in filter mating assays. of the 37 isolates, 33 were found to be resistant to one or more antibiotics. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin and chloramphenicol. the erm(b) and msra/b genes were detected among the 11 erythromycin-resistant strains of enterococci, lactobacilli, and streptococci. two tetracycline-resistant strains, lactobacillus plantarum and leuconostoc mesenteroides spp., contained tet(m) and tet(s) genes respectively. intrinsic streptomycin resistance was observed in lactobacilli, streptococci, lactococci and leuconostoc species; none of the common genetic determinants (stra, strb, aada, aade) were identified. four of 10 strains of enterococcus faecium were resistant to vancomycin; however, no corresponding genetic determinants for this  phenotype were identified. enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to vancomycin. l. plantarum, l. mesenteroides and pediococcus pentosaceus were intrinsically resistant to vancomycin. transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants was demonstrated in one strain, wherein the tet(m) gene of l. plantarum (23) isolated from a pork abattoir was transferred to lactococcus lactis bu-2-60 and to e. faecalis jh2-2. this study identified the presence of antibiotic resistance markers in irish meat isolates and, in one example, resistance was conjugally transferred to other lab strains.

TI  == microfluidic technology applied to cell-wall protein analysis of olive related lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == a fully automated electrophoretic method for separating cell-wall proteins was applied to 102 isolates from olive phylloplane and brine previously phenotypically identified as lactobacillus plantarum (10), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (60), leuconostoc spp. (12) and enterococcus faecium (19). the high sensitivity of this technique allowed to discriminate isolates and to distinguish closely related strains within the same species. l. plantarum was characterized by proteins at 70.4 and 163.9 kda, while 3 proteins (20.4, 52.9, 68. kda) were typical for e. faecium. no characteristic proteins were found for leuconostoc isolates except for that at 31.8 kda mainly related to the ecological origin since only isolates from brine showed this protein. however, leuc. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and leuconostoc spp. were differentiated by additional proteins. sequence analysis of the 16s rrna gene of  selected strains was in agreement with the phenotypic identification and allowed  to identify all leuconostoc spp. isolates as leuc. mesenteroides. cell-wall protein fingerprinting performed by microfluidic technology completed the phenotypic characterization of olive-related lactic acid bacteria allowing their  strain typing.

TI  == biodiversity of the microbial community in a spanish farmhouse cheese as revealed by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == the microbial diversity within alberquilla cheese, made from a spontaneously fermented mixture of raw goats' and sheep's milk in the alpujarra mountains (granada, south-east spain), has been studied by the classical culturing method and also by molecular analysis of community dna. a collection of 206 isolates was obtained from the cheese on different selective/differential media, which were then re-grouped to 52 after randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analyses. isolates on man-rogosa and sharpe-agar (mrs), m17-glucose agar and kenner fecal (kf)-agar medium were identified by specific pcr or 16s rrna gene sequencing and belonged mainly to the lactic-acid bacteria group. the predominant genus was lactobacillus, which accounted for more than 50% of the isolates, the most abundant species being lactobacillus paracasei, followed by considerably less quantities of lb. plantarum and lb. brevis. other lactic-acid bacteria identified were pediococcus urinaequi, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, leuc. mesenteroides, lactococcus lactis and even the enterococci enterococcus faecium and e. devriesei. cluster analyses of rapd-pcr patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among the lactobacilli. the gram-negative bacterial strains belonged mainly to hafnia alvei species. the microbes occurring in alberquilla cheese were also studied by pcr temporal temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (ttge) of the 16s rrna v3 region and partial 16s rrna sequencing of the ttge bands. the results showed a major presence of lactic-acid bacteria closely related to lc. lactis, lb. paracasei, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. acidophilus and enterococcus sp. the non-lactic-acid bacterium detected was identified as escherichia coli. all the enterococcus strains showed great susceptibility to the most clinically relevant antibiotics, harbouring only the virulence gene efaafm.  on the basis of their antimicrobial activity against listeria monocytogenes we chose two strains of ln. mesenteroides that produced mesenterocin b105 and mesenterocin y105, as revealed by pcr techniques.

TI  == identification and characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from tibetan qula cheese.
AB  == fourteen strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from qula, a tibetan traditional yak cheese, were divided into four groups (a-d) according to morphological and biochemical characteristics. on the basis of the 16s rrna gene  sequence analysis, group a and group b strains were placed in the cluster making  up the genus leuconostoc, which together with leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, formed a distinct cluster. the group c strain was clearly identified as enterococcus faecium by forming a very well defined cluster with this species. the group d strains were placed in the lactobacilli cluster with lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus pentosus being the closely related species. on the basis of dna-dna hybridization, strains in the groups a,  b, c and d were identified as leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, enterococcus faecium and lactobacillus plantarum, respectively. leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum was the dominate member of the population.

TI  == characterization of italian cheeses ripened under nonconventional conditions.
AB  == four italian cheeses (casciotta di urbino, barricato san martino, vento d'estate, and ubriaco di raboso) nonconventionally ripened under different plant materials  (walnut leaves, herbs, hay, and wine by-products, respectively) were compared for compositional, microbiological, biochemical, and volatile profile characteristics. mean values for gross composition were rather similar. because primary starters were not used for manufacture, the endogenous lactic acid bacteria were mainly present (7.0 to 9.0 log10 cfu/g). except for lactobacillus paracasei and leuconostoc mesenteroides, which were commonly identified in 3 cheeses, lactococcus lactis, enterococcus sanguinicola, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus durans/enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus plantarum, and weissella  cibaria/weissella confusa were variously found in the 4 cheeses. random amplification of polymorphic dna-pcr analysis showed the biodiversity among the strains, and the species of lactobacilli were in part grouped according to their  origin. as shown by the principal component analysis of reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography data for the ph 4.6-soluble fractions and by the determination of free aa, the secondary proteolysis of barricato san martino and  vento d'estate mainly differed from the other 2 cheeses. purge-and-trap and solid-phase microextraction were coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to determine volatile compounds. vento d'estate showed the highest levels of almost all chemical classes, and casciotta di urbino was characterized  by a very low level of volatile components. esters, ketones, and terpenes were the chemical classes that mainly differentiated the cheeses. several volatile compounds seemed to be released directly from the plant materials used for ripening, especially terpenes for vento d'estate cheese. the lowest level of volatile free fatty acids was found in casciotta d'urbino, in which rennet paste  was not used during manufacture. the highest concentration of free fatty acids, especially butyric and caproic acids, was found in vento d'estate cheese.

AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == phenotypic identification and technological properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditionally processed fish products of the eastern himalayas.
AB  == sukako maacha, gnuchi, sidra and sukuti are traditional smoked and sun-dried fish products of the eastern himalayan regions of nepal and india. a total of 40 samples of sukako maacha (14), gnuchi (6), sidra (10) and sukuti (10) were collected and were analysed for microbial load. population of lactic acid bacteria (lab) as well as aerobic mesophilic counts ranged from 4.7-8.3 to 5.1-8.5 log cfu g(-1), respectively. a total of 189 strains of lab were isolated  from sukako maacha, gnuchi, sidra and sukuti samples, out of which 171 strains were cocci and 15 strains, were heterofermentative lactobacilli. lab were identified on the basis of phenotypic characters including api system as lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactococcus plantarum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, pediococcus pentosaceus and weissella confusa. lab strains produced a wide spectrum of enzymes. some strains of lab showed antagonistic properties against pathogenic strains. none of the strains produced biogenic amines in the method applied. this paper is the first report on the microbial composition, mostly lactic acid bacteria, of traditionally processed fish products of eastern  himalayas.

TI  == monitoring the lactic acid bacterial diversity during shochu fermentation by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == the presence of lactic acid bacteria (lab) during shochu fermentation was monitored by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and by bacteriological culturing. no lab were detected from fermented mashes by pcr-dgge using a universal bacterial pcr primer set. however, pcr-dgge using a new primer  specific for the 16s rdna of lactococcus, streptococcus, tetragenococcus, enterococcus, and vagococcus and two primers specific for the 16s rdna of lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, and weissella revealed that enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus nagelii, lactobacillus plantarum, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and weissella cibaria inhabited in shochu mashes. it was also found that the lab community composition during shochu fermentation changed after the main ingredient and water were added during the fermentation process. therefore, we confirmed that pcr-dgge using all three primers specific for groups of lab together was well suited to the study of the lab diversity in shochu mashes. the results of dgge profiles were similar to the results of bacteriological culturing. in conclusion, lab are present during shochu fermentation but not dominant.

AB  == bacteriocin-producing strains of lactobacillus plantarum st23ld and st341ld, enterococcus faecium st311ld and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides st33ld were isolated from the brine of spoiled black olives. the bacteriocins produced by all four strains inhibited the growth of gram-positive bacteria (e. faecalis, l. casei and streptococcus pneumoniae), but also escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. strain st23ld produced two bacteriocins (st23lda and st23ldb of approximately 3.0 and 14.0 kda, respectively), with a combined maximum level of activity of 25,600 au/ml after 18 h of growth. the same level of activity was recorded for bacteriocin st341ld (approximately 3.0 kda), but after  16 h. bacteriocins st311ld (ca. 2.3 kda) and st33ld (ca. 2.7 kda) were produced at much lower levels (6400 au/ml), and only after 20 h of growth. bacteriocin activity was destroyed after treatment with proteolytic enzymes and triton x, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta, or when heated for 20 min at 121 degrees c. addition of bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st311ld to cells of lactobacillus casei lhs in logarithmic phase resulted in  growth inhibition for one hour, followed by a slight increase in optical density  over the next seven hours. bacteriocin st33ld also inhibited the growth of strain lhs, but to a lesser extent. bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st33ld remained at  the same level of activity for 6 h at ph<4.0. however, the activity of bacteriocin st311ld decreased by 50% within 2 h at ph 4.4. the possibility of the bacteriocin adsorbing to the producer cell and proteolytic degradation is unlikely.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from aoc salers cheese.
AB  == the objective of this work was to describe the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  in traditional raw milk salers cheeses at the species and strain levels. the characterization of 381 strains isolated during ripening and various strain collections was investigated using physiological analysis and molecular techniques: rep-pcr, species and genus specific amplifications and the sequence analysis of 16s rdna for strain typing and taxonomic identification. the strains  belonged to lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garviae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus millieri, streptococcus macedonicus and pediococcus pentosaceus. a  wide phenotypic and genomic heterogeneity was observed within the different species (lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and leuconostoc mesenteroides) according to the origin and the time of ripening. the natural microflora was different from strain collection and each method must be combined  to identify and characterize natural microflora. this study revealed the low selectivity of selective media used for the isolation of different groups of lactic acid bacteria except the facultatively heterofermentative lactobacilli medium selecting mesophile lactobacilli and sb medium selective for enterococcus. the study reveals, for the first time, the microbial lactic acid bacteria community of salers cheese and its diversity. a better knowledge of microbial flora will be useful to improve understanding of sensory quality of cheeses.

TI  == bacterial community dynamics during production of registered designation of origin salers cheese as evaluated by 16s rrna gene single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis.
AB  == microbial dynamics during processing and ripening of traditional cheeses such as  registered designation of origin salers cheese, an artisanal cheese produced in france, play an important role in the elaboration of sensory qualities. the aim of the present study was to obtain a picture of the dynamics of the microbial ecosystem of rdo salers cheese by using culture-independent methods. this included dna extraction, pcr, and single-strand conformation polymorphism (sscp)  analysis. bacterial and high-gc% gram-positive bacterial primers were used to amplify v2 or v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene. sscp patterns revealed changes during the manufacturing of the cheese. patterns of the ecosystems of cheeses that were provided by three farmers were also quite different. cloning and sequencing of the 16s rrna gene revealed sequences related to lactic acid bacteria (lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus pentosus), which were predominant during manufacturing and ripening. bacteria belonging to the high-gc% gram-positive group (essentially corynebacteria) were found by using specific primers. the present molecular approach can effectively describe the ecosystem of artisanal dairy products.

TI  == esterolytic and lipolytic activities of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ewe's  milk and cheese.
AB  == in the present work, we report on the esterase and lipase activities of lactic acid bacteria representing the genera lactococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus, and enterococcus isolated from ewe's milk and cheeses. esterase activity was studied using alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 12 carbon atoms and postelectrophoretic detection. the lactic acid bacteria evaluated had intracellular esterase activities, which preferentially degraded the alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 6 carbon atoms. by studying postelectrophoretic patterns, it was found that some strains presented more than one esterase. lactobacillus plantarum o236 showed four enzymes that hydrolyze carboxyl ester linkages with different specificity. lipase activity was studied in intracellular and extracellular fractions using tributyrin, tricaprylin, triolein, and milk fat as substrates. the intracellular and extracellular fractions of leuconostoc mesenteroides o257, lactobacillus plantarum o236, and lactobacillus acidophilus o177 were able to hydrolyze tributyrin. l. plantarum o186, l. acidophilus o252, enterococcus faecium o174 and o426, and enterococcus faecalis ov409 showed lipase activity associated with the intracellular fraction on tributyrin. lactococcus lactis o233, l. plantarum o155, and lactobacillus casei o190 did not hydrolyze triglycerides. not all strains that showed esterase activity exhibited high activity on triglycerides. esterase and lipase activities were species- and strain-specific. wide variations in activity between strains highlight the need for selecting appropriate starters to produce enzyme-modified cheese as well as accelerated ripened cheese.

TI  == effect of leavening microflora on pizza dough properties.
AB  == fourteen different starter cultures containing one strain of saccharomyces cerevisiae with and without individual or combinations of lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus plantarum, lact. sanfrancisco, enterococcus faecium, leuconostoc mesenteroides) were employed to investigate the role of leavening microflora on the properties of pizza doughs. microbiological, chemical and physical characteristics of doughs prepared with the same flour and under the same processing conditions were determined. leavening times and acidification properties depended on the microbial association used. the proportions of lactic  and acetic acid produced by lactic acid bacteria were consistent with the metabolic properties of the strains employed. the bacteria/yeast ratios arising from microbial counts at the end of the leavening process were always lower in comparison to sour- or bread-doughs. the size of the yeast population did not change much, while bacteria showed from one to four duplications. rheologically,  the fermented doughs could only be significantly distinguished from the control dough with regard to the elastic modulus. principal component analysis was applied to the acidimetric data. the scattergram of the two principal components  effectively discriminated 13 of the 14 pizza dough types.

TI  == semiquantitation of cooperativity in binding of vancomycin-group antibiotics to vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant organisms.
AB  == the association of vancomycin group antibiotics with the growing bacterial cell wall was investigated by using the cell wall precursor analog di-n-acetyl-lys-d-ala-d-ala in competition binding experiments. the affinities of the antibiotics for the -d-ala-d-ala-containing cell wall precursors of bacillus  subtilis atcc 6633 (a model for vancomycin-susceptible gram-positive bacteria) and for the -d-ala-d-lac-containing cell wall precursors of leuconostoc mesenteroides (a model for vancomycin-resistant strains of enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis) were determined by a whole-cell assay. the binding of  strongly dimerizing antibiotics such as eremomycin to the bacterial surface was thus shown to be enhanced by up to 2 orders of magnitude (relative to the binding in free solution) by the chelate effect, whereas weakly dimerizing antibiotics like vancomycin and antibiotics carrying lipid tails (teicoplanin) benefited less (ca. 1 order of magnitude). the affinity measured in this way correlates well with the mic of the antibiotic, and a consequence of this is that future design of semisynthetic vancomycin-group antibiotics should attempt to incorporate chelate effect-enhancing structural features.

TI  == heterogeneity of the vana gene cluster in clinical isolates of enterococci from the northeastern united states.
AB  == in several strains of enterococcus faecium isolated in europe, the cluster of genes encoding high-level resistance to vancomycin (vana phenotype) resides on a  10.85-kb transposon, tn1546, or closely related elements. to determine whether tn1546 was conserved in recent enterococcal isolates from the northeastern united states, seven strains were compared by restriction mapping and dna hybridization  with probes from within the van cluster. two of the seven strains contained intact tn1546-like sequences; however, in five of the strains, the organization of the van cluster differed from that of tn1546. three of the five strains with variations harbored a novel dna segment within the van gene cluster. this 1,496-bp segment was similar to is1165 of leuconostoc mesenteroides and is1181 of staphylococcus aureus and was flanked by 24- and 23-bp imperfect inverted repeats and 8-bp direct repeats. on the basis of these findings, we propose that this element comprises a novel insertion-like sequence, is1251. multiple copies of is1251 were also present at other sites in both resistant and susceptible clinical isolates. our findings suggest that the van cluster in recent isolates from the northeastern united states differs from that present in the early european vana phenotype strains.

TI  == characterisation of lactic acid bacteria isolated from naturally fermented greek  dry salami.
AB  == a total of 348 lactic acid bacteria isolated from five batches of naturally fermented dry salami at various stages of ripening were characterised. the majority of the strains were assigned to two main phylogenetic groups of species: (i) the psychrotrophic, formerly called atypical, meat streptobacteria (169 strains) and (ii) a new genus weissella (120), which was recently proposed (collins et al., 1993) to include leuconostoc paramesenteroides and some other closely related species. meat streptobacteria were identified as lactobacillus curvatus (88 strains) and l. sake (76), whereas 5 strains were indistinguishable  and, thus designated l. sake/curvatus. non-psychrotrophic streptobacteria were also isolated and identified as l. plantarum (34 strains), l. farciminis (10), l. coryniformis (1) and l. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (1). the majority of the weissella strains (86) were leuconostoc-like bacteria; four of them were identified as w. viridescens, 11 belonged to the newly described w. hellenica (collins et al., 1993), another 11 resembled w. paramesenteroides, whereas 60 isolates were not classified to any species. the latter group comprised strains that produced d(l)-lactate. the remaining weissella were gas-forming, arginine-positive rods assigned to w. minor (31) and w. halotolerans (3). other species identified were enterococcus faecium (10), leuconostoc mesenteroides (1), l. brevis (1) and pediococcus sp. (1). the main criteria used to distinguish between above species as well as their distribution on the five salami batches in relation to their succession with time and suitability as starters were discussed.

TI  == modification of peptidoglycan precursors is a common feature of the low-level vancomycin-resistant vanb-type enterococcus d366 and of the naturally glycopeptide-resistant species lactobacillus casei, pediococcus pentosaceus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and enterococcus gallinarum.
AB  == the biochemical basis for the acquired or natural resistance of various gram-positive organisms to glycopeptides was studied by high-pressure liquid chromatographic analysis of their peptidoglycan udp-murnac-peptide precursors. in all cases, resistance was correlated with partial or complete replacement of the  c-terminal d-ala-d-ala-containing udp-murnac-pentapeptide by a new precursor with a modified c terminus. nuclear magnetic resonance analysis by sequential assignment showed that the new precursor encountered in enterococcus faecium d366, a strain belonging to the vanb class, which expresses low-level resistance  to vancomycin, was udp-murnac-l-ala-gamma-d-glu-l-lys-d-ala-d-lactate, identical  to that previously found in the vana class, which expresses high-level resistance to vancomycin. high-pressure liquid chromatographic analyses, composition determinations, and digestion by r39 d,d-carboxypeptidase demonstrated the exclusive presence of the new precursor in lactobacillus casei and pediococcus pentosaceus, which are naturally highly resistant to glycopeptides. the low-level natural resistance of enterococcus gallinarum to vancomycin was found to be associated with the synthesis of a new precursor identified as a udp-murnac-pentapeptide containing a c-terminal d-serine. the distinction between low and high levels of resistance to glycopeptides appeared also to depend on the presence or absence of a substantial residual pool of a d-ala-d-ala-containing udp-murnac-pentapeptide.

TI  == vancomycin-resistant leuconostoc mesenteroides and lactobacillus casei synthesize cytoplasmic peptidoglycan precursors that terminate in lactate.
AB  == the emergence of acquired high-level resistance among enterococcus species has renewed interest in mechanisms of resistance to glycopeptide antibiotics in gram-positive bacteria. in enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, resistance is encoded by the van gene cluster and is due to the production of a peptidoglycan precursor terminating in d-alanyl-d-lactate, to which vancomycin does not bind. most leuconostoc and many lactobacillus species are intrinsically  resistant to high levels of glycopeptide antibiotics, but the mechanism of resistance has not been elucidated. to determine whether the mechanisms of resistance are similar in intrinsically resistant bacteria, cytoplasmic peptidoglycan precursors were isolated from leuconostoc mesenteroides and lactobacillus casei and analyzed by mass spectrometry, revealing structures consistent with udp-n-acetylmuramyl-l-ala-d-glu-l-lys-(l-ala)-d-ala-d-lactate and udp-n-acetylmuramyl-l-ala-d-glu-l-lys-d-ala-d-lactate, respectively.

AB  == the uptake kinetics of sugars present in wheat doughs and alpha-glucosidase as well as beta-fructosidase activities were determined in different strains of yeasts and lactic acid bacteria. these strains were previously selected according to their breadmaking quality. saccharomyces cerevisiae (p6), candida guilliermondii (p40), lactobacillus plantarum (b31 and la18) and l. brevis (b21)  showed good performance, while sacch. fructuum (p43), l. cellobiosus (b37) and enterococcus faecium (b11) yielded bread of lower quality. leuconostoc mesenteroides (b10), when used in combination with other strains led also to high quality starters. all yeast strains used assimilated glucose, fructose and maltose, exhibiting saturable kinetics. lactic acid bacteria showed saturable kinetics only for hexoses, whereas disaccharide uptake was linear. sacch. cerevisiae, leuconostoc mesenteroides, l. brevis and l. plantarum (b31) displayed better sugar uptake properties. for all the strains used alpha-glucosidase and beta-fructosidase activities were detected. the highest specific activities were  found for sacch. cerevisiae, c. guilliermondii and l. plantarum (b31). these results indicate good correlation between the parameters evaluated and the breadmaking potential of the microorganisms.

TI  == molecular basis for vancomycin resistance in enterococcus faecium bm4147: biosynthesis of a depsipeptide peptidoglycan precursor by vancomycin resistance proteins vanh and vana.
AB  == vancomycin resistance in enterococcus faecium bm4147 is mediated by vancomycin resistance proteins vana and vanh. vana is a d-alanine:d-alanine ligase of altered substrate specificity [bugg, t. d. h., dutka-malen, s., arthur, m., courvalin, p., & walsh, c. t. (1991) biochemistry 30, 2017-2021], while the sequence of vanh is related to those of alpha-keto acid dehydrogenases [arthur, m., molinas, c., dutka-malen, s., & courvalin, p. (1991) gene (submitted)]. we report purification of vanh to homogeneity, characterization as a d-specific alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase, and comparison with d-lactate dehydrogenases from  leuconostoc mesenteroides and lactobacillus leichmanii. vana was found to catalyze ester bond formation between d-alanine and the d-hydroxy acid products of vanh, the best substrate being d-2-hydroxybutyrate (km = 0.60 mm). the vana product d-alanyl-d-2-hydroxybutyrate could then be incorporated into the udpmurnac-pentapeptide peptidoglycan precursor by d-ala-d-ala adding enzyme from  escherichia coli or by crude extract from e. faecium bm4147. the vancomycin binding constant of a synthetic modified peptidoglycan analogue n-acetyl-d-alanyl-d-2-hydroxybutyrate (kd greater than 73 mm) was greater than 1000-fold higher than the binding constant for n-acetyl-d-alanyl-d-alanine (kd =  54 microm), partly due to the disruption of a hydrogen bond in the vancomycin-target complex, thus providing a molecular rationale for high-level vancomycin resistance.

AB  == this study shows for the first time microheterogeneity of 1,3-linked poly(glycerophosphate) lipoteichoic acids. the lipoteichoic acids investigated were those of enterococcus faecalis kiel 27738 (i), enterococcus hirae (streptococcus faecium) atcc 9790 (ii), and leuconostoc mesenteroides dms 20343 (iii). lipoteichoic acids ii and iii are partially substituted by mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl residues with (1----2) interglycosidic linkages. lipoteichoic acid i is substituted with alpha-kojibiosyl residues only. lipoteichoic acids i and iii additionally carry d-alanine ester. lipoteichoic acids were separated on columns of concanavalin-a-sepharose according to their increasing number of glycosyl substituents per chain. it was evident that all molecular species are usually glycosylated and that alanine ester and glycosyl residues occur on the same chains. the chain lengths of lipoteichoic acid i and ii vary between 9-40 glycerophosphate residues, whereas those of lipoteichoic acid iii appear to be uniform (33 +/- 2 residues). molecular species differ in the extent of glycosylation but their content of alanyl residues is fairly constant. all lipoteichoic acids contain a small fraction (5-15%) different in composition from the bulk and most likely reflecting an early stage of biosynthesis. two procedures for chain length determination of poly(glycerophosphate) lipoteichoic acids are described.

TI  == effect of lactic acid bacteria on growth of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == cultures of lactic acid bacteria, mostly from foods, were tested for their effect on the growth of staphylococcus aureus in trypticase soy broth (bbl). some of the effectors, e.g., streptococcus faecalis, s. faecium, lactobacillus lactis, l. brevis, and leuconostoc mesenteroides, stimulated growth of s. aureus during early hours of growth, especially at higher temperatures of incubation, but most  cultures were inhibitory, and some (s. faecium and l. mesenteroides) were even killing by the time of attainment of the maximal phase of growth of the staphylococcus. low-temperature meat lactobacilli and leuconostoc dextranicum inhibited s. aureus at 10, 15, 20, and 25 c throughout its growth. streptococcus  faecalis var. liquefaciens inhibited at these temperatures and at 30 and 37 c, as well. when the ratio of effectors to staphylococci in the inoculum was 100:1, the three enterococci, the meat lactobacillus, and l. dextranicum prevented the attainment of 5 x 10(6) staphylococci per milliliter at 15 c, and all but the meat lactobacillus did so at 22 c. a ratio of 1:1 accomplished similar results at 15 c, except that s. aureus was only delayed for 12 hr by s. faecalis. a ratio of 1:100 usually was ineffective. in general, the more effector bacteria there were  in the inoculum, the greater was the overall inhibition (or stimulation) of s. aureus. inhibition was most effective at 10 or 15 c, less so at 20 or 25 c, and least at 30 or 37 c, whereas stimulation during early growth was greater at the higher temperatures. results with different strains of the effectors and with two strains of s. aureus were similar, for the most part.
