TI  == the novel species streptococcus tigurinus and its association with oral infection.
AB  == streptococcus tigurinus is a novel species of viridans streptococci, shown to cause severe invasive infections such as infective endocarditis, spondylodiscitis and meningitis. s. tigurinus belongs to the streptococcus mitis group and is most closely related to streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae and streptococcus infantis. the presence of s. tigurinus in the human oral cavity has been documented, including  in patients with periodontal disease. this review addresses the available scientific knowledge on s. tigurinus and its association with closely related streptococci, and discusses its putative involvement in common oral infections. while there is as yet no strong evidence on the involvement of s. tigurinus with  oral infections, its presence in the oral cavity and its association with endocarditis warrants special attention for a link between oral and systemic infection.

TI  == isolation of streptococcus tigurinus - a novel member of streptococcus mitis group from a case of periodontitis.
AB  == streptococcus tigurinus is a new member of the streptococcus viridians group and  is closely related to streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus infantis. the type strain az_3a(t) of s. tigurinus was originally isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis. accurate identification of s. tigurinus is facilitated only by newer molecular methods like 16s rrna gene analysis. during the course of study on bacteraemia and infective endocarditis with reference to periodontitis and viridians group of streptococci, a strain of s. tigurinus isolated from subgingival plaque of a patient with periodontitis identified by 16s rrna gene analysis, which was originally identified as streptococcus pluranimalium by vitek 2. confirmation by 16s rrna gene analysis showed 99.39% similarity (1476/1485 bp) with s. tigurinus az_3a(t) (aoru01000002). to the best  of our knowledge, this is the first report of isolation of s. tigurinus from the  oral cavity of a periodontitis patient.

TI  == occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  == the distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd, in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. zmpb was ubiquitous in the mitis and salivarius groups of the genus streptococcus and in the genera gemella and granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented  gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. iga1 protease activity was observed in all members of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis, s. sanguinis, and gemella haemolysans, was variably  present in s. mitis and s. infantis, and absent in s. gordonii, s. parasanguinis, s. cristatus, s. oligofermentans, s. australis, s. peroris, and s. suis. phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes  provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpb, and zmpd genes in s. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. the widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpb, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is  likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. importance: the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. this study maps the presence of the  corresponding genes and enzyme activities in s. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera streptococcus, gemella, and granulicatella. the distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpb is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. the zmpb  protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the mitis and salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. the relative sequence  diversification of the iga1 protease, zmpb, and zmpd is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen s. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.

TI  == streptococcus tigurinus, a novel member of the streptococcus mitis group, causes  invasive infections.
AB  == we recently described the novel species streptococcus tigurinus sp. nov. belonging to the streptococcus mitis group. the type strain az_3a(t) of s. tigurinus was originally isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis. according to its phenotypic and molecular characteristics, s. tigurinus is most closely related to streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus infantis. accurate identification of s. tigurinus is facilitated by 16s rrna gene analysis. we retrospectively analyzed our 16s rrna gene molecular database, which contains sequences of all clinical samples obtained in our institute since 2003. we detected 17 16s rrna gene sequences which were assigned to s. tigurinus, including sequences from the 3 s. tigurinus strains described previously. s. tigurinus originated from normally sterile body sites, such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or heart valves, of 14 patients and was initially detected by culture or broad-range 16s rrna gene pcr, followed by sequencing. the 14 patients had serious invasive infections, i.e., infective endocarditis (n = 6), spondylodiscitis (n = 3), bacteremia (n = 2), meningitis (n = 1), prosthetic joint infection (n = 1), and thoracic empyema (n = 1). to evaluate the presence of streptococcus tigurinus in the endogenous oral microbial flora, we screened saliva specimens of 31 volunteers. after selective growth, alpha-hemolytic growing colonies were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) and subsequent molecular methods. s. tigurinus was not identified among 608 strains analyzed. these data indicate that s. tigurinus is not widely distributed in the oral cavity. in conclusion, s. tigurinus is a novel agent of invasive infections, particularly infective endocarditis.

TI  == partial recn gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus streptococcus.
AB  == partial sequences of the recn gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. the partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. the mean dna sequence similarity of recn gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be  lower than those of the 16s rrna gene (94.1 %), rpob (84.6 %), soda (74.8 %), groel (78.1 %) and gyrb (73.2 %). phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: streptococcus salivarius, s. equinus, s. hyovaginalis/s. pluranimalium/s. thoraltensis, s. pyogenes, s. mutans and s. suis. the 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: streptococcus sanguinis/s. cristatus/s. sinensis, s. anginosus/s. intermedius/s. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and s. mitis/s. infantis/s. peroris/s. oralis/s. oligofermentans/s. pneumoniae/s. pseudopneumoniae. the partial recn gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. this observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groel, gyrb, rpob and soda). a high percentage of similarity was found between s. intermedius and s. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recn gene. to study the genetic  diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recn, groel, soda, gyrb and rpob sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. the results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.

TI  == evolution of streptococcus pneumoniae and its close commensal relatives.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is a member of the mitis group of streptococci which, according to 16s rrna-sequence based phylogenetic reconstruction, includes 12 species. while other species of this group are considered prototypes of commensal bacteria, s. pneumoniae is among the most frequent microbial killers worldwide. population genetic analysis of 118 strains, supported by demonstration of a distinct cell wall carbohydrate structure and competence pheromone sequence signature, shows that s. pneumoniae is one of several hundred evolutionary lineages forming a cluster separate from streptococcus oralis and streptococcus infantis. the remaining lineages of this distinct cluster are commensals previously collectively referred to as streptococcus mitis and each represent separate species by traditional taxonomic standard. virulence genes including the operon for capsule polysaccharide synthesis and genes encoding iga1 protease, pneumolysin, and autolysin were randomly distributed among s. mitis lineages. estimates of the evolutionary age of the lineages, the identical location of remnants of virulence genes in the genomes of commensal strains, the pattern of genome reductions, and the proportion of unique genes and their origin support the model that the entire cluster of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, and s. mitis lineages evolved from pneumococcus-like bacteria presumably pathogenic to the common immediate ancestor of hominoids. during their adaptation to a commensal life style, most of the lineages gradually lost the majority of genes determining virulence and became genetically distinct due to sexual isolation in  their respective hosts.
