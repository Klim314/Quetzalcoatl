TI  == identification of a 43-kda outer membrane protein of fusobacterium necrophorum that exhibits similarity with pore-forming proteins of other fusobacterium species.
AB  == a pair of primers was designed in an attempt to amplify outer membrane protein (omp) gene of fusobacterium necrophorum based on nucleotide sequence of the omp of fusobacterium nucleatum. further analysis was performed to characterize its molecular properties and phylogeny in the genus fusobacterium. we identified a predicated 43kda outer membrane protein (43k omp) in f. necrophorum, which showed the same properties as other pore-forming proteins of gram-negative anaerobic bacteria according to analysis of signal peptide, at-rich, membrane-spanning region and conserved motifs. the predicated 43k omp exhibited 70.22%, 62.04%, 56.75%, 58.72%, 51.59%, 31.49% and 50.26% amino acid identity with the omps of f. nucleatum, fusobacterium varium, fusobacterium ucerans, fusobacterium periodonticum, fusobacterium mortiferum, fusobacterium gonidiaformans and f. necrophorum (hypothetical protein), respectively. 11 common conserved domains and 10 common variable domains were found among the 45 aligned omps of fusobacterium  species. distributions of the conserved and variable domains were highly associated with predicted membrane-spanning regions, cell surface exposed regions and b-cell epitope regions. phylogenetic analysis revealed the predicated 43k omp of f. necrophorum was closely related with the omps from f. nucleatum and f. periodonticum. these data will increase understanding of pathogenesis and genetic evolution of f. necrophorum.

TI  == 16s-23s rdna internal transcribed spacer sequences for analysis of the phylogenetic relationships among species of the genus fusobacterium.
AB  == the 16s-23s rdna internal transcribed spacer (its) regions of all currently defined fusobacterium species and related taxa such as leptotrichia buccalis, sebaldella termitidis and streptobacillus moniliformans, were analysed to examine inter- and intraspecies as well as subspecies relationships. for the its-amplification, a new eubacterial universal primer pair was designed and used. the majority of the fusobacterium strains, along with l. buccalis showed one major, and two to three weaker, distinct bands (short and long versions) with lengths of 800-830 bp and 1000-1100 bp. nevertheless, six other patterns were also found within the genus fusobacterium, demonstrating its heterogeneity. the its region was sequenced and found to consist both of conserved motifs, which functioned as a framework for alignment, and of variable sites, which provided high phylogenetic resolution. analyses of the its-dna sequences and its relative  length (short version) allowed species and subspecies differentiation in most cases. the results confirmed the strikingly distant relationship between fusobacterium prausnitzii and the genus fusobacterium. fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, along with fusobacterium naviforme, fusobacterium simiae and fusobacterium periodonticum, formed a cluster with an inherently high potential for diversification. other clusters were formed by fusobacterium necrophorum subspecies with fusobacterium gonidaformans and by fusobacterium varium with fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium ulcerans. fusobacterium russii as well as fusobacterium perfoetens formed separate branches. fusobacterium necrophorum subspp. necrophorum and funduliforme on the one hand, and fusobacterium varium and fusobacterium mortiferum on the other, were found to be very similar, even at the high-resolution its level.

TI  == intrageneric relationships of members of the genus fusobacterium as determined by reverse transcriptase sequencing of small-subunit rrna.
AB  == the phylogenetic interrelationships of 14 members of the genus fusobacterium were investigated by performing a comparative analysis of the 16s rrna sequences of these organisms. the sequence data revealed considerable intrageneric heterogeneity. the four species fusobacterium nucleatum (including f. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, f. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, "f. nucleatum subsp. fusiforme," and "f. nucleatum subsp. animalis"), fusobacterium alocis, fusobacterium periodonticum, and fusobacterium simiae, which colonize oral cavities, exhibited high levels of sequence homology with each other and formed a distinct group within the genus. fusobacterium mortiferum, fusobacterium varium,  and fusobacterium ulcerans also formed a phylogenetically coherent group, as did  the two species fusobacterium gonidiaformans and fusobacterium necrophorum. fusobacterium russii and fusobacterium necrogenes displayed no specific relationship with any of the other fusobacteria. the sequence data are discussed  in the context of previous physiological and chemical findings.

TI  == identification of fusobacterium species by the electrophoretic migration of glutamate dehydrogenase and 2-oxoglutarate reductase in relation to their dna base composition and peptidoglycan dibasic amino acids.
AB  == rapid identification of fusobacterium spp. is hampered by their inability to ferment carbohydrates and the availability of relatively few useful phenotypic characters. in an attempt to identify new diagnostic markers for species, we reported recently the potential utility of glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) electrophoretic mobilities for distinguishing eight species of fusobacterium. we  have extended these observations to include all recognised members of the genus except f. prausnitzii and f. perfoetens, and our results show that they cluster into three broad electrophoretic groups. some species, such as f. periodonticum,  f. simiae and f. necrophorum, possessed gdh with similar electrophoretic mobilities. however, within such clusters, the electrophoretic migration of 2-oxoglutarate reductase (ogr) distinguished between species. neither gdh or ogr  mobility alone clearly differentiated all species, but their combined use provided unambiguous discrimination of all species except f. varium and f. mortiferum. the dna base compositions of all species except f. naviforme (atcc 25832) and f. sulci, were within the range 26-34 mol% g + c, suggesting the genus may be homogeneous. however, the peptidoglycan composition divided the genus into two major groups that contained either lanthionine or diaminopimelic acid; f. mortiferum peptidoglycan contained both dibasic amino acids.
