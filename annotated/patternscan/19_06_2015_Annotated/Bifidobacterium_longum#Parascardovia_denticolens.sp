TI  == pulp and plaque microbiotas of children with severe early childhood caries.
AB  == background and objective: bacterial invasion into pulps of primary teeth can lead to infection and premature tooth loss in children. this pilot study aimed to explore whether the microbiota of carious exposures of dental pulps resembles that of carious dentin or that of infected root canals. design: children with severe early childhood caries were studied. children were consented and extent of caries, plaque, and gingivitis measured. bacteria were sampled from carious lesion biofilms and vital carious exposures of pulps, and processed by anaerobic  culture. isolates were characterized from partial sequences of the 16s rrna gene  and identified by comparison with taxa in the human oral microbiome database (http://www.homd.org). the microbiotas of carious lesions and dental pulps were compared using univariate and multivariate approaches. results: the microbiota of cariously exposed pulps was similar in composition to that of carious lesion biofilms except that fewer species/taxa were identified from pulps. the major taxa identified belonged to the phyla firmicutes (mainly streptococci) and actinobacteria (mainly actinomyces species). actinomyces and selenomonas species  were associated with carious lesions whereas veillonella species, particularly veillonella dispar was associated with pulps. other bacteria detected in pulps included streptococcus mutans, parascardovia denticolens, bifidobacterium longum, and several lactobacillus and actinomyces species. by principal, component analysis pulp microbiotas grouped together, whereas those in caries biofilms were widely dispersed. conclusions: we conclude that the microbiota of cariously exposed vital primary pulps is composed of a subset of species associated with carious lesions. vital primary pulps had a dominant firmicutes and actinobacteria microbiota which contrasts with reports of endodontic infections which can harbor a gram-negative microbiota. the microbiota of exposed primary pulps may provide insight into bacterial species at the forefront of caries invasion in dentinal lesions that can invade into the pulp and the nature of species that need suppressing for successful pulp therapy.

TI  == the isolation of bifidobacteria from occlusal carious lesions in children and adults.
AB  == the aim of this study was to enumerate and identify bifidobacteria from occlusal  carious lesions in permanent and deciduous teeth. samples of infected dentine were obtained from 24 active occlusal lesions in deciduous teeth and from 15 occlusal lesions in permanent teeth. plaque samples from sound occlusal surfaces  of 12 caries-free adults and 12 children were also obtained. the bifidobacterial  strains were isolated in mupirocin-containing selective media, gram-stained and subcultured for identification. total bacterial counts were determined using fastidious anaerobic agar, and isolates were identified using genus-specific pcr  primers and were confirmed by 16s rrna sequencing. bifidobacteria were isolated from 13 of the 15 occlusal lesions in the adults and formed 5.09 +/- 2.11% of the total cultivable flora. in the children, bifidobacteria were isolated from 16 of  the 24 occlusal lesions and formed 7.4 +/- 2.6% of the total flora. no bifidobacteria were isolated from the occlusal surfaces of caries-free adults or  children. a total of 424 bifidobacteria were identified and these were bifidobacteriumdentium, parascardovia denticolens, scardoviainopicata, bifidobacterium longum, scardovia genomosp. c1 and bifidobacterium breve. b. dentium was present in 14 out of the 16 bifidobacteria-positive samples from the  lesions on the deciduous teeth and in 7 out of the 13 positive lesions in adults  (p = 0.04). the present data suggest that bifidobacteria may play a role in the progression of occlusal caries lesions in both children and adults.

TI  == isolation and identification of bifidobacteriaceae from human saliva.
AB  == bifidobacteriaceae were isolated from saliva and infected dentine by using a mupirocin-based selective medium. of the saliva samples, 94% harbored bifids. the mean concentration (+/- the standard error) was 4.46 (+/-0.12) log(10)(cfu per ml + 1), and the predominant isolates were bifidobacterium dentium, b. longum, scardovia inopinata, parascardovia denticolens, and alloscardovia omnicolens.
