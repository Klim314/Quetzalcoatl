TI  == bacteria community study of combined periodontal-endodontic lesions using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing analysis.
AB  == background: the entire microbial population and predominant microflora of root canals (rcs) and adjacent periodontal pockets (pps) from teeth with combined periodontal-endodontic lesions were determined and compared. methods: pooled rc and pp samples were collected from the molars of 20 patients diagnosed with combined periodontal-endodontic lesions. dna was extracted for polymerase chain reaction-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), cloning, and sequence analysis. a coefficient of similarity (cs) was used to determine the similarity of the bacterial profiles from rcs and pps. results: significantly fewer bands were produced by pcr-dgge from rcs (5.9 +/- 1.7) than from pps (8.0 +/- 1.8) (p <0.001). the average cs of the rc and pp samples was 93.81% +/- 10.26%. overall, 60 genera/species were identified by sequencing. of these, the predominant genera in rcs were porphyromonas sp. (13.9%), filifactor sp. (12.5%), and parvimonas sp. (11.1%), similar to the genera obtained from pp samples. in total, 43 genera/species were common to the rc and pp samples. the most prevalent bacteria in both the rc and pp samples were (in descending order) filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia. conclusions: the high similarity in the sets of organisms present in both rc and  pp samples in this study suggests that the pocket could be a source of rc infection. the data also demonstrate that combined periodontal-endodontic lesions consist of a diverse and complex microbial community.

TI  == clinical and microbiological results following nonsurgical periodontal therapy with or without local administration of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB  == objectives: we assessed if adjunct administration of piperacillin/tazobactam added clinical and microbiological treatment benefits. materials and methods: thirty-six subjects (mean age 52.1 years (sd +/- 10.3)) (ns by group) with chronic periodontitis were randomly enrolled receiving subgingival debridement and the local administration of piperacillin/tazobactam (test group) or debridement alone (control group). bleeding on probing (bop), probing pocket depth (ppd), and microbiological counts of 74 species were studied by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization up to month 6 after treatment. results: mean ppd changes between baseline and month 6 in the test and control groups were 1.5  and 1.8 mm, respectively (ns between groups). bop in both groups decreased from about 80 to 40 %. at 4 and 12 weeks, lower counts of the following bacteria were  found in the test group (site level): fusobacterium species, parvimonas micra, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and a composite load of nine pathogens (p < 0.001). at week 26, subjects receiving local antibiotics had a lower prevalence at tested sites for fusobacterium nucleatum sp. polymorphum, fusobacterium periodonticum, p. micra, and t. denticola. conclusions: at 26 weeks, treatment with or without piperacillin/tazobactam resulted in similar bop and ppd improvements. at week 26  and at the subject level, the prevalence of 4/74 pathogens was found at lower counts in the group receiving local antibiotics. clinical relevance: administration of piperacillin/tazobactam reduces the prevalence of fusobacterium, p. micra, and t. denticola to a greater extent than debridement alone but with no short-term differences in ppd or bop.

TI  == impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n  = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after  treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in  rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203,  pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia  dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated  with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI  == detection of periodontal pathogens in newborns and children with mixed dentition.
AB  == we report the age-related prevalence of red complex periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, along with four strains of orange complex pathogens. the bacteria present in samples isolated from tongue, cheek, and subgingival sulcus in edentulous newborns and children with mixed dentition were monitored by polymerase chain reaction (pcr).  p. gingivalis was not detected in any site of any subject in the two groups tested. however, t. denticola was not only found in the 6-13 years age group, but also in edentulous newborns at a relatively high prevalence, indicating non-dentition-related colonization by t. denticola. campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, eikenella corrodens, and parvimonas micra were found in the oral cavity of most subjects belonging to the 6-13 years age group compared to newborns. this suggested a pronounced association between these colonizing bacteria and the presence of teeth. there was also a strong relation between t. denticola and t. forsythia for their prevalence in the subgingival sulcus of the 6-13 years age group (p < 0.0001), but not in the other sites tested, suggesting that the colonization of dentition-related t. forsythia may be associated with the increased prevalence of non-dentition-related t. denticola in the subgingival sulcus. overall, these results suggest that dentition is a key determinant of bacterial colonization, especially orange complex bacteria and the red complex bacterium t. forsythia.

TI  == subgingival microbial profiles of smokers with periodontitis.
AB  == the subgingival microbiome is largely uncultivated, and therefore, cultivation-based and targeted molecular approaches have limited value in examining the effect of smoking on this community. we tested the hypothesis that  the subgingival biofilm is compositionally different in current and never-smokers by using an open-ended molecular approach for bacterial identification. subgingival plaque from deep sites of current and never-smokers matched for disease was analyzed by 16s sequencing. smokers demonstrated greater abundance of parvimonas, fusobacterium, campylobacter, bacteroides, and treponema and lower levels of veillonella, neisseria, and streptococcus. several uncultivated peptostreptococci, parvimonas micra, campylobacter gracilis, treponema socranskii, dialister pneumosintes, and tannerella forsythia were elevated in this group, while veillonella sp. oral clone b2, neisseria sp. oral clone 2.24, streptococcus sanguinis, and capnocytophaga sp. clone ah015 were at lower levels. the microbial profile of smoking-associated periodontitis is distinct from that of non-smokers, with significant differences in the prevalence and abundance of disease-associated and health-compatible organisms.

TI  == detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria in pregnant women by traditional anaerobic culture method and by a commercial molecular genetic method.
AB  == to culture facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria is a well-established method for analyzing subgingival plaque samples. micro-ident and micro-ident plus (hain  lifescience gmbh, nehren, germany) tests are two commercially available rapid pcr-based methods for the identification and quantification of putative periodontopathogen bacteria. in this study, we compared these commercial pcr-based hybridization methods with conventional anaerobic culture technique. a  total of 36 subgingival plaque samples were collected from periodontal pockets of pregnant women with chronic localized periodontitis. aliquots of these samples were evaluated with species-specific probes provided by micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests simultaneously, and from the same samples anaerobic and capnophylic bacteria were cultured on selective media. the overall agreement between both methods was excellent for eubacterium nodatum, tannerella forsythia  and porphyromonas gingivalis (97-92%), fair for capnocytophaga sp, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia (91-89%) and poor for fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra (micromonas micros), and campylobacter rectus (86-78%). discrepancies in the results may be explained by inability of culture method to distinguish between closely related taxa (e.i p. intermedia/prevotella. nigrescens), and problems of keeping periodontopathogen bacteria viable, which is required for successful detection by standard culture method. nucleic acid-based methods may replace cultivation method as frequently used methods in microbiological diagnosis of progressive periodontitis, thus micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests can be recommended where culture of periodontopathogenic bacteria is not performed in routine microbiology laboratories to analyze subgingival plaque samples.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI  == correlates of periodontal decline and biologic markers in older adults.
AB  == background: there is limited information on infectious and host responses distinguishing older people with or without active periodontitis. this study measured bacterial and serum cytokine and high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hscrp) levels in older persons. methods: elders (mean age: 67 years), whose periodontal status had declined most or least (20% worst or 20% best) over 5 years, were enrolled. two years later, they were classified as periodontally declining (active periodontitis [ap]), if they had at least five teeth with probing depth (pd) > or =5 mm, or stable (stable periodontally [sp]), if they did not. groups were compared with respect to demographics, pd, clinical loss of attachment, subgingival bacteria, serum hscrp, interleukin (il)-1beta and -6, and chronic diseases. results: ten ap and 24 sp subjects were identified; 13% of women and 44% of men from the original sample were in the ap group (p <0.05). most asians were sp; most whites and all african americans were classified as having ap (p <0.01). more ap elders had osteoporosis (p <0.01), but the ap and sp groups did not differ with respect to il-1beta and -6 or hscrp. bacterial counts  were higher in the ap group for parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros) (7.7 x 10(5) cells versus 3.8 x 10(5) cells; p <0.05), prevotella intermedia (25.7 x 10(5) cells versus 9.8 x 10(5) cells; p <0.01), tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (16.2 x 10(5) cells versus 8.0 x 10(5) cells; p <0.05), and streptococcus mutans (6.2 x 10(5) cells versus 2.0 x 10(5) cells; p <0.01). three risk factors were most predictive of periodontal decline: pd, osteoporosis, and being white or african american. conclusion: periodontal decline was associated with osteoporosis, ethnicity, pd,  gender, serum hscrp, and levels of four bacterial species.
