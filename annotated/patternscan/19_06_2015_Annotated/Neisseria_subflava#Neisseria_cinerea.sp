TI  == oropharyngeal colonization with neisseria lactamica, other nonpathogenic neisseria species and moraxella catarrhalis among young healthy children in ahvaz, iran.
AB  == background: neisseria lactamica as one of the main commensal in oropharynx during the childhood is related to the induction of a natural immunity against meningococcal meningitis. also moraxella catarrhalis in oropharynx of children is a predisposing factor for otitis media infection. objectives: the current study aimed to investigate the frequency of the n. lactamica, other nonpathogenic neisseria spp. and m. catarrhalis in the oropharynx of young healthy children in  ahvaz, iran by the two phenotypic tests and polymerase chain reaction (pcr). materials and methods: a total of 192 oropharyngeal swab samples of the young healthy children were studied during four months. swabs were plated onto enriched selective media and non-selective media. gram-negative and oxidase-positive diplococci were identified by several conventional biochemical tests. the pcr and sequencing were used to confirm the accuracy of laboratory diagnosis to identify  n. lactamica and m. catarrhalis. results: among 192 young healthy children with the mean age of 5.93 +/- 2.5903 years, authors identified: n. lactamica (21.9%) in the age group of one to nine years; n. mucosa (6.3%); n. sicca (7.8%); n. cinerea (1.6%); n. subflava (biovar subflava) (4.2%); n. subflava (biovar perflava) (28.1%); n. subflava (biovar flava) (7.3%) and m. catarrhalis (42.7%).  conclusions: the young healthy children screening by colonization of n. lactamica and other nonpathogenic neisseria spp. in oropharynx was the first report in ahvaz, iran. the study results demonstrated the high frequency of colonization of m. catarrhalis in the studied young healthy children other than neisseria spp.

TI  == [gene detection of neisseria spp. isolated from male patients with genitourinary  tract infections].
AB  == objective: to detect the genes of neisseria spp. isolated from patients with male genitourinary tract infections, and to study the pathogenicity of non-gonococcal  strains of neisseria and the laboratory diagnosis for the infections caused by neisseria spp. methods: using polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequencing, we amplified and sequenced 4 genes of neisseria spp. isolated from patients with male genitourinary tract infections, including 16s rrna, orfl, cppb and nspa. results: fourteen neisseria strains were identified through analysis of the 16s rrna gene, including 3 n. mucosa strains, 3 n. cinerea strains, 2 n. gonorrhoea strains, 2 n. sicca strains, 2 n. subflava strains, 1 n. lactamica strain, and 1 n. polysaccharea strain. among them, 9 showed positive results in gonococcal fluorescence-labeled multiplex-pcr detection, 1 in cppb gene reaction, 5 in orfl gene reaction, and 3 in nspa gene reaction. the consistency rate was 85.7% between the above results from our gene detection and those from the routine bacteriological methods. conclusion: the cppb gene is absent in the non-gonococcal strains of neisseria spp. that can cause male genitourinary tract  infection. most of the strains not only lack virulence-associated orfl and nspa genes, but also show positive results in gonococcal fluorescence-labeled multiplex-pcr detection, which is one of the important reasons for the misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis of gonorrhea infection. the combination of routine bacteriological methods and gene detection in laboratory examinations may help improve the accuracy rates of neisseria species identification and clinical  diagnosis of the infections caused by neisseria spp.

TI  == biochemical and genomic analysis of the denitrification pathway within the genus  neisseria.
AB  == since neisseria gonorrhoeae and neisseria meningitidis are obligate human pathogens, a comparison with commensal species of the same genus could reveal differences important in pathogenesis. the recent completion of commensal neisseria genome draft assemblies allowed us to perform a comparison of the genes involved in the catalysis, assembly and regulation of the denitrification pathway, which has been implicated in the virulence of several bacteria. all species contained a highly conserved nitric oxide reductase (norb) and a nitrite  reductase (ania or nirk) that was highly conserved in the catalytic but divergent in the n-terminal lipid modification and c-terminal glycosylation domains. only neisseria mucosa contained a nitrate reductase (nar), and only neisseria lactamica, neisseria cinerea, neisseria subflava, neisseria flavescens and neisseria sicca contained a nitrous oxide reductase (nos) complex. the regulators of the denitrification genes, fnr, narqp and nsrr, were highly conserved, except  for the gaf domain of narq. biochemical examination of laboratory strains revealed that all of the neisserial species tested except n. mucosa had a two- to fourfold lower nitrite reductase activity than n. gonorrhoeae, while n. meningitidis and most of the commensal neisseria species had a two- to fourfold higher nitric oxide (no) reductase activity. for n. meningitidis and most of the  commensal neisseria, there was a greater than fourfold reduction in the no steady-state level in the presence of nitrite as compared with n. gonorrhoeae. all of the species tested generated an no steady-state level in the presence of an no donor that was similar to that of n. gonorrhoeae. the greatest difference between the neisseria species was the lack of a functional nos system in the pathogenic species n. gonorrhoeae and n. meningitidis.

TI  == distribution of transferrin binding protein b gene (tbpb) variants among neisseria species.
AB  == background: transferrin binding protein b (tbpb), an outer membrane lipoprotein,  is required for the acquisition of iron from human transferrin. two tbpb families have been documented in neisseria meningitidis: an isotype i tbpb gene of 1.8 kb  and an isotype ii tbpb gene of 2.1 kb, the former expressed by meningococci in the disease-associated st-11 clonal complex and the latter found among meningococci belonging to the hyper-invasive clonal complexes including st-8, st-18, st-32, st-41/44 as well as n. gonorrhoeae isolates. the origin of the isotype i tbpb gene is unknown, however several features in common with non-pathogenic neisseria and the st-11 clonal complex n. meningitidis isolate fam18 have been documented leading to the hypothesis that the isotype i tbpb gene may also be shared between non-pathogenic neisseria and st-11 meningococci. as a  result, the diversity of the tbpb gene was investigated in a defined collection of neisseria species. results: two families of isotype i tbpb were identified: family a containing conserved genes belonging to st-11 meningococci, n. polysaccharea and n. lactamica isolates and family b including more diverse isotype i tbpb genes from n. sicca, n. mucosa, n. flava, n. subflava as well as n. cinerea, n. flavescens and n. polysaccharea isolates. three isotype ii tbpb families were identified with: family c containing diverse tbpb genes belonging to n. polysaccharea, n. lactamica, n. gonorrhoeae and n. meningitidis isolates, family d including another subset of isotype ii tbpb genes from n. lactamica isolates and family e solely composed of n. gonorrhoeae tbpb genes. conclusion: this study reveals another instance of similarity between meningococci of the st-11 clonal complex and non-pathogenic neisseria with the origin of the isotype  i tbpb gene resulting from a horizontal genetic transfer event occurring between  these two populations.

TI  == variations in gene organization and dna uptake signal sequence in the folp region between commensal and pathogenic neisseria species.
AB  == background: horizontal gene transfer is an important source of genetic variation  among neisseria species and has contributed to the spread of resistance to penicillin and sulfonamide drugs in the pathogen neisseria meningitidis. sulfonamide resistance in neisseria meningitidis is mediated by altered chromosomal folp genes. at least some folp alleles conferring resistance have been horizontally acquired from other species, presumably from commensal neisseriae. in this work, the dna sequence surrounding folp in commensal neisseria species was determined and compared to corresponding regions in pathogenic neisseriae, in order to elucidate the potential for inter-species dna  transfer within this region. results: the upstream region of folp displayed differences in gene order between species, including an insertion of a complete correia element in neisseria lactamica and an inversion of a larger genomic segment in neisseria sicca, neisseria subflava and neisseria mucosa. the latter species also had dna uptake signal sequences (dus) in this region that were one base different from the dus in pathogenic neisseriae. another interesting finding was evidence of a horizontal transfer event from neisseria lactamica or neisseria cinerea that introduced a novel folp allele to the meningococcal population. conclusion: genetic recombination events immediately upstream of folp and horizontal transfer have resulted in sequence differences in the folp region between the neisseria species. this variability could be a consequence of the selective pressure on this region exerted by the use of sulfonamide drugs.

TI  == functional diversity of three different dsba proteins from neisseria meningitidis.
AB  == the genome of neisseria meningitidis serogroup b strain mc58 contains three genes - nmb0278, nmb0294 and nmb0407 - encoding putative homologues of dsba, a periplasmic thiol disulphide oxidoreductase protein-folding catalyst of the dsb protein family. dsba assists the folding of periplasmic and membrane proteins in  diverse organisms. while all three cloned genes complemented the dtt sensitivity  of dsba-null escherichia coli, they showed different activities in folding specific target proteins in this background. nmb0278 protein was the most active  in complementing defects in motility and alkaline phosphatase activity, while nmb0294 was the most active in folding periplasmic malf. nmb0407 showed the weakest activity in all assays. it is extremely unusual for organisms to contain  more than one chromosomal dsba. among the members of the genus neisseria, only the meningococcus carries all three of these genes. strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria lactamica, neisseria cinerea and neisseria polysaccharea contained only homologues of nmb0278 and nmb0407, while neisseria flava, neisseria subflava and neisseria flavescens carried only nmb0294. it is speculated that the versatility of the meningococcus in surviving in different colonizing and invasive disease settings may be derived in part from an enhanced  potential to deploy outer-membrane proteins, a consequence of carrying an extended repertoire of protein-folding catalysts.

TI  == an assessment of the roche amplicor chlamydia trachomatis/neisseria gonorrhoeae multiplex pcr assay in routine diagnostic use on a variety of specimen types.
AB  == the roche cobas amplicor chlamydia trachomatis/neisseria gonorrhoeae polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay can simultaneously detect both c. trachomatis and n. gonorrhoeae, and has been cleared by united states food and drug administration (fda) for the testing of endocervical and urethral swabs and urine specimens. the amplicor n. gonorrhoeae pcr target sequence is known to be present in some strains of commensal neisseria species, including n. cinerea and n. subflava, necessitating the use of a second pcr assay to confirm positive results. this study analyses the performance of the assay on 7,007 unselected specimens submitted to the laboratory for the pcr diagnosis of n. gonorrhoeae and c. trachomatis; compares the pcr assay with culture for the detection of n. gonorrhoeae; examines the performance of the assay with specimens from different  body sites; and briefly compares two confirmatory pcr assays. confirmation rates  for an initial amplicor n. gonorrhoeae positive result varied widely by specimen  type, ranging from 86.2 per cent for penile/urethral swabs to 5.6 per cent for oropharyngeal swabs, indicating all positive amplicor n. gonorrhoeae results should be confirmed by a second method to maintain adequate specificity. overall  there was 98.1 per cent agreement between the confirmed pcr assay and culture, with confirmed pcr showing a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value  (ppv) and negative predictive value (npv) of 81.7 per cent, 99.5 per cent, 92.7 per cent and 98.5 per cent respectively, compared with n. gonorrhoeae culture. when confirmed c. trachomatis/n. gonorrhoeae pcr assay performance was analysed against culture using only fda-cleared specimens (553 penile/ urethral swabs, urines and cervical/vaginal swabs), sensitivity, specificity, ppv and npv and percent agreement were 96.7 per cent, 99.8 per cent, 98.9 per cent, 99.4 per cent and 99.3 per cent respectively. no significant differences were found between the two confirmatory pcr assays used during the study period. limitations of amplicor for the detection of n. gonorrhoeae and the appropriate use of combined c. trachomatis/n. gonorrhoeae pcr in a routine diagnostic setting are discussed.

TI  == the integration site of the iga gene in commensal neisseria sp.
AB  == an iga1 protease is produced by the human pathogens neisseria gonorrhoeae and n.  meningitidis but not by related non-pathogenic, commensal, neisseria species. in  this study, the chromosomal iga locus was characterized in the n. gonorrhoeae strain ms11 and compared to corresponding loci in n. meningitidis and commensal neisseria species. in n. gonorrhoeae, the genes trpb and ksga were found immediately downstream of iga. in addition to coml and coma, a homolog of the escherichia coli yfii gene was identified upstream of iga. each gene in the iga region (yfii and coml, coma and iga, and trpb and ksga) is transcribed in the opposite direction to its neighbors. the coml/ coma and iga/ trpb pairs each have a transcriptional terminator in the correct position for joint use. these terminators contain the common gonococcal dna uptake sequence (dus). a highly conserved direct repeat of 25 bp located immediately adjacent to the iga gene in  n. gonorrhoeae was also found in n. meningitidis. in southern hybridization experiments, no homology to iga was detectable in the chromosomal dnas of the commensal species n. mucosa, n. lactamica, n. flavescens, n. cinerea, n. subflava, n. flava, n. sicca or n. elongata. when n. gonorrhoeae coml and trpb were used as probes, signals were detected on the same restriction fragment in six of the eight species. this indicated that commensal neisseria species share a possible integration site for the iga gene between coma and trpb. the region between coma and trpb was therefore amplified by pcr. the fragment obtained from  n. lactamica showed a high degree of homology to gonococcal coma and trpb, respectively, but iga was replaced by a sequence of 13 bp that shows no homology  to any known gonococcal sequence. our data suggest that iga was acquired by a common ancestor of n. gonorrhoeae and n. meningitidis rather than being distributed by horizontal gene transfer. n. lactamica, which is more closely related to n. gonorrhoeae than other commensals, may have lost iga by deletion.

TI  == degradation of heme in gram-negative bacteria: the product of the hemo gene of neisseriae is a heme oxygenase.
AB  == a full-length heme oxygenase gene from the gram-negative pathogen neisseria meningitidis was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. expression of the enzyme yielded soluble catalytically active protein and caused accumulation of biliverdin within the e. coli cells. the purified hemo forms a 1:1 complex with heme and has a heme protein spectrum similar to that previously reported for the  purified heme oxygenase (hmuo) from the gram-positive pathogen corynebacterium diphtheriae and for eukaryotic heme oxygenases. the overall sequence identity between hemo and these heme oxygenases is, however, low. in the presence of ascorbate or the human nadph cytochrome p450 reductase system, the heme-hemo complex is converted to ferric-biliverdin ixalpha and carbon monoxide as the final products. homologs of the hemo gene were identified and characterized in six commensal neisseria isolates, neisseria lactamica, neisseria subflava, neisseria flava, neisseria polysacchareae, neisseria kochii, and neisseria cinerea. all hemo orthologs shared between 95 and 98% identity in amino acid sequences with functionally important residues being completely conserved. this is the first heme oxygenase identified in a gram-negative pathogen. the identification of hemo as a heme oxygenase provides further evidence that oxidative cleavage of the heme is the mechanism by which some bacteria acquire iron for further use.

TI  == evaluation of amplicor neisseria gonorrhoeae pcr using cppb nested pcr and 16s rrna pcr.
AB  == certain strains of neisseria subflava and neisseria cinerea are known to produce  false-positive results with the amplicor neisseria gonorrhoeae pcr (roche diagnostic systems, branchburg, n.j.). the analytical sensitivity and analytical  specificity of three pcr tests were assessed with 3 geographically diverse n. gonorrhoeae strains and 30 non-n. gonorrhoeae neisseria spp. the sensitivities of the in-house nested cppb gene and the 16s rrna pcr methods were greater than that of the amplicor n. gonorrhoeae pcr with purified dna from all 3 n. gonorrhoeae strains. six of 14 clinical strains of n. subflava (1 from a vaginal swab, 5 from respiratory sites) produced false-positive amplicor n. gonorrhoeae pcr results and were negative by the two other pcr methods. when applied to 207 clinical specimens selected from a population with a high prevalence ( approximately 9%) of infection, the results for 15 of 96 (15.6%) amplicor-positive specimens and 14 of 17 (82.3%) amplicor-equivocal specimens were not confirmed by the more sensitive nested cppb pcr method. only 2 of 94 (2.1%) of amplicor n. gonorrhoeae  pcr-negative specimens from the same population tested positive by the nested cppb method. these results suggest that for this population the amplicor n. gonorrhoeae pcr test is suitable as a screening test only and all positive results should be confirmed by a pcr method that is more specific and at least as sensitive. this study also illustrates that caution should be used when introducing commercially available nucleic acid amplification-based diagnostic tests into the regimens of tests used for populations not previously tested with  these products.

TI  == neisseria gonorrhoeae : detection and typing by probe hybridization, lcr, and pcr.
AB  == neisseria gonorrhoeae, first described by neisser in 1879, is a gram-negative, nonmotile, nonspore-forming diplococcus, belonging to the family neisseriaceae. it is the etiologic agent of gonorrhea. the other pathogenic species is neisseria meningitidis, to which n. gonorrhoeae is genetically closely related. although n. meningitidis is not usually considered to be a sexually transmitted disease, it may infect the mucous membranes of the anogenital area of homosexual men (1). the other members of the genus, which include neisseria lactamic a, neisseriapolysaccharea, neisseria cinerea, and neisseria flavescens, which are related to neisseria gonorrhoeae, and saccharolytic strains, such as neisseria subflava, neisseria sicca, and neisseria mucosa, which are less genetically related to the aforementioned, are considered to be nonpathogenic, being normal flora of the nasopharyngeal mucous membranes (2).

TI  == a numerical phenotypic taxonomic study of the genus neisseria.
AB  == a numerical phenotypic taxonomic study of 315 strains of neisseria and some allied bacteria examined for 155 phenotypic tests showed 31 groups, most of which were reasonably distinct. these fell into four major areas. areas a, b and c contained species of neisseria, whereas area d contained the organisms known as 'false neisserias' together with branhamella, moraxella and kingella species. area a contained n. gonorrhoeae (which showed two subgroups), n. meningitidis (with two subgroups, and n. cinerea closely associated), n. polysaccharea, n. elongata subsp, glycolytica and n. lactamica. area b contained mainly organisms from the human nasopharynx, and the nine groups were not very distinct: only three, n. mucosa, n. perflava and n. sicca could be recognized by the presence of type strains, and there was little relationship between taxonomic position and species epithets. area c contained several groups from animals, n. animalis, n. canis and two phenons that may be justified as new species of neisseria, one from lizards and the other from dental plaque of herbivores. area c also contained n.  elongata, n. subflava (with n. flavescens), type strain of morococcus cerebrosis  and the cdc groups m-5 (n. weaveri) and ef-4. area d contained branhamella catarrhalis, a combined group which consists of strains of the 'false neisserias' n. caviae and n. cuniculi, the 'false neisseria' n. ovis, and a group of moraxella strains. a small group representing kingella kingae is included in area d. mean test error was 1.7%.

TI  == detection of the tetm determinant in neisseria gonorrhoeae using a non-radioactively labelled oligonucleotide probe.
AB  == three oligonucleotide probes, complementary to tetm sequences, were labelled non-radiometrically using the dig-oligonucleotide tailing kit and evaluated for their specificity for the detection of plasmid mediated tetracycline resistance in neisseria gonorrhoeae. only probe 3, 5'-gct caa caa ttc tgt tcc agc-3', was specific for tetm. it hybridized with the tetm-containing 25.2-mda plasmids from  all of the 232 trng and the 130 pp/trng isolates used in the study. its sensitivity, determined by dot-blot hybridization, was 0.1 pg of pj13 plasmid dna or 10(4) cells. it did not hybridize with the dna from non-ppng, cmrng and tetracycline susceptible isolates from seven other neisseria species (n. meningitidis, n. subflava, n. cinerea, n. lactamica, n. sicca, n. mucosa, and n.  flavescens), moraxella spp. and haemophilus influenzae. probe 3 also hybridized to dna of three tetracycline resistant p. magnus (mic = 16 micrograms ml-1) isolates which presumptively carried the tetm determinant. therefore, probe 3 can be used by reference laboratories as a confirmatory test for trng, as well as isolates from other genera containing the tetm determinant.

TI  == genetic diversity of the iron-binding protein (fbp) gene of the pathogenic and commensal neisseria.
AB  == the pathogenic neisseria and most commensal neisseria species produce an iron-binding protein (fbp) when grown under iron-limited conditions. in the current study, we confirmed the presence of fbp, as well as dna sequences homologous to the gonococcal fbp, in strains of n. gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis,  n. cinerea, n. lactamica, n. subflava, n. kochii and n. polysaccharea. the fbp genes from these strains were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, digested with stui or rsai, and the restriction patterns examined. the patterns for the gonococcal and meningococcal fbp were virtually identical; however, variations were observed in the fbp sequences of the commensal neisseria species. n. flavescens, n. mucosa, n. sicca, n. ovis and branhamella catarrhalis, did not  produce fbp as detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and reactivity with an fbp specific monoclonal antibody, nor did  they hybridize to an fbp-specific dna probe.

TI  == distribution of a protein antigenically related to the major anaerobically induced gonococcal outer membrane protein among other neisseria species.
AB  == the pan 1 protein of neisseria gonorrhoeae is a novel 54-kda outer membrane protein expressed only when gonococci are grown in the absence of oxygen. it is a major antigen recognized by sera from patients with gonococcal infection. we raised mouse monospecific polyclonal antiserum to gel-purified pan 1 from gonococcal strain f62. the antiserum was broadly cross-reactive among gonococcal  strains; all strains tested reacted in immunoblot analysis proportionate to the amount of pan 1 visible in silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds)-polyacrylamide gels. in immunoblot experiments, n. lactamica and n. cinerea reacted very strongly to the anti-pan 1 antiserum, whereas n. sicca, n. flava, and n. mucosa did not react at all. the other commensals tested, n. subflava and  n. perflava, exhibited only a minor reaction. these results correlated with the apparent amount of pan 1 seen on sds-polyacrylamide gels of outer membranes. sds-polyacrylamide gel analysis of six meningococcal strains revealed no visible  anaerobically induced outer membrane proteins, and the subsequent immunoblots showed only slight or no reaction to the anti-pan 1 antibody. in the four meningococcal strains that did react slightly with the antiserum, a pan 1-like protein was seen only in anaerobically grown cells. thus, meningococci did not express pan 1 at levels comparable to that found in gonococci; however, when pan  1 was expressed in meningococcal strains, it was oxygen regulated. this is the first example of a protein found in the gonococcal outer membrane that, under identical growth conditions, is not expressed at similar levels in the meningococcus.

TI  == evaluation of eight methods for identification of pathogenic neisseria species: neisseria-kwik, rim-n, gonobio-test, minitek, gonochek ii, gonogen, phadebact monoclonal gc omni test, and syva microtrak test.
AB  == the performance of eight methods in identifying neisseria species, particularly n. gonorrhoeae, was evaluated. these methods included four rapid carbohydrate utilization tests (gonobio-test, neisseria-kwik, rim-n, and minitek); the gonochek ii, a test which is based on the utilization of chromogenic substrates;  and three monoclonal antibody tests (syva microtrak, gonogen, and phadebact monoclonal gc omni test). in all, 182 isolates comprised in six species of neisseria as well as branhamella catarrhalis and moraxella sp. were tested. cystine-tryptic digest agar supplemented with sugars was included for reference purposes. in the carbohydrate utilization tests, the sensitivity and specificity  of the neisseria-kwik and minitek tests for the identification of n. gonorrhoeae  were 100%. this compared with sensitivities and specificities, respectively, of 100 and 99.1% for the gonobio-test and 99.1 and 100% for cystine-tryptic digest agar sugars and the rim-n test. the sensitivity and specificity of the gonochek ii test were 99.0 and 86.7%, respectively. although most test kits did not claim  to identify all neisseria species, in several cases isolates of n. subflava were  misidentified or could be misinterpreted as n. gonorrhoeae or n. meningitidis. with the monoclonal reagents, the syva microtrak system was 100% sensitive and 100% specific. the gonogen test was both 99.1% sensitive and specific, while the  phadebact monoclonal gc omni test was 99.1% sensitive but 91.2% specific. with this latter test, cross-reactions were observed with strains of b. catarrhalis, n. cinerea, and n. lactamica.

TI  == distribution of an antigenically related iron-regulated protein among the neisseria spp.
AB  == several iron-regulated proteins of neisseria gonorrhoeae have been reported. one  of these, a 37,000-molecular-weight protein (37k protein), appears to be common to all gonococcal isolates. recently, the occurrence of a similar protein has also been noted in n. meningitidis. the gonococcal 37k protein has been purified  and used to produce both rabbit monospecific antiserum and murine monoclonal antibodies. using these antibody reagents, we analyzed 57 strains from nine species of neisseria and the closely related organism branhamella catarrhalis for the presence of proteins antigenically related to the gonococcal 37k protein. strains grown on medium with low iron content were probed for antigenic reactivity by western blot techniques and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. proteins which cross-reacted with the rabbit monospecific antiserum were designated as agr-37k proteins. the data indicated that the agr-37k proteins were conserved among the 40 strains of n. gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, n. lactamica,  and n. cinerea tested. seventeen strains from other species of neisseria and branhamella did not express agr-37k proteins with the exception of one n. subflava isolate. all agr-37k proteins appeared to be regulated by the amount of  available iron in the growth medium. murine monoclonal antibodies were used to probe the antigenic heterogeneity of the agr-37k proteins from different neisseria spp. two of seven monoclonal antibodies were broadly cross-reactive, recognizing the agr-37k proteins from all species examined. the remaining five monoclonal antibodies were more discriminating, recognizing the agr-37k proteins  from certain species. the antigenic conservation of these agr-37k proteins, particularly among the pathogenic members of the genus neisseria, may imply that  these proteins serve a common function in pathogenicity.

TI  == conjugation of plasmids of neisseria gonorrhoeae to other neisseria species: potential reservoirs for the beta-lactamase plasmid.
AB  == the discovery that penicillinase production in neisseria gonorrhoeae was plasmid  mediated and the spread of the beta-lactamase encoding plasmids in gonococcal isolates since 1976, raise the possibility that a nonpathogenic indigenous bacterium could serve as a reservoir for these plasmids. we initiated studies to  define the ability of commensal neisseria species and branhamella catarrhalis strains, as well as strains of the pathogen neisseria meningitidis, to serve as recipients in conjugation with neisseria gonorrhoeae. we found that with n. gonorrhoeae as the donor, 3 of 5 neisseria cinerea, 2 of 5 neisseria flava, 0 of  1 neisseria flavescens, 1 of 3 neisseria subflava, 0 of 6 b. catarrhalis, 0 of 7  neisseria lactamica, 1 of 5 neisseria mucosa, 1 of 7 neisseria perflava/sicca, and 0 of 13 n. meningitidis strains gave detectable conjugation frequencies (greater than 10(-8). n. cinerea was the only species found to maintain the gonococcal conjugal plasmid (ple2451). a n. cinerea transconjugant containing ple2451 was observed to transfer both the beta-lactamase plasmid and ple2451 to n. gonorrhoeae at high frequency.

AB  == the catabolism of glutamate and fumarate was studied by radiorespirometry in selected neisseria species. the tricarboxylic acid cycle is functioning in all species tested, in spite of the known absence of in vitro malate dehydrogenase activity in n. meningitidis, n. gonorrhoeae and n. cinerea. the results imply a pyridine nucleotide independent oxidation of malate. the oxidation of glutamate is less complete in the presence of phosphate. in n. meningitidis, n. perflava, n. flava, n. subflava and n. lactamica the catabolism of fumarate was slow and incomplete in the absence of glutamate.

TI  == [isolation and identification of neisseria in bronchial asthma].
AB  == a study was made of 29 strains of neisseria isolated from the mucosa of the pharynx and the bronchi of patients suffering from infectious-allergic bronchial  asthma of different severity. comparison of the strains by 22 tests (including the assessment of the morphological, biochemical and other signs) permitted to establish the species of neisseria with some probability. the species reference was determined in 23 cultures. n. perflava was isolated in 10 cases, n. subflava--in 6, n. flava--in 3 cases and n. sicca--in 4 cases, 2 strains corresponded to apigmentary n. cinerea. the species was not established in 4 cultures. there was found no connection between a definite microbial association  and the species of neisseria and the severity of the disease. pigment species of  neisseria should be tested as diagnostic allergens.
