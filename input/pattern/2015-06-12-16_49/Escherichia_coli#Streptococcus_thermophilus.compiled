TI  - Impact of Cell-free Supernatant of Lactic Acid Bacteria on Putrescine and Other Polyamine Formation by Foodborne Pathogens in Ornithine Decarboxylase Broth.
AB  - Conversion of ornithine to putrescine by Salmonella Paratyphi A, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli was investigated in ornithine decarboxylase broth (ODB) using cell-free supernatants (CFSs) obtained from Leuconostoc mesenterodies subsp. cremoris, Pediococcus acidilactici, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus. Two groups of cell-free supernatants (25 or 50%) and control (only ODB) were prepared to investigate putrescine (PUT) and other polyamine formation by foodborne pathogens (FBPs). Significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed among the species for each amine. All of the CFSs reduced the formation of PUT by >/=65%. The production of cadaverine (CAD) was scarcely affected by the presence of CFSs, with the exception of the samples inoculated with L. monocytogenes. The variation in polyamine was found with respect to the control samples. Spermidine (SPD) was produced in lower amount in many samples, especially in Gram-negative FBPs, whereas spermine (SPN) increased drastically in the major part of the samples concerning the control. Histamine (HIS) was characterized by a marked concentration decrease in all of the samples, and tyramine (TYR) was accumulated in very low concentrations in the controls. Therefore, the ability of bacteria to produce certain biogenic amines such as HIS, TYR, PUT, and CAD has been studied to assess their risk and prevent their formation in food products. The results obtained from this study concluded that the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains with non-decarboxylase activity are capable of avoiding or limiting biogenic amine formation by FBP.
TI  - Proteolytic and antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria grown in goat milk.
AB  - We examined 62 strains and 21 trade starter cultures from the collection of LB Bulgaricum PLC for proteolytic and antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) grown in goat milk. The aim of this study was to investigate the fermentation of caseins, alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin by LAB, using the o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) spectrophotometric assay and sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The proteolysis targeted mainly caseins, especially beta-casein. Whey proteins were proteolyzed, essentially beta-lactoglobulin. The proteolytic activity of Lactococcus lactis l598, Streptococcus thermophilus t3D1, Dt1, Lactobacillus lactis 1043 and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus b38, b122 and b24 was notably high. The proteolysis process gave rise to medium-sized peptide populations. Most of the examined strains showed antimicrobial activity against some food pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella cholere enteridis, Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua and Enterobacter aerogenes. The most active producers of antimicrobial-active peptides were strains of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus, which are of practical importance. The starter cultures containing the examined species showed high proteolytic and antimicrobial activity in skimmed goat milk. The greatest antimicrobial activity of the cultures was detected against E. aerogenes. The obtained results demonstrated the significant proteolytic potential of the examined strains in goat milk and their potential for application in the production of dairy products from goat's milk. The present results could be considered as the first data on the proteolytic capacity of strains and starter cultures in goat milk for the purposes of trade interest of LB Bulgaricum PLC.
TI  - Assembling the Streptococcus thermophilus clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) array for multiplex DNA targeting.
AB  - In addition to the advantages of scalable, affordable, and easy to engineer, the  clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) technology is superior for multiplex targeting, which is laborious and inconvenient when achieved by cloning multiple gRNA expressing cassettes. Here, we report a simple CRISPR array assembling method which will facilitate multiplex targeting usage. First, the Streptococcus thermophilus CRISPR3/Cas locus was cloned. Second, different CRISPR arrays were assembled with different crRNA spacers. Transformation assays using different Escherichia coli strains demonstrated efficient plasmid DNA targeting, and we achieved targeting efficiency up to 95% with an assembled CRISPR array with three crRNA spacers.
TI  - Construction and validation of a mCherry protein vector for promoter analysis in  Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Lactobacilli are widespread in natural environments and are increasingly being investigated as potential health modulators. In this study, we have adapted the broad-host-range vector pNZ8048 to express the mCherry protein (pRCR) to expand the usage of the mCherry protein for analysis of gene expression in Lactobacillus. This vector is also able to replicate in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. The usage of pRCR as a promoter probe was validated in Lactobacillus acidophilus by characterizing the regulation of lactacin B expression. The results show that the regulation is exerted at the transcriptional level, with lbaB gene expression being specifically induced by co-culture of the L. acidophilus bacteriocin producer and the S. thermophilus STY-31 inducer bacterium.
TI  - The influence of the cell free solution of lactic acid bacteria on tyramine production by food borne-pathogens in tyrosine decarboxylase broth.
AB  - The function of cell-free solutions (CFSs) of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on tyramine and other biogenic amine production by different food borne-pathogens (FBPs) was investigated in tyrosine decarboxylase broth (TDB) using HPLC. Cell free solutions were prepared from four LAB strains. Two different concentrations which were 50% (5 ml CFS+5 ml medium/1:1) and 25% (2.5 ml CFS+7.5 ml medium/1:3) CFS and the control without CFS were prepared. Both concentration of CFS of Streptococcus thermophilus and 50% CFS of Pediococcus acidophilus inhibited tyramine production up to 98% by Salmonella paratyphi A. Tyramine production by Escherichia coli was also inhibited by 50% CFS of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and 25% CFS of Leuconostoc lactis. subsp. cremoris. The inhibitor effect of 50% CFS of P. acidophilus was the highest on tyramine production (55%) by Listeria monocytogenes, following Lc. lactis subsp. lactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris (20%) whilst 25% CFS of Leu. mes. subsp. cremoris and Lc. lactis subsp. lactis showed stimulator effects (160%). The stimulation effects of 50% CFS of S. thermophilus and Lc. lactis subsp. lactis were more than 70% by Staphylococcus aureus comparing to the control. CFS of LAB strains showed statistically inhibitor effect since lactic acid inhibited microbial growth, decreased pH quickly and reduced the formation of AMN and BAs. Consequently, in order to avoid the formation of high concentrations of biogenic amines in fermented food by bacteria, it is advisable to use CFS for food and food products.
TI  - Programmable RNA shredding by the type III-A CRISPR-Cas system of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Immunity against viruses and plasmids provided by CRISPR-Cas systems relies on a  ribonucleoprotein effector complex that triggers the degradation of invasive nucleic acids (NA). Effector complexes of type I (Cascade) and II (Cas9-dual RNA) target foreign DNA. Intriguingly, the genetic evidence suggests that the type III-A Csm complex targets DNA, whereas biochemical data show that the type III-B Cmr complex cleaves RNA. Here we aimed to investigate NA specificity and mechanism of CRISPR interference for the Streptococcus thermophilus Csm (III-A) complex (StCsm). When expressed in Escherichia coli, two complexes of different stoichiometry copurified with 40 and 72 nt crRNA species, respectively. Both complexes targeted RNA and generated multiple cuts at 6 nt intervals. The Csm3 protein, present in multiple copies in both Csm complexes, acts as endoribonuclease. In the heterologous E. coli host, StCsm restricts MS2 RNA phage in a Csm3 nuclease-dependent manner. Thus, our results demonstrate that the type III-A StCsm complex guided by crRNA targets RNA and not DNA.
TI  - New supramolecular metallo-terpyridine carboxymethyl cellulose derivatives with antimicrobial properties.
AB  - Preparation of a new water-soluble, cellulose derivative via a supramolecular route is presented. In a one-step procedure, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) was reacted with the Cu(BF4)2 complex of 4'-chloro[2,2':6',2'']terpyridine to generate the desired CMC-Cu(II)-terpyridine derivative. This polymeric salt was characterized by elemental analysis, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-visible), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), rheological properties measurements, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA), and tensile strength properties testing. In addition, antimicrobial properties were demonstrated against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus thermophilus), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli), and yeast (Saccharomyces cervisiae). The minimum inhibitory concentration of the prepared metallo-terpyridine CMC derivative against the studied microorganisms ranged from 6 to 8 mg/L to achieve >/=90% of microbial growth inhibition.
TI  - Use of probiotics to reduce faecal shedding of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia  coli in sheep.
AB  - Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are zoonotic, foodborne pathogens of humans. Ruminants, including sheep, are the primary reservoirs of STEC and there is a need to develop intervention strategies to reduce the entry of STEC into the food chain. The initiation of the majority of bacterial, enteric infections involves colonisation of the gut mucosal surface by the pathogen. However, probiotic bacteria can serve to decrease the severity of infection via a number of mechanisms including competition for receptors and nutrients, and/or the synthesis of organic acids and bacteriocins that create an environment unfavourable for pathogen development. The aim of the current study was to determine whether the administration of a probiotic mixture to sheep experimentally infected with a non-O157 STEC strain, carrying stx1, stx2 and eae genes, was able to decrease faecal shedding of the pathogen. The probiotic mixture contained Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Enterococcus faecium. The numbers of non-O157 STEC in faecal samples collected from sheep receiving daily doses of the probiotic mixture were significantly lower at the 3rd, 5th and 6th week post-inoculation when compared to the levels recorded in untreated animals. It was concluded that administration of the probiotic mixture reduced faecal shedding of non-O157 STEC in sheep, and holds potential as a pre-harvest intervention method to reduce transmission to humans.
TI  - Effectiveness of an association of a cranberry dry extract, D-mannose, and the two microorganisms Lactobacillus plantarum LP01 and Lactobacillus paracasei LPC09 in women affected by cystitis: a pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infection in women. Most UTIs are acute uncomplicated cystitis caused by Escherichia coli (86%). This study was undertaken to assess the effectiveness of an association of a cranberry dry extract, D-mannose, a gelling complex composed of the exopolysaccharides produced by Streptococcus thermophilus ST10 (DSM 25246) and tara gum, as well as the 2 microorganisms Lactobacillus plantarum LP01 (LMG P-21021) and Lactobacillus paracasei LPC09 (DSM 24243) in women affected by acute uncomplicated cystitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-three premenopausal, nonpregnant women diagnosed with acute uncomplicated cystitis were enrolled in a pilot prospective study and completed the treatment protocol. Subjects were instructed to take 2 doses per day during the first month, and then to continue with 1 sachet per day until the sixtieth day. Nitrites and leukocyte esterase on urine dipstick testing were used as indicators of cystitis, with analysis performed at enrollment, after 30 and 60 days, and after 1 month of follow-up. Typical UTI symptoms, namely dysuria, frequent voiding of small volumes, urinary urgency, suprapubic pain, and gross hematuria were scored 0 to 3 and evaluated at each visit. RESULTS: Positive results for the presence of nitrites and leukocyte esterase were found in 14 and 20 subjects after 30 days and in 9 and 14 women after 60 days, respectively (P<0.001). At the end of the follow-up period, positive results for nitrites and leukocyte esterase were recorded in only 4 and 3 of 24 and 19 subjects (16.7%, P=0.103; 15.8%, P=0.325, respectively), with negative results after 60 days. Typical symptoms of cystitis, specifically dysuria, frequent voiding, urgency, and suprapubic pain were significantly improved as well. No significant differences were recorded in the incidence and severity of hematuria at any visit. CONCLUSION: The long-term ability of an association of cranberry, D-mannose, an innovative gelling complex, and the 2 microorganisms tested to significantly improve the uncomfortable symptoms reported by women with acute cystitis has been suggested.
TI  - Experimental study on the optimization of general conditions for a free-flow electrophoresis device with a thermoelectric cooler.
AB  - With a given free-flow electrophoresis device, reasonable conditions (electric field strength, carrier buffer conductivity, and flow rate) are crucial for an optimized separation. However, there has been no experimental study on how to choose reasonable general conditions for a free-flow electrophoresis device with a thermoelectric cooler in view of Joule heat generation. Herein, comparative experiments were carried out to propose the selection procedure of general conditions in this study. The experimental results demonstrated that appropriate conditions were (i) <67 V/cm electric field strength; (ii) lower than 1.3 mS/cm carrier buffer conductivity (Tris-HCl: 20 mM Tris was titrated by HCl to pH 8.0); and (iii) higher than 3.6 mL/min carrier buffer flow rate. Furthermore, under inappropriate conditions (e.g. 400 V voltage and 40 mM Tris-HCl carrier buffer), the free-flow electrophoresis separation would be destroyed by bubbles caused by more Joule heating. Additionally, a series of applications under the appropriate conditions were performed with samples of model dyes, proteins (bovine serum albumin, myoglobin, and cytochrome c), and cells (Escherichia coli, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The separation results showed that under the appropriate conditions, separation efficiency was obviously better than that in the previous experiments with randomly or empirically selected conditions.
TI  - Short communication: Viability of culture organisms in honey-enriched acidophilus-bifidus-thermophilus (ABT)-type fermented camel milk.
AB  - The aim of this research was to monitor the survival during refrigerated storage  of Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 (A), Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis BB-12 (B), and Streptococcus thermophilus CHCC 742/2130 (T) in cultured dairy foods made from camel and, for comparison, cow milks supplemented with black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) honey and fermented by an acidophilus-bifidus-thermophilus (ABT)-type culture. Two liters of dromedary camel milk and 2 L of cow milk were heated to 90 degrees C and held for 10 min, then cooled to 40 degrees C. One half of both types of milk was fortified with black locust honey at the rate of 5.0% (wt/vol), whereas the other half was devoid of honey and served as a control. The camel and cow milks with and without honey were subsequently inoculated with ABT-5 culture and were fermented at 37 degrees C until a pH value of 4.6 was reached. Thereafter, the probiotic fermented milks were cooled to 15 degrees C in ice water and were each separated into 18 fractions that were transferred in sterile, tightly capped centrifuge tubes. After 24 h of cooling at 8 degrees C (d 0), the samples were stored at refrigeration temperature (4 degrees C). Three tubes of all 4 products (i.e., fermented camel and cow milks with and without honey) were taken at each sampling time (i.e., following 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 d of storage), and the counts of characteristic microorganisms and those of certain spoilage microbes (yeasts, molds, coliforms, Escherichia coli) were enumerated. The entire experimental program was repeated twice. The results showed that addition of black locust honey at 5% to heat-treated camel and cow milks did not influence the growth and survival of starter streptococci during production and subsequent refrigerated storage of fermented ABT milks. In contrast, honey improved retention of viability of B. animalis ssp. lactis BB-12 in the camel milk-based product during storage at 4 degrees C up to 5 wk. No spoilage organisms were detected in any of the samples tested in this study. In conclusion, supplementation of cultured dairy foods, especially those made from camel milk, with honey is recommended because honey is a healthy natural sweetener with a variety of beneficial microbiological, nutritional, and sensory properties.
TI  - Survival of Escherichia coli O157:H7 during manufacture and storage of white brined cheese.
AB  - Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a major foodborne pathogen that causes severe disease in humans. Survival of E. coli O157:H7 during processing and storage of white brined cheese was investigated. Cheeses were prepared using pasteurized milk inoculated with a 4 strain E. coli O157:H7 cocktail (7 log(10) CFU/g) with or without yogurt starter culture (Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus) and stored in 10% or 15% NaCl brine at 10 and 21 masculineC for 28 d. NaCl concentration, water activity (a(w)), pH, and numbers of E. coli O157:H7 and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were determined in cheese and brine. E. coli O157:H7 was able to survive in cheese stored in both brines at 10 and 21 masculineC regardless of the presence of starter LAB, although the latter significantly enhanced E. coli O157:H7 reduction in cheese or its brine at 10 masculineC. E. coli O157:H7 numbers were reduced by 2.6 and 3.4 log(10) CFU/g in cheese stored in 10% and 15% NaCl brine, respectively, in the presence of starter LAB and by 1.4 and 2.3 log(10) CFU/g, respectively, in the absence of starter LAB at 10 masculineC. The pathogen survived, but at lower numbers in the brines. The salt concentration of cheese stored in 10% brine remained about 5% during ripening, but in 15% brine, the NaCl level increased 1.6% to 8.1% (w/w) by 28 d. Values of pH and a(w) slightly decreased 1 d after exposure to brine and reached 5.5 to 6.6 and 0.88 to 0.94, respectively, in all treatments.
TI  - The cation diffusion facilitator protein EmfA of Rhizobium etli belongs to a novel subfamily of Mn(2+)/Fe(2+) transporters conserved in alpha-proteobacteria.
AB  - Manganese (Mn(2+)) plays a key role in important cellular functions such as oxidative stress response and bacterial virulence. The mechanisms of Mn(2+) homeostasis are not fully understood, there are few data regarding the functional and taxonomic diversity of Mn(2+) exporters. Our recent phylogeny of the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) family of transporters classified the bacterial Mn(2+)-CDF transporters characterized to date, Streptococcus pneumoniae MntE and Deinococcus radiodurans DR1236, into two monophyletic groups. DR1236 was shown to belong to the highly-diverse metal specificity clade VI, together with TtCzrB, a Zn(2+)/Cd(2+) transporter from Thermus thermophilus, the Fe(2+) transporter Sll1263 from Synechocystis sp and eight uncharacterized homologs whose potential Mn(2+)/Zn(2+)/Cd(2+)/Fe(2+) specificities could not be accurately inferred because only eleven proteins were grouped in this clade. A new phylogeny inferred from the alignment of 197 clade VI homologs revealed three novel subfamilies of uncharacterized proteins. Remarkably, one of them contained 91 uncharacterized alpha-proteobacteria transporters (46% of the protein data set) grouped into a single subfamily. The Mn(2+)/Fe(2+) specificity of this subfamily was proposed through the functional characterization of the Rhizobium etli RHE_CH03072 gene. This gene was upregulated by Mn(2+), Zn(2+), Cd(2+) and Fe(2+) but conferred only Mn(2+) resistance to R. etli. The expression of the RHE_CH03072 gene in an E. coli mntP/zitB/zntA mutant did not relieve either Zn(2+) or Mn(2+) stress but slightly increased its Fe(2+) resistance. These results indicate that the RHE_CH03072 gene, now designated as emfA, encodes for a bacterial Mn(2+)/Fe(2+) resistance CDF protein, having orthologs in more than 60 alpha-proteobacterial species.
TI  - Antioxidant and antibacterial activities of sulphated polysaccharides from Pleurotus eryngii and Streptococcus thermophilus ASCC 1275.
AB  - Polysaccharides from Pleurotus eryngii (PEPS) and exopolysaccharides from Streptococcus thermophilus ASCC 1275 (ST1275 EPS) were sulphated, and antioxidant and antibacterial activities of sulphated and crude polysaccharides were determined. Degree of sulphonation of PEPS and ST1275 EPS was 0.69 and 0.31, respectively. Characteristic bands in FT-IR spectra indicated that the sulphate group was at the C6 position of the galactose skeleton. Antioxidant activities of PEPS and ST1275 EPS were significantly (P<0.05) improved after sulphonation. For tested crude and sulphated polysaccharides, sulphated PEPS had the largest inhibition zone against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus CMCC 26003 while sulphated ST1275 EPS had the largest inhibition zone against Listeria monocytogenes CMCC 54001. Furthermore, sulphated PEPS had the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for E. coli ATCC 25922, and both sulphated PEPS and sulphated ST1275 EPS had the lowest MICs on S. aureus CMCC 26003 and L. monocytogenes CMCC 54001.
TI  - Enzymatic synthesis of bioinformatically predicted microcin C-like compounds encoded by diverse bacteria.
AB  - ABSTRACT The Trojan horse Escherichia coli antibiotic microcin C (McC) consists of a heptapeptide attached to adenosine through a phosphoramidate linkage. McC is synthesized by the MccB enzyme, which terminally adenylates the ribosomally synthesized heptapeptide precursor MccA. The peptide part is responsible for McC uptake; it is degraded inside the cell to release a toxic nonhydrolyzable aspartyl-adenylate. Bionformatic analysis reveals that diverse bacterial genomes encoding mccB homologues also contain adjacent short open reading frames that may encode MccA-like adenylation substrates. Using chemically synthesized predicted peptide substrates and recombinant cognate MccB protein homologs, adenylated products were obtained in vitro for predicted MccA peptide-MccB enzyme pairs from Helicobacter pylori, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus johnsonii, Bartonella washoensis, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Synechococcus sp. Some adenylated products were shown to inhibit the growth of E. coli by targeting aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, the target of McC. IMPORTANCE Our results prove that McC-like adenylated peptides are widespread and are encoded by both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and by cyanobacteria, opening ways for analyses of physiological functions of these compounds and for creation of microcin C-like antibiotics targeting various bacteria.
TI  - Effect of bacterial cell-free supernatants on infectivity of norovirus surrogates.
AB  - Bacterial metabolic products were evaluated for inhibitory effects on viral propagation in cell culture. Cell-free supernatants (CFS) were prepared from growth of Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433, Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 13525, Escherichia coli 08, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Bacillus subtilis 168, Bacillus coagulans 185A, B. coagulans 7050, Clostridium sporogenes PA3679, and a commercial probiotic mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Streptococcus thermophilus in microbiological medium or milk. The inhibitory effects of CFS on the propagation of murine norovirus 1 and Tulane virus in RAW 264.7 and LLCMK2 cells, respectively, were evaluated in the continuous presence of CFS or after exposure of host cells to CFS. Slight inhibition of viral propagation was observed for murine norovirus and Tulane virus in the continuous presence of CFS of B. subtilis 168 and E. faecalis 19433, respectively. CFS cytotoxicity was also determined by microscopic examination. Virus persisted in the CFS that demonstrated cytotoxic effects, suggesting a lack of direct effect of CFS on virions. The viral propagation indicates a general lack of competitive inhibition by bacterial extracellular products and bears significance in understanding the persistence of virus in food and human systems shared by bacteria that are recognized for their colonization and competitive capabilities.
TI  - Microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of May bryndza cheese.
AB  - Diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of May bryndza cheese, a traditional Slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. Quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and Geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. Diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese, lactobacilli, lactococci and Geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) CFU/g, 10(9) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. The diversity of bacteria encompassed Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Acinetobacter sp., Acinetobacter johnsonii, Citrobacter braakii, Clostridium bartlettii, Corynebacterium callunae, Corynebacterium maris, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus pallens, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Hafnia alvei, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "Leuconostoc garlicum", Mannheimia glucosida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas sp., Ps. fluorescens, "Ps. reactans", Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, "Rothia arfidiae", Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. felis, Staph. pasteuri, Staph. sciuri, Staph. xylosus, Streptococcus parauberis, Str. thermophilus and Variovorax paradoxus. The diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed Alternaria alternata, "Ascomycete sp.", Aspergillus fumigatus, Beauveria brongniartii, Candida xylopsoci, C. inconspicua, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Debaromyces hansenii, Fomes fomentarius, Galactomyces candidus, Gymnoascus reesii, Chaetomium globosum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Metarhizium anisopliae, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, P. camemberti, P. freii, P. polonicum, P. viridicatum, Pichia kudriavzevii, Sordaria alcina, Trichosporon lactis and Yarrowia lipolytica.
TI  - Utilization of major fucosylated and sialylated human milk oligosaccharides by isolated human gut microbes.
AB  - Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOS) are not digested in the proximal intestine. In distal intestine, HMOS collectively modify the microbiota, but the response of individual bacteria to individual components of the HMOS is not well defined. Here, each of 25 major isolates of the human intestinal microbiota was fed individual major fucosylated and sialylated HMOS in anaerobic culture. This allowed for an assessment of the influence of specific HMOS on the growth and metabolic products of individual microbiota bacteria. Most Bifidobacteria spp. and Bacteroides spp. grew, induced alpha-L-fucosidase activity, and produced abundant lactate or short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) when fed 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL), 3-FL, and lactodifucotetraose (LDFT). Lactobacillus delbrueckii ATCC7830, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC19433, and Streptococcus thermophilus ATCC19258 exhibited slight growth, pH reduction, and lactate production when supplemented with 2'-FL or 3-FL, but not LDFT. Supplementation with 3'-sialyllactose (3'-SL) and 6'-SL promoted moderate growth of Bifidobacterium longum JCM7007, 7009, 7010, 7011, 1272, 11347, ATCC15708, Bacteroides vulgatus ATCC8482, and B. thetaiotaomicron ATCC29148; accordingly, these bacteria exhibited greater neuraminidase activity and produced copious lactate, SCFA, or both. Lactobacillus delbrueckii ATCC7830 also consumed 6'-SL. In contrast, Clostridium spp., L. rhamnosus ATCC53103, E. faecalis ATCC29200, Staphylococcus spp., Enterobacter spp., and Escherichia coli K12 did not consume milk oligosaccharides nor produce appreciable acidic fermentation products. Specific Bifidobacteria and Bacteroides differentially digest specific individual HMOS, with the major fucosylated milk oligosaccharides most strongly stimulating key species of mutualist symbionts. This suggests strategies for treating dysbiosis of the microbiota and associated inflammatory disorders.
TI  - Evaluation of anti-bacterial and anti-oxidant potential of andrographolide and echiodinin isolated from callus culture of Andrographis paniculata Nees.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the anti-bacterial and anti-oxidant activity of andrographolide (AND) and echiodinin (ECH) of Andrographis paniculata. METHODS: In this study, an attempt has been made to demonstrate the anti-microbial and anti-oxidant activity of isolated AND and ECH by broth micro-dilution method and 2,2-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) assay, respectively. Structure elucidation was determined by electro-spray ionization-MSD, NMR ((1)H and (13)C) and IR spectra. RESULTS: AND was effective against most of the strains tested including Mycobacterium smegmatis, showing broad spectrum of growth inhibition activity with Minimum inhibitory concentration values against Staphylococcus aureus (100 microg/mL), Streptococcus thermophilus (350 microg/mL) Bacillus subtilis (100 microg/mL), Escherichia coli (50 microg/mL), Mycobacterium smegmatis (200 microg/mL), Klebsiella pneumonia (100 microg/mL), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (200 microg/mL). ECH showed specific anti-bacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at a concentration higher than 225 microg/mL. Both AND and ECH were not effective against the two yeast strains, Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae tested in this study. CONCLUSION: This preliminary study showed promising anti-bacterial activity and moderate free radical scavenging activity of AND and ECH, and it may provide the scientific rationale for its popular folklore medicines.
TI  - Bacterial lysates in food allergy prevention.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In the concept of food allergy prevention, no successful strategy could be identified until now. Although interventional trials using probiotics, prebiotics, hydrolyzed formula and bacterial lysates early in infancy were found to reduce the incidence of atopic dermatitis, no effect on food sensitization and allergy could be shown. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies in a farming environment showed that early contact to livestock, bacteria and moulds may upregulate the immune responses regulated via Toll-like receptors and thus prevent allergy. There is increasing evidence that the unbalanced composition of the human microbiome on human skin and mucosal surfaces may be a key player in the development of inflammatory diseases like allergy and asthma. However, during the last 5 years, this concept could not yet be verified in the interventional trials. There are few studies using bacterial lysates, for example, Escherichia coli plus Enterococcus faecalis in ProSymbioflor and heat-killed Bifidobacterium breve and Streptococcus thermophilus; however, food allergy prevalence could not be reduced by these interventions. SUMMARY: During the last 5 years, new interventional trials addressed the use of bacterial lysates. There was only an effect on eczema in the ProSymbioflor trial, whereas the trial using B. breve and S. thermophilus in a cow's milk formula showed a slight reduction of food sensitization at the age of 12 months. However, these strategies need further investigation and success seems to be restricted to certain subpopulations.
TI  - Probiotics improve survival of septic rats by suppressing conditioned pathogens in ascites.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the benefits of probiotics treatment in septic rats. METHODS: The septic rats were induced by cecal ligation and puncture. The animals of control, septic model and probiotics treated groups were treated with vehicle and mixed probiotics, respectively. The mixture of probiotics included Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. We observed the survival of septic rats using different amounts of mixed probiotics. We also detected the bacterial population in ascites and blood of experimental sepsis using cultivation and real-time polymerase chain reaction. The severity of mucosal inflammation in colonic tissues was determined. RESULTS: Probiotics treatment improved survival of the rats significantly and this effect was dose dependent. The survival rate was 30% for vehicle-treated septic model group. However, 1 and 1/4 doses of probiotics treatment increased survival rate significantly compared with septic model group (80% and 55% vs 30%, P < 0.05). The total viable counts of bacteria in ascites decreased significantly in probiotics treated group compared with septic model group (5.20 +/- 0.57 vs 9.81 +/- 0.67, P < 0.05). The total positive rate of hemoculture decreased significantly in probiotics treated group compared with septic model group (33.3% vs 100.0%, P < 0.05). The population of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus in ascites of probiotics treated group were decreased significantly compared with that of septic model group (3.93 +/- 0.73 vs 8.80 +/- 0.83, P < 0.05; 2.80 +/- 1.04 vs 5.39 +/- 1.21, P < 0.05). With probiotics treatment, there was a decrease in the scores of inflammatory cell infiltration into the intestinal mucosa in septic animals (1.50 +/- 0.25 vs 2.88 +/- 0.14, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus may be primary pathogens in septic rats. Probiotics improve survival of septic rats by suppressing these conditioned pathogens.
TI  - The Streptococcus thermophilus protein Wzh functions as a phosphotyrosine phosphatase.
AB  - Amino acid residues that are important for metal binding and catalysis in Gram-positive phosphotyrosine phosphatases were identified in the Wzh protein of Streptococcus thermophilus MR-1C by using sequence comparisons. A His-tagged fusion Wzh protein was purified from Escherichia coli cultures and tested for phosphatase activity against synthetic phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine-threonine peptides. Purified Wzh released 2316.5 +/- 138.7 pmol PO4.min(-1).mug(-1) from phosphotyrosine peptide-1 and 2345.7 +/- 135.2 pmol PO4.min(-1).mug(-1) from phosphotyrosine peptide-2. The presence of the phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium vanadate decreased purified Wzh activity by 45%-50% at 1 mmol.L(-1), 74%-84% at 5 mmol.L(-1), and by at least 88% at 10 mmol.L(-1). Purified Wzh had no detectable activity against the phosphoserine-threonine peptide. These results clearly establish that S. thermophilus MR-1C Wzh functions as a phosphotyrosine phosphatase that could function to remove phosphate groups from proteins involved in exopolysaccharide biosynthesis, including the protein tyrosine kinase Wze and priming glycosyltransferase.
TI  - High-throughput analysis of type I-E CRISPR/Cas spacer acquisition in E. coli.
AB  - In Escherichia coli, the acquisition of new CRISPR spacers is strongly stimulated by a priming interaction between a spacer in CRISPR RNA and a protospacer in foreign DNA. Priming also leads to a pronounced bias in DNA strand from which new spacers are selected. Here, ca. 200,000 spacers acquired during E. coli type I-E CRISPR/Cas-driven plasmid elimination were analyzed. Analysis of positions of plasmid protospacers from which newly acquired spacers have been derived is inconsistent with spacer acquisition machinery sliding along the target DNA as the primary mechanism responsible for strand bias during primed spacer acquisition. Most protospacers that served as donors of newly acquired spacers during primed spacer acquisition had an AAG protospacer adjacent motif, PAM. Yet, the introduction of multiple AAG sequences in the target DNA had no effect on the choice of protospacers used for adaptation, which again is inconsistent with the sliding mechanism. Despite a strong preference for an AAG PAM during CRISPR adaptation, the AAG (and CTT) triplets do not appear to be avoided in known E. coli phages. Likewise, PAM sequences are not avoided in Streptococcus thermophilus phages, indicating that CRISPR/Cas systems may not have been a strong factor in shaping host-virus interactions.
TI  - Phage biocontrol of enteropathogenic and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli during milk fermentation.
AB  - Two bacteriophages, isolated from faeces, were assayed as biocontrol agents of pathogenic Escherichia coli during milk fermentation. Phage DT1 was tested on the strain E. coli DH5alpha, one enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) strain and one Shiga toxigenic E. coli O157:H7 (STEC) strain. Phage DT6 was tested on two STEC strains (O157:H7 and non-O157). One additional assay was performed by using a cocktail of both phages against the O157:H7 STEC strain. Streptococcus thermophilus 10-C, the strain used as lactic starter, reached 10(9) CFU ml(-1) after 4 h, while pH values fell to 4.5 after 8 h, regardless of the presence of E. coli strains and/or phages. In absence of phages, E. coli strains reached 4-6 log CFU ml(-1) at 5-6 h. Escherichia coli DH5alpha and O157:H7 STEC strains were rapidly and completely inactivated by phage DT1 and phage cocktail, respectively, while O157:H7 STEC was completely inactivated either by DT1 or by DT6, after 8 h. The EPEC strain was not detected at 1 h (<10 CFU ml(-1) ) but grew afterwards, though at lower rates than without phage. For non-O157:H7 STEC, reductions lower than 1 log CFU ml(-1) were observed for all sampling times. Phages DT1 and DT6, either individually or as a cocktail, effectively reduce O157:H7 STEC counts during milk fermentation, without compromising the starter culture performance. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Coliphages DT1 and DT6, isolated from faeces and selected on the basis of their host range, showed to be valuable tools for the control of pathogenic Escherichia coli during milk fermentation, without compromising the starter culture performance. Both phages, either individually or as a cocktail, may function as an extra safety barrier beyond traditional pasteurization, effectively reducing O157:H7 Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) counts during early growth, thus avoiding Shiga toxin production and accumulation.
TI  - crRNA and tracrRNA guide Cas9-mediated DNA interference in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The Cas9-crRNA complex of the Streptococcus thermophilus DGCC7710 CRISPR3-Cas system functions as an RNA-guided endonuclease with crRNA-directed target sequence recognition and protein-mediated DNA cleavage. We show here that an additional RNA molecule, tracrRNA (trans-activating CRISPR RNA), co-purifies with the Cas9 protein isolated from the heterologous E. coli strain carrying the S. thermophilus DGCC7710 CRISPR3-Cas system. We provide experimental evidence that tracrRNA is required for Cas9-mediated DNA interference both in vitro and in vivo. We show that Cas9 specifically promotes duplex formation between the precursor crRNA (pre-crRNA) transcript and tracrRNA, in vitro. Furthermore, the housekeeping RNase III contributes to primary pre-crRNA-tracrRNA duplex cleavage for mature crRNA biogenesis. RNase III, however, is not required in the processing of a short pre-crRNA transcribed from a minimal CRISPR array containing a single spacer. Finally, we show that an in vitro-assembled ternary Cas9-crRNA-tracrRNA complex cleaves DNA. This study further specifies the molecular basis for crRNA-based re-programming of Cas9 to specifically cleave any target DNA sequence for precise genome surgery. The processes for crRNA maturation and effector complex assembly established here will contribute to the further development of the Cas9 re-programmable system for genome editing applications.
TI  - In silico modeling of the type 2 IDI enzymes of Bacillus licheniformis, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus for virtual screening of potential inhibitors of this therapeutic target.
AB  - Isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase is an essential enzyme in those living organisms such as pathogenic strains of Streptococcus and Staphylococcus genera which rely on the Mevalonate pathway for the production of isoprenoids. The pathogens contain type 2 IDI in contrast to human that contains type 1 IDI. Therefore, the type 2 IDI may be a potential target for the therapy of some infectious diseases. In the current study, a virtual screening by docking was performed among 2000 chemicals from CoCoCo library to find a specific inhibitor for type 2 IDIs. To this end, the structures of the type 2 IDIs of Bacillus licheniformis, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus were molded using comparative modeling and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based prediction. The predicted models were evaluated based on Q-mean and Prosa score. Molegro Virtual Docker with MolDock scoring function was used for measuring the binding affinity of the found inhibitor to the active site of the models. Also the inhibition effect of the compound was virtually tested on the crystallography-solved structures of the Sulfolobus shibatae and Thermus thermophilus type 2 IDIs as well as the Escherichia coli type 1 IDI. Finally, the inhibition effect of the found inhibitor was virtually tested on the human type 1 IDI. Interestingly, the results suggest that the inhibitor efficiently binds to and inhibits the bacterial IDIs especially the type 2 IDIs of pathogens while it is not inhibiting the human IDI.
TI  - [Investigation of the effects of probiotic bacteria on bacterial translocation that developed during diagnostic laparoscopy: an experimental study].
AB  - Probiotics which are non-pathogenic live microorganisms ingested along with food  or as dietary supplements, are thought to be beneficial to the host by supporting the microbial balance in digestive system. Various studies suggest that the effects of probiotics on the intestinal mucosa and immunity are protective against bacterial translocation. We aimed to investigate bacterial translocation related to the amount of CO2 insufflation given during laparoscopy and the effect of probiotic bacteria in an experimental peritonitis model. In this study 60 Wistar rats were used in six groups consisting of 10 rats. Group 1, 3 and 5 consisted of the rats that were fed without probiotics, while the rats in Group 2, 4, and 6 were fed with water containing 5 x 108 cfu/ml probiotic bacteria complex (Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus) for 15 days. To generate experimental peritonitis, 2 x 107 cfu/ml Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was inoculated intraperitoneally to all of the rats. Thereafter, laparoscopy was applied in all groups. Application in Group 1 and Group 2 was without CO2; Group 3 and Group 4 with 14 mmHg CO2 insufflation, and Group 5 and Group 6 with 20 mmHg CO2 insufflation. Blood samples were taken in 2nd, 4th, and 6th hours. Mesenteric lymph node, liver and spleen samples were taken at 6th hour when the rats were sacrificed and then these were evaluated microbiologically with qualitative and quantitative methods. Bacterial translocation and bacteremia were found in the rats that were undergone experimental peritonitis during laparoscopy. All positive tissue and blood cultures yielded E.coli. The highest level of bacterial translocation was found to be in mesenteric lymph nodes (in 3/10, 6/10 and 10/10 in groups 1, 3 and 5 fed without probiotics, respectively; in 2/10, 3/10 and 4/10 in groups 2, 4 and 6 fed with probiotics, respectively). The bacterial translocation rates were found to be related to the increased CO2 insufflation. It was found that probiotic bacteria were more effective for decreasing bacterial translocation rates and bacteremia in the groups that were given high CO2 pressure during laparoscopy. It was also found that these results were correlated with bacterial translocation per gram of tissue. As an example, the quantitative bacterial growth values detected in mesenteric lymph node were 5.4 +/- 2.9 x 103, 10.6 +/- 3.3 x 103 and 21.5 +/- 12.4 x 103 cfu/g in groups 1, 3 and 5, fed without probiotics, respectively; and 2.0 +/- 1.3 x 103, 3.8 +/- 1.9 x 103 and 9.0 +/- 3.1 x 103 cfu/g in groups 2, 4 and 6, fed with probiotics, respectively. Our data emphasized that probiotic bacteria may be used as prophylactic agents for the prevention of bacterial translocation during laparoscopy, however comprehensive and clinical studies are needed to support these experimental results.
TI  - Structural aspects of the interaction of dairy phages with their host bacteria.
AB  - Knowledge of phage-host interactions at a fundamental level is central to the design of rational strategies for the development of phage-resistant strains that may be applied in industrial settings. Phages infecting lactic acid bacteria, in particular Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus, negatively impact on dairy fermentation processes with serious economic implications. In recent years a wealth of information on structural protein assembly and topology has become available relating to phages infecting Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Lactococcus lactis, which act as models for structural analyses of dairy phages. In this review, we explore the role of model tailed phages, such as T4 and SPP1, in advancing our knowledge regarding interactions between dairy phages and their hosts. Furthermore, the potential of currently investigated dairy phages to in turn serve as model systems for this particular group of phages is discussed.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from cheeses and yogurts.
AB  - The biopreservation of foods using bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated directly from foods is an innovative approach. The objectives of this study were to isolate and identify bacteriocinogenic LAB from various cheeses and yogurts and evaluate their antimicrobial effects on selected spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in vitro as well as on a food commodity.LAB were isolated using MRS and M17 media. The agar diffusion bioassay was used to screen for bacteriocin or bacteriocin-like substances (BLS) producing LAB using Lactobacillus sakei and Listeria innocua as indicator organisms. Out of 138 LAB isolates, 28 were found to inhibit these bacteria and were identified as strains of Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Eight isolates were tested for antimicrobial activity at 5 degrees C and 20 degrees C against L. innocua, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Erwinia carotovora, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides using the agar diffusion bioassay, and also against Penicillium expansum, Botrytis cinerea and Monilinia frucitcola using the microdilution plate method. The effect of selected LAB strains on L. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions was also investigated.Twenty percent of our isolates produced BLS inhibiting the growth of L. innocua and/or Lact. sakei. Organic acids and/or H2O2 produced by LAB and not the BLS had strong antimicrobial effects on all microorganisms tested with the exception of E. coli. Ent. faecium, Strep. thermophilus and Lact. casei effectively inhibited the growth of natural microflora and L. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions. Bacteriocinogenic LAB present in cheeses and yogurts may have potential to be used as biopreservatives in foods.
TI  - Stimulation of cadaverine production by foodborne pathogens in the presence of Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Streptococcus spp.
AB  - The effect of Lactobacillus plantarum (FI8595), Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG 1363), Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (IL 1403), and Streptococcus thermophilus on cadaverine and other biogenic amine production by foodborne pathogens was investigated lysine decarboxylase broth. Both of lactic acid bacteria and foodborne pathogens used (especially Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis and Lb. plantarum) had an ability to convert aminoacids into biogenic amine. The conversion of lysine into cadaverine was the highest (167.11 mg/L) by Lactobacillus spp. Gram-positive bacteria generally had a greater ability to produce cadaverine with corresponding value of 46.26, 53.76, and 154.54 mg/L for Enterococcus faecalis, S. aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes, respectively. Significant variations on biogenic amine production were observed in the presence of lactic acid bacteria strains (P < 0.05). The role of lactic acid bacteria on biogenic amine production by foodborne pathogens varied depending on strains and specific amine. Cadaverine accumulation by Enterobactericeae was increased in the presence of lactic acid bacteria strains except for St. thermophilus, which induced 2-fold lower cadaverine production by S. Paratyphi A. Lc. lactis subsp. lactis and Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris induced 10-fold higher increases in histamine for E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively. Lactic acid bacteria resulted in strong increases in cadaverine production by P. aeruginosa, although remarkable decreases were observed for histamine, spermidine, dopamine, agmatine, and TMA in the presence of lactic acid bacteria in lysine decarboxylase broth . The result of the study showed that amine positive lactic acid bacteria strains in fermented food led to significant amine accumulation by contaminant bacteria and their accumulation in food product may be controlled by the use of proper starters with amine-negative activity.
TI  - Proteolytic activation of proteose peptone component 3 by release of a C-terminal peptide with antibacterial properties.
AB  - The milk protein proteose peptone component 3 (PP3, also known as lactophorin) is a small phosphoglycoprotein, which is exclusively expressed in the lactating mammary gland. A 23-residue synthetic peptide (lactophoricin, Lpcin S), corresponding to the C-terminal amphipathic alpha-helix of PP3, has previously been shown to permeabilize membranes and display antibacterial activity. Lactophorin readily undergoes proteolytic cleavage in milk and during dairy processing, and it has been suggested that PP3-derived peptides are part of milk's endogenous defense system against bacteria. Here, we report that a 26-residue C-terminal peptide (Lpcin P) can be generated by trypsin proteolysis of PP3 and that structural and functional studies of Lpcin P indicate that the peptide has antibacterial properties. The Lpcin P showed alpha-helical structure in both anionic and organic solvents, and the amount of alpha-helical structure was increased in the presence of lipid vesicles. Oriented circular dichroism showed that Lpcin P oriented parallel to the membrane surface. However, the peptide permeabilized calcein-containing vesicles efficiently. Lpcin P displayed antibacterial activity against Streptococcus thermophilus, but not against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The PP3 full-length protein did not display the same properties, which could indicate that PP3 functions as a precursor protein that upon proteolysis, releases a bioactive antibacterial peptide.
TI  - Molecular analysis of the glutamate decarboxylase locus in Streptococcus thermophilus ST110.
AB  - gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is generated from glutamate by the action of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and characterized by hypotensive, diuretic, and tranquilizing effects in humans and animals. The production of GABA by lactic acid starter bacteria would enhance the functionality of fermented dairy foods including cheeses and yogurt. The survey of 42 strains of the yogurt starter culture Streptococcus thermophilus by PCR techniques indicated the presence of a glutamate decarboxylase gene (gadB) in 16 strains. DNA sequencing data indicated that the GAD/GABA antiporter locus (gadB/gadC) in GAD(+) S. thermophilus strains is flanked by transposase elements (5' and 3') and positioned between the luxS (5') and the HD-superfamily hydrolase genes (3'). The PCR amplification product of a ca. 2-kb genomic fragment that included the gadB and its putative promoter region was inserted into a shuttle vector, which was used to transform Escherichia coli DH5alpha. Subsequently, the recombinant plasmid pMEU5a-1/gadB (7.24 kb) was electrotransformed into the GAD-negative strain S. thermophilus ST128. The ST128 transformants carrying the plasmid-encoded gadB produced functional GAD enzyme as evidenced by the conversion of glutamate to GABA at a rate similar to strains with the gadB/gadC operon located on the chromosome. The results demonstrated the potential to impart to non-GABA-producing strains of S. thermophilus and other lactic acid bacteria the GAD(+) phenotype that improves their appeal in possible applications in the development of health-promoting functional foods.
TI  - Cytokine profile and induction of T helper type 17 and regulatory T cells by human peripheral mononuclear cells after microbial exposure.
AB  - The immunomodulatory effects of probiotics were assessed following exposure of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), cord blood cells and the spleen-derived monocyte/macrophage cell line CRL-9850 to Lactobacillus acidophilus LAVRI-A1, Lb. rhamnosus GG, exopolysaccharides (EPS)-producing Streptococcus thermophilus St1275, Bifidobacteriun longum BL536, B. lactis B94 and Escherichia coli TG1 strains. The production of a panel of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines by PBMC following bacterial stimulation was measured, using live, heat-killed or mock gastrointestinal tract (GIT)-exposed bacteria, and results show that (i) all bacterial strains investigated induced significant secretion of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines from PBMC-derived monocytes/macrophages; and (ii) cytokine levels increased relative to the expansion of bacterial cell numbers over time for cells exposed to live cultures. Bifidobacteria and S. thermophilus stimulated significant concentrations of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, an interleukin necessary for the differentiation of regulatory T cells (T(reg) )/T helper type 17 (Th17) cells and, as such, the study further examined the induction of Th17 and T(reg) cells after PBMC exposure to selected bacteria for 96 h. Data show a significant increase in the numbers of both cell types in the exposed populations, measured by cell surface marker expression and by cytokine production. Probiotics have been shown to induce cytokines from a range of immune cells following ingestion of these organisms. These studies suggest that probiotics' interaction with immune-competent cells produces a cytokine milieu, exerting immunomodulatory effects on local effector cells, as well as potently inducing differentiation of Th17 and T(reg) cells.
TI  - The fate of indigenous microbiota, starter cultures, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua and Staphylococcus aureus in Danish raw milk and cheeses determined by pyrosequencing and quantitative real time (qRT)-PCR.
AB  - The purpose of this work was to study the bacterial communities in raw milk and in Danish raw milk cheeses using pyrosequencing of tagged amplicons of the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rDNA and cDNA. Furthermore, the effects of acidification and ripening starter cultures, cooking temperatures and rate of acidification on survival of added Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua and Staphylococcus aureus in cheeses at different stages of ripening were studied by pyrosequencing and quantitative real time (qRT)-PCR. A high diversity of bacterial species was detected in raw milk. Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus rhamnosus were the main bacteria detected in raw milk and cheeses. Bacteria belonging to the genera Brevibacterium, Staphylococcus, Escherichia, Weissella, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus were also detected in both 16S rDNA and cDNA obtained from raw milk and cheeses. E. coli, which was added to milk used for production of some cheeses, was detected in both DNA and RNA extracted from cheeses at different stages of ripening showing the highest percentage of the total sequence reads at 7 days of ripening and decreased again in the later ripening stages. Growth of E. coli in cheeses appeared to be affected by the cooking temperature and the rate of acidification but not by the ripening starter cultures applied or the indigenous microbiota of raw milk. Growth of L. innocua and S. aureus added to milks was inhibited in all cheeses at different stages of ripening. The use of 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing and qRT-PCR allows a deeper understanding of the behavior of indigenous microbiota, starter cultures and pathogenic bacteria in raw milk and cheeses.
TI  - Construction of theta-type shuttle vector for Leuconostoc and other lactic acid bacteria using pCB42 isolated from kimchi.
AB  - The pCB42 plasmid from Leuconostoc citreum CB2567, a strain isolated from kimchi, was characterized, and a shuttle vector for Escherichia coli and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) was constructed. The pCB42 plasmid has a circular structure of 4312bp, a low G+C content, and no single-stranded DNA intermediates during replication, which indicates that pCB42 replicates via the theta-type replication mechanism. In silico analysis of this plasmid revealed 6 open reading frames: 1 transposase gene, 1 DNA-binding gene, 2 putative replication genes, and 2 unknown genes. The fragment encompassing ORF5 contains a functional plasmid replicon. This plasmid was capable of replicating in various LAB, including L. citreum, L. mesenteroides, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lb. reuteri, Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Weissella confusa, and Oenococcus oeni. The LAB-E. coli shuttle vector was constructed by ligating pCB42 and pEK104, and the resulting shuttle vector, pLeuCM42, showed a high segregational stability in L. citreum CB2567 after 100 generations of cell division. By using this shuttle vector, the beta-gal gene from Lb. plantarum was successfully expressed in the host strain, L. citreum CB2567. The pLeuCM42 shuttle vector can serve as a useful gene-delivery and expression tool for the genetic study or metabolic engineering of various strains of LAB.
TI  - Physicochemical, microbiological and sensory profiles of fermented milk containing probiotic strains isolated from kefir.
AB  - A two-strain starter culture containing Lactobacillus plantarum CIDCA 83114, a potential probiotic strain isolated from kefir grains, and Streptococcus thermophilus CIDCA 321 was tested for the preparation of a fermented milk product. Kluyveromyces marxianus CIDCA 8154, a yeast with immunomodulatory properties was included to formulate a three-strain starter culture. Supernatants of enterohaemorragic Escherichia coli, shiga-toxin-producing strain, along with a two-strain or a three-strain starter culture were included in the medium of Vero-cell surface cultures. The results demonstrated that these combinations of microorganisms antagonize the cytopathic action of shiga toxins. The cell concentration of Lb. plantarum did not decrease during fermentation, indicating that the viability of this strain was not affected by low pH, nor did the number of viable bacteria change during 21 days of storage in either fermented products. The number of viable yeasts increases during fermentation and storage. Trained assessors analyzed the general acceptability of fresh fermented milks and considered both acceptable. The milk fermented with the two-strain starter culture was considered acceptable after two week of storage, while the product fermented with the three-strain starter culture remained acceptable for less than one week. The main changes in sensory attributes detected by the trained panel were in sour taste, milky taste and also in fermented attributes. The correlation between different sensory attributes and acceptability indicated that the panel was positively influenced by milky attributes (taste, odour, and flavour) as well as the intensity of flavour. In conclusion, the two-strain starter culture would be the more promising alternative for inclusion of that potential probiotic lactobacillus in a fermented milk product.
TI  - The Streptococcus thermophilus CRISPR/Cas system provides immunity in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The CRISPR/Cas adaptive immune system provides resistance against phages and plasmids in Archaea and Bacteria. CRISPR loci integrate short DNA sequences from invading genetic elements that provide small RNA-mediated interference in subsequent exposure to matching nucleic acids. In Streptococcus thermophilus, it was previously shown that the CRISPR1/Cas system can provide adaptive immunity against phages and plasmids by integrating novel spacers following exposure to these foreign genetic elements that subsequently direct the specific cleavage of invasive homologous DNA sequences. Here, we show that the S. thermophilus CRISPR3/Cas system can be transferred into Escherichia coli and provide heterologous protection against plasmid transformation and phage infection. We show that interference is sequence-specific, and that mutations in the vicinity or within the proto-spacer adjacent motif (PAM) allow plasmids to escape CRISPR-encoded immunity. We also establish that cas9 is the sole cas gene necessary for CRISPR-encoded interference. Furthermore, mutation analysis revealed that interference relies on the Cas9 McrA/HNH- and RuvC/RNaseH-motifs. Altogether, our results show that active CRISPR/Cas systems can be transferred across distant genera and provide heterologous interference against invasive nucleic acids. This can be leveraged to develop strains more robust against phage attack, and safer organisms less likely to uptake and disseminate plasmid-encoded undesirable genetic elements.
TI  - Short communication: characterization of microflora in Mexican Chihuahua cheese.
AB  - This work was performed to identify the bacterial species present in 10 Chihuahua cheeses obtained from commercial producers in Mexico using 16S rRNA gene analysis. As expected, some of the agar media initially used for isolation were not very selective, supporting the growth of several unrelated bacterial species. Sequence analysis identified potential pathogens, including Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, in all raw milk samples and 2 pasteurized milk samples. Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis were identified in 9 and 6 samples, respectively, and would serve as acidifying agents during cheese production. Lactobacilli were identified in all cheeses, with the most prevalent being Lactobacillus plantarum identified in 7 raw milk and 1 pasteurized milk cheeses. Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Streptococcus macedonicus were identified in 4 raw milk cheeses and both were present in all pasteurized milk samples, suggesting that they may play a role in the development of traditional Chihuahua cheese attributes.
TI  - Typing of bacteriophages by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR to assess genetic diversity.
AB  - The recent boom in phage therapy and phage biocontrol requires the design of suitable cocktails of genetically different bacteriophages. The current methods for typing phages need significant quantities of purified DNA, may require a priori genetic information and are cost and time consuming. We have evaluated the randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR technique to produce unique and reproducible band patterns from 26 different bacteriophages infecting Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactococcus lactis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus thermophilus, Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus casei bacterial strains. Initially, purified DNA and phage suspensions of seven selected phages were used as a template. The conditions that were found to be optimal 8 muM of 10-mer primers, 3 muM magnesium oxalacetate and 5% dimethyl sulfoxide. The RAPD genomic fingerprints using a phage titer suspension higher than 10(9) PFU mL(-1) were highly reproducible. Clustering by the Pearson correlation coefficient and the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages clustering algorithm correlated largely with genetically different phages infecting the same bacterial species, although closely related phages with a similar DNA restriction pattern were indistinguishable. The results support the use of RAPD-PCR for quick typing of phage isolates and preliminary assessment of their genetic diversity bypassing tedious DNA purification protocols and previous knowledge of their sequence.
TI  - Production of glutathione using a bifunctional enzyme encoded by gshF from Streptococcus thermophilus expressed in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Glutathione (GSH) is one of the most ubiquitous non-protein thiols that is involved in numerous cellular activities. The gene coding for a novel bifunctional enzyme catalyzing the reaction for glutathione synthesis, gshF, was cloned from Streptococcus thermophilus SIIM B218 and expressed in Escherichia coli JM109. In the presence of the precursor amino acids and ATP, the induced cells of E. coli JM109 (pTrc99A-gshF) could accumulate 10.3 mM GSH in 5 h. The S. thermophilus GshF was insensitive to feedback inhibition caused by GSH even at 20 mM. At elevated concentrations of the precursor amino acids and ATP, E. coli JM109 (pTrc99A-gshF) produced 36 mM GSH with a molar yield of 0.9 mol/mol based on added cysteine and of 0.45 mol/mol based on added ATP. When ATP was replaced with glucose, E. coli JM109 (pTrc99A-gshF) produced 7 mM in 3h. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used to generate ATP for GSH production. In the presence of glucose and the pmr1 mutant of S. cerevisiae BY4742, JM109 (pTrc99A-gshF) produced 33.9 mM GSH in 12h with a yield of 0.85 mol/mol based on added l-cysteine. It is shown that the S. thermophilus GshF can be successfully used for GSH production.
TI  - Hyaluronic acid production by recombinant Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Generally recognized as safe, Streptococcus thermophilus was transformed using a  plasmid expressing endogenous hyaluronic acid (HA) synthase genes. A single expression of hyaluronic acid synthase (hasA), uridine diphosphate-glucose dehydrogenase gene (hasB), or pyrophosphorylase gene (glmU) and double expression of hasA and hasB were attempted. A streptococcus-Escherichia coli shuttle vector, pBE31, was successfully transfected in S. thermophilus. The single expression of hasA or hasB allowed S. thermophilus to produce about 0.5-1.0 g/l HA. The strains coexpressing of hasA and hasB showed a markedly increased HA production (1.2g/l) which was six-fold increase compared with the wild-type strain. The maximum cell concentration and specific growth rate of each recombinant strain were lower than those of the wild-type strain; however, the specific production rate was more than 100-fold higher. Galactose concentration decreased in the coexpressing strain after depletion of lactose. The bacterial metabolism would be altered in order to achieve a higher production by changing the intracellular metabolism. The average molecular weight of HA (1.0 x 10(6) Da) was not affected by the expression of hasA and hasB. HA produced from recombinant strain could be an alternative material for medical, cosmetic and food utilization instead of HA from conventional pathogenic streptococci.
TI  - Cas3 is a single-stranded DNA nuclease and ATP-dependent helicase in the CRISPR/Cas immune system.
AB  - Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) is a recently discovered adaptive prokaryotic immune system that provides acquired immunity against foreign nucleic acids by utilizing small guide crRNAs (CRISPR RNAs) to interfere with invading viruses and plasmids. In Escherichia coli, Cas3 is essential for crRNA-guided interference with virus proliferation. Cas3 contains N-terminal HD phosphohydrolase and C-terminal Superfamily 2 (SF2) helicase domains. Here, we provide the first report of the cloning, expression, purification and in vitro functional analysis of the Cas3 protein of the Streptococcus thermophilus CRISPR4 (Ecoli subtype) system. Cas3 possesses a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-stimulated ATPase activity, which is coupled to unwinding of DNA/DNA and RNA/DNA duplexes. Cas3 also shows ATP-independent nuclease activity located in the HD domain with a preference for ssDNA substrates. To dissect the contribution of individual domains, Cas3 separation-of-function mutants (ATPase(+)/nuclease(-) and ATPase(-)/nuclease(+)) were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis. We propose that the Cas3 ATPase/helicase domain acts as a motor protein, which assists delivery of the nuclease activity to Cascade-crRNA complex targeting foreign DNA.
TI  - HdcB, a novel enzyme catalysing maturation of pyruvoyl-dependent histidine decarboxylase.
AB  - Pyruvoyl-dependent histidine decarboxylases are produced as proenzymes that mature by cleavage followed by formation of the pyruvoyl prosthetic group. The histidine decarboxylation pathway of Streptococcus thermophilus CHCC1524 that consists of the pyruvoyl-dependent histidine decarboxylase HdcA and the histidine/histamine exchanger HdcP was functionally expressed in Lactococcus lactis. The operon encoding the pathway contains in addition to the hdcA and hdcP genes a third gene hdcB. Expression of different combinations of the genes in L. lactis and Escherichia coli followed by analysis of the protein products demonstrated the involvement of HdcB in the cleavage of the HdcA proenzyme. The HdcA proenzyme and HdcB protein were purified to homogeneity and cleavage and activation of the histidine decarboxylase activity was demonstrated in vitro. Substoichiometric amounts of HdcB were required to cleave HdcA showing that HdcB functions as an enzyme. In agreement, expression levels of HdcB in the cells were low relative to those of HdcA. The turnover number of HdcB in vitro was extremely low (0.05 min(-)(1)) which was due to a very slow association/dissociation of the enzyme/substrate complex. In fact, HdcB was shown to co-purify both with the HdcA S82A mutant that mimics the proenzyme and with the mature HdcA complex.
TI  - Probiotic yogurt effects on intestinal flora of patients with chronic liver disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic liver disease generally have intestinal flora imbalance that is related to the development and worsening of the disease. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of probiotic yogurt on intestinal flora of patients with chronic liver disease. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial, pretest-posttest control group design, was used. Patients were randomized to an experimental group (41 patients) or a control group (40 patients). Patients in the experimental group were given probiotic yogurt (one cup each time, three times per day for 14 days) containing Bacillus bifidus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus within 2 hours after meals. Levels of fecal flora, symptoms and signs, and laboratory examination indexes were collected. RESULTS: After intervention, the experimental group had a lower Escherichia coli count and reduced intestinal flora imbalance (p < .05). Comparison of the experimental and control groups after the intervention showed that the former had improved symptoms and signs, including significant improvement in debilitation, food intake, appetite, abdominal distension, and ascitic fluid (p < .05). CONCLUSION: Probiotic yogurt reduces the levels of intestinal flora imbalance and has an additional therapeutic effect on patients with chronic liver disease.
TI  - Bacillus subtilis CwlP of the SP-{beta} prophage has two novel peptidoglycan hydrolase domains, muramidase and cross-linkage digesting DD-endopeptidase.
AB  - For bacteria and bacteriophages, cell wall digestion by hydrolases is a very important event. We investigated one of the proteins involved in cell wall digestion, the yomI gene product (renamed CwlP). The gene is located in the SP-beta prophage region of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome. Inspection of the Pfam database indicates that CwlP contains soluble lytic transglycosylase (SLT) and peptidase M23 domains, which are similar to Escherichia coli lytic transglycosylase Slt70, and the Staphylococcus aureus Gly-Gly endopeptidase LytM, respectively. The SLT domain of CwlP exhibits hydrolytic activity toward the B. subtilis cell wall; however, reverse phase (RP)-HPLC and mass spectrometry revealed that the CwlP-SLT domain has only muramidase activity. In addition, the peptidase M23 domain of CwlP exhibited hydrolytic activity and could cleave d-Ala-diaminopimelic acid cross-linkage, a property associated with dd-endopeptidases. Remarkably, the M23 domain of CwlP possessed a unique Zn(2+)-independent endopeptidase activity; this contrasts with all other characterized M23 peptidases (and enzymes similar to CwlP), which are Zn(2+) dependent. Both domains of CwlP could hydrolyze the peptidoglycan and cell wall of B. subtilis. However, the M23 domain digested neither the peptidoglycans nor the cell walls of S. aureus or Streptococcus thermophilus. The effect of defined point mutations in conserved amino acid residues of CwlP is also determined.
TI  - Efficient bioconversion of lactose in milk and whey: immobilization and biochemical characterization of a beta-galactosidase from the dairy Streptococcus thermophilus LMD9 strain.
AB  - The gene encoding beta-galactosidase from dairy Streptococcus thermophilus strain LMD9 was cloned, sequenced and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme was purified and showed high specific activity of 464 U/mg. This protein displays a homotetrameric arrangement composed of four 118 kDa monomers. Monitoring of the activity showed that this enzyme was optimally active at a wide range of temperatures (25-40 degrees C) and at pH from 6.5 to 7.5. Immobilization of the recombinant E. coli in alginate beads clearly enhanced the enzyme activity at various temperatures, including 4 and 50 degrees C, and at pH values from 4.0 to 8.5. Stability studies indicated that this biocatalyst has high stability within a broad range of temperatures and pH. This stability was improved not only by addition of 1 mM of Mn(2+) and 1.2 mM Mg(2+), but essentially through immobilization. The remarkable bioconversion rates of lactose in milk and whey at different temperatures revealed the attractive catalytic efficiency of this enzyme, thus promoting its use for lactose hydrolysis in milk and other dairy products.
TI  - Role of antioxidant enzymes in bacterial resistance to organic acids.
AB  - Growth in aerobic environments has been shown to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to cause oxidative stress in most organisms. Antioxidant enzymes (i.e., superoxide dismutases and hydroperoxidases) and DNA repair mechanisms provide protection against ROS. Acid stress has been shown to be associated with the induction of Mn superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in Lactococcus lactis and Staphylococcus aureus. However, the relationship between acid stress and oxidative stress is not well understood. In the present study, we showed that mutations in the gene coding for MnSOD (sodA) increased the toxicity of lactic acid at pH 3.5 in Streptococcus thermophilus. The inclusion of the iron chelators 2,2'-dipyridyl (DIP), diethienetriamine-pentaacetic acid (DTPA), and O-phenanthroline (O-Phe) provided partial protection against 330 mM lactic acid at pH 3.5. The results suggested that acid stress triggers an iron-mediated oxidative stress that can be ameliorated by MnSOD and iron chelators. These findings were further validated in Escherichia coli strains lacking both MnSOD and iron SOD (FeSOD) but expressing a heterologous MnSOD from S. thermophilus. We also found that, in E. coli, FeSOD did not provide the same protection afforded by MnSOD and that hydroperoxidases are equally important in protecting the cells against acid stress. These findings may explain the ability of some microorganisms to survive better in acidified environments, as in acid foods, during fermentation and accumulation of lactic acid or during passage through the low pH of the stomach.
TI  - Characterization of a novel LysM domain from Lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to display heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The endolysin Lyb5, from Lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phiPYB5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative bacteria. Sequence analysis revealed that the C terminus of the endolysin Lyb5 (Ly5C) contained three putative lysin motif (LysM) repeat regions, implying that Ly5C was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. To investigate the potential of Ly5C for surface display, green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused to Ly5C at its N or C terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli. After being mixed with various cells in vitro, GFP was successfully displayed on the surfaces of Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, Lb. brevis, Lb. plantarum, Lb. fermentum, Lb. delbrueckii, Lb. helveticus, and Streptococcus thermophilus cells. Increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated L. lactis and Lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for Ly5C. Moreover, the pH and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of GFP-Ly5C, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. All results suggested that Ly5C was a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (LAB). To demonstrate the applicability of the Ly5C-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal) from Paenibacillus sp. strain K1, replacing GFP, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of LAB cells via Ly5C. The success in surface display of GFP and beta-Gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in LAB.
TI  - A microfluidic approach for high efficiency extraction of low molecular weight RNA.
AB  - The lack of sample pre-treatment concepts that are easily automatable, miniaturized and highly efficient for both small volumes and low target concentrations, is one of the key issues that block the road towards effective miniaturized diagnostic instruments. This paper presents a novel, highly efficient and simple method for low-molecular weight RNA extraction using electricity only. Cells are lysed by thermo-electric lysis and RNA is purified using a gel-electrophoretic purification step. The combination of the two steps in one integrated cartridge reduces the time frame between the two steps, thus protecting RNA from enzymatic degradation. A disposable chip solution is proposed using a novel dry film resist laminate technology that allows cheap, large-scale fabrication. The chip contains crucial microfluidic innovations that allow for a simple user interface, reproducible functioning and precise quantification. Phaseguides are invented that allow controlled spatial injection of gel, injection of sample and recovery of extracted RNA. A precise sample volume can be defined by integrating electrophoretic actuation electrodes in the microfluidic chamber. Electrolytic gas bubbles that are the result of constant-current actuation are driven out from the chip by the novel introduction of capillary bubble-expulsion techniques. The extraction approach and the functionality of the chip are demonstrated for Escherichia coli and Streptococcus thermophilus bacteria. Linear extraction behavior is obtained for transfer-messenger RNA down to one colony-forming unit per microlitre, or five colony-forming units per chip. The latter is an increase in extraction efficiency of a factor of 1000 with respect to the commercial extraction kit Ambion Ribopure. The chip shows particularly good performance for extraction of low-molecular weight RNA, thereby eliminating the need for large ribosomal RNA and DNA removal. RNA can be extracted in less than 11 min, being a speed-up of more than a factor of 20 with respect to commercial extraction kits. The presented solution may find broad acceptance and application in drug discovery and clinical diagnostics.
TI  - Probiotic therapy for ulcerative colitis.
AB  
TI  - Heterologous expression of the Bacillus subtilis (natto) alanine dehydrogenase in Escherichia coli and Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - The major objective of the present study is to change the alanine production of Lactic acid bacteria by expression of Bacillus subtilis (natto) alanine dehydrogenase (AlaDH), the gene that is not present in Lactic acid. B. subtilis AlaDH gene (ald) was cloned into a pGEX6p-1 and expressed in E. coli JM109. Its enzyme activity was 48.3U/mg at 30 degrees C and 45.2U/mg at 42 degrees C. This ald gene was then cloned into a vector pNZ8148 to generate a vector pNZ8148/ald. The same ald gene was placed downstream of the ldh promoter from Streptococcus thermophilus to generate pNZ273/ldhp/ald. The pNZ8148/ald and pNZ273/ldhp/ald were introduced separately in Lactococcus lactis NZ9000. As a result of over-expressed ald, the production of alanine detected by HPLC in L. lactis NZ9000 carrying pNZ273/ldhp/ald reached 52mug/ml, an approximately 26-fold increase compared to the parent strain L. lactis NZ9000, but not in L. lactis NZ9000 carrying pNZ8148/ald. This study would help strain improvement to be used in dairy fermentation for developing healthy yogurts with sweet taste or other fermented dairy foods.
TI  - Possible promoter regions within the proteolytic system in Streptococcus thermophilus and their interaction with the CodY homolog.
AB  - Possible promoter regions preceding 14 genes belonging to the proteolytic system  of Streptococcus thermophilus KLDS 3.0503 were predicted by a promoter analysis software nnpp. The 14 genes included an extracellular protease gene prtS, an oligopeptide ABC transport system gene amiA1, and 12 genes, respectively, encoding peptidases pepA, pepS, pepN, pepC, pepB, pepQ, pepV, pepT, pepM, pepXP, pepP, and pepO. These predicted promoter sequences were cloned and inserted into the upstream of a promoterless Escherichia coli gusA (beta-glucuronidase) gene in a promoter probe vector pNZ273. The resulting vectors were, respectively, introduced into S. thermophilus KLDS 3.0503 and all 14 predicted promoter sequences were able to drive gusA expression, which indicated that these sequences were functional promoters. These promoters were able to interact with the S. thermophilus CodY homolog in an in vitro DNA binding assay but they did not contain a conserved CodY-box sequence identified in Lactococcus lactis. These results were useful for further studies on the regulation of protein metabolism in S. thermophilus.
TI  - Bacterial diversity of Darfiyeh, a Lebanese artisanal raw goat's milk cheese.
AB  - In order to contribute to the preservation of the Lebanese dairy heritage, the aim of this study was to characterize the Darfiyeh cheese, a traditional variety made from raw goat's milk and ripened in goat's skin. Three independent batches of Darfiyeh production were analyzed after 20, 40 and 60 days of ripening. Mesophilic lactobacilli, thermophilic coccal-shaped lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and thermophilic lactobacilli were enumerated. In order to explore the Darfiyeh natural ecosystem, a combination of phenotypical and molecular approaches was applied. The latter included Polymerase Chain Reaction-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (PCR-TTGE), classical PCR and quantitative PCR. These methods revealed the presence of Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus malodoratus, group D Streptococcus sp., Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and L. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus curvatus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Escherichia coli, Clostridium sp./Eubacterium tenue. Real-time PCR enabled quantification of E. faecium, with a detection of 10(7)-10(9) cfu g(-1) of product. The present molecular approaches combined with phenotypic method allowed describing the complex natural ecosystem of Darfiyeh, giving useful information for the preservation of Lebanese artisanal dairy products.
TI  - A DNA array based assay for the characterization of microbial community in raw milk.
AB  - An oligonucleotide array based on PCR method containing a combination of probes for taxonomic markers and species-specific virulence genes was developed for the simultaneous identification of 14 Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) and food-borne pathogenic bacteria in raw milk. The hypervariable regions V3 and V6 of 16S, together with a variable region of 23S rRNA genes and several genes specific for virulence factors were selected. Universal primers and multiplex PCR were used for the rapid differentiation of bacterial species and low concentration of specific pathogenic and spoilage bacteria were detected in milk. The dominant species such as Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, andLeuconostoc lactis were identified by indirect-labelling reactions based upon incorporation of amino-allyl dUTPs. The results regarding food-borne pathogens detection showed highly specific hybridisation patterns with the genomic DNA from Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Salmonella thyphimurium, Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia enterocolitica. A clear differentiation of dominant species present in a complex microbial community such as raw milk was achieved by the application of short oligonucleotide probes which discriminate sequences differing by few nucleotides.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a strain-dependent cystathionine beta/gamma-lyase in Lactobacillus casei potentially involved in cysteine biosynthesis.
AB  - The trans-sulfuration pathways allow the interconversion of cysteine and methionine with the intermediary formation of cystathionine and homocysteine. The genome database of Lactobacillus casei ATCC 334 provides evidence that this species cannot synthesize cysteine from methionine via the trans-sulfuration pathway. However, several L. casei strains use methionine as the sole sulfur source, which implies that these strains can convert methionine to cysteine. Cystathionine synthases and lyases play a crucial role in the trans-sulfuration pathway. By applying proteomic techniques, we have identified a protein in cell-free extracts of L. casei, which showed high homology to a gene product encoded in the genome of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus helveticus but not in the genome of L. casei ATCC 334. The presence of the gene was only found in strains able to grow on methionine as the sole sulfur source. Moreover, two gene variants were identified. Both gene variants were cloned and expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzymes exhibited cystathionine lyase activity in vitro and also cleaved cysteine, homocysteine and methionine releasing volatile sulfur compounds.
TI  - Tina wooden vat biofilm: a safe and highly efficient lactic acid bacteria delivering system in PDO Ragusano cheese making.
AB  - In the Sicilian PDO Ragusano cheese making, raw milk is placed in a wooden vat called a Tina. As no starter is added, lactic acid is produced by milk flora and flora released from the Tina biofilm. The aim of this work was to assess the safety and efficiency of this natural inoculation system. From 15 Tinas' biofilms, bacteria total counts varied from 10(3) to 10(6) CFU/cm(2), with the predominance of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria. Low counts of yeasts and moulds were found in a few Tinas. Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7 were totally absent, as assessed by conventional plating and the Bax detection system after enrichment, highlighting the safety of the system. From four Tinas out of the 15, micropieces of wood were observed by confocal and scanning electron microscopy. The biofilm entrapped in a matrix covered almost entirely the surface of the wood. Polysaccharides were detected in the four Tinas. In three of the latter, cocci were predominant in the ecosystem whereas in the other one, cocci, bacilli, yeasts and moulds were observed. Fifty litres of microfiltrated milk (<10 CFU/mL) were poured in the four Tinas for 10 min of contact. Enumeration of lactic acid bacteria, yeasts and enterococci were performed in the milk after contact. Depending on the Tina, from 5.10(4) to 10(6) CFU/mL of Streptococcus thermophilus were released into the milk, and from 10(4) to 10(5) CFU/mL of thermophilic lactobacilli. Spontaneous acidification after contact confirmed the high efficiency of biofilm lactic acid bacteria delivery.
TI  - Fluorescent-BOX-PCR for resolving bacterial genetic diversity, endemism and biogeography.
AB  - BACKGROUND: BOX-A1R-based repetitive extragenic palindromic-PCR (BOX-PCR) is one  of the most used techniques in biogeography studies of microbial isolates. However the traditional separation of BOX-PCR patterns by agarose gel electrophoresis suffers many limitations. The aim of this research was to set up a fluorescent BOX-PCR (F-BOX-PCR) assay in which separation of PCR products is automated in a capillary electrophoresis system. F-BOX-PCR was compared with the traditional BOX-PCR using bacterial strains with different G+C content (Bacillus cereus; Escherichia coli; isolates of the family Geodermatophilaceae). Resolution, discriminatory power and reproducibility were evaluated by assaying different electrophoretic runs, PCR reactions and independent DNA extractions. BOX-PCR and F-BOX-PCR were compared for the analysis of 29 strains of Modestobacter multiseptatus isolated from three different microsites in an altered carbonatic wall from Cagliari, Italy, and 45 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus isolated from 34 samples of the hand-made, yogurt-like product Matsoni, collected in different locations in Georgia. RESULTS: Fluorophore 6-FAM proved more informative than HEX and BOX-PCR both in agarose gel electrophoresis (p < 0.004 and p < 0.00003) and in capillary electrophoresis (compared only with HEX, p < 2 x 10(-7)). 6-FAM- and HEX-based F-BOX-PCR respectively detected up to 12.0 and 11.3 times more fragments than BOX-PCR. Replicate separations of F-BOX-PCR showed an accuracy of the size calling of +/- 0.5 bp until 500 bp, constantly decreasing to +/- 10 bp at 2000 bp. Cluster analysis of F-BOX-PCR profiles grouped M. multiseptatus strains according to the microsite of isolation and S. thermophilus strains according to the geographical origin of Matsoni, but resulted intermixed when a BOX-PCR dataset was used. CONCLUSION: F-BOX-PCR represents an improved method for addressing bacterial biogeography studies both in term of sensitivity, reproducibility and data analysis.
TI  - Therapeutic potential of two probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease as observed in the trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid model of colitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease is thought to be a multifactorial process. One of the leading hypotheses is that an imbalance in normal gut flora induces an excessive immune response and contributes to inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. Administration of probiotic bacteria reduces symptoms in patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases, probably via both manipulation of the microflora and stimulation of the intestinal immune system. In the current study the therapeutic potential of two different probiotics-Lactobacillus GG and a mixture of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium longum (YO-MIX Y 109 FRO 1000)--in a rat model of colitis were evaluated. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were administered probiotics for three days simultaneously with colitis induction. Colonic damage was evaluated histologically and biochemically and colonic tissues, as well as fecal samples, were used for bacterial studies using 16S rRNA gene primers. RESULTS: Probiotics administration reduced the relative amounts of the pathogenic bacteria Aeromonas and Escherichia coli in the colonic tissue. However, whereas both probiotics affected colon morphology, only Lactobacillus GG administration reduced myeloperoxidase activity. CONCLUSIONS: We report the therapeutic rather than preventive potential of two different probiotics in an animal model of colitis.
TI  - Antibacterial action of selenium-enriched probiotics against pathogenic Escherichia coli.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory activity of selenium-enriched probiotics against pathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) in vitro and in vivo. Escherichia coli was co-cultured in vitro with each probiotic strain individually, and a mixture of the four strains and its population was counted at various time points. We also collected a cell-free culture supernatant (CFCS) of each probiotic strain and the four-strain mix to examine their antibacterial activity, using the cylinder plate method. Results demonstrated that co-culture with probiotics significantly reduced the number of E. coli. The different sizes of the inhibition zones made by each CFCS proved that E. coli was inhibited by the metabolites of the probiotics. In vivo, Kunming mice were allocated to different groups supplemented with selenium-enriched and other probiotics. After 28 days, the mice were inoculated with pathogenic E. coli so that we could compare mortality rates and inspect other indexes of each treatment. The mortality of the group with selenium-enriched probiotics was the lowest. In addition, the organic antioxidant status improved, immunity was fortified, and the internal environment of the intestinal tract was enhanced with selenium-enriched probiotic supplementation. In conclusion, selenium-enriched probiotics can strongly antagonize pathogenic E. coli in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Serine hydroxymethyl transferase from Streptococcus thermophilus and L-threonine  aldolase from Escherichia coli as stereocomplementary biocatalysts for the synthesis of beta-hydroxy-alpha,omega-diamino acid derivatives.
AB  - A novel serine hydroxymethyl transferase from Streptococcus thermophilus (SHMT) and a L-threonine aldolase from Escherichia coli (LTA) were used as stereocomplementary biocatalysts for the aldol addition of glycine to N-Cbz amino aldehydes and benzyloxyacetaldehyde (Cbz=benzyloxycarbonyl). Both threonine aldolases were classified as low-specific L-allo-threonine aldolases, and by manipulating reaction parameters, such as temperature, glycine concentration, and reaction media, SHMT yielded exclusively L-erythro diastereomers in 34-60 % conversion, whereas LTA gave L-threo diastereomers in 30:70 to 16:84 diastereomeric ratios and with 40-68 % conversion to product. SHMT is among the most stereoselective L-threonine aldolases described. This is due, among other things, to its activity-temperature dependence: at 4 degrees C SHMT has high synthetic activity but negligible retroaldol activity on L-threonine. Thus, the kinetic L-erythro isomer was largely favored and the reactions were virtually irreversible, highly stereoselective, and in turn, gave excellent conversion. It was also found that treatment of the prepared N-Cbz-gamma-amino-beta-hydroxy-alpha-amino acid derivatives with potassium hydroxide (1 m) resulted in the spontaneous formation of 2-oxazolidinone derivatives of the beta-hydroxyl and gamma-amino groups in quantitative yield. This reaction might be useful for further chemical manipulations of the products.
TI  - Probiotic Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris and Streptococcus thermophilus  induce IL-12 and IFN-gamma production.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the capacity of potentially probiotic strains from six bacterial genera to induce cytokine production alone or in combinations in order to identify potential enhancing or synergistic effects in order to select probiotic bacteria for in vivo purposes. METHODS: Cytokine production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in response to stimulation with eleven different potentially probiotic bacterial strains from Streptococcus, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc and Propionibacterium genera was analysed. Production and mRNA expression of TNF-alpha, IL-12, IFN-gamma and IL-10 were determined by ELISA and Northern blotting, respectively. RESULTS: All tested bacteria induced TNF-alpha production. The best inducers of Th1 type cytokines IL-12 and IFN-gamma were Streptococcus and Leuconostoc strains. All Bifidobacterium and Propionibacterium strains induced higher IL-10 production than other studied bacteria. Stimulation of PBMC with any bacterial combinations did not result in enhanced cytokine production suggesting that different bacteria whether gram-positive or gram-negative compete with each other during host cell interactions. CONCLUSION: The probiotic S. thermophilus and Leuconostoc strains are more potent inducers of Th1 type cytokines IL-12 and IFN-gamma than the probiotic Lactobacillus strains. Bacterial combinations did not result in enhanced cytokine production.
TI  - The inhibitory spectrum of thermophilin 9 from Streptococcus thermophilus LMD-9 depends on the production of multiple peptides and the activity of BlpG(St), a thiol-disulfide oxidase.
AB  - The blp(St) cluster of Streptococcus thermophilus LMD-9 was recently shown to contain all the genetic information required for the production of bacteriocins active against other S. thermophilus strains. In this study, we further investigated the antimicrobial activity of S. thermophilus LMD-9 by testing the susceptibility of 31 bacterial species (87 strains). We showed that LMD-9 displays an inhibitory spectrum targeted toward related gram-positive bacteria, including pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes. Using deletion mutants, we investigated the contribution of the three putative bacteriocin-encoding operons blpD(St)-orf2, blpU(St)-orf3, and blpE(St)-blpF(St) (bac(St) operons) and of the blpG(St) gene, which encodes a putative modification protein, to the inhibitory spectrum and immunity of strain LMD-9. Our results present evidence that the blp(St) locus encodes a multipeptide bacteriocin system called thermophilin 9. Among the four class II bacteriocin-like peptides encoded within the bac(St) operons, BlpD(St) alone was sufficient to inhibit the growth of most thermophilin 9-sensitive species. The blpD(St) gene forms an operon with its associated immunity gene(s), and this functional bacteriocin/immunity module could easily be transferred to Lactococcus lactis. The remaining three Bac(St) peptides, BlpU(St), BlpE(St), and BlpF(St), confer poor antimicrobial activity but act as enhancers of the antagonistic activity of thermophilin 9 by an unknown mechanism. The blpG(St) gene was also shown to be specifically required for the antilisteria activity of thermophilin 9, since its deletion abolished the sensitivities of most Listeria species. By complementation of the motility deficiency of Escherichia coli dsbA, we showed that blpG(St) encodes a functional thiol-disulfide oxidase, suggesting an important role for disulfide bridges within thermophilin 9.
TI  - Overexpression, physicochemical characterization, and modeling of a hyperthermophilic pyrococcus furiosus type 2 IPP isomerase.
AB  - In the first step of this study, type 2 isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IDI2)  from Pyrococcus furiosus (pf-IDI2), a hyperthermophilic microorganism, was cloned and overexpressed in E. coli. After purification, hyperthermophilic behavior of this protein was approached by means of enzymatic assays and thermal denaturation studies. Compared with the mesophilic Streptococcus pneumoniae IDI2, which unfolds and looses activity above 50 degrees C, pf-IDI2 is still folded and active at 80 degrees C. Molecular modeling was applied, in a parallel step, to understand the molecular basis of thermal stability. Comparison of IDI2 from S. pneumoniae, T. thermophilus, and P. furiosus suggested that additional charged residues present in the hyperthermophilic enzyme might contribute to its higher thermal stability. This could increase the number of salt bridges between monomers of IDI2 in P. furiosus enzyme and, hence, decrease flexibility of loops or N-terminal segment, thereby enhancing its thermal stability.
TI  - Characterisation of pSMA23, a 3.5 kbp plasmid of Lactobacillus casei, and application for heterologous expression in Lactobacillus.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of plasmid pSMA23 isolated from Lactobacillus casei A23 was determined. Plasmid pSMA23 is a 3497bp circular molecule with a G+C content of 38.18%. Four putative open reading frames were identified. Based on homology, two orfs were identified as genes encoding replication initiation (Rep) and mobilisation (Mob) protein, respectively. Various regulatory regions like promoters, ribosome binding site (RBS), transcriptional terminators were deduced from the sequences of rep and mob. The origin of replication (dso) was predicted. Shuttle vectors pL142 and pL157 were constructed for Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus using rep gene and ori of pSMA23 for replication in Lactobacillus, the ori of the commercial vector pBluescript SkII+ for replication in E. coli, and the erythromycin and chloramphenicol resistance genes of pE194 and pC194, respectively, as selection markers. Transformants of E. coli and Lactobacillus were obtained on media containing erythromycin and chloramphenicol, respectively, suggesting expression of the ermC and cat194 genes in both organisms. The shsp gene of plasmid pSt04 of Streptococcus thermophilus encoding a small heat shock protein and the Lactobacillus plantarum cbh gene encoding conjugated bile salts hydrolase were cloned and successfully expressed in the heterologous host Lb. casei LK1 with the aid of pSMA23-derived vectors.
TI  - Comparative sequence analysis of plasmids from Lactobacillus delbrueckii and construction of a shuttle cloning vector.
AB  - While plasmids are very commonly associated with the majority of the lactic acid  bacteria, they are only very rarely associated with Lactobacillus delbrueckii, with only four characterized to date. In this study, the complete sequence of a native plasmid, pDOJ1, from a strain of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was determined. It consisted of a circular DNA molecule of 6,220 bp with a G+C content of 44.6% and a characteristic ori and encoded six open reading frames (ORFs), of which functions could be predicted for three-a mobilization (Mob) protein, a transposase, and a fused primase-helicase replication protein. Comparative analysis of pDOJ1 and the other available L. delbrueckii plasmids (pLBB1, pJBL2, pN42, and pLL1212) revealed a very similar organization and amino acid identities between 85 and 98% for the putative proteins of all six predicted ORFs from pDOJ1, reflecting a common origin for L. delbrueckii plasmids. Analysis of the fused primase-helicase replication gene found a similar fused organization only in the theta replicating group B plasmids from Streptococcus thermophilus. This observation and the ability of the replicon to function in S. thermophilus support the idea that the origin of plasmids in L. delbrueckii was likely from S. thermophilus. This may reflect the close association of these two species in dairy fermentations, particularly yogurt production. As no vector based on plasmid replicons from L. delbrueckii has previously been constructed, an Escherichia coli-L. delbrueckii shuttle cloning vector, pDOJ4, was constructed from pDOJ1, the p15A ori, the chloramphenicol resistance gene of pCI372, and the lacZ polylinker from pUC18. This cloning vector was successfully introduced into E. coli, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, S. thermophilus, and Lactococcus lactis. This shuttle cloning vector provides a new tool for molecular analysis of Lactobacillus delbrueckii and other lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Biopreservation by Lactobacillus paracasei in coculture with Streptococcus thermophilus in potentially probiotic and synbiotic fresh cream cheeses.
AB  - The viability of Lactobacillus paracasei and its effect on growth of the microbiota in potentially probiotic and synbiotic fresh cheeses during storage at 4 +/- 1 degree C was investigated. Three cheese-making trials (T1, T2, and T3) were prepared in quadruplicate, all supplemented with a Streptococcus thermophilus culture. L. paracasei subsp. paracasei was added to cheeses in T1 and T2, and inulin was added to cheeses in T2. Counts of L. paracasei, S. thermophilus, coliforms, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus spp., DNase-positive Staphylococcus, and yeasts and molds were monitored during storage for up to 21 days. Viable counts of L. paracasei in probiotic (T1) and synbiotic (T2) cheeses remained above 7 log CFU/g during the entire storage period, whereas counts of S. thermophilus remained above 9.5 log CFU/g for cheeses from TI, T2, and T3. Populations of coliforms, Staphylococcus spp., and DNase-positive Staphylococcus were higher in T3 cheese and differed significantly from those in cheeses from T1 and T2 (P < 0.05). Inhibition of contaminants prevailed when both L. paracasei and S. thermophilus were present in fresh cream cheese and probably was due to acid production by both strains; bacteriocin production was not found. Addition of inulin in T2 did not impact microbial viability (P > 0.05). L. paracasei subsp. paracasei in coculture with S. thermophilus was inhibitory against microbial contaminants in fresh cream cheese with or without the addition of inulin, indicating the potential use of this combination in a probiotic and synbiotic product.
TI  - [Probiotics in chronic inflammatory bowel disease].
AB  - Current data show that probiotics are more effective in preventing the recrudescence of an inflammatory process than in suppressing active disease. This is reflected in the solid evidence for the effect of E. coli Nissle 1917 (Mutaflor) in the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis, and of VSL#3 in preventing the recurrence of pouchitis. These indications have since been incorporated in valid guidelines. Initial clinical studies have also provided promising results regarding the efficacy of VSL#3 in preventing pouchitis immediately following proctocolectomy.
TI  - Transcriptional analysis of the recA gene of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: RecA is a highly conserved prokaryotic protein that not only plays several important roles connected to DNA metabolism but also affects the cell response to various stress conditions. While RecA is highly conserved, the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of its structural gene is less conserved. In Escherichia coli the LexA protein acts as a recA repressor and is able, in response to DNA damage, of RecA-promoted self-cleavage, thus allowing recA transcription. The LexA paradigm, although confirmed in a wide number of cases, is not universally valid. In some cases LexA does not control recA transcription while in other RecA-containing bacteria a LexA homologue is not present. RESULTS: We have studied the recA transcriptional regulation in S. thermophilus, a bacterium that does not contain a LexA homologue. We have characterized the promoter region of the gene and observed that its expression is strongly induced by DNA damage. The analysis of deletion mutants and of translational gene fusions showed that a DNA region of 83 base pairs, containing the recA promoter and the transcriptional start site, is sufficient to ensure normal expression of the gene. Unlike LexA of E. coli, the factor controlling recA expression in S. thermophilus acts in a RecA-independent way since recA induction was observed in a strain carrying a recA null mutation. CONCLUSION: In S. thermophilus, as in many other bacteria,recA expression is strongly induced by DNA damage, however, in this organism expression of the gene is controlled by a factor different from those well characterized in other bacteria. A small DNA region extending from 62 base pairs upstream of the recA transcriptional start site to 21 base pairs downstream of it carries all the information needed for normal regulation of the S. thermophilus recA gene.
TI  - Yoghurt fermentation at elevated temperatures by strains of Streptococcus thermophilus expressing a small heat-shock protein: application of a two-plasmid system for constructing food-grade strains of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus S4 expressing a small heat-shock protein from the plasmid pSt04-encoded copy of shsp, is able to carry out fermentation at elevated temperature, i.e., at 50 degrees C. In yoghurt culture together with Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, fermentation at elevated temperature results in a mild yoghurt with low post-acidification and improved stability of the starter bacteria during storage at 4 degrees C. To transfer pSt04 into commercial S. thermophilus yoghurt starter strains, a two-plasmid system was constructed. A helper plasmid providing a selectable antibiotic marker, but relying on the repA gene of pSt04, was transformed together with pSt04. After isolation of transformants, the helper plasmid was readily lost upon incubation of transformants in antibiotic-free medium, thus yielding food-grade strains carrying pSt04 only. Successful application of the system was demonstrated.
TI  - The ltp gene of temperate Streptococcus thermophilus phage TP-J34 confers superinfection exclusion to Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - The ltp gene, located within the lysogeny module of temperate Streptococcus thermophilus phage TP-J34, has been shown to be expressed in lysogenic strain S. thermophilus J34. It codes for a lipoprotein, as demonstrated by inhibition of cleavage of the signal sequence by globomycin. Exposure of Ltp on the surface of Lactococcus lactis protoplasts bearing a plasmid-encoded copy of ltp has been demonstrated by immunogold labeling and electron microscopy. Expression of ltp in prophage- and plasmid-cured S. thermophilus J34-6f interfered with TP-J34 infection. While plating efficiency was reduced by a factor of about 40 and lysis of strain J34-6f in liquid medium was delayed considerably, phage adsorption was not affected at all. Intracellular accumulation of phage DNA was shown to be inhibited by Ltp. This indicates interference of Ltp with infection at the stage of triggering DNA release and injection into the cell, indicating a role of Ltp in superinfection exclusion. Expression of ltp in L. lactis Bu2-60 showed that the same superinfection exclusion mechanism was strongly effective against phage P008, a member of the lactococcal 936 phage species: no plaque-formation was detectable with even 10(9) phage per ml applied, and lysis in liquid medium did not occur. In Lactococcus also, Ltp apparently inhibited phage DNA release and/or injection. Ltp appears to be a member of a family of small, secreted proteins with a 42 amino acids repeat structure encoded by genes of Gram-positive bacteria. Some of these homologous genes are part of the genomes of prophages.
TI  - Bifidobacterium breve and Streptococcus thermophilus secretion products enhance T helper 1 immune response and intestinal barrier in mice.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria or their secretion products can modulate immune responses differently in normal and inflammatory conditions. This comparative study analyzes the effect of oral administration of living lactic acid bacteria, or their conditioned media, on the epithelial and immune functions of colitis-prone C57BL/6 IL-10-deficient mice. Mice were untreated (control) or infected with Helicobacter hepaticus with or without oral treatment with living bacteria, Bifidobacterium breve C50 and Streptococcus thermophilus 065 (LB), or their culture-conditioned media (CM). Histology, cytokine mRNA, electrical resistance, and barrier capacity of colonic samples as well as cytokine secretion by mesenteric lymph node (MLN) cells were studied. Helicobacter hepaticus mice developed only mild colitis, which was not modified in LB or CM groups. In the CM (but not the LB) group, the colonic barrier was reinforced as compared to the other groups, as evidenced by decreased horseradish peroxidase (HRP) transcytosis and mannitol fluxes and increased electrical resistance. In MLN, the percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells secreting IFNgamma was significantly higher in CM (2.06% and 1.98%, respectively) mice than in H. hepaticus (1.1% and 0.47%, P < 0.05) or control mice. In addition, the nonspecific stimulation of IFNgamma, TNFalpha, and IL-12 secretion by MLN cells was significantly higher in the CM group as compared to the other groups. In the absence of severe colitis, Bifidobacterium breve C50- and Streptococcus thermophilus 065-conditioned media can reinforce intestinal barrier capacity and stimulate Th1 immune response, highlighting the involvement of lactic acid bacteria-derived components in host defense.
TI  - Functional interactions between the subunits of the lactose transporter from Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Although the quaternary state has been assessed in detail for only a few members  of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), it is clear that multiple oligomeric states are represented within the MFS. One of its members, the lactose transporter LacS from Streptococcus thermophilus assumes a dimeric structure in the membrane and in vitro analysis showed functional interactions between both subunits when proton motive force ((Delta)p)-driven transport was assayed. To study the interactions in further detail, a covalent dimer was constructed consisting of in tandem fused LacS subunits. These covalent dimers, composed of active and completely inactive subunits, were expressed in Escherichia coli, and initial rates of (Delta)p-driven lactose uptake and lactose counterflow were determined. We now show that also in vivo, both subunits interact functionally; that is, partial complementation of the inactive subunit was observed for both transport modes. Thus, both subunits interact functionally in (Delta)p-driven uptake and in counterflow transport. In addition, analysis of in tandem fused LacS subunits containing one regulatory LacS-IIA domain showed that regulation is primarily an intramolecular event.
TI  - Effect of fermented milk containing probiotic bacteria in the prevention of an enteroinvasive Escherichia coli infection in mice.
AB  - This study investigated the protective capacity of the oral administration of fermented milk containing the probiotic strains; Lactobacillus casei, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, against enteroinvasive Escherichia coli infection in a murine (BALB/ c mice) model. Mice were fed for 2, 5 or 7 consecutive days with fermented milk diluted to a concentration of viable Lb. casei, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Strep. thermophilus of 10(7) cfu/ml. Phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages and the number of IgA+ cells in small and large intestine were determined at the end of the feeding periods. For the preventive effect against Esch. coli, animals were fed for 5 days (selected dose). Mice were challenged with an infective dose of enteroinvasive Esch. coli of 10(8) cfu/mouse. The colonization of liver and spleen and the secretory IgA specific for the pathogen in the intestinal fluid were determined (ELISA test). Results showed that the unspecific immune response enhanced itself after 5 consecutive days of the administration of this fermented milk (increase in the percentage of phagocytosis and number of IgA+ cells in the small intestine). Treated animals showed less Esch. coli colonization of liver than control mice and a higher secretory anti-Esch. coli IgA in the intestinal fluids. These results suggest that the protection against enteroinvasive Esch. coli infection observed for the fermented milk containing probiotic bacteria may be associated with an enhance of the intestinal mucosa immunity.
TI  - Characterization of a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus faecium GM-1 isolated  from an infant.
AB  - AIM: To partially characterize the bacteriocin produced by the GM-1 strain of Enterococcus faecium, isolated from the faeces of a newborn human infant. METHODS AND RESULTS: The bacteriocin produced by E. faecium GM-1 showed a broad spectrum of activity against indicator strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio spp., Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. Treatment of the GM-1 bacteriocin with proteolytic enzymes reduced its inhibitory activities. The bacteriocin was stable at 100 degrees C for 20 min and displayed inhibitory activity at neutral pH. The optimal production of bacteriocin from E. faecium GM-1 was obtained when the culture conditions were pH 6.0-6.5 and 35-40 degrees C. The inhibitory activity of the bacteriocin was not substantially changed by the use of different carbon sources in the media, except when galactose was substituted for glucose. The use of a sole nitrogen source caused a decrease in inhibitory activity. A bacteriocin gene similar to enterocin P was identified from the total DNA of E. faecium GM-1 by PCR and direct sequencing methods. CONCLUSION: E. faecium GM-1, which was isolated from the faeces of a newborn baby, produces an enterocin P-like bacteriocin with inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including food-borne pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: E. faecium GM-1, isolated from infant faeces, produces a new bacteriocin that is similar to enterocin P. This bacteriocin is heat stable and has a broad antibacterial spectrum that includes both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Characterization of the cro-ori region of the Streptococcus thermophilus virulent bacteriophage DT1.
AB  - The virulent cos-type Streptococcus thermophilus phage DT1 was previously isolated from a mozzarella whey sample, and its complete genomic sequence is available. The putative ori of phage DT1 is characterized by three inverted and two direct repeats located in a noncoding region between orf36 and orf37. As the replication ability of the putative ori and flanking genes could not be established, its ability to confer phage resistance was tested. When ori is cloned on a high-copy-number plasmid, it provides protection to S. thermophilus strains against phage infection during milk fermentation. This protection is phage specific and strain dependent. Then, a detailed transcriptional map was established for the region located between the cro-like gene (orf29) and the ori. The results of the Northern blots indicated that the transcription of this region started 5 min after the onset of phage infection. Comparative analysis of the expression of the cro-ori region in the three S. thermophilus cos-type phages DT1, Sfi19 (virulent), and Sfi21 (temperate) reveals significant differences in the number and size of transcripts. The promoter upstream of orf29 was further investigated by primer extension analysis, and its activity was confirmed by a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay, which showed that the phage promoter is more efficient than the constitutive bacterial promoter of the S. thermophilus operon encoding the general proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system. However, the phage promoter is less efficient than the pts promoter in Lactococcus lactis and in Escherichia coli.
TI  - Recombinant production of serine hydroxymethyl transferase from Streptococcus thermophilus and its preliminary evaluation as a biocatalyst.
AB  - The glyA gene encoding a serine hydroxymethyl transferase (SHMT) with threonine aldolase activity was isolated from Streptococcus thermophilus YKA-184 chromosomal DNA. This aldolase is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme that stereospecifically catalyzes the interconversion of L-threonine to glycine and acetaldehyde. The enzyme was overexpressed in Escherichia coli M15 as a recombinant protein of 45 kDa with a His6-tag at its N-terminus. The recombinant enzyme was purified to homogeneity by a single chromatographic step using Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity, obtaining a high activity-recovery yield (83%). Lyophilized and precipitated enzymes were stable at least for 10 weeks when stored at -20 degrees C and 4 degrees C. It was observed that the Km for L-allo-threonine was 38-fold higher than that for L-threonine, suggesting this enzyme can be classified as a specific L-allo-threonine aldolase. The optimum pH range of threonine aldolase activity for the recombinant SHMT was pH 6-7. When tested for aldol addition reactions with non-natural aldehydes, such as benzyloxyacetaldehyde and (R)-N-Cbz-alaninal, two possible beta-hydroxy-alpha-amino acid diastereoisomers were produced, but with moderate stereospecificity. The enzyme showed potential as a biocatalyst for the stereoselective synthesis of beta-hydroxy-alpha-amino acids.
TI  - Molecular identification of monomeric aspartate racemase from Bifidobacterium bifidum.
AB  - Bifidobacterium bifidum is a useful probiotic agent exhibiting health-promoting properties and contains d-aspartate as an essential component of the cross-linker moiety in the peptidoglycan. To help understand D-aspartate biosynthesis in B. bifidum NBRC 14252, aspartate racemase, which catalyzes the racemization of D- and L-aspartate, was purified to homogeneity and characterized. The enzyme was a monomer with a molecular mass of 27 kDa. This is the first report showing the presence of a monomeric aspartate racemase. Its enzymologic properties, such as its lack of cofactor requirement and susceptibility to thiol-modifying reagents in catalysis, were similar to those of the dimeric aspartate racemase from Streptococcus thermophilus. The monomeric enzyme, however, showed a novel characteristic, namely, that its thermal stability significantly increased in the presence of aspartate, especially the D-enantiomer. The gene encoding the monomeric aspartate racemase was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells. The nucleotide sequence of the aspartate racemase gene encoded a peptide containing 241 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 26 784 Da. The recombinant enzyme was purified to homogeneity and its properties were almost the same as those of the B. bifidum enzyme.
TI  - Comparison of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase gene (fbp) sequences for the identification of Lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  - Comparative analysis of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase gene (fbp) sequences was evaluated for the differentiation of reference and clinical strains of Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The sequences of 1,971 nucleotides of the fbp gene were determined on both DNA strands for 21 L. rhamnosus strains, representing reference, probiotic, and clinical strains. No PCR amplification of the fbp gene was observed for other species of the Lactobacillus casei complex (L. casei and L. zeae) or strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Escherichia coli. Phylogenetic analysis of the fbp putative amino acid sequences of L. rhamnosus strains by the neighbor-joining method showed clear distinct positions of this species. The phylogenetic tree, derived from fbp nucleotide sequences, showed four clear divisions between strains of L. rhamnosus. From a taxonomic point of view, our results confirm for the first time that fbp gene sequences have high discriminating power for strains of L. rhamnosus that are difficult to differentiate.
TI  - Expression of a heterologous manganese superoxide dismutase gene in intestinal lactobacilli provides protection against hydrogen peroxide toxicity.
AB  - In living organisms, exposure to oxygen provokes oxidative stress. A widespread mechanism for protection against oxidative stress is provided by the antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutases (SODs) and hydroperoxidases. Generally, these enzymes are not present in Lactobacillus spp. In this study, we examined the potential advantages of providing a heterologous SOD to some of the intestinal lactobacilli. Thus, the gene encoding the manganese-containing SOD (sodA) was cloned from Streptococcus thermophilus AO54 and expressed in four intestinal lactobacilli. A 1.2-kb PCR product containing the sodA gene was cloned into the shuttle vector pTRK563, to yield pSodA, which was functionally expressed and complemented an Escherichia coli strain deficient in Mn and FeSODs. The plasmid, pSodA, was subsequently introduced and expressed in Lactobacillus gasseri NCK334, Lactobacillus johnsonii NCK89, Lactobacillus acidophilus NCK56, and Lactobacillus reuteri NCK932. Molecular and biochemical analyses confirmed the presence of the gene (sodA) and the expression of an active gene product (MnSOD) in these strains of lactobacilli. The specific activities of MnSOD were 6.7, 3.8, 5.8, and 60.7 U/mg of protein for L. gasseri, L. johnsonii, L. acidophilus, and L. reuteri, respectively. The expression of S. thermophilus MnSOD in L. gasseri and L. acidophilus provided protection against hydrogen peroxide stress. The data show that MnSOD protects cells against hydrogen peroxide by removing O(2)(.-) and preventing the redox cycling of iron. To our best knowledge, this is the first report of a sodA from S. thermophilus being expressed in other lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Assessment of enzymatic cleaning agents and disinfectants against bacterial biofilms.
AB  - PURPOSE: Microbial biofilm has become difficult to control by antibiotic and biocide regimes that are effective against suspended bacteria. Their colonization of surfaces can be a problem and is generally controlled through cleaning and disinfection. This study was undertaken to examine the efficacy of the disinfectants including Bio-Ow, Econase CE, Gamanase GC 140, IndiAge 44L, Mannanase AMB, Multifect P-3000, Neutrase, Pandion, Paradigm, Pectinex Ultra SP-L, Promozyme, Resinase A2X, Spezyme AA300, Spezyme GA300 and Vinozym EC, and the proteinase against bacterial biofilms. METHODS: The effectiveness of 20 commercial disinfectants against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) biofilms using a fluorometric technique was examined. Additionally the disinfectants were also tested against Lactobacillus bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus), Lactobacillus lactis (L. lactis) and Streptococcus thermophilus (S. thermophilus) isolates using microtitration tray based turbidimetric techniques. Escherichia coli (E. coli) was used as the test bacteria in the fluorometric control method. RESULTS: Among the first group of the enzymatic cleaning agents tested, four disinfectants (Pandion, Resinase A2X, Spezyme GA300 and Paradigm) were the most potent against bacterial biofilms after 30 min incubation time (residual bacterial count less than 10(3) CFU (colony forming units)/ml). However, only Resinase A2X and Paradigm showed a good effect on bacterial biofilms after 15 min incubation time. Proteinase disinfectants (alkalase, chymotrypsin, cryotin and krilltrypsin) from the second group of the disinfectants showed a good effect against P. aeruginosa biofilm when tested in the absence of milk. The performance of the disinfectants was reduced in the presence of milk. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the cleaning agents was determined as the lowest concentration inhibiting bacterial growth. The MIC was tested on Lactobacillus bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus), Lactobacillus lactis (L. lactis) and Streptococcus thermophilus (S. thermophilus) isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for Paradigm against S. thermophilus and L. Lactis were lower than L. Bulgaricus. Whereas, the MIC of Pandion against L. bulgaricus was lower than MIC against L. lactis. Resinase A2X had no inhibitory effect on bacterial growth when the concentration was less than or equal to 2.4 mg/ml and Spezyme GA 300 concentration less than or equal to 7.3 mg/ml. Minimum inhibitory concentration of Pandion against L. bulgaricus was 2.7 microg/ml and against L. lactis 5.3 microg/ml. Growth of S. thermophilus was inhibited in all concentration of Pandion tested. CONCLUSIONS: The choice of disinfectant or cleaning agent along with the optimum concentration and the time of action is very important when destroying microbes. It is also important that the resistances of microbes to different disinfectants and cleaning agents be taken into account when planning the cleaning process
TI  - Isolation of a minireplicon of the virulence plasmid pXO2 of Bacillus anthracis and characterization of the plasmid-encoded RepS replication protein.
AB  - A minireplicon of plasmid pXO2 of Bacillus anthracis was isolated by molecular cloning in Escherichia coli and shown to replicate in B. anthracis, Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus subtilis. The pXO2 replicon included (i) an open reading frame encoding the putative RepS replication initiation protein and (ii) the putative origin of replication. The RepS protein was expressed as a fusion with the maltose binding protein (MBP) at its amino-terminal end and purified by affinity chromatography. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the purified MBP-RepS protein bound specifically to a 60-bp region corresponding to the putative origin of replication of pXO2 located immediately downstream of the RepS open reading frame. Competition DNA binding experiments showed that the 5' and central regions of the putative origin were important for RepS binding. MBP-RepS also bound nonspecifically to single-stranded DNA with a lower affinity.
TI  - Sugar utilisation and conservation of the gal-lac gene cluster in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The adaptation to utilise lactose as primary carbon and energy source is a characteristic for Streptococcus thermophilus. These organisms, however only utilise the glucose moiety of lactose while the galactose moiety is excreted into the growth medium. In this study we evaluated the diversity of sugar utilisation and the conservation of the gal-lac gene cluster in a collection of 18 S. thermophilus strains isolated from a variety of sources. For this purpose analysis was performed on DNA from these isolates and the results were compared with those obtained with a strain from which the complete genome sequence has been determined. The sequence, organisation and flanking regions of the S. thermophilus gal-lac gene cluster were found to be highly conserved among all strains. The vast majority of the S. thermophilus strains were able to utilize only glucose, lactose, and sucrose as carbon sources, some strains could also utilize fructose and two of these were able to grow on galactose. Molecular characterisation of these naturally occurring Gal+ strains revealed up-mutations in the galKTE promoter that were absent in all other strains. These data support the hypothesis that the loss of the ability to ferment galactose can be attributed to the low activity of the galKTE promoter, probably as a consequence of the adaptation to milk in which the lactose levels are in excess.
TI  - Molecular characterization and functional analysis of the manganese-containing superoxide dismutase gene (sodA) from Streptococcus thermophilus AO54.
AB  - This report describes the isolation, sequencing, and functional analysis of the sodA gene, encoding Mn-superoxide dismutase, from Streptococcus thermophilus AO54. The gene was found to encode a 201 amino acid polypeptide with 88 and 83% identity to SodA from Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus agalacticae, respectively. Primer extension analysis revealed a transcriptional start site 27 nucleotides upstream of initiation codon. The gene was expressed in Escherichia coli and was able to rescue the growth of a sodAsodB mutant in a minimal-medium containing 10(-6)M paraquat. A sodA mutant of S. thermophilus was constructed and found to be more sensitive to aerobic growth than its parent strain. Supplementing the medium with MnCl(2) improved the growth of the mutant, only under microaerophilic conditions. The results suggest that sodA is essential for the aerobic growth of S. thermophilus. In the absence of functional SodA, manganese ions may provide partial protection against oxygen toxicity.
TI  - Phosphorylation of Streptococcus salivarius lactose permease (LacS) by HPr(His ~  P) and HPr(Ser-P)(His ~ P) and effects on growth.
AB  - The oral bacterium Streptococcus salivarius takes up lactose via a transporter called LacS that shares 95% identity with the LacS from Streptococcus thermophilus, a phylogenetically closely related organism. S. thermophilus releases galactose into the medium during growth on lactose. Expulsion of galactose is mediated via LacS and stimulated by phosphorylation of the transporter by HPr(His approximately P), a phosphocarrier of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase transport system (PTS). Unlike S. thermophilus, S. salivarius grew on lactose without expelling galactose and took up galactose and lactose concomitantly when it is grown in a medium containing both sugars. Analysis of the C-terminal end of S. salivarius LacS revealed a IIA-like domain (IIA(LacS)) almost identical to the IIA domain of S. thermophilus LacS. Experiments performed with purified proteins showed that S. salivarius IIA(LacS) was reversibly phosphorylated on a histidine residue at position 552 not only by HPr(His approximately P) but also by HPr(Ser-P)(His approximately P), a doubly phosphorylated form of HPr present in large amounts in rapidly growing S. salivarius cells. Two other major S. salivarius PTS proteins, IIAB(L)(Man) and IIAB(H)(Man), were unable to phosphorylate IIA(LacS). The effect of LacS phosphorylation on growth was studied with strain G71, an S. salivarius enzyme I-negative mutant that cannot synthesize HPr(His approximately P) or HPr(Ser-P)(His approximately P). These results indicated that (i) the wild-type and mutant strains had identical generation times on lactose, (ii) neither strain expelled galactose during growth on lactose, (iii) both strains metabolized lactose and galactose concomitantly when grown in a medium containing both sugars, and (iv) the growth of the mutant was slightly reduced on galactose.
TI  - Identification of the dimer interface of the lactose transport protein from Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The lactose transporter from Streptococcus thermophilus catalyses the symport of  galactosides and protons. The carrier domain of the protein harbours the contact sites for dimerization, and the individual subunits in the dimer interact functionally during the transport reaction. As a first step towards the elucidation of the mechanism behind the cooperation between the subunits, regions involved in the dimer interface were determined by oxidative and chemical cross-linking of 12 cysteine substitution mutants. Four positions in the protein were found to be susceptible to intermolecular cross-linking. To ensure that the observed cross-links were not the result of randomly colliding particles, the cross-linking was studied in samples in which either the concentration of LacS in the membrane was varied or the oligomeric state was manipulated. These experiments showed that the cross-links were formed specifically within the dimer. The four regions of the protein located at the dimer interface are close to the extracellular ends of transmembrane segments V and VIII and the intracellular ends of transmembrane segments VI and VII.
TI  - Live probiotics protect intestinal epithelial cells from the effects of infection with enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC).
AB  - BACKGROUND: The colonic epithelium maintains a life long reciprocally beneficial  interaction with the colonic microbiota. Disruption is associated with mucosal injury. AIMS: We hypothesised that probiotics may limit epithelial damage induced by enteroinvasive pathogens, and promote restitution. METHODS: Human intestinal epithelial cell lines (HT29/cl.19A and Caco-2) were exposed to enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC 029:NM), and/or probiotics (Streptococcus thermophilus (ST), ATCC19258, and Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA), ATCC4356). Infected cells and controls were assessed for transepithelial resistance, chloride secretory responses, alterations in cytoskeletal and tight junctional proteins, and responses to epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation. RESULTS: Exposure of cell monolayers to live ST/LA, but not to heat inactivated ST/LA, significantly limited adhesion, invasion, and physiological dysfunction induced by EIEC. Antibiotic killed ST/LA reduced adhesion somewhat but were less effective in limiting the consequences of EIEC invasion of cell monolayers. Furthermore, live ST/LA alone increased transepithelial resistance, contrasting markedly with the fall in resistance evoked by EIEC infection, which could also be blocked by live ST/LA. The effect of ST/LA on resistance was accompanied by maintenance (actin, ZO-1) or enhancement (actinin, occludin) of cytoskeletal and tight junctional protein phosphorylation. ST/LA had no effect on chloride secretion by themselves but reversed the increase in basal secretion evoked by EIEC. EIEC also reduced the ability of EGF to activate its receptor, which was reversed by ST/LA. CONCLUSIONS: Live ST/LA interact with intestinal epithelial cells to protect them from the deleterious effect of EIEC via mechanisms that include, but are not limited to, interference with pathogen adhesion and invasion. Probiotics likely also enhance the barrier function of naive epithelial cells not exposed to any pathogen.
TI  - Evolution of microbial populations during traditional Feta cheese manufacture and ripening.
AB  - In three different dairies (A, B and C) located in Peloponess region (Southern Greece), traditional Feta cheese trials took place February to March using mixtures of sheep's and goat's milk. Only small variations in the evolution of microbial groups were observed during the whole ripening period. The main groups, such as thermophilic cocci, mesophilic lactococci, thermophilic lactobacilli, nonstarter lactic acid bacteria (NSLAB), presumptive Leuconostoc, enterococci and micrococci, reached their highest levels during the first 16 days, and then declined approximately 1-2 log units until the end of ripening. The remaining groups investigated, comprising yeasts, coliforms and Escherichia coli, were highest at day 4. The yeasts remained constant, while coliforms and E. coli decreased sharply and were not detectable after 120 days of ripening. A number of 146 isolates (dairy A) taken from all stages of the manufacturing and ripening process were purified and studied. Lactobacillus plantarum (58/146) and isolates of related species Lactobacillus pentosus and Lactobacillus paraplantarum (16/146) were the most common microorganisms found during cheese ripening. Streptococcus thermophilus (23/146) and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (20/146) were detected in high levels up to 20 days, and then gradually reduced. Enterococcus faecium (29/146) was found in all manufacturing and ripening stages.
TI  - Identification of a phosphofructokinase-encoding gene from Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ1205--a novel link between carbon metabolism and gene regulation?
AB  - In order to isolate genes encoding so-called Two-Component Regulatory Systems from the lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus, a cloning strategy was employed based on suppression of the alkaline phosphatase-negative phenotype displayed by the Escherichia coli strain ANCC22. Several suppressing clones were obtained which were shown to produce alkaline phosphatase activity. Sequence analysis of four of these clones revealed the presence of overlapping DNA inserts representing two ORFs, designated pfkT and pykT, whose deduced protein products exhibit significant similarity to phosphofructokinases and pyruvate kinases, respectively, from a variety of bacteria. A plasmid bearing pfkT was shown to complement a phosphofructokinase-negative mutant of E. coli, showing that this gene indeed specifies phosphofructokinase activity. It was shown that suppression of the alkaline phosphatase-negative phenotype of E. coli ANCC22 due to the presence of pfkT is caused by modulation of the intracellular level of acetyl phosphate.
TI  - Cloning vectors for Streptococcus thermophilus derived from a native plasmid.
AB  - A 3.5-kb native plasmid (pND103) was identified in Streptococcus thermophilus ST2-1. Preliminary sequence analysis indicated that pND103 belongs to group I S. thermophilus plasmids. A region of approximately 2 kb appears to contain three components: a plus origin of replication (ori) typical of plasmids that replicate via rolling circle replication; a gene encoding a replication protein (rep); and a gene encoding a small heat shock protein (hsp). pND103 was then used to construct S. thermophilus/Escherichia coli hybrid cloning vectors by ligating different portions of pND103 to an origin-probe vector (pND330) composed of pUC19 and a Gram-positive erythromycin resistance gene. The shuttle vectors (pND913, pND914 and pND915) were successfully introduced back into plasmid-free S. thermophilus ST3-1 as well as to Lactococcus lactis LM0230 and E. coli JM109. Segregational and structural stability study indicated that these vectors can be maintained in these hosts. The results indicated that pND913, pND914 and pND915 are potential shuttle cloning vectors for S. thermophilus.
TI  - Characterization of the melA locus for alpha-galactosidase in Lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  - Alpha-galactosides are abundant sugars in legumes such as soy. Because of the lack of alpha-galactosidase (alpha-Gal) in the digestive tract, humans are unable to digest these sugars, which consequently induce flatulence. To develop the consumption of the otherwise highly nutritional soy products, the use of exogenous alpha-Gal is promising. In this framework, we characterized the melA gene for alpha-Gal in Lactobacillus plantarum. The melA gene encodes a cytoplasmic 84-kDa protein whose enzymatically active form occurs as oligomers. The melA gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, yielding an active alpha-Gal. We show that melA is transcribed from its own promoter, yielding a monocistronic mRNA, and that it is regulated at the transcriptional level, i.e., it is induced by melibiose but is not totally repressed by glucose. Posttranscriptional regulation by the carbon source could also occur. Upstream of melA, a putative galactoside transporter, designated RafP, was identified that shows high homology to LacS, the unique transporter for both alpha- and beta-galactosides in Streptococcus thermophilus. rafP is also expressed as a monocistronic mRNA. Downstream of melA, the lacL and lacM genes were identified that encode a heterodimeric beta-galactosidase. A putative galM gene identified in the same cluster suggests the presence of a galactose operon. These results indicate that the genes involved in galactoside catabolism are clustered in L. plantarum ATCC 8014. This first genetic characterization of melA and of its putative associated transporter, rafP, in a lactobacillus opens doors to various applications both in the manufacture of soy-derived products and in probiotic and nutraceutical issues.
TI  - Survival of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in traditional African yoghurt fermentation.
AB  - Growth and survival of a nontoxigenic strain of Escherichia coli O157:H7 (ATCC 43888) was determined in traditionally fermented pasteurized milk. Preheated milk was inoculated with 1% (v/v) of a mixed culture of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (NCIMB 11778) and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (NCIMB 110368) and incubated at 25, 30, 37 or 43 degrees C for 24 h. E. coli O157:H7 (10(5) CFU/ml) were introduced into the milk pre- and post-fermentation. Fermented milk samples were subsequently stored at either 4 degrees C (refrigerator temperature) or 25 degrees C (to mimic African ambient temperature) for 5 days. After 24 h of fermentation, the pH of the samples fermented at the higher temperatures of 37-43 degrees C decreased from 6.8 to 4.4-4.0 ( +/- 0.2) whereas at the lower temperature of 25 degrees C, the pH decreased to pH 5.0 +/- 0.1. During this period, viable counts for E. coli O157:H7 increased from 10(5) to 10(8) - 10(9) CFU/ml except in milk fermented at 43 degrees C wherein viability declined to 10(4) CFU/ml. In fermented (25-30 degrees C) milk stored at 4 degrees C for 5 days, E. coli O157:H7 viability decreased from 10(8-9) to 10(6-7) CFU/ml whereas milk fermented at 43 degrees C resulted in loss of detectable cells. In contrast, storage of fermented milk samples at 25 degrees C for 5 days eventually resulted in complete loss of viability irrespective of fermentation temperature. Stationary phase E. coli O157:H7 inoculated post-fermentation (25 and 43 degrees C) survived during 4 degrees C storage, but not 25 degrees C storage. Fermentation temperature and subsequent storage temperature are critical to the growth and survival of E. coli O157:H7 in traditional fermented products involving yoghurt starter cultures.
TI  - A PCR-based method for identification of lactobacilli at the genus level.
AB  - We developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method for the identification of lactobacilli at the genus level. One specific primer, LbLMA1-rev, was designed by analysing similarities between the nucleotide sequence of the spacer between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes in a number of Lactobacillus strains. Amplification with LbLMA1-rev and R16-1, a universal primer, generated a PCR product for 23 Lactobacillus species. Electrophoresis did not reveal any discrete bands when Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Streptococcus thermophilus, Carnobacterium pissicola, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Weissella confusa, Enterococcus hirae, Staphylococcus aureus or Listeria monocytogenes DNA were used as template.
TI  - Combined in-gel tryptic digestion and CNBr cleavage for the generation of peptide maps of an integral membrane protein with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.
AB  - A limitation of the in-gel approaches for the generation of peptides of membrane  proteins is the size and hydrophobicity of the fragments generated. For membrane proteins like the lactose transporter (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus, tryptic digestion or CNBr cleavage yields several hydrophobic fragments larger than 3.5 kDa. As a result, the sequence coverage of the membrane domain is low when the in-gel tryptic-digested or CNBr-cleaved fragments are analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS). The combination of tryptic digestion and subsequent CNBr cleavage on the same gel pieces containing LacS approximately doubled the coverage of the hydrophobic membrane domain compared to the individual cleavage methods, while the coverage of the soluble domain remained complete. The fragments formed are predominantly below m/z 2500, which allows accurate mass measurement.
TI  - Effects of rodA and pbp2b disruption on cell morphology and oxidative stress response of Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ368.
AB  - Insertional mutagenesis was used to isolate clones from Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ368 that were modified in their abilities to tolerate oxidative stress. During this process, two menadione-sensitive clones (6G4 and 18C3) were found to display abnormal cell morphologies and distorted chain topologies and were further studied. Molecular characterization of both 6G4 and 18C3 mutants indicated that they were disrupted in open reading frames homologous to rodA and pbp2b, respectively. Both genes encoded proteins in Escherichia coli that were described as being implicated in peptidoglycan synthesis during the process of cell elongation and to function in determining the rod shape of the cell. This work reports a possible connection between peptidoglycan biosynthesis and oxidative stress defense in S. thermophilus CNRZ368.
TI  - Enteroinvasive bacteria alter barrier and transport properties of human intestinal epithelium: role of iNOS and COX-2.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Various invasive pathogens cause diarrhea, but the mechanism(s) are poorly understood. We hypothesized that nitric oxide and prostaglandins might modulate chloride secretory and barrier properties of the infected intestinal epithelium and that diarrhea is caused, in part, by altered expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2). METHODS: Studies were conducted in human intestinal epithelial cell lines (HT29/cl.19A, Caco-2, and T84). Cells were infected with enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC 029:NM) or Salmonella dublin (SD), or nonpathogenic, noninvasive bacteria (Streptococcus thermophilus [ST] and Lactobacillus acidophilus [LA]). Infected cells and controls were tested for transepithelial resistance, chloride secretion, prostaglandin E2, guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate and adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, and protein expression. RESULTS: Cells infected with EIEC or SD, but not uninfected controls or ST/LA-exposed monolayers, showed a progressive reduction in transepithelial resistance starting at 6-12 hours. Infected HT29/cl.19A and Caco-2 cells, but not T84 cells, also showed an increase in total nitrite. Expression of iNOS, and consequently COX-2, was also increased, followed by increased production of prostaglandins and cyclic nucleotides. Furthermore, basal and stimulated chloride secretory responses to various agonists were enhanced in HT29/cl.19A and Caco-2 cells after infection with enteroinvasive bacteria, and this effect was reversed for some agonists by iNOS or COX-2 inhibitors. Increased expression of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and NKCC1 was also observed in EIEC or SD-infected cells vs. controls, secondary to NO synthase activity. CONCLUSIONS: Up-regulation of iNOS and COX-2 by enteroinvasive bacteria can modulate chloride secretion and barrier function in intestinal epithelial cells. Thus, these enzymes represent possible therapeutic targets in infectious diarrhea.
TI  - Galactose and lactose genes from the galactose-positive bacterium Streptococcus salivarius and the phylogenetically related galactose-negative bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus: organization, sequence, transcription, and activity of the gal gene products.
AB  - Streptococcus salivarius is a lactose- and galactose-positive bacterium that is phylogenetically closely related to Streptococcus thermophilus, a bacterium that metabolizes lactose but not galactose. In this paper, we report a comparative characterization of the S. salivarius and S. thermophilus gal-lac gene clusters. The clusters have the same organization with the order galR (codes for a transcriptional regulator and is transcribed in the opposite direction), galK (galactokinase), galT (galactose-1-P uridylyltransferase), galE (UDP-glucose 4-epimerase), galM (galactose mutarotase), lacS (lactose transporter), and lacZ (beta-galactosidase). An analysis of the nucleotide sequence as well as Northern blotting and primer extension experiments revealed the presence of four promoters located upstream from galR, the gal operon, galM, and the lac operon of S. salivarius. Putative promoters with virtually identical nucleotide sequences were found at the same positions in the S. thermophilus gal-lac gene cluster. An additional putative internal promoter at the 3' end of galT was found in S. thermophilus but not in S. salivarius. The results clearly indicated that the gal-lac gene cluster was efficiently transcribed in both species. The Shine-Dalgarno sequences of galT and galE were identical in both species, whereas the ribosome binding site of S. thermophilus galK differed from that of S. salivarius by two nucleotides, suggesting that the S. thermophilus galK gene might be poorly translated. This was confirmed by measurements of enzyme activities.
TI  - Identification of the DNA-binding protein, HrcA, of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - HrcA is a negative transcriptional factor controlling the expression of the stress-specific operons dnaK and groESL in several bacteria. Although the HrcA structural gene has been identified in various organisms, studies at the protein level have been so far limited and mostly restricted to Bacillus subtilis. We have identified the HrcA protein of Streptococcus thermophilus and show here that it is a dimer with a native molecular mass of 74.5 kDa and a sequence-specific DNA-binding activity. Partially denatured and inactive S. thermophilus HrcA recovered its binding activity in the presence of the GroEL chaperone.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a Streptococcus thermophilus plasmid closely related to the pMV158 family.
AB  - Twenty-two Streptococcus thermophilus strains used for milk fermentations were analyzed for their plasmid content and 13 of them (59%) were found to contain one or two plasmids. Fifteen S. thermophilus plasmids were divided into four groups using DNA homology. Ten plasmids were classified within group A and they shared homologies with all the previously sequenced S. thermophilus plasmids. Three plasmids (group B) hybridized with each other and two plasmids only hybridized with themselves (groups C and D). Single-stranded DNA was detected within strains containing plasmids of groups A, C, and D, indicating that they replicate via a rolling-circle mode. The only plasmid of group C, named pSMQ172, was further characterized. This 4230-bp plasmid replicates in Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius and does not confer phage resistance. Comparisons with databases showed that pSMQ172 was related to pMV158 of Streptococcus agalactiae and to pSSU1 of Streptococcus suis. These results suggest that genetic exchanges may have occurred between pathogenic and nonpathogenic streptococci.
TI  - Requirement for phosphoglucomutase in exopolysaccharide biosynthesis in glucose-  and lactose-utilizing Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - To study the influence of phosphoglucomutase (PGM) activity on exopolysaccharide  (EPS) synthesis in glucose- and lactose-growing Streptococcus thermophilus, a knockout PGM mutant and a strain with elevated PGM activity were constructed. The pgmA gene, encoding PGM in S. thermophilus LY03, was identified and cloned. The gene was functional in Escherichia coli and was shown to be expressed from its own promoter. The pgmA-deficient mutant was unable to grow on glucose, while the mutation did not affect growth on lactose. Overexpression of pgmA had no significant effect on EPS production in glucose-growing cells. Neither deletion nor overexpression of pgmA changed the growth or EPS production on lactose. Thus, the EPS precursors in lactose-utilizing S. thermophilus are most probably formed from the galactose moiety of lactose via the Leloir pathway, which circumvents the need for a functional PGM.
TI  - Formulations and processing of yogurt affect the microbial quality of carbonated  yogurt.
AB  - Carbonation, flavor, culture type, pH, and storage time were varied to investigate the effects of these variables and their interactions on the growth of both typical and nontypical yogurt cultures and some contaminating bacteria. Two types of yogurt cultures (YC-470 and YC-180) were used as the source of typical yogurt bacteria, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. In addition, Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA-K) and Bifidobacterium longum ATCC 15707 were added as nontypical yogurt cultures to make sweetened low fat (1%) Swiss-style plain, strawberry, and lemon yogurts. Samples were incubated at 43 degrees C until pH values of 5.0 or 4.2 were reached. Strawberry yogurts at low (4.2) and high (5.0) pHs were divided into three portions, which were separately inoculated with contaminating bacteria, Bacillus licheniformis ATCC 14580, Escherichia coli ATCC 11775, and Listeria monocytogenes Scott A. After incorporation of carbon dioxide (1.10 to 1.27 volume of CO2 gas dissolved in water), the yogurt was stored at 4 degrees C for a 90-d period. Carbon dioxide did not affect the growth of typical or nontypical yogurt bacteria. Also, CO2 did not inhibit the growth of undesirable microorganisms. In general, low levels of CO2 did not affect the bacterial population in yogurt. The microflora of yogurt were influenced by culture type, pH, flavor type, and storage time or their interactions.
TI  - Efficient preparation of natural and synthetic galactosides with a recombinant beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase-/UDP-4'-gal epimerase fusion protein.
AB  - The numerous biological roles of LacNAc-based oligosaccharides have led to an increased demand for these structures for biological studies. In this report, an efficient route for the synthesis of beta-galactosides using a bacterial beta-4-galactosyltransferase/-UDP-4'-gal-epimerase fusion protein is described. The lgtB gene from Neisseria meningitidis and the galE gene from Streptococcus thermophilus were fused and cloned into an expression vector pCW. The fusion protein transfers galactose to a variety of different glucose- and glucosamine-containing acceptors, and utilizes either UDP-galactose or UDP-glucose as donor substrates. A crude lysate from Escherichia coli expressing the fusion protein is demonstrated to be sufficient for the efficient preparation of galactosylated oligosaccharides from inexpensive UDP-glucose in a multigram scale. Lysates containing the fusion protein are also found to be useful in the production of more complex oligosaccharides in coupled reaction mixtures, e.g., in the preparation of sialosides from N-acetylglucosamine. Thus, bacterially expressed fusion protein is well suited for the facile and economic preparation of natural oligosaccharides and synthetic derivatives based on the lactosamine core.
TI  - Identification, cloning, and expression of a functional phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (pheRS) from Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (pheRS) is unique among aminoacyl tRNA synthetases in that it is a heterotetrameric enzyme composed of two alpha-subunits and two larger beta-subunits. In prokaryotes, the alpha- and beta-subunits of pheRS are encoded by the genes pheS and pheT, respectively. In this report we describe the isolation of a DNA fragment (3.52 kb) containing the pheS and pheT genes from a Staphylococcus aureus (WCUH29) genomic DNA library. Both genes, found as a part of transcriptional operon, were predicted to encode polypeptides which showed strong primary and structural similarity to prokaryotic phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase alpha- and beta- subunits. We describe the high-level overexpression and purification of recombinant S. aureus pheRS using pheS and pheT genes as part of an artificial operon in Escherichia coli. For comparative analysis we also report a procedure for the purification of native pheRS from S. aureus (Oxford Strain) and demonstrate that Michaelis-Menten parameters for both recombinant and native enzyme, at least for phenylalanine tRNA aminoacylation are comparable.
TI  - Analysis of six prophages in Lactococcus lactis IL1403: different genetic structure of temperate and virulent phage populations.
AB  - We report the genetic organisation of six prophages present in the genome of Lactococcus lactis IL1403. The three larger prophages (36-42 kb), belong to the already described P335 group of temperate phages, whereas the three smaller ones (13-15 kb) are most probably satellites relying on helper phage(s) for multiplication. These data give a new insight into the genetic structure of lactococcal phage populations. P335 temperate phages have variable genomes, sharing homology over only 10-33% of their length. In contrast, virulent phages have highly similar genomes sharing homology over >90% of their length. Further analysis of genetic structure in all known groups of phages active on other bacterial hosts such as Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, MYCOBACTERIUM: and Streptococcus thermophilus confirmed the existence of two types of genetic structure related to the phage way of life. This might reflect different intensities of horizontal DNA exchange: low among purely virulent phages and high among temperate phages and their lytic homologues. We suggest that the constraints on genetic exchange among purely virulent phages reflect their optimal genetic organisation, adapted to a more specialised and extreme form of parasitism than temperate/lytic phages.
TI  - Activation of silent gal genes in the lac-gal regulon of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus strain CNRZ 302 is unable to ferment galactose, neither that generated intracellularly by lactose hydrolysis nor the free sugar. Nevertheless, sequence analysis and complementation studies with Escherichia coli demonstrated that strain CNRZ 302 contained structurally intact genes for the Leloir pathway enzymes. These were organized into an operon in the order galKTE, which was preceded by a divergently transcribed regulator gene, galR, and followed by a galM gene and the lactose operon lacSZ. Results of Northern blot analysis showed that the structural gal genes were transcribed weakly, and only in medium containing lactose, by strain CNRZ 302. However, in a spontaneous galactose-fermenting mutant, designated NZ302G, the galKTE genes were well expressed in cells grown on lactose or galactose. In both CNRZ 302 and the Gal(+) mutant NZ302G, the transcription of the galR gene was induced by growth on lactose. Disruption of galR indicated that it functioned as a transcriptional activator of both the gal and lac operons while negatively regulating its own expression. Sequence analysis of the gal promoter regions of NZ302G and nine other independently isolated Gal(+) mutants of CNRZ 302 revealed mutations at three positions in the galK promoter region, which included substitutions at positions -9 and -15 as well as a single-base-pair insertion at position -37 with respect to the main transcription initiation point. Galactokinase activity measurements and analysis of gusA reporter gene fusions in strains containing the mutated promoters suggested that they were gal promoter-up mutations. We propose that poor expression of the gal genes in the galactose-negative S. thermophilus CNRZ 302 is caused by naturally occurring mutations in the galK promoter.
TI  - Characterization of the cryptic plasmid pSBO2 isolated from Streptococcus bovis JB1 and construction of a new shuttle vector.
AB  - A cryptic plasmid designated pSBO2 (3582 bp) was isolated from Streptococcus bovis JB1. The pSBO2 contained putative sites for a double-strand origin (dso), a small transcriptional repressor protein (Cop), countertranscribed RNAs (ctRNAs), and a replication protein (Rep), which were similar to those from pMV158 and pLS1, which were isolated from S. agalactiae, and pWVO1, isolated from Lactococcus lactis. The putative single-strand origin (sso) of pSBO2 was similar to pER341 and pST1, which were isolated from S. thermophilus. Recombinant plasmid designated pSBE2 was constructed to bind pECM184 vector and the DNA fragment containing sso, dso, Cop, ctRNAs, and Rep of pSBO2. When pSBE2 was introduced into S. bovis 12-U-1 and no8, the plasmids in the transformants had deleted the 160-bp fragment between sso and dso. This plasmid, designated pSBE2A, was capable of transforming Escherichia coli and S. bovis strains 12-U-1 and no8 on high frequency; therefore, pSBE2A is an effective shuttle vector.
TI  - Efficient insertional mutagenesis in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Bacteria have always been considered ideal organisms for genetic analysis. While  this is true for some model organisms, like Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and, more recently, Lactococcus lactis, genetic analysis of other organisms is often prevented by lack of valuable tools, like vectors, transposons and methods for transformation, gene inactivation and random insertional mutagenesis. This is the case of the moderately thermophilic bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus, an organism that, in spite of its widespread use for food fermentations, is only poorly characterized. We report here an insertional mutagenesis system that allows efficient random mutagenesis, easy characterization of the interrupted genes and construction of stable null mutations. This may become a powerful S. thermophilus tool for both genetic analysis and construction of 'food-grade' mutants of this biotechnologically relevant microorganism.
TI  - The complete cps gene cluster from Streptococcus thermophilus NCFB 2393 involved  in the biosynthesis of a new exopolysaccharide.
AB  - The cpsFGHIJKL genes from the cps cluster of Streptococcus thermophilus NCFB 2393 involved in the biosynthesis of EPS were identified, cloned and nucleotide sequenced. The complete cps cluster is contained on an approximately 11.2 kb chromosomal region which contains 12 ORFs, including the previously cloned cpsABCDE genes. Functions were assigned to some of the predicted gene products on the basis of homology to known sequences as follows: cpsK encodes a protein thought to be involved in the polymerization and export of the polysaccharide; cpsE, cpsF, cpsG, cpsH, cpsI and cpsJ encode putative sugar transferases. Two insertion sequences, IS1193 and ISS1, were identified within and flanking the 3' end of the cps cluster respectively. Analysis of the expression of the cpsE gene in Escherichia coli demonstrated that it encodes a glucose-1-phosphate transferase; the enzyme which catalyses the first step in EPS biosynthesis in S. thermophilus NCFB 2393.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence, expression and transcriptional analysis of the Bifidobacterium longum MB 219 lacZ gene.
AB  - The gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of Escherichia coli from Bifidobacterium longum MB219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten Bifidobacterium strains tested of the species B. longum, B. breve, B. adolescentis, B. indicum, B. animalis and B. cuniculi. The nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to E. coli revealed the presence of a lacZ-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site. A sequence showing 72% identity with the proline tRNA of Bacillus subtilis and a gene probably encoding the DNA-3-methyladenine glycosydase I were located downstream from the lacZ gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. By primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacZ gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the -10 region of the putative promoter. The nucleotide sequence of lacZ and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes and enzymes from other microorganisms. High similarity was demonstrated between the B. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in Lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, E. coli, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Leuconostoc lactis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the LacZ family. The B. longum MB219 lacZ gene was cloned in Bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. The expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.
TI  - Quaternary structure of the lactose transport protein of Streptococcus thermophilus in the detergent-solubilized and membrane-reconstituted state.
AB  - The quaternary structure of LacS, the lactose transporter of Streptococcus thermophilus, has been determined for the detergent-solubilized and the membrane-reconstituted state of the protein. The quaternary structure of the n-dodecyl-beta-d-maltoside-solubilized state was studied using a combination of sedimentation velocity and equilibrium centrifugation analysis. From these measurements it followed that the detergent-solubilized LacS undergoes reversible self-association with a monomer to dimer mode of association. The association constants were 5.4 +/- 3.6 and 4.4 +/- 1.0 ml mg(-1) as determined from the velocity and equilibrium sedimentation measurements, respectively. The experiments did not indicate significant changes in the shape of the protein-detergent complex or the amount of detergent bound in going from the monomeric to dimeric state of LacS. Importantly, a single Cys mutant of LacS is labeled by 2-(4'-maleimidylanilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid in a substrate-dependent manner, indicating that the detergent-solubilized protein exhibits ligand binding activity. The quaternary structure of membrane-reconstituted LacS was determined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy analysis. Recent developments in the analysis of freeze-fracture images (Eskandari, S. P., Wright, E. M., Freman, M., Starace, D. M., and Zampighi, G. A. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, 11235-11240) allowed us to directly correlate the cross-sectional area of the transmembrane segment to a dimeric state of the functionally membrane-reconstituted LacS protein. The cross-sectional area of the LacS protein was calibrated using the membrane-reconstituted transmembrane domain of the mannitol transporter enzyme II, an intramembrane particle for which the cross-sectional area was obtained from maps of two-dimensional crystals. The consequences of the determined quaternary structure for the transport function and regulation of LacS are discussed.
TI  - Rotational mobility and orientational stability of a transport protein in lipid membranes.
AB  - A single-cysteine mutant of the lactose transport protein LacS(C320A/W399C) from  Streptococcus thermophilus was selectively labeled with a nitroxide spin label, and its mobility in lipid membranes was studied as a function of its concentration in the membrane by saturation-transfer electron spin resonance. Bovine rhodopsin was also selectively spin-labeled and studied to aid the interpretation of the measurements. Observations of spin-labeled proteins in macroscopically aligned bilayers indicated that the spin label tends to orient so as to reflect the transmembrane orientation of the protein. Rotational correlation times of 1-2 micros for purified spin-labeled bovine rhodopsin in lipid membranes led to viscosities of 2.2 poise for bilayers of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (28 degrees C) and 3.0 poise for the specific mixture of lipids used to reconstitute LacS (30 degrees C). The rotational correlation time for LacS did not vary significantly over the range of low concentrations in lipid bilayers, where optimal activity was seen to decrease sharply and was determined to be 9 +/- 1 micros (mean +/- SD) for these samples. This mobility was interpreted as being too low for a monomer but could correspond to a dimer if the protein self-associates into an elongated configuration within the membrane. Rather than changing its oligomeric state, LacS appeared to become less ordered at the concentrations in aligned membranes exceeding 1:100 (w/w) with respect to the lipid.
TI  - HPr(His approximately P)-mediated phosphorylation differently affects counterflow and proton motive force-driven uptake via the lactose transport protein of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The lactose transport protein (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus has a C-terminal hydrophilic domain that is homologous to IIA protein and protein domains of the phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS). The IIA domain of LacS is phosphorylated on His-552 by the general energy coupling proteins of the PTS, which are Enzyme I and HPr. To study the effect of phosphorylation on transport, the LacS protein was purified and incorporated into liposomes with the IIA domain facing outwards. This allowed the phosphorylation of the membrane-reconstituted protein by purified HPr(His approximately P) of S. thermophilus. Phosphorylation of LacS increased the V(max) of counterflow transport, whereas the V(max) of the proton motive force (delta p)-driven lactose uptake was not affected. In line with a range of kinetic studies, we propose that phosphorylation affects the rate constants for the reorientation of the ternary complex (LacS with bound lactose plus proton), which is rate-determining for counterflow but not for delta p-driven transport.
TI  - Phosphorylation state of HPr determines the level of expression and the extent of phosphorylation of the lactose transport protein of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The lactose transport protein (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus is composed of a translocator domain and a regulatory domain that is phosphorylated by HPr(His approximately P), the general energy coupling protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS). Lactose transport is affected by the phosphorylation state of HPr through changes in the activity of the LacS protein as well as expression of the lacS gene. To address whether or not CcpA-HPr(Ser-P)-mediated catabolite control is involved, the levels of LacS were determined under conditions in which the cellular phosphorylation state of HPr greatly differed. It appears that HPr(Ser-P) is mainly present in the exponential phase of growth, whereas HPr(His approximately P) dominates in the stationary phase. The transition from HPr(Ser-P) to HPr(His approximately P) parallels an increase in LacS level, a drop in lactose and an increase in galactose concentration in the growth medium. Because the K(m)(out) for lactose is higher than that for galactose, the lactose transport capacity decreases as lactose concentration decreases and galactose accumulates in the medium. Our data indicate that S. thermophilus compensates for the diminished transport capacity by synthesizing more LacS and phosphorylating the protein, which results in increased transport activity. The link between transport capacity and lacS expression levels and LacS phosphorylation are discussed.
TI  - Close approximation of putative alpha -helices II, IV, VII, X, and XI in the translocation pathway of the lactose transport protein of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The lactose transport protein (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus belongs to a family of transporters in which putative alpha-helices II and IV have been implicated in cation binding and the coupled transport of the substrate and the cation. Here, the analysis of site-directed mutants shows that a positive and negative charge at positions 64 and 71 in helix II are essential for transport, but not for lactose binding. The conservation of charge/side-chain properties is less critical for Glu-67 and Ile-70 in helix II, and Asp-133 and Lys-139 in helix IV, but these residues are important for the coupled transport of lactose together with a proton. The analysis of second-site suppressor mutants indicates an ion pair exists between helices II and IV, and thus a close approximation of these helices can be made. The second-site suppressor analysis also suggests ion pairing between helix II and the intracellular loops 6-7 and 10-11. Because the C-terminal region of the transmembrane domain, especially helix XI and loop 10-11, is important for substrate binding in this family of proteins, we propose that sugar and proton binding and translocation are performed by the joint action of these regions in the protein. Indeed, substrate protection of maleimide labeling of single cysteine mutants confirms that alpha-helices II and IV are directly interacting or at least conformationally involved in sugar binding and/or translocation. On the basis of new and published data, we reason that the helices II, IV, VII, X, and XI and the intracellular loops 6-7 and 10-11 are in close proximity and form the binding sites and/or the translocation pathway in the transporters of the galactosides-pentosides-hexuronides family.
TI  - Enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  - Enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against Ent. faecalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. sake, Listeria innocua, Propionibacterium acidipropionici, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium. One of the four pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. No antimicrobial activity was recorded against Bacillus cereus, Cl. sporogenes, Cl. tyrobutyricum, Leuconostoc cremoris, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus carnosus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to Proteinase K, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. Treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. Half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees C for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a pH of 1.0-5.0 and pH 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. Enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 AU ml-1, but increased further to 1600 AU ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. The peptide is approximately 3.4 kDa in size, as determined after partial purification with Amberlite XAD-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The mechanism of antimicrobial activity against Lact. sake LMG 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
TI  - Enhanced and feedback-resistant gamma-glutamyl kinase activity of an Escherichia  coli transformant carrying a mutated proB gene of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - We used a PCR-based method to generate a single base pair mutation in the proB gene of Streptococcus thermophilus, which replaced an aspartic acid with a glycine residue at position 192 of the first proline biosynthetic enzyme gamma-glutamyl kinase. This was the first identified mutation in amino acid biosynthesis in S. thermophilus to our knowledge. The mutation caused an enhanced, feedback-resistant gamma-glutamyl kinase activity and conferred an analogue-resistant phenotype to an Escherichia coli transformant containing the mutated gene.
TI  - A spectroscopic assay for the analysis of carbohydrate transport reactions.
AB  - A carbohydrate-transport assay was developed that does not require isotopically labelled substrates, but allows transport reactions to be followed spectrophotometrically. It makes use of a membrane system (hybrid membranes or proteoliposomes) bearing the transport system of interest, and a pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent aldose dehydrogenase [soluble glucose dehydrogenase (sGDH)] and the electron acceptor 2,6-dichloroindophenol (Cl2Ind) enclosed in the vesicle lumen. After transport across the vesicular membrane, the sugar is oxidized by sGDH. The accompanying reduction of Cl2Ind results in a decrease in A600. The assay was developed and optimized for the lactose carrier (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus, and both solute/H+ symport and exchange types of transport could be measured with high sensitivity in crude membranes as well as in proteoliposomes. To observe exchange transport, the membranes were preloaded with a nonoxidizable substrate analogue and diluted in assay buffer containing an oxidizable sugar. Transport rates measured with this assay are comparable with those obtained with the conventional assay using isotopically labelled substrates. The method is particularly suited for determining transport reactions that are not coupled to any form of metabolic energy such as uniport reactions, or for characterizing mutant proteins with a defective energy-coupling mechanism or systems with high-affinity constants for sugars.
TI  - Substrate recognition at the cytoplasmic and extracellular binding site of the lactose transport protein of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The lactose transport protein (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus catalyzes the  uptake of lactose in an exchange reaction with intracellularly formed galactose. The interactions between the substrate and the cytoplasmic and extracellular binding site of LacS have been characterized by assaying binding and transport of a range of sugars in proteoliposomes, in which the purified protein was reconstituted with a unidirectional orientation. Specificity for galactoside binding is given by the spatial configuration of the C-2, C-3, C-4, and C-6 hydroxyl groups of the galactose moiety. Except for a C-4 methoxy substitution, replacement of the hydroxyl groups for bulkier groups is not tolerated at these positions. Large hydrophobic or hydrophilic substitutions on the galactose C-1 alpha or beta position did not impair transport. In fact, the hydrophobic groups increased the binding affinity but decreased transport rates compared with galactose. Binding and transport characteristics of deoxygalactosides from either side of the membrane showed that the cytoplasmic and extracellular binding site interact differently with galactose. Compared with galactose, the IC(50) values for 2-deoxy- and 6-deoxygalactose at the cytoplasmic binding site were increased 150- and 20-fold, respectively, whereas they were the same at the extracellular binding site. From these and other experiments, we conclude that the binding sites and translocation pathway of LacS are spacious along the C-1 to C-4 axis of the galactose moiety and are restricted along the C-2 to C-6 axis. The differences in affinity at the cytoplasmic and extracellular binding site ensure that the transport via LacS is highly asymmetrical for the two opposing directions of translocation.
TI  - Promoter activity of the pER341-borne ST(Phsp) in heterologous gene expression in Escherichia coli and Streptococcus thermophilus(1).
AB  - A 138-bp EcoO109/HinfI fragment of Streptococcus thermophilus plasmid pER341 (2798 bp) including the promoter sequence of the heat stress protein gene hsp16.4 was tested in vector constructs for ability to activate the promoterless green fluorescent protein gene (gfp) from a jelly fish in Escherichia coli, S. thermophilus, and lactococci. ST(Phsp) promoted gfp expression in transformed hosts as evidenced by the presence of green fluorescent (GFP(+)) colonies under UV illumination. The results confirmed the potential of ST(Phsp) as a functional promoter in heterologous gene expression in dairy fermentation bacteria.
TI  - Functional analysis of glycosyltransferase genes from Lactococcus lactis and other gram-positive cocci: complementation, expression, and diversity.
AB  - Sixteen exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing Lactococcus lactis strains were analyzed for the chemical compositions of their EPSs and the locations, sequences, and organization of the eps genes involved in EPS biosynthesis. This allowed the grouping of these strains into three major groups, representatives of which were studied in detail. Previously, we have characterized the eps gene cluster of strain NIZO B40 (group I) and determined the function of three of its glycosyltransferase (GTF) genes. Fragments of the eps gene clusters of strains NIZO B35 (group II) and NIZO B891 (group III) were cloned, and these encoded the NIZO B35 priming galactosyltransferase, the NIZO B891 priming glucosyltransferase, and the NIZO B891 galactosyltransferase involved in the second step of repeating-unit synthesis. The NIZO B40 priming glucosyltransferase gene epsD was replaced with an erythromycin resistance gene, and this resulted in loss of EPS production. This epsD deletion was complemented with priming GTF genes from gram-positive organisms with known function and substrate specificity. Although no EPS production was found with priming galactosyltransferase genes from L. lactis or Streptococcus thermophilus, complementation with priming glucosyltransferase genes involved in L. lactis EPS and Streptococcus pneumoniae capsule biosynthesis could completely restore or even increase EPS production in L. lactis.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the pediocin operon in Streptococcus thermophilus and other lactic fermentation bacteria.
AB  - Production of pediocin in Pediococcus acidilactici is associated with pMBR1.0, which encodes prepediocin, a pediocin immunity protein, and two proteins involved in secretion and precursor processing. These four genes are organized as an operon under control of a single promoter. We have constructed shuttle vectors that contain all four structural genes, the chromosomal promoter ST(P2201) from Streptococcus thermophilus, and repA from the 2-kbp S. thermophilus plasmid pER8. The recombinant plasmid, pPC318, expressed and secreted active pediocin in Escherichia coli. Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, and Enterococcus faecalis were electrotransformed with pPC418, a modified vector fitted with an erythromycin resistance tracking gene. Pediocin was produced and secreted in each of the lactic acid bacteria, and production was stable for up to ten passages. The expression of pediocin in dairy fermentation microbes has important implications for bacteriocins as food preservatives in dairy products.
TI  - Structural information on a membrane transport protein from nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy using sequence-selective nitroxide labeling.
AB  - The lactose transport protein (LacS) from Streptococcus thermophilus bearing a single cysteine mutation, K373C, within the putative interhelix loop 10-11 has been overexpressed in native membranes. Cross-polarization magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) could selectively distinguish binding of (13)C-labeled substrate to just 50-60 nmol of LacS(K373C) in the native fluid membranes. Nitroxide electron spin-label at the K373C location was essentially immobile on the time scale of both conventional electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR) (<10(-8)s) and saturation-transfer ESR (<10(-3)s), under the same conditions as used in the NMR studies. The presence of the nitroxide spin-label effectively obscured the high-resolution NMR signal from bound substrate, even though (13)C-labeled substrate was shown to be within the binding center of the protein. The interhelix loop 10-11 is concluded to be in reasonably close proximity to the substrate binding site(s) of LacS (<15 A), and the loop region is expected to penetrate between the transmembrane segments of the protein that are involved in the translocation process.
TI  - Comparative sequence analysis of the DNA packaging, head, and tail morphogenesis  modules in the temperate cos-site Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage Sfi21.
AB  - The temperate Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage Sfi21 possesses 15-nucleotide-long cohesive ends with a 3' overhang that reconstitutes a cos-site with twofold hyphenated rotational symmetry. Over the DNA packaging, head and tail morphogenesis modules, the Sfi21 sequence predicts a gene map that is strikingly similar to that of lambdoid coliphages in the absence of any sequence similarity. A nearly one to one gene correlation was found with the phage lambda genes Nu1 to H, except for gene B-to-E complex, where the Sfi21 map resembled that of coliphage HK97. The similarity between Sfi21 and HK97 was striking: both major head proteins showed an N-terminal coiled-coil structure, the mature major head proteins started at amino acid positions 105 and 104, respectively, and both major head genes were preceded by genes encoding a possible protease and portal protein. The purported Sfi21 protease is the first viral member of the ClpP protease family. The prediction of Sfi21 gene functions by reference to the gene map of intensively investigated coliphages was experimentally confirmed for the major head and tail gene. Phage Sfi21 shows nucleotide sequence similarity with Lactococcus phage BK5-T and a lactococcal prophage and amino acid sequence similarity with the Lactobacillus phage A2 and the Staphylococcus phage PVL. PVL is a missing link that connects the portal proteins from Sfi21 and HK97 with respect to sequence similarity. These observations and database searches, which demonstrate sequence similarity between proteins of phage from gram-positive bacteria, proteobacteria, and Archaea, constrain models of phage evolution.
TI  - Purification, characterization, gene cloning, sequencing, and overexpression of aminopeptidase N from Streptococcus thermophilus A.
AB  - The general aminopeptidase PepN from Streptococcus thermophilus A was purified to protein homogeneity by hydroxyapatite, anion-exchange, and gel filtration chromatographies. The PepN enzyme was estimated to be a monomer of 95 kDa, with maximal activity on N-Lys-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin at pH 7 and 37 degrees C. It was strongly inhibited by metal chelating agents, suggesting that it is a metallopeptidase. The activity was greatly restored by the bivalent cations Co2+, Zn2+, and Mn2+. Except for proline, glycine, and acidic amino acid residues, PepN has a broad specificity on the N-terminal amino acid of small peptides, but no significant endopeptidase activity has been detected. The N-terminal and short internal amino acid sequences of purified PepN were determined. By using synthetic primers and a battery of PCR techniques, the pepN gene was amplified, subcloned, and further sequenced, revealing an open reading frame of 2,541 nucleotides encoding a protein of 847 amino acids with a molecular weight of 96,252. Amino acid sequence analysis of the pepN gene translation product shows high homology with other PepN enzymes from lactic acid bacteria and exhibits the signature sequence of the zinc metallopeptidase family. The pepN gene was cloned in a T7 promoter-based expression plasmid and the 452-fold overproduced PepN enzyme was purified to homogeneity from the periplasmic extract of the host Escherichia coli strain. The overproduced enzyme showed the same catalytic characteristics as the wild-type enzyme.
TI  - Modulation of nonspecific mechanisms of defense by lactic acid bacteria: effective dose.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a fermented milk product containing Lactobacillus johnsonii La1 (formerly known as Lactobacillus acidophilus La1) on the phagocytic activity of peripheral blood leukocytes in healthy adult volunteers. Furthermore, we sought to define the effective doses of the bacteria, examine the effect on respiratory burst activity, and, finally, examine the contribution made by the starter culture to the biological effects. Volunteers were randomly distributed among three groups; each subject received one pot (150 ml) of fermented milk each day for 3 wk. The first two groups received a freshly prepared product fermented by Streptococcus thermophilus (group A) alone or S. thermophilus and 10(7) cfu/ml L. johnsonii La1 (group B). Group C received a product stored for a period of 21 to 28 d and that contained S. thermophilus and 10(6) cfu/ml of L. johnsonii La1. Ingestion of L. johnsonii La1 did not significantly increase fecal lactobacilli counts. However, L. johnsonii La1 was able to survive intestinal transit and was only recovered from the feces of the volunteers of groups B and C. The fermented base alone showed a weak effect on respiratory burst but not on phagocytic activity. However, the product containing 10(7) cfu/ml L. johnsonii La1 significantly enhanced both functions. The product containing 10(6) cfu/ml of L. johnsonii La1 had no significant effect on either function. These results suggest that fecal persistence may not necessarily reflect in vivo colonization and may not be a prerequisite for all forms of immune reactivity.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a lysis module present in a large proportion of bacteriophages infecting Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - A lysis module encoded by the temperate bacteriophage phiO1205 was identified. This lysis module contains a lysin gene, designated lyt51, and two putative holin-encoding genes, designated lyt49 and lyt50. lyt51 encodes a lytic enzyme specifically directed against streptococcal cell walls. Similar to other phage-encoded lysins, Lyt51 appears to have a modular design in which the N-terminal portion corresponds to its enzymatic activity while the C-terminal region is responsible for its substrate binding specificity. The two putative holin-encoding genes, lyt49 and lyt50, located immediately upstream of lyt51, were identified on the basis of their homology to other identified holin-encoding genes. Expression of lyt49 or lyt50 in Escherichia coli was shown to cause cell death and leakage of the intracellular enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase into the growth medium without apparent lysis of the cells. Southern blotting experiments demonstrated that at least one of the three components of the identified lysis module is present in all members of a large collection of bacteriophages, indicating that components of this lysis module are widespread among bacteriophages infecting Streptococcus thermophilus.
TI  - Phosphorylation and functional properties of the IIA domain of the lactose transport protein of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The lactose-H+ symport protein (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus has a carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain (IIALacS) that is homologous to a family of proteins and protein domains of the phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) in various organisms, of which IIAGlc of Escherichia coli is the best-characterized member. On the basis of these similarities, it was anticipated that IIALacS would be able to perform one or more functions associated with IIAGlc, i.e., carry out phosphoryl transfer and/or affect other catabolic functions. The gene fragment encoding IIALacS was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the protein was purified in two steps by metal affinity and anion-exchange chromatography. IIALacS was unable to restore glucose uptake in a IIAGlc-deficient strain, which is consistent with a very low rate of phosphorylation of IIALacS by phosphorylated HPr (HPr approximately P) from E. coli. With HPr approximately P from S. thermophilus, the rate was more than 10-fold higher, but the rate constants for the phosphorylation of IIALacS (k1 = 4.3 x 10(2) M-1 s-1) and dephosphorylation of IIALacS approximately P by HPr (k-1 = 1.1 x 10(3) M-1 s-1) are still at least 4 orders of magnitude lower than for the phosphoryltransfer between IIAGlc and HPr from E. coli. This finding suggests that IIALacS has evolved into a protein domain whose main function is not to transfer phosphoryl groups rapidly. On the basis of sequence alignment of IIA proteins with and without putative phosphoryl transfer functions and the known structure of IIAGlc, we constructed a double mutant [IIALacS(I548E/G556D)] that was predicted to have increased phosphoryl transfer activity. Indeed, the phosphorylation rate of IIALacS(I548E/G556D) by HPr approximately P increased (k1 = 4.0 x 10(3) M-1 s-1) and became nearly independent of the source of HPr approximately P (S. thermophilus, Bacillus subtilis, or E. coli). The increased phosphoryl transfer rate of IIALacS(I548E/G556D) was insufficient to complement IIAGlc in PTS-mediated glucose transport in E. coli. Both IIALacS and IIALacS(I548E/G556D) could replace IIAGlc, but in another function: they inhibited glycerol kinase (inducer exclusion) when present in the unphosphorylated form.
TI  - Persistence of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in dairy fermentation systems.
AB  - We examined (i) the persistence of Escherichia coli O157:H7 as a postpasteurization contaminant in fermented dairy products; (ii) the ability of E. coli O157:H7 strains with and without the general stress regulatory protein, RpoS, to compete with commercial starter cultures in fermentation systems; and (iii) the survival of E. coli O157:H7 in the yogurt production process. In commercial products inoculated with 10(3) CFU/ml, E. coli O157:H7 was recovered for up to 12 days in yogurt (pH 4.0), 28 days in sour cream (pH 4.3), and at levels > 10(2) CFU/ml at 35 days in buttermilk (pH 4.1). For the starter culture competition trials, the relative inhibition of E. coli O157:H7 in the experimental fermentation systems was, in decreasing order, thermophilic culture mixture, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus R110 alone, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis D280 alone, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris D62 alone, and Streptococcus thermophilus C90 alone showing the least inhibition. Recovery of the rpoS mutant was lower than recovery of its wild-type parent by 72 h or earlier in the presence of individual starter cultures. No E. coli O157:H7 were recovered after the curd formation step in yogurt manufactured with milk inoculated with 10(5) CFU/ml. Our results show that (i) postprocessing entry of E. coli O157:H7 into fermented dairy products represents a potential health hazard; (ii) commercial starter cultures differ in their ability to reduce E. coli O157:H7 CFU numbers in fermentation systems; and (iii) the RpoS protein appears to most effectively contribute to bacterial survival in the presence of conditions that are moderately lethal to the cell.
TI  - Detergent-mediated reconstitution of membrane proteins.
AB  - The efficiency of reconstitution of the lactose transport protein (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus is markedly higher with Triton X-100 than with other detergents commonly employed to mediate the membrane insertion. To rationalize these differences, the lipid/detergent structures that are formed in the reconstitution process were studied by cryotransmission electron microscopy. Surprisingly, the two nonionic detergents Triton X-100 and n-dodecyl beta-D-maltoside (DDM) affected the liposome structures in a completely different manner. Preformed liposomes titrated with Triton X-100 maintained their bilayer structure far beyond the onset of solubilization, and transport activity was maximal when LacS was inserted into these structures. With DDM the vesicular structures were already disrupted at the onset of solubilization and these membrane sheets were converted into long threadlike micelles at higher DDM to lipid ratios. Triton X-100 allowed the protein to be reconstituted with the hydrophilic surface exposed to the outside, whereas LacS was incorporated randomly when DDM was used. These differences in orientation are readily explained by the different lipid-detergent structures formed by Triton X-100 and DDM. The orientation of the reconstituted LacS protein is a critical factor for the activity of the protein as the kinetics of translocation is very different for opposite directions of transport.
TI  - Conservation of the major cold shock protein in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Primers designed from consensus regions of the major cold shock gene of different bacterial species were used in PCR amplification of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB). An appropriately-sized PCR product was obtained from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis LL43-1 and MG1363; Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris LC10-1, LC11-1, and LC12-1; Streptococcus thermophilus ST1-1; Enterococcus faecalis EF1-1; Lactobacillus acidophilus LA1-1; Lactobacillus helveticus LH1-1; Pediococcus pentosaceus PP1-1; and Bifidobacterium animalis BA1-1. The PCR products were cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequences displayed high sequence similarity with the major cold shock proteins of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis and the human Y-box factor. The amino acid residues of the cold shock domain implicated in nucleic acid binding in several unrelated species were also highly conserved in the LAB strains. It is possible, therefore, that this protein in LAB may also act as a transcriptional enhancer to other cold shock genes and/or act as an RNA chaperone unwinding tightly folded RNA molecules.
TI  - Characterization of a bacteriocin produced by Streptococcus thermophilus 81.
AB  - A new bacteriocin, produced by Streptococcus thermophilus 81 has been isolated, purified and characterized. By its heat sensitivity and broad inhibitory spectrum it does not resemble any other S. thermophilus bacteriocin. The mode of action is bacteriostatic. This peptide of 32 amino acids is efficient against several Bacillus species, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Yersinia enterocolitica. This bacteriocin is heat labile but its activity was not altered by pH variation from 3 to 10. Six months of storage at 40 degrees C did not influence the activity. The inactivation by detergents and the inability to resolve the protein in SDS-PAGE supposes a more complex structure or a possible stabilizing effect of other molecules. The low sensitivity of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus to the isolated bacteriocin suggests that S. thermophilus 81 may be used in yoghurt starters.
TI  - Effect of fermented milk intake on plasmid transfer and on the persistence of transconjugants in the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - Plasmid transfer occurs in the digestive tract and the transconjugants may become durably established. The aim of the present work is to investigate the effect of probiotics of plasmid transfer and on establishment of transconjugants in the gut. Plasmid transfers were carried out in the digestive tract of germ free mice associated with an E. coli K12 donor strain harboring three plasmids (R388, self-transmissible, pCE325 and pUB2380, mobilisable,) and an E. coli recipient strain, PG1, of human origin (Duval-Iflah et al., 1994). Milks fermented with either Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus or symbiosis, S85, of both strains were given daily as 1/3 of food diet. Fermented milks have no effect on the transfer of R388 and pUB2380 except a slight increase of TC(R388) with milk fermented with S85. Long term ingestion of milk fermented with S85 inhibited the formation and the establishment of transconjugants TC(pCE325). Milk fermented with L. bulgaricus lowered the population density of TC(pCE325) in animals where they were already established. This phenomenon was reversible, since the density of TC(pCE325) increased in the same animals after cessation of supplementation. Bacterial cultures obtained in MRS broth and given in state of drinking water were compared with fermented milks. Bacterial cultures with L. bulgaricus and with S85 favoured the establishment of TC(pCE325). There results indicate for the first time that probiotics have various effects on the formation and/or establishment of transconjugants in the gut of axenic mice. The effects depend on whether the probiotics were cultivated in milk or in MRS, indicating that bacterial metabolites and viable bacteria can be involved.
TI  - Molecular characterization of a phage-inducible middle promoter and its transcriptional activator from the lactococcal bacteriophage phi31.
AB  - An inducible middle promoter from the lactococcal bacteriophage phi31 was isolated previously by shotgun cloning an 888-bp fragment (P15A10) upstream of the beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal) gene (lacZ.st) from Streptococcus thermophilus (D. J. O'Sullivan, S. A. Walker, S. G. West, and T. R. Klaenhammer, Bio/Technology 14:82-87, 1996). The promoter showed low levels of constitutive beta-Gal activity which could be induced two- to threefold over baseline levels after phage infection. During this study, the fragment was subcloned and characterized to identify a smaller, tightly regulated promoter fragment which allowed no beta-Gal activity until after phage infection. This fragment, defined within nucleotides 566 to 888 (P(566-888); also called fragment 566-888), contained tandem, phage-inducible transcription start sites at nucleotides 703 and 744 (703/744 start sites). Consensus -10 regions were present upstream of both start sites, but no consensus -35 regions were identified for either start site. A transcriptional activator, encoded by an open reading frame (ORF2) upstream of the 703/744 start sites, was identified for P(566-888). ORF2 activated P(566-888) when provided in trans in Escherichia coli. In addition, when combined with pTRK391 (P15A10::lacZ.st) in Lactococcus lactis NCK203, an antisense ORF2 construct was able to retard induction of the phage-inducible promoter as measured by beta-Gal activity levels. Finally, gel shift assays showed that ORF2 was able to bind to promoter fragment 566-888. Deletion analysis of the region upstream from the tandem promoters identified a possible binding site for transcriptional activation of the phage promoters. The DNA-binding ability of ORF2 was eliminated upon deletion of part of this region, which lies centered approximately 35 bp upstream of start site 703. Deletion analysis and mutagenesis studies also elucidated a critical region downstream of the 703/744 start sites, where mutagenesis resulted in a two- to threefold increase in beta-Gal activity. With these improvements, the level of expression achieved by an explosive-expression strategy was elevated from 3,000 to 11,000 beta-Gal units within 120 min after induction.
TI  - Manufacture and quality of iron-fortified yogurt.
AB  - Yogurts (nonfat and low fat) were manufactured and fortified with 10, 20, and 40  mg of iron/kg of yogurt. Growth of starter culture bacteria and nonstarter culture bacteria as well as lipid oxidation of the yogurts were monitored over 30 d of storage at 4 degrees C. Sensory characteristics of the yogurts were determined during that time by a trained panel of judges, and consumer panels were used to test acceptability of iron-fortified yogurt. Counts of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricas and Streptococcus thermophilus after 1 d of storage in iron-fortified skim yogurts were 7.0 x 10(8) cfu/ml, which were not significantly different from numbers in unfortified yogurts. Counts decreased to 2.5 x 10(8) and 1.9 x 10(8) cfu/ml for L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus, respectively, after 30 d of storage. Fortifying yogurt with iron did not support the growth of Pseudomonas fluorescens or Escherichia coli. No significant increases in chemical oxidation, as measured using the thiobarbituric acid assay, were detected as a consequence of iron fortification. Trained panelists scored all yogurts for oxidized, metallic, bitter, and other off-flavors in the range of "not perceptible" to "very slightly perceptible". Iron-fortified yogurts had slightly higher oxidized flavor scores than did the control yogurt. There was no increase in metallic, bitter, or other off-flavors. The consumer panel did not detect any significant differences in the appearance, mouthfeel, flavor, or overall quality between fortified and unfortified flavored yogurts. All yogurt samples were liked by the consumer panelists, suggesting that yogurt is a suitable vehicle for iron fortification.
TI  - Sth132I, a novel class-IIS restriction endonuclease of Streptococcus thermophilus ST132.
AB  - The Sth132I restriction endonuclease (R.Sth132I) was detected in Streptococcus thermophilus ST132 and purified to near homogeneity by heparin Sepharose CL-6B affinity chromatography. Fragments from Sth132I digestion of plasmid DNA were subcloned into pUC19 in Escherichia coli DH5alpha and sequenced. Sequence analysis of inserts and their ligation junction sites revealed that Sth132I is a novel class-IIS restriction endonuclease, which recognizes the non-palindromic sequence 5'-CCCG(N)4-3', 3'-GGGC(N) 8-5'.
TI  - Identification of a cold shock gene in lactic acid bacteria and the effect of cold shock on cryotolerance.
AB  - When Lactic Acid Bacterial cultures were frozen at -20 degrees C for 24 h, the cell viability decreased drastically, but when they were cold shocked at 10 degrees C for 2 h prior to freezing, viability improved significantly for the Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis strains (25-37%) and Pediococcus pentosaceus PO2 (18%), but not for the Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris strains tested or for one strain of Lactobacillus helveticus LB1 and Streptococcus thermophilus TS2. When the period for cold shock was extended to 5 h, the viability increased even further for those strains that displayed cold shock cryotolerance. Use of degenerate PCR primers based on the major cold shock protein (csp) of both Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis resulted in PCR products from all strains tested. The PCR product from Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis M474 was cloned and sequenced, and the deduced amino acid sequence displayed a high sequence similarity to other csp's. Use of PCR primers based on the M474 sequence resulted in PCR products being produced only from the lactococcal strains studied and not from the Lactobacillus helveticus, Streptococcus thermophilus, or Pediococcus pentosaceus strains tested.
TI  - Cloning, sequence, and expression of the L-(+) lactate dehydrogenase of Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - The ldh gene encoding the fructose-1,6-diphosphate-dependent L-(+) lactate dehydrogenase from the ruminal bacterium Streptococcus bovis was cloned and sequenced. A genomic library of S. bovis JB1 DNA was constructed in lambda ZAP II and screened by use of a heterologous probe derived from the cloned Streptococcus mutans ldh gene. Several clones were isolated that contained a common 2.9-kb fragment as determined by restriction analysis. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a 987-bp open reading frame with extensive homology to Streptococcus thermophilus and S. mutans ldh nucleic acid and amino acid sequences. Expression of the cloned S. bovis ldh gene in Escherichia coli was confirmed by the ability to complement the ldh mutation of E. coli FMJ39, by using an in-gel activity screen and by enzymatic assay. Increased LDH activity was observed in S. bovis JB1 containing the cloned ldh genes on a multicopy plasmid.
TI  - Survival of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in yoghurt during preparation and storage at 4 degrees C.
AB  - Cow's milk was inoculated with ca 10(3) and 10(7) cfu ml-1 Escherichia coli O157:H7. After fermentation at 42 degrees C for 0-5 h, the yoghurt was stored at 4 degrees C. Two kinds of yoghurt were used: traditional yoghurt (TY), made with Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus starter cultures, and 'bifido' yoghurt (BY), made with the two starter cultures plus Bifidobacterium bifidum. After 7 d E. coli O157:H7 decreased from 3.52 to 2.72 log10 cfu ml-1 and from 7.08 to 5.32 log10 cfu ml-1 in TY, and from 3.49 to 2.73 log10 cfu ml-1 and from 7.38 to 5.41 log10 cfu ml-1 in BY. The pH values of yoghurt dropped from 6.6 to 4.5 and 4.4 in TY (for low and high pathogen inocula, respectively), and from 6.6 to 4.6 and 4.5 in BY (for low and high pathogen inocula, respectively).
TI  - Cell wall anchoring of the Streptococcus pyogenes M6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The M6 protein from Streptococcus pyogenes is the best-characterized member of a  family of cell envelope-associated proteins. Based on the observation that the C-terminal sorting signals of these proteins can drive cell wall anchoring of heterologous unanchored proteins, we have cloned and expressed the emm6 structural gene for the M6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The emm6 gene was successfully expressed from lactococcal promoters in several Lactococcus lactis strains, an animal-colonizing Lactobacillus fermentum strain, Lactobacillus sake, and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. The M6 protein was efficiently anchored to the cell wall in all strains tested. In lactobacilli, essentially all detectable M6 protein was cell wall associated. These results suggest the feasibility of using the C-terminal anchor moiety of M6 for protein surface display in LAB.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of transcription signal sequences from Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus (ST) chromosomal DNA fragments generated by partial Sau3A digestion were cloned into the unique BamHI site upstream from the promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene of the Escherichia coli (EC)promoter-probe vector pKK520-3. Recombinant plasmids containing ST sequences with transcription-activation activity were isolated from chloramphenicol-resistant (CmR) EC transformants. A promoterless Streptomyces antibioticus melanin biosynthesis operon (melC) was inserted immediately downstream from the ST sequence to identify DNA with strong promoter activity. Several ST transcription-activation sequences, termed STPs, were isolated and subcloned, and their nucleic acid sequences determined. The -10 and -35 consensus sequences were identified in these putative ST promoters. Detailed analysis of STP3306 sequence data revealed two partial open reading frames (ORFs) with high degrees of homology to prokaryotic GTP-binding protein and DNA repair enzyme, thus providing valuable information for further study on DNA maintenance in this important lactic acid bacterium.
TI  - Proline biosynthesis in Streptococcus thermophilus: characterization of the proBA operon and its products.
AB  - The presence of proline in the medium was not essential for growth of Streptococcus thermophilus, indicating that there is a proline biosynthetic pathway in this organism. Genetic and biochemical analysis identified and characterized this pathway. Two genes, designated proB and proA, were cloned, sequenced and characterized. Biochemical analysis of the proB- and proA-encoded enzymes showed that the proline biosynthetic pathway of S. thermophilus is similar to the one previously described in Escherichia coli. The deduced amino acid sequence of a 2-408 kb DNA region containing the genes revealed the similarity of the S. thermophilus gene products to ProB and ProA of E. coli and Serratia marcescens, and to the corresponding N- and C-terminal domains of the bifunctional plant enzyme delta 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase of Vigna aconitifolia. Northern blot analysis showed that the two genes in S. thermophilus are organized in a single operon with proB proximal and proA distal to the promoter; primer extension analysis indicated that proBA transcription is not under repressive control by exogenously supplied proline.
TI  - Disruption of the gene encoding penicillin-binding protein 2b (pbp2b) causes altered cell morphology and cease in exopolysaccharide production in Streptococcus thermophilus Sfi6.
AB  - Genetic and biochemical analysis of exopolysaccharide (EPS) production in lactic  acid bacteria has been a growing field of interest in the food industry. We previously identified and characterized a gene cluster composed of 13 genes (epsA to epsM) responsible for EPS production in Streptococcus thermophilus Sfi6. Here we report one further gene, pbp2b, that is connected to EPS production. Mutants with a gene disruption in pbp2b were no longer able to produce EPS, exhibited a reduced growth-rate, and their cell morphology was altered. The predicted gene product showed significant homology to the class B penicillin-binding proteins 2b of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mitis involved in peptidoglycan synthesis. Upstream of pbp2b, we further identified two genes which showed significant homology to the E. coli folD and urfl, which is an unidentified open reading frame presumed to be involved in DNA repair. Downstream of pbp2b, we identified a gene that showed homology to the Bacillus subtilis and the Escherichia coli recM or recR which, respectively, are involved in the methyl-dependent DNA mismatch repair. In S. thermophilus, pbp2b and recM were transcribed from their own promoters as monocistronic mRNAs and are therefore organized as independent transcriptional units.
TI  - Genomic organization of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Current knowledge of the genomes of the lactic acid bacteria, Lactococcus lactis  and Streptococcus thermophilus, and members of the genera Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus and Carnobacterium, is reviewed. The genomes contain a chromosome within the size range of 1.8 to 3.4 Mbp. Plasmids are common in Lactococcus lactis (most strains carry 4-7 different plasmids), some of the lactobacilli and pediococci, but they are not frequently present in S. thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus or the intestinal lactobacilli. Five IS elements have been found in L. lactis and most strains carry multiple copies of at least two of them; some strains also carry a 68-kbp conjugative transposon. IS elements have been found in the genera Lactobacillus and Leuconostoc, but not in S. thermophilus. Prophages are also a normal component of the L. lactis genome and lysogeny is common in the lactobacilli, however it appears to be rare in S. thermophilus. Physical and genetic maps for two L. lactis subsp. lactis strains, two L. lactis subsp. cremoris strains and S. thermophilus A054 have been constructed and each reveals the presence of six rrn operons clustered in less than 40% of the chromosome. The L. lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363 map contains 115 genetic loci and the S. thermophilus map has 35. The maps indicate significant plasticity in the L. lactis subsp. cremoris chromosome in the form of a number of inversions and translocations. The cause(s) of these rearrangements is (are) not known. A number of potentially powerful genetic tools designed to analyse the L. lactis genome have been constructed in recent years. These tools enable gene inactivation, gene replacement and gene recovery experiments to be readily carried out with this organism, and potentially with other lactic acid bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria. Integration vectors based on temperate phage attB sites and the random insertion of IS elements have also been developed for L. lactis and the intestinal lactobacilli. In addition, a L. lactis sex factor that mobilizes the chromosome in a manner reminiscent to that seen with Escherichia coli Hfr strains has been discovered and characterized. With the availability of this new technology, research into the genome of the lactic acid bacteria is poised to undertake a period of extremely rapid information accrual.
TI  - Gene for aspartate racemase from the sulfur-dependent hyperthermophilic archaeum, Desulfurococcus strain SY.
AB  - Amino acid racemases are ubiquitous throughout eubacteria. However, no amino acid racemases have yet been found in eukaryotes and archaea. We cloned a gene highly homologous to that for the aspartate racemase from the sulfur-dependent hyperthermophilic archaeum, Desulfurococcus strain SY. The product of the gene showed 35.2% amino acid sequence identity with the aspartate racemase of Streptococcus thermophilus IAM10064, and was also homologous to glutamate racemases around the putative catalytic cysteine residues. The encoded protein was expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein had amino acid racemizing activity, which was highly specific for aspartate and increased with temperature from 37 degrees C to 90 degrees C. Therefore, this was identified as the first hyperthermophilic archaeal amino acid racemase. A little aspartate racemizing activity was also detected in the crude extract of Desulfurococcus strain SY. The function of this aspartate racemase might be the uptake of -aspartate formed at high temperature or the production of -aspartate as a cell component. The fact that the amino acid racemases are distributed among both eubacteria and archaea suggests that endogenous -amino acids in mammals are also synthesized by amino acid racemases.
TI  - Unidirectional reconstitution into detergent-destabilized liposomes of the purified lactose transport system of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The lactose transport protein (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus was amplified  to levels as high as 8 and 30% of total membrane protein in Escherichia coli and S. thermophilus, respectively. In both organisms the protein was functional and the expression levels were highest with the streptococcal lacS promoter. Also a LacS deletion mutant, lacking the carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain, could be amplified to levels >20% of membrane protein. Membranes from S. thermophilus proved to be superior in terms of efficient solubilization and ease and extent of purification of LacS; >95% of LacS was solubilized with relatively low concentrations of Triton X-100, n-octyl-beta-D-glucoside, n-dodecyl-beta-D-maltoside, or C12E8. The LacS protein carrying a poly-histidine tag was purified in large quantities (approximately 5 mg/liter of culture) and with a purity >98% in a two-step process involving nickel chelate affinity and anion exchange chromatography. The membrane reconstitution of LacS was studied systematically by stepwise solubilization of preformed liposomes, prepared from E. coli phospholipid and phosphatidylcholine, and protein incorporation at the different stages of liposome solubilization. The detergents were removed by adsorption onto polystyrene beads and H+-lactose symport and lactose counterflow were measured. Highest transport activities were obtained when Triton X-100 was used throughout the solubilization/purification procedure, whereas activity was lost irreversibly with n-octyl-beta-D-glucoside. For reconstitutions mediated by n-dodecyl-beta-D-maltoside, C12E8, and to a lesser extent Triton X-100, the highest transport activities were obtained when the liposomes were titrated with low amounts of detergent (onset of liposome solubilization). Importantly, under these conditions proteoliposomes were obtained in which LacS was reconstituted in an inside-out orientation, as suggested by the outside labeling of a single cysteine mutant with a membrane impermeable biotin-maleimide. The results are consistent with a mechanism of reconstitution in which the hydrophilic regions of LacS prevent a random insertion of the protein into the membrane. Consistent with the in vivo lactose/galactose exchange catalyzed by the LacS protein, the maximal rate of lactose counterflow was almost 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of H+-lactose symport.
TI  - Detection and localization of peptidases in Lactococcus lactis with monoclonal antibodies.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies against peptidases of Lactococcus lactis were isolated and  characterized: PEPN1-4 against a lysyl aminopeptidase PepN, PEPT1-5 against a tripeptidase PepT and PEPD1-3 against a dipeptidase PepD. These monoclonal antibodies reacted specifically with their respective antigens in crude cell extracts of Lc. lactis subspp. cremoris and lactis. A number of monoclonal antibodies cross reacted with proteins of other (lactic acid) bacteria. PEPT1, 2, 4 and 5 cross reacted weakly with a 35 kDa protein in Lactobacillus delbrueckii, while PEPT1 and PEPT2 reacted with proteins in the cell-free extract of Streptococcus thermophilus and Clostridium fervidus. Of the four isolated monoclonal antibodies against PEPN, only PEPN3 cross reacted weakly with a 90 kDa protein in Escherichia coli cell-free extract, and the other three antibody species against PEPN3 cross reacted with 80 kDa proteins of Lb. casei, Lb. delbrueckii, and Str. bovis, but not of Esch. coli. Of the three monoclonal antibodies against PepD, only PEPD1 and PEPD2 cross reacted with 40 kDa proteins of Lb. casei, Lb. delbrueckii and Str. bovis. All PEPN, PEPD and PEPT antibodies reacted with components in cell-free extracts of eleven different Lc. lactis strains, indicating that the peptidases of these strains were very similar to those of Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris WG2. However, Lc. lactis subsp. hordniae appeared to differ from the other Lc. lactis subspecies since only PEPT1, 2 and 5 reacted with a protein in the cell-free extract. Immunogold labelling of Lc. lactis WG2 with the isolated monoclonal antibodies revealed that PepN, PepD and PepT were located intracellularly. The intracellular location of these peptidases is discussed in relation to the supply of essential amino acids and peptides.
TI  - The lactose transporter in Leuconostoc lactis is a new member of the LacS subfamily of galactoside-pentose-hexuronide translocators.
AB  - The gene encoding the lactose transport protein (lacS) of Leuconostoc lactis NZ6009 has been cloned from its native lactose plasmid, pNZ63, by functional complementation of lactose permease-deficient Escherichia coli mutants. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame with the capacity to encode a protein of 639 amino acids which had limited but significant identity to the lactose transport carriers (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus (34.5%) and Lactobacillus bulgaricus (35.6%). This similarity was present both in the amino-terminal hydrophobic carrier domain, which is homologous to the E. coli melibiose transporter, and in the carboxy-terminal enzyme IIA-like regulatory domain. The flanking regions of DNA surrounding lacS were also sequenced. Preceding the lacS gene was a small open reading frame in the same orientation encoding a deduced 95-amino-acid protein with a sequence similar to the amino-terminal portion of beta-galactosidase I from Bacillus stearothermophilus. The lacS gene was separated from the downstream beta-galactosidase genes (lacLM) by 2 kb of DNA containing an IS3-like insertion sequence, which is a novel arrangement for lac genes in comparison with that in other lactic acid bacteria. The lacS gene was cloned in an E. coli-Streptococcus shuttle vector and was expressed both in a lacS deletion derivative of S. thermophilus and in a pNZ63-cured strain, L. lactis NZ6091. The role of the LacS protein was confirmed by uptake assays in which substantial uptake of radiolabeled lactose or galactose was observed with L. lactis or S. thermophilus plasmids harboring an intact lacS gene. Furthermore, galactose uptake was observed in NZ6091, suggesting the presence of at least one more transport system for galactose in L. lactis.
TI  - Cation and sugar selectivity determinants in a novel family of transport proteins.
AB  - A new family of homologous membrane proteins that transport galactosides-pentoses-hexuronides (GPH) is described. By analysing the aligned amino acid sequences of the GPH family, and by exploiting their different specificities for cations and sugars, we have designed mutations that yield novel insights into the nature of ligand binding sites in membrane proteins. Mutants have been isolated/constructed in the melibiose transport proteins of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhimurium, and the lactose transport protein of Streptococcus thermophilus which facilitate uncoupled transport or have an altered cation and/or substrate specificity. Most of the mutations map in the amino-terminal region, in or near amphipathic alpha-helices II and IV, or in interhelix-loop 10-11 of the transport proteins. On the basis of the kinetic properties of these mutants, and the primary and secondary structure analyses presented here, we speculate on the cation binding pocket of this family of transporters. The regulation of the transporters through interaction with, or phosphorylation by, components of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system is also discussed.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and analysis of pWC1, a pC194-type rolling circle replicon in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - A 2.8-kb cryptic plasmid showing no homology to either pFX3 (rolling circle, pE194-type) or pCI305 (theta-type) lactococcal replicons was identified in Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris 2204. The plasmid, pWC1, was compatible with both pCI3340 (a pCI305 derivative) and pFX3 in L. lactis subsp. cremoris 2204. Sequence analysis of pWC1 showed one major ORF encoding a protein with a deduced size of 316 amino acids (aa). Database comparisons showed that the protein was distinct from the pFX- and pCI-type replication proteins (less than 21% aa identity), but shared significant homology (up to 57% aa identity) with the replication proteins from a different group of rolling circle plasmids (pC194-type) commonly found in gram-positive bacteria. A pC194-type rolling circle plasmid has not been previously described in L. lactis. Further sequence analysis showed a conserved double-stranded origin of replication in pWC1 preceded by a large (118-bp) direct repeat. The chloramphenicol-resistance gene from pC194 was inserted into a nonessential region of pWC1 to give pCP12. The host range of pCP12 included Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, but not Escherichia coli. Both pCP12 and to a lesser extent pWC1 generated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in L. lactis. A possible single-stranded origin of replication was identified by sequence analysis of pWC1 and by comparing levels of ssDNA produced by pCP12 deletion derivatives. The pWC1 replicon may be a useful addition to other replicons currently available for vector construction.
TI  - Role of intestinal bacteria in ileal ulcer formation in rats treated with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug.
AB  - The role of intestinal bacteria in induction and repression of ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with one of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 5-bromo-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl) thiophene (BFMeT), was examined in this study. BFMeT was administered by intragastric gavage once at doses of 500-1,500 mg/kg of body weight to Wistar rats treated with and without antibiotics (bacitracin, neomycin, streptomycin), germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats, and 72 hr later their gastrointestinal tracts were examined for ulcer formation. A single oral administration of BFMeT induced ileal ulcers in specific pathogen-free rats. However, the rats given antibiotics to reduce the intestinal bacteria had no ulcers. BFMeT-treated germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with Bifidobacterium adolescentis or Lactobacillus acidophilus also had no intestinal ulcers. However, the drug induced ileal ulcers in gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with Eubacterium limosum or Escherichia coli. An overnight culture of B. adolescentis or L. acidophilus or yogurt containing Bifidobacterium breve and Streptococcus thermophilus, when given as drinking water, inhibited ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with BFMeT. Gram staining of the ileal contents of normal rats revealed that 97.4% of the stained microorganisms were Gram-positive rods and only 1.2% were Gram-negative rods. In the group of rats with ulcers induced by BFMeT, the Gram-positive rods decreased by 56.4% and the Gram-negative rods including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Proteus and Bacteroides increased by 37.3%. However, in the group of rats administered the Bifidobacterium culture, the Lactobacillus culture or yogurt, the percentages of the Gram-negative rods were decreased. Although Lactobacillus was a major bacterium in the ileum of normal rats, the Gram-negative facultatively anaerobic rods E.coli, Klebsiella and Proteus were increased in the ulcerated ileum of rats treated with BFMeT, suggesting that these bacteria are associated with ulcer formation in rats treated with NSAIDs, and that Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium inhibit it by repressing the growth of ulcer-inducing bacteria.
TI  - Antagonism of lactic acid bacteria towards Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia  coli on agar plates and in milk.
AB  - The antagonistic effect of lactic acid bacteria (LAB, including Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. casei and Streptococcus thermophilus) on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was evaluated on MRS agar with the deferred and cross-streaking techniques, and in milk with the plate counting method. All LAB were repressive to S aureus and E coli on the agar medium. However, their suppressive activity was significantly reduced when the agar medium was buffered to pH 7.2. In normal milk, L acidophilus strains A and B, S thermophilus and its combinations with L acidophilus A and L bulgaricus 6032 were inhibitory to S aureus, while in mastitic milk, only S thermophilus and its combinations showed inhibition. L acidophilus A and L bulgaricus 34104 were repressive to E coli growth in normal milk. S thermophilus and its combinations were inhibitory to E coli in both the normal and mastitic milk samples. These results indicate that the antagonistic activity of LAB on pathogenic bacteria varied with the type of media in which the tests were done, and that testing of in vitro antagonism in milk would be more informative than that in artificial media for in vivo tests concerning the possible roles of competitive microbiological ecology in mastitis control.
TI  - Highly bioluminescent Streptococcus thermophilus strain for the detection of diary-relevant antibiotics in milk.
AB  - Inefficient translational initiation is often the cause of poor foreign gene expression in gram-positive organisms. The expression of bacterial luciferase (lux) genes in Streptococcus thermophilus (bioluminescence) was improved by addressing this problem in two ways; by ribosome-binding site (RBS) replacement, and by enhancing lux RBS access by polymerase chain reaction modification either alone or combined with translational coupling to a truncated upstream open- reading frame (orf') having its own RBS. Lactococcal expression signals were employed for plasmid-based lux expression. The same constructs were used to monitor bioluminescence in Lactococcus lactis, as well as two non-lactic bacterial strains, for comparison. High lux expression was achieved in all four organisms with a heterodimeric thermostable enzyme. Surprisingly, where ready access to the lux RBS was predicted, translational coupling to the lactococcal orf remained a prerequisite for detectable lux expression in L. lactis. In contrast, high bioluminescence in S. thermophilus was independent of coupling. Consistent with these observations, inspection of published gene sequences suggests that RBS "strength" may be a more important factor in translation in S. thermophilus than in L. lactis. Using reduced light production in highly bioluminescent S. thermophilus as an indicator of biocide presence in milk, test times could be significantly shortened compared with a commercial test utilizing the related non-bioluminescent strain. lux genes appear to be sensitive, exponential-phase reporters of gene activity in S. thermophilus, an organism with molecular biology and genetics that remain largely unstudied.
TI  - Regulation of glycerol and maltose uptake by the IIAGlc-like domain of IINag of the phosphotransferase system in Salmonella typhimurium LT2.
AB  - In Enterobacteriaceae the nonphosphorylated form of IIAGlc of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) can inhibit the uptake and subsequent metabolism of glycerol and maltose by binding to, and inhibiting, glycerol kinase and the MalK protein of the maltose transport system, respectively. In this report we show that the IIAGlc-like domain of the membrane-bound IIN-acetylglucosamine (IINag) of the PTS can replace IIAGlc in a Salmonella typhimurium crr mutant strain that lacks all soluble IIAGlc. The inhibition was most severe in cells which were partially induced for the glycerol or maltose uptake systems. The Streptococcus thermophilus lactose transporter LacS, which also contains a IIAGlc-like domain, could not replace IIAGlc. Neither IINag nor LacS could replace IIAGlc in activation of adenylate cyclase.
TI  - Expression of Streptomyces melC and choA genes by a cloned Streptococcus thermophilus promoter STP2201.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus (ST) chromosomal DNA (chr DNA) fragments having promoter activity were cloned and selected in Escherichia coli using a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase- (cat-) based promoter-probe vector pKK520-3. Insertion of a promoterless streptomycete melanin biosynthesis operon (melC) downstream from the promoters of the library further identified clone STP2201 as a strong promoter in E. coli. Subcloning of a STP2201-melC DNA fragment into the pMEU-series S. thermophilus-E. coli shuttle vectors yielded pEU5xML2201x plasmids that conferred Mel+ phenotype to E. coli. The pEU5aML2201a was further shown to afford a high level of tyrosinase pro-anti-tyrosinase antiserum in S. thermophilus. Substituting melC with a streptomycete cholesterol oxidase gene (choA) in the same orientation yielded pEU5aCH2201a that conferred ChoA activity to an E. coli transformant at a level of (1.06 +/- 0.15) x 10(-7) units mg-1 protein. Introduction of this plasmid into S. thermophilus by electrotransformation yielded ChoA+ transformant that produced the enzyme at about 25% of the level found in E. coli.
TI  - [Antimutagenic action of bacterial culture liquid on mutagenesis induced by 2-nitrofluorene in Salmonella typhimurium strains].
AB  - It was shown that cell extracts and cells of Streptococcus faecalis decrease the  mutagenic effect of 2-nitrofluorene in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA1538 by 73 and 48%, respectively. Cell extracts and cells of Bifidobacterium bifidum and Propionibacterium shermanii exhibited weak antimutagenic activity. No antimutagenic effect was found in Escherichia coli AB1157, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, or Streptococcus thermophilus. Antimutageneicity of the cell extract of Str. faecalis is both associated with extracellular factors interacting with 2-nitrofluorene (desmutagenesis) and with factors affecting intracellular processes of mutagen biotransformation and mutation induction. Thiol compounds produced by growing Str. faecalis may be desmutagenic factors. A relatively heat-stable substance or substances of a peptide nature with a MM less than 12 kDa are antimutagenic factors affecting intracellular processes of mutagenesis.
TI  - Kinetic analysis of lactose and proton coupling in Glu379 mutants of the lactose  transport protein of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The role of Glu379 in the lactose-H+ symport protein (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus was studied by analyzing the kinetic mechanism of transport of wild-type and Ala379, Asp379, and Gln379 mutant proteins. Glu379 forms part of the sequence motif Lys-X-X-His-X-X-Glu that is present in a number of sugar transport proteins, including LacY of Escherichia coli. The E379A and E379Q mutants were defective in the uptake of lactose against a concentration gradient and lactose-dependent proton uptake, but catalyzed facilitated influx of lactose down a concentration gradient and equilibrium exchange with rates similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. The E379D mutant was partially defective in the coupled transport of lactose and protons. These results suggest that an acidic residue at position 379 is required for the coupled uptake of lactose and protons and are consistent with a mechanism in which lactose transport in the E379A and E379Q mutants occurs by uniport rather than proton symport. Lactose efflux down a concentration gradient in wild-type LacS and LacS-E379D increased with pH with apparent pK (pKa) values of > or = 8.5 and 8.0, respectively, whereas efflux in the E379Q mutant increased sigmoidally with a pKa of about 6.0. Imposition of an artificial membrane potential (inside negative) in membrane vesicles bearing wild-type LacS or LacS-E379Q not only inhibited the lactose efflux mediated by wild-type but also that of the mutant enzyme. To associate the role of Glu379 with specific step(s) in the translocation cycle of LacS, the properties of wild-type LacS and the Glu379 mutants have been evaluated by numerical analysis of simple kinetic schemes for translocation catalysis by solute H+ symport proteins. The properties of the wild-type enzyme are consistent with a mechanism in which the order of ligand binding on the inside is substrate first and proton last, whereas the order is random (or proton first, substrate last) at the outer surface of the membrane. The wild-type enzyme is asymmetric with regard to proton binding; the pK for proton binding on the outside is at least 4 units higher than the pK on the inside. The properties of the Glu379 mutants correspond with a lowering of the pK on the outside (pKOUT approximately pKIN), and the induction of a leak pathway in which the binary enzyme-substrate complex becomes mobile.
TI  - Characterization of the gor gene of the lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ368.
AB  - Cloning and characterization of the gor gene of the lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus, encoding glutathione reductase, are described in this paper. This enzyme is a part of the enzymatic defences against oxidative stress in eukaryotic cells and in Gram-negative bacteria, but was never found in Gram-positive bacteria before this study. The amino acid sequence shares extensive similarities with glutathione reductases from other organisms, e.g. 62% amino acid identity with Escherichia coli protein. Northern blot analysis and glutathione reductase enzyme assays gave evidence that the gene is expressed in aerobically growing cells.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the galactokinase gene from Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The objective of this research was to clone and characterize the galactokinase gene (galK) from Streptococcus thermophilus F410. Partially digested genomic DNA was cloned into pBR322 and transformed into galK Escherichia coli, and a galactose-fermenting transformant was isolated. Restriction analysis revealed that the transformant resulted from a Sau3A-HindIII 4.0-kb fragment. Galactokinase activity in the recombinant was 10 times that of the parent strain. Analysis of the DNA sequence showed the presence of a 1.3-kb open reading frame that had high homology with the galK gene from other organisms. A putative ribosome-binding site, start and stop codons, and -10 and -35 sequences were identified. The predicted protein had a molecular mass of 49 kDa, which corresponded to the estimated size of a band apparent by SDS-PAGE. Amino acid sequence homologies with other galactokinases ranged from 50 to 62% similarity. Northern blots were performed between the galK gene and mRNA from S. thermophilus. No hybridization signals were observed for cells grown in glucose, but cells grown in lactose or galactose gave moderate and strong signals. The results suggest that repression of the galK gene by glucose may be responsible for the galactose-releasing phenotype in these strains.
TI  - Expression of cho and melC operons by a Streptococcus thermophilus synthetic promoter in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A 63-base-pair synthetic promoter, sP1, was synthesized on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of a putative Streptococcus thermophilus promoter. When inserted upstream from the Streptomyces cho operon in a recombinant plasmid, pUCO195P-36, sP1 activated the expression of the cho genes in Escherichia coli, as shown by the production of cholesterol oxidase by the transformants. The sP1-driven cholesterol oxidase production in pUCO195P-36-transformed cells was estimated to be 40% of that produced by P(lac)-mediated cho expression in a pUCO193-containing host. The recombinant pUCO195P-36 appeared to be segregationally less stable in E. coli DH5 alpha than in HB101. Its non-expressing counterpart, pUCO195P-1, was stable in both E. coli strains. The activity of sP1 was further demonstrated in E. coli by the expression of a Streptomyces melC operon. When placed upstream from the test operon in the pMCU22aPa construct, sP1 activated the melC expression as shown by the production of tyrosinase at (3.0 +/- 0.3) x 10(-3) U/mg and (16.0 +/- 1.0) x 10(-3) U/mg protein equivalent of cell extract in the absence and presence of isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, respectively. The presence of a counter-oriented P(lac) at the 3' end of the operon in the pMCU22bPa plasmid reduced the sP1-mediated tyrosinase production by about 85%.
TI  - [Antimutagenic action of bacteria on mutagenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in Salmonella typhimurium].
AB  - It is shown that in the presence of culture liquid and cells of Propionibacterium shermanii, P. pentosaceum, P. thoenii, P. coccoides, P. acnes, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Streptococcus thermophilus, Str. faecalis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Escherichia coli AB 1157 the mutagenicity of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO) in Salmonella typhimurium TA 100 decreases significantly. The highest antimutagenic (desmutagenic) activity was found in culture liquid from all strains tested in the logarithmic growth phase; on aging of the cultures their antimutagenic activity decreased. The cells passaged in the medium containing 4-NQO demonstrate a higher antimutagenic activity than the control cells, and this effect is not related to the cell mutation. Young cultures of all studied propionic bacteria and of Str. faecalis release thiol compounds into medium. Thiol accumulation in culture liquid from P. shermanii between 10 and 24 h was accompanied by culture transition to the active growth. Over 24 h thiol content decreased. The maximal thiol accumulation by 24 h coincided with the maximal desmutagenic activity of the culture. It is suggested that desmutagenesis of the bacteria studied towards 4-NQO is connected with their production of reducing (possibly, sulfur-containing) compounds that inactivate electrophilic groups of the mutagen.
TI  - Regulation of bacterial sugar-H+ symport by phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent enzyme  I/HPr-mediated phosphorylation.
AB  - The lactose-H+ symport protein (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus has a C-terminal hydrophilic domain that is homologous to IIA protein(s) domains of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS). C-terminal truncation mutants were constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli and their properties were analyzed. Remarkably, the entire IIA domain (160 amino acids) could be deleted without significant effect on lactose-H+ symport and galactoside equilibrium exchange. Analysis of the LacS mutants in S. thermophilus cells suggested that transport is affected by PTS-mediated phosphorylation of the IIA domain. For further studies, membrane vesicles of S. thermophilus were fused with cytochrome c oxidase-containing liposomes, and, when appropriate, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) plus purified enzyme I and heat-stable protein HPr were incorporated into the hybrid membranes. Generation of a protonmotive force (delta p) in the hybrid membranes resulted in accumulation of lactose, whereas uptake of the PTS sugar sucrose was not observed. With PEP and the energy-coupling proteins enzyme I and HPr of the PTS on the inside, high rates of sucrose uptake were observed, whereas delta p-driven lactose uptake by wild-type LacS was inhibited. This inhibition was not observed with LacS(delta 160) and LacS(H552R), indicating that PEP-dependent enzyme I/HPr-mediated phosphorylation of the IIA domain (possibly the conserved His-552 residue) modulates lactose-H+ symport activity.
TI  - Native promoter-plasmid vector system for heterologous cholesterol oxidase synthesis in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The cholesterol oxidase gene (choA) of a streptomycete was used as a model for studying heterologous gene expression in Streptococcus thermophilus, an essential bacterium in dairy food fermentations. The vectors pER82 and pER82P were developed from the 2.2-kb indigenous plasmid (pER8) of S. thermophilus ST108, and sP1, a 51-bp synthetic promoter patterned after a chromosomal sequence of S. thermophilus. The presence of sP1 promoter in pER82PbCOb with the choA insert aligned with the cat gene was essential for the intracellular production of cholesterol oxidase. The pER82PbCOb was apparently stable in S. thermophilus with no detectable evidence of deletion mutational events.
TI  - Genotyping of Streptococcus thermophilus evidenced by restriction analysis of ribosomal DNA.
AB  - Twenty strains of Streptococcus thermophilus were classified into five different  types characterized by ribotyping after DNA digestion with HindIII and hybridization with cDNA from 16S-23S rDNA of Escherichia coli. Ribotyping after digestion with HaeIII and XhoI enabled the same strains to be gathered into three groups as a consequence of the reduced influence of the flanking sequences within the analysis of rRNA operons. Amplified rDNA restriction analysis clearly confirmed the discrimination of these three different ribotypes, producing evidence to suggest that subtaxa are to be recognized within this species.
TI  - Gene cloning and characterization of PepC, a cysteine aminopeptidase from Streptococcus thermophilus, with sequence similarity to the eucaryotic bleomycin hydrolase.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ 302 contains at least three general aminopeptidases able to hydrolyze Phe-beta-naphthylamide substrate. The gene encoding one of these aminopeptidases was cloned from a total DNA library of S. thermophilus CNRZ 302 constructed in Escherichia coli TG1 using pBluescript plasmid. The wild-type TG1 strain, although not deficient in aminopeptidase activity, is unable to hydrolyze the substrate Phe-beta-naphthylamide, and thus the library could be screened with an enzymic plate assay using this substrate. One clone was selected which was shown to express an aminopeptidase, identified as a PepC-like enzyme on the basis of cross-reactivity with polyclonal antibodies directed against the lactococcal PepC cysteine aminopeptidase. The gene was further subcloned and sequenced. A complete open reading frame coding for a 445-residue (50414 Da) polypeptide was identified. 70% identity was found between the deduced amino acid sequence and the sequence of PepC from Lactococcus lactis subspecies cremoris, confirming the identity of the cloned gene. High sequence similarity (38% identity) was also found with an eucaryotic enzyme, bleomycin hydrolase. In addition, the predicted amino acid sequence of the streptococcal PepC showed a region of strong similarity to the active site of cysteine proteinases with conservation of the residues involved in the catalytic site. The product of the cloned pepC gene was overproduced in E. coli and was purified from a cellular extract. Purification to homogeneity was achieved by two-step ion-exchange chromatography. Biochemical characterization of the pure recombinant enzyme confirms that the cloned peptidase is a thiol aminopeptidase possessing a broad specificity. The enzyme has a molecular mass of 300 kDa suggesting an hexameric structure. On the basis of sequence similarities as well as common biochemical and enzymic properties, the bacterial PepC-type enzymes and the eucaryotic bleomycin hydrolase constitute a new family of thiol aminopeptidases among the cysteine peptidases.
TI  - Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the gene encoding the H2O2-forming NADH oxidase from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans induces both H2O2-forming and H2O-forming NADH oxidases in the presence of O2 [M. Higuchi, J. Gen. Microbiol., 130, 1819-1826 (1984)]. In this paper, a nox-1 gene encoding H2O2-forming NADH oxidase (NOX-1) from Streptococcus mutans was cloned, and the nucleotides sequenced. The structural gene of nox-1 consisted of 1530 base pairs, which encode a polypeptide consisting of 510 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 55,196 Da. The deduced N-terminal amino acid sequence was consistent with that previously found for the purified NOX-1 protein. The nox-1 gene was expressed in Escherichia coli using its own promoter. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of NOX-1 with those of NADH oxidases from other microorganisms showed identities of 55.6%, 20.8%, 20.3%, and 7.3% for those of Amphibacillus xylanus Ep01, Streptococcus faecalis 10C1, Thermoanaerobium brockii Rt8.G4, and Thermus thermophilus HB8, respectively.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequencing of L-lactate dehydrogenase gene from Streptococcus thermophilus M-192.
AB  - The gene encoding L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was cloned from an industrial dairy strain of Streptococcus thermophilus M-192 using a synthetic oligonucleotide probe based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The enzyme was deduced to have 328 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 35,428 and found to have high sequence similarity to LDHs from other lactic acid bacteria (89.0% to Streptococcus mutans, 76.3% to Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, 67% to Lactobacillus casei, and 60% to Lactobacillus plantarum). The gene contained a promoter-like sequence similar to the Escherichia coli promoter consensus, and expression of the S. thermophilus LDH gene was observed in E. coli cells.
TI  - Direct screening of recombinants in gram-positive bacteria using the secreted staphylococcal nuclease as a reporter.
AB  - A system for direct screening of recombinant clones in Lactococcus lactis, based  on secretion of the staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) in the organism, was developed. The nuc gene (encoding SNase) was cloned on both rolling-circle and theta-replicating plasmids. L. lactis strains containing these nuc+ plasmids secrete SNase and are readily detectable by a simple plate test. A multicloning site (MCS) was introduced just after the cleavage site between leader peptide and the mature SNase, without affecting nuclease activity. Cloning foreign DNA fragments into any site of the MCS interrupts nuc and thus results in nuc mutant clones which are easily distinguished fron nuc+ clones on plates. The utility of this system for L. lactis was demonstrated by cloning an antibiotic resistance marker and Escherichia coli chromosomal DNA fragments into the MCS of the nucMCS cassette. Both cloning vectors containing the nucMCS cassette were also introduced into Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, in which direct screening of nuc mutant recombinant clones was also achieved. The potential uses of nuc as a secretion reporter system are discussed.
TI  - Identification of the replication region of Streptococcus thermophilus No. 29 plasmid pST1.
AB  - The replication region of the 2.77-kilobases (kb) plasmid pST1 from Streptococcus thermophilus No. 29 was identified. Deletion derivatives of pST1 were introduced into plasmid-free S. thermophilus No. 29 and examined for their ability to replicate autonomously. The nucleotide sequence had one open reading frame encoded for a 315 amino acid protein (Rep). Comparisons with proteins encoded by other Gram-positive bacterial plasmids strongly suggest that the deduced protein (RepS) encoded by pST1 has a replicative role. pST1 also contains a DNA sequence similar to the origin nick sequences of pLP1 or pLAB1000, which initiate plasmid replication at the plus origin. In a maxicell system, E. coli CSR603 carrying pSTUC4 produced a protein that was considered to correspond to the product of the RepS gene. These results strongly suggest that pST1 is replicated following a rolling-circle mechanism via single-stranded DNA intermediates.
TI  - Shuttle vectors developed from Streptococcus thermophilus native plasmid.
AB  - pER8 (2.2 kb), a native plasmid of Streptococcus thermophilus ST108, was used to  develop pMEU-series shuttle vectors. In addition to the replication function of the pER8, these vectors contain origin of replication and beta-lactamase gene (bla) of Escherichia coli vector pUC18/19, the cat gene of pC194, and the pPV141-borne erm determinant of Staphylococcus hyicus ssp. chromogenes 3688. pMEU5a, pMEU5b, pMEU6a, and pMEU6b (all 5.7 kb in size) contain bla and erm markers, are capable of transforming E. coli and S. thermophilus at frequencies in the order of 10(5)-10(6) and 10(3) colony forming units (CFU)/microgram DNA, respectively, and are highly stable in the two host systems. pMEU9 and pMEU10 (both 6.9 kb) contain the cat marker in addition to the DNA elements found in pMEU5-6. These plasmids are also highly effective in transforming E. coli (at ca. 6 x 10(5) CFU/microgram DNA) and S. thermophilus (ca. 10(3) CFU/microgram DNA). Although expression of the resistance markers is not completely consistent, pMEU9 and pMEU10 remain important shuttle vectors for clonal selection by an insertional inactivation method.
TI  - Directed genomic integration, gene replacement, and integrative gene expression in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Several pGEM5- and pUC19-derived plasmids containing a selectable erythromycin resistance marker were integrated into the chromosome of Streptococcus thermophilus at the loci of the lactose-metabolizing genes. Integration occurred via homologous recombination and resulted in cointegrates between plasmid and genome, flanked by the homologous DNA used for integration. Selective pressure on the plasmid-located erythromycin resistance gene resulted in multiple amplifications of the integrated plasmid. Release of this selective pressure, however, gave way to homologous resolution of the cointegrate structures. By integration and subsequent resolution, we were able to replace the chromosomal lacZ gene with a modified copy carrying an in vitro-generated deletion. In the same way, we integrated a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene between the chromosomal lacS and lacZ genes of the lactose operon. The inserted cat gene became a functional part of the operon and was expressed and regulated accordingly. Selective pressure on the essential lacS and lacZ genes under normal growth conditions in milk ensures the maintenance and expression of the integrated gene. As there are only minimal repeated DNA sequences (an NdeI site) flanking the inserted cat gene, it was stably maintained even in the absence of lactose, i.e., when grown on sucrose or glucose. The methodology represents a stable system in which to express and regulate foreign genes in S. thermophilus, which could qualify in the future for an application with food.
TI  - Purification, cloning, and cofactor independence of glutamate racemase from Lactobacillus.
AB  - Glutamate racemase has been purified more than 12,000-fold from Lactobacillus fermenti. The racemase gene has been cloned using standard hybridization techniques combined with a novel selection for in vivo glutamate racemase activity, and the racemase has been expressed in Escherichia coli as 20-25% of the total soluble cell protein. The cloned gene product is indistinguishable from that purified from Lactobacillus and is a monomer of M(r) 28,300. Both a coupled enzymatic assay and a circular dichroism assay show that the enzyme follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with a Km of 0.3 mM and a kcat of 70 s-1 in each reaction direction. Investigations into the cofactor dependence of glutamate racemase indicate that the enzyme employs neither pyridoxal phosphate nor a pyruvoyl group in the labilization of the proton at the stereogenic center of glutamate. Furthermore, the racemase activity is unaffected by the presence of the metal-chelating reagent EDTA. The gene sequence of the racemase is 24% identical to that of aspartate racemase from Streptococcus thermophilus and 30% identical to that of an unidentified open reading frame in the rrnB ribosomal RNA operon of E. coli. Because the two cysteine residues in glutamate racemase and their surrounding regions are well-conserved in both of these sequences, and since glutamate racemase is stabilized by the presence of reduced thiols, these residues are possible candidates for the enzymic bases that deprotonate glutamate at C-2.
TI  - Lactose transport system of Streptococcus thermophilus. Functional reconstitution of the protein and characterization of the kinetic mechanism of transport.
AB  - The kinetic mechanism of the lactose transport system of Streptococcus thermophilus was studied in membrane vesicles fused with cytochrome c oxidase containing liposomes and in proteoliposomes in which cytochrome c oxidase was coreconstituted with the lactose transport protein. Selective manipulation of the components of the proton (and sodium) motive force indicated that both a membrane potential and a pH gradient could drive transport. The galactoside/proton stoichiometry was close to unity. Experiments which discriminate between the effects of internal pH and delta pH as driving force on galactoside/proton symport showed that the carrier is highly activated at alkaline internal pH values, which biases the transport system kinetically toward the pH component of the proton motive force. Galactoside efflux increased with increasing pH with a pKa of about 8, whereas galactoside exchange (and counterflow) exhibited a pH optimum around 7 with pKa values of 6 and 8, respectively. Imposition of delta pH (interior alkaline) retarded the rate of efflux at any pH value tested, whereas the rate of exchange was stimulated by an imposed delta pH at pH 5.8, not affected at pH 7.0, and inhibited at pH 8.0 and 9.0. The results have been evaluated in terms of random and ordered association/dissociation of galactoside and proton on the inner surface of the membrane. Imposition of delta psi (interior negative) decreased the rate of efflux but had no effect on the rate of exchange, indicating that the unloaded transport protein carries a net negative charge and that during exchange and counterflow the carrier recycles in the protonated form.
TI  - Properties of aspartate racemase, a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-independent amino acid racemase.
AB  - Aspartate racemase from Streptococcus thermophilus contains no pyridoxal 5'-phosphate or other cofactors such as FAD, NAD+, and metal ions. It was affected by neither carbonyl reagents such as hydroxylamine nor sodium borohydride but was strongly inhibited by iodoacetamide and other thiol reagents. Aspartate, cysteate, and cysteine sulfinate were the only substrates. The Km values for L- and D-aspartate were 35 and 8.7 mM, respectively. The enzyme catalyzed the exchange of alpha-hydrogen of the substrate with the solvent hydrogen. Racemization of L-aspartate in 2H2O showed an overshooting in the optical rotation of aspartate before the substrate was fully racemized. This shows that the removal of alpha-hydrogen of the substrate is at least partially rate-determining. When L- or D-aspartate was incubated with aspartate racemase in tritiated water, tritium was incorporated preferentially into the product enantiomer. The results strongly suggest that aspartate racemase contains two hydrogen acceptors.
TI  - Construction and characterization of shuttle plasmids for lactic acid bacteria and Escherichia coli.
AB  - The chimeric plasmid pBN183 was first constructed in Escherichia coli by ligating the BamHI-digested E. coli plasmid pBR322 and a Bg/II-linearized streptococcal plasmid, pNZ18. The pBN183 transformed E. coli to ApR at a frequency of (8.2 +/- 1.2) x 10(5) colony forming units (CFU)/microgram DNA. Electrotransformation of Streptococcus thermophilus with pBN183 yielded CmR, ApS clones at a frequency of (2.6 +/- 0.3) x 10(1) CFU/microgram DNA. Plasmid screening with pBN183-transformed S. thermophilus clones revealed that ca. 70% of these transformants contained deleted plasmids. Plasmid pBN183A, a pBN183 deletion mutant lacking one copy of a tandemly arranged, highly homologous DNA sequence, was isolated for further study. It transformed E. coli to ApR and S. thermophilus to CmR with frequencies of (4.8 +/- 0.1) x 10(5) and (8.1 +/- 0.2) x 10(2) CFU/microgram DNA, respectively. Screening of S. thermophilus transformants did not show the presence of deleted plasmids. Based on the structure of pBN183A, a new shuttle plasmid, pDBN183, was constructed from pBN183 by removal of the small (1.2 kb) Sa/I fragment. Transformation frequencies of pDBN183 were (5.0 +/- 1.3) x 10(5) and (4.6 +/- 0.2) x 10(2) CFU/microgram DNA with E. coli and S. thermophilus, respectively. In contrast to the parent pBN183, only 17% of the pDBN183-transformed S. thermophilus contained deleted plasmids. Plasmid copy numbers of the three vectors in E. coli were estimated at 17-18 per chromosome. The three plasmids conferred ApR and CmR to E. coli, but only CmR to S. thermophilus. The insertion of a Streptomyces cholesterol oxidase gene (choA) into pDBN183 did not affect the plasmid's stability in Lactobacillus casei, but resulted in deletion of the recombinant DNA in S. thermophilus.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the melB gene encoding the melibiose permease of Salmonella typhimurium LT2.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the melB gene coding for the Na+ (Li+)/melibiose symporter of Salmonella typhimurium LT2 was determined, and its amino acid sequence was deduced. It consists of 1428 bp, corresponding to a protein of 476 amino acid residues (calculated molecular weight 52,800). The amino acid sequence is homologous to that of the melibiose permease of Escherichia coli K12, with 85% identical residues. All, except one, of the amino acid residues that have been reported to be important for cation or substrate recognition in the melibiose permease of E. coli are conserved in the melibiose permease of S. typhimurium. In addition, part of the sequence resembles the lactose permease of Streptococcus thermophilus, the animal glucose transporter (GLUT1), the plasmid-coded raffinose permease (RafB), and the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 4 (Nuo4) of Aspergillus amstelodami.
TI  - Lactose transport system of Streptococcus thermophilus. The role of histidine residues.
AB  - The lactose transport protein (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus is a chimeric  protein consisting of an amino-terminal carrier domain and a carboxyl-terminal phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) IIA protein domain. The histidine residues of LacS were changed individually into glutamine or arginine residues. Of the 11 histidine residues present in LacS, only the His-376 substitution in the carrier domain significantly affected sugar transport. The region around His-376 was found to exhibit sequence similarity to the region around His-322 of the lactose transport protein (LacY) of Escherichia coli, which has been implicated in sugar binding and in coupling of sugar and H+ transport. The H376Q mutation resulted in a reduced rate of uptake and altered affinity for lactose (beta-galactoside), melibiose (alpha-galactoside), and the lactose analog methyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside. Similarly, the extent of accumulation of the galactosides by cells expressing LacS(H376Q) was highly reduced in comparison to cells bearing the wild-type protein. Nonequilibrium exchange of lactose and methyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside by the H376Q mutant was approximately 2-fold reduced in comparison to the activity of the wild-type transport protein. The data indicate that His-376 is involved in sugar recognition and is important, but not essential, for the cotransport of protons and galactosides. The carboxyl-terminal domain of LacS contains 2 histidine residues (His-537 and His-552) that are conserved in seven homologous IIA protein(s) (domains) of PTSs. P-enolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of wild-type LacS, but not of the mutant H552Q, was demonstrated using purified Enzyme I and HPr, the general energy coupling proteins of the PTS, and inside-out membrane vesicles isolated from E. coli in which the lactose transport gene was expressed. The His-537 and His-552 mutations did not affect transport activity when the corresponding genes were expressed in E. coli.
TI  - Galactose utilization in Lactobacillus helveticus: isolation and characterization of the galactokinase (galK) and galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (galT) genes.
AB  - By complementing appropriate gal lesions in Escherichia coli K802, we were able to isolate the galactokinase (galK) and galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (galT) genes of Lactobacillus helveticus. Tn10 transposon mutagenesis, together with in vivo complementation analysis and in vitro enzyme activity measurements, allowed us to map these two genes. The DNA sequences of the genes and the flanking regions were determined. These revealed that the two genes are organized in the order galK-galT in an operonlike structure. In an in vitro transcription-translation assay, the galK and galT gene products were identified as 44- and 53-kDa proteins, respectively, data which corresponded well with the DNA sequencing data. The deduced amino acid sequence of the galK gene product showed significant homologies to other prokaryotic and eukaryotic galactokinase sequences, whereas galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase did not show any sequence similarities to other known proteins. This observation, together with a comparison of known gal operon structures, suggested that the L. helveticus operon developed independently to a translational expression unit having a different gene order than that in E. coli, Streptococcus lividans, or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. DNA sequencing of the flanking regions revealed an open reading frame downstream of the galKT operon. It was tentatively identified as galM (mutarotase) on the basis of the significant amino acid sequence homology with the corresponding Streptococcus thermophilus gene.
TI  - Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequencing of the aspartate racemase gene from lactic acid bacteria Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The gene coding aspartate racemase (EC 5.1.1.13) was cloned from the lactic acid  bacteria Streptococcus thermophilus IAM10064 and expressed efficiently in Escherichia coli. The 2.1 kilobase pairs long full length clone had an open reading frame of 729 nucleotides coding for 243 amino acids. The calculated molecular weight of 27,945 agreed well with the apparent molecular weight of 28,000 found in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the aspartate racemase purified from S. thermophilus. The N-terminal amino acid sequence from the purified protein exactly matches the derived sequence. In addition, the amino acid composition compiled from the derived sequence is very similar to that obtained from the purified recombinant protein. No significantly homologous proteins were found in a protein sequence data bank. Even the homology scores with alanine racemases of Salmonella typhimurium and Bacillus stearothermophilus were low. Aspartate racemase was overproduced in Escherichia coli NM522 with plasmid pAG6-2-7, which was constructed from two copies of the gene linked with a tac promoter and plasmid vector pUC18. The amount of aspartate racemase increases with the growth of E. coli and almost no degradation of the enzyme was observed. The maximum amount of the produced enzyme reached approx. 20% of the total protein of E. coli.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of chromosomal promoters of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus.
AB  - A promoter probe vector, pTG244, was constructed with the aim of isolating transcription initiation signals from Streptococcus thermophilus (Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus). pTG244 is based on the Escherichia coli-streptococcus shuttle vector pTG222, into which the promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene of Bacillus pumilus (cat-86) was cloned. Random Sau3A fragments from the S. thermophilus A054 chromosomal DNA were cloned upstream of the cat-86 gene by using E. coli as the host. The pool of recombinant plasmids were introduced into S. thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis in order to search for promoter activity in these hosts. For S. thermophilus, it was necessary to first select erythromycin-resistant transformants and then to screen for chloramphenicol resistance among these. Direct selection of chloramphenicol-resistant clones was, however, possible in L. lactis subsp. lactis. Six fragments exhibiting promoter activity were characterized in S. thermophilus by measuring the levels of cat-86 transcription and/or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase specific activity. Three of the promoter-carrying fragments were sequenced. The 5' ends of their corresponding mRNAs were determined by S1 mapping and shown to correspond to a purine residue in all cases. Upstream from these potential transcription start points, sequences homologous to the E. coli sigma 70 and the Bacillus subtilis vegetative sigma 43 (or sigma A) consensus promoters were identified.
TI  - Inhibition of Clostridium tyrobutyricum by bacteriocin-like substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were selected for their inhibitory activity against Clostridium tyrobutyricum under conditions that eliminate the effects of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide. Four strains were isolated belonging to the species Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. The sensitivity of the inhibitory substances to pronase and trypsine indicates that they are proteins or peptides different from nisin. Their resistance to phospholipase D indicates that they are also different from lactostrepcin. The inhibitory substances are produced during the exponential phase of growth. Their activity is bactericidal and directed toward some strains of Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Streptococcus thermophilus, but strains used as dairy starters, Lactobacillus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Propionibacterium shermanii, are not all affected by the inhibition.
TI  - [Cloning the gene of beta-galactosidase from the industrial strain of Streptococcus lactis 111 in E. coli cells and conjugated transfer of this gene to Streptococcus thermophilus cells].
AB  - The ability of the industrial strains of Streptococcus lactis to synthesize the enzyme beta-galactosidase was studied. Five strains among sixteen were found to produce high levels of the enzyme. The beta-galactosidase gene in the most active strain Streptococcus lactis 111 was shown to be located on the 50 kb conjugative plasmid. The plasmid was transferred by conjugation into Streptococcus thermophilus cells and subsequently the gene for beta-galactosidase was studied in transconjugants. The beta-galactosidase gene from Streptococcus lactis 111 was subcloned in Escherichia coli cells on the plasmid pBR322. The gene was localized on the 4.8 kb BgIII fragment of DNA. Following the restriction of DNA by the Sau3A the gene was subcloned on the birepliconed plasmid vector pCB20 capable of replication in the Gram-negative as well as Gram-positive microorganisms. The recombinant derivatives of pCB20 were isolated that carry the beta-galactosidase gene on the DNA fragments of different size.
TI  - Lactose metabolism in Lactobacillus bulgaricus: analysis of the primary structure and expression of the genes involved.
AB  - The genes coding for the lactose permease and beta-galactosidase, two proteins involved in the metabolism of lactose by Lactobacillus bulgaricus, have been cloned, expressed, and found functional in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequences of these genes and their flanking regions have been determined, showing the presence of two contiguous open reading frames (ORFs). One of these ORFs codes for the lactose permease gene, and the other codes for the beta-galactosidase gene. The lactose permease gene is located in front of the beta-galactosidase gene, with 3 bp in the intergenic region. The two genes are probably transcribed as one operon. Primer extension studies have mapped a promoter upstream from the lactose permease gene but not the beta-galactosidase gene. This promoter is similar to those found in E. coli with general characteristics of GC-rich organisms. In addition, the sequences around the promoter contain a significantly higher number of AT base pairs (80%) than does the overall L. bulgaricus genome, which is rich in GC (GC content of 54%). The amino acid sequences obtained from translation of the ORFs are found to be highly homologous (similarity of 75%) to those from Streptococcus thermophilus. The first 460 amino acids of the lactose permease shows homology to the melibiose transport protein of E. coli. Little homology was found between the lactose permease of L. bulgaricus and E. coli, but the residues which are involved in the binding and the transport of lactose are conserved. The carboxy terminus is similar to that of the enzyme III of several phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase systems.
TI  - Analysis of the lacZ sequences from two Streptococcus thermophilus strains: comparison with the Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus bulgaricus beta-galactosidase sequences.
AB  - The lacZ gene from Streptococcus thermophilus A054, a commercial yogurt strain, was cloned on a 7.2 kb PstI fragment in Escherichia coli and compared with the previously cloned lacZ gene from S. thermophilus ATCC 19258. Using the dideoxy chain termination method, the DNA sequences of both lacZ structural genes were determined and found to be 3071 bp in length. When the two sequences were more closely analysed, 21 nucleotide differences were detected, of which only nine resulted in amino acid changes in the proteins, the remainder occurring in wobble positions of the respective codons. Only three bases separated the termination codon for the lacS gene from the initiation codon for lacZ, suggesting that the lactose utilization genes are organized as an operon. The amino acid sequence of the beta-galactosidase, derived from the DNA sequence, corresponds to a protein with a molecular mass of 116860 Da. Comparison of the S. thermophilus amino acid sequences with those from Lactobacillus bulgaricus, E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae showed 48, 35 and 32.5% identity respectively. Although little sequence homology was observed at the DNA level, many regions conserved in the amino acid sequence were identified when the beta-galactosidase proteins from S. thermophilus, E. coli and L. bulgaricus were compared.
TI  - Carbohydrate utilization in Streptococcus thermophilus: characterization of the genes for aldose 1-epimerase (mutarotase) and UDPglucose 4-epimerase.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequences of the genes encoding aldose 1-epimerase (mutarotase) (galM) and UDPglucose 4-epimerase (galE) and flanking regions of Streptococcus thermophilus have been determined. Both genes are located immediately upstream of the S. thermophilus lac operon. To facilitate the isolation of galE, a special polymerase chain reaction-based technique was used to amplify the region upstream of galM prior to cloning. The galM protein was homologous to the mutarotase of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, whereas the galE protein was homologous to UDPglucose 4-epimerase of Escherichia coli and Streptomyces lividans. The amino acid sequences of galM and galE proteins also showed significant similarity with the carboxy-terminal and amino-terminal domains, respectively, of UDPglucose 4-epimerase from Kluyveromyces lactis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting that the yeast enzymes contain an additional, yet unidentified (mutarotase) activity. In accordance with the open reading frames of the structural genes, galM and galE were expressed as polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 39 and 37 kilodaltons, respectively. Significant activities of mutarotase and UDPglucose 4-epimerase were detected in lysates of E. coli cells containing plasmids encoding galM and galE. Expression of galE in E. coli was increased 300-fold when the gene was placed downstream of the tac promoter. The gene order for the gal-lac gene cluster of S. thermophilus is galE-galM-lacS-lacZ. The flanking regions of these genes were searched for consensus promoter sequences and further characterized by primer extension analysis. Analysis of mRNA levels for the gal and lac genes in S. thermophilus showed a strong reduction upon growth in medium containing glucose instead of lactose. The activities of the lac (lactose transport and beta-galactosidase) and gal (UDPglucose 4-epimerase) proteins of lactose- and glucose-grown S. thermophilus cells matched the mRNA levels.
TI  - [Cloning of the Streptococcus thermophilus beta-galactosidase gene and its expression in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis cells].
AB  - The beta-galactosidase gene from the chromosome of Streptococcus thermophilus, strain 6 kb, has been cloned on a vector plasmid pBR322. The corresponding gene has been found to be located on the Pst1 DNA fragment. The restriction map of this 6 kb fragment has been constructed. The shortening of the DNA fragment carrying the beta-galactosidase gene has been achieved by digestion of the recombinant derivative of pBR322 by the restriction endonuclease Sau3A under the conditions of incomplete hydrolysis. The obtained fragments have been cloned into the BamHI site in the berepliconed shuttle vector pCB20 for grampositive and gramnegative bacteria. The obtained recombinant plasmids contained the beta-galactosidase gene in the inserted fragments of different length. Expression of the cloned beta-galactosidase gene in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis cells has been studied.
TI  - Lactose transport system of Streptococcus thermophilus: a hybrid protein with homology to the melibiose carrier and enzyme III of phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase systems.
AB  - The gene responsible for the transport of lactose into Streptococcus thermophilus (lacS) was cloned in Escherichia coli as a 4.2-kilobase fragment from an EcoRI library of chromosomal DNA by using the vector pKK223-3. From deletion analysis, the gene for lactose transport mapped to two HindIII fragments with a total size of 2.8 kilobases. The gene was transcribed in E. coli from its own promoter. Functional expression of lactose transport activity was shown by assaying for the uptake and exchange of lactose both in intact cells and in membrane vesicles. The nucleotide sequence of lacS and 200 to 300 bases of 3' and 5' flanking regions were determined. The gene was 1,902 base pairs long, encoding a 69,454-dalton protein with an NH2-terminal hydrophobic region and a COOH-terminal hydrophilic region. The NH2-terminal end was homologous with the melibiose carrier of E. coli (23% similarity overall; greater than 50% similarity for regions with at least 16 amino acids), whereas the COOH-terminal end showed 34 to 41% similarity with the enzyme III (domain) of three different phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase systems. Among the conserved amino acids were two histidyl residues, of which one has been postulated to be phosphorylated by HPr. Since sugars are not phosphorylated during translocation by the lactose transport system, it is suggested that the enzyme III-like region serves a regulatory function in this protein. The lacS gene also appears similar to the partially sequenced lactose transport gene of Lactobacillus bulgaricus (lacL; greater than 60% similarity). Furthermore, the 3' flanking sequence of the S. thermophilus lactose transport gene showed approximately 50% similarity with the N-terminal portion of the beta-galactosidase gene of L. bulgaricus. In both organisms, the lactose transport gene and the beta-galactosidase appear to be separated by a 3-base-pair intercistronic region.
TI  - Molecular cloning of lactose genes in dairy lactic streptococci: the phospho-beta-galactosidase and beta-galactosidase genes and their expression products.
AB  - The mesophilic (S. lactis and S. cremoris) and thermophilic (S. thermophilus) dairy lactic streptococci, which are used in industrial dairy fermentations, contain two different lactose hydrolysing enzymes, a phospho-beta-galactosidase and a beta-galactosidase. The central role of these enzymes in the pathways used for lactose transport and degradation is discussed along with their properties and distributions in lactic streptococci. In addition, recent results on the cloning, expression and sequence organization of the genes for the mesophilic phospho-beta-galactosidase and thermophilic beta-galactosidase are reviewed. Original data are presented concerning heterologous gene expression in the study of lactose hydrolysis in lactic streptococci. These include 1) the purification of the S. lactis phospho-beta-galactosidase from an overproducing Escherichia coli, and 2) the expression of the E. coli beta-galactosidase (lacZ) gene in S. lactis employing a lactic streptococcal expression vector.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the beta-D-galactosidase gene from Streptococcus thermophilus in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The beta-D-galactosidase (beta-gal) gene from Streptococcus thermophilus was cloned to isolate and characterize it for potential use as a selection marker in a food-grade cloning vector. Chromosomal DNA from S. thermophilus 19258 was cleaved with the restriction enzyme PstI and ligated to pBR322 for transformation into Escherichia coli JM108. A beta-galactosidase-positive clone was detected by its blue color on a medium supplemented with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactoside. This transformant possessed a single plasmid, designated pRH116, which contained, in addition to the vector DNA, a 7.0-kilobase (kb) PstI insertion fragment coding for beta-gal activity. An extract from JM108(pRH116) contained a beta-gal protein with the same electrophoretic mobility as the beta-gal from S. thermophilus 19258. Compared with the beta-gal from E. coli HB101, the S. thermophilus beta-gal was of lower molecular weight. A restriction map of pRH116 was constructed from cleavage of both the plasmid and the purified insert. The construction of deletion derivatives of pRH116 with BglII, BstEII, and HindIII revealed the approximate location of the gene on the 7.0-kb fragment. The beta-gal gene was further localized to a 3.85-kb region.
TI  - Stimulation of Streptococcus thermophilus growth in mastitic milk.
AB  - Growth of Streptococcus thermophilus was faster in mastitic milk, aseptically collected following intramammary infusion of Escherichia coli endotoxin, than in normal aseptically collected milk. The contribution of polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN), of plasma and plasmin to this stimulation has been investigated. Addition of plasmin to low cell count milk stimulated growth of the streptococcus to the same degree as mastitic milk. However, addition of plasma or PMN from blood or from milk were less stimulatory. The part played by these components in providing casein breakdown products for the weakly proteolytic Str. thermophilus in mastitic milk is discussed.
TI  - Binding of the Fluorescent probes 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate and N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine to bacteria.
AB  - Changes in fluorescence intensities in Pseudomonas fluorescens, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Bacillus subtilis were investigated by means of the fluorescence probes (1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate and N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine) during a temperature programmed run. A decrease in fluorescence intensity was observed in all investigated organisms when the temperature was elevated from 4 to about 40 degrees C. A strong increase in fluorescence intensity was found in gram-negative Ps. fluorescens and E. coli when the temperature was elevated over 40 degrees C. On the other hand, only a slight enhancement in fluorescence intensities was observed in gram-positive Str. thermophilus and B. subtilis when the lipid specific dye NPN was applied at elevated temperatures. Discontinuities in all the fluorescence temperature profiles were found between 20 and 30 degrees C in the case of both ANS and NPN. With ANS the fluorescence profiles turned upwards and with NPN downwards after the inflection points. The effects of KCl, NH4Cl, NaCl and LiCl on ANS binding differed from those detected for NPN. Saturation of probe binding was reached at lower salt concentrations in the case of NPN than ANS, but depended somewhat on temperature.
