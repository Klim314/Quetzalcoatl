TI  - Beta-lactamase production and antimicrobial susceptibility of subgingival bacteria from refractory periodontitis.
AB  - This study assessed the extent of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in subgingival plaque samples obtained from 25 patients with refractory marginal periodontitis in the USA. beta-Lactamase-positive isolates were characterized using commercial diagnostic kits and partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The susceptibilities to different antimicrobial agents were tested and, in addition, the isolates were screened for the presence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were detected in 18 (72%) patients. The most prominent beta-lactamase-producing organisms belonged to the anaerobic genus Prevotella. Other enzyme-producing anaerobic strains were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus sp. Facultative bacteria, such as Burkholderia spp., Ralstonia pickettii, Capnocytophaga spp., Bacillus spp., Staphylococcus spp. and Neisseria sp., were also detected among the enzyme-producers. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ampicillin and amoxicillin were in the range 1.5-256 micrograms/ml and 4-256 micrograms/ml, respectively, for the isolates of the Prevotella species. All Prevotella isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate and metronidazole, but they showed variable resistance to tetracyclines. Two of the Prevotella isolates had high MICs of cefotaxime and ceftazidime. ESBL activity was not detected in any of the beta-lactamase-producing isolates by the Etest method. Thus, our study demonstrated a wide variety of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria that may play a role in refractory periodontal disease.
TI  - Microbial keratitis in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Posterior segment complications of systemic infection with the human  immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are well recognized. The anterior segment complications often are, however, overlooked. The author treated 20 episodes of nonherpetic infectious keratitis in 17 eyes of 13 patients infected with HIV who presented between August 1990 and May 1994. METHODS: Review of records. RESULTS: Nine patients were women, and four were men. Mean age was 35.2 years. The keratitis was bilateral in four patients, polymicrobial in four, and recurrent in two. The most common infecting organism was Candida albicans (5 eyes), a rare cause of keratitis in immunocompetent individuals. Other organisms included Staphylococcus aureus in four eyes, Staphylococcus epidermidis in four, Bacillus sp in two, and one each Pseudomonas aeruginosa, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus, Micrococcus sp, and Capnocytophaga sp. Seven eyes retained 20/30 or better visual acuity after treatment, eight had visual acuity of 20/50 or worse, and two were eviscerated. Classic predisposing factors for infectious keratitis were found in only two patients and included contact lens wear and atopy in one patient each. Twelve patients had a history of intravenous drug abuse. CONCLUSION: Infectious keratitis should be recognized as a complication of systemic HIV infection, especially in the context of drug abuse. The prognosis for recovery of vision in these patients often is poor.
