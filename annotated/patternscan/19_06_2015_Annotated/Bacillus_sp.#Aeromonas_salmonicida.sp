TI  == bactericidal efficacy of elevated ph on fish pathogenic and environmental bacteria.
AB  == ship ballast water is a recognized medium for transfer and introductions of nonindigenous species. there is a need for new ballast water treatment methods that effectively and safely eliminate or greatly minimize movements of these species. the present study employed laboratory methods to evaluate the bactericidal efficacy of increased ph (ph 10.0-12.0) for exposure durations of up to 72 h to kill a variety of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria including fish pathogens (aeromonas spp., yersinia ruckeri, edwardsiella ictaluri, serratia liquefaciens, carnobacterium sp.), other common aquatic-inhabitant bacteria (serratia marcescens, pseudomonas fluorescens, staphylococcus sp., bacillus sp.)  and indicators listed in international maritime organization d2 standards; namely, vibrio cholera (an environmental isolate from fish), escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis. volumes of 5 n naoh were added to tryptic soy broth to obtain desired ph adjustments. viable cells were determined after 0, 4, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h. initial (0 h) cell numbers ranged from 3.40 x 10(4) cfu/ml for bacillus sp. to 2.44 x 10(7) cfu/ml for e. faecalis. the effective endpoints of ph and treatment duration necessary to realize 100% bactericidal effect varied; however, all bacteria tested were killed within 72 h at ph 12.0 or lower. the lowest parameters examined, 4 h at ph 10.0, were bactericidal to v. cholera, e. ictaluri, three of four isolates of e. coli, and (three of four) aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida. bactericidal effect was attained at ph 10.0 within 12 h for the other a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, and within 24 h for  p. fluorescens, and the remaining e. coli.

TI  == discovery of novel biopreservation agents with inhibitory effects on growth of food-borne pathogens and their application to seafood products.
AB  == selection of protective cultures is relevant in order to biopreserve and improve  the functional safety of food products, mainly through inhibition of spoilage and/or pathogenic bacteria. accordingly, the present study investigated potential applications of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in the biopreservation of fish and shellfish products. for this purpose, a collection of 84 lab strains isolated from sea bass (dicentrarchus labrax) and sea bream (sparus aurata) was identified and characterized for their inhibitory activities against the most relevant seafood-spoilage and pathogenic bacteria potentially present in commercial products. the bioactive strains belonged to the genus enterococcus and exhibited  inhibition against carnobacterium sp, bacillus sp, listeria monocytogenes, aeromonas salmonicida, aeromonas hydrophila and vibrio anguillarum. treatment of  cell-free extracts of the lab strains with proteases revealed the proteinaceous nature of the inhibition. interestingly, the cell-free extracts containing bacteriocins remained 100% active after treatment up to 100 degrees c for 30 min  or 121 degrees c for 15 min. molecular analysis led to identification of the bacteriocins investigated, including enterocins a, b, l50 and p. all of these proteins demonstrated remarkable anti-listeria activity and were found to be heat-resistant small class iia bacteriocins. the results presented in this work open the way for potential applications of these lab strains to the biopreservation of minimally-processed seafood products.

TI  == defensin of the zebra mussel (dreissena polymorpha): molecular structure, in vitro expression, antimicrobial activity, and potential functions.
AB  == a 409 bp full length defensin gene was cloned and sequenced based on an expressed sequence tag (est) obtained from a normalized zebra mussel (dreissena polymorpha) foot cdna library developed in our laboratory. the d. polymorpha defensin (dpd) gene encoded a peptide with 76 amino acid residues. the mature dpd contains 54 amino acids with a fully functional insect defensin a domain. homologue searching against genbank database suggested that this dpd was phylogenetically close to defensins from a group of insects with six conserved cysteine residues. predicted with homology-modeling method, the three-dimensional structure of dpd also demonstrated a significant similarity with insect defensin a. the recombinant dpd was in vitro expressed through an escherichia coli expression system. the antimicrobial activities of the refolded recombinant dpd were found against the growth of morganella sp., plesiomonas shigelloides, edwardsiella tarda, e. coli and staphylococcus aureus aureus (atcc12598) with the minimal inhibition concentration (mic) 0.35, 0.43, 1.16, 6.46, and 30.39 microm, respectively. however, with less than 50 microm no detectable inhibition activities were observed against the other four gram-negative bacteria (aeromonas salmonicida salmonicida, motile aeromonas, flavobacterium sp., pseudomonas fluorescens, shewanella putrifaciens), as well as the other gram-positive bacteria (bacillus megaterium atcc14581, carnobacterium maltaromaticum atcc27865, enterococcus faecalis atcc19433, and micrococcus leteus atcc4698), and the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. the rna fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) of dpd in the zebra  mussel suggested that the dpd was expressed in a variety of tissues, such as foot, retractor muscle, ctenidium, mantle, hemocytes, gonad, digestive gland, and intestine. by using the quantitative pcr, the expression level of dpd in the zebra mussel foot was the highest, followed by the muscle. by comparing the amount of dpd transcripts in the zebra mussel foot under two different byssogenesis conditions (byssogenesis and non-byssogenesis) with qpcr, we found that the higher expression levels of dpd were always associated with the byssogenesis status from 2 to 4 days after the start of byssogenesis. findings of this study suggest that the expression of the dpd gene was upregulated in vivo by byssogeneis, and by hemocytes in vitro upon stimulation with microbial antigens.

TI  == the development of probiotics for the control of multiple bacterial diseases of rainbow trout, oncorhynchus mykiss (walbaum).
AB  == jb-1 and gc2, which were equated with bacillus sp. and aeromonas sobria respectively, were recovered from the digestive tract of rainbow trout, oncorhynchus mykiss and ghost carp, cyprinus sp. respectively, and demonstrated effectiveness as probiotics for the control of infections caused by aeromonas salmonicida, lactococcus garvieae, streptococcus iniae, vibrio anguillarum, vibrio ordalii and yersinia ruckeri. when administered to rainbow trout (average  weight = 12 g) for 14 days in feed dosed at 2 x 10(8) cells g(-1) of feed, jb-1 led to a reduction in mortalities to 0-13% after challenge with a range of bacterial pathogens compared to 80-100% mortalities of the controls. similarly, use of gc2 reduced mortalities to 0-16% following the challenge compared to 80-100% mortalities of the controls. the mode of action reflected nutrition, production of inhibitory substances and stimulation of the innate immune responses. specifically, jb-1 and especially gc2 were positive for siderophore and chitinase production, and increased lysozyme, phagocytic and respiratory burst activity.
