TI  == critical aspects of analysis of micrococcus luteus, neisseria cinerea, and pseudomonas fluorescens by means of capillary electrophoresis.
AB  == within the frame of our study we investigated microccocus luteus, neisseria cinerea, and pseudomonas fluorescens by means of capillary zone electrophoresis (cze). they form chains and clusters on a different scale, which can be reflected in the electropherograms. a low buffer concentration of tris-borate and na2edta containing a polymeric matrix of 0.0125% poly(ethylene) oxide (peo) was used. key factors were the standardization and optimization of ce conditions, buffer solution, and pretreatment of bacterial samples, which are not transferable to different bacterial strains, in general. the different compositions of the cell wall of on the one hand gram-positive (m. luteus) and gram-negative (n. cinerea)  cocci and on the other hand gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria (p. fluorescens),  are probably responsible for the different pretreatment conditions.

TI  == leap-1, a novel highly disulfide-bonded human peptide, exhibits antimicrobial activity.
AB  == we report the isolation and characterization of a novel human peptide with antimicrobial activity, termed leap-1 (liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide). using a mass spectrometric assay detecting cysteine-rich peptides, a 25-residue peptide containing four disulfide bonds was identified in human blood ultrafiltrate. leap-1 expression was predominantly detected in the liver, and, to a much lower extent, in the heart. in radial diffusion assays, gram-positive bacillus megaterium, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus carnosus, and gram-negative neisseria cinerea as well as the yeast saccharomyces  cerevisiae dose-dependently exhibited sensitivity upon treatment with synthetic leap-1. the discovery of leap-1 extends the known families of mammalian peptides  with antimicrobial activity by its novel disulfide motif and distinct expression  pattern.
