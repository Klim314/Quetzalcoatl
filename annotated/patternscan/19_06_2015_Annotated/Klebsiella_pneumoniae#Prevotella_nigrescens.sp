TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of moxifloxacin against gram-negative enteric rods from colombian patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: gram-negative enteric rods were associated with periodontal diseases  in several populations. the association between enteric and putative periodontal  pathogens has received little attention in the literature. the present investigation determined the occurrence and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates of gram-negative enteric rods from colombian patients with chronic periodontitis. methods: clinical parameters and the in vitro antimicrobial sensitivity of isolates of gram-negative enteric rods were examined in 76 patients with chronic periodontitis in medellin, colombia. subgingival samples were processed using culture and biochemical tests for the detection of periodontal and superinfecting pathogens. selected colonies of gram-negative enteric rods from pure cultures were used to test the susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. chi-square and mann-whitney tests were used to determine differences in clinical variables versus the presence or absence of gram-negative enteric rods. results: klebsiella pneumoniae was found in 12 patients, pseudomonas aeruginosa was found in four patients, and three other species were recovered with a lower prevalence. men (38.75%) tended to harbor more of the studied organisms than women (17.7%) (p = 0.04). gram-negative enteric rods in periodontal pockets correlated positively with the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (respectively, r = 0.66, 0.31, and 0.32; p <0.001). all superinfecting organisms demonstrated a high susceptibility to moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin but exhibited a variable susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. conclusions: this study found high levels of gram-negative enteric rods in  patients with chronic periodontitis. moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin appeared capable of eradicating these organisms from periodontal pockets. its good activity against gram-negative enteric rods and periodontopathogens suggests the  potential use of moxifloxacin as an adjunctive antibiotic in the treatment of mixed periodontal infections.

TI  == changes in the subgingival microbiota and periodontal parameters before and 3 months after bracket placement.
AB  == introduction: dental plaque is organized in a biofilm complex that provides protection and nutrients for periodontopathic bacteria. several factors can affect microbial colonization, including restorations and orthodontic brackets. the aim of this study was to investigate changes in subgingival microbiota and clinical parameters before and after bracket placement. methods: clinical parameters and subgingival microbial samples were collected from 30 patients before and after bracket placement. thirty additional patients with no orthodontic treatment served as controls. samples were cultured and analyzed for  periodontopathic and superinfecting bacteria. a descriptive analysis was conducted, and chi-square, student t, wilcoxon matched, and mann whitney rank sum tests were used to test for differences between groups (p < or=.05). results: no  changes in probing depth or clinical attachment level were observed, but scores for bleeding on probing, plaque index, and gingival index increased after bracket placement (p < or =.05). porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, tannerella forsythia, and fusobacterium species were elevated in the experimental group after bracket placement compared with the control group (p < or =.01). superinfecting microorganisms such as enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, and serratia marcescens were  also found. conclusions: bracket placement influences the accumulation of plaque  and the colonization of important periodontopathic and superinfecting bacteria, resulting in more inflammation and bleeding. special attention should be paid to  oral hygiene methods in orthodontic patients.
