TI  == antimicrobial activity of schinus lentiscifolius (anacardiaceae).
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: schinus lentiscifolius marchand (syn. schinus weinmannifolius engl) is a plant native to rio grande do sul (southern brazil) and has been used in brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. material and methods: the crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, three gram negative bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: candida albicans, candida tropicalis, cryptococcus neoformans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two gram positive bacteria, namely, bacillus cereus, enterococcus spp, and six gram negative bacteria, namely, burkholderia cepacia, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis. results: the leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of schinus lentiscifolius showed a  broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (mic) against the tested bacteria and fungi. the n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against candida albicans (mic=25 mug/ml), candida tropicalis (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and cryptococcus neoformans, (mic=15.5 mug/ml). from the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of schinus lentiscifolius. conclusion: the antimicrobial activity and some constituents of schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. the results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == emergence of bacterial resistance to imipenem and ciprofloxacin in a university hospital.
AB  == we have continuously monitored the in-vitro activities of imipenem and ciprofloxacin against large numbers of non-fastidious clinical isolates. after eight years of use, 97-100% of enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter baumannii remained susceptible to imipenem, but susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa declined from 100% to 91%. after six years of use, 94%-100% of enterobacteriaceae (except providencia stuartii) remained susceptible to ciprofloxacin but susceptibility of p. stuartii, a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa declined from 100%  to 46%, 66% and 84%, respectively. oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were considered to be resistant to imipenem and all beta-lactams. there were no quinolone-resistant staphylococci observed in 1986, but susceptibilities of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus to ciprofloxacin decreased to 85-93% for oxacillin-susceptible strains and to 7-39% for oxacillin-resistant strains. enterococcus faecalis has remained susceptible to imipenem and the modal mic of ciprofloxacin has remained 1 mg/l; however, susceptibility to ciprofloxacin 2 mg/l decreased from 94% to 64%. imipenem-quinolone cross-resistance was observed for staphylococci but not for p. aeruginosa.

TI  == in vitro activity of an oxycephem ocp 9-176 compared with its sulfur analog and other beta-lactams.
AB  == ocp 9-176 is an oxycephem antibiotic that contains a 2-aminothiazolyl, carboxypropyl side chain at c-7 and a pyridinium thiomethyl group at c-3. ocp 9-176 was generally twofold less active than its sulfur-containing analog me 1228 against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, providencia  stuartii, proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens. activity against enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii was equivalent. ocp 9-176 was twofold less active than me-1228 against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter species. activity of the two agents was similar against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. although ocp 9-176 inhibited e. coli containing tem-1 and tem-2, it was less active than me-1228. klebsiella organisms with shv-1 and k-2 beta-lactamases were inhibited, but tem-3-containing isolates had mics of 16  micrograms/ml. ocp 9-176 was minimally hydrolyzed by tem-1, pse-1, k-1, and p99,  and it was a poor inhibitor of p99. replacement of sulfur with oxygen does not increase the activity of compounds with sulfopyridinium methyl groups at c-3.

TI  == comparative in vitro susceptibilities of 504 bacteremic isolates to ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == a total of 504 clinical bacteremic isolates were tested for susceptibility to ticarcillin-clavulanic acid and 12 other antibiotics. ticarcillin-clavulanic acid showed superior antibacterial activity compared to penicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, ticarcillin, gentamicin, and amikacin against bacteremic isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis.  however, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid's activity was inferior to that of vancomycin against methicillin-resistant isolates of s. aureus and s. epidermidis. for escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii, and lactose nonfermenting aerobic gram-negative bacilli, the activity of ticarcillin-clavulanic acid surpassed that of mezlocillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin. of the antimicrobial agents tested, ticarcillin, piperacillin, ceftazidime, and amikacin were the most active antibiotics against  pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new penem, cgp 31608.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cgp 31608, a new penem, against aerobic and anaerobic organisms was evaluated and compared with those of other beta-lactams. cgp 31608  inhibited escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, and salmonella, shigella, aeromonas, and yersinia spp. with mics for 50% of the strains (mic50s) of 2 to 4 micrograms/ml and mic90s of 4 micrograms/ml, compared with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and imipenem mics of less than 0.25 microgram/ml. mic90s were 8 micrograms/ml for enterobacter species and c. freundii, for which other agents had mics of 32 micrograms/ml, except imipenem, which had equal activity. the mic90 for proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia stuartii, and providencia rettgeri was 8 micrograms/ml, compared with less than 2 micrograms/ml shown by the other agents. acinetobacter species resistant to other agents except imipenem were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml, as were pseudomonas aeruginosa, including piperacillin-, ceftazidime-, and gentamicin-resistant isolates. the mic for p. cepacia, p. fluorescens, and p. acidovorans was less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, but that for p. maltophilia was greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. hemolytic streptococci a, b, c, g, and f were inhibited by less than 1 micrograms/ml, but the mic for streptococcus faecalis was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. mics for staphylococcus aureus methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, as were those for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant s. epidermidis. bacteroides fragilis and clostridium species and fusobacterium spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. cgp 31608 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, pse-1, oxa-2, pse-4, or by s. aureus. chromosomal beta-lactamases of type ia in enterobacter cloacae p99 and morganella morganii, ic in p. vulgaris, k-1 in k. oxytoca, and id in p. aeruginosa also did not hydrolyze cgp 31608. it inhibited tem-1, but the 50% inhibitory concentration was 14.2 micrograms/ml compared with 0.15 micrograms/ml for the p99 enzyme. cgp 31608 induced beta-lactamases in p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae, c. freundii and providencia rettgeri, but there was no increase in mics for the isolates and it did not select strains derepressed for beta-lactamase production. synergy of cgp 31608 and gentamicin was found against 90% p. aeruginosa, 60% enterobacter cloacae, and 50% serratia marcescens strains. no synergy was found with rifampin. a postantibiotic effect was found against e. coli.

TI  == in vitro studies on the antibacterial activities of ym-13115, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of ym-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. the compound was highly active against the common members of the enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. ym-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, providencia rettgeri, and providencia stuartii. the activity of ym-13115 against pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. against haemophilus influenzae ym-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. ym-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. the concentrations of ym-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78  and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit streptococcus faecalis. ym-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. ym-13115 is extremely active  against p. aeruginosa and members of the enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == clinical evaluation of temocillin in urinary tract infections.
AB  == a group of 27 female and 2 male urological patients, aged 19 to 80 years (mean 44 years), were treated with intravenous temocillin 500 mg twice daily for 5 to 7 days. the diagnoses were acute pyelonephritis (n = 20), acute cystitis (n = 6), and acute cystitis and pyelonephritis combined (3). the causative organisms were  escherichia coli (n = 20). proteus species (n = 9). klebsiella species (n = 4). streptococcus faecalis (n = 2). staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 1), and providencia stuartii (n = 1). 27 of the 29 patients (93%) were clinically and bacteriologically cured; bacteriuria persisted in 2 patients with prolonged obstructive uropathy. in acute non-obstructive pyelonephritis, the urinary excretion of beta-2-microglobulin rapidly decreased, documenting a prompt renal tubular restitution during therapy. the drug was well tolerated and proved very safe with regard to haematological, hepatic and renal parameters. also, candida haemagglutination titres did not increase significantly during therapy. temocillin therapy should preferably be commenced after the results of the urine  culture are available.

TI  == the susceptibility of nosocomial pathogens to ceftazidime.
AB  == the activities in vitro of ceftazidime and of cefuroxime have been compared against 201 strains of bacteria which had been isolated either from outbreaks of  nosocomial infection or were typical of strains causing such outbreaks. ceftazidime was found to be about 1000 times more active against pseudomonas spp. and proteus vulgaris, and between 10 and 100 times more active against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, proteus rettgeri, proteus morganii, providencia stuartii, alcaligenes faecalis and acinetobacter spp. on the other hand, cefuroxime was more active against staphylococcus epidermidis. an increase in inoculum size to 106 had little effect on the activity of ceftazidime, except in the case of pr. vulgaris strains, which grew, although only to a very limited extent, even in the presence of high concentrations of ceftazidime. anaerobic and hypercapnic conditions did not adversely affect the activity of ceftazidime. our in-vitro results thus indicate  that ceftazidime had as broad a spectrum as gentamicin, and is more intrinsically active.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of five nitrofurans.
AB  == five nitrofurans- nitrofurantoin, nifuratel, nitrofurazone, furazolidone and and  sq 18,506--have been tested against 201 microbial strains. escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, micrococci and staphylococcus epidermidis were sensitive  to all five compounds; furazolidone and sq 18,506 were the most active against these species. klebsiella aerogenes was less sensitive, and proteus spp., providencia stuartii and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were resistant. nifuratel was inhibitory for some candida albicans strains, and sq 18,506 was highly active against this species. nifuratel was judged overall to have superior in vitro antimicrobial properties to nitrofurantoin.
