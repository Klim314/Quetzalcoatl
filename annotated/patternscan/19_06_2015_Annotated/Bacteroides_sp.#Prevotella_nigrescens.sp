TI  == antimicrobial activity of diterpenes from viguiera arenaria against endodontic bacteria.
AB  == six pimarane-type diterpenes isolated from viguiera arenaria baker and two semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro against a panel of representative microorganisms responsible for dental root canal infections. the microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) against porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus faecalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid, its sodium salt and ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol were the most active, displaying mic values ranging from 1 to 10 mug ml-1. the results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new chemicals for use as a complement to instrumental endodontic procedures.

TI  == localized aggressive periodontitis in primary dentition: a case report.
AB  == background: a 5-year-old japanese boy presented with persistent gingival inflammation and severe mobility of the right lower primary incisors. due to severe alveolar bone loss and a deep periodontal pocket (5 mm), the incisors were extracted at the second visit. methods: clinical, radiographic, histological, and microbiological examinations were carried out. then, the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technique was employed to detect specific periodontal pathogens. the chemotactic activity of polymorphonuclear neutrophils was also measured. results: tannerella, capnocytophaga, fusobacterium, and eikenella sp. were recovered from the subgingival microflora around the right lower incisors, while  a. actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus), prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, and capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected using the pcr method. further chemotaxis assay revealed  that neutrophil function was depressed compared with that of healthy controls. conclusions: although inflammation remained around the right primary second molars, the bone loss was controlled by periodic professional mechanical teeth cleaning (pmtc), subgingival irrigation, and local antibiotic application. the probing depths of all teeth, including permanent incisors and molars, were within 2.5 mm.

TI  == treatment of peri-implantitis by local delivery of tetracycline. clinical, microbiological and radiological results.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical, microbiological and radiological effects of peri-implantitis therapy by local delivery of tetracycline. in 25 partially edentulous patients, 30 implants with radiographic  evidence of circumferential bone loss, and peri-implant probing depths > or =5 mm were treated with polymeric tetracycline hcl-containing fibers. clinical and microbial parameters were recorded at baseline, and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months (m) after treatment. standardized radiographs were obtained at baseline, m3, and one  year after treatment. two patients were discontinued from the study after 180 days because of persisting active peri-implantitis with pus formation. the remaining subjects showed a significant decrease of mean peri-implant probing depth from 6.0 to 4.1 mm (m1, p<0.001), which was maintained over 12 months. in comparison to baseline, the bleeding tendency was significantly reduced after one month, and thereafter (p<0.001). no significant recession of the mucosal margin was noted. the radiologically determined distance from the shoulder of the implant to the bottom of the bony defect decreased slightly, but not significantly, from 5.2 to 4.9 mm. at m1, m3 and m6, mean total anaerobic cultivable bacterial counts were significantly lower than at baseline (p<0.001).  a significant decrease in frequency of detection was noted for prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, fusobacterium sp., bacteroides forsythus, and campylobacter rectus (p<0.01). actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and eikenella corrodens had very low baseline frequencies that could not be significantly suppressed further. in conclusion, therapy of peri-implantitis by local delivery of tetracycline had a positive effect on clinical and microbiological parameters.

TI  == biochemical and chemical studies on strains designated prevotella intermedia and  proposal of a new pigmented species, prevotella nigrescens sp. nov.
AB  == a total of 31 strains of prevotella intermedia were subjected to dna-dna hybridization and were characterized by performing physiological tests and by performing a multilocus enzyme analysis, using malate dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase. all of the strains assigned to p. intermedia fermented glucose and sucrose, hydrolyzed starch but not esculin, and produced indole, acetic, isobutyric, isovaleric, and succinic acids as metabolic end products. the results of dna reassociation experiments performed with the reference probe permitted separation of the strains into two well-defined homology groups. in addition, strains with dnas that hybridized with dna from strain atcc 25611t (t = type strain) had high levels of peptidase activity and cleaved lipid substrates (4-methylumbelliferyl laurate and 4-methylumbellifelyl elaidate). multilocus enzyme electrophoresis revealed two electromorphic profiles, one characteristic of strain atcc 25611t and the other characteristic of strain atcc 33563t. we propose that a new species, prevotella nigrescens, should be created for the genetically distinct group of strains that hybridized with strain atcc 33563t. strain atcc 33563 is designated the type strain of p. nigrescens.
