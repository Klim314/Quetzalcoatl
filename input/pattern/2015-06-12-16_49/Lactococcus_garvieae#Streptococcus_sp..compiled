TI  - Isolation and molecular identification of the etiological agents of streptococcosis in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) cultured in net cages in Lake Sentani, Papua, Indonesia.
AB  - Infections with Streptococcus spp. were observed in Nile tilapia cultured in net  cages in Lake Sentani, Papua, Indonesia. Clinical signs included exophthalmia, erratic swimming, ascites in abdominal cavity, and external hemorrhages. Four types of bacterial colonies (SK, K10, P20, and M12) were isolated from the brain, kidney, and eyes. Based on phenotypic and genetic (16S rDNA sequencing) characteristics, the isolates were identified as Streptococcus iniae (SK), Streptococcus agalactiae (K10 and P20) and Lactococcus garvieae (M12). The latter species has not been previously isolated or reported from fish streptococcosis in Indonesia. Intraperitoneal injection of healthy tilapia with the bacterial species caused significant morbidity (70%) within 3 days and 100% mortality at 6 days post injection. Experimental infections and reisolation of the bacteria from morbid and dead fish suggest they are the causative agents of streptococcosis, which rendered high mortality among cage cultured Nile tilapia in Lake Sentani. Our results suggest the need for developing diagnostic tools for accurate identification of the agents of streptococcosis. As tilapia aquaculture continues to expand as a means of food production and livelihood in Indonesia, it becomes crucial to ensure that fish resources are monitored and protected from the adverse effects of infectious diseases.
TI  - Development of real-time PCR for detection and quantitation of Streptococcus parauberis.
AB  - Streptococcus parauberis is an increasing threat to aquaculture of olive flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus Temminck & Schlegel, in South Korea. We developed a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method using the TaqMan probe assay to detect and quantify S. parauberis by targeting the gyrB gene sequences, which are effective for molecular analysis of the genus Streptococcus. Our real-time PCR assay is capable of detecting 10 fg of genomic DNA per reaction. The intra- and interassay coefficient of variation (CV) values ranged from 0.42-1.95%, demonstrating that the assay has good reproducibility. There was not any cross-reactivity to Streptococcus iniae or to other streptococcal/lactococcal fish pathogens, such as S. agalactiae and Lactococcus garvieae, indicating that the assay is highly specific to S. parauberis. The results of the real-time PCR assay corresponded well to those of conventional culture assays for S. parauberis from inoculated tissue homogenates (r = 0.957; P < 0.05). Hence, this sensitive and specific real-time PCR is a valuable tool for diagnostic quantitation of S. parauberis in clinical samples.
TI  - Immunoprotection of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) from Lactococcus garvieae against Lactococcosis in tilapia.
AB  - In this study, the gene encoding 40 kDa GAPDH of L. garvieae was determined and overexpressed by using the Escherichia coli expression system. Analysis results indicated that the sequences of GAPDH of L. garvieae nucleotide and its amino acid are highly homologous (80.4-100%) to several products of GAPDH from L. garvieae and other Streptococcus-related bacteria. According to Western blotting results, rabbit antiserum and tilapia infection serum reacted strongly to the recombinant GAPDH protein. In another experiment, tilapia were immunized intraperitoneally with formalin-killed L. garvieae whole cells, recombinant GAPDH (50 mug fish(-1)) from L. garvieae or both. ISA 763A was used as an adjuvant for vaccine and saline was used as a negative control. The fish challenged at 4 weeks after immunization with GAPDH+WC+ISA had the highest survival rate at 100%, followed by fish immunized with WC+ISA or GAPDH+ISA, which had RPS values of 87.5% and 50%, respectively. Additionally, specific antibody responses against L. garvieae whole cells and GAPDH were based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Following 4 weeks of immunization, the specific antibody level of all vaccine groups significantly increased, except for antibody responses against L. garvieae GAPDH of those immunized with formalin-killed L. garvieae whole cells. Our results further demonstrated that GAPDH from L. garvieae protected tilapia from experimental L. garvieae infection, implying the potential use of L. garvieae GAPDH as a vaccine against L. garvieae.
TI  - Microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of May bryndza cheese.
AB  - Diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of May bryndza cheese, a traditional Slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. Quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and Geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. Diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese, lactobacilli, lactococci and Geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) CFU/g, 10(9) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. The diversity of bacteria encompassed Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Acinetobacter sp., Acinetobacter johnsonii, Citrobacter braakii, Clostridium bartlettii, Corynebacterium callunae, Corynebacterium maris, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus pallens, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Hafnia alvei, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "Leuconostoc garlicum", Mannheimia glucosida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas sp., Ps. fluorescens, "Ps. reactans", Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, "Rothia arfidiae", Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. felis, Staph. pasteuri, Staph. sciuri, Staph. xylosus, Streptococcus parauberis, Str. thermophilus and Variovorax paradoxus. The diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed Alternaria alternata, "Ascomycete sp.", Aspergillus fumigatus, Beauveria brongniartii, Candida xylopsoci, C. inconspicua, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Debaromyces hansenii, Fomes fomentarius, Galactomyces candidus, Gymnoascus reesii, Chaetomium globosum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Metarhizium anisopliae, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, P. camemberti, P. freii, P. polonicum, P. viridicatum, Pichia kudriavzevii, Sordaria alcina, Trichosporon lactis and Yarrowia lipolytica.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria during fermentation of a traditional Chinese fish product, Chouguiyu (stinky mandarinfish).
AB  - Chouguiyu, or stinky mandarinfish, is a traditional Chinese fermented fish product made of mandarinfish by spontaneous fermentation at the anaerobic condition with low-salt concentration. In order to get a primary understanding of the microbial community presenting in the Chouguiyu fermentation, 61 cultures of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from various fermentation period were isolated using MRS agar plates and characterized based on a combination of phenotypic and genotypic approaches including amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) and 16S rRNA partial gene sequencing analysis. Eight distinct bacterial species belonging to 6 genera were identified in total. Among them, Lactobacillus sakei was the dominant species (63%) during the fermentation, which exhibited great variety in phenotypic tests but unique genotypic characters. Meanwhile, the other LAB species including Lactococcus (Lc.) garvieae, Lc. lactis, Lc. raffinolactis, Vagococcus sp., Enterococcus hermanniensis, Macrococcus caseolyticus as well as Streptococcus parauberis were also recovered from the different fermentation periods, especially at the initial point of the fermentation. This seems to be the 1st report investigating the LAB composition involved in Chouguiyu fermentation and the data obtained in this study may be valuable for selecting starter culture for Chouguiyu industrial-scale production.
TI  - Diversity of thermophilic bacteria in raw, pasteurized and selectively-cultured milk, as assessed by culturing, PCR-DGGE and pyrosequencing.
AB  - Thermophilic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) species, such as Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Lactobacillus helveticus, enjoy worldwide economic importance as dairy starters. To assess the diversity of thermophilic bacteria in milk, milk samples were enriched in thermophilic organisms through a stepwise procedure which included pasteurization of milk at 63 degrees C for 30 min (PM samples) and pasteurization followed by incubation at 42 degrees C for 24 h (IPM samples). The microbial composition of these samples was analyzed by culture-dependent (at 42 degrees C) and culture-independent (PCR-DGGE and pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons) microbial techniques. The results were then compared to those obtained for their corresponding starting raw milk counterparts (RM samples). Twenty different species were scored by culturing among 352 isolates purified from the counting plates and identified by molecular methods. Mesophilic LAB species (Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus garvieae) were dominant (87% of the isolates) among the RM samples. However, S. thermophilus and Lb. delbrueckii were found to be the dominant recoverable organisms in both PM and IPM samples. The DGGE profiles of RM and PM samples were found to be very similar; the most prominent bands belonging to Lactococcus, Leuconostoc and Streptococcus species. In contrast, just three DGGE bands were obtained for IPM samples, two of which were assigned to S. thermophilus. The pyrosequencing results scored 95 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 3% sequence divergence in an RM sample, while only 13 were encountered in two IPM samples. This technique identified Leuconostoc citreum as the dominant microorganism in the RM sample, while S. thermophilus constituted more than 98% of the reads in the IPM samples. The procedure followed in this study allowed to estimate the bacterial diversity in milk and afford a suitable strategy for the isolation of new thermophilic LAB strains, among which adequate starters might be selected.
TI  - Assessment of the susceptibility of lactic acid bacteria to biocides.
AB  - Biocides are antimicrobial compounds that are widely used in the food industry and medical environments. In this study, we determined the Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) by the microdilution method of four different biocides for a large collection of LAB of different origins. The tested isolates belong to 11 species of the Lactobacillus genus and to Streptococcus thermophilus, Streptococcus salivarius and Lactococcus garvieae. The results obtained in this study indicate that low susceptibilities to benzalkonium chloride (BC), triclosan (Tr), chlorhexidine (Ch), and sodium hypochlorite (SH) are not frequent among LAB. Moreover, no systematic co-tolerance between two or more tested biocides was found; that is, strains displaying high MIC values and thus low sensitivity to one of the biocides did not show higher MIC values for the other biocides.
TI  - Development of a Reverse Line Blot Hybridization method for Detection of some Streptococcal/Lactococcal Species, the causative agents of Zoonotic Streptococosis/Lactococosis in farmed fish.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Streptococcosis/lactococcosis is the cause of high morbidity and mortality in aquaculture sector and to date a number of species of Streptococcus and Lactococcus genera including S. iniae, S. agalactiae, S. dysagalactiae, S. parauberis, S. feacalis, L. garvieae and L. lactis have been discriminated as the cause of disease in aquatic animals. Despite the use of diagnostic molecular methods for each of these bacterial species, no data is available on a suitable, rapid and simple simultaneous detection tool for these pathogens. This paper describes a simultaneous detection method which is PCR based on a reverse line blot (RLB) for rapid detection and differentiation of four species of genera of Streptococcus and Lactococcus genera consisting of S. iniae, S. agalactiae, S. parauberis and L. garvieae the most important agents of the disease in fish. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A reverse line blot (RLB) assay was developed for the simultaneously identification of four species of Streptococcus/lactococcusconsisting of S. iniae, S. parauberis, S. agalactiaeand Lactococcusgarvieae. The assay employs one set of primer pair for specific amplification of the 16S rRNA gene. These were designed based on the nucleotide sequences of 16S rRNA gene sharing a homology region with Streptococcus spp. and Lactococcus spp. DNA was extracted from the pure bacterial colonies and amplified. A membrane was prepared with specific oligonucleotide for each bacterial species. PCR products were then hybridized to a membrane. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The amplification resulted in PCR product of 241 bp in length. No cross-reactions were observed between any of the tested bacterial species, and mixed DNAs from these four bacterial species were correctly identified. This RLB method is a suitable technique for a simultaneous detection of these species of bacterial fish pathogens that are some of the main causes of streptococcal/lactococcal infections in both freshwater and marine aquatic animals, and so we recommend its use for integrated epidemiological monitoring of streptococcosis/lactococcis in aquaculture industry.
TI  - Simultaneous detection of multiple fish pathogens using a naked-eye readable DNA  microarray.
AB  - We coupled 16S rDNA PCR and DNA hybridization technology to construct a microarray for simultaneous detection and discrimination of eight fish pathogens (Aeromonas hydrophila, Edwardsiella tarda, Flavobacterium columnare, Lactococcus garvieae, Photobacterium damselae, Pseudomonas anguilliseptica, Streptococcus iniae and Vibrio anguillarum) commonly encountered in aquaculture. The array comprised short oligonucleotide probes (30 mer) complementary to the polymorphic regions of 16S rRNA genes for the target pathogens. Targets annealed to the microarray probes were reacted with streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase and nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3'-indolylphosphate, p-toluidine salt (NBT/BCIP), resulting in blue spots that are easily visualized by the naked eye. Testing was performed against a total of 168 bacterial strains, i.e., 26 representative collection strains, 81 isolates of target fish pathogens, and 61 ecologically or phylogenetically related strains. The results showed that each probe consistently identified its corresponding target strain with 100% specificity. The detection limit of the microarray was estimated to be in the range of 1 pg for genomic DNA and 10(3) CFU/mL for pure pathogen cultures. These high specificity and sensitivity results demonstrate the feasibility of using DNA microarrays in the diagnostic detection of fish pathogens.
TI  - The spatial distribution of bacteria in Grana-cheese during ripening.
AB  - The microbial composition and its spatial distribution of Grana Trentino, a hard  Parmesan-like cheese, was determined, from vat milk to cheese. After cutting along the vertical axis of the cheese wheels, three layers were sampled diagonally across the cheese: under the cheese rind, an intermediate section and the cheese core. After two different ripening periods (9 and 18 months), the cheese samples were analysed using traditional culture dependent and culture independent methods. Milk samples were dominated by mesophilic and psychrophilic bacterial counts. Thermophilic bacteria (Lactobacillus helveticus) were found in high amounts in cooked whey and natural whey starter cultures. After 9 months of ripening, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) counts were higher than those after 18 months. Furthermore, the LAB numbers in the cheese core was lower than those under the rind or in the intermediate section. The main LAB species isolated from milk (Lactococcus lactis, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Streptococcus uberis and Lactococcus garvieae) were not found in the corresponding cheeses. Some differences were observed in the species composition among the three cheese sections. Microbiota under the rind and in the intermediate section was similar and dominated by Lactobacillus paracasei and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The core, after 18 months of ripening, was characterized by a total absence of LAB. In each sample, all LAB were genotypically grouped and the different biotypes were subjected to several technological tests indicating that some non-starter LAB (NSLAB) displayed technological features that are favorable for the production of Grana Trentino cheese.
TI  - Chemical synthesis of bacterial lipoteichoic acids: an insight on its biological  significance.
AB  - During infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria, lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin) has a dominant role leading to fulminant pro-inflammatory reactions in the host. As there is no LPS in Gram-positive bacteria, other microbial cell wall components have been identified to be the causative agent for the pro-inflammatory activity since also Gram-positive bacterial infections lead to comparable clinical symptoms and reactions. On search for the "Gram-positive endotoxin" a widely accepted hypothesis has been raised in that the lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) serve as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) during Gram-positive sepsis, although the amount necessary for a pro-inflammatory in vitro response is several orders of magnitude higher than that for LPS. Therefore, LTA cannot be considered to be "the (endo)toxin of Gram-positive bacteria". Although LPS and LTA show structural relatedness (amphiphilic, negatively charged glycophospholipids), they are structurally quite different from each other and one might expect that they are also recognized by different receptors of the innate immune system, the so called toll-like receptors 4 and 2 (TLR4 and TLR2), respectively. Based on their chemical structure, the LTAs were classified into four types (type I-IV) of which we have carefully investigated the LTA of Staphylococcus aureus (type I), Lactococcus garvieae (type II) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (type IV). Hence, these LTAs have been synthesized in our group and biologically evaluated with respect to their potency to activate cytokines in transiently TLR2/CD14-transfected human endothelial kidney cells (HEK 293) or human macrophages and whole blood cells. Although LTA of type I and IV are structurally quite different, especially in their hydrophilic moiety, they originally were believed to interact with the same receptor (TLR2). Hence, the chemical syntheses leading to structurally defined, non-contaminated stimuli have a major impact on the outcome and interpretation of these biological studies of the innate immune system. With this material, it became evident that synthetic LTA from S. aureus and S. pneumoniae are not recognized by TLR2. Instead, another receptor of the innate immune system, the lectin pathway of the complement, known since many years to interact with LTA in quite a specific way, has gained increasing attractivity. With the help of synthetic LTA we obtained first evidences that this receptor is indeed the pathogen recognition receptor (PRR) for LTA.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology of zoonotic streptococcosis/lactococcosis in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) aquaculture in Iran.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Streptococcosis/lactococcosis is a hyperacute systemic disease that can occur in marine and fresh waters of many species of fish. The aim of this work was to study the disease outbreak in the major rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) production of Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 108 Gram positive cocci isolates were obtained from diseased trout in seven provinces with major trout production during 2008 till 2009. These bacterial isolates were characterized using phenotypic and molecular studies. The isolates were also analysed phylogeneticaly and compared with the available data. RESULTS: 49 samples (45.37%) were identified as Streptococcus iniae, 37 samples (35.2%) matched with Lactococcus garvieae; and 22 samples (19.43%) were identified as members of Streptooccus genus by culture-based and biochemical tests of API 50 CH, API 20 STREP and rapid 32 STREP systems. Using universal primers for differentiation of Streptococcus sp. and Enterococcus sp, all 108 samples were identified as Streptococcus sp. with a target region of 500 bp. Single specific PCR resulted in identification of 64 (59.2%) isolates as S. iniae and 44 (40.8%) isolates as L. garvieae. The phylogenetic analysis of the S. iniae isolates resulted in maximal similarity to some strains reported from Taiwan and to all Brazilian strains. Also, one strain showed less sequence similarity values with other tested strains although this strain has high similarity with ATCC 29178 strain, all reported Chinese, and some Taiwanian strains. Also, analysis of S. iniae LctO gene sequence showed that this isolate clustered within the S. iniae group. The sequence analysis of L. garvieae strains also showed that they have maximum similarity to all Japanese and Chinese strains, but one strain has lower sequence similarity values with all other recorded strains. CONCLUSION: [corrected] The results of this study clearly show that trout farming in Iran is severely affected by both species of S. Iniae and L. garvieae and requires serious preventive criteria.
TI  - Streptococcus spp. and related bacteria: their identification and their pathogenic potential for chronic mastitis - a molecular approach.
AB  - Streptococcus spp. and related bacteria form a large group of organisms which are associated with bovine intramammary Infections (IMI). Some of them are the well-known mastitis pathogens Streptococcus uberis and Streptococcus agalactiae. In addition, there are a considerable number of these gram-positive, catalase-negative cocci (PNC) with unclear mastitic pathogenicity such as Aerococcus viridans which make the conventional diagnostics of PNC difficult. One diagnostic, API 20 Strep (API, Biomerieux) is recommended which, as a phenotypic assay, involves a series of miniaturized biochemical tests. Recently, preference is given to genotypic identification methods. In particular, sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene allows highly reproducible and accurate identification of bacteria and permits discovery of novel, clinically relevant bacteria. As a consequence, the aim of the present study was to compare identification of IMI-associated PNC by the API method as well as by sequencing of their 16S rRNA gene (16S). Furthermore, the correlation of these bacteria to bovine chronic mastitis and their phylogeny was investigated. 102 PNC isolated from single quarter milk samples were identified by API and 16S sequencing. Considering Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and Streptococcus agalactiae, both methods generated fully concordant results. In contrast, a very high disconcordance was observed for most of the other PNC, in particular Enterococcus spp., Aerococcus viridans and the viridans streptococci were shown as apathogenic. Lactococcus garvieae was found to be an opportunistic pathogen causing IMI during late lactation. In addition, PNC isolated from milk were frequently observed together with other bacteria, in particular with Staphylococcus spp. In these cases, the levels of somatic cell counts (SCC) were determined by the specific PNC present in the sample. Considering PNC phylogeny based on 16S sequencing, 3 major clusters were observed. They included all the common mastitis pathogens (cluster I), the Lactococcus spp., Enterococcus spp. and Aerococcus spp. (cluster II) and all the viridans streptococci (cluster III).
TI  - Detection of human intestinal catalase-negative, Gram-positive cocci by rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-PCR.
AB  - An analytical system based on rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) for enumeration of catalase-negative, Gram-positive cocci was established. Subgroup- or species-specific primer sets targeting 16S or 23S rRNA from Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Lactococcus were newly developed. The RT-qPCR method using these primers together with the previously reported primer sets specific for the Enterococcus genus, the Streptococcus genus, and several Streptococcus species was found to be able to quantify the target populations with detection limits of 10(3) to 10(4) cells per gram feces, which was more than 100 times as sensitive as the qPCR method (10(6) to 10(8) cells per gram feces). The RT-qPCR analysis of fecal samples from 24 healthy adult volunteers using the genus-specific primer sets revealed that Enterococcus and Streptococcus were present as intestinal commensals at population levels of log(10) 6.2 +/- 1.4 and 7.5 +/- 0.9 per gram feces (mean +/- standard deviation [SD]), respectively. Detailed investigation using species- or subgroup-specific primer sets revealed that the volunteers harbored unique Enterococcus species, including the E. avium subgroup, the E. faecium subgroup, E. faecalis, the E. casseliflavus subgroup, and E. caccae, while the dominant human intestinal Streptococcus species was found to be S. salivarius. Various Lactococcus species, such as L. lactis subsp. lactis or L. lactis subsp. cremoris, L. garvieae, L. piscium, and L. plantarum, were also detected but at a lower population level (log(10) 4.6 +/- 1.2 per gram feces) and prevalence (33%). These results suggest that the RT-qPCR method enables the accurate and sensitive enumeration of human intestinal subdominant but still important populations, such as Gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Analysis of the genome content of Lactococcus garvieae by genomic interspecies microarray hybridization.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactococcus garvieae is a bacterial pathogen that affects different animal species in addition to humans. Despite the widespread distribution and emerging clinical significance of L. garvieae in both veterinary and human medicine, there is almost a complete lack of knowledge about the genetic content of this microorganism. In the present study, the genomic content of L. garvieae CECT 4531 was analysed using bioinformatics tools and microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) experiments. Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis IL1403 and Streptococcus pneumoniae TIGR4 were used as reference microorganisms. RESULTS: The combination and integration of in silico analyses and in vitro CGH experiments, performed in comparison with the reference microorganisms, allowed establishment of an inter-species hybridization framework with a detection threshold based on a sequence similarity of >or= 70%. With this threshold value, 267 genes were identified as having an analogue in L. garvieae, most of which (n = 258) have been documented for the first time in this pathogen. Most of the genes are related to ribosomal, sugar metabolism or energy conversion systems. Some of the identified genes, such as als and mycA, could be involved in the pathogenesis of L. garvieae infections. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we identified 267 genes that were potentially present in L. garvieae CECT 4531. Some of the identified genes could be involved in the pathogenesis of L. garvieae infections. These results provide the first insight into the genome content of L. garvieae.
TI  - Identification of lactic acid bacteria associated with the production of plaa-som, a traditional fermented fish product of Thailand.
AB  - Plaa-som is a Thai fermented fish product for which whole fish or fish fillets are fermented with either cooked rice or steamed sticky rice, salt, and garlic. A total of 762 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated during plaa-som fermentation by culture on CaCO(3)-MRS agar plates. They were screened and grouped by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA), giving six groups that were identified by ribosomal DNA sequencing as Lactococcus garvieae, Streptococcus bovis, Weissella cibaria, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus fermentum. Freshly mixed ingredients contained low populations of LAB (less than 10 CFU/g) that subsequently grew during fermentation to final populations of approximately 10(7)CFU/g. Early stages of the process were dominated by the presence of Lc. garvieae, S. bovis, and W. cibaria. At 48 h into fermentation, W. cibaria, P. pentosaceus, and Lb. plantarum were prevalent, and gave way to a dominance of Lb. plantarum that completed the fermentation. A mixture of these LAB species could be considered as species for development of a starter culture for plaa-som fermentation.
TI  - Diversity and evolution of the microbial populations during manufacture and ripening of Casin, a traditional Spanish, starter-free cheese made from cow's milk.
AB  - Classical culturing and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) techniques have been used for studying the microbial diversity and dynamics of the traditional Spanish Casin cheese during manufacturing and ripening. As with other starter-free cheeses made from raw milk, the microbial diversity of Casin was shown to be high by both culturing and DGGE analyses. The culture technique showed that lactic acid bacteria (LAB) species constituted the majority of the microbial populations. Of the 14 bacterial species identified, Lactococcus garvieae was predominant in the three-day-old cheese sample, although it was replaced by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis at day 30. As expected, the DGGE profiles obtained were complex, consisting, depending on the sample, in five to ten different amplification bands. Among these, a band corresponding to Streptococcus thermophilus was observed throughout the whole manufacturing process. This species had never been identified from traditional Spanish cheeses previously. Culturing and molecular methods showed high populations of undesirable microorganisms, arguing for a required improvement in the hygiene of Casin manufacture. Random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) profiling suggested that the L. garvieae and L. lactis populations were composed of one and five strains, respectively. In addition, only a single L. lactis RAPD pattern was stably maintained from day three to day 30, indicating high succession of strains along ripening. After a thoroughly characterisation, strains of the two Lactococcus species could be used in designing specific starter cultures for Casin. Additional species (such as Lactobacillus plantarum and Corynebacterium variabile) might be included as adjunct cultures.
TI  - Bacterial biodiversity of traditional Zabady fermented milk.
AB  - The aim of this work was to identify the bacterial biodiversity of traditional Zabady fermented milk using PCR-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (PCR-TTGE) and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Most of the identified bacterial species in Zabady samples belonged to lactic acid bacteria (LAB), e.g., Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc citreum, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Lactobacillus johnsonii. Using the culture-dependent and independent methods, the streptococcal and lactococcal groups appeared to be the major bacterial species in Zabady fermented milk, whereas the lactobacilli were the minor ones. The main dominant species was St. thermophilus followed by Lc. garvieae. Other molecular tools, e.g., species-specific PCR assay and cloning and sequencing strategy were used to confirm the TTGE and DGGE results. Lc. garvieae, Lc. raffinolactis, Ln. citreum, and Lb. johnsonii were identified for the first time in this type of Egyptian fermented milk.
TI  - Updating the importance of lactic acid bacteria in fish farming: natural occurrence and probiotic treatments.
AB  - Many recent papers have deepened the state of knowledge about lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in fish gut. In spite of high variability in fish microbiota, LAB are sometimes abundant in the intestine, notably in freshwater fish. Several strains of Streptococcus are pathogenic to fish. Streptococcus iniae and Lactococcus garvieae are major fish pathogens, against which commercial vaccines are available. Fortunately, most LAB are harmless, and some strains have been reported for beneficial effects on fish health. A major step forward in recent years was the converging evidence that LAB can stimulate the immune system in fish. An open question is whether viability can affect immunostimulation. The issue is crucial to commercialize live probiotics rather than inactivated preparations or extracts. There has been a regain of interest in allochthonous strains used as probiotics for terrestrial animals or humans, due to economical and regulatory constraints, but the short survival in sea water may limit application to marine fish. If viability is required, alternative treatments may include the incorporation of prebiotics in feed, and other dietary manipulations that could promote intestinal LAB. Antagonism to pathogens is the other main feature of candidate probiotics, and there are many reports concerning mainly carnobacteria and Enterococcus. Some bacteriocins were characterized which may be of interest not only for aquaculture, but also for food preservation.
TI  - The development of probiotics for the control of multiple bacterial diseases of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum).
AB  - JB-1 and GC2, which were equated with Bacillus sp. and Aeromonas sobria respectively, were recovered from the digestive tract of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss and ghost carp, Cyprinus sp. respectively, and demonstrated effectiveness as probiotics for the control of infections caused by Aeromonas salmonicida, Lactococcus garvieae, Streptococcus iniae, Vibrio anguillarum, Vibrio ordalii and Yersinia ruckeri. When administered to rainbow trout (average weight = 12 g) for 14 days in feed dosed at 2 x 10(8) cells g(-1) of feed, JB-1 led to a reduction in mortalities to 0-13% after challenge with a range of bacterial pathogens compared to 80-100% mortalities of the controls. Similarly, use of GC2 reduced mortalities to 0-16% following the challenge compared to 80-100% mortalities of the controls. The mode of action reflected nutrition, production of inhibitory substances and stimulation of the innate immune responses. Specifically, JB-1 and especially GC2 were positive for siderophore and chitinase production, and increased lysozyme, phagocytic and respiratory burst activity.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with fish and the fish farm environment, established by amplified rRNA gene restriction analysis.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria have become a major source of concern for aquaculture in recent decades. In addition to true pathogenic species of worldwide significance, such as Streptococcus iniae and Lactococcus garvieae, several species have been reported to produce occasional fish mortalities in limited geographic areas, and many unidentifiable or ill-defined isolates are regularly isolated from fish or fish products. To clarify the nature and prevalence of different fish-associated bacteria belonging to the lactic acid bacterium group, a collection of 57 isolates of different origins was studied and compared with a set of 22 type strains, using amplified rRNA gene restriction analysis (ARDRA). Twelve distinct clusters were delineated on the basis of ARDRA profiles and were confirmed by sequencing of sodA and 16S rRNA genes. These clusters included the following: Lactococcus raffinolactis, L. garvieae, Lactococcus l., S. iniae, S. dysgalactiae, S. parauberis, S. agalactiae, Carnobacterium spp., the Enterococcus "faecium" group, a heterogeneous Enterococcus-like cluster comprising indiscernible representatives of Vagococcus fluvialis or the recently recognized V. carniphilus, V. salmoninarum, and Aerococcus spp. Interestingly, the L. lactis and L. raffinolactis clusters appeared to include many commensals of fish, so opportunistic infections caused by these species cannot be disregarded. The significance for fish populations and fish food processing of three or four genetic clusters of uncertain or complex definition, namely, Aerococcus and Enterococcus clusters, should be established more accurately.
TI  - First report of Streptococcus agalactiae and Lactococcus garvieae from a wild bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus).
AB  - The isolation and characterization of two bacterial species, Streptococcus agalactiae and Lactococcus garvieae, previously unreported in wild marine mammals are described from a freshly dead bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, from Kuwait Bay, Kuwait, in September 2001. Conventional and rapid identification systems were used to determine that isolates from muscle and kidney were S. agalactiae and L. garvieae, respectively. The isolates were gram-positive, catalase-negative, oxidase-negative, nonhemolytic cocci. The S. agalactiae was serotyped to group antigen B, whereas the L. garvieae could not be assigned to any serogroup. These Kuwait isolates displayed considerable homogeneity with corresponding American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) type isolates. Although the dolphin S. agalactiae isolate was nonhemolytic, it was biochemically similar to S. agalactiae isolated from mullet sampled in the concurrent Kuwait Bay fish kill. Some biochemical heterogeneity was observed between the dolphin isolates and corresponding mammalian ATCC type isolates, especially with Voges Proskauer, alanine-phenylanaline-proline arylamidase, and alpha-galactosidase tests. Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, experimentally infected with the dolphin S. agalactiae and L. garvieae isolates experienced 90% and 0% mortalities, respectively. This is the first isolation of S. agalactiae and L. garvieae from a wild marine mammal, and the microbial characteristics established here provide pertinent information for the future isolation of these bacteria.
TI  - Partial two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) maps of Streptococcus iniae ATCC29178 and Lactococcus garvieae KG9408.
AB  - To examine the proteomes of 2 important causative agents of fish streptococcosis, Streptococcus iniae ATCC29178 and Lactococcus garvieae KG9408, we used 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) followed by mass spectrometry to generate 2-DE maps of these type strains. Silver-stained 2-DE gels of S. iniae ATCC29178 and L. garvieae KG9408 revealed approximately 320 and 300 spots, respectively, and immobilized pH gradient strips (13 cm, pH 4 to 7) revealed that the majority of the detected spots were concentrated in the pH range of 4.5 to 5.5. The spots were randomly selected from the 2-DE profiles and identified by peptide mass fingerprinting using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry. The majority of the identified proteins were functionally related to energy and carbohydrate metabolism (e.g. enolase ATPase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) or translation and translocation (e.g. elongation factor G, elongation factor Tu, DNA-directed RNA polymerase alpha chain). These data, along with our partial 2-DE maps of S. iniae ATCC29178 and L. garvieae KG9408, may help suggest antigenic proteins for the development of effective diagnostic tools and vaccines against S. iniae and L. garvieae.
TI  - Construction of transposition insertion libraries and specific gene inactivation  in the pathogen Lactococcus garvieae.
AB  - This paper reports the development of genetic tools in Lactococcus garvieae, an important Gram-positive bacterial pathogen affecting both fish and mammals. The vector pGKV210, a broad host range vector, was introduced by electroporation into L. garvieae UNIUD074. The maximal frequency obtained was 3.2 x 10(5) transformants/mug of DNA. Moreover, this effect is highly reproducible and appears to be constant, since all L. garvieae strains tested were transformed. Once the optimal transformation procedure was established, it was used to generate isogenic and transposition mutants. Insertional mutagenesis of the L. garvieae SA9H10L gene, similar to a Streptococcus pyogenes gene encoding the M protein (emm64), was carried out using the conditional replication plasmid pORI19. Transposition mutagenesis using the streptococcal temperature-sensitive suicide vector pTV408 to deliver Tn917 into the chromosome of L. garvieae was also achieved at a frequency of ca. 10(-4). Transposon flanking DNA sequences were obtained by plasmid rescue in Escherichia coli and their sequencing analysis demonstrated that the transposon was inserted at different chromosomal loci. Tn917 also made it possible to select a mutant in the operon involved in mannitol fermentation in this microorganism. The results obtained in the present study lay the foundation for future research on the virulence mechanisms of L. garvieae.
TI  - PCR amplification of species specific sequences of 16S rDNA and 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region for identification of Streptococcus phocae.
AB  - Streptococcus phocae, a bacterial pathogen of seals, could reliably be identified by PCR amplification using oligonucleotide primers designed according to species specific segments of the previously sequenced 16S rRNA gene and the 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region of this species. The PCR mediated assay allowed an identification of S. phocae isolated from harbor and gray seals and from Atlantic salmons. No cross-reaction could be observed with 13 different other streptococcal species and subspecies and with Lactococcus garvieae strains investigated for control purposes.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of Streptococcus sp. from diseased flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) in Jeju Island.
AB  - Streptococcus sp. is gram-positive coccus that causes streptococcal infections in fish due to intensification of aquaculture and caused significant economic losses in fish farm industry. A streptococcal infection occurred from cultured diseased olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) in May, 2005 at a fish farm in Jeju Island, Korea. The diseased flounder exhibited bilateral exophthalmic eyes and rotten gills; water temperature was 16-18 degrees C when samples were collected. Of the 22 fish samples collected, 3 samples were identified as Lactococcus garvieae and 18 samples were identified as Streptococcus parauberis by culture-based, biochemical test. Serological methods such as slide agglutination, hemolysis and antimicrobial susceptibility test were also used as well as multiplex PCR-based method to simultaneously detect and confirm the pathogens involved in the infection. S. parauberis and L. garvieae have a target region of 700 and 1100 bp., respectively. One fish sample was not identified because of the difference in the different biochemical and serological tests and was negative in PCR assay. In the present study, it showed that S. parauberis was the dominant species that caused streptococcosis in the cultured diseased flounder.
TI  - Use of a probiotic to control lactococcosis and streptococcosis in rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum).
AB  - From a comparison of 125 bacterial isolates recovered from the digestive tract of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, and carp, Cyprinus sp., a culture was obtained which was effective at preventing clinical disease caused by Lactococcus garvieae and Streptococcus iniae when used as a feed additive. The culture, Aeromonas sobria GC2, was incorporated into the feed and fed to rainbow trout (average weight = 20 g) for 14 days at a dose equivalent to 5 x 10(7) cells g(-1) of feed. Whereas the untreated controls experienced losses of 75-100% when challenged intraperitoneally with L. garvieae and S. iniae, the probiotic-treated groups remained healthy with total mortalities of only 0-6%. Formalized and sonicated preparations of GC2 and cell-free supernatant fared less well. The mode of action reflected stimulation of innate immunity, namely an increased number of leucocytes and enhanced phagocytic and respiratory burst activity.
TI  - Biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria in Moroccan soft white cheese (Jben).
AB  - The bacterial diversity occurring in traditional Moroccan soft white cheese, produced in eight different regions in Morocco, was studied. A total of 164 lactic acid bacteria were isolated, purified and identified by whole-cell protein fingerprinting and rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting. The majority of the strains belonged to the genera Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc and Enterococcus. Sixteen species were identified: Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus buchneri, Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus garvieae, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc citreum, Eterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus saccharominimus and Streptococcus sp.
TI  - Lancefield group C Streptococcus dysgalactiae infection responsible for fish mortalities in Japan.
AB  - A Lancefield serological group C Streptococcus sp. was isolated from cultured amberjack, Seriola dumerili Risso, and yellowtail, Seriola quinqueradiata Temminck and Schlegel, immunized with Lactococcus garvieae commercial vaccines in Japan. The isolated bacteria were Gram-positive cocci, auto-aggregating in saline, morphologically long chains in growth medium, catalase negative and alpha-haemolytic on blood agar. An almost complete gene sequence of the 16S rDNA of two isolates was determined and compared with that of bacterial strains in the database. The isolates were identified as Streptococcus dysgalactiae based on the results of the 16S rDNA sequence, the bacteriological properties and the Lancefield serological grouping. Oligonucleotide primers specifically designed for the 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region of S. dysgalactiae amplified a gene from all the fish isolates, as well as the type strains alpha-haemolytic S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae ATCC430738 and beta-haemolytic S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis ATCC35666, but not those of S. equi ATCC33398, Lactococcus garvieae ATCC43921 and L. garvieae KG9408. The severe necrotic lesions of the caudal peduncle seen in experimentally infected fish were similar to those seen in naturally infected fish.
TI  - Multiplex PCR assay for detection of bacterial pathogens associated with warm-water Streptococcosis in fish.
AB  - A multiplex PCR-based method was designed for the simultaneous detection of the main pathogens involved in warm-water streptococcosis in fish (Streptococcus iniae, Streptococcus difficilis, Streptococcus parauberis, and Lactococcus garvieae). Each of the four pairs of oligonucleotide primers exclusively amplified the targeted gene of the specific microorganism. The sensitivity of the multiplex PCR using purified DNA was 25 pg for S. iniae, 12.5 pg for S. difficilis, 50 pg for S. parauberis, and 30 pg for L. garvieae. The multiplex PCR assay was useful for the specific detection of the four species of bacteria not only in pure culture but also in inoculated fish tissue homogenates and naturally infected fish. Therefore, this method could be a useful alternative to the culture-based method for the routine diagnosis of warm-water streptococcal infections in fish.
TI  - Lactococcus garvieae in wild Red Sea wrasse Coris aygula (Labridae).
AB  - Lactococcus garvieae infection in wild wrasse Coris aygula is reported, and the serological and molecular characteristics of the isolate are described. This is the first evidence of the presence of this pathogen in the Red Sea, and it follows the recent diagnosis of Mycobacterium marinum and Streptococcus iniae in wild fish from the same region. Whether all 3 pathogens are strains endemic to the Red Sea, or recent introductions into the region, remains to be determined, but their appearance over a period of a few years in wild fish populations in the northern Red Sea is consistent with an emerging trend affecting marine organisms on a global level in areas subjected to intense anthropogenic impacts.
TI  - Streptococcus iniae expresses a cell surface non-immune trout immunoglobulin-binding factor when grown in normal trout serum.
AB  - Three capsulated isolates of S. iniae representing serotype I and II and being arginine dihydrolase positive, negative or variable (AD+ve, AD-ve, AD+-ve) were investigated for their ability to bind rainbow trout serum immunoglobulin by the Fc region. Using a coagglutination assay with bacteria grown in Todd-Hewitt broth (THB), no evidence of non-specific Fc-binding of trout immunoglobulin (Ig) was obtained. However, when grown in normal trout serum, all isolates produced similar protein patterns in SDS-PAGE, but they were markedly different from the patterns of the bacteria grown in THB. Some bands with MW 70 kDa and over 100 kDa were very intense in the profiles of the serum-grown isolates. In Western blots, these bands of all isolates were immunostained with the conjugated goat antiserum to trout Ig, after blocking with normal goat serum, demonstrating that the bacteria had bound the trout Ig during growth in the serum. When the isolates were grown overnight in trout antiserum against Lactococcus garvieae they coagglutinated with L. garvieae cells but S. iniae isolates grown in normal trout serum did not. These data indicate that S. iniae grown in serum express surface factors which can bind trout Ig by the Fc-region.
TI  - 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region polymorphism of Lactococcus garvieae, Lactococcus raffinolactis and Lactococcus lactis as revealed by PCR and nucleotide sequence analysis.
AB  - The intergenic spacer region (ISR) between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes was tested  as a tool for differentiating lactococci commonly isolated in a dairy environment. 17 reference strains, representing 11 different species belonging to the genera Lactococcus, Streptococcus, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus and Leuconostoc, and 127 wild streptococcal strains isolated during the whole fermentation process of "Fior di Latte" cheese were analyzed. After 16S-23S rDNA ISR amplification by PCR, species or genus-specific patterns were obtained for most of the reference strains tested. Moreover, results obtained after nucleotide analysis show that the 16S-23S rDNA ISR sequences vary greatly, in size and sequence, among Lactococcus garvieae, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Lactococcus lactis as well as other streptococci from dairy environments. Because of the high degree of inter-specific polymorphism observed, 16S-23S rDNA ISR can be considered a good potential target for selecting species-specific molecular assays, such as PCR primer or probes, for a rapid and extremely reliable differentiation of dairy lactococcal isolates.
TI  - Identification of Enterococcus species and phenotypically similar Lactococcus and Vagococcus species by reverse checkerboard hybridization to chaperonin 60 gene sequences.
AB  - Data from four recent studies (S. H. Goh et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 36:2164-2166, 1998; S. H. Goh et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 34:818-823, 1996; S. H. Goh et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 35:3116-3121, 1997; A. Y. C. Kwok et al., Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 49:1181-1192, 1999) suggest that an approximately 600-bp region of the chaperonin 60 (Cpn60) gene, amplified by PCR with a single pair of degenerate primers, has utility as a potentially universal target for bacterial identification (ID). This Cpn60 gene ID method correctly identified isolates representative of numerous staphylococcal species and Streptococcus iniae, a human and animal pathogen. We report herein that this method enabled us to distinguish clearly between 17 Enterococcus species (Enterococcus asini, Enterococcus rattus, Enterococcus dispar, Enterococcus gallinarum, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus cecorum, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus mundtii, Enterococcus casseliflavus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus malodoratus, Enterococcus raffinosus, Enterococcus avium, Enterococcus pseudoavium, Enterococcus new sp. strain Facklam, and Enterococcus saccharolyticus), and Vagococcus fluvialis, Lactococcus lactis, and Lactococcus garvieae. From 123 blind-tested samples, only two discrepancies were observed between the Facklam and Collins phenotyping method (R. R. Facklam and M. D. Collins, J. Clin. Microbiol. 27:731-734, 1989) and the Cpn60 ID method. In each case, the discrepancies were resolved in favor of the Cpn60 ID method. The species distributions of the 123 blind-tested isolates were Enterococcus new sp. strain Facklam (ATCC 700913), 3; E. asini, 1; E. rattus, 4; E. dispar, 2; E. gallinarum, 20; E. hirae, 9; E. durans, 9; E. faecalis, 12; E. mundtii, 3; E. casseliflavus, 8; E. faecium, 25; E. malodoratus, 3; E. raffinosus, 8; E. avium, 4; E. pseudoavium, 1; an unknown Enterococcus clinical isolate, sp. strain R871; Vagococcus fluvialis, 4; Lactococcus garvieae, 3; Lactococcus lactis, 3; Leuconostoc sp., 1; and Pediococcus sp., 1. The Cpn60 gene ID method, coupled with reverse checkerboard hybridization, is an effective method for the identification of Enterococcus and related organisms.
TI  - Identification of aesculin-hydrolyzing streptococci, lactococci, aerococci and enterococci from subclinical intramammary infections in dairy cows.
AB  - Aesculin-hydrolyzing, catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci isolated from subclinical intramammary infections in dairy cows were identified to species level using growth characteristics and biochemical activity. The results indicated that the aesculin-hydrolyzing cocci associated with this type of infection are a very heterogenic group. S. uberis strains, including inulin- or beta-glucuronidase-negative isolates, accounted for only about one-third of the collection, and Enterococcus faecalis strains for one-fifth. Other species of some importance included (in descending order of isolation frequency) Aerococcus viridans, Streptococcus pluranimalium, Lactococcus garvieae, Streptococcus bovis and Streptococcus gallolyticus.
TI  - Identification of genes in a KG- phenotype of Lactococcus garvieae, a fish pathogenic bacterium, whose proteins react with antiKG- rabbit serum.
AB  - Five different clones (SA1B05, SA1B10, SA2F01, SA8A11 and SA9H10) were isolated from the gene library of the Lactococcus garvieae SA8201 (KG-) strain by immunological screening using rabbit serum against L. garvieae (KG-) phenotype cells. A Western blot analysis indicated that the molecular sizes of immunologically detected proteins of SA1B05, SA1B10, SA2F01, SA8A11 and SA9H10, which were fused with LacZ protein, were 25, 30, 28, 26 and 13 kDa, respectively. The amino acid sequences of the immunologically detected proteins of SA1B05, SA1B10, SA2F01 and SA8A11 were homologous to a processing protease of Bacillus subtilis (36.6%), dihydropteroate synthase of Escherichia coli (34.6%), trigger factor of B. subtilis (45.8%) and N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate deacetylase of Vibrio furnissii (37.1%), respectively. There was no significant homologous sequence of SA9H10 in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank and SwissProt. We cloned and sequenced a longer DNA fragment (SA9H10L) of SA9H10 from the gene library. The predicted amino acid sequence of this clone was weak homology to M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes (22.7%). Five genes were specifically expressed in the KG- phenotype strains. However, SA8A11 and SA9H10 was expressed in the mutated strain SA8201-TTC, whose serological phenotype was changed from KG- to KG+ by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride.
TI  - Lactococcus garvieae and Streptococcus iniae infections in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss: similar, but different diseases.
AB  - Clinical and macroscopic findings (anorexia, lethargy, loss of orientation and exophthalmia) indicate that Streptococcus iniae and Lactococcus garvieae infections of trout share some common features, but histopathology reveals notable differences between the 2 diseases. Meningitis and panophthalmitis are the main lesions among S. iniae infected trout, whereas L. garvieae infection results in a hyperacute systemic disease. Differences in the LD50s of the 2 pathogens and the sudden onset of signs and death correlate with the histopathological findings, indicating the severity of L. garvieae infection of trout.
TI  - Identification of Lactococcus garvieae by PCR.
AB  - Lactococcus garvieae junior synonym Enterococcus seriolicida) is an emerging zoonotic agent isolated from economically important fish (rainbow trout and yellowtail), from cattle, and from humans. Clindamycin susceptibility is the only phenotypic test which can differentiate L. garvieae from Lactococcus lactis, another emerging agent in humans. A PCR assay for the identification of L. garvieae was developed and resulted in an amplified fragment of 1,100 bp in size. The PCR assay was shown to be specific to L. garvieae. The PCR assay was positive for all the L. garvieae strains tested, which originated from three different continents (Asia, Australia, and Europe). The PCR assay was negative for the phenotypically similar L. lactis and for all the other fish pathogens tested, including Streptococcus iniae and Aeromonas salmonicida. The PCR assay was applied to plasma obtained from diseased animals and was found sensitive enough to detect bacteria from 1 microl of plasma. The PCR assay that was developed is the only practical test besides the clindamycin test which can specifically identify the zoonotic agent L. garvieae and which can differentiate it from L. lactis.
TI  - Immunization with bacterial antigens: infections with streptococci and related organisms.
AB  - Streptococcal infections of fish have been reported from various parts of the world, including the Far East, the United States, South Africa, Australia, Israel and Europe. Classification of Gram-positive cocci (DNA-DNA hybridization studies coupled with 165 sequencing) has shown that at least five different defined species are pathogenic to fish, e.g. Streptococcus iniae (syn. S. shilot), Streptococcus difficile, Lactococcus garvieae (syn. Enterococcus seriolicida), Lactococcus piscium and Vagococcus salmoninarum. "Streptococcosis" of fish should therefore be regarded as a complex of similar diseases caused by different genera and species of Gram-positive cocci, each capable of inducing CNS damage, as well as various degrees of multisystem organ involvement. Panophthalmitis ("pop-eye") and meningitis/meningoencephalitis are the sole findings in trout infected by S. iniae and in tilapines infected by S. difficile. In contrast, L. garvieae-infected trout bear a systemic hyperacute infection with diffuse haemorrhages. Therapeutic measures are generally ineffective. Development of vaccines is therefore essential to control these diseases. In our studies, trout were vaccinated intraperitoneally with whole-cell formalin-inactivated S. iniae and L. garvieae and tilapines with whole-cell formalin-inactivated and acellular S. difficile extract. Under laboratory conditions, S. difficile-vaccinated tilapines were protected against a challenge of 100 LD50s. Protection was correlated with the development of specific agglutinins. Western blot analysis supported the hypothesis that only a few proteins act as protective antigens. S. iniae autovaccines were effective in preventing the disease in rainbow trout in Israel. Under field conditions, fish vaccinated at 50 g were protected for over four months. The qualitative analysis of the humoral response indicated that specific antibodies are directed against a few protein moieties. The fact that passive transfer of antibodies protected fish from experimental infection suggests that the basic mechanism of protection is antibody mediated. L. garvieae autovaccines developed for Italian trout farming were found to elicit a response similar to that of S. iniae. Despite the high virulence of L. garvieae (LD50 of 6 x 10(1) CFU/fish, compared with 3 x 10(4) CFU/fish of S. iniae), the protection against the experimentally induced disease lasted for five months under laboratory conditions, with survival rates of 80-90%. A single injection of the vaccine (0.1 ml/fish) resulted in specific antibody production detectable for six months. In the field, protection rates of 70-80% were obtained for a period of three months, in fish of 200-300 g reared at water temperatures of 18-21 degrees C.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibilities of Lactococcus lactis and Lactococcus garvieae and a proposed method to discriminate between them.
AB  - The MICs of antimicrobial agents contained in the SCEPTOR Streptococcus MIC panels (Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems) were determined for Lactococcus lactis, L. garvieae, and unknown Lactococcus species. Several isolates had reduced susceptibilities to many of the antimicrobial agents contained in the panel. For L. garvieae, the MICs of penicillin and, possibly, cephalothin were higher than for L. lactis, and unlike L. lactis, L. garvieae was resistant to clindamycin, indicating that knowledge of the Lactococcus species causing an infection might influence the choice of antimicrobial therapy. Susceptibility to clindamycin can also be used to differentiate between L. lactis and L. garvieae.
