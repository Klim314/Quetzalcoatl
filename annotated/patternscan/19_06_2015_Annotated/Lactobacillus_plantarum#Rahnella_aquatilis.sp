TI  == effects of ensiling fermentation and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community in italian ryegrass, guinea grass, and whole-crop maize silages stored  at high moisture content.
AB  == the effects of storage period and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community were examined in italian ryegrass (ir), guinea grass (gg), and whole-crop maize (wm) silages. direct-cut forages were stored in a laboratory silo for 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 120 d without any additives; live counts, content  of fermentation products, and characteristics of the bacterial community were determined. 2,3-butanediol, acetic acid, and lactic acid were the dominant fermentation products in the ir, gg, and wm silages, respectively. the acetic acid content increased as a result of prolonged ensiling, regardless of the type  of silage crop, and the changes were distinctively visible from the beginning of  gg ensiling. pantoea agglomerans, rahnella aquatilis, and enterobacter sp. were the major bacteria in the ir silage, indicating that alcoholic fermentation may be due to the activity of enterobacteria. staphylococcus sciuri and bacillus pumilus were detected when ir silage was spoiled, whereas between aerobically stable and unstable silages, no differences were seen in the bacterial community  at silo opening. lactococcus lactis was a representative bacterium, although acetic acid was the major fermentation product in the gg silage. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and morganella morganii were suggested to be associated with the increase in acetic acid due to prolonged storage. enterobacter cloacae appeared when the gg silage was spoiled. in the wm silage, no distinctive changes due to prolonged ensiling were seen in the bacterial community. throughout the ensiling, weissella paramesenteroides, weissella confusa, and klebsiella pneumoniae were present in addition to l. plantarum, l. brevis, and l. lactis. upon deterioration, acetobacter pasteurianus, klebsiella variicola, enterobacter hormaechei, and bacillus gibsonii were detected. these results demonstrate the diverse bacterial community that evolves during ensiling  and aerobic spoilage of ir, gg, and wm silages.

TI  == changes in the bacterial community and composition of fermentation products during ensiling of wilted italian ryegrass and wilted guinea grass silages.
AB  == to gain further insights into temperate and tropical grass ensiling, fermentation products and bacterial communities were examined at both the initial and late stages of ensiling of wilted italian ryegrass and wilted guinea grass silages. 2,3-butanediol and ethanol fermentation were observed in wilted italian ryegrass  silage. enterobacteria such as rahnella sp. and enterobacter sp. may have been involved in fermentation; however, alcohol production was intensified after the silage enterobacterial community overwhelmed the pre-ensiled enterobacterial community. pediococcus spp. appeared in silage stored for 4 months, when a significant increase in lactic acid content was seen compared with that at 2 months. prolonged storage enhanced acetic acid fermentation in wilted guinea grass silage. the disappearance of enterococcus sulfureus and appearance of lactobacillus plantarum may have been associated with the increased acetic acid content. although many species of enterobacteria were found in common between the pre-ensiled crop and silages of italian ryegrass and guinea grass, marked differences were seen in the type of fermentation from the initial stages. these  results indicate that the bacterial community of pre-ensiled crops may be immediately replaced by one that is adapted to ensiling environments, although metabolic changes may continue over the course of ensiling.

TI  == monitoring the bacterial community of maize silage stored in a bunker silo inoculated with enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus buchneri.
AB  == aims: to monitor variations in the bacterial community and fermentation products  of maize silage within and between bunker silos. methods and results: silage samples were collected in 2008 and 2009 from three dairy farms, wherein the farmers arranged for a contractor to produce maize silage using bunker silos. silage was prepared using a lactic acid bacteria (lab) inoculant consisting of enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus buchneri. eight samples were collected from each bunker silo; 4 'outer' and 4 'inner' samples were collected from near the top and the bottom of the silo. the dry matter, lactic acid, acetic acid, ethanol, 1-propanol and 1,2-propanediol contents differed between bunker silos in both sampling years. higher acetic acid, 1-propanol and 1,2-propanediol contents were found in the bottom than the top layers in the 2008 samples, and higher lactic acid content was found in the top than the bottom layers in the 2009 samples. the bacterial community varied more between bunker silos than within a bunker silo in the 2008 samples, whereas differences between the top and the bottom layers were seen across bunker silos in the 2009 samples. the inoculated lab were uniformly distributed, while several nonconventional silage bacteria were also detected. lactobacillus acetotolerans,  lactobacillus panis and acetobacter pasteurianus were detected in both years. stenotrophomonas maltophilia was detected in the 2008 samples, and lactobacillus  reuteri, acinetobacter sp. and rahnella sp. were detected in the 2009 samples. conclusions: although differences were seen within and between bunker silos, the  bacterial community may indicate a different relationship between bunker silos and sampling locations within a bunker silo from that indicated by the fermentation products. significance and impact of the study: analysis of bacterial community can help understand how diverse non-lab and lab species are involved in the ensiling process of bunker-made maize silage.
