TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of sch 27899, oligosaccharide member of the everninomycin  class with a wide gram-positive spectrum.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of sch 27899 (everninomycin), a novel oligosaccharide compound of the everninomycin class, was compared with vancomycin, chloramphenicol, clinafloxacin, teicoplanin and doxycycline against 428 clinical strains of bacteria. everninomycin base exhibited the greatest antimicrobial activity compared to other formulations against all strains tested  (mic90: 0.25 microg/ml) followed by clinafloxacin and teicoplanin (mic90: 0.5 microg/ml), vancomycin (mic90: 2 microg/ml), and doxycycline (mic90: 16 microg/ml). everninomycin demonstrated the best activity against streptococcus spp. (serogroups a, b, c, f, g) and streptococcus pneumoniae, and lower activity  against coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic90: 0.5 microg/ml). all enterococci  had an everninomycin mic of 0.5 microg/ml or less. everninomycin had no measurable antimicrobial activity against gram-negative aerobic organisms except  flavobacterium meningosepticum (mic50: 2 microg/ml). some everninomycin activity  was observed against clostridium spp., peptostreptococcus spp., and the prevotella bivius-disiens group. everninomycin showed excellent activity (mic90:  0.25 microg/ml) against the fluoroquinolone-resistant strains and all gram-positive strains resistant to vancomycin (mics less-than-or-equal 4 microg/ml). the mbc/mic ratios and killing curve data suggest that everninomycin  is not uniformly or rapidly bactericidal. these in vitro data indicate that everninomycin could be useful against emerging gram-positive strains resistant to other contemporary antimicrobials.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, fk037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between january 1992 and june 1993. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), bacteroides fragilis and prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for enterococcus faecalis. fk037 was superior in potency  to ceftazidime against all strains except e. faecalis, p. anaerobius and p. bivia. it was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and p. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. fk037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against mrsa, s. agalactiae and e. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except g. vaginalis and b. fragilis that were  4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to fk037.

TI  == anaerobes and septic abortion.
AB  == the bacterial flora of the genital tracts of twenty-two patients with septic abortion and twenty normal women (as controls) were studied to determine the significant aetiological agents. the predominant flora qualitatively and quantitatively in the twenty-two patients were anaerobes. bacteroides bivius was  isolated from all the twenty-two patients and from twelve out of twenty normal controls. the next commonest anaerobes were b. asaccharolyticus (fourteen out of  twenty-two patients), b. melaninogenicus (ten out of twenty-two), b. fragilis (eleven out of twenty-two), b. disiens (eight out of twenty-two) and anaerobic cocci (six out of twenty-two); they were also isolated from nine out of twenty, twelve, zero, eight and three control subjects respectively. the commonest facultative bacteria isolated from both the patients and afebrile controls were escherichia coli, klebsiella aerogenes and streptococcus faecalis. the comparative increase in number of patients colonized by the anaerobes and the increase in the bacteria, by quantitative assessment in the patient group, signify the importance of anaerobes in septic abortion.
