TI  == further studies on a human intestinal bacterium ruminococcus sp. end-1 for transformation of plant lignans to mammalian lignans.
AB  == a human intestinal bacterium ruminococcus (r.) sp. end-1 capable of oxidizing (-)-enterodiol to (-)-enterolactone, enantioselectively, was further investigated from the perspective of transformation of plant lignans to mammalian lignans; a cell-free extract of the bacterium transformed (-)-enterodiol to (-)-enterolactone through an intermediate, enterolactol. the bacterium showed not only oxidation but also demethylation and deglucosylation activities for plant lignans. arctiin and secoisolariciresinol diglucoside were converted to (-)-dihydroxyenterolactone and (+)-dihydroxyenterodiol, respectively. moreover, by coincubation with eggerthella sp. sdg-2, the bacterium transformed arctiin and secoisolariciresinol diglucoside to (-)-enterolactone and (+)-enterodiol, respectively.
