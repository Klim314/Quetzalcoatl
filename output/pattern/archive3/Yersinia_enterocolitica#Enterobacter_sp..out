visual identification of bacterially contaminated red cells.
there have been increasing numbers of reports of transfusion-acquired yersinia enterocolitica bacteremia (including several fatal cases). fifteen units of whole blood were inoculated with various concentrations of y. enterocolitica serotype 0:3 and processed into as-3 preserved red cells (rbcs). consistent growth of the organism was found at inoculum concentrations greater than or equal to 10 colony-forming units per ml. in all 13 units of rbcs that supported the growth of y. enterocolitica, a darkening in color (due to hemolysis and a decrease in po2) was observed in the bag. the attached sample segments, which were sealed from the main unit, remained sterile and did not darken. this color change was apparent in all the contaminated units by day 35, which was 1.5 to 2 weeks after the bacteria were first detected in cultures of the blood. hence, by comparison of the color of the segment tubing with that of the unit itself, units grossly contaminated with y. enterocolitica can be identified prior to transfusion. moreover, review of photographs on file at the centers for disease control revealed this dramatic color change in 2 units of blood that caused transfusion-transmitted sepsis (enterobacter agglomerans and an unidentified gram-negative bacillus, not yersinia sp.), which demonstrated that the color change was not limited to y. enterocolitica. this method of visual identification of contaminated units of blood could decrease the incidence of posttransfusion bacterial sepsis.
in-vitro activity of ofloxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid compared to other quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
ofloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound. its activity against 900 bacterial isolates was determined. it inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., aeromonas hydrophila, salmonella spp., shigella spp., citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, yersinia enterocolitica at less than or equal to 0.8 mg/l. branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus sp., neisseria sp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l. pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pseudomonas species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 mg/l. although most staphylococcal species, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci were inhibited by 3.1 mg/l, many streptococcal species had higher mic values, and most bacteroides species were inhibited at less than or equal to 6.3 mg/l. the overall activity of ofloxacin was similar to enoxacin and norfloxacin. ofloxacin inhibited organisms resistant to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, cephalexin, piperacillin, and gentamicin including enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime. the activity of ofloxacin was lower at an acid ph and in urine, but serum had no effect on mics or mbcs. increase in ofloxacin mics for various bacteria could be achieved by repeated subculture in the presence of ofloxacin.
