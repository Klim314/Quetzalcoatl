TI  == immunomodulatory properties of streptococcus and veillonella isolates from the human small intestine microbiota.
AB  == the human small intestine is a key site for interactions between the intestinal microbiota and the mucosal immune system. here we investigated the immunomodulatory properties of representative species of commonly dominant small-intestinal microbial communities, including six streptococcal strains (four streptococcus salivarius, one s. equinus, one s. parasanguinis) one veillonella parvula strain, one enterococcus gallinarum strain, and lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1 as a bench mark strain on human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. the different streptococci induced varying levels of the cytokines il-8, tnf-alpha, and il-12p70, while the v. parvula strain showed a strong capacity to induce il-6. e. gallinarum strain was a potent inducer of cytokines and tlr2/6 signalling. as streptococcus and veillonella can potentially interact metabolically and frequently co-occur in ecosystems, immunomodulation by pair-wise combinations of strains were also tested for their combined immunomodulatory properties. strain combinations induced cytokine responses in dendritic cells that differed from what might be expected on the basis of the results obtained with the individual strains. a combination of (some) streptococci with veillonella appeared to negate il-12p70 production, while augmenting il-8, il-6, il-10, and tnf-alpha responses. this suggests that immunomodulation data obtained in vitro with individual strains are unlikely to adequately represent immune responses to mixtures of gut microbiota communities in vivo. nevertheless, analysing the immune responses of strains representing the dominant species in the intestine may help to identify immunomodulatory mechanisms that influence immune homeostasis.

TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == association of streptococcus pluranimalium with valvular endocarditis and septicaemia in adult broiler parents.
AB  == the genus streptococcus consists of more than 60 species, but only streptococcus  equi subspecies zooepidemicus, streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus, streptococcus gallinaceus, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus suis have been isolated from poultry. during investigations of the  aetiology of increased mortality in broiler parent stock at the end of production, pure cultures of streptococcal-like organisms that could not be classified among these six species were obtained from 24 cases of septicaemia or  valvular endocarditis and septicaemia. phenotypic characterization using the api20 strep kit identified the isolates as aerococcus viridans (10), aerococcus urinae (2), leuconostoc species (4), streptococcus salivarius (2), streptococcus  bovis ii 3 (1), enterococcus avium (3), enterococcus faecium (1) or gemella morbillorum (1). however, this identification was misleading as subsequent genetic investigations using pulse field gel electrophoresis and sequencing of 16s rrna genes showed that 19 isolates were classified as streptococcus pluranimalium, while the remaining isolates were e. avium (3), e. faecium (1) or  lactobacillus species (1). misidentification by api20 strep was related to the database provided by the manufacturer, as the phenotypic characteristics could identify these organisms as s. pluranimalium. the isolates of s. pluranimalium belonged to at least three different clones as determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis of smai-digested genomic dna. the capacity that these isolates had to colonize the valvular endothelium was suggested by the occurrence of valvular endocarditis in 12 of 19 cases. demonstration of the same clone in all four houses on a farm suggested the pathogenic potential of this organism.

TI  == molecular profiling of lactobacillus, streptococcus, and bifidobacterium species  in feces of active racehorses.
AB  == diversity and compositions of the lactobacillus, streptococcus, and bifidobacterium group in the feces of six healthy, actively racing horses (thoroughbreds) were analyzed by using pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and real-time pcr with primer sets specific for each group. pcr-dgge analysis of the feces showed that lactobacillus equi, lactobacillus johnsonii, a phylogenetic relative of lactobacillus salivarius, a phylogenetic relative of lactobacillus gastricus, and weissella confusa were predominant in almost all of the feces tested, and streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus was predominant in the streptococcus group. the bifidobacterium group was not detected by single-pcr but atypical species of the  group were found in three of the six thoroughbreds tested by nested-pcr. calculation and estimation of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria revealed that lactic acid bacteria were predominant in the feces and bifidobacteria were minor. these results indicate that the community of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria in horse feces are unique because of the presence of specific species for horse feces and a minority of the bifidobacterium group. repeated tests of the feces from the same horse over 3 months showed that the diversity and composition of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria in the feces was basically stable throughout the test period.

TI  == inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-p), has been documented for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus bovis, and lactococcus lactis, but not for other gram-positive bacteria. using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated atp-dependent hpr(ser) kinase that phosphorylates ser-46 in hpr of the phosphotransferase system. a small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-p phosphatase (pase  ii), previously identified only in lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, or bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. further, lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks pase ii. the results reveal that pase ii is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-p hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. they provide correlative evidence that pase ii initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.

TI  == growth inhibition of streptococcus mutans by cellular extracts of human intestinal lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro growth of streptococcus mutans was completely inhibited by water-soluble extracts from cells of various intestinal lactic acid bacteria identified as streptococcus faecium, streptococcus equinus, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus salivarius. the growth inhibition was dependent on the concentrations of the extracts. in contrast, the extracts did not inhibit the growth of the major indigenous intestinal lactic acid bacteria isolated from humans. these lactic acid bacteria were not acutely toxic in mice.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.

TI  == bacteria associated with the gastric epithelium of neonatal pigs.
AB  == light and electron microscopy showed lactobacilli and, to a lesser degree, streptococci to be closely associated with the squamous area of the pig stomach known as the pars esophagea. several different types of extracellular layers were seen on bacteria attached to the epithelial surface. the total number of bacteria per square centimeter did not change with age up to 10 days, and there was no effect of weaning at 2 days. lactobacillus fermentum, l. salivarius, and streptococcus salivarius were isolated more frequently from sucking pigs than from those that were early weaned, whereas the reverse was true of l. acidophilus and s. bovis. all isolates recovered from washed macerated pars esophagea adhered to pig esophageal epithelial cells when tested in vitro.

TI  == binding of lectins to streptococcus mutans cells and type-specific polysaccharides, and effect on adherence.
AB  == the lectin concanavalin a (con a) agglutinated the cells of 13 of 15 strains of the seven serotypes of streptococcus mutans in an 18-h incubation period. strains of types a, d, f, and g agglutinated within 2 h. strains of a, d, and f were also agglutinated in 2 h by the castor bean lectin rca. s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s.  bovis, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, and lactobacillus plantarum were agglutinated within 2 h. the s. mutans type f polysaccharide was precipitated by  con a. the a, b, c, d, and e polysaccharides were not precipitated. glucan from d and e strains of s. mutans and dextran t2000 were also precipitated by con a. d-glucose inhibited the agglutination of type f cells by con a and the agglutination of type d cells by d-galactose. the quantity of [acetyl-3h]con a bound was not proportional to the degree of agglutination. cells grown in sucrose medium bound more con a than those grown in glucose medium. after treatment with  dextranase, the sucrose-grown cells bound two- to fourfold more con a. the binding of con a to the type-specific polysaccharide or to teichoic acid could not be determined by the use of specific antibody due to the binding of con a to  the antibody globulin on the cell surface. con a bound to s. mutans cells did not inhibit the activity of cell-bound glucosyltransferase, glucan synthesis, and in  vitro adherence. bound con a also did not inhibit the ability of heat-treated cells to bind glucosyltransferase, synthesize glucan, and produce in vitro adherence.

TI  == changes in the microflora and physiology of the anterior intestinal tract of pigs weaned at 2 days, with special reference to the pathogenesis of diarrhea.
AB  == the gastrointestinal microflora and gastric physiology of piglets weaned at 2 days was compared with that of piglets allowed to continue sucking the sow. although there was a significantly higher count of escherichia coli in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum of the early-weaned compared with sow-reared pigs, these differences were not detectable in samples from the ileum. there were no quantitative differences in lactobacilli and in streptococci between the two treatments. lactobacillus fermentum, l. acidophilus, streptococcus salivarius, s. bovis, and related biotypes were isolated from both groups of pigs. l. fermentum  and s. salivarius were isolated more frequently from sow-reared piglets. the weight of digesta in the stomach was greater in weaned than in sucking pigs and was even greater in scouring weaned pigs, suggesting that in scouring pigs there  may be gastric stasis. the gastric ph was higher in the weaned pigs at 4 days of  age, but gradually decreased up to 10 days, during which time the lactic acid concentration rose. in weaned pigs there was a highly significant negative correlation between ph and lactic acid concentration in the stomach digesta, and  also a positive correlation between ph and number of e. coli. these correlations  suggest that lactic acid, from bacterial fermentation, is the major component in  the regulation of gastric ph in weaned pigs. three of twenty sucking pigs, but none of the weaned pigs, were secreting hcl (chloride concentration > 3 mg/g, ph  < 3.5). in sucking pigs there was an inverse relationship between the chloride and lactic acid concentrations in the digesta. in weaned scouring pigs there was  a nonsignificant increase in pepsin concentration in the stomach tissue. there was a threefold increase in the total proteolytic activity of the stomach tissue.
