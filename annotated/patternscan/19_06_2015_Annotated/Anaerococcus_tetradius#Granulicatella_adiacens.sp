TI  == comparison of oral microbiota in tumor and non-tumor tissues of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma.
AB  == background: bacterial infections have been linked to malignancies due to their ability to induce chronic inflammation. we investigated the association of oral bacteria in oral squamous cell carcinoma (oscc/tumor) tissues and compared with adjacent non-tumor mucosa sampled 5 cm distant from the same patient (n = 10). by using culture-independent 16s rrna approaches, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and cloning and sequencing, we assessed the total bacterial diversity in these clinical samples. results: dgge fingerprints showed  variations in the band intensity profiles within non-tumor and tumor tissues of the same patient and among the two groups. the clonal analysis indicated that from a total of 1200 sequences characterized, 80 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected representing six phyla, firmicutes, bacteroidetes, proteobacteria,  fusobacteria, actinobacteria and uncultivated tm7 in non-tumor and tumor libraries. in combined library, 12 classes, 16 order, 26 families and 40 genera were observed. bacterial species, streptococcus sp. oral taxon 058, peptostreptococcus stomatis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus gordonii, gemella haemolysans, gemella morbillorum, johnsonella ignava and streptococcus parasanguinis i were highly associated with tumor site where as granulicatella adiacens was prevalent at non-tumor site. streptococcus intermedius was present in 70% of both non-tumor and tumor sites. conclusions: the underlying changes in  the bacterial diversity in the oral mucosal tissues from non-tumor and tumor sites of oscc subjects indicated a shift in bacterial colonization. these most prevalent or unique bacterial species/phylotypes present in tumor tissues may be  associated with oscc and needs to be further investigated with a larger sample size.

TI  == the subgingival microbiota of papillon-lefevre syndrome.
AB  == background: there is little information about the microbiologic profiles of periodontal lesions in papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls) and the significance of bacteria in the pathogenesis of periodontitis in these patients. this comprehensive analysis of the subgingival microbiota in patients with pls used 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) clonal analysis and the 16s rrna-based human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: thirteen patients with pls from seven unrelated families volunteered for this microbiologic study. subgingival plaque was collected with sterile paper points from multiple sites with >/=5 mm probing depth, and whole genomic dna was extracted. the 16s rrna genes were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. the samples were then probed for approximately 300 predominant oral bacterial species using the homim. results: the most commonly detected phylotypes in the clonal analysis were gemella morbillorum, gemella haemolysans, granulicatella adiacens, lachnospiraceae ot 100 (ei074), parvimonas micra, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. as a group, streptococci were commonly detected in these individuals. in the homim analysis, a total of 170 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected, with a range of 40 to 80 species per patient with pls. of these, 12 bacterial species were detected in medium to high levels in >/=50% of the individuals. the high-frequency strains were clustered into eight groups: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter spp., capnocytophaga granulosa, g. morbillorum, p. micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, streptococcus spp., and tannerella forsythia. conclusions: the subgingival microbiota in pls is diverse.  periodontal pathogens commonly associated with chronic and aggressive periodontitis and opportunistic pathogens may be associated with the development  of severe periodontitis in patients with pls.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.
