TI  - A sequential statistical approach towards an optimized production of a broad spectrum bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium Bacillus sp. YAS 1 strain.
AB  - Bacteriocins, ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides, display potential applications in agriculture, medicine, and industry. The present study highlights integral statistical optimization and partial characterization of a bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium taxonomically affiliated as Bacillus sp. YAS 1 after biochemical and molecular identifications. A sequential statistical approach (Plackett-Burman and Box-Behnken) was employed to optimize bacteriocin (BAC YAS 1) production. Using optimal levels of three key determinants (yeast extract (0.48% (w/v), incubation time (62 hrs), and agitation speed (207 rpm)) in peptone yeast beef based production medium resulted in 1.6-fold enhancement in BAC YAS 1 level (470 AU/mL arbitrary units against Erwinia amylovora). BAC YAS 1 showed activity over a wide range of pH (1-13) and temperature (45-80 degrees C). A wide spectrum antimicrobial activity of BAC YAS 1 against the human pathogens (Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus sp., Proteus sp., Klebsiella sp., and Salmonella typhimurium), the plant pathogen (E. amylovora), and the food spoiler (Listeria innocua) was demonstrated. On top and above, BAC YAS 1 showed no antimicrobial activity towards lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus bulgaricus, L. casei, L. lactis, and L. reuteri). Promising characteristics of BAC YAS 1 prompt its commercialization for efficient utilization in several industries.
TI  - Culture-independent analysis of the microbial composition of the African traditional fermented foods poto poto and degue by using three different DNA extraction methods.
AB  - The microbial composition of the traditional fermented foods poto poto (a maize dough from the Rep. of Congo) and degue (a millet dough from Burkina Faso) was studied by a culture-independent approach using TTGE to separate the amplified target V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene from total microbial community, followed by DNA sequencing and homology search. Three different extraction methods were used. Guanidium thiocyanate-based DNA extraction provided better performance regarding purity and DNA yield, allowing the detection of a higher number of DNA bands by TTGE in poto poto. By contrast, all three methods yielded similar results for degue samples, indicating that the performance of the DNA extraction method largely depends on the food composition. Sequencing of DNA bands from TTGE gels corresponding to poto poto samples revealed the presence of Lactobacillus gasseri, Enterococcus sp., Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus plantarum/paraplantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Bacillus sp., Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus casei. The following bacteria were identified in degue: L. gasseri, Enterococcus sp., E. coli, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus brevis, and L. casei.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis induces inflammatory bowel disease in interleukin-10 knockout mice.
AB  - Germ-free interleukin-10 knockout (IL-10 KO) mice developed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) after they were colonized with a pure culture of Enterococcus faecalis. E. faecalis not only induced IBD (primarily in colon and rectum) but rectal dysplasia and adenocarcinoma was also found in the IL-10 KO mice. Conventional (complex-intestinal flora) IL-10 KO mice developed IBD within 10 to 15 weeks of age and showed more pathology in the cecum (typhlitis) than we observed with E. faecalis-induced IBD in gnotobiotic IL-10 KO mice. Conversely, neither germ-free IL-10 mice nor IL-10 KO mice colonized as adults, with a pure culture of Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei, L. reuteri, L. acidophilus, a Bifidobacterium sp., Lactococcus lactis, or a Bacillus sp. developed IBD during the 25- to 30-week study. E. faecalis is a common intestinal microbe of man and animals that can trigger IBD, dysplasia, and carcinoma in a genetically susceptible murine host.
TI  - In vitro fructooligosaccharide utilization and inhibition of Salmonella spp. by selected bacteria.
AB  - In vitro experiments were conducted to determine: 1) inhibitory capacities of potential direct-fed microbial bacteria against Salmonella serotypes; and 2) the ability of Bifidobacterium bifidum, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus casei, Lactococcus lactis, Pediococcus sp., and Salmonella spp. to grow in media containing fructooligosaccharides (FOS-50 or FOS pure formulation) as the only carbohydrate source. Thirteen bacteria (two strains of Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus subtilis, B. bifidum, E. faecium, two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. casei, Pediococcus sp., Propionibacterium acidopropionici, P. jensenii, and Propionibacterium sp.) were tested for inhibition of six Salmonella serotypes (S. california, S. enteritidis, S. heidelberg, S. mission, S. senftenberg, and S. typhimurium) using a spot-the-lawn technique. Bifidobacterium bifidum, E. faecium, all lactobacilli, and Pediococcus sp. clearly inhibited growth of all Salmonella serotypes. In the growth experiments, E. faecium, L. lactis, and Pediococcus sp. grew in media with either FOS-50 or the pure formulation of FOS as the sole carbohydrate source. All tested Salmonella serotypes utilized FOS-50 for growth; however growth varied among the serotypes. In contrast, none of the Salmonella serotypes grew in media containing the pure formulation of FOS as the only carbohydrate source.
TI  - Organization and characterization of three genes involved in D-xylose catabolism  in Lactobacillus pentosus.
AB  - A cluster of three genes involved in D-xylose catabolism (viz. xylose genes) in Lactobacillus pentosus has been cloned in Escherichia coli and characterized by nucleotide sequence analysis. The deduced gene products show considerable sequence similarity to a repressor protein involved in the regulation of expression of xylose genes in Bacillus subtilis (58%), to E. coli and B. subtilis D-xylose isomerase (68% and 77%, respectively), and to E. coli D-xylulose kinase (58%). The cloned genes represent functional xylose genes since they are able to complement the inability of a L. casei strain to ferment D-xylose. NMR analysis confirmed that 13C-xylose was converted into 13C-acetate in L. casei cells transformed with L. pentosus xylose genes but not in untransformed L. casei cells. Comparison with the aligned amino acid sequences of D-xylose isomerases of different bacteria suggests that L. pentosus D-xylose isomerase belongs to the same similarity group as B. subtilis and E. coli D-xylose isomerase and not to a second similarity group comprising D-xylose isomerases of Streptomyces violaceoniger, Ampullariella sp. and Actinoplanes. The organization of the L. pentosus xylose genes, 5'-xylR (1167 bp, repressor) - xylA (1350 bp, D-xylose isomerase) - xylB (1506 bp, D-xylulose kinase) - 3' is similar to that in B. subtilis. In contrast to B. subtilis xylR, L. pentosus xylR is transcribed in the same direction as xylA and xylB.
TI  - [Effect of solid substrates of microbial colony development].
AB  - Bacteria have been found to grow differently at contact sites to both organic and anorganic solids as on pure agar media. Of 16 ad hoc selected bacterial strains, the following species (arranged in decreasing order) responded with stronger colony formation: Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Streptococcus sanguis, S. saprophyticus, S. faecalis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus flavus, Actinomyces viscosus, Veillonella sp., Enterobacter liquefaciens, Yersinia enterocolitica. Lactobacillus casei behaved neutral. Proteus vulgaris, Y. enterocolitica and Chromobacterium violaceum grow on certain media only in the presence of solid particles. The yeasts Endomyces lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and Cryptococcus nigricans did not respond to solid particles during colony formation. The kind of protein-animal (meat) or vegetable (soy beans)-did not influence the behaviour of the microorganisms in these experiments.

TI  - Controlled cell disruption: a comparison of the forces required to disrupt different micro-organisms.
AB  - A cell disrupter has been developed which can measure the forces required to disrupt both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. It operates a continuous process and will disrupt both large and small volumes. Shear forces are set up when a suspension under laminar flow conditions is released under high pressure through a short orifice. If the applied pressure is altered, the shear forces are simultaneously changed so that the amount of cell disruption can be compared under different known and repeatable conditions. The disrupter is now manufactured and supplied by Stansted Fluid Power Limited, Stansted, England. Phase-contrast microscopy has shown that the disrupter will break a variety of organisms including Chlorella, Aspergillus fumigatis, Fusarium sp., Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei, Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium perfringens, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus zooepidermicus and Staphylococcus aureus. The cells are not all broken at one pressure but a certain pressure must be applied before disruption starts which will then increase rapidly as the applied pressure is increased. The applied pressure required to disrupt half the population in a culture is different from one species to another, rods being disrupted more easily than spheres. The case of disruption seems to be related to the shape and chemical composition of the cell wall. Furthermore, the disrupting process, in an unsynchronized culture is not random and may be related to the statistical size distribution of the cells.
