TI  == growth-inhibiting and morphostructural effects of constituents identified in asarum heterotropoides root on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == background: the growth-inhibiting and morphostructural effects of seven constituents identified in asarum heterotropoides root on 14 intestinal bacteria  were compared with those of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin. method: a microtiter plate-based bioassay in sterile 96-well plates was used to evaluate  the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the test materials against the organisms. results: delta-3-carene (5) exhibited the most potent growth inhibition of gram-positive bacteria (clostridium difficile atcc 9689, clostridium paraputrificum atcc 25780, clostridium perfringens atcc 13124, and staphylococcus aureus atcc 12600) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli atcc 11775 and bacteroides fragilis atcc 25285) (minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic), 0.18-0.70 mg/ml) except for salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 13311 (mic, 2.94 mg/ml). the mic of methyleugenol (2), 1,8-cineole (3), alpha-asarone (4), (-)-asarinin (6), and pellitorine (7) was between 1.47 and 2.94 mg/ml against all test bacteria (except for compound 2 against c. difficile (0.70 mg/ml); compounds 1 (23.50 mg/ml) and 4 (5.80 mg/ml) against c. paraputricum; compounds 2 (5.80 mg/ml), 4 (12.0 mg/ml), and 7 (0.70 mg/ml) against c. perfringens); compound 1 against e. coli (7.20 mg/ml) and s. enterica serovar typhimurium (12.0 mg/ml). overall, all of the constituents were  less potent at inhibiting microbial growth than ciprofloxacin (mic, 0.063-0.25 mg/ ml). the lactic acid-producing bacteria (four bifidobacteria and two lactobacilli) and one acidulating bacterium clostridium butyricum atcc 25779 were less sensitive and more susceptible than the five harmful bacteria and two nonpathogenic bacteria (b. fragilis and e. coli) to the constituents and to ciprofloxacin, respectively. beneficial gram-positive bacteria and harmful and nonpathogenic gram-negative bacteria were observed to have different degrees of antimicrobial susceptibility to the constituents, although the antimicrobial susceptibility of the harmful gram-positive bacteria and the harmful and nonpathogenic gram-negative bacteria was not observed. scanning electron microscopy observations showed different degrees of physical damage and morphological alteration to both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria treated with alpha-asarone, delta-3-carene, pellitorine, or ciprofloxacin, indicating that they do not share a common mode of action. conclusion: a. heterotropoides root-derived materials described merit further study as potential antibacterial products or lead molecules for the prevention or eradication from humans from diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.

TI  == conversion of glycerol to poly(3-hydroxypropionate) in recombinant escherichia coli.
AB  == we have developed the conversion of glycerol into thermoplastic poly(3-hydroxypropionate) [poly(3hp)]. for this, the genes for glycerol dehydratase (dhab1) of clostridium butyricum, propionaldehyde dehydrogenase (pdup) of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium lt2, and polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha) synthase (phac1) of ralstonia eutropha were expressed in recombinant escherichia coli. poly(3hp) was accumulated up to 11.98% (wt/wt [cell dry weight]) in a two-step, fed-batch fermentation. the present study shows an interesting application to engineer a poly(3hp) synthesis pathway in bacteria.

TI  == effect of carbohydrate composition in barley and oat cultivars on microbial ecophysiology and proliferation of salmonella enterica in an in vitro model of the porcine gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == the influence of the carbohydrate (cho) composition of cereal cultivars on microbial ecophysiology was studied using an in vitro model of the porcine gastrointestinal tract. ten hull-less barley cultivars, six barley cultivars with hulls, six oat cultivars, and six oat groats that differed in beta-glucan, nonstarch polysaccharide (nsp), and starch contents and starch type were hydrolyzed enzymatically and incubated for 72 h with pig feces. fermentation kinetics were modeled, and microbial compositions and short-chain fatty acid (scfa) profiles were analyzed using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and gas chromatography. cluster analysis and canonical ordination revealed different effects on fermentation and microbial ecology depending on the type of cho and cultivar. first, in cultivars of barley with hulls and oats, the  cellulose and insoluble nsp contents (i) increased ruminococcus flavefaciens-like and clostridium xylanolyticum-like phylotypes, (ii) increased acetate production, and (iii) decreased fermentation activity. second, in hull-less barley cultivars  the beta-glucan, amylose, amylopectin, crude protein, and soluble nsp contents determined the microbial community composition and activity as follows: (i) the amylose contents of the hull-less barley varieties increased the butyrate production and the abundance of clostridium butyricum-like phylotypes, (ii) the beta-glucan content determined the total amounts of scfa, and (iii) the amylopectin and starch contents affected the abundance of clostridium ramosum-like phylotypes, members of clostridium cluster xiva, and bacteroides-like bacteria. finally, the effect of cho on proliferation of salmonella enterica in the model was determined. salmonella cell counts were not  affected, but the relative proportion of salmonella decreased with hull-less barley cultivars and increased with oat cultivars as revealed by quantitative pcr. our results shed light on the complex interactions of cereal cho with intestinal bacterial ecophysiology and the possible impact on host health.
