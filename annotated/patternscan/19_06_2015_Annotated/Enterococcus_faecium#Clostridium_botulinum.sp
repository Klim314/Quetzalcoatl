TI  == the effect of glyphosate on potential pathogens and beneficial members of poultry microbiota in vitro.
AB  == the use of glyphosate modifies the environment which stresses the living microorganisms. the aim of the present study was to determine the real impact of  glyphosate on potential pathogens and beneficial members of poultry microbiota in vitro. the presented results evidence that the highly pathogenic bacteria as salmonella entritidis, salmonella gallinarum, salmonella typhimurium, clostridium perfringens and clostridium botulinum are highly resistant to glyphosate. however, most of beneficial bacteria as enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, bacillus badius, bifidobacterium adolescentis and lactobacillus spp. were found to be moderate to highly susceptible. also campylobacter spp. were found to be susceptible to glyphosate. a reduction of beneficial bacteria in the  gastrointestinal tract microbiota by ingestion of glyphosate could disturb the normal gut bacterial community. also, the toxicity of glyphosate to the most prevalent enterococcus spp. could be a significant predisposing factor that is associated with the increase in c. botulinum-mediated diseases by suppressing the antagonistic effect of these bacteria on clostridia.

TI  == biochemical and genetic characterization of enterocin p, a novel sec-dependent bacteriocin from enterococcus faecium p13 with a broad antimicrobial spectrum.
AB  == enterocin p is a new bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium p13 isolated from a spanish dry-fermented sausage. enterocin p inhibited most of tested spoilage and food-borne gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, such as listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium botulinum. enterocin p is produced during growth in mrs broth from 16 to 45 degrees c; it is heat resistant (60 min at 100 degrees c; 15 min at 121 degrees c) and can withstand exposure to ph between 2.0 and 11.0, freeze-thawing, lyophilization, and long-term storage at 4 and -20 degrees c. the bacteriocin was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration, cation-exchange, hydrophobic-interaction, and reverse-phase liquid chromatography. the sequence of 43 amino acids of the n terminus was obtained by  edman degradation. dna sequencing analysis of a 755-bp region revealed the presence of two consecutive open reading frames (orfs). the first orf encodes a 71-amino-acid protein containing a hydrophobic n-terminal sec-dependent leader sequence of 27 amino acids followed by the amino acid sequence corresponding to the purified and sequenced enterocin p. the bacteriocin is apparently synthesized as a prepeptide that is cleaved immediately after the val-asp-ala residues (positions -3 to -1), resulting in the mature bacteriocin consisting of 44 amino  acids, and with a theoretical molecular weight of 4,493. a second orf, encoding a putative immunity protein composed of 88 amino acids with a calculated molecular  weight of 9,886, was found immediately downstream of the enterocin p structural gene. enterocin p shows a strong antilisterial activity and has the consensus sequence found in the pediocin-like bacteriocins; however, enterocin p is processed and secreted by the sec-dependent pathway.
