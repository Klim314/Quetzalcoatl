TI  == osteoradionecrosis contains a wide variety of cultivable and non-cultivable bacteria.
AB  == background: direct microscopy, anaerobic culture and dna-dna hybridization have previously demonstrated an association between microorganisms and osteoradionecrosis (orn). the purpose of our study was to use culture independent molecular techniques to detect bacteria in necrotic bone lesions of the mandible  after radiation therapy. design: bacterial dna was extracted from eight deep medullar specimens from resected mandibles (six cases), including one patient with relapse. 16s rrna genes were pcr amplified, cloned, transformed into escherichia coli and sequenced to determine species identity and closest relatives. results: from the analysis of 438 clones, 59 predominant species were  detected, 27% of which have not been cultivated. the predominant species detected from radionecrotic mandibles were campylobacter gracilis, streptococcus intermedius, peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone fg014, uncultured bacterium clone  rl178, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella spp. the study demonstrated intersubject variability of the bacteria present in orn. in contrast to the diverse bacterial profile detected in primary infection, only a few members of the oral indigenous flora were identified from the relapse case. conclusions: diverse bacterial profiles in specimens of orn in marrow spaces of the mandible were detected by culture independent molecular techniques. to better understand the pathogenesis and to improve the therapy of the infection, detection of all members of the complex bacterial flora associated with orn is necessary.

TI  == clinical and microbiological characteristics of smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  == cigarette smoking is a potential risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. the objective of this study was to compare  the microbial profile of smokers and non-smokers in a group of patients with early onset periodontitis. the study population consisted of 60 healthy individuals, 40 males and 20 females aged 22 to 35 yr, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. thirty patients were smokers (30.9 cigarettes/d) and 30 non-smokers. smokers had a higher proportion of deep pockets (pd >5 mm), especially in the maxilla anterior and premolar regions (p < 0.001) and presented a significantly greater mean probing depth and attachment loss (p <0.05) in diseased sites and a significantly greater alveolar bone loss (p <0.01) compared  to non-smokers. two pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. samples were collected from the deepest periodontal pockets of each quadrant. the samples were cultured anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits.  smokers harboured a greater number of bacteria in total. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann-whitney u-test) showed that staphylococcus aureus, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, escherichia coli, bacteroides  forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, selenomonas sputigena, candida albicans and aspergillus fumigatus were found in significantly higher numbers and more frequently in smokers while streptococcus intermedius, a. naeslundii, a. israelii and eubacterium lentum were detected more frequently and  in significantly higher proportions in non-smokers. the isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora such as e. coli, c. albicans, a. fumigatus and s. aureus in smokers' microbiota underscores the importance of the host that is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.

TI  == subgingival microflora in smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  == cigarette smoking is a potent risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. the objective of this study was to detect the microbial profile of early onset periodontitis in smokers and compare it to that  of non-smokers. the study population consisted of 50 systemically healthy individuals aged 25 to 38 years, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. 25 patients were smokers (> 20 cigarettes/day) and 25 non-smokers. two pooled bacterial samples comprised of four periodontal sites with probing depth > 5 mm each, were collected from each individual. the samples were cultured aerobically  and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. the differences in bacterial counts using  the mann whitney u test were statistically significant for staphylococcus aureus, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens, escherichia coli, bacteroides forsythus, bacteroides gracilis, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis,  selenomonas sputigena and candida albicans in smokers. statistically significant  differences for peptostreptococcus micros, actinomyces naeslundii, eubacterium lentum and capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in non-smokers. the isolation  of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora like e. coli, c. albicans and s. aureus in smokers microflora underscores the importance of the host which is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of ofloxacin against recent isolates from patients with community-acquired infections].
AB  == in order to survey antibacterial activities of ofloxacin (oflx) against 1,440 bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired infections in 1987 and 1990, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the drug as well as those of other new quinolones and oral cephems were determined. the following conclusions were reached. 1. comparison of the mic distribution for strains isolated in 1987 with those in 1990 suggested a tendency toward an increase in the frequency of oflx-resistant isolates with the passage of time of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella ssp., enterobacter spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. most common elevations of mic  values against these bacteria were observed in mic80 and mic90 values, while no significant alteration was observed in mic50 values. however, mic50's of oflx against serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa were relatively high for strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. most of the oflx-resistant strains of s.  aureus seemed to be methicillin-resistant (mrsa). furthermore, mic80 of oflx against coagulase-negative staphylococci was high in strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. 2. susceptibility of streptococcus spp. was evaluated only in strains isolated in 1990. the results were comparable to those reported by others in the early 1980s. 3. bacteria which showed no or infrequent emergence of oflx-resistant strains even in 1990 were proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, campylobacter spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. 4. recently isolated strains from patients with community-acquired infections showed a tendency toward an increase of the frequency of oflx-resistant strains among many bacteria. however, the bacteria which contained high percentages of oflx-resistant strains except for mrsa were so-called less-virulent bacteria, and in the other bacteria elevations of mic values were only observed in mic80 and mic90. these results suggested that oflx preserved a potent antibacterial activity against bacteria which were major causative pathogens in community-acquired infections.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  == lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. in this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated  antimicrobials. lomefloxacin was very active against enterobacteriaceae (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). in common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of neisseria spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), haemophilus spp. (mic90, less  than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), legionella spp. (mic90, less than or equal  to 0.06 micrograms/ml), vibrio spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 1 microgram/ml). lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of bacteroides spp. (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) or clostridium difficile mic90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of clostridium perfringens (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), peptostreptococcus spp. (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), chlamydia trachomatis (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), mycoplasma hominis (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), and urea-plasma urealyticum (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the mic with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of escherichia coli and s. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the mic. these results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections  caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by s. aureus.

TI  == coumamidines, new broad spectrum antibiotics of the cinodine type. iii. microbiologic activity of coumamidine gamma 1.
AB  == the coumamidines are novel antibiotics with activity against a wide spectrum of aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. all microbiological studies were performed on coumamidine gamma 1. the mic90s (micrograms/ml) of coumamidine  are as follows: staphylococcus aureus 1.0, streptococcus pyogenes 8, enterobacteriaceae 2.0, pseudomonas aeruginosa 8, campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli 1, legionella pneumophila 8, haemophilus influenzae 0.5, neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.5. coumamidine had mics ranging from 8 to greater 0.5, neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.5. coumamidine had mics ranging from 8 to greater than 64 for most anaerobes, except some peptostreptococcus strains. the aminoglycoside super-sensitive strain, p. aeruginosa bmh 10, was also super-sensitive to coumamidine (mic 0.2 micrograms/ml). coumamidine was rapidly bactericidal for s.  aureus. the viable bacterial count in logarithmic phase cultures was reduced to less than 10 cfu within 2 hours after exposure to 4 times the mic (3.12 micrograms/ml) of coumamidine. the frequency of resistance development was less than 1 x 10(-9) for escherichia coli and s. aureus when selected at 4 and 8 times the mic. the cmax in mouse serum after a single subcutaneous dose of 25 mg/kg of  coumamidine was 4.5 micrograms/ml and t1/2 was 1 hour. coumamidine is stable in serum. in mouse protection tests against s. aureus nctc 10649 the ed50 was less than 0.6 mg/kg/day when it was administered subcutaneously at 1 and 5 hours after infection. coumamidine was not absorbed after oral administration. the antibacterial spectrum, bactericidal activity, stability in serum and low frequency of resistance make this an interesting new class of antibiotics.
