TI  - Identification of lactic acid bacteria associated with the production of plaa-som, a traditional fermented fish product of Thailand.
AB  - Plaa-som is a Thai fermented fish product for which whole fish or fish fillets are fermented with either cooked rice or steamed sticky rice, salt, and garlic. A total of 762 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated during plaa-som fermentation by culture on CaCO(3)-MRS agar plates. They were screened and grouped by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA), giving six groups that were identified by ribosomal DNA sequencing as Lactococcus garvieae, Streptococcus bovis, Weissella cibaria, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus fermentum. Freshly mixed ingredients contained low populations of LAB (less than 10 CFU/g) that subsequently grew during fermentation to final populations of approximately 10(7)CFU/g. Early stages of the process were dominated by the presence of Lc. garvieae, S. bovis, and W. cibaria. At 48 h into fermentation, W. cibaria, P. pentosaceus, and Lb. plantarum were prevalent, and gave way to a dominance of Lb. plantarum that completed the fermentation. A mixture of these LAB species could be considered as species for development of a starter culture for plaa-som fermentation.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria as reducing and capping agent for the fast and efficient production of silver nanoparticles.
AB  - There is a growing demand for silver-based biocides, including both ionic silver  forms and metallic nanosilver. The use of metallic nanosilver, typically chemically produced, faces challenges including particle agglomeration, high costs, and upscaling difficulties . Additionally, there exists a need for the development of a more eco-friendly production of nanosilver. In this study, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were utilized in the non-enzymatic production of silver nanoparticles via the interaction of silver ions and organic compounds present on the bacterial cell. Only lactic acid bacteria, Lactobacillus spp., Pediococcus pentosaceus, Enterococcus faecium, and Lactococcus garvieae, were able to reduce silver. The nanoparticles of the five best producing Lactobacillus spp. were examined more into detail with transmission electron microscopy. Particle localization inside the cell, the mean particle size, and size distribution were species dependent, with Lactobacillus fermentum having the smallest mean particle size of 11.2 nm, the most narrow size distribution, and most nanoparticles associated with the outside of the cells. Furthermore, influence of pH on the reduction process was investigated. With increasing pH, silver recovery increased as well as the reduction rate as indicated by UV-VIS analyses. This study demonstrated that Lactobacillus spp. can be used for a rapid and efficient production of silver nanoparticles.
TI  - Use of Lactobacillus strains to start cassava fermentations for Gari production.
AB  - Two Lactobacillus strains, Lactobacillus plantarum BFE 6710 and Lactobacillus fermentum BFE 6620, were used to start cassava fermentations in a pilot study under field production conditions in Kenya, to determine their potential to establish themselves as predominant lactobacilli during the fermentation. Predominant strains from three fermentations were isolated throughout the 48 h fermentation period. The use of these strains in high numbers clearly resulted in 1 to 2 log higher lactic acid bacteria (LAB) counts over the course of the fermentation when compared to the uninoculated control. 178 predominant LAB isolates were grouped based on their phenotypic characteristics, and were characterised to strain level by RAPD-PCR, followed by PFGE strain typing. Overall, L. plantarum strains represented the majority of the isolates, followed by Weissella confusa and Lactococcus garvieae strains. The results of RAPD-PCR and PFGE strain typing techniques indicated that L. plantarum BFE 6710 was successful in asserting itself as a predominant strain. In contrast, L. fermentum BFE 6620 failed to establish itself as a predominant organism in the fermentation. The success of the L. plantarum strains to predominate in the cassava fermentation demonstrates the potential for development of Lactobacillus starter cultures to industrialise the Gari production process.
