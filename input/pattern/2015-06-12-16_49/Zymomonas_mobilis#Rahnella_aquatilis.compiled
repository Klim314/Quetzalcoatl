TI  - Antitumor activity of levan polysaccharides from selected microorganisms.
AB  - Levans were isolated from the cultures of Gluconoacetobacter xylinus (G-levan; Mw = 40,000), Microbacterium laevaniformans (M; Mw = 710,000), Rahnella aquatilis (R; Mw = 380,000), and Zymomonas mobilis (Z; Mw = 570,000). The levans were composed mainly of fructose residues when analyzed by TLC and HPLC, and their main backbones were beta-(2,6)-linkages with beta-(2,1)-branches by GC-MS and NMR. In the in vitro antitumor activity test of the levans against eight different tumor cell lines, relatively stronger activity was observed from the SNU-1 and HepG2. The M- (52.54-62.05%) and R-levan (52.15-58.58%) showed the significantly high activity against SNU-1, while M-levan showed the highest (49.93-61.82%) activity against HepG2. During the in vivo analysis of inhibitory activity of the levans against Sarcoma-180 growth, M-, R- and Z-levans showed strong antitumor activity (average 66%) but G-levan (42%) had significantly lower activity.
TI  - Refolding and purification of Zymomonas mobilis levansucrase produced as inclusion bodies in fed-batch culture of recombinant Escherichia coli.
AB  - Zymomonas mobilis levansucrase was overproduced by the fed-batch culture of recombinant Escherichia coli harboring a novel expression system that is constitutively expressed by the promoter from the Rahnella aquatilis levansucrase gene. Most of the levansucrase was produced as inclusion bodies in the bacterial cytoplasm, accounting for approximately 20% of the total cellular protein. Refolding after complete denaturation by high concentrations of urea or guanidine hydrochloride was not successful, resulting in large amounts of insoluble aggregates. During the development of the refolding method, it was found that direct solubilization of the inclusion bodies with Triton X-100 reactivated the enzyme, with a considerable refolding efficiency. About 65% of inclusion body levansucrase was refolded into active levansucrase in the renaturation buffer containing 4% (v/v) Triton X-100. The in vitro refolded enzyme was purified to 95% purity by single-step DEAE-Sepharose ion exchange chromatography. Triton X-100 was removed by this ion exchange chromatography.
