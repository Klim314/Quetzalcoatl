TI  == quantitatively predicting bacterial adhesion using surface free energy determined with a spectrophotometric method.
AB  == bacterial adhesion onto solid surfaces is of importance in a wide spectrum of problems, including environmental microbiology, biomedical research, and various  industrial applications. despite many research efforts, present thermodynamic models that rely on the evaluation of the adhesion energy are often elusive in predicting the bacterial adhesion behavior. here, we developed a new spectrophotometric method to determine the surface free energy (sfe) of bacterial cells. the adhesion behaviors of five bacterial species, pseudomonas putida kt2440, salmonella typhimurium atcc 14028, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, and escherichia coli dh5alpha, onto two model substratum surfaces, i.e., clean glass and silanized glass surfaces, were studied. we found that bacterial adhesion was unambiguously mediated by the sfe difference between the bacterial cells and the solid substratum. the lower the sfe difference, the higher degree of bacterial adhesion. we therefore propose the use of the sfe difference as an accurate and simple thermodynamic measure for quantitatively predicting bacterial adhesion. the methodological advance and thermodynamic simplification in the paper have implications in controlling bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation on solid surfaces.

TI  == surface free energy activated high-throughput cell sorting.
AB  == cell sorting is an important screening process in microbiology, biotechnology, and clinical research. existing methods are mainly based on single-cell analysis  as in flow cytometric and microfluidic cell sorters. here we report a label-free  bulk method for sorting cells by differentiating their characteristic surface free energies (sfes). we demonstrated the feasibility of this method by sorting model binary cell mixtures of various bacterial species, including pseudomonas putida kt2440, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, salmonella typhimurium atcc 14028, and escherichia coli dh5alpha. this method can effectively separate 10(10) bacterial cells within 30 min. individual bacterial species can be sorted with up to 96% efficiency, and the cell viability ratio can be as high as 99%. in addition to its capacity of sorting evenly mixed bacterial cells, we demonstrated the feasibility of this method in selecting and enriching cells of minor populations in the mixture (presenting at only 1% in quantity) to a purity as high as 99%. this sfe-activated method may be used as a stand-alone method for quickly sorting a large quantity of bacterial cells or as a prescreening tool for microbial discrimination. given its advantages of label-free, high-throughput, low cost, and simplicity, this sfe-activated cell sorting method has potential in various applications of sorting cells and abiotic particles.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in bacteria isolated from vegetables with regards to the marketing stage (farm vs. supermarket).
AB  == the aim of this study was to elucidate whether and to what extent fresh produce from germany plays a role as a carrier and reservoir of antibiotic resistant bacteria. for this purpose, 1001 vegetables (fruit, root, bulbous vegetables, salads and cereals) were collected from 13 farms and 11 supermarkets in germany and examined bacteriologically. phenotypic resistance of enterobacter cloacae (n=172); enterobacter gergoviae (n=92); pantoea agglomerans (n=96); pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=295); pseudomonas putida (n=106) and enterococcus faecalis (n=100)  against up to 30 antibiotics was determined by using the microdilution method. resistance to ss-lactams was most frequently expressed by p. agglomerans and e. gergoviae against cefaclor (41% and 29%). relatively high resistance rates were also observed for doxycycline (23%), erythromycin (21%) and rifampicin (65%) in e. faecalis, for spectinomycin (28%) and mezlocillin (12%) in e. cloacae, as well as for streptomycin (19%) in p. putida. in p. aeruginosa, relatively low resistance rates were observed for the aminoglycosides amikacin, apramicin, gentamicin, neomycin, netilmicin and tobramycin (<4%); 11% was resistant to streptomycin. no glycopeptide-resistant enterococci were observed. resistance rates of bacteria isolated from farm samples were higher than those of the retail markets whenever significant differences were observed. this suggests that expressing resistance is at the expense of bacterial viability, since vegetables  purchased directly at the farm are probably fresher than at the supermarket, and  they have not been exposed to stress factors. however, this should not keep the customer from buying directly at the farm, since the overall resistance rates were not higher than observed in bacteria from human or animal origin. instead, peeling or washing vegetables before eating them raw is highly recommended, since it reduces not only the risk of contact with pathogens, but also that of ingesting and spreading antibiotic resistant bacteria.

TI  == survival of campylobacter jejuni under conditions of atmospheric oxygen tension with the support of pseudomonas spp.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is a major food-borne pathogen. despite causing enteritis in humans, it is a well-adapted intestinal microorganism in animals, hardly ever generating disease symptoms. nevertheless, as a true microaerophilic microorganism it is still puzzling how campylobacter cells can survive on chicken meat, the main source of human infection. in this study, we demonstrate that c. jejuni is able to withstand conditions of atmospheric oxygen tension when cocultured with pseudomonas species, major food-spoiling bacteria that are frequently found on chicken meat in rather high numbers. using an in vitro survival assay, interactions of 145 c. jejuni wild-type strains and field isolates from chicken meat, broiler feces, and human clinical samples with type strains and food isolates of pseudomonas spp., proteus mirabilis, citrobacter freundii, micrococcus luteus, and enterococcus faecalis were studied. when inoculated alone or in coculture with proteus mirabilis, citrobacter freundii, micrococcus luteus, or enterococcus faecalis type strains, campylobacter cells were able to survive ambient oxygen levels for no more than 18 h. in contrast, campylobacter bacteria inoculated with type strains or wild-type isolates of pseudomonas showed a prolonged aerobic survival of up to >48 h. this microbial commensalism was diverse in c. jejuni isolates from different sources; isolates from chicken meat and humans in coculture with pseudomonas putida were able to use this survival support better than fecal isolates from broilers. scanning electron microscopy revealed the development of fiberlike structures braiding p.  putida and c. jejuni cells. hence, it seems that microaerophilic c. jejuni is able to survive ambient atmospheric oxygen tension by metabolic commensalism with pseudomonas spp. this bacterium-bacterium interaction might set the basis for survival of c. jejuni on chicken meat and thus be the prerequisite step in the pathway toward human infection.

TI  == intra- and interspecies conjugal transfer of tn916-like elements from lactococcus lactis in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == tetracycline-resistant lactococcus lactis strains originally isolated from polish raw milk were analyzed for the ability to transfer their antibiotic resistance genes in vitro, using filter mating experiments, and in vivo, using germfree rats. four of six analyzed l. lactis isolates were able to transfer tetracycline  resistance determinants in vitro to l. lactis bu2-60, at frequencies ranging from 10(-5) to 10(-7) transconjugants per recipient. three of these four strains could also transfer resistance in vitro to enterococcus faecalis jh2-2, whereas no transfer to bacillus subtilis ybe01, pseudomonas putida kt2442, agrobacterium tumefaciens ubapf2, or escherichia coli je2571 was observed. rats were initially  inoculated with the recipient e. faecalis strain jh2-2, and after a week, the l.  lactis ibb477 and ibb487 donor strains were introduced. the first transconjugants were detected in fecal samples 3 days after introduction of the donors. a subtherapeutic concentration of tetracycline did not have any significant effect  on the number of transconjugants, but transconjugants were observed earlier in animals dosed with this antibiotic. molecular analysis of in vivo transconjugants containing the tet(m) gene showed that this gene was identical to tet(m) localized on the conjugative transposon tn916. primer-specific pcr confirmed that the tn916 transposon was complete in all analyzed transconjugants and donors. this is the first study showing in vivo transfer of a tn916-like antibiotic resistance transposon from l. lactis to e. faecalis. these data suggest that in certain cases food lactococci might be involved in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes to other lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == attachment of ampicillin to expanded poly(tetrafluoroethylene): surface reactions leading to inhibition of microbial growth.
AB  == the broad spectrum antibiotic, ampicillin (am), was reacted to expanded poly (tetrafluoroethylene) (eptfe) surfaces and resulted in the formation of antimicrobial surfaces effective against gram-positive, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus thuringiensis, and enterococcus faecalis, and gram-negative, escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, and salmonella enterica bacteria. these eptfe surface modifications were accomplished by utilization of microwave maleic anhydride (ma) plasma reactions leading to the formation of acid groups, followed by amidation reactions of heterofunctional nh 2/cooh-terminated polyethylene glycol (peg). the final step, the attachment of am to the peg spacer, was achieved by amidation reactions between cooh-terminated peg and nh 2 groups of am. this approach protects the cooh-am functionality and diminishes the possibility of hydrolysis of the antimicrobial active portion of am. these studies also show that approximately 90% of am molecules are still covalently attached to peg-ma-eptfe surfaces after exposure to the bacteria solutions. even after a 24 h period, the  am volume concentration changes only from 2.25 to 2.04 microg/m3, and depending upon the bacteria type, the bacteria suspensions containing am-peg-ma-eptfe specimens retain 85-99% of their initial optical density.

TI  == stability of microbial communities in goat milk during a lactation year: molecular approaches.
AB  == the microbial communities in milks from one herd were evaluated during 1-year of  lactation, using molecular methods to evaluate their stability and the effect of  breeding conditions on their composition. the diversity of microbial communities  was measured using two approaches: molecular identification by 16s and 18s rdna sequencing of isolates from counting media (two milks), and direct identification using 16s rdna from clone libraries (six milks). the stability of these communities was evaluated by counting on selective media and by single strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis of variable region v3 of the 16s rrna gene and variable region v4 of the 18s rrna gene. one hundred and eighteen milk samples taken throughout the year were analyzed. wide diversity among bacteria and yeasts in the milk was revealed. in addition to species commonly encountered  in milk, such as lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garvieae, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus caprae, staphylococcus equorum, micrococcus sp., kocuria sp., pantoea agglomerans and pseudomonas putida, sequences were affiliated to other species only described in cheeses, such as corynebacterium variabile, arthrobacter sp., brachybacterium paraconglomeratum, clostridium sp. and rothia sp. several halophilic species atypical in milk were found, belonging to jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, salinicoccus sp., dietza maris, exiguobacterium, ornithinicoccus sp. and hahella chejuensis. the yeast community  was composed of debaryomyces hansenii, kluyveromyces lactis, trichosporon beigelii, rhodotorula glutinis, rhodotorula minuta, candida pararugosa, candida intermedia, candida inconspicua, cryptococcus curvatus and cryptococcus magnus. the analyses of microbial counts and microbial sscp profiles both distinguished four groups of milks corresponding to four periods defined by season and feeding  regime. the microbial community was stable within each period. milks from winter  were characterized by lactococcus and pseudomonas, those from summer by p. agglomerans and klebsiella and those from autumn by chryseobacterium indologenes, acinetobacter baumanii, staphylococcus, corynebacteria and yeasts. however, the composition of the community can vary according to factors other than feeding. this study opens new investigation fields in the field of raw milk microbial ecology.

TI  == antimicrobial potential of immobilized lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis atcc 11454 against selected bacteria.
AB  == immobilization of living cells of lactic acid bacteria could be an alternative or complementary method of immobilizing organic acids and bacteriocins and inhibit undesirable bacteria in foods. this study evaluated the inhibition potential of immobilized lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis atcc 11454 on selected bacteria by a modified method of the agar spot test. l. lactis was immobilized in calcium alginate (1 to 2%)-whey protein concentrate (0 and 1%) beads. the antimicrobial potential of immobilized l. lactis was evaluated in microbiological media against pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, salmonella, and staphylococcus aureus) or  pseudomonas putida, a natural meat contaminant, and against seven gram-positive bacteria used as indicator strains. results obtained in this study indicated that immobilized l. lactis inhibited the growth of s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus sakei, kocuria varians, and pediococcus acidilactici. only 4 h of incubation at 35 degrees c resulted in a clear inhibition zone around the beads that increased with time. with the addition of 10 mm of a chelating agent (edta) to the media, results showed growth inhibition of e. coli; however, p. putida and salmonella typhi were unaffected by this treatment. these results indicate that immobilized lactic acid bacteria strains can be successfully used to produce nisin and inhibit bacterial  growth in semisolid synthetic media.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of eucalyptus leaf extracts and flavonoids from eucalyptus maculata.
AB  == aims: we investigated the antimicrobial activities of eucalyptus leaf extracts to find effective antibacterial agents. methods and results: the antimicrobial activities of leaf extracts from 26 species of eucalyptus were measured. extracts of eucalyptus globulus, e. maculata and e. viminalis significantly inhibited the  growth of six gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, mrsa, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, propionibacterium acnes), and of a fungus (trichophyton mentagrophytes), but they did not show strong antibacterial activity against gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida). 2',6'-dihydroxy-3'-methyl-4'-methoxy-dihydrochalcone, eucalyptin and 8-desmethyl-eucalyptin, isolated from e. maculata extracts, exhibited potent antimicrobial activities against seven micro-organisms with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) ranging from 1.0 to 31 mg l(-1). conclusions: the eucalyptus extracts and three compounds from e. maculata were found to be effective against  micro-organisms that cause food poisoning, acne and athlete's foot. significance  and impact of the study: this study shows potential uses of extracts from e. globulus, e. maculata and e. viminalis, and antimicrobial compounds isolated from e. maculata.

TI  == a comparison of the bacteria found on the hands of 'homemakers' and neonatal intensive care unit nurses.
AB  == this prevalence study was conducted to compare the counts, types and antimicrobial resistance profiles of bacterial flora on the hands of individuals  in the community to that of nurses at a nearby university teaching hospital, with an intense hand hygiene regimen. hand cultures were obtained from 204 individuals during a home visit and 119 nurses in two neonatal intensive care units (nicus).  the mean total log counts of organisms were 5.73 and 5.24 for the homemakers [defined as the person (usually the mother) who is the primary person responsible for arranging childcare, cooking, cleaning etc] and nurse hands, respectively (p<0.0001). significantly more homemakers had acinetobacter lwoffii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. fluorescens/putida, and staphylococcus aureus on their hands compared with the nurses (all p<0.05). however, significantly more nurses had enterococcus faecalis, s. epidermidis, and s. warneri on their hands (p<0.05). of note, the hands of nurses harboured significantly more s. epidermidis strains resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and oxacillin and s. warneri resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, and oxacillin (p<0.05). surprisingly, significantly more trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant s. epidermidis and ciprofloxacin-resistant s. warneri was recovered from the hands of homemakers (p<0.05). this study demonstrates differences in prevalence, bacterial composition and antimicrobial resistance of hand flora of hospital personnel compared with homemakers. moreover, the hands of homemakers may serve as community reservoirs for antimicrobial resistant strains of clinical importance.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == transformation of bacteria with plasmid dna by electroporation.
AB  == the possibility of electric field-mediated transformation ("electroporation") of  a gram-positive bacterium (enterococcus faecalis) and two gram-negative bacteria  (escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida) with plasmid dna was investigated. e. faecalis protoplasts could be transformed by electroporation with a transformation frequency of 10(4) to 10(5) transformants/micrograms plasmid. untreated--i.e., washed--cells of e. coli could be transformed with rates of 1 x  10(5) transformants/micrograms plasmid dna. transformation rates for p. putida cells were up to 3 x 10(4) if the method developed for e. coli was used. detailed protocols for these systems, including the results of various optimization experiments, are given.

TI  == [ability to survive and interactions of selected bacterial species in activated carbon filters].
AB  == the survival and the interactions of selected, hygienically relevant bacterial species in activated carbon filters was investigated. the numbers of escherichia  coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and p. putida increased in previously sterilized filters. after inoculation all bacteria (10(6] were adsorbed. during a period of  6-10 days the filter effluent contained no detectable bacteria. after that the colony numbers increased to a constant level of 10(4)-10(5) colony forming units  (cfu)/ml effluent and 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g activated carbon. klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis died off in the filter system. if the filters were inoculated simultaneously with two species, p. putida and p. aeruginosa remained  at a constant level between 10(4) and 10(5) cfu/ml. e. coli was suppressed by p.  aeruginosa and died off in the presence of p. putida. as in-vitro tests indicated, p. putida did not produce inhibitory substances against p. aeruginosa  or e. coli. on the other hand, p. aeruginosa showed antagonistic activities against e. coli.
