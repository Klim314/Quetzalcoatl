effect of supplementation of micronutrients and phytochemicals to fructooligosaccharides on growth response of probiotics and e. coli.
probiotics and prebiotics, which can change the colonic microenvironment, are the areas of current interest.
unutilizable fractions of the foods and fortificants, which reach the colon can affect the profile of probiotics.
effects of eight such factors viz.
zinc sulphate, zinc carbonate, ferrous sulphate, ferric citrate, quercetin, gallic acid, phytic acid, and oxalic acid were, therefore, investigated on 24 h growth of lactobacillus acidophilus (l1) and lactobacillus plantarum (l2), two isolates of bifidobacteria (longum (l3) and bifidum (l4)) and a marketed consortium (l5) of eight probiotic cultures.
mrs medium with marketed fructooligosaccharide as the only source of carbon was used for study of dose response curves.
quercetin and zinc sulphate showed significant positive effect for l1 and l5 (p < 0.01), whereas there was slight positive effect or no effect on growth of other probiotics.
phytic acid showed a significant inhibitory effect for l2 and a slight inhibitory effect on l3 and l4 whereas l5 were able to tolerate phytic acid.
oxalic acid had slight positive effect for l1 (p < 0.05) and l5 and no effect on growth of other probiotics (p > 0.05).
further, zinc sulphate, ferrous sulphate, quercetin, and oxalic acid significantly inhibited growth of e. coli (p < 0.05)
