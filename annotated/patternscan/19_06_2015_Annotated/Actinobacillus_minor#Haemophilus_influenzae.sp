TI  == molecular signatures (conserved indels) in protein sequences that are specific for the order pasteurellales and distinguish two of its main clades.
AB  == the members of the order pasteurellales are currently distinguished primarily on  the basis of their branching in the rrna trees and no convincing biochemical or molecular markers are known that distinguish them from all other bacteria. the genome sequences for 20 pasteurellaceae species/strains are now publicly available. we report here detailed analyses of protein sequences from these genomes to identify conserved signature indels (csis) that are specific for either all pasteurellales or its major clades. we describe more than 23 csis in widely distributed genes/proteins that are uniquely shared by all sequenced pasteurellaceae species/strains but are not found in any other bacteria. twenty-one additional csis are also specific for the pasteurellales except in some of these cases homologues were not detected in a few species or the csi was  also present in an isolated non-pasteurellaceae species. the sequenced pasteurellaceae species formed two distinct clades in a phylogenetic tree based upon concatenated sequences for 10 conserved proteins. the first of these clades  consisting of aggregatibacter, pasteurella, actinobacillus succinogenes, mannheimia succiniciproducens, haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus somnus was  also independently supported by 13 uniquely shared csis that are not present in other pasteurellaceae species or other bacteria. another clade consisting of the  remaining pasteurellaceae species (viz. actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, actinobacillus minor, haemophilus ducryi, mannheimia haemolytica and haemophilus  parasuis) was also strongly and independently supported by nine csis that are uniquely present in these bacteria. the order pasteurellales is presently made up of a single family, pasteurellaceae, that encompasses all of its genera. in this  context, our identification of two distinct clades within the pasteurellales, which are supported by both phylogenetic analyses and by multiple highly specific molecular markers, strongly argues for and provides potential means for the division of various genera from this order into a minimum of two families. the genetic changes responsible for these csis were likely introduced in the common ancestors of either all pasteurellales or of these two specific clades. these csis provide novel means for the identification and circumscription of these groups of pasteurellales in molecular terms.

TI  == sequence analysis of serotype-specific synthesis regions ii of haemophilus influenzae serotypes c and d: evidence for common ancestry of capsule synthesis in pasteurellaceae and neisseria meningitidis.
AB  == sequencing of yet unknown haemophilus influenzae serotype c (hic) and d (hid) capsule synthesis regions ii revealed four (ccs1-4) and five (dcs1-5) open reading frames, respectively. the inferred gene functions were in line with capsular polysaccharide structures. one or more proteins encoded by the hic capsule synthesis region ii showed similarity to actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae  serotype 1 and actinobacillus suis k1 enzymes. orthologues to the complete operon were observed in actinobacillus minor strain 202, where even the gene order was conserved. furthermore, ccs4 was related to the capsule o-acetyltransferase of neisseria meningitidis serogroup w-135. for the hid locus, similarities to hie, mannheimia haemolytica a1 and n. meningitidis serogroup a were identified and the succession of genes was similar in the different species. the resemblance of genes and gene organization found for hic and hid with other species suggested horizontal gene transfer during capsule evolution across the bacterial classes.

TI  == conserved interaction between transferrin and transferrin-binding proteins from porcine pathogens.
AB  == gram-negative porcine pathogens from the pasteurellaceae family possess a surface receptor complex capable of acquiring iron from porcine transferrin (ptf). this receptor consists of transferrin-binding protein a (tbpa), a transmembrane iron transporter, and tbpb, a surface-exposed lipoprotein. questions remain as to how  the receptor complex engages ptf in such a way that iron is positioned for release, and whether divergent strains present distinct recognition sites on tf.  in this study, the tbpb-ptf interface was mapped using a combination of mass shift analysis and molecular docking simulations, localizing binding uniquely to  the ptf c lobe for multiple divergent strains of actinobacillus plueropneumoniae  and suis. the interface was further characterized and validated with site-directed mutagenesis. although targeting a common lobe, variants differ in preference for the two sublobes comprising the iron coordination site. sublobes c1 and c2 participate in high affinity binding, but sublobe c1 contributes in a minor fashion to the overall affinity. further, the tbpb-ptf complex does not release iron independent of other mediators, based on competitive iron binding studies. together, our findings support a model whereby tbpb efficiently captures and presents iron-loaded ptf to other elements of the uptake pathway, even under  low iron conditions.

TI  == the transferrin receptor of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae: quantitation of expression and structural characterization using a peptide-specific monoclonal antibody.
AB  == when actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (a. pp) is grown under iron-restricted conditions in vitro, transferrin binding proteins (tbps) are induced. the functional transferrin receptor of a. pp is composed of two outer membrane proteins (tbp1 and tbp2) and shows an exquisite specificity for porcine transferrin. this complex was studied using a monoclonal antibody (mab 1.48) raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to a hydrophilic domain of tbp2  common to several a. pp serotypes. the antibody reacted specifically with a 60-70kda tbp2-antigen found in all serotypes of a. pp obtained from iron-restricted culture. it was found that tbp2 was not expressed in iron replete medium by any serotype except serotypes 5a, 5b and 6 where a weak expression was  seen. there was a weak expression of related antigens in actinobacillus indolicus and actinobacillus suis under iron-depleted conditions while no similar antigens  were detected with the mab in iron-starved actinobacillus lignieresii, actinobacillus porcinus, actinobacillus minor, haemophilus influenzae, and haemophilus parasuis. using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) based on the mab 1.48, tbp2 could be detected in both recombinant e. coli expressing tbp2  and in wild type a. pp grown under iron restricted conditions. the subcellular location of tbp2 in a. pp was studied by immunoelectron microscopy using the mab  1.48. interestingly, all antibody binding was found inside the a. pp cells, while tbp2 expressed in recombinant e. coli was found both in the cytosol and on the outer membrane. these results indicate that the mab 1.48-reactive epitope of tbp2 is surface exposed when it is expressed without tbp1 in e. coli while the inaccessibility of this epitope of tbp2 in a. pp could be due to shading by the association between tbp2 and tbp1.

TI  == phylogeny of 54 representative strains of species in the family pasteurellaceae as determined by comparison of 16s rrna sequences.
AB  == virtually complete 16s rrna sequences were determined for 54 representative strains of species in the family pasteurellaceae. of these strains, 15 were pasteurella, 16 were actinobacillus, and 23 were haemophilus. a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on sequence similarity, using the neighbor-joining method.  fifty-three of the strains fell within four large clusters. the first cluster included the type strains of haemophilus influenzae, h. aegyptius, h. aphrophilus, h. haemolyticus, h. paraphrophilus, h. segnis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. this cluster also contained a. actinomycetemcomitans fdc y4, atcc 29522, atcc 29523, and atcc 29524 and h. aphrophilus nctc 7901. the second cluster included the type strains of a. seminis and pasteurella aerogenes  and h. somnus ovcg 43826. the third cluster was composed of the type strains of pasteurella multocida, p. anatis, p. avium, p. canis, p. dagmatis, p. gallinarum, p. langaa, p. stomatis, p. volantium, h. haemoglobinophilus, h. parasuis, h. paracuniculus, h. paragallinarum, and a. capsulatus. this cluster also contained  pasteurella species a ccug 18782, pasteurella species b ccug 19974, haemophilus taxon c capm 5111, h. parasuis type 5 nagasaki, p. volantium (h. parainfluenzae)  nctc 4101, and p. trehalosi nctc 10624. the fourth cluster included the type strains of actinobacillus lignieresii, a. equuli, a. pleuropneumoniae, a. suis, a. ureae, h. parahaemolyticus, h. parainfluenzae, h. paraphrohaemolyticus, h. ducreyi, and p. haemolytica. this cluster also contained actinobacillus species strain ccug 19799 (bisgaard taxon 11), a. suis atcc 15557, h. ducreyi atcc 27722  and hd 35000, haemophilus minor group strain 202, and h. parainfluenzae atcc 29242. the type strain of p. pneumotropica branched alone to form a fifth group.  the branching of the pasteurellaceae family tree was quite complex. the four major clusters contained multiple subclusters. the clusters contained both rapidly and slowly evolving strains (indicated by differing numbers of base changes incorporated into the 16s rrna sequence relative to outgroup organisms).  while the results presented a clear picture of the phylogenetic relationships, the complexity of the branching will make division of the family into genera a difficult and somewhat subjective task. we do not suggest any taxonomic changes at this time.
