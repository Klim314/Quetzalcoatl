TI  - Selection of potential probiotic lactobacilli from pig feces to be used as additives in pelleted feeding.
AB  - Thirty-five isolates from pig feces were identified as Lactobacillus reuteri (12  strains), Lactobacillus mucosae (7), Lactobacillus plantarum (6), Lactobacillus kitasatonis (3), Lactobacillus rossiae (2), Lactobacillus ultunensis (2), Lactobacillus crispatus (2), and Lactobacillus intestinalis (1) by partial sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA. All isolates were detected at 8-9 log CFU g(-1). Preliminarily, strains were selected based on resistance to heat treatments (ca. 70 degrees C for 10 s). The decrease in viability for some L. reuteri, L. mucosae, L. plantarum, L. kitasatonis, and L. rossiae strains was lower than 1 log cycle. Selected strains were further characterized for acid and bile salt resistance, and antibacterial activity. Except for L. kitasatonis, tolerance to simulated gastric and intestinal conditions was enhanced for all strains by addition of reconstituted skimmed milk. Antibacterial activity was found against Gram-positive and -negative potential pathogens. L. reuteri 8.1, 3S7, 6.2, and 1.2, L. mucosae 1.1R, L. plantarum 4.1, and L. rossiae 4.4 were freeze-dried and mixed (1%, w/w) into pig feed before pelleting. After pelleting, pig feed contained 10-9 log CFU kg(-1) of lactobacilli. L. plantarum 4.1, and L. reuteri 3S7 were selected based on their bile salt resistance, pH tolerance, antimicrobial activity and heat resistance. The findings in this study provide a strong basis for exploring the potential of porcine lactobacilli isolates to be used in pelleted feeding as probiotic additives.
TI  - Quantitative analysis of diverse Lactobacillus species present in advanced dental caries.
AB  - Our previous analysis of 65 advanced dental caries lesions by traditional culture techniques indicated that lactobacilli were numerous in the advancing front of the progressive lesion. Production of organic acids by lactobacilli is considered to be important in causing decalcification of the dentinal matrix. The present study was undertaken to define more precisely the diversity of lactobacilli found in this environment and to quantify the major species and phylotypes relative to total load of lactobacilli by real-time PCR. Pooled DNA was amplified by PCR with Lactobacillus genus-specific primers for subsequent cloning, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. Based on 16S ribosomal DNA sequence comparisons, 18 different phylotypes of lactobacilli were detected, including strong representation of both novel and gastrointestinal phylotypes. Specific PCR primers were designed for nine prominent species, including Lactobacillus gasseri, L. ultunensis, L. salivarius, L. rhamnosus, L. casei, L. crispatus, L. delbrueckii, L. fermentum, and L. gallinarum. More than three different species were identified as being present in most of the dentine samples, confirming the widespread distribution and numerical importance of various Lactobacillus spp. in carious dentine. Quantification by real-time PCR revealed various proportions of the nine species colonizing carious dentine, with higher mean loads of L. gasseri and L. ultunensis than of the other prevalent species. The findings provide a basis for further characterization of the pathogenicity of Lactobacillus spp. in the context of extension of the carious lesion.
