TI  == in vitro activities of faropenem against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of faropenem, a new oral penem, was tested against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria by using the nccls-approved reference method. drugs tested included amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, clindamycin, faropenem, imipenem, and metronidazole. of the 176 strains of bacteroides fragilis group isolates tested, two isolates had faropenem mics of 64 micro g/ml and imipenem mics of >32 micro g/ml. faropenem had an mic of 16 micro g/ml for an additional isolate of b. fragilis; this strain was sensitive to imipenem (mic of 1 micro g/ml). both faropenem and imipenem had mics of < or=4 micro g/ml for all isolates of bacteroides capillosus (10 isolates), bacteroides splanchnicus (13 isolates), bacteroides ureolyticus (11 isolates), bilophila wadsworthia (11 isolates), porphyromonas species (42 isolates), prevotella species (78 isolates), campylobacter species (25 isolates), sutterella wadsworthensis (11 isolates), fusobacterium nucleatum (19 isolates), fusobacterium mortiferum/varium (20 isolates), and other fusobacterium species (9 isolates). faropenem and imipenem had mics of 16 to 32 micro g/ml for two strains of clostridium difficile; the mics for all other strains of clostridium tested (69 isolates) were < or =4 micro g/ml. faropenem had mics of 8 and 16 micro g/ml, respectively, for two strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius (mics of imipenem were 2 micro g/ml). mics were < or =4 micro g/ml for all other strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci (53 isolates) and non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (28 isolates). other results were as expected and reported in previous studies. no metronidazole resistance was seen in gram-negative anaerobes other than s. wadsworthensis (18% resistant); 63% of gram-positive non-spore-forming rods were resistant. some degree of clindamycin resistance was seen in most of the groups tested.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of non-bacteroides fragilis group anaerobic gram-negative bacilli in europe.
AB  == objective: to investigate the in vitro activity of a range of anti-anaerobe antimicrobials against non-bacteroides fragilis group anaerobic gram-negative bacilli isolated in europe. methods: isolates from 15 laboratories in 13 countries were identified by conventional methods. the mics of 20 antibiotics were determined by an agar dilution method. results: there were 488 prevotella spp., 174 fusobacteria, 69 porphyromonas spp., 33 bacteroides spp., 28 bilophila  wadsworthia and 16 campylobacter spp. isolates, one sutterella wadsworthensis isolate and four unidentified isolates. penicillin resistance (and diminished susceptibility to piperacillin) was most common in prevotella spp. and bilophila  wadsworthia but was also seen in many other species. all isolates, except three of bilophila wadsworthia, were susceptible to amoxycillin/clavulanate. most isolates were susceptible to cefoxitin (except bilophila wadsworthia) and all were susceptible to the carbapenems. clinafloxacin was the most active quinolone, followed by trovafloxacin and then sparfloxacin. most fusobacteria were inherently resistant to the macrolides, as expected, but resistance to macrolides and a ketolide in other species was uncommon. most fusobacterium varium isolates  were resistant to clindamycin, but resistance to clindamycin in all other species was rare. tetracycline resistance was common but this did not affect the glycylcyclines. there was one isolate of bacteroides putredinis resistant to chloramphenicol, and three isolates, a bacteroides ureolyticus isolate, the sutterella wadsworthensis isolate and one of the unnamed isolates, were metronidazole resistant. rifampicin was active against most prevotella and porphyromonas spp., but not against many other genera. conclusions: penicillin resistance has increased in europe among non-bacteroides fragilis anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, much of it due to beta-lactamase. acquired resistance to other beta-lactams, macrolides and rifampicin has not significantly increased, and chloramphenicol and metronidazole are unaffected. however, resistance to tetracycline is common. the new compounds, a ketolide (hmr 3647), the glycylcyclines and clinafloxacin, are highly active.

TI  == recently described clinically important anaerobic bacteria: taxonomic aspects and update.
AB  == a new method of identifying bacteria, phylogenetic 16s rrna sequencing, has led to major reorganizations among most genera of anaerobic bacteria. the pigmented prevotella species now comprise seven species including p. nigrescens and p. tannerae; p. intermedia/p. nigrescens-like organisms await inclusion. the former  mitsuokella dentalis and hallella seregens were transferred to prevotella as one  species, p. dentalis. p. enoeca is a new nonpigmenting prevotella. the genus porphyromonas currently includes 11 pigmented species and one nonpigmented species, p. catoniae; p. levii-like and p. endodontalis-like organisms are candidates for the genus. fusobacterium nucleatum currently has five subspecies,  and f. varium includes the former f. pseudonecrophorum. former wolinella recta and wolinella curva now are campylobacter rectus and campylobacter curvus; campylobacter showae is a new species. isolates included in the bile-sensitive former bacteroides gracilis now are campylobacter gracilis; the bile-resistant b. gracilis isolates were transferred to a new genus, sutterella, as s. wadsworthensis. the new actinomyces species include two subspecies of the a. neuii and the a. radingae-a. turicensis complex. the genus eubacterium sensu stricto is represented by e. limosum, and the former e. alactolyticum was reclassified in a new genus, pseudoramibacter, as p. alactolyticus. recent entries include e. saphenum, e. minutum, e. exiguum, e. infirmum, and e. tardum.  a new genus, atopobium houses some former lactobacilli and streptococci. the genus peptostreptococcus also have four new species; p. hydrogenalis, p. lacrimalis, p. lactolyticus, and p. vaginalis.
