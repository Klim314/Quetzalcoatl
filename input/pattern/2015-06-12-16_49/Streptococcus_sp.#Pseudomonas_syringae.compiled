TI  - Novel bacterial ADP-ribosylating toxins: structure and function.
AB  - Bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferase toxins (bARTTs) transfer ADP-ribose to eukaryotic proteins to promote bacterial pathogenesis. In this Review, we use prototype bARTTs, such as diphtheria toxin and pertussis toxin, as references for the characterization of several new bARTTs from human, insect and plant pathogens, which were recently identified by bioinformatic analyses. Several of these toxins, including cholix toxin (ChxA) from Vibrio cholerae, SpyA from Streptococcus pyogenes, HopU1 from Pseudomonas syringae and the Tcc toxins from Photorhabdus luminescens, ADP-ribosylate novel substrates and have unique organizations, which distinguish them from the reference toxins. The characterization of these toxins increases our appreciation of the range of structural and functional properties that are possessed by bARTTs and their roles in bacterial pathogenesis.
TI  - Robustness assessment of whole bacterial genome segmentations.
AB  - Comparison of closely related bacterial genomes has revealed the presence of highly conserved sequences forming a "backbone" that is interrupted by numerous, less conserved, DNA fragments. Segmentation of bacterial genomes into backbone and variable regions is particularly useful to investigate, among other things, bacterial genome evolution. Several software tools have been designed to compare complete bacterial chromosomes and a few online databases store pre-computed genome comparisons. However, very few statistical methods are available to evaluate the reliability of these software tools and to compare the results obtained with them. To fill this gap, we have developed two local scores to measure the robustness of bacterial genome segmentations. Our method uses a simulation procedure based on random perturbations of the compared genomes. The two scores described in this article provide useful information and are easy to implement, and their interpretation is intuitive. We show that they are suited to discriminate between robust and non-robust segmentations when genome aligners such as MAUVE and MGA are used.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of extracts of chemical races of the lichen Pseudevernia furfuracea and their physodic acid, chloroatranorin, atranorin, and olivetoric acid constituents.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity and the MIC values of the ethanol, chloroform, diethyl ether, and acetone extracts of the chemical races of Pseudevernia furfuracea (var. furfuracea and var. ceratea) and their physodic acid, chloroatranorin, atranorin, and olivetoric acid constituents have been investigated against some microorganisms. Nearly all extracts of both chemical races showed antimicrobial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Alternaria alternata, Ascochyta rabiei, Aspergillus niger, Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium moniliforme, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium solani, and Penicillium notatum. There was no antimicrobial activity of the extracts against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas syringae, Salmonella typhimurium, Alternaria citri, Alternaria tenuissima, and Gaeumannomyces graminis. Chloroatranorin and olivetoric acid were active against the same microorganisms with few exceptions. Physodic acid was active against about the same bacteria and yeasts and inactive against all of the filamentous fungi tested. Also no activity of atranorin against the filamentous fungi was observed.
TI  - Plasmid pIP501 encoded transcriptional repressor CopR binds asymmetrically at two consecutive major grooves of the DNA.
AB  - Replication of the streptococcal plasmid pIP501 is regulated by the CopR protein  and an antisense-RNA (RNAIII). CopR acts as transcriptional repressor at the essential repR promoter pII by binding to inverted repeat IR1 upstream of pII. To further characterize the interaction of CopR with its target, footprinting studies were performed. Methylation interference identified three guanine bases (G240, G242 and G251) in the top strand and two (G252 and G254) in the bottom strand contacted by CopR in the major groove of the DNA. Missing base interference revealed the contribution of the bases in the neighbourhood of these guanine bases to the specific DNA-protein contacts. Phosphate residues essential for CopR binding were determined by ethylation interference. The recognition sequence was localized at the centre of inverted repeat IR1. CopR contacts two consecutive major grooves (site I and II) on the same face of the DNA. Although the two sites share a common sequence motif, neighbouring bases are contacted differently. DNA fragments carrying single mutations in site I or II were analysed by band shift assays. Gel filtration and native gel electrophoresis demonstrated that CopR exists only as a dimer. A sigmoidal binding curve of CopR to its DNA target was observed and allowed the determination of the apparent dissociation constant K(D). The significance of the relatively high apparent K(D) for the role of CopR in pIP501 copy number regulation is discussed.
TI  - Distribution of epiphytic bacteria on olive leaves and the influence of leaf age  and sampling time.
AB  - Mesophilic heterotrophic, aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria that grow on yeast tryptone glucose extract agar were isolated from the surface of olive leaves of 3 or 4 different ages in January, April, July, and October from 1984 to 1989. Unweighted average linkage cluster analysis on either the Jaccard coefficient or the simple matching coefficient recovered 1,701 representative strains in 32 phena defined at the 70% and 80% similarity level, respectively. Of these, 25 were identified to genus or lower level. From the identity of the representative strains, the frequency of occurrence among the phylloplane bacteria over the 6-year period was estimated at 51% forPseudomonas syringae, followed byXanthomonas campestris (6.7%),Erwinia herbicola (6%),Acetobacter aceti (4.7%),Gluconobacter oxydans (4.3%),Pseudomonas fluorescens (3.9%),Bacillus megaterium (3.8%),Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp.dextranicum (3.1%),Lactobacillus plantarum (2.8%),Curtobacterium plantarum (2.2%),Micrococcus luteus (2.2%),Arthrobacter globiformis (1.4%),Klebsiella planticola (1.2%),Streptococcus faecium (1.2%),Clavibacter sp. (0.98%),Micrococcus sp. (0.82%),Serratia marcescens (0.81%),Bacillus subtilis (0.57%),Cellulomonas flavigena (0.4%),Erwinia sp. (0.37%),Zymomonas mobilis (0.3%),Bacillus sp. (0.29%),Alcaligenes faecalis (0.27%),Erwinia carotovora (0.08%), andPseudomonas aeruginosa (0.04%). Bacterial communities on leaves of a given age at a given time during any one year displayed a very similar structure but differed significantly from those on the leaves of the same age at a different time or on the leaves of a different age at any time during any one year. Communities on the leaves of a given age at a given time of the year were invariably dominated by one or another of only 9 taxa, which accounted for 22 to 98.5% of the isolates from those leaves. The communities on 10- and 13-month-old leaves were invariably made up of fewer taxa than those on younger leaves at the same time of the year.
