TI  == [role of obligate anaerobes in infections in hospitalized patients and therapeutic options].
AB  == monitoring of prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of strictly anaerobic bacteria, causing infections in hospitalized patients, constitutes a part of a program for prudent use of antibiotics. the aim of the study was to assess prevalence of strictly anaerobic bacteria in patients hospitalized in a tertiary  care hospital in 2001-2002 with reference to empiric antibiotic therapy. the most common gram-positive bacteria were clostridium difficile--27.7%, peptostreptococcus spp. and peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus--21.9% and actinomyces spp.--11.1%. there was an increase in the number of stool samples positive for c. difficile toxins a and b from 39.4% in 2001 to 59.0% in 2002. the results of susceptibility testing of gram-positive isolates showed the highest percentages of strains susceptible to piperacilin/tazobactam--99.6%, ticarcillin/clavulanate--98.5%, imipenem--98.5%, amoxicillin/clavulanate--97.4% and piperacillin--97.4%. the most prevalent gram-negative anaerobes were strains  of bacteroides spp.--43.1%, prevotella spp.--35.8% and fusobacterium spp.--11.0%. all tested strains of gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to metronidazole, piperacilin/tazobactam, ticarcillin/clavulanate and imipenem. in the analyzed population beta-lactam antibiotics with beta-lactamase inhibitors, carbapenems and metronidazole may be used in empiric therapy of infections caused by strictly anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == in vitro activities of the new semisynthetic glycopeptide telavancin (td-6424), vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, and four comparator agents against anaerobic gram-positive species and corynebacterium spp.
AB  == telavancin is a new semisynthetic glycopeptide anti-infective with multiple mechanisms of action, including inhibition of bacterial membrane phospholipid synthesis and inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. we determined the in vitro activities of telavancin, vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ampicillin against 268 clinical isolates of anaerobic gram-positive organisms and 31 corynebacterium strains using agar dilution methods according to national committee for clinical laboratory standards procedures. plates with daptomycin were supplemented with ca(2+) to 50 mg/liter. the mics at which 90% of isolates tested were inhibited (mic(90)s) for telavancin and vancomycin were as follows: actinomyces spp. (n = 45), 0.25 and 1 microg/ml, respectively; clostridium difficile (n = 14), 0.25 and 1 microg/ml, respectively; clostridium ramosum (n =  16), 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; clostridium innocuum (n = 15), 4 and 16 microg/ml, respectively; clostridium clostridioforme (n = 15), 8 and 1 microg/ml, respectively; eubacterium group (n = 33), 0.25 and 2 microg/ml, respectively; lactobacillus spp. (n = 26), 0.5 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; propionibacterium spp. (n = 34), 0.125 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively; peptostreptococcus spp. (n  = 52), 0.125 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively; and corynebacterium spp. (n = 31),  0.03 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. the activity of td-6424 was similar to that of quinupristin-dalfopristin for most strains except c. clostridioforme and lactobacillus casei, where quinupristin-dalfopristin was three- to fivefold more  active. daptomycin had decreased activity (mic > 4 microg/ml) against 14 strains  of actinomyces spp. and all c. ramosum, eubacterium lentum, and lactobacillus plantarum strains. linezolid showed decreased activity (mic > 4 microg/ml) against c. ramosum, two strains of c. difficile, and 15 strains of lactobacillus  spp. imipenem and piperacillin-tazobactam were active against >98% of strains. the mics of ampicillin for eight clostridium spp. and three strains of l. casei were >1 microg/ml. the mic(90) of td-6424 for all strains tested was </=2 microg/ml. td-6424 has potential for use against infections with gram-positive anaerobes and deserves further clinical evaluation.

TI  == in vitro activities of ramoplanin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, linezolid, bacitracin, and four other antimicrobials against intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == by using an agar dilution method, the in vitro activities of ramoplanin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, linezolid, and five other agents were determined against 300 gram-positive and 54 gram-negative strains of intestinal anaerobes. ramoplanin was active at <or=2 microg/ml against 287 of 300 (95.7%) gram-positive organisms, including 18 strains of clostridium difficile for which mics of ramoplanin were 0.25 to 0.5 microg/ml; for 3 of these, linezolid mics were 8 to 16 micro g/ml. nineteen clostridium innocuum strains for which the vancomycin mic at which 90% of strains were inhibited was 16 microg/ml were susceptible to ramoplanin at 0.06 to 0.25 microg/ml and to teicoplanin at 0.125 to 1.0 microg/ml. all strains of eubacterium, actinomyces, propionibacterium, and peptostreptococcus spp. were inhibited by <or=0.25 microg of ramoplanin per ml and <or=1 microg of vancomycin per ml. ramoplanin was also active at <or=4 microg/ml against 15 of 22 of the prevotella and porphyromonas strains tested, but ramoplanin mics for all 31 strains of the bacteroides fragilis group, the fusobacterium mortiferum-fusobacterium varium group, and veillonella spp. were >or=256 microg/ml. ramoplanin displays excellent activity against c. difficile and other gram-positive enteric anaerobes, including vancomycin-resistant strains; however, it has poor activity against most gram-negative anaerobes and thus potentially has a lesser effect on the ecological balance of normal fecal flora.

TI  == in vitro activities of dalbavancin and nine comparator agents against anaerobic gram-positive species and corynebacteria.
AB  == dalbavancin is a novel semisynthetic glycopeptide with enhanced activity against  gram-positive species. its comparative in vitro activities and those of nine comparator agents, including daptomycin, vancomycin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin, against 290 recent gram-positive clinical isolates strains, as determined by the nccls agar dilution method, were studied. the mics  of dalbavancin at which 90% of various isolates tested were inhibited were as follows: actinomyces spp., 0.5 microg/ml; clostridium clostridioforme, 8 microg/ml; c. difficile, 0.25 microg/ml; c. innocuum, 0.25 microg/ml; c. perfringens, 0.125 microg/ml; c. ramosum, 1 microg/ml; eubacterium spp., 1 microg/ml; lactobacillus spp., >32 microg/ml, propionibacterium spp., 0.5 microg/ml; and peptostreptococcus spp., 0.25 microg/ml. dalbavancin was 1 to 3 dilutions more active than vancomycin against most strains. dalbavancin exhibited excellent activity against gram-positive strains tested and warrants clinical evaluation.

TI  == in vitro activities of daptomycin, vancomycin, quinupristin- dalfopristin, linezolid, and five other antimicrobials against 307 gram-positive anaerobic and  31 corynebacterium clinical isolates.
AB  == the activities of daptomycin, a cyclic lipopeptide, and eight other agents were determined against 338 strains of gram-positive anaerobic bacteria and corynebacteria by the nccls reference agar dilution method with supplemented brucella agar for the anaerobes and mueller-hinton agar for the corynebacteria. the daptomycin mics determined on ca(2+)-supplemented (50 mg/liter) brucella agar plates were one- to fourfold lower than those determined in unsupplemented media. daptomycin was highly active (mics, <or=2 microg/ml) against many strains including 36 of 37 peptostreptococci, 37 of 48 isolates of the eubacterium group, and all strains of propionibacterium spp., clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile, and other clostridium spp. it was fourfold or greater more active than vancomycin against clostridium innocuum and 16 of 34 strains of vancomycin-resistant lactobacilli. three strains of c. difficile for which quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid mics were >8 microg/ml were inhibited by  <1 microg of daptomycin per ml. daptomycin mics were >or=4 microg/ml for most strains of clostridium clostridioforme, clostridium paraputrificum, clostridium tertium, and clostridium ramosum; the isolates were generally more resistant to other antimicrobials. daptomycin was two- to fourfold less active against actinomyces spp. than vancomycin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, or linezolid. twenty-nine of 31 strains of corynebacterium spp., including corynebacterium jeikeium, corynebacterium amycolatum, and corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, were inhibited by <or=0.25 microg of daptomycin per ml. for two strains of "corynebacterium aquaticum," 8 microg of daptomycin per ml was required for inhibition. daptomycin demonstrated very good activities against a broad range of gram-positive organisms including vancomycin-resistant c. innocuum and lactobacillus strains and quinupristin-dalfopristin- and linezolid-resistant c. difficile strains.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of abt-773 against 362 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of abt-773, a novel ketolide antibiotic, against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined and compared to the activities of other antimicrobial agents. mics at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=0.06 microg/ml for actinomyces spp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus spp., propionibacterium spp., and porphyromonas spp. the mic(50)s and mic(90)s were </=0.06 and >32 microg/ml, respectively, for eubacterium spp., lactobacillus spp., clostridium difficile, and clostridium ramosum. the mic(90) for bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides ureolyticus, and campylobacter gracilis was 1 microg/ml, and that for prevotella bivia and other prevotella spp. was 0.5 microg/ml. the mic(90) for fusobacterium nucleatum was 8  microg/ml, and that for fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium varium was >32 microg/ml. the mic(90)s for the bacteroides fragilis group were as follows: for b. fragilis, 8 microg/ml; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides distasonis, and bacteroides uniformis, >32 microg/ml; and for bacteroides vulgatus, 4 microg/ml. telithromycin mics for the b. fragilis group were usually 1 to 2 dilutions higher than abt-773 mics. for all strains, abt-773  was more active than erythromycin by 4 or more dilutions, and for some strains this drug was more active than clindamycin.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 gram-positive microorganisms. the mic(90) (mg/l) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus anginosus and actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for streptococcus sanguis and listeria monocytogenes, 2 for corynebacterium jekeium and bifidobacterium bivius. over 50% of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium,  quinolone-resistant staphylococci, nocardia steroides and clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/l moxifloxacin. moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against gram-positive bacilli.

TI  == activities of gemifloxacin (sb 265805, lb20304) compared to those of other oral antimicrobial agents against unusual anaerobes.
AB  == the activities of gemifloxacin (sb 265805, lb20304) and comparator agents were determined by an agar dilution method against 419 clinical strains of less-commonly identified species of anaerobes. gemifloxacin was generally more active than trovafloxacin against gram-positive strains by one to two dilutions.  peptostreptococci (peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, peptostreptococcus magnus, peptostreptococcus micros, and peptostreptococcus prevotii) and porphyromonas spp. (porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas canoris, porphyromonas gingivalis, and porphyromonas macacae) were all susceptible to </=0.25 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml. the mics of gemifloxacin at which 90% of the following strains were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=2 microgram/ml: actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, clostridium innocuum, clostridium clostridioforme, anaerobiospirillum spp., bacteroides tectum, bacteroides ureolyticus, bacteroides gracilis (now campylobacter gracilis), prevotella intermedia, prevotella heparinolytica, and the prevotella oris-buccae  group. fusobacterium naviforme and fusobacterium necrophorum were also susceptible to </=2 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml, while fusobacterium varium  strains exhibited a bimodal pattern; the other fusobacterium species, such as fusobacterium ulcerans and fusobacterium russii, as well as veillonella spp., the prevotella melaninogenica group, prevotella bivia, clostridium difficile, and bilophila wadsworthia were relatively resistant to gemifloxacin (mic(90)s, >/=4 microgram/ml).

TI  == in vitro activities of daptomycin (ly146032) and paldimycin (u-70,138f) against anaerobic gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activities of daptomycin (ly146032), paldimycin (u-70,138f), vancomycin, and penicillin g against 344 clinical isolates of anaerobic gram-positive bacteria were determined by an agar dilution method in calcium-supplemented (50 micrograms/ml) wilkins-chalgren medium, using an inoculum of 10(5) cfu. daptomycin demonstrated excellent activity against a broad range of anaerobic gram-positive cocci and bacilli, including peptostreptococcus, eubacterium, bifidobacterium, actinomyces, propionibacterium, and lactobacillus species and clostridium difficile. highly resistant strains (mic, greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml) were encountered sporadically from different genera, but these accounted for only 3% of all isolates tested. vancomycin showed similar activity but was less active against lactobacillus species and peptostreptococcus prevotii. paldimycin was inactive against most genera of anaerobic gram-positive  bacteria. overall, penicillin g remained the most broadly active agent against these isolates.

TI  == in vitro activity of imipenem against gram-positive anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activity of imipenem, a new penem antibiotic, was determined against 210 clinical gram-positive anaerobic isolates and compared with the activities of metronidazole, clindamycin, cefoxitin, moxalactam, ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone and cefotiam. all investigated strains were inhibited by a 4-mg/l concentration of imipenem. cefoxitin demonstrated good activity against most strains with exception of some clostridium difficile and clostridium ramosum strains. cephalosporins were classed in decreasing activity order as follows: cefoxitin moxalactam ceftriaxone ceftizoxime cefotiam. metronidazole had better activity against clostridium spp. than against non-sporulated bacilli. clindamycin resistance rates were superior to 10% for most groups, with the exception of clostridium perfringens. actinomyces and bifidobacterium. imipenem was the most potent inhibitor, as 81% and 95% of tested strains were inhibited at concentrations of 0.25 and 0.5 mg/l respectively.

TI  == in vitro activity of sch 34343 and cefbuperazone against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activities of sch 34343, a new penem antibiotic, and cefbuperazone,  a new cephamycin antibiotic, were determined against 459 clinical anaerobic bacterial isolates and compared with the activities of imipenem and cefoxitin, respectively, by an agar dilution method. both penems showed potent and similar activity against all anaerobic bacteria tested, particularly peptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis, and clostridium perfringens. all organisms except a single  strain of fusobacterium necrogenes were inhibited by an 8 micrograms/ml concentration of either sch 34343 or imipenem. overall, gram-positive bacilli, particularly lactobacillus species, clostridium difficile, and bifidobacterium and actinomyces species, were relatively more resistant to either penem than other genera of anaerobic bacteria tested. cefbuperazone demonstrated only modest activity against a wide spectrum of anaerobic bacteria. it had excellent and selective activity against b. fragilis and bacteroides vulgatus but was highly inactive against bacteroides distasonis and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron within the b. fragilis group. both cephamycins showed virtually no activity against c. difficile and lactobacillus spp. although cefbuperazone was more active against bifidobacterium spp., it had less activity against fusobacterium spp., eubacterium spp., and all bacteroides spp. other than b. fragilis and b. vulgatus.

TI  == anaerobic infections in childhood.
AB  == anaerobic bacteria are part of the normal flora of mucous membranes and outnumber aerobic bacteria in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract. anaerobes can be  isolated from pediatric patients with various infections when appropriate techniques for transportation and cultivation of samples are employed. frequently anaerobes are isolated in combination with other facultative or aerobic bacteria. the genera or groups of anaerobes most frequently isolated from pyogenic infections in children are (in order of decreasing frequency) offteroides, clostridium, gram-positive cocci, fusobacterium, gram-positive rods (eubacterium, lactobacillus, propionibacterium, actinomyces, and bifidobacterium), and gram-negative cocci (veillonella and acidaminococcus). clostridium perfringens causes bacteremia and wound infections. clostridium botulinum can produce a paralytic toxin that causes a lethal illness in adults and a paralytic syndrome in infants. clostridium difficile can cause antibiotic-associated colitis or diarrhea. bacteroides fragilis is most frequently involved in intraabdominal infections, infections of the female genital tract, subcutaneous abscesses, and bacteremia. bacteroides melaninogenicus and bacteroides oralis are the predominent anaerobes in orofacial infections and aspiration pneumonia. fusobacterium species are pathogens in aspiration pneumonia, brain abscesses, and orofacial infections. anaerobic gram-positive cocci can be recovered from all types of infections but predominate in respiratory tract and intra-abdominal infections. recognition of the pathogenic qualities of the various anaerobic organisms can assist in their prompt identification and in the initiation of appropriate therapy.

TI  == in vitro susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to nitroimidazoles.
AB  == the in vitro susceptibility of 355 swedish clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria to three nitroimidazole drugs was determined by the agar dilution method. the drugs were metronidazole, tinidazole and ornidazole. in addition the  in vitro susceptibility of 32 strains of clostridium difficile to metronidazole was determined. gram-negative rods and clostridia were inhibited by 4 microgram/ml or less of all three compounds except one strain of c. difficile, which was not inhibited by 16 microgram/ml of metronidazole. against strains of the bacteroides fragilis group, tinidazole was slightly more active than metronidazole and ornidazole. only about 70% of anaerobic cocci (peptococci and peptostreptococci) were inhibited by 4 microgram/ml of the three drugs, whereas the remaining isolates were resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration greater than or equal to 8 microgram/ml). anaerobic streptococci were not included in this material. actinomyces, arachnia and propionibacteria were resistant to the nitroimidazole drugs. at achievable serum levels, nitroimidazoles inhibited the majority of anaerobic bacteria found with greatest frequency in anaerobic infections.
