TI  == assessment of probiotics supplementation via feed or water on the growth performance, intestinal morphology and microflora of chickens after experimental  infection with eimeria acervulina, eimeria maxima and eimeria tenella.
AB  == in this study, the effect of probiotic supplementation via drinking water or feed on the performance of broiler chickens experimentally infected with sporulated oocysts of eimeria acervulina (5 x 10(4)), eimeria maxima and eimeria tenella (2  x 10(4) each one) at 14 days of age was evaluated. two hundred and forty 1-day-old ross 308 male chicks were separated into eight equal groups with three  replicates. two of the groups, one infected with mixed eimeria oocysts and the other not, were given a basal diet and served as controls. the remaining groups were also challenged with mixed eimeria species and received the basal diet and either water supplemented with probiotic (three groups) or probiotic via feed (two groups); the probiotic used consisted of enterococcus faecium #589, bifidobacterium animalis #503 and lactobacillus salivarius #505 at a ratio of 6:3:1. probiotic supplementation was applied either via drinking water in different inclusion rates (groups w1, w2 and w3) or via feed using uncoated (group fn) or coated strains (group fc). the last group was given the basal diet  supplemented with the anticoccidial lasalocid at 75 mg/kg. each experimental group was given the corresponding diet or drinking water from day 1 to day 42 of  age. throughout the experimental period of 42 days, body weight and feed intake were recorded weekly and feed conversion ratios were calculated. seven days after infection, the infected control group presented the lowest weight gain values, while probiotics supplied via feed supported growth to a comparable level with that of the lasalocid group. probiotic groups presented lesion score values and oocyst numbers that were lower than in control infected birds but higher than in  the lasalocid group. in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum, the highest villous height values were presented by probiotic groups. in conclusion, a mixture of probiotic substances gave considerable improvement in both growth performance and intestinal health in comparison with infected control birds and fairly similar improvement to an approved anticoccidial during a mixed eimeria infection.

TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == the effects of bee pollen extracts on the broiler chicken's gastrointestinal microflora.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bee pollen ethanolic extracts on the in vivo gastrointestinal tract microflora colonization of broiler chickens. a completely randomized experiment based on six treatments (different concentrations of bee pollen - 0, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 45 g kg(-1) diet) was used during 7 weeks. the highest count of faecal enterococci was found in the experimental group with the addition of 15 g of pollen (8.85 +/- 0.87 log cfu g(-1)) per 1 kg of feed mixture. the highest count of lactobacilli was detected in the experimental group with 35 g of pollen per 1 kg of feed mixture and the highest number of the enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in the control group (8.43 +/- 0.15 log cfu g(-1)). moreover, the maldi tof ms biotyper identified the following genera: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella  oxytoca, as well as lactobacillus acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. fermentum and l.  salivarius from the lactobacilli group and enterococcus avium, e. casseliflavus,  e. cecorum, e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. hirae and e. malodoratus from the enterococci group. additionally, the in vitro antimicrobial activities of pollen against five bacteria species isolated from gastrointestinal tracts of  chickens were tested. the best antimicrobial effect of the pollen extract was detected against k. oxytoca.

TI  == potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria of human origin induce antiproliferation of colon cancer cells via synergic actions in adhesion to cancer cells and short-chain fatty acid bioproduction.
AB  == the activities and modes of probiotic action of lactic acid bacteria isolated from infant feces were investigated for alternative application in the prevention and biotherapy of colon cancer. from a total of 81 isolates of gram-positive rod  and cocci bacteria obtained from healthy infants, only 15 isolates had the probiotic criteria which included growth inhibition against eight food-borne pathogens, no blood hemolysis, and tolerance to gastrointestinal tract properties such as ph 2.5 and 0.3 % bile salt. four probiotic bacteria showed antiproliferation of colon cancer cells with the use of mtt and trypan blue exclusion assay at the rates of 17-35 %. through comparison of probiotic 16s rrna sequences, they were identified as pediococcus pentosaceus fp3, lactobacillus salivarius fp25, l. salivarius fp35, and enterococcus faecium fp51. finding the mechanism of proliferative inhibition of colon cancer cells in this study indicated synergic induction by probiotic bacteria directly adhered to these cancer cells and triggered the bioproduction of short-chain fatty acids, mainly butyric and propionic acids. this study suggested that the use of these probiotics may be suitable as an alternative bioprophylactic and biotherapeutic strategy for colon cancer.

TI  == screening for lactic acid bacteria capable of inhibiting campylobacter jejuni in  in vitro simulations of the broiler chicken caecal environment.
AB  == thermotolerant campylobacter spp., specifically campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli, are the most common bacterial causes of human gastroenteritis in developed countries. consumption of improperly prepared poultry products and cross contamination are among the main causes of human campylobacteriosis. the aim of this study was to identify lactic acid bacterial (lab) strains capable of  inhibiting c. jejuni growth in initial in vitro trials ('spot-on-lawn' method), as well as in batch fermentation studies mimicking the broiler caecal environment. these experiments served as an indication for using these strains to decrease the capability of campylobacter to colonise and grow in the chicken caeca during primary production, with the aim of reducing the number of human campylobacteriosis cases. a total of 1,150 lab strains were screened for anti-campylobacter activity. six strains were selected: members of the species lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus agilis, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus salivarius, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. after treatment with catalase, proteinase k and a-chymotrypsin, anti-campylobacter activity of cell-free culture supernatant fluid (csf) for all six strains was retained, which indicated that activity was probably not exerted by bacteriocin production. based on the activity found in csf, the compounds produced by the selected strains are secreted and do not require presence of live bacterial producer cells for activity. during initial in vitro fermentation experiments, the e. faecalis strain exhibited the highest inhibitory activity for c. jejuni and was selected for further fermentation experiments. in these experiments we tested for therapeutic or protective effects of the e. faecalis strain against c. jejuni mb 4185 infection under simulated broiler caecal growth conditions. the best inhibition results were obtained when e. faecalis was inoculated before the  c. jejuni strain, lowering c. jejuni counts at least one log compared to a positive control. this effect was already observed 6 h after c. jejuni inoculation.

TI  == bacteriocin production, antibiotic susceptibility and prevalence of haemolytic and gelatinase activity in faecal lactic acid bacteria isolated from healthy ethiopian infants.
AB  == the objective of this study was to characterise lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from faecal samples of healthy ethiopian infants, with emphasis on bacteriocin production and antibiotic susceptibility. one hundred fifty lab were  obtained from 28 healthy ethiopian infants. the isolates belonged to lactobacillus (81/150), enterococcus (54/150) and streptococcus (15/150) genera.  lactobacillus species were more abundant in the breast-fed infants while enterococcus dominated the mixed-fed population. bacteriocin-producing lab species were isolated from eight of the infants. many different bacteriocins were identified, including one new bacteriocin from streptococcus salivarius, avicin a (class iia) from enterococcus avium, one class iia bacteriocin from enterococcus  faecalis strains, one unknown bacteriocin from e. faecalis and two unknown bacteriocins from lactobacillus fermentum strains and the two-peptide gassericin  t from lactobacillus gasseri isolate. susceptibility tests performed for nine antibiotics suggest that some lactobacilli might have acquired resistance to erythromycin (3 %) and tetracycline (4 %) only. the streptococci were generally antibiotic sensitive except for penicillin, to which they showed intermediate resistance. all enterococci were susceptible to ampicillin while 13 % showed penicillin resistance. only one e. faecalis isolate was vancomycin-resistant. tetracycline (51 %) and erythromycin (26 %) resistance was prevalent among the enterococci, but multidrug resistance was confined to e. faecalis (47 %) and enterococcus faecium (33 %). screening of enterococcal virulence traits revealed  that 2 % were beta-haemolytic. the structural genes of cytolysin were detected in 28 % of the isolates in five enterococcal species, the majority being e. faecalis and enterococcus raffinosus. this study shows that bacteriocin production and antibiotic resistance is a common trait of faecal lab of ethiopian infants while  virulence factors occur at low levels.

TI  == isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly irish subjects.
AB  == aims: to isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. methods and results: screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects,  using the indicator organisms lactobacillus bulgaricus lmg 6901 and listeria innocua dpc 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. genomic fingerprinting following apai digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. the antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. the predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus and enterococcus spp. a number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including abp-118 and salivaricin b (from lact. salivarius), enterocin b (enterococcus faecium), lactacin b (lact. acidophilus),  gassericin t and a variant of gassericin a (lact. gasseri), were identified. interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: lactococcus lactis producing nisin z and streptococcus mutans producing mutacin ii. conclusion: these data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). significance and impact of the study: the results presented are important due to  growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.

TI  == evaluating the efficacy of an avian-specific probiotic to reduce the colonization of campylobacter jejuni in broiler chickens.
AB  == campylobacteriosis is the most frequent zoonotic disease in humans worldwide, and the contaminated poultry meat by campylobacter jejuni can be considered one of the important sources of enteric infections in humans. the use of probiotics, which can help to improve the natural defense of animals against pathogenic bacteria, is an alternative and effective approach to antibiotic administration for livestock to reduce bacterial contamination. in vitro experiments showed that enterococcus faecium, pediococcus acidilactici, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus reuteri isolated from healthy chicken gut inhibited the growth of c. jejuni. to demonstrate this effect in vivo, 1-d-old broiler chicks received 2  mg/bird per day of a multispecies probiotic product via the drinking water. controls received no probiotic treatment, and all chicks were infected with c. jejuni orally. results showed that the cecal colonization by c. jejuni was significantly reduced by probiotic treatment at both 8 and 15 d postchallenge. to confirm this effect, in a second in vivo experiment, 1-d-old broiler chicks received the same dose of the same probiotic via the drinking water and controls  received no probiotic, and all chicks were infected with c. jejuni orally. similarly, probiotic treatment reduced (p=0.001) cecal colonization by c. jejuni  at both 8 and 15 d postchallenge. the results of our in vivo experiments conclude that probiotic administration reduced the colonization of c. jejuni in broiler chickens.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of propolis on the microbiota from gastrointestinal tract of chickens.
AB  == the aim of this study was to examine the effect of propolis extracts on the microbial colonization of chicken gastrointestinal tract in vivo. the propolis was administered to both feed mixtures in various amounts except of the control group. the addition of 150 mg propolis to 1 kg of feed was included in the first  experimental group, the addition of 450 mg.kg(-1) in the second experimental group, the addition of 600 mg.kg(-1) the third experimental group and 800 mg kg(-1) in the fourth one. the highest count of faecal enterococci was found in the third group (8.6 cfu.g(-1)) where 600 mg of propolis to 1 kg was added to the feed mixture. the highest count of lactobacilli was detected in the fourth experimental group (8.83 cfu.g(-1)) where was 800 mg of propolis added to 1 kg of feed mixture and number of enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in control group (8.73 cfu.g(-1)). with rtq pcr detected species from the genus enterococcus were: e. avium, e. casseliflavus, e cecorum, e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. hirae and e. malodoratus and from genus lactobacillus were: lactobacillus crispatus, l. acidophilus and l. salivarius. with maldi tof ms biotyper from enterobacteriaceae genera were identified citrobacter braakii, raoultella ornithinolytica, serratia fonticola, escherichia coli and klebsiella oxytoca. antimicrobial activities in vitro of six species of bacteria isolated from gastrointestinal tract of chickens were also tested. the best antimicrobial  effect of citrobacter braakii on ethanolic propolis extract in all concentrations were found.

TI  == dietary inclusion of feathers affects intestinal microbiota and microbial metabolites in growing leghorn-type chickens.
AB  == feather pecking in laying hens is a serious behavioral problem that is often associated with feather eating. the intake of feathers may influence the gut microbiota and its metabolism. the aim of this study was to determine the effect  of 2 different diets, with or without 5% ground feathers, on the gut microbiota and the resulting microbial fermentation products and to identify keratin-degrading bacteria in chicken digesta. one-day-old lohmann-selected leghorn chicks were divided into 3 feeding groups: group a (control), b (5% ground feathers in the diet), and c, in which the control diet was fed until wk 12 and then switched to the 5% feather diet to study the effect of time of first  feather ingestion. the gut microbiota was analyzed by cultivation and denaturing  gradient gel electrophoresis of ileum and cecum digesta. short-chain fatty acids, ammonia, and lactate concentrations were measured as microbial metabolites. the concentration of keratinolytic bacteria increased after feather ingestion in the  ileum (p < 0.001) and cecum (p = 0.033). bacterial species that hydrolyzed keratin were identified as enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus reuteri-like species (97% sequence homology), and lactobacillus salivarius-like species (97% sequence homology). molecular analysis of cecal dna  extracts showed that the feather diet lowered the bacterial diversity indicated by a reduced richness (p < 0.001) and shannon (p = 0.012) index. the pattern of microbial metabolites indicated some changes, especially in the cecum. this study showed that feather intake induced an adaptation of the intestinal microbiota in  chickens. it remains unclear to what extent the changed metabolism of the microbiota reflects the feather intake and could have an effect on the behavior of the hens.

TI  == presence of erythromycin and tetracycline resistance genes in lactic acid bacteria from fermented foods of indian origin.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) resistant to erythromycin were isolated from different food samples on selective media. the isolates were identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus lactis, enterococcus casseliflavus, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides. of the total 60 isolates, 88 % harbored the ermb gene. the efflux gene msra was identified in e. faecium, e. durans, e. lactis, e. casseliflavus, p. pentosaceus  and l. fermentum. further analysis of the msra gene by sequencing suggested its homology to msrc. resistance to tetracycline due to the genes tetm, tetw, teto, tetk and tetl, alone or in combination, were identified in lactobacillus species. the tetracycline efflux genes tetk and tetl occurred in p. pentosaceus and enterococcus species. since it appeared that lab had acquired these genes, fermented foods may be a source of antibiotic resistance.

TI  == determination of wine microbiota using classical method, polymerase chain method  and step one real-time pcr during fermentation process.
AB  == the aim of our study was the identification of grape, must and wine microbiota during the fermentation process using a classical microbiological method and real-time pcr. the changes in different groups of microorganisms were monitored in total counts of bacteria, lactobacilli and yeasts. microbiological parameters  were observed during the current collection and processing of grapes in 2009. samples were taken during the fermentation process in wine enterprises and a private vineyard. during this period 30 samples of wine among muller thurgau, cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay, tramin and red bio-wine were examined. samples were collected from stages of grape-must unfiltered, grape-must filtered, the beginning of fermentation, fermentation, late fermentation and young wine. the highest total counts of bacteria ranged from 0.00 to 176 +/- 15 cfu.ml(-1) in the wine of muller thurgau, the highest number of yeast ranged from 0.00 to 150 +/- 9 cfu.ml(-1) in the wine of muller thurgau and the number of lactobacillus spp. ranged from 0.00 to 92 +/- 5 cfu.ml(-1) in the sample of cabernet sauvignon wine. the presence and sensitivity of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus salivarius were detected using real-time pcr (rtq pcr). susceptibility of enterococcus faecium varied in different isolates from 1 to 10(6) cfu.ml(-1), the sensitivity of the species lactobacillus acidophilus in different isolates of the wine samples ranged from 1 to 10(5) cfu.ml(-1). we also monitored representation of species lactobacillus crispatus, which were captured  by rtq pcr sensitivity and ranged from 1 to 10(5) cfu.ml(-1). identification of the species lactobacillus salivarius in each of isolates by rtq pcr method showed the presence of these bacteria in the range of 1 to 10(4) cfu.ml(-1).

TI  == effect of mannoproteins on the growth, gastrointestinal viability, and adherence  to caco-2 cells of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == yeast cell wall (ycw) preparations and yeast mannoprotein extracts have been effective against some enteropathogenic bacteria as campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, and salmonella, and they can affect the population of beneficial lactic acid bacteria (lab). in this work, we studied the effect of a mannoprotein extract on five strains of lab. this extract was metabolised by the  bacteria, enhancing their survival in simulated gastrointestinal juice, and increasing the adherence of lactobacillus plantarum, l. salivarius, and enterococcus faecium to caco-2 cells. yeast mannoproteins are promising naturally occurring compounds that could be used to enhance lab intestinal populations and  control pathogens.

TI  == inducer bacteria, unique signal peptides, and low-nutrient media stimulate in vitro bacteriocin production by lactobacillus spp. and enterococcus spp. strains.
AB  == bacteriocins (bcn) are antimicrobial peptides that provide potential to control bacterial infections in a variety of applications. we previously reported on three class iia bcn molecules produced by lactobacillus salivarius b-30514 (or-7), enterococcus faecium b-30746 (e 50-52), and enterococcus durans/faecium/hirae b-30745 (e-760). these bcn are notably effective against a wide array of pathogenic bacteria. to commercially apply such bcn, adequate quantities must be produced and harvested. we determined that a combination of host producer synthesized signal peptides (sp) in the presence of both producer and inducer bacteria grown in a dilute fermentation medium enabled marked increases in the synthesis of bcn. these sp contained 24-30 amino acid residues with sizes ranging from 2095 to 3065 da having the unique terminal carboxyl sequence of vkglt. the inducer bacterial isolates used were lactobacillus acidophilus b-30510 and lactobacillus crispatus b-30884. we used a nutrient-limited medium of 10% brucella broth (containing 0.01% glucose) to enhance bcn production. using the combination of these above three parameters enabled us to reproducibly harvest at least 200 mg of bcn/l of the spent fermentation broth. this information can be used to assist in the production of bcn.

TI  == examination of equine glandular stomach lesions for bacteria, including helicobacter spp by fluorescence in situ hybridisation.
AB  == background: the equine glandular stomach is commonly affected by erosion and ulceration. the aim of this study was to assess whether bacteria, including helicobacter, could be involved in the aetiology of gastric glandular lesions seen in horses. results: stomach lesions, as well as normal appearing mucosa were obtained from horses slaughtered for human consumption. all samples were tested for urease activity using the pyloritek assay, while mucosal bacterial content was evaluated using fluorescence in situ hybridisation. in selected sub samples,  bacteria characterisation was pursued further by cloning and sequencing. mucosal  lesions were found in 36/63 stomachs and included hyperplastic rugae, polypoid structures and focal erosions. none of the samples were tested positive for urease activity or for fish using the helicobacter genus specific probe. in samples of lesions, as well as normal samples, clones with 99% similarities to lactobacillus salivarius and sarcina ventriculi were found. escherichia like bacterium clones and enterococcus clones were demonstrated in one focal erosion.  based on a phylogenetic tree these clones had 100% similarity to escherichia fergusonii and enterococcus faecium. the enterococcus were found colonising the mucosal surface, while e. fergusonii organisms were also demonstrated intraepithelial. conclusion: gastric helicobacter spp. could not be verified as being involved in lesions of the glandular stomach of the horse. since e. fergusonii has been described as an emerging pathogen in both humans and animals, the finding of this bacterium in gastric erosion warrants further clarification to whether gastric infection with this type bacterium is important for horses.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic activities of animal intestinal strains against swine-associated pathogens.
AB  == a wide range of enteropathogens cause costly diarrhoeal diseases in fattening piglets and account for food-related infections in humans. the objective of this  study was to screen beneficial bacterial strains from the gastrointestinal tract  of various animal sources for antagonistic activity against diverse pathogens associated with hazardous pig production times. using agar spot assays, 15 well-characterized strains belonging to lactobacillus, enterococcus, bifidobacterium and bacillus were studied for inhibition of clostridium perfringens type a, various serovars of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, as well as brachyspira pilosicoli. strong antagonists were further analyzed by studying their cell-free supernatants with and without ph neutralization, proteinase k and catalase treatment. enterobacteriaceae were effectively inhibited by lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus reuteri strains, independent from the animal source, and on a lower level by single strains belonging to lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus amylovorus and bifidobacterium thermophilum, due to organic acid production. the bacillus subtilis strain was found to produce an anti-clostridial and anti-brachyspira metabolite of proteinaceous nature. homofermentative lactobacilli and b. thermophilum could suppress the growth of b. pilosicoli, the causative agent of intestinal spirochaetosis, whereas heterofermentative strains belonging to l. reuteri and l. mucosae had no effect. the lactic acid bacteria exerted their activity primarily by organic acid release, except one enterococcus faecium and l. amylovorus strain, which exhibited antagonism through joint activity of lactate and hydrogen peroxide. the findings of this study provide a basis for further in vitro studies and encourage feeding studies to evaluate the antagonistic potential of promising strains in pig production.

TI  == identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of porcine bacteria that inhibit  the growth of brachyspira hyodysenteriae in vitro.
AB  == aims: to identify bacilli, lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria that inhibit the growth of brachyspira hyodysenteriae. methods and results: a total of 80 isolates were obtained from various porcine intestinal compartments using selective conditions and grouped into 15 similarity clusters based on whole-cell  protein profiles. random amplified polymorphic dna pcr patterns identified 24 genotypes. 16s rdna sequencing assigned all genotypes, except eight aerobes, to established species (bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus amylovorus, bifidobacterium thermophilum). according to their minimum inhibitory  concentrations, four strains (ent. faecium, lact. reuteri, lact. amylovorus, bif. thermophilum) were susceptible to all clinically relevant antibiotics. two lactobacilli showing multiresistance harboured the erm(b) determinant. a cross-section of eight representative strains was examined for growth suppression of two strains of brach. hyodysenteriae, the aetiological agent of swine dysentery, and compared with intestinal strains derived from other animal sources. the brachyspira strains were inhibited by strains of lact. salivarius, bif. thermophilum, ent. faecium and b. subtilis. conclusions: three porcine strains of ent. faecium, bif. thermophilum and b. subtilis were found to be suitable as probiotic candidates because of their well-established identity, antibiotic susceptibility and antagonistic activity. significance and impact of the study: for the first time, antagonistic activity of well-characterized porcine strains against brach. hyodysenteriae is presented. these findings suggest that certain intestinal strains might have a potential as probiotic feed  additives for prevention of swine dysentery.

TI  == main microorganisms involved in the fermentation of ugandan ghee.
AB  == ghee is widely produced from a traditional fermented butter-like product named mashita in western uganda. however, no detailed studies have been done to identify the microorganisms involved in mashita fermentation. the aim of this study was to identify the microorganisms present at the end of mashita ripening using culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. the most commonly identified species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in mashita using culture-dependent techniques were lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus perolens constituting 37.3%, 10.1%, 8.1% and 7.7% of total bacterial colonies isolated respectively. l. paracasei was the only bacterial species identified in all mashita samples by culture-dependent technique. two of the four most commonly isolated lab species (l. helveticus and l. plantarum) were also identified in mashita by a culture-independent method (pcr-dgge). other main lab species identified in mashita by pcr-dgge were bifidobacterium sp., enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus acetotolerans, lactobacillus sp., lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and streptococcus salivarius. the main species of acetic acid bacteria (aab) identified in the mashita using pcr-dgge method were acetobacter aceti, acetobacter lovaniensis, acetobacter orientalis and acetobacter pasteurianus. pcr-dgge identification of yeasts showed that brettanomyces custersianus, candida silvae, geotrichum sp., issatchenkia occidentalis, issatchenkia orientalis, kluyveromyces marxianus, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and trichosporon asahii were main yeast species in mashita. a. lovaniensis, a. aceti, and i. orientalis were identified in all the six mashita samples analyzed using pcr-dgge method. other microbial species were only found in some samples. these results indicate that lab and yeasts, as in similar fermentation products, but also aab are main microbial groups involved in mashita fermentation.

AB  == the genus streptococcus consists of more than 60 species, but only streptococcus  equi subspecies zooepidemicus, streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus, streptococcus gallinaceus, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus suis have been isolated from poultry. during investigations of the  aetiology of increased mortality in broiler parent stock at the end of production, pure cultures of streptococcal-like organisms that could not be classified among these six species were obtained from 24 cases of septicaemia or  valvular endocarditis and septicaemia. phenotypic characterization using the api20 strep kit identified the isolates as aerococcus viridans (10), aerococcus urinae (2), leuconostoc species (4), streptococcus salivarius (2), streptococcus  bovis ii 3 (1), enterococcus avium (3), enterococcus faecium (1) or gemella morbillorum (1). however, this identification was misleading as subsequent genetic investigations using pulse field gel electrophoresis and sequencing of 16s rrna genes showed that 19 isolates were classified as streptococcus pluranimalium, while the remaining isolates were e. avium (3), e. faecium (1) or  lactobacillus species (1). misidentification by api20 strep was related to the database provided by the manufacturer, as the phenotypic characteristics could identify these organisms as s. pluranimalium. the isolates of s. pluranimalium belonged to at least three different clones as determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis of smai-digested genomic dna. the capacity that these isolates had to colonize the valvular endothelium was suggested by the occurrence of valvular endocarditis in 12 of 19 cases. demonstration of the same clone in all four houses on a farm suggested the pathogenic potential of this organism.

TI  == evaluation in vitro of the antagonistic substances produced by lactobacillus spp. isolated from chickens.
AB  == to determine the inhibitory capacity of lactic acid bacteria due to the action of antagonistic substances, we tested 474 isolates of lactobacillus from the crop and cecum of chickens against gram-positive and gram-negative indicator microorganisms by the spot-on-the-lawn and well-diffusion antagonism methods. of  the 474 isolates, 265 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the indicator microorganisms. isolates identified as l. reuteri, l. salivarius, or lactobacillus spp. inhibited enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella spp. but not l. casei, l. delbrueckii, l. fermentum, or l. helveticus by the well-diffusion simultaneous antagonism method  under anaerobic incubation conditions. the antagonistic substances produced by some of the lactobacillus isolates were inactivated after treatment by proteolytic enzymes, which suggested that the substances could be antimicrobial peptides or bacteriocins.

TI  == [adhesion of various species of lactic acid bacteria depending on the ab0 system  blood group].
AB  == the influence of the ab0 blood groups on adhesion of different lactic acid bacteria species was studied. from twelve investigated strains of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus,  l. plantarum and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus species, difference between adhesion average index on erythrocytes of various blood groups was found in two strains. the average adhesion index of the strain e. faecium k-50 in a (ii) blood group erythrocytes was higher (aai = 4.91 +/- 0.26) than in b (iii) blood group erythrocytes (aai = 4.17 +/- 0.33). the strain l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 4n has displayed a higher adhesive activity in a (ii) blood group erythrocytes (aai = 4.36 +/- 0.13) in comparison with ab (iii) blood group erythrocytes (aai = 3.61 +/- 0.75).

TI  == [reversion of antibiotic-sensitivity of lactic acid bacteria in grafted cultures  of lymphoblastoid human cells].
AB  == the reversion of the antibiotic sensitivity of lactic acid bacteria: streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus plantarum have been studied. the phenomenon of the reversion has been fists studied in lactic acid bacteria of different taxonomic groups at their interactions with lymphoblastoid human cells. it is shown that resistance of lactobacteria to antibiotics can change depending on the terms of cultivation, genus and strain specificity. most often the reversion of antibiotic sensitivity  was observed with respect to fuzidin (26%) and cefepim (23%), most rarely--with respect to cephazolin, erithromicin, cefamandol, tobramicin and oxacillin.

TI  == [study of vaginal and intestinal microflora of women in the prenatal period and its correction in dysbacteriosis].
AB  == a comparative research of the structure of vaginal and intestinal microflora in norm and at kidney pathologies in women in the prenatal period was carried out. at physiologically normal course of pregnancy microbiocenosis of vagina and intestine does not contain pathogenic and conditional-pathogenic microorganisms.  lactic acid bacteria are fixed within the limits of 10(5)-10(8) cfu/1 ml in the vagina secretion and 10(7)-10(8) cfu/1 g in the intestine content. the spore microorganisms have completely disappeared in vaginal biocenosis of women with pyelonephritis after pharmacotherapy; and colibacterias has disappeared in 62% of women. quantity of lactic acid bacteria has also decreased. quantity of e. coli (10(8)- 10(9)) cfu/g, sporous microorganisms (10(3)-10(4)) cfu/g and yeast (10(4)-10(5)) cfu/g has considerably increased in the content of intestine. lactic acid bacteria in content of the vagina are presented by: lactobacillus acidophilus, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. vaginalis; in content of the intestine--l. plantarum and l. fermentum. all the isolated strains of lactobacilli are resistant to metrogyl and amphotericin, 87%--to cephoxitine, cypropfloxacine. twenty three of 24 strains of lactic acid bacteria--antagonists  of pathogenic microflora have shown adhesion to vaginal epthelium. the degree of  adhesive activity depends on the strain and genus specificity of cultures. the highest index of adhesiveness in indicated in enterococcus faecium (5.82 - 7.62)  and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (2.74 - 6.40) strains. the screening of strains has been performed, which suppress growth of gas-producing microflora. the strain of lactobacillus plantarum 200d proved to be the most active one. a complex of cultures of the lactic bacteria providing normalization  of microbial cenosis of the vagina in women in the prenatal period has been selected as based on the data obtained. the biotechnology of production of vaginal suppositories is developed.

TI  == development of a competitive exclusion product for poultry meeting the regulatory requirements for registration in the european union.
AB  == competitive exclusion treatment is able to increase the pathogen colonization resistance of day-old chicks by applying probiotic bacteria stabilizing the indigenous microflora. in order to develop a safe microbial feed additive, various bacterial strains were isolated out of the gastrointestinal tract of healthy chickens. one hundred twenty-one representatives were selected based on differences in whole-cell protein patterns and screened for antagonistic properties. five effective strains (pediococcus acidilactici, enterococcus faecium, bifidobacterium animalis ssp. animalis, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus salivarius ssp. salivarius) exhibited in vitro the ability to inhibit a range of common pathogens and were evaluated with regard to the risks associated with genetic transfer of antibiotic resistances from animals to humans via the food chain. the probiotic strains were sensitive to several clinically effective antibiotics, though some of them showed single resistances. none of the vancomycin-resistant (r) strains carried the enterococcal vana gene. two tetracycline r strains were shown to harbor a tet(m)-associated resistance. the strains contained no extrachromosomal dna and were not able to transfer the resistance by means of conjugation. on basis of the collected data the presence of easy transferable resistances was excluded and the chicken strains were considered to be suitable for the use as feed additive.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from aoc salers cheese.
AB  == the objective of this work was to describe the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  in traditional raw milk salers cheeses at the species and strain levels. the characterization of 381 strains isolated during ripening and various strain collections was investigated using physiological analysis and molecular techniques: rep-pcr, species and genus specific amplifications and the sequence analysis of 16s rdna for strain typing and taxonomic identification. the strains  belonged to lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garviae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus millieri, streptococcus macedonicus and pediococcus pentosaceus. a  wide phenotypic and genomic heterogeneity was observed within the different species (lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and leuconostoc mesenteroides) according to the origin and the time of ripening. the natural microflora was different from strain collection and each method must be combined  to identify and characterize natural microflora. this study revealed the low selectivity of selective media used for the isolation of different groups of lactic acid bacteria except the facultatively heterofermentative lactobacilli medium selecting mesophile lactobacilli and sb medium selective for enterococcus. the study reveals, for the first time, the microbial lactic acid bacteria community of salers cheese and its diversity. a better knowledge of microbial flora will be useful to improve understanding of sensory quality of cheeses.

TI  == characterisation of is153, an is3-family insertion sequence isolated from lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and its use for strain differentiation.
AB  == an insertion sequence has been identified in the genome of lactobacillus sanfranciscensis dsm 20451t as segment of 1351 nucleotides containing 37-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. the sequence of this element encodes two out of phase, overlapping open reading frames, orfa and orfb, from which three putative proteins are produced. orfab is a transframe protein produced by -1 translational frame shifting between orf a and orf b that is presumed to be the transposase. the large orfab of this element encodes a 342 amino acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the is3 family. in l. sanfranciscensis type strain dsm 20451t multiple truncated is elements were identified. inverse pcr was used to analyze target sites of four of these elements, but except of their highly at rich character not any sequence specificity was identified so far. moreover, no flanking direct repeats were identified. multiple copies of is153 were detected by hybridization in other strains of l. sanfranciscensis. resulting hybridization patterns were shown to differentiate between organisms at strain level rather than a probe targeted against the 16s rdna. with a pcr based approach is153 or highly similar sequences were detected in l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. malefermentans, l. plantarum, l. hilgardii, l. collinoides l. farciminis l. sakei and l. salivarius, l. reuteri as well as in enterococcus faecium, pediococcus acidilactici and p. pentosaceus.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
AB  == bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of  ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.

TI  == antilisterial activity by enterococci in a model predicting the temperature evolution of taleggio, an italian soft cheese.
AB  == enterococcus ssp. produced broad-spectrum bacteriocins, which were active against listeria innocua and listeria monocytogenes. inhibition of l. innocua in milk by  different starter cultures was evaluated. milk was inoculated with a conventional starter (streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus mixed cultures) as a sole starter or in combination with inhibitory starter cultures (enterococcus ssp., bacteriocin-producing strains). tests were performed under a temperature gradient that reproduced the first 55 h  of taleggio cheese manufacturing and in the presence of rennet. results indicated that satisfactory inhibition of l. innocua was linked to the combined synergistic antimicrobial effect of ph decrease and bacteriocin production. overall, data suggested that a potential existed for use of the antagonistic activity from enterococci for protection of taleggio cheese during ripening, when l. monocytogenes may often reach dangerous concentrations.

TI  == acid production from lycasin, maltitol, sorbitol and xylitol by oral streptococci and lactobacilli.
AB  == the acid production from maltitol was compared with the acid production from hydrogenated starch hydrolysate (lycasin), sorbitol and xylitol by a number of oral strains and reference strains of streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. mitior, s. milleri, s. faecalis, s. faecium, s. avium, lactobacillus casei and l. salivarius. the polyols were added to a final concentration of 1.0% to two different basal media. incubation was performed at 37 degrees c for 7 days after which the ph was recorded. maltitol was fermented only by the lactobacilli (about two thirds of the strains). lycasin was fermented by all strains of s. faecalis, more than 90% of the lactobacilli, about half of the s. sanguis strains, about one third of the s. mutans strains, and by a few other streptococcal strains. acid production from sorbitol was observed among more than 80% of the s. mutans strains and the s. faecalis strains and most of the lactobacilli strains. sorbitol-fermenting strains of s. sanguis and of s. mitior, all isolated from sorbitol-consumers, were observed. no other sorbitol-fermenting streptococci were found. only the reference strains l. salivarius subsp. salivarius atcc 11741 and s. avium atcc 14025 fermented xylitol.
