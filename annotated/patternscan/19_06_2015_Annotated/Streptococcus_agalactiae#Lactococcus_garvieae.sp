TI  == isolation and molecular identification of the etiological agents of streptococcosis in nile tilapia (oreochromis niloticus) cultured in net cages in  lake sentani, papua, indonesia.
AB  == infections with streptococcus spp. were observed in nile tilapia cultured in net  cages in lake sentani, papua, indonesia. clinical signs included exophthalmia, erratic swimming, ascites in abdominal cavity, and external hemorrhages. four types of bacterial colonies (sk, k10, p20, and m12) were isolated from the brain, kidney, and eyes. based on phenotypic and genetic (16s rdna sequencing) characteristics, the isolates were identified as streptococcus iniae (sk), streptococcus agalactiae (k10 and p20) and lactococcus garvieae (m12). the latter species has not been previously isolated or reported from fish streptococcosis in indonesia. intraperitoneal injection of healthy tilapia with the bacterial species caused significant morbidity (70%) within 3 days and 100% mortality at 6  days post injection. experimental infections and reisolation of the bacteria from morbid and dead fish suggest they are the causative agents of streptococcosis, which rendered high mortality among cage cultured nile tilapia in lake sentani. our results suggest the need for developing diagnostic tools for accurate identification of the agents of streptococcosis. as tilapia aquaculture continues to expand as a means of food production and livelihood in indonesia, it becomes crucial to ensure that fish resources are monitored and protected from the adverse effects of infectious diseases.

TI  == development of real-time pcr for detection and quantitation of streptococcus parauberis.
AB  == streptococcus parauberis is an increasing threat to aquaculture of olive flounder, paralichthys olivaceus temminck & schlegel, in south korea. we developed a real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method using the taqman probe assay to detect and quantify s. parauberis by targeting the gyrb gene sequences, which are effective for molecular analysis of the genus streptococcus. our real-time pcr assay is capable of detecting 10 fg of genomic dna per reaction. the intra- and interassay coefficient of variation (cv) values ranged from 0.42-1.95%, demonstrating that the assay has good reproducibility. there was not any cross-reactivity to streptococcus iniae or to other streptococcal/lactococcal fish pathogens, such as s. agalactiae and lactococcus garvieae, indicating that the assay is highly specific to s. parauberis. the results of the real-time pcr assay corresponded well to those of conventional culture assays for s. parauberis from inoculated tissue homogenates (r = 0.957; p < 0.05). hence, this sensitive and specific real-time pcr is a valuable tool for  diagnostic quantitation of s. parauberis in clinical samples.

TI  == development of a reverse line blot hybridization method for detection of some streptococcal/lactococcal species, the causative agents of zoonotic streptococosis/lactococosis in farmed fish.
AB  == background and objective: streptococcosis/lactococcosis is the cause of high morbidity and mortality in aquaculture sector and to date a number of species of  streptococcus and lactococcus genera including s. iniae, s. agalactiae, s. dysagalactiae, s. parauberis, s. feacalis, l. garvieae and l. lactis have been discriminated as the cause of disease in aquatic animals. despite the use of diagnostic molecular methods for each of these bacterial species, no data is available on a suitable, rapid and simple simultaneous detection tool for these pathogens. this paper describes a simultaneous detection method which is pcr based on a reverse line blot (rlb) for rapid detection and differentiation of four species of genera of streptococcus and lactococcus genera consisting of s. iniae, s. agalactiae, s. parauberis and l. garvieae the most important agents of  the disease in fish. materials and methods: a reverse line blot (rlb) assay was developed for the simultaneously identification of four species of streptococcus/lactococcusconsisting of s. iniae, s. parauberis, s. agalactiaeand  lactococcusgarvieae. the assay employs one set of primer pair for specific amplification of the 16s rrna gene. these were designed based on the nucleotide sequences of 16s rrna gene sharing a homology region with streptococcus spp. and  lactococcus spp. dna was extracted from the pure bacterial colonies and amplified. a membrane was prepared with specific oligonucleotide for each bacterial species. pcr products were then hybridized to a membrane. results and conclusion: the amplification resulted in pcr product of 241 bp in length. no cross-reactions were observed between any of the tested bacterial species, and mixed dnas from these four bacterial species were correctly identified. this rlb  method is a suitable technique for a simultaneous detection of these species of bacterial fish pathogens that are some of the main causes of streptococcal/lactococcal infections in both freshwater and marine aquatic animals, and so we recommend its use for integrated epidemiological monitoring of streptococcosis/lactococcis in aquaculture industry.

TI  == streptococcus spp. and related bacteria: their identification and their pathogenic potential for chronic mastitis - a molecular approach.
AB  == streptococcus spp. and related bacteria form a large group of organisms which are associated with bovine intramammary infections (imi). some of them are the well-known mastitis pathogens streptococcus uberis and streptococcus agalactiae.  in addition, there are a considerable number of these gram-positive, catalase-negative cocci (pnc) with unclear mastitic pathogenicity such as aerococcus viridans which make the conventional diagnostics of pnc difficult. one diagnostic, api 20 strep (api, biomerieux) is recommended which, as a phenotypic  assay, involves a series of miniaturized biochemical tests. recently, preference  is given to genotypic identification methods. in particular, sequencing of the 16s rrna gene allows highly reproducible and accurate identification of bacteria  and permits discovery of novel, clinically relevant bacteria. as a consequence, the aim of the present study was to compare identification of imi-associated pnc  by the api method as well as by sequencing of their 16s rrna gene (16s). furthermore, the correlation of these bacteria to bovine chronic mastitis and their phylogeny was investigated. 102 pnc isolated from single quarter milk samples were identified by api and 16s sequencing. considering streptococcus uberis, streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and streptococcus agalactiae, both methods generated fully concordant results. in contrast, a very  high disconcordance was observed for most of the other pnc, in particular enterococcus spp., aerococcus viridans and the viridans streptococci were shown as apathogenic. lactococcus garvieae was found to be an opportunistic pathogen causing imi during late lactation. in addition, pnc isolated from milk were frequently observed together with other bacteria, in particular with staphylococcus spp. in these cases, the levels of somatic cell counts (scc) were  determined by the specific pnc present in the sample. considering pnc phylogeny based on 16s sequencing, 3 major clusters were observed. they included all the common mastitis pathogens (cluster i), the lactococcus spp., enterococcus spp. and aerococcus spp. (cluster ii) and all the viridans streptococci (cluster iii).

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with fish and the fish farm environment, established by amplified rrna gene restriction analysis.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria have become a major source of concern for aquaculture in recent decades. in addition to true pathogenic species of worldwide significance, such as streptococcus iniae and lactococcus garvieae, several species have been reported to produce occasional fish mortalities in limited geographic areas, and  many unidentifiable or ill-defined isolates are regularly isolated from fish or fish products. to clarify the nature and prevalence of different fish-associated  bacteria belonging to the lactic acid bacterium group, a collection of 57 isolates of different origins was studied and compared with a set of 22 type strains, using amplified rrna gene restriction analysis (ardra). twelve distinct  clusters were delineated on the basis of ardra profiles and were confirmed by sequencing of soda and 16s rrna genes. these clusters included the following: lactococcus raffinolactis, l. garvieae, lactococcus l., s. iniae, s. dysgalactiae, s. parauberis, s. agalactiae, carnobacterium spp., the enterococcus "faecium" group, a heterogeneous enterococcus-like cluster comprising indiscernible representatives of vagococcus fluvialis or the recently recognized  v. carniphilus, v. salmoninarum, and aerococcus spp. interestingly, the l. lactis and l. raffinolactis clusters appeared to include many commensals of fish, so opportunistic infections caused by these species cannot be disregarded. the significance for fish populations and fish food processing of three or four genetic clusters of uncertain or complex definition, namely, aerococcus and enterococcus clusters, should be established more accurately.

TI  == first report of streptococcus agalactiae and lactococcus garvieae from a wild bottlenose dolphin (tursiops truncatus).
AB  == the isolation and characterization of two bacterial species, streptococcus agalactiae and lactococcus garvieae, previously unreported in wild marine mammals are described from a freshly dead bottlenose dolphin, tursiops truncatus, from kuwait bay, kuwait, in september 2001. conventional and rapid identification systems were used to determine that isolates from muscle and kidney were s. agalactiae and l. garvieae, respectively. the isolates were gram-positive, catalase-negative, oxidase-negative, nonhemolytic cocci. the s. agalactiae was serotyped to group antigen b, whereas the l. garvieae could not be assigned to any serogroup. these kuwait isolates displayed considerable homogeneity with corresponding american type culture collection (atcc) type isolates. although the dolphin s. agalactiae isolate was nonhemolytic, it was biochemically similar to s. agalactiae isolated from mullet sampled in the concurrent kuwait bay fish kill. some biochemical heterogeneity was observed between the dolphin isolates and corresponding mammalian atcc type isolates, especially with voges proskauer,  alanine-phenylanaline-proline arylamidase, and alpha-galactosidase tests. nile tilapia, oreochromis niloticus, experimentally infected with the dolphin s. agalactiae and l. garvieae isolates experienced 90% and 0% mortalities, respectively. this is the first isolation of s. agalactiae and l. garvieae from a wild marine mammal, and the microbial characteristics established here provide pertinent information for the future isolation of these bacteria.
