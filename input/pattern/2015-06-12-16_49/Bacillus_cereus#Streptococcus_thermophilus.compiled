TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from cheeses and yogurts.
AB  - The biopreservation of foods using bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated directly from foods is an innovative approach. The objectives of this study were to isolate and identify bacteriocinogenic LAB from various cheeses and yogurts and evaluate their antimicrobial effects on selected spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in vitro as well as on a food commodity.LAB were isolated using MRS and M17 media. The agar diffusion bioassay was used to screen for bacteriocin or bacteriocin-like substances (BLS) producing LAB using Lactobacillus sakei and Listeria innocua as indicator organisms. Out of 138 LAB isolates, 28 were found to inhibit these bacteria and were identified as strains of Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Eight isolates were tested for antimicrobial activity at 5 degrees C and 20 degrees C against L. innocua, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Erwinia carotovora, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides using the agar diffusion bioassay, and also against Penicillium expansum, Botrytis cinerea and Monilinia frucitcola using the microdilution plate method. The effect of selected LAB strains on L. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions was also investigated.Twenty percent of our isolates produced BLS inhibiting the growth of L. innocua and/or Lact. sakei. Organic acids and/or H2O2 produced by LAB and not the BLS had strong antimicrobial effects on all microorganisms tested with the exception of E. coli. Ent. faecium, Strep. thermophilus and Lact. casei effectively inhibited the growth of natural microflora and L. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions. Bacteriocinogenic LAB present in cheeses and yogurts may have potential to be used as biopreservatives in foods.
TI  - Fluorescent-BOX-PCR for resolving bacterial genetic diversity, endemism and biogeography.
AB  - BACKGROUND: BOX-A1R-based repetitive extragenic palindromic-PCR (BOX-PCR) is one  of the most used techniques in biogeography studies of microbial isolates. However the traditional separation of BOX-PCR patterns by agarose gel electrophoresis suffers many limitations. The aim of this research was to set up a fluorescent BOX-PCR (F-BOX-PCR) assay in which separation of PCR products is automated in a capillary electrophoresis system. F-BOX-PCR was compared with the traditional BOX-PCR using bacterial strains with different G+C content (Bacillus cereus; Escherichia coli; isolates of the family Geodermatophilaceae). Resolution, discriminatory power and reproducibility were evaluated by assaying different electrophoretic runs, PCR reactions and independent DNA extractions. BOX-PCR and F-BOX-PCR were compared for the analysis of 29 strains of Modestobacter multiseptatus isolated from three different microsites in an altered carbonatic wall from Cagliari, Italy, and 45 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus isolated from 34 samples of the hand-made, yogurt-like product Matsoni, collected in different locations in Georgia. RESULTS: Fluorophore 6-FAM proved more informative than HEX and BOX-PCR both in agarose gel electrophoresis (p < 0.004 and p < 0.00003) and in capillary electrophoresis (compared only with HEX, p < 2 x 10(-7)). 6-FAM- and HEX-based F-BOX-PCR respectively detected up to 12.0 and 11.3 times more fragments than BOX-PCR. Replicate separations of F-BOX-PCR showed an accuracy of the size calling of +/- 0.5 bp until 500 bp, constantly decreasing to +/- 10 bp at 2000 bp. Cluster analysis of F-BOX-PCR profiles grouped M. multiseptatus strains according to the microsite of isolation and S. thermophilus strains according to the geographical origin of Matsoni, but resulted intermixed when a BOX-PCR dataset was used. CONCLUSION: F-BOX-PCR represents an improved method for addressing bacterial biogeography studies both in term of sensitivity, reproducibility and data analysis.
TI  - Characterization of a bacteriocin, Thermophilin 1277, produced by Streptococcus thermophilus SBT1277.
AB  - AIMS: To assess the inhibitory activity and the influence of culture condition on the growth and bacteriocin, Thermophilin 1277, production by Streptococcus thermophilus SBT1277. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thermophilin 1277, which was produced by S. thermophilus SBT1277, showed an antimicrobial activity against several lactic acid bacteria and food spoilage bacteria including Clostridium butylicum, C. sprogenes and Bacillus cereus. Thermophilin 1277 was inactivated by proteinase K. Heating treatment did not affect the antimicrobial activity. The partially purified Thermophilin 1277 had an apparent molecular mass of 3.7 kDa. N-terminal sequence analysis revealed 15 amino acid residues that correspond with amino acid sequence of the lantibiotics bovicin HJ50 produced by Streptococcus bovis HJ50. The effects of culture condition for the bacteriocin production by S. thermophilus SBT1277 were studied. During the batch fermentation, Thermophilin 1277 was produced in M17 broth, but no bacteriocin production occurred in the sucrose-tryptone (ST) broth. Bacteriocin production was detected in pH controlled ST broth at pH values of 5.5-6.5. CONCLUSIONS: Thermophilin 1277 production from S. thermophilus strain depended on the culture conditions. Some characters and N-terminal amino acid sequence of Thermophilin 1277 differed from bacteriocins produced by S. thermophilus reported previously. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Streptococcus thermophilus SBT1277 or its bacteriocin which has a wide inhibitory spectrum has a potential use as a biopreservative in dairy products.
TI  - Isolation of a minireplicon of the virulence plasmid pXO2 of Bacillus anthracis and characterization of the plasmid-encoded RepS replication protein.
AB  - A minireplicon of plasmid pXO2 of Bacillus anthracis was isolated by molecular cloning in Escherichia coli and shown to replicate in B. anthracis, Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus subtilis. The pXO2 replicon included (i) an open reading frame encoding the putative RepS replication initiation protein and (ii) the putative origin of replication. The RepS protein was expressed as a fusion with the maltose binding protein (MBP) at its amino-terminal end and purified by affinity chromatography. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the purified MBP-RepS protein bound specifically to a 60-bp region corresponding to the putative origin of replication of pXO2 located immediately downstream of the RepS open reading frame. Competition DNA binding experiments showed that the 5' and central regions of the putative origin were important for RepS binding. MBP-RepS also bound nonspecifically to single-stranded DNA with a lower affinity.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of commercial annatto extracts against selected pathogenic, lactic acid, and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  - Annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. There are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. However, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. This study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. Disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the MICs and MBCs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. Standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. The results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Staphylococcus aureus, with MICs of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. A concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, Lactococcus lactis, and Paenibacillus polymyxa. The MICs for Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. No activity was detected against Lactobacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Challenge testing of the lactoperoxidase system in pasteurized milk.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the role of lactoperoxidase (LP) in inhibiting the growth of micro-organisms in pasteurised milk. METHODS AND RESULTS: Four micro-organisms of importance in the spoilage of pasteurized milk were challenged in lactoperoxidase (LP)-enriched ultra-heat treated (UHT) milk after subsequent pasteurization. Milk samples were stored at the optimum temperatures for growth of the individual bacteria. Pasteurization was carried out at 72 degrees C/15 s and 80 degrees C/15 s to determine the effect of the LP system on the micro-organisms. An active LP system was found to greatly increase the keeping quality (KQ) of milks inoculated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus thermophilus and pasteurized at 72 degrees C, but had little or no effect in milks heated at 80 degrees C, presumably due to virtual inactivation of LP at 80 degrees C. However, pasteurization temperature had no effect on the KQ of milks challenged with Bacillus cereus spores. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the LP system, rather than heat-shocking of spores, is responsible for the greater KQ of milk pasteurized at 72 degrees C/15 s compared with 80 degrees C/15 s. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The study emphasizes the care required in selecting pasteurization temperatures in commercial practice and to avoid the temptation to compensate for inferior quality of raw milk by increasing pasteurization temperature.
TI  - Enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  - Enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against Ent. faecalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. sake, Listeria innocua, Propionibacterium acidipropionici, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium. One of the four pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. No antimicrobial activity was recorded against Bacillus cereus, Cl. sporogenes, Cl. tyrobutyricum, Leuconostoc cremoris, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus carnosus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to Proteinase K, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. Treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. Half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees C for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a pH of 1.0-5.0 and pH 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. Enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 AU ml-1, but increased further to 1600 AU ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. The peptide is approximately 3.4 kDa in size, as determined after partial purification with Amberlite XAD-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The mechanism of antimicrobial activity against Lact. sake LMG 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
TI  - Inhibition of Clostridium tyrobutyricum by bacteriocin-like substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were selected for their inhibitory activity against Clostridium tyrobutyricum under conditions that eliminate the effects of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide. Four strains were isolated belonging to the species Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. The sensitivity of the inhibitory substances to pronase and trypsine indicates that they are proteins or peptides different from nisin. Their resistance to phospholipase D indicates that they are also different from lactostrepcin. The inhibitory substances are produced during the exponential phase of growth. Their activity is bactericidal and directed toward some strains of Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Streptococcus thermophilus, but strains used as dairy starters, Lactobacillus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Propionibacterium shermanii, are not all affected by the inhibition.
TI  - Effects of Lactic Acid Bacteria and Organic Acids on Growth and Germination of Bacillus cereus.
AB  - Growth and germination of vegetative cells and endospores of Bacillus cereus were affected by Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus in nonfat milk medium and by salts of organic acids in broth medium. Growth of the lactic acid bacteria was not affected by B. cereus. B. cereus increased rapidly to about 10 CFU/ml when cells were added at the beginning of growth of lactic acid bacteria; it was inactivated slowly when added after 24 h and rapidly when added after 72 h of lactic acid bacterial growth. Streptococci were more inhibitory to the growth of B. cereus than lactobacilli were at 24 h. Spore germination was not affected after 24 h, but it was inhibited after 48 and 72 h of lactic acid bacterial growth. Acetate was more inhibitory to the growth of vegetative cells, while formate was more inhibitory to spore germination. Acetate, formate, and lactate (all at 0.1 M) completely inactivated multiplication of B. cereus at pH 6.1, 6.0, and 5.6, respectively. Spores of B. cereus were more resistant to these organic acids compared with the resistance of vegetative cells. Formate, lactate, and acetate (all at 0.1 M) caused 50% inhibition of spore germination at pH 4.4, 4.3, and 4.2, respectively.
TI  - Use of microbial beta-lactamase to destroy penicillin added to milk.
AB  - A simple method is described for destruction of penicillin residues in bulk milk  to an undetectable amount (less than .003 U/ml) with commercially available crude beta-lactamase enzyme. Milk containing .1 or .5 U/ml penicillin G was treated with .01 to 1.0 mU/ml of beta-lactamase (Bacillus cereus) for up to 96 h. The Bacillus stearothermophilus var. calidolactis assay was used to quantify penicillin in milk between .003 to 1.0 U/ml. The .5 U/ml of penicillin G was reduced to an undetectable amount within 18 h at 4 degrees C by 1.0 mU/ml of beta-lactamase. The development of titratable acidity over 5 to 6 h in contaminated milks treated with beta-lactamase and inoculated with Streptococcus thermophilus GH, Streptococcus cremoris, Streptococcus lactis, or a commercial starter culture was the same as for control milk samples containing no additives or only enzyme. Pilot-scale manufacture of Swiss and Cheddar cheeses from contaminated milks treated with beta-lactamase yielded cheeses of comparable quality, to control cheeses produced from penicillin-free milk. There were no delays in acid production as judged from pH measurements during production and ripening of the cheeses. About 50% of beta-lactamase activity added to milk remained after pasteurization at 63 degrees C for 30 min. The safety for human consumption of cheese containing small quantities of penicillin degradation products from milk treated with beta-lactamase remains to be established.
