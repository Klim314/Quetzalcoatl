TI  == research into acetone removal from air by biofiltration using a biofilter with straight structure plates.
AB  == the biological air treatment method is based on the biological destruction of organic compounds using certain cultures of microorganisms. this method is simple and may be applied in many branches of industry. the main element of biological air treatment devices is a filter charge. tests were carried out using a new-generation laboratory air purifier with a plate structure. this purifier is called biofilter. the biofilter has a special system for packing material humidification which does not require additional energy inputs. in order to extend the packing material's durability, it was composed of thermally treated birch fibre. pollutant (acetone) biodegradation occurred on thermally treated wood fibre in this research. according to the performed tests and the received results, the process of biodestruction was highly efficient. when acetone was passed through biofilter's packing material at 0.08 m s-1 rate, the efficiency of the biofiltration process was from 70% up to 90%. the species of bacteria capable of removing acetone vapour from the air, i.e. bacillus (b. cereus, b. subtilis),  pseudomonas (p. aeruginosa, p. putida), stapylococcus (s. aureus) and rhodococcus sp., was identified in this study during the process of biofiltration. their amount in the biological packing material changed from 1.6 x 107 to 3.7 x 1011 cfu g-1.

TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in seri kembangan, malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  == this study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around seri kembangan, a city in malaysia. pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of otus with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). proteobacteria, firmicutes and bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (otus) observed across all samples. the highest appearance frequencies (100%) were otus closely related to enterobacter sp., enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas sp. and pseudomonas putida. several otus were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including bacillus cereus, cronobacter sakazaki, cronobacter turisensis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, hafnia alvei, kurthia gibsonii, salmonella bongori, salmonella enterica, salmonella paratyphi, salmonella tyhpi, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. the condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.

TI  == dechlorination of chloroorganics, decolorization, and simultaneous bioremediation of cr6+ from real tannery effluent employing indigenous bacillus cereus isolate.
AB  == a native bacillus cereus isolate has been employed, for the first time, for simultaneous decolorization, dechlorination of chloroorganics, and cr(6+) remediation from the real tannery effluent. most of the physicochemical variables in 3:1 diluted effluent were well above the standard prescribed limits, which decreased substantially upon microbial treatment. the extent of bioremediation was better in diluted (3:1) as compared to undiluted effluent supplemented with nutrients and augmented with b. cereus isolate. maximum growth, effluent decolorization (42.5 %), dechlorination (74.1 %), and cr(6+) remediation (34.2 %) were attained with 4.0 % (v/v) inoculum, 0.8 % glucose, and 0.2 % ammonium chloride in 3:1 diluted effluent at natural ph (8.1) within 72 h of incubation. the efficiency of bioremediation in a bioreactor was higher as compared to a flask trial during 72 h of incubation: decolorization (47.9 %) was enhanced by 5.4 %, dechlorination (77.4 %) by 3.3 %, and cr(6+) removal (41.7 %) by 7.5 % at  an initial color of 286 pt-co units and initial concentration of 62 mg chloride ions and 108 mg l(-1) cr(6+). immobilized biomass of pseudomonas putida and b. cereus coculture enhanced the extent of cr(6+) remediation (51.9 %) by 10.2 % compared to the bioreactor trial. chromate reductase activity and reduced cr directly correlated and were mainly associated with soluble fraction of b. cereus plus effluent natural microflora. the gc-ms analyses revealed the formation of metabolites such as acetic acid and 2-butenoic acid in bacterially treated effluent. the supplementation of nutrients along with b. cereus augmentation is required for efficient effluent bioremediation.

TI  == identification of 3-sulfinopropionyl coenzyme a (coa) desulfinases within the acyl-coa dehydrogenase superfamily.
AB  == in a previous study, the essential role of 3-sulfinopropionyl coenzyme a (3sp-coa) desulfinase acyl-coa dehydrogenase (acd) in advenella mimigardefordensis strain dpn7(t) (acddpn7) during degradation of 3,3'-dithiodipropionic acid (dtdp) was elucidated. dtdp is a sulfur-containing precursor substrate for biosynthesis of polythioesters (ptes). acddpn7 showed high amino acid sequence similarity to acyl-coa dehydrogenases but was unable to  catalyze a dehydrogenation reaction. hence, it was investigated in the present study whether 3sp-coa desulfinase activity is an uncommon or a widespread property within the acyl-coa dehydrogenase superfamily. therefore, proteins of the acyl-coa dehydrogenase superfamily from advenella kashmirensis wt001, bacillus cereus dsm31, cupriavidus necator n-1, escherichia coli bl21, pseudomonas putida kt2440, burkholderia xenovorans lb400, ralstonia eutropha h16, variovorax paradoxus b4, variovorax paradoxus s110, and variovorax paradoxus tbea6 were expressed in e. coli strains. all purified acyl-coa dehydrogenases appeared as homotetramers, as revealed by size exclusion chromatography. acds110, acdb4, acdh16, and acdkt2440 were able to dehydrogenate isobutyryl-coa. acdkt2440 additionally dehydrogenated butyryl-coa and valeryl-coa, whereas acddsm31 dehydrogenated only butyryl-coa and valeryl-coa. no dehydrogenation reactions were observed with propionyl-coa, isovaleryl-coa, succinyl-coa, and glutaryl-coa  for any of the investigated acyl-coa dehydrogenases. only acdtbea6, acdn-1, and acdlb400 desulfinated 3sp-coa and were thus identified as 3sp-coa desulfinases within the acyl-coa dehydrogenase family, although none of these three acds dehydrogenated any of the tested acyl-coa thioesters. no appropriate substrates were identified for acdbl21 and acdwt001. spectrophotometric assays provided apparent km and vmax values for active substrates and indicated the applicability of phylogenetic analyses to predict the substrate range of uncharacterized acyl-coa dehydrogenases. furthermore, c. necator n-1 was found to utilize 3sp as  the sole source of carbon and energy.

TI  == influence of inoculation with plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (pgpr) on tomato plant growth and nematode reproduction under greenhouse conditions.
AB  == numerous species of soil bacteria which flourish in the rhizosphere of plants or  around plant tissues stimulate plant growth and reduce nematode population by antagonistic behavior. these bacteria are collectively known as pgpr (plant growth promoting rhizobacteria). the effects of six isolates of pgpr pseudomonas  putida, pseudomonas fluorescens, serratia marcescens, bacillus amyloliquefaciens, bacillus subtilis and bacillus cereus, were studied on tomato plant growth and root knot nematode reproduction after 45 days from nematode infection. the highest number of shoot dry weight/g (43.00 g) was detected in the plant treated  with s. marcescens; then p. putida (34.33 g), b. amyloliquefaciens (31.66 g), p.  fluorescens (30.0 g), b. subtilis (29.0 g), b. cereus (27.0 g) and nematode alone (untreated) 20 g/plant. while the highest number of plant height was observed when plant was treated with s. marcescens, p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. amyloliquefaciens and p. putida 52.66, 50.66, 48 and 48 cm respectively. no significant differences were seen between previous treatments but only had significant differences compared with untreated plant. the highest number of fruit/plant was observed when plants were treated with s. marcescens (10.66), then b. amyloliquefaciens (8.66), p. putida (8), p. fluorescens (8) and b. cereus (7.66). no significant differences between the last 4 treatments, but all had significant differences compared with untreated plants. the highest weight of plant yield (g) was observed with s. marcescens (319.6 g/plant) and the lowest weight of plant yield was observed in plants treated with nematode alone (untreated). on the other hand, the lowest numbers of j2/10 g of soil (78), galls/root, (24.33) galls/root, egg masses/root (12.66) and egg/egg masses were observed in the plants treated with s. marcescens.

TI  == community composition and cellulase activity of cellulolytic bacteria from forest soils planted with broad-leaved deciduous and evergreen trees.
AB  == cellulolytic bacteria in forest soil provide carbon sources to improve the soil fertility and sustain the nutrient balance of the forest ecological system through the decomposition of cellulosic remains. these bacteria can also be utilized for the biological conversion of biomass into renewable biofuels. in this study, the community compositions and activities of cellulolytic bacteria in the soils of forests planted with broad-leaved deciduous (chang qing garden, cqg) and broad-leaved evergreen (forest park, fp) trees in wuhan, china were resolved  through restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) and sequencing analysis of the 16s rrna gene. all of the isolates exhibited 35 rflp fingerprint patterns  and were clustered into six groups at a similarity level of 50 %. the phylogeny analysis based on the 16s rrna gene sequence revealed that these rflp groups could be clustered into three phylogenetic groups and further divided into six subgroups at a higher resolution. group i consists of isolates from bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis complex (i-a) and from paenibacillus amylolyticus-related complex (i-b) and exhibited the highest cellulase activity among all of the cellulolytic bacteria isolates. cluster ii consists of isolates  belonging to microbacterium testaceum (ii-a), chryseobacterium indoltheticum (ii-b), and flavobacterium pectinovorum and the related complex (ii-c). cluster iii consists of isolates belonging to pseudomonas putida-related species. the community shift with respect to the plant species and the soil properties was evidenced by the phylogenetic composition of the communities. groups i-a and i-b, which account for 36.0 % of the cellulolytic communities in the cqg site, are the dominant groups (88.4 %) in the fp site. alternatively, the ratio of the bacteria belonging to group iii (p. putida-related isolates) shifted from 28.0 % in cqg to 4.0 % in fp. the soil nutrient analysis revealed that the cqg site planted with deciduous broad-leaved trees has a richer organic nutrient (total organic carbon  and total nitrogen) than the fp site planted with evergreen broad-leaved trees. against this background, the population density and the diversity of cellulolytic bacteria in the cqg site are clearly higher than those in the fp site, and the latter was dominated with high-cellulase-activity bacillus- and paenibacillus-related bacteria. the canonical correspondence analysis further indicated that the distribution of these groups is correlated with the fp site, whereas groups ii and iii are correlated with the organic nutrient-rich cqg site.

TI  == anti-biofilm forming and anti-quorum sensing activity of selected essential oils  and their main components on food-related micro-organisms.
AB  == aims: the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of clary sage, juniper, lemon and marjoram essential oils (eos) and their major components on the formation of bacterial and yeast biofilms and on the inhibition of ahl-mediated quorum sensing (qs). methods and results: biofilm formation was measured by crystal violet and resazurin staining, and qs inhibition was detected by paper disc diffusion assay. marjoram eo inhibited bacillus cereus, pichia anomala, pseudomonas putida and mixed-culture biofilm formation of ps. putida and escherichia coli and showed the best qs inhibitor effect on chromobacterium violaceum. for b. cereus, all components showed better antibiofilm capacity than  the parent eos. lemon eo inhibited e. coli and mixed-culture biofilms, and cinnamon was effective against the mixed forms. scanning electron microscopy showed the loss of three-dimensional structures of biofilms. conclusions: the eos and components used seem to be good candidates for prevention of biofilm formation and inhibition of the ahl-mediated qs mechanism. significance and impact of the study: biofilm formation on foods and food industrial equipment is  a serious problem causing food spoilage and emergence of foodborne diseases. this article highlights the importance of studying eos as potential disinfectants and  food preservatives.

TI  == novel polymer anchored cr(iii) schiff base complexes: synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial properties.
AB  == new polymer-bound schiff bases and cr(iii) complexes have been synthesized by the reaction of 4-benzyloxybenzaldehyde, polymer-bound with 2-aminophenol, 2-amino-4-chlorophenol and 2-amino-4-methylphenol. the structure of polymeric-schiff bases and their cr(iii) complexes have been characterized by elemental analyses, magnetic measurements, ir, uv-vis, tg-dta and (1)h-nmr. all these compounds have also been investigated for antibacterial activity by the well-diffusion method against staphylococcus aureus (rskk-07035), shigella dysenteria type 10 (rskk 1036), listeria monocytogenes 4b(atcc 19115, escherichia coli (atcc 1230), salmonella typhi h (nctc 901.8394), staphylococcus epidermis (atcc 12228), brucella abortus (rskk-03026), micrococcs luteus (atcc 93419, bacillus cereus sp., pseudomonas putida sp. and for antifungal activity against candida albicans (y-1200-nih).

TI  == diversity of bacterial communities that colonize the filter units used for controlling plant pathogens in soilless cultures.
AB  == in recent years, increasing the level of suppressiveness by the addition of antagonistic bacteria in slow filters has become a promising strategy to control  plant pathogens in the recycled solutions used in soilless cultures. however, knowledge about the microflora that colonize the filtering columns is still limited. in order to get information on this issue, the present study was carried out over a 4-year period and includes filters inoculated or not with suppressive  bacteria at the start of the filtering process (two or three filters were used each year). after 9 months of filtration, polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-single  strand conformation polymorphism analyses point out that, for the same year of experiment, the bacterial communities from control filters were relatively similar but that they were significantly different between the bacteria-amended and control filters. to characterize the changes in bacterial communities within  the filters, this microflora was studied by quantitative pcr, community-level physiological profiles, and sequencing 16srrna clone libraries (filters used in year 1). quantitative pcr evidenced a denser bacterial colonization of the p-filter (amended with pseudomonas putida strains) than control and b-filter (amended with bacillus cereus strains). functional analysis focused on the cultivable bacterial communities pointed out that bacteria from the control filter metabolized more carbohydrates than those from the amended filters whose trophic behaviors were more targeted towards carboxylic acids and amino acids. the bacterial communities in p- and b-filters both exhibited significantly more phylotype diversity and markedly distinct phylogenetic compositions than those in the c-filter. although there were far fewer proteobacteria in b- and p-filters than in the c-filter (22% and 22% rather than 69% of sequences, respectively), the percentages of firmicutes was much higher (44% and 55% against 9%, respectively). many pseudomonas species were also found in the bacterial communities of the control filter. the persistence of the amended suppressive-bacteria in the filters is discussed with regards to the management of suppressive microflora in soilless culture.

TI  == the potential for reductive mobilization of arsenic [as(v) to as(iii)] by osbh(2) (pseudomonas stutzeri) and osbh(5) (bacillus cereus) in an oil-contaminated site.
AB  == microbial reduction of arsenate [as(v)] plays an important role in arsenic (as) mobilization in aqueous environments. in this study, we investigated reduction of arsenate by different bacterial isolates such as osbh(1) (gu329913), osbh(2) (gu329914), osbh(3) (gu329915), osbh(4) (gu329916) and osbh(5) (gu329917), isolated from the oil sludge of a sewage treatment plant operated by the china petroleum refinery company in kaohsiung, southern taiwan. bacterial strains of pure culture were identified by 16s rrna analysis (>/=99 % nucleotide similarity). morphological and 16s rrna analysis show that the isolate osbh(1) is similar to e. coli, osbh(2) is similar to p. stutzeri, osbh(3) is similar to p. putida, osbh(4) is similar to p. aeruginosa, and osbh(5) is similar to b. cereus. the as(v) was transformed to as(iii) in the presence of isolates osbh(2) and osbh(5) by a detoxification process. the potential reduction rates of as(v) were  higher in the presence of isolate osbh(5) compared to the isolate osbh(2). the microbial growth (cell/ml) of isolate osbh(5) was significantly higher in culture medium compared to osbh(2). the bacterial isolates such as osbh(1), osbh(3) and osbh(4) were found to be incapable of transforming the as(v). it is concluded that the activity of the oil-degrading bacterial isolates described in this work  contributes to the mobilization of as in the more toxic as(iii) form that affects biotic life.

TI  == aerobic degradation of 2,4-dinitrotoluene by individual bacterial strains and defined mixed population in submerged cultures.
AB  == the degradation efficiencies of isomeric mononitrotoluenes (2- and 4-nts) and dinitrotoluenes (2,4-dnt and 2,6-dnt) by either individual bacterial strains (bacillus cereus ndt4, pseudomonas putida ndt1, pseudomonas fluorescens ndt2, and achromobacter sp. ndt3) or their mixture were compared in submerged batch cultivations. the mixed culture degraded 2,4-dnt nearly 50 times faster than any  of the individual strains. the mixed culture also demonstrated significantly shorter lag periods in 2,4-dnt degradation, a lack of nitrite or organic intermediates accumulation in the liquid medium and the ability to degrade a broader spectrum of nitrotoluenes over a wider concentration range. the presence  of both readily degradable 2-nt (or 4-nt) and poorly degradable 2,6-dnt in the medium negatively affected 2,4-dnt biodegradation. however, the mixed bacterial culture still effectively degraded 2,4-dnt with only slightly lower rates under these unfavorable conditions, thus showing potential for the remediation of 2,4-dnt contaminated sites.

TI  == evidence of induced systemic resistance against botrytis elliptica in lily.
AB  == lily leaf blight, caused by botrytis elliptica, is an important fungal disease in taiwan. in order to identify an effective, nonfungicide method to decrease disease incidence in lilium formosanum, the efficacy of rhizobacteria eliciting induced systemic resistance (isr) was examined in this study. over 300 rhizobacteria were isolated from the rhizosphere of l. formosanum healthy plants  and 63 were identified by the analysis of fatty acid profiles. disease suppressive ability of 13 strains was demonstrated by soil drench application of  bacterial suspensions to the rhizosphere of l. formosanum seedlings. biocontrol experiments were carried out with bacillus cereus and pseudomonas putida strains  on l. formosanum and lilium oriental hybrid cvs. acapulco and star gazer in greenhouse and field studies. plants treated with b. cereus strain c1l showed that protection against b. elliptica on l. formosanum could last for at least 10  days and was consistent with high populations of b. cereus on lily roots. analysis of the expression of lfgrp1 and lsgrp1, encoding glycine-rich protein associated with l. formosanum and cv. star gazer, respectively, revealed different responses induced by b. cereus or by the pathogen b. elliptica, suggesting that plant defense responses elicited by each follows a different signaling pathway. according to the results of biocontrol assays and lfgrp1/lsgrp1 gene expression analyses with culture filtrates of b. cereus strain c1l, we propose that eliciting factors of isr are generated by b. cereus and some of them exhibit thermostable and heat-tolerant traits. this is the first report about isr-eliciting rhizobacteria and factors effective for foliar disease suppression in lily.

TI  == antibacterial activity of guava (psidium guajava l.) and neem (azadirachta indica a. juss.) extracts against foodborne pathogens and spoilage bacteria.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of guava (psidium guajava) and neem (azadirachta indica) extracts against 21 strains of foodborne pathogens were determined--listeria monocytogenes (five strains), staphylococcus aureus (four strains), escherichia coli o157:h7 (six strains), salmonella enteritidis (four strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus, and bacillus cereus, and five food spoilage bacteria: pseudomonas aeroginosa, p. putida, alcaligenes faecalis, and aeromonas  hydrophila (two strains). guava and neem extracts showed higher antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria compared to gram-negative bacteria except for v. parahaemolyticus, p. aeroginosa, and a. hydrophila. none of the extracts showed antimicrobial activity against e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella enteritidis. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of ethanol extracts of guava showed the highest inhibition for l. monocytogenes jcm 7676 (0.1 mg/ml), s. aureus jcm 2151 (0.1 mg/ml), s. aureus jcm 2179 (0.1 mg/ml), and v. parahaemolyticus ifo 12711 (0.1 mg/ml) and the lowest inhibition for alcaligenes faecalis ifo 12669, aeromonas hydrophila nfri 8282 (4.0 mg/ml), and a. hydrophila nfri 8283 (4.0 mg/ml). the mic of chloroform extracts of neem showed similar inhibition for l. monocytogenes atcc 43256 (4.0 mg/ml) and l. monocytogenes atcc 49594 (5.0 mg/ml). however, ethanol extracts of neem showed higher inhibition for s. aureus jcm 2151 (4.5 mg/ml) and s. aureus ifo 13276 (4.5 mg/ml) and the lower inhibition for other microorganisms (6.5 mg/ml). no significant effects of temperature and ph were found on guava and neem extracts against cocktails of l. monocytogenes and s. aureus. the results of the present study suggest that guava and neem extracts  possess compounds containing antibacterial properties that can potentially be useful to control foodborne pathogens and spoilage organisms.

TI  == establishment and characterization of dual-species biofilms formed from a 3,5-dinitrobenzoic-degrading strain and bacteria with high biofilm-forming capabilities.
AB  == in this study, the possibility of establishing a dual-species biofilm from a bacterium with a high biofilm-forming capability and a 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid (3,5-dnba)-degrading bacterium, comamonas testosteroni a3, was investigated. our  results showed that the combinations of strain a3 with each of five strains with  a high biofilm-forming capability (pseudomonas sp. m8, pseudomonas putida m9, bacillus cereus m19, pseudomonas plecoglossicida m21 and aeromonas hydrophila m22) presented different levels of enhancement regarding biofilm-forming capability. among these culture combinations, the 24-h dual-species biofilms established by c. testosteroni a3 with p. putida m9 and a. hydrophila m22 showed  the strongest resistance to 3,5-dnba shock loading, as demonstrated by six successive replacements with dmm2 synthetic wastewater. the degradation rates of  3,5-dnba by these two culture combinations reached 63.3-91.6% and 70.7-89.4%, respectively, within 6 h of every replacement. using the gfp-tagged strain m22 and confocal laser scanning microscopy, the immobilization of a3 cells in the dual-species biofilm was confirmed. we thus demonstrated that, during wastewater  treatment processes, it is possible to immobilize degrader bacteria with bacteria with a high biofilm-forming capability and to enable them to develop into the mixed microbial flora. this may be a simple and economical method that represents a novel strategy for effective bioaugmentation.

TI  == characterization of bacillus and pseudomonas strains with suppressive traits isolated from tomato hydroponic-slow filtration unit.
AB  == bacillus and pseudomonas spp. are known to be involved in plant pathogenic fungi  elimination during the slow filtration process used in tomato soilless cultures.  we isolated 6-8 strains of both bacillus and pseudomonas from the top, middle, and bottom sections of filters and identified them after 16s rdna sequencing. four pseudomonas strains were identified as pseudomonas fulva, 5 as pseudomonas plecoglossicida, and 12 as pseudomonas putida. the use of specific oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction primer sets designed from gyrb gene sequences additionally permitted the identification of 17 bacillus cereus and 3 bacillus thuringiensis strains. ribotyping with ecori pointed out an important polymorphism within bacillus and pseudomonas strains. molecular characterization  did not reveal a correlation between the location of isolates within the filter (top, middle, or bottom) and bacterial identification or riboclusters. functional aspects assessed by community-level physiological profiling showed marked phenotypic differences between pseudomonas communities isolated from the top and  bottom filter layers; differences were lower between bacillus communities of different layers and far less noticeable between mixed communities of bacillus and pseudomonas. these strains were tested for several suppressive activities. conversely to most bacillus, the majority of pseudomonas strains were auxin producers and promoted the growth of tomato plantlet roots. on the other hand, only bacillus strains displayed antagonistic activities by inhibiting the growth  of pathogenic fungi frequently detected in soilless cultures. siderophores were produced by nearly all bacteria, but at higher amounts by pseudomonas than bacillus strains. the biocontrol agent potentiality of certain strains to optimize the slow filtration process and to promote the suppressive potential of  nutrient solution is discussed.

TI  == mycorrhizal fungi and ectomycorrhiza associated bacteria isolated from an industrial desert soil protect pine seedlings against cd(ii) impact.
AB  == effects of mycorrhization with amanita rubescens or hebeloma sinapizans and dual  inoculation with the fungi and ectomycorrhiza associated bacteria (emab) pseudomonas putida or bacillus cereus on seedling growth and accumulation of cd(ii) in pinus sylvestris were studied. both fungal and bacterial species were isolated from roots of pines growing in an industrial area polluted with high concentrations of heavy metals. during mycorrhization, a. rubescens colonized higher number of pine seedlings than h. sinapizans, especially when emab were co-inoculated. in addition, the seedling biometric characteristics (i.e. root and shoot lengths and biomass) were stimulated by treatment with the fungal species alone and dual inoculation with the fungi and emab. amanita rubescens was more efficient in this stimulation than h. sinapizans. the increased growth of pine seedlings was especially seen for co-inoculation with p. putida. furthermore, elevated accumulation of cd(ii), ranging from 56 microg g(-1) to 72 microg g(-1)  dry weight, in underground parts of the inoculated seedlings was found. the seedlings treated with a. rubescens accumulated higher concentrations of the metal than those inoculated with h. sinapizans. additional treatment of pine seedlings with p. putida resulted in the higher accumulation of cd(ii) in the roots as compared with those inoculated with b. cereus. the results suggest that  the growth of pine seedlings in cd(ii)-polluted soil may depend on fungal species forming ectomycorrhizae, species-specific co-inoculation with emab and specificity of fungal-emab interactions.

TI  == indigenous bacteria with antagonistic and plant-growth-promoting activities improve slow-filtration efficiency in soilless cultivation.
AB  == in tomato soilless culture, slow filtration allows one to control the development of diseases caused by pathogenic microorganisms. during the disinfecting process, microbial elimination is ensured by mechanical and biological factors. in this study, system efficacy was enhanced further to a biological activation of filter  by inoculating the pozzolana grains contained in the filtering unit with 5 selected bacteria. three strains identified as pseudomonas putida and 2 as bacillus cereus came from a filter whose high efficiency to eliminate pathogens has been proven over years. these 5 bacteria displayed either a plant growth promoting activity (p. putida strains) or antagonistic properties (b. cereus strains). over the first months following their introduction in the filter, the bacterial colonisation of pozzolana grains was particularly high as compared to the one observed in the control filter. conversely to bacillus spp. populations,  pseudomonas spp. ones remained abundant throughout the whole cultural season. the biological activation of filter unit very significantly enhanced fungal elimination with respect to the one displayed by the control filter. indeed, the  6-month period needed by the control filter to reach its best efficacy against fusarium oxysporum was shortened for the bacteria-amended filter; in addition, a  high efficacy filtration was got as soon as the first month. fast colonization of pozzolana grains by selected bacteria and their subsequent interaction with f. oxysporum are likely responsible for filter efficiency. our results suggest that  pseudomonas spp. act by competition for nutrients, and bacillus spp. by antibiosis and (or) direct parasitism. elimination of other fungal pathogens, i.e., pythium spp., seems to differ from that of fusarium since both filters demonstrated a high efficacy at the experiment start. pythium spp. elimination appears to mainly rely on physical factors. it is worth noting that a certain percentage of the 5 pozzolana-inoculated bacteria failed to colonise the filter unit and were, thus, driven to the plants by the nutrient solution. their contribution to the establishment of a beneficial microbial community in the rhizosphere is discussed.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of eucalyptus leaf extracts and flavonoids from eucalyptus maculata.
AB  == aims: we investigated the antimicrobial activities of eucalyptus leaf extracts to find effective antibacterial agents. methods and results: the antimicrobial activities of leaf extracts from 26 species of eucalyptus were measured. extracts of eucalyptus globulus, e. maculata and e. viminalis significantly inhibited the  growth of six gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, mrsa, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, propionibacterium acnes), and of a fungus (trichophyton mentagrophytes), but they did not show strong antibacterial activity against gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida). 2',6'-dihydroxy-3'-methyl-4'-methoxy-dihydrochalcone, eucalyptin and 8-desmethyl-eucalyptin, isolated from e. maculata extracts, exhibited potent antimicrobial activities against seven micro-organisms with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) ranging from 1.0 to 31 mg l(-1). conclusions: the eucalyptus extracts and three compounds from e. maculata were found to be effective against  micro-organisms that cause food poisoning, acne and athlete's foot. significance  and impact of the study: this study shows potential uses of extracts from e. globulus, e. maculata and e. viminalis, and antimicrobial compounds isolated from e. maculata.

TI  == cytoplasmic membrane polarization in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria grown in the absence and presence of tetracycline.
AB  == the ability of numerous diverse compounds and ions to cross the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane by diffusion and active transport is highly dependent on cytoplasmic membrane fluidity, which can be measured using fluorescent probes to  estimate membrane polarization values. however, membrane polarization data are lacking for most bacterial species. the cytoplasmic membrane polarization values  for arthrobacter sp. atcc 21908, bacillus cereus nrc 3045, pseudomonas fluorescens r2f, pseudomonas putida nrc 2986 and escherichia coli c600 bacterial  cells were spectrofluorometrically measured over a temperature range from 10 to 50 degrees c, and in the absence and presence of 1 microg/ml tetracycline, using  the fluorescent probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (dph) to obtain new information on their membrane fluidity. at an assay temperature of 10 degrees c,  e. coli cells grown in the absence of tetracycline exhibited the highest cytoplasmic membrane polarization value (least fluid membrane) of 0.446, followed by values of 0.392, 0.371, 0.344 and 0.293, respectively, for b. cereus, arthrobacter sp., p. fluorescens and p. putida. at an assay temperature of 30 degrees c, the polarization values ranged from 0.357 to 0.288 for cells grown in  the absence of tetracycline, regardless of the species. b. cereus grown in the presence of 1 microg/ml tetracycline had lower polarization values than when grown in the absence of this antibiotic at all assay temperatures. regardless of  the absence or presence of 1 microg/ml tetracycline in the growth medium, all bacterial species generally exhibited a more fluid membrane as the assay temperature increased from 10 to 50 degrees c. to our knowledge, these are some of the first cytoplasmic membrane polarization values reported for these gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria over a broad temperature range and also  for cells grown in the presence of tetracycline.

TI  == development of a rapid 1-h fluorescence-based cytotoxicity assay for listeria species.
AB  == listeria monocytogenes is cytotoxic to the lymphocyte-origin hybridoma ped-2e9 cell line. the relative cytotoxicity can be calculated by assaying the release of alkaline phosphatase (alp) from the infected cell line. in this study, a fluorogenic substrate (4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate, mup) was used to quantify  the alp activity. the assay is 3.5-fold more sensitive than the colorimetric-based assay and requires only 1 h to differentiate virulent from avirulent strains. in addition to various listeria species, 27 different common foodborne or clinical microorganisms were tested with the fluorescence-based cytotoxicity assay and only six cultures (bacillus cereus, citrobacter freundii,  serratia marcescens, pseudomonas putida, corynebacterium glutamicum and micrococcus luteus) showed cytotoxic effects similar to l. monocytogenes. to use  this assay as a confirmatory test for virulent l. monocytogenes suspect strains,  pure cultures must be isolated from the sample prior to testing.

TI  == analysis of whole bacterial cells by flow field-flow fractionation and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == the purpose of this study is to develop a novel bacterial analysis method by coupling the flow field-flow fractionation (flow fff) separation technique with detection by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry. the composition of carrier liquid used for flow fff was selected based on retention of bacterial cells and compatibility with the maldi process. the coupling of flow fff and maldi-tof ms was demonstrated for p.  putida and e. coli. fractions of the whole cells were collected after separation  by fff and further analyzed by maldi-ms. each fraction, collected over different  time intervals, corresponded to different sizes and possibly different growth stages of bacteria. the bacterial analysis by flow fff/maldi-tof ms was completed within 1 h with only preliminary optimization of the process.

TI  == mobility, bioavailability, and toxic effects of cadmium in soil samples.
AB  == total concentration is not a reliable indicator of metal mobility or bioavailability in soils. the physicochemical form determines the behavior of metals in soils and hence the toxicity toward terrestrial biota. the main objectives of this study were the application and comparison of three approaches  for the evaluation of cadmium behavior in soil samples. the mobility and bioavailability of cadmium in five selected soil samples were evaluated using equilibrium speciation (windermere humic aqueous model (wham)), extraction procedures (milli-q water, dmso, and dtpa), and a number of bioassays (microtox,  growth inhibition test, contact toxicity test, and respiration). the mobility, represented by the water-extractable fraction, corresponded well with the amount  of cadmium in the soil solution, calculated using the wham (r(2)=0.96, p<0.001).  the results of the ecotoxicological evaluation, which represent the bioavailable  fraction of cadmium, correlated well with dtpa extractability and also with the concentration of free cadmium ion, which is recognized as the most bioavailable metal form. the results of the wham as well as the results of extraction experiments showed a strong binding of cadmium to organic matter and a weak sorption of cadmium to clay minerals.

TI  == detection of bacterial dna in latin american patients with reactive arthritis by  polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analysis.
AB  == objective: bacteria and/or their antigens are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of reactive arthritis (rea). polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using the 16s ribosomal rna-pcr method was used to identify bacterial dna in synovial fluid (sf) and tissue (st) in a well defined group of patients with chronic rea.  in addition, species found were identified by means of sequence analysis. methods: we examined 15 st and 5 sf samples of 15 patients with rea, 5 st samples of 5 patients with osteoarthritis (oa), and 8 sf from 8 patients with closed traumatic knee injuries using a nested pcr with universal 16s rrna primers. in addition, a nested pcr was developed to detect dna sequences of salmonella sp. and mycoplasma sp. automated sequencing and comparative data analysis (genbank) were also performed to identify the species. results: bacterial dna was identified in 8 cases, 5 st and 3 sf; chlamydia trachomatis (n = 2), pseudomonas  sp. (n = 3), and bacillus cereus (n = 2) were the most common microorganisms identified. a variety of microorganisms including clostridium sp., lactobacillus  sp., pseudomonas migulae, p. fluorescens, and p. putida, and neisseria meningitidis serogroup b were also identified. in half of the cases (4/8) 2 to 3  bacterial antigens were identified simultaneously. conclusion: bacterial dna is present in the joints in patients with chronic rea. a wide spectrum of bacteria including some not previously associated with rea were identified. further studies are needed to establish their exact role in the pathogenesis of rea and related arthritides.

TI  == an algorithm for automated bacterial identification using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry.
AB  == an algorithm for bacterial identification using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (maldi) mass spectrometry is being developed. this mass spectral fingerprint comparison algorithm is fully automated and statistically based, providing objective analysis of samples to be identified. based on extraction of reference fingerprint ions from test spectra, this approach should  lend itself well to real-world applications where samples are likely to be impure. this algorithm is illustrated using a blind study. in the study, maldi-ms fingerprints for bacillus atrophaeus atcc 49337, bacillus cereus atcc 14579t, escherichia coli atcc 33694, pantoea agglomerans atcc 33243, and pseudomonas putida f1 are collected and form a reference library. the identification of test  samples containing one or more reference bacteria, potentially mixed with one species not in the library (shewanella alga bry), is performed by comparison to the reference library with a calculated degree of association. out of 60 samples, no false positives are present, and the correct identification rate is 75%. missed identifications are largely due to a weak b. cereus signal in the bacterial mixtures. potential modifications to the algorithm are presented and result in a higher than 90% correct identification rate for the blind study data, suggesting that this approach has the potential for reliable and accurate automated data analysis of maldi-ms.

TI  == bioremediation of phenol by alkaliphilic bacteria isolated from alkaline lake of  lonar, india.
AB  == phenol is an industrially important compound which has a wide range of applications. being highly soluble in water, it appears as the major pollutant in waste waters arising from both phenol manufacturing and from industrial units that utilise phenol. because of its toxicity, bioremediation of phenol is necessary. since some of the phenol-bearing industrial waste waters are alkaline  in nature, use of alkaliphilic bacteria for bioremediation of phenol was investigated. alkaliphilic bacteria were isolated from sediments of an alkaline lake in lonar, dist. buldhana, maharashtra state, india, by phenol enrichment at  ph 10.0 and phenol concentration of 500 mg/l. the lake (lat. 19 degrees 58'45", long. 76 degrees 34') is known to be a unique inland saline lake in asia. it has  a circular periphery and diameter of 2 km around the top of the banks and 1.2 km  at the bottom. the lake has a high saline level ( approximately 2649 mg/l sodium  chloride) and a high level of alkalinity ( approximately 2605 mg/l calcium carbonate). alkaliphilic strains of arthrobacter spp., bacillus cereus, citrobacter freundii, micrococcus agilis and pseudomonas putida biovar b were capable of removing phenol from waste waters arising from industries manufacturing methyl violet (using phenol as one of the major raw materials) and  cumene-phenol. the waste waters from both these units were alkaline in nature (ph approximately 9.95-10.1) and had a high phenol content (368-660 mg/l). the alkaliphilic bacteria being studied removed 100% of the phenol from the industrial waste waters within 48 h of incubation under shake culture conditions  and at an ambient temperature of 28 +/- 2 degrees c. bioremediation of phenol by  alkaliphilic strains of arthrobacter spp., b. cereus, c. freundii and m. agilis seems to be the first report.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of microgard against food spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == microgard, a commercially available fermented milk product containing antimicrobial metabolites, was a potent inhibitor for gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas, salmonella, and yersinia when 1% concentration was incorporated into agar media. gram-positive bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, and listeria monocytogenes were insensitive to microgard. kluyveromyces marxianus, an unidentified black yeast, and penicillium expansum were partially suppressed, whereas aspergillus niger and a yogurt spoilage yeast were tolerant to 5% microgard. optimum activity of microgard was at ph 5.3 and below; the concentration that gave complete inhibition depended upon the number of bacteria  present as well as the genus tested. blood agar base reversed the antagonistic activity of microgard against pseudomonas putida compared with plate count agar.

TI  == extracellular product of nocardia amarae induces bacterial cell flocculation.
AB  == the fact that nocardia amarae yk1 produced a bacterial flocculation-inducing substance (designated as fix) was discovered. fix had a function of flocculating  proliferous cells. fix-induced flocculation was inhibited by making cells resting, but not completely by adding chloramphenicol. fix worked widely on gram-positive to -negative bacteria. in the presence of fix, achromobacter cycloclastus iam1013, acinetobacter calcoaceticus iam1517, bacillus subtilis iam1069, escherichia coli c600-1, e. coli iam1239, flavobacterium lutescens iam1667, klebsiella pneumoniae iam1102, micrococcus luteus iam1313 and pseudomonas putida iam1002 formed flocs. b. cereus iam1029, however, exhibited no flocculation.

TI  == characterization of bacteria by particle beam mass spectrometry.
AB  == a technique is described for detecting and characterizing bacteria on a single-particle basis by mass spectrometry. the method involves generation of a particle beam of single whole cells which are rapidly volatilized and ionized in  vacuum in the ion source of a quadrupole mass spectrometer. the particle beam can be generated, with minimal sample handling, from a naturally occurring aerosol or from a solution of bacteria that can be dispersed as an aerosol. the mass spectrum is generated by successively measuring the average intensities of different mass peaks. the average intensity is obtained by measuring the ion intensity distribution at the particular mass (m/e) for ion pulses from more than 1,000 bacteria particles. bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, and pseudomonas putida samples were analyzed to test the capability of the instrument for differentiating among species of bacteria. significant ion-intensity information  was produced over the m/e range of 50 to 300, an improvement over previous pyrolysis-mass spectrometry results. the complex mass spectra contained a few unique peaks which could be used for the differentiation of the bacteria. a statistical analysis of the variations in peak intensities among the three bacteria provided a quantitative measure of the reproducibility of the instrument and its ability to differentiate among bacteria. the technique could lead to a new rapid method for the analysis of microorganisms and could be used for the detection of airborne pathogens on a continuous, real-time basis.

TI  == beta-casomorphin immunoreactive materials in cows' milk incubated with various bacterial species.
AB  == to obtain information about the possible release of beta-casomorphins from beta-casein under in vitro conditions, cows' milk was incubated with 13 strains of gram-negative or gram-positive bacterial species isolated from bovine milk. after incubation periods of 1-24 d, milk samples were assayed for beta-casomorphin-4, -5, -6 or -7 immunoreactive materials. in general, no beta-casomorphin immunoreactive material was found in samples incubated with non-caseolytic strains, e.g. pseudomonas putida or streptococcus faecalis subsp.  faecalis; however, high levels were found in several samples incubated with caseolytic strains, e.g. ps. aeruginosa or bacillus cereus. when such materials were present, the amounts of beta-casomorphin-4, -6 or -7 greatly exceeded beta-casomorphin-5 immunoreactivity. it was concluded that while some of these materials probably represented authentic beta-casomorphins, others were more likely to be beta-casomorphin precursors.

TI  == [microflora of active ooze participating in the decomposition of sulfanilic acid].
AB  == microflora of domestic water can be a source of active ooze adapted to sulphanilic acid. adaptation of the microflora to sulphanilic acid at a concentration of 170-200 mg/l takes 6 to 8 days. the microflora of active ooze, immediately after adaptation, consists mainly of pseudomonas species, ps. denitrificans, ps. fluorescens, ps. striata, ps. putida, etc., and also of achromobacter stutzeri, achromobacter flavum, mycobacterium phlei, mycobacterium  mucosum, bacillus mesentericus, bac. cereus, saccharomyces cerevisiae, schizosaccharomyces pombe, and rhodotorula glutinus. the number of the species decreased as a result of long cultivation of active ooze on a minimal medium with sulphanilic acid as a sole source of carbon and nitrogen; the following strains prevailed: ps. putida, ps. eisenbergii, strains of mycobacterium phlei and flavobacterium solare. the isolated strains of ps. putida and ps. eisenbergii decomposed sulphanilic acid by 60.0--79.5 percent, and together with mycobacterium phlei by 100 percent during 4 to 7 days. the ability to oxidize sulphanilic acid decreased after storage. addition to the medium of other sources of carbon, nitrogen and vitamins did not restore the lost ability of the microorganisms to decompose sulphanilic acid.
