TI  - An in Vitro Experimental Study on the Antimicrobial Activity of Silicone Oil against Anaerobic Bacteria.
AB  - Abstract Purpose: To investigate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of silicone  oil against anaerobic agents, specifically Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus spp., Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides fragilis, Fuobacterium spp., and Clostridium tertium. Method: A 0.5 McFarland turbidity of Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus spp., Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides fragilis, Fuobacterium spp., and Clostridium tertium was prepared, and 0.1 mL was inoculated into 0.9 mL of silicone oil. Control inoculations were performed in anaerobic blood agar and fluid thioglycollate medium without silicone oil. Results: Propionibacterium acnes retained their viability on the 3rd day in the presence of silicone oil. In total, 9.7 x 106 colonies were enumerated from 1 mL of silicone oil. After a prolonged incubation of 7 days, the number of colonies observed was 9.2 x 106. The other bacteria disappeared after the 3rd day of incubation in silicone oil. Conclusions: Propionibacterium acnes, which is the most common chronic postoperative endophthalmitis agent, is thought to be resistant to silicone oil.
TI  - Bacteriological evaluation of tonsillar microbial flora according to age and tonsillar size in recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  - Although numerous studies based on the bacteriology of the tonsil have been carried out, none of them analyzed the variation of tonsillar flora with respect to both age and tonsillar size. The purpose of this study was to isolate the facultative and obligate anaerobes both from the surface and the core of tonsils in recurrent tonsillitis as well as to analyze the variation of isolated bacterial strains according to age and tonsillar size. A prospective study was performed on 111 patients who underwent tonsillectomy. We analyzed the differences between the bacterial pathogens in recurrent tonsillitis and semi-growth estimates with regard to age and tonsillar grade. Among 111 cases, 604 bacterial strains of 21 different from the tonsil superficial and core were isolated. The most common facultative anaerobic species isolated from the surface and core were Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Alpha-hemolytic streptococci and Diphtheroid bacilli in all subgroups except patients below 8 years old. The most commonly obligate anaerobic species isolated from the core were Propionibacterium acnes, Prevotella melaninogenica and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. We found no significant difference in the cultured bacteria with respect to age and tonsillar size. The study subgroups did not differ in the occurrence of semiquantitative growth estimates of 3-4+. Our study demonstrates that there is polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic flora in tonsils with regardless of patient's age and tonsillar size. This polymicrobial spectrum of bacteria may contribute to recurrence and to the failure of conservative treatment of these cases and therefore leads to surgical therapy.
TI  - Analysis of distribution patterns of Propionibacterium acnes phylotypes and Peptostreptococcus species from acne lesions.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The precise roles of Propionibacterium acnes and other anaerobic bacteria in the pathogenesis of acne are still unclear. Recent studies have shown that P. acnes can be further classified into several phylotypes with distinct phenotypes and virulence. Their distribution patterns in acne lesions have rarely been demonstrated. OBJECTIVES: To analyse distribution patterns of P. acnes phylotypes and Peptostreptococcus species on the skin surface of patients with acne and healthy controls, and in comedones, papules and pustules from patients. METHODS: A total of 370 samples from 95 patients with acne and 65 samples from 65 healthy controls were investigated. Three P. acnes phylotypes and three Peptostreptococcus species were identified by polymerase chain reaction primarily using type-specific primers. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the microflora of the skin surface samples between patients with acne and healthy controls. In acne lesions, distribution patterns between skin surface and comedonal lesions were similar, but they were significantly different from those of both papules and pustules. In the inflammatory acne lesions, the proportion of type IA P. acnes was increased, while those of type IB and II were decreased. The proportion of Peptostreptococcus species was also increased significantly in the inflammatory lesions. CONCLUSIONS: At the precision of this qualitative study, our results do not provide any evidence that different phylotypes in the surface microflora might be important in triggering acne. However, type IA P. acnes and Peptostreptococcus species might be more closely associated with inflammatory acne lesions.
TI  - Detection of nine microorganisms from the initial carious root lesions using a TaqMan-based real-time PCR.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to quantify nine selected cariogenic bacteria in plaque from sound root surfaces and initial carious root lesions using TaqMan PCR and to analyse a putative dependence on the kind of initial periodontal treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-four subjects with generalized chronic periodontitis were randomly allocated to one of the following initial periodontal therapies: full-mouth disinfection, full-mouth scaling and root planing or scaling and root planing within 7 days. Plaque samples were taken before and after periodontal treatment and analysed by TaqMan PCR. RESULTS: The quantity of the cariogenic bacteria Actinomyces spp., Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacilllus spp., Rothia dentocariosa, Parvimonas micra, Propionibacterium acnes and Neisseria mucosa were significantly higher, while the quantity of Veillonella parvula was significantly lower on initial carious lesions than on the sound surfaces both before and after periodontal therapy. No significant differences could be found in any of the tested bacteria except P. micra on initial carious lesions and sound surfaces for both examinations between the groups. CONCLUSION: All the nine species analysed were found to be present in initial carious root lesions as well as sound root surfaces but in different quantities, independent of the different periodontal therapies.
TI  - Efficacy of an anaerobic swab transport system to maintain aerobic and anaerobic  microorganism viability after storage at -80 degrees C.
AB  - An Amies agar gel swab transport system was evaluated for its ability to maintain bacterial viability and relative quantity after freezing at -80 degrees C. Nine American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) bacterial strains were used: 3 anaerobic strains (Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Clostridium sporogenes) and 6 facultative or strict aerobic bacterial strains (Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Escherichia coli ([ATCC 25922 and ATCC 11775], Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Lactobacillus casei). The bacterial species were chosen because they corresponded to bacteria identified in psittacine feces and cloacal samples. There were no significant differences between growth scores at baseline and after storage at -80 degrees C for 40 days for any of the bacteria examined after 48 and 72 hr of incubation, with the exception of P. anaerobius. For P. anaerobius, there was a significant reduction (P < 0.001) in the growth score after storage at -80 degrees C for 40 days from that of the baseline; however, the bacteria were still viable. The tested swab transport system may be useful when lengthy storage and transport times necessitate freezing samples prior to culture.
TI  - Bacteriologic culture of excised intervertebral disc from immunocompetent patients undergoing single level primary lumbar microdiscectomy.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A consecutive case series from a single center of patients undergoing primary microdiscectomy for lumbar herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP) who received microbiologic laboratory culture of excised disc material. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of positive bacterial cultures in the disc material of immunocompetent patients without diabetes mellitus or other immune compromise. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The intradiscal space is a physiologically tenuous environment in terms of oxygen tension, pH, and vascularity. This space may be susceptible to indolent infections with an unknown effect on the pathogenesis of HNP. METHODS: This case series included 52 patients with radiculopathy and magnetic resonance imaging positive for HNP who elected for lumbar microdiscectomy after failure of conservative management. All patients received primary surgery at a single spinal level in the absence of diabetes mellitus, systemic steroid use, chemotherapy, other immune compromise, or prior lumbar surgery. Excised disc material was sent for routine bacterial culture. No special culture techniques were used to improve the yield of positive cultures. RESULTS: Cultures were positive in 10 patients (19.2%). Propionibacterium acnes was the sole organism isolated in 7 (13.5%), with Peptostreptococcus and Staphylococcus species accounting for the remainder. There were 24 women (46.2%) and 28 men (53.8%) with a mean age of 43.9 years (SE 1.8). Duration of symptoms was greater than 12 weeks in 35 patients (67.3%). Onset of symptoms was insidious in 22 patients (42.3%), sudden in 16 (30.8%), and the history was unclear in the remainder. Prior epidural steroid injection was received by 17 patients (32.7%), and 11 patients had a history of smoking (21.2%). None of these variables was significantly different in patients with positive and negative cultures (P >0.05). CONCLUSIONS: P. acnes was isolated by routine laboratory culture of excised disc material in 13.5% of immunocompetent patients undergoing primary single level discectomy for radiculopathy with lumbar HNP; other organisms were isolated in 6% of patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic level of evidence III.
TI  - Infective endocarditis caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - This review summarizes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of infective endocarditis (IE) due to anaerobic bacteria. Anaerobic bacteria are an uncommon but important cause of IE. Most cases are caused by the anaerobic and microaerophilic streptococci Propionibacterium acnes, Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium species. Predisposing factors and signs and symptoms of IE caused by anaerobic bacteria are similar to those seen in IE due to facultative anaerobic bacteria with the following exceptions: there is a lower incidence of pre-existing valvular heart disease, a higher incidence of thromboembolic events and a higher mortality rate with anaerobic IE. The gastrointestinal tract is the most common source for B. fragilis group IE, the head and neck are the most common origin for Fusobacterium and Bacteroides species, and the head and neck or genitourinary tract is the most common source for Peptostreptococcus species. Multiple mycotic aneurysms are a common complication with anaerobic IE. Others include valvular destruction, aortic-ring abscess, aortitis, cardiogenic shock, dysrrhythmias and septic shock. The mortality rate for patients with anaerobic IE ranges from 21 to 43%. Treatment of anaerobic IE includes the use of antimicrobial effective against these organisms. Surgical intervention may be indicated in some patients.
TI  - Value of anaerobic culture in bacterial surveillance program for platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Short-term aerobic bacterial culture (STABC) has been used routinely  in Hong Kong since 1998 to reduce bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates (PCs) with good results. With more countries implementing routine aerobic and anaerobic cultures of PCs, a prospective study was conducted to determine the value of anaerobic culture to STABC. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: PC tested by STABC was used as control. Twenty milliliters of the PC selected for this study was aliquoted and pooled for 7 days aerobic and anaerobic culture. If the initial culture was positive, samples retrieved from the original PC and their associated components were cultured for confirmation and microbiologic identification. RESULTS: A total of 10,035 PC units (2007 pools) were tested. The confirmed positive rates by aerobic and anaerobic cultures per pool were 3 (0.15%) and 13 (0.65%), respectively, which was equivalent to an increased yield from 0.03 to 0.13 percent of PC if anaerobic culture was added. Of the 10 bacteria detected by anaerobic culture only, 9 were found to be Propionibacterium acnes and the remaining one Peptostreptococcus sp. Their mean detection time from inoculation was 92.16 hours (range, 50.4-124.8 hr). CONCLUSION: Addition of anaerobic culture to our routine STABC would significantly increase the detection rate of bacterial contaminated PC. However, since only slow-growing bacteria were detected, and because their clinical significance was uncertain, it is concluded that there was no clear justification to introduce anaerobic culture locally if 5-day shelf life for PCs was to be maintained.
TI  - Infection associated with hematoma formation after shoulder arthroplasty.
AB  - Hematoma formation requiring operative treatment after shoulder arthroplasty may  be associated with higher patient morbidity. We therefore determined whether there was an association of hematoma formation requiring operative treatment with deep infection after shoulder arthroplasty. Between 1978 and 2006, we performed 4147 shoulder arthroplasties in 3643 patients. Of these, 12 shoulders (0.3%) underwent reoperation for hematoma formation. The mean time interval from arthroplasty to surgery for the hematoma was 7 days (range, 0.5-31 days). Among nine cases in which cultures were taken, six had positive cultures; the organisms included Propionibacterium acnes in three, Staphylococcus epidermidis in one, Streptococcus species in one, and Staphylococcus epidermidis with Peptostreptococcus in one. The minimum followup was 12 months (mean, 68 months; range, 12 to 294 months). Two of the 12 patients eventually underwent resection arthroplasty for deep infection. The Neer score was excellent in one, satisfactory in six, and unsatisfactory in five patients. The data suggest hematoma formation after shoulder arthroplasty is often accompanied by positive intraoperative cultures. The surgeon should be aware of the high rate of unsatisfactory results associated with this complication as well as the possibility of developing a deep infection requiring additional surgery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, prognostic study. See Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.
TI  - Microbiology and management of joint and bone infections due to anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - PURPOSE: To describes the microbiology, diagnosis, and management of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis due to anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: The predominant anaerobes in arthritis are anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli (AGNB) including the Bacteroides fragilis group, Fusobacterium spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., and Propionibacterium acnes. Infection with P. acnes is associated with a prosthetic joint, previous surgery, and trauma. B. fragilis group is associated with distant infection, Clostridium spp. with trauma, and Fusobacterium spp. with oropharyngeal infection. Most cases of anaerobic arthritis, in contrast to anaerobic osteomyelitis, involved a single isolate, and most cases are secondary to hematogenous spread. The predominant anaerobes in osteomyelitis are Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium, and Clostridium spp. as well as P. acnes. Conditions predisposing to bone infections are vascular disease, bites, contiguous infection, peripheral neuropathy, hematogenous spread, and trauma. Pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. are mostly isolated in skull and bite infections, members of the B. fragilis group in hand and feet infections, and Fusobacterium spp. in skull, bite, and hematogenous long bone infections. Many patients with osteomyelitis due to anaerobic bacteria have evidence of an anaerobic infection elsewhere in the body that is the source of the organisms involved in the osteomyelitis. Treatment of arthritis and osteomyelitis involving anaerobic bacteria includes symptomatic therapy, immobilization in some cases, adequate drainage of purulent material, and antibiotic therapy effective against these organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Anaerobic bacteria can cause septic arthritis and osteomyelitis. Correct diagnosis and appropriate therapy are important contributor to successful outcome.
TI  - [Co-occurence of indol-producing bacterial strains in the vagina of women infected with Chlamydia trachomatis].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine if cervicitis, caused by Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis), has an influence on the frequency of occurrence of selected aerobic and anaerobic bacterial strains, connected with etiology of aerobic vaginitis (AV) and bacterial vaginosis (BV). Indole-producing bacteria have received particular attention due to their possibly inductive role in chronic cervicitis caused by C. trachomatis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The swabs from vagina and cervical canal have been obtained from 122 women (aged 18-40). The presence of C. trachomatis antigen had been detected and diagnosed with the help of direct immunofluorescence, BV with Amesl and Nugent criteria, whereas the AV with Donders criteria. The identification of the bacterial strains isolated from vagina has been performed according to classical microbiological diagnostics. RESULTS: Disruption of vaginal microflora (4-10 in Nugent score) was determined in 11,5% of observed women. AV was diagnosed in 4.5% women with chlamydial cervicitis, BV was diagnosed in 10.9% and 5.45% of these women, on the basis of Amsel and Nugent criteria respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Indole-producing bacterial strains connected with BV and AV (Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Propionibacterium acnes, Escherichia coli) have been isolated significantly more often from vagina of women infected with C trachomatis (p = 0.0405, chi2 = 4.20) and these findings confirm co-importance of indole-producing bacterial strains in cervicitis caused by C trachomatis .
TI  - Breast abscess bacteriologic features in the era of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus epidemics.
AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Increasing rates of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections have also affected the microbial profile of breast abscesses. OBJECTIVE: To update the decade-old bacteriologic description of breast abscesses to improve the choice of initial antibacterial drug therapy. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: County hospital emergency department. PATIENTS: Forty-four women (mean age, 41 years; age range, 20-63 years) with breast abscesses. METHODS: All cultures from the breast abscesses of patients were reviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The microbiologic features and sensitivities of breast abscesses. RESULTS: Of 46 specimens only 28 showed bacterial yield (61%). Of these, 11 (39%) were polymicrobial, for an average of 1.4 isolates per specimen. The most common organism was S aureus, present in 12 of 37 aerobic cultures (32%), with MRSA in 7 (58%). The remaining organisms included coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (16%), diphtheroids (16%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), Proteus mirabilis (5%), and other isolates (22%). All MRSA was sensitive to clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and linezolid. Only 2 patients (29%) were sensitive to levofloxacin. Two anaerobic cultures were positive for Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. CONCLUSIONS: Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogenic organism in modern breast abscesses. Many breast abscesses have community-acquired MRSA, with more than 50% of all S aureus and 19% of all cultures being MRSA. This finding parallels the local and national increases in MRSA reported in other soft-tissue infections. With increasing bacterial resistance and more minimally invasive management of breast abscesses, understanding the current bacteriologic profile of these abscesses is essential to determining the correct empirical antibiotic drug therapy.
TI  - Microbiology of acute sinusitis of odontogenic origin presenting with periorbital cellulitis in children.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken to evaluate the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of acute maxillary sinusitis of odontogenic origin presenting with periodontal infection in children. METHODS: Aspirates of 18 acutely infected maxillary sinuses that were associated with odontogenic infection in children who presented with periorbital cellulitis were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: A total of 54 isolates were recovered (3.0 per specimen): 13 aerobic and facultative (0.7 per specimen) and 41 anaerobic (2.3 per specimen). The number of isolates per specimen varied from 1 to 4. Aerobic and facultative organisms alone were recovered in 2 specimens (11%), anaerobes only in 7 (39%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 9 (50%). The predominant aerobic and facultative organisms were alpha-hemolytic streptococci (4), microaerophilic streptococci (3), and Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus (2 each). The predominant anaerobic bacteria were anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (17), Peptostreptococcus spp (11), Fusobacterium spp (8), and Propionibacterium acnes (2). Twelve beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were recovered from 9 specimens (50%). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the unique aerobic and anaerobic microbiological features of acute maxillary sinusitis of odontogenic origin presenting with periorbital cellulitis in children.
TI  - Activities of four frog skin-derived antimicrobial peptides (temporin-1DRa, temporin-1Va and the melittin-related peptides AR-23 and RV-23) against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activities of two antimicrobial peptides belonging to the temporin family (temporin-1DRa from Rana draytonii and temporin-1Va from Rana virgatipes) and two peptides with structural similarity to the bee venom peptide melittin (AR-23 from Rana tagoi and RV-23 from R. draytonii) were evaluated against a range of reference strains and clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. These peptides were selected because they show broad-spectrum growth inhibitory activity against reference strains of several medically important aerobic microorganisms and against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. All peptides showed relatively high potency (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) </=25 microM) against the Gram-positive bacilli Propionibacterium acnes and Clostridium tertium and the Gram-positive cocci Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. Activity was lower and more variable against Clostridium septicum, Clostridium perfringens and Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. Growth of the Gram-negative bacilli Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium spp. was poorly inhibited, but all the peptides were active (MIC</=25 microM) against Prevotella melaninogenica. The clinical utility of the melittin-related peptides is limited by their toxicities, but temporin-1DRa and temporin-1Va have relatively low haemolytic activity against human erythrocytes and so represent candidates for drug development, particularly for topical therapy of infected surface lesions.
TI  - Bacteriology of chronic sinusitis and acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish the microbiological characteristics of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis (AECS). SETTING: Academic medical center. PATIENTS: Thirty-two patients with chronic sinusitis and 30 patients with AECS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of maxillary AECS and chronic maxillary sinusitis. RESULTS: A total of 81 isolates (33 aerobic and 48 anaerobic) were recovered from the 32 cases (2.5 per specimen) with chronic sinusitis. Aerobes alone were recovered in 8 specimens (25%), anaerobes only were isolated in 11 (34%), and mixed aerobes and anaerobes were recovered in 13 (41%). The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus aureus. The predominant anaerobic bacteria were Peptostreptococcus subspecies, Fusobacterium subspecies, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, and Propionibacterium acnes. Twenty-one beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were recovered from 17 specimens (53%). A total of 89 isolates (40 aerobic and facultatives, and 49 anaerobic) were recovered from the 30 patients (3.0 per specimen) with AECS. Aerobes were recovered in 8 instances (27%), anaerobes only in 11 (37%), and mixed aerobes and anaerobes were recovered in 11 (37%). The predominant aerobes were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacteriaceae, and S aureus. The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus subspecies, Fusobacterium subspecies, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, and P acnes. Thirty-six beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were recovered from 28 specimens (53%). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the organisms isolated from patients with AECS were predominantly anaerobic and were similar to those generally recovered in patients with chronic sinusitis. However, aerobic bacteria that are usually found in acute infections (eg, S pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis) can also emerge in some of the episodes of AECS.
TI  - In vitro activity of oritavancin (LY333328), vancomycin, clindamycin, and metronidazole against Clostridium perfringens, Propionibacterium acnes, and anaerobic Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Using an agar dilution method, we determined the in vitro activity of oritavancin, vancomycin, clindamycin and metronidazole against 114 unique clinical isolates of Gram-positive anaerobes. MIC(90)s (microg/mL) for oritavancin were as follows: Clostridium perfringens 1.0, Propionibacterium acnes 0.25, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius 0.25, Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus 0.5, Finegoldia magna 0.25, Micromonas. micros 0.25, and Anaerococcus prevotii 0.25. On a weight basis, oritavancin is slightly more active than vancomycin against the strains tested. The oritavancin MICs are comparable to those previously reported against staphylococci and enterococci. Oritavancin shows excellent potential for treatment of infections containing Gram-positive anaerobes such as these.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria in New Zealand: 1999-2003.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Routine susceptibility testing of all anaerobic organisms is not advocated, but it is useful for laboratories to test periodically for anaerobic organisms and provide local susceptibility data to guide therapy. This study reports the national trend of antibiotic susceptibility of clinically significant anaerobes in New Zealand. METHODS: Clinical isolates were tested using standardized methods against a range of antibiotics commonly used to treat anaerobic infections. Susceptibility was determined using NCCLS criteria. The change in susceptibility trends between this study and earlier studies was measured by comparing the geometric mean of the MIC. RESULTS: A total of 364 anaerobes were tested. Penicillin had poor activity against Bacteroides spp., Prevotella spp., Eubacterium spp., Clostridium tertium and Veillonella spp. In general, Fusobacterium spp., Bacteroides ureolyticus, Propionibacterium spp., Clostridium perfringens and anaerobic streptococci isolates, with the exception of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, were penicillin susceptible. Amoxicillin/clavulanate showed good activity against most anaerobes, but resistance was seen with Bacteroides fragilis group and P. anaerobius isolates. Cefoxitin was more active than cefotetan, particularly against non-B. fragilis species, Eubacterium spp. and P. anaerobius. Meropenem and imipenem showed good activity against all anaerobes, with only 2 and 4% of Bacteroides spp., respectively, showing resistance. With the exception of Propionibacterium acnes isolates, which are predictably resistant, metronidazole was active against all anaerobes tested. There has been little change in susceptibility since 1997. CONCLUSIONS: Metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin/tazobactam and amoxicillin/clavulanate remain good empirical choices when anaerobes are expected in our setting. No clinically relevant changes in susceptibility over time were found.
TI  - Microbiology of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We undertook to evaluate the microbiology of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis (AECS). METHODS: Repeated aspirations of maxillary sinus secretions by endoscopy were performed in 7 patients over a period of 125 to 242 days. RESULTS: Bacteria were recovered for all 22 aspirates, and the number of isolates was between 2 and 4. A total of 54 isolates were isolated: 16 aerobic and facultative bacteria and 38 anaerobic bacteria. The aerobic bacteria were Haemophilus influenzae (7 isolates), Streptococcus pneumoniae (3), Moraxella catarrhalis (3), Staphylococcus aureus (2), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1). The anaerobic bacteria included pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp (19), Peptostreptococcus spp (9), Fusobacterium spp (8), and Propionibacterium acnes (2). A change in the types of isolates was noted in all consecutive cultures obtained from the same patients as different organisms emerged and previously isolated bacteria were no longer recovered. An increase in antimicrobial resistance was noted in 6 instances. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the microbial dynamics of AECS in which anaerobic and aerobic bacteria prevail, and highlights the importance of obtaining cultures from patients with AECS for guidance in selection of proper antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Infected neonatal cephalohematomas caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present the microbiological and clinical features of six children with infected cephalohematomas (IC) caused by anaerobic bacteria. DESIGN: Presentation of a case series. RESULTS: Polymicrobial infection was present in all instances, where the number of isolates varied from two to four. Two patients had anaerobes only and the other four had mixed flora of strict anaerobes and facultatives. There were 16 bacterial isolates (12 anaerobic, 4 aerobic). The anaerobic isolates were Peptostreptococcus spp. (5 isolates), Prevotella spp. (4), Bacteroides fragilis group (2), and Propionibacterium acnes (1). The aerobic isolates were E. coli (2), Staphylococcus aureus (1) and group B streptococci (1). Blood cultures were positive for three patients. The most common predisposing conditions were vacuum extraction and amnionitis (4 instances of each), instrumental delivery (3), electronic fetal monitoring (2), prolonged delivery (1), and premature rupture of membranes (1). All patients underwent drainage, and four also had surgical incision and drainage of the IC. Osteomyelitis developed in one instance and scalp abscess developed in two patients, both of whom had electronic fetal monitoring. All patients eventually recovered from infection after receiving parenteral and subsequent oral antibiotic therapy for a total of 14-38 days. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the polymicrobial nature and potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in IC in newborns.
TI  - Anaerobic spondylodiscitis: case series and systematic review.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial spondylodiscitis is rarely caused by anaerobic organisms. We describe two patients with lumbar vertebral osteomyelitis and discitis caused by anaerobic bacteria, including an unusual occurrence after an endodontic procedure, and review the salient clinical features and outcomes of 31 previously reported cases. METHODS: Case reports and review of the literature. RESULTS: Median age at presentation was 65 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 2:1. The most common presenting symptoms were back pain, fever, and neurologic deficits. The lumbar spine was most frequently involved (43%); an equal number of cases involved contiguous extension or hematogenous spread. Causative anaerobes were recovered from disk space or vertebrae (13), blood (4), and/or soft tissue abscess and included Bacteroides species (12), Propionibacterium acnes (7), Peptococcus species (4), Peptostreptococcus species and Clostridium species (3 each), Corynebacterium diphtheroides and Fusobacterium species (2 each), and unspecified anaerobes (3). CONCLUSIONS: Apart from specific antibiotic selection, medical treatment and outcomes for anaerobic spondylodiscitis are similar to those for aerobic vertebral disk infection.
TI  - Retrospective case review of capsular contracture after two-stage breast reconstruction: is colonization of the tissue expander pocket associated with subsequent implant capsular contracture?
AB  - Periprosthetic capsular contracture is a common problem associated with implant-based breast reconstruction. The purpose of this study was to determine if bacterial colonization of the tissue expander contributes to contracture of the permanent implant. Medical records were reviewed for 86 patients (124 tissue expanders) between 1997 and 2001 in 1 institution. Three specimens taken from the expander were cultured. The overall incidence of colonization was 42.7%; 49.4% (38.8-60.0) of immediate and 28.2% (14.1-42.3) of delayed expanders had at least 1 positive culture site (P = 0.043). The most common organisms were Propionibacterium acnes (57.6%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (31.0%), and Peptostreptococcus (5.8%). Statistical analysis revealed no significant difference between colonization of the expander and capsular contracture of the permanent prosthesis (P = 0.59). 45.8% (25.9-65.8) of breasts irradiated preoperatively developed contracture versus 14% (7.2-20.8) with no irradiation (P = 0.0013). These results suggest that colonization of the expander occurs frequently, irradiation predisposes to contracture, and colonization did not contribute to secondary implant contracture in this study population.
TI  - Beta-lactamase production and antimicrobial susceptibility of subgingival bacteria from refractory periodontitis.
AB  - This study assessed the extent of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in subgingival plaque samples obtained from 25 patients with refractory marginal periodontitis in the USA. beta-Lactamase-positive isolates were characterized using commercial diagnostic kits and partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The susceptibilities to different antimicrobial agents were tested and, in addition, the isolates were screened for the presence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were detected in 18 (72%) patients. The most prominent beta-lactamase-producing organisms belonged to the anaerobic genus Prevotella. Other enzyme-producing anaerobic strains were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus sp. Facultative bacteria, such as Burkholderia spp., Ralstonia pickettii, Capnocytophaga spp., Bacillus spp., Staphylococcus spp. and Neisseria sp., were also detected among the enzyme-producers. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ampicillin and amoxicillin were in the range 1.5-256 micrograms/ml and 4-256 micrograms/ml, respectively, for the isolates of the Prevotella species. All Prevotella isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate and metronidazole, but they showed variable resistance to tetracyclines. Two of the Prevotella isolates had high MICs of cefotaxime and ceftazidime. ESBL activity was not detected in any of the beta-lactamase-producing isolates by the Etest method. Thus, our study demonstrated a wide variety of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria that may play a role in refractory periodontal disease.
TI  - Increased antimicrobial resistance in organisms recovered from otitis media with  effusion.
AB  - Previous studies concerning the microbiology of otitis media with effusion (OME)  did not correlate the past use of antimicrobial agents with the recovered organism's antimicrobial susceptibility. A retrospective analysis of cultures obtained from aspirates of 129 children with OME was performed. The study identified the isolated organisms and determined their susceptibility to the most recently administered antimicrobials. Bacterial growth was noted in 58 (45 per cent) patients. Aerobic organisms only were recovered in 37 aspirates (63 per cent of the culture-positive aspirates); anaerobic bacteria in seven (12 per cent); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 14 (24 per cent). A total of 92 bacterial isolates were recovered, accounting for 1.6 isolates per specimen (1.1 aerobes and 0.5 anaerobes). There were a total of 66 aerobic isolates, including Haemophilus influenzae non type-b (20 isolates), Streptococcus pneumoniae (17), and Staphylococcus spp. (seven). Twenty-six anaerobes were recovered, including Peptostreptococcus spp. and Prevotella spp. (eight each) and Propionibacterium acnes (four). Resistance to the antimicrobial used was found in 60 (65 per cent) isolates, recovered from 41 (71 per cent) of the patients. Of the 41 patients in whom resistance was detected, 37 (90 per cent) had been treated within three months of culture and four (10 per cent) had completed treatment more than three months before the cultures were taken (p < 0.01). The highest rate of recovery of resistant organisms was following trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (96 per cent), amoxycillin (71 per cent), and azithromycin (56 per cent). Of the patients treated with amoxycillin, H influenzae predominated. S pneumoniae was recovered from four of the seven (57 per cent) after trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, four of 14 (29 per cent) following amoxycillin, and three of 11 (27 per cent) after azithromycin. The data illustrate the relationship between resistance to the antimicrobials given to children and their recovery from the middle ear of patients with OME.
TI  - Meningitis and shunt infection caused by anaerobic bacteria in children.
AB  - This review describes the microbiology and management of meningitis and shunt infections caused by anaerobic bacteria in children. The predominant anaerobes recovered in meningitis are Bacteriodes spp., Bacteriodes fragilis, Fusobacterium spp., and Clostridium spp. Peptostreptococcus, Veillonella, Actinomyces, Propionibacterium acnes, and Eubacterium are less commonly isolated. The predisposing conditions for meningitis are acute or chronic middle-ear infection, sinusitis, pharyngitis, and pulmonary infections. In newborn and preterm infants the predisposing conditions are rupture of membranes, amnionitis, fetal distress, necrotizing enterocolitis, gastric perforation and subsequent ileus followed by bacteremia, aspiration pneumonitis and septicemia, infected ventriculoperitoneal or ventriculoatrial shunt, and complicating dermal sinus tract infections. Shunt infection with Propionibacterium spp. has been reported in children, especially in association with ventriculoauricular and ventriculoperitoneal shunts. Clostridium perfringens has been recovered from infants with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Multiple-organism meningitis was reported as a complication of ventriculoperitoneal and lumboperitoneal shunts that perforated the gastrointestinal tract. Early recognition and effective therapy are essential to recovery. Management of meningitis includes the use of antimicrobials effective against anaerobes that penetrate the blood-brain barrier. These include metronidazole, chloramphenicol, the combination of a penicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor, and carbapenems. The treatment of shunt infection includes antimicrobial therapy and removal of the shunt.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin compared to seven other oral antimicrobial agents against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from antral sinus puncture specimens from patients with sinusitis.
AB  - Using a microbroth method for aerobes and agar dilution for anaerobes, we studied the comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, three fluoroquinolones, two macrolides and two beta-lactams, against 207 aerobic and 162 anaerobic antral sinus puncture isolates. Gemifloxacin was active at < or = 0.25 ug/mL against 198/207 [96%] aerobes and 127/162 [78%] anaerobes or 325/369 [88%] of all isolates and was the most active quinolone on a weight basis against Gram-positive organisms. All Haemophilus and Moraxella species were susceptible to < or =0.06 ug/mL of gemifloxacin. Thirty-five anaerobic isolates [35/162, 22%] required > or =0.5 ug/mL of gemifloxacin for inhibition, including all Prevotella species [all except one strain of P. bivia were susceptible to < or = 2 ug/mL] and occasional strains of Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bilophila wadsworthia, Peptostreptococcus magnus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Propionibacterium acnes, and Veillonella species. All fusobacteria were susceptible to < or =0.25 ug/mL of gemifloxacin. Based on our in vitro study results, we conclude that gemifloxacin may offer a therapeutic alternative for sinus infections.
TI  - Effects of instrumentation, irrigation and dressing with calcium hydroxide on infection in pulpless teeth with periapical bone lesions.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the fate of microorganisms in root canals of teeth with infected pulps and periapical bone lesions with and without the use of calcium hydroxide medication. METHODOLOGY: Endodontic samples were cultured and microorganisms were counted and identified in 43 teeth before (sample 1) and after (sample 2) treatment during the first visit and before (sample 3) and after (sample 4) treatment during the second visit. In the first visit teeth were instrumented and half of the teeth were filled with a thick slurry of calcium hydroxide in sterile saline. The other teeth were obturated with gutta-percha and AH-2 6 sealer. After 4 weeks the teeth with calcium-hydroxide were accessed again and after microbiological sampling they were obturated with gutta-percha and AH-26 sealer. RESULTS: The mean total colony forming unit (CFU) counts of positive samples dropped significantly as a result of canal preparation during the first visit from 1.0 x 10(6) to 1.8 x 10(3) (between samples 1 and 2) but increased to 9.3 x 10(3) in the period between the two visits (sample 2 and 3). There was no difference in mean total CFU counts of positive samples between the end of the first (sample 2) and the end of the second visit (sample 4). The most frequently isolated species were Prevotella intermedia, Capnocytophaga spp.. Actinomyces odontolyticus. Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus micros. CONCLUSIONS: Although a calcium hydroxide paste was placed in the prepared canals, the number of positive canals had increased in the period between visits. However, the number of microorganisms had only increased to 0.93% of the original number of CFU (sample 1). It is concluded that a calcium hydroxide and sterile saline slurry limits but does not totally prevent regrowth of endodontic bacteria.
TI  - The microbiology of mucopyocele.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of mucopyocele. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of clinical and microbiologic records of patients with mucopyocele between June 1982 and September 1997. METHODS: Aspirates of 36 mucopyocele were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: One hundred six bacterial isolates, 42 aerobic and facultatives and 64 anaerobic, were recovered. The predominant aerobic isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (6 isolates), alpha-hemolytic streptococci (6), Hemophilus spp. (5), and Gram-negative bacilli (6). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp. (22), Prevotella sp. (15), Fusobacterium sp. (5), and Propionibacterium acnes(5). Thirty-three beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 23 patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings illustrate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of mucopyocele.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of electron beam-sterilized Gutta-Percha cones.
AB  - The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of electron beam sterilization on gutta-percha cones (GPCs) at different times after sterilization. An agar diffusion test was used with -one aerobic bacterium (Bacillus subtilis) and five oral anaerobic bacteria (Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Propionibacterium acnes, and Veillonella parvula). With each microorganism 30 agar plates were prepared, evenly distributed among three groups (group 1: unsterilized GPCs; groups 2 and 3: GPCs sterilized by electron beam irradiation 5 months and 5 yr before, respectively). One GPC of the selected group was placed in each plate. After incubation the area of inhibition was read on the agar plates. Inhibition of growth was significantly different for the tested microorganisms. However no significant difference was observed between the sterilized and unsterilized GPCs. Both the tested sterilized and unsterilized GPCs impair the growth of endodontic pathogens, with no influence of the time elapsed since sterilization.
TI  - Correlation between microbiology and previous sinus surgery in patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis.
AB  - Aspirates of 108 chronically inflamed maxillary sinuses were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. There were 295 bacterial isolates: 109 aerobic and facultative, and 186 anaerobic. The predominant aerobic isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (17 isolates), alpha-hemolytic streptococci (14), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12), Moraxella catarrhalis (10), and Haemophilus spp (8). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp (61), Prevotella spp (45), Fusobacterium spp (15), and Propionibacterium acnes (14). Analysis of the medical histories revealed a correlation only between the microbial results and previous sinus surgery. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and gram-negative aerobic bacilli (GNAB) were more often isolated in patients who had surgery (9 of 33 patients had P aeruginosa and 17 had GNAB) than in patients who did not have surgery (3 of 75 had P aeruginosa and 7 had GNAB; p < .001). Anaerobes were isolated more often in patients who did not have surgery (69 of 75 patients) than in those who had previous surgery (21 of 33 patients; p < .001). These findings illustrate the unique microbiological features of chronic maxillary sinusitis that persist after sinus surgery.
TI  - The effects of amoxicillin therapy on skin flora in infants.
AB  - In order to determine the effect of amoxicillin therapy on the perineal skin microbial flora in infants, we took quantitative bacterial and fungal cultures of perineal and sternal areas from 25 infants treated with amoxicillin (40 mg/kg/day) for 10 days. Specimens were obtained prior to therapy, within 3 days of conclusion of therapy, and 14-16 days later. Immediately following therapy, a decline in the number of bacterial isolates occurred on both the perineum (89 to 47) and sternum (84 to 39). The greatest decline occurred in the number of anaerobic bacteria (mostly Peptostreptococcus spp. and Propionibacterium acnes). Other organisms that were less often isolated were aerobic streptococci and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The number of Candida albicans isolates increased from 3 to 11 (p < 0.05) on the perineum, and 1 to 7 (p < 0.025) on the sternum. Four of the infants developed diaper dermatitis. The density of C. albicans increased more than 14-fold following amoxicillin therapy. Cultures done 14-16 days after cessation of therapy revealed an increase in the number of bacterial isolates on the perineum (47 to 72) and on the sternum (39 to 61) and a decline in recovery of C. albicans. This study demonstrates the effects of amoxicillin on the ecology of skin microbial flora in infants-a decrease in the number of bacterial isolates and an increase in recovery of C. albicans.
TI  - In vitro activity of an evernimicin derivative, SCH27899, against anaerobic bacteria and Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - The in vitro activity of SCH27899, a novel oligosaccharide antimicrobial agent, was compared with those of representatives of six classes of antimicrobial agents (piperacillin, clarithromycin, clindamycin, vancomycin, sitafloxacin and metronidazole) against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria and Propionibacterium acnes. Against Peptostreptococcus: spp. and Clostridium difficile, SCH27899 was the most potent (MIC(90) < 0.125 mg/L) of the agents examined. Besides these Gram-positive anaerobes, SCH27899 showed a moderate level of activity against Prevotella bivia, Prevotella intermedia and Porphyromonas: spp. (MIC(90)< or = 4 mg/L).
TI  - [In vitro activities of levofloxacin and other antibiotics against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - In this study, the in vitro activity of levofloxacin (LVFX) against 1,020 fresh bacterial clinical isolates was compared with the activities of a range of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin (CPFX), ampicillin (ABPC), cefaclor, cefpodoxime, methicillin and benzylpenicillin. The clinical isolates except Vibrio cholerae were collected in Japan during 1998 from patients with infectious diseases. MICs were determined using the agar dilution method according to the recommendations by the Japan Society of Chemotherapy. Some isolates of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and coagulase negative Staphylococcus were resistant to fluoroquinolones, but the MIC50 of LVFX against MRSA was 6.25 micrograms/ml. LVFX was the most active against MRSA among the antibiotics tested. Most of Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were susceptible to the fluoroquinolones. LVFX showed greater activity against all streptococci strains compared with fluoroquinolones tested. In particular, all Streptococcus pneumoniae strains including PRSP were susceptible to LVFX at < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml. Among Enterococcus, ABPC showed superior activity against Enterococcus faecalis but many isolates of Enterococcus species were resistant to ABPC. LVFX was more active against to these Enterococcus species compared with other fluoroquinolones. On the other hand, LVFX and CPFX showed similar activity against isolates of Enterobacteriaceae. CPFX had an MIC50/90 of 0.20, 0.39 microgram/ml and LVFX showed an MIC50/90 of 0.78, 1.56 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. LVFX (MIC50/90 0.10, 0.20 microgram/ml) was more active against Acinetobacter species than CPFX (MIC50/90 0.10, 0.39 microgram/ml). Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella (Moraxella) catarrhalis and V. cholerae were inhibited by low concentration of the fluoroquinolones tested. The MIC90 of LVFX and CPFX were < or = 0.10 microgram/ml against above three species. Some isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Campylobacter species were moderately resistant to the fluoroquinolones tested but the MIC50 of LVFX and CPFX were < or = 0.39 microgram/ml. Among anaerobes, Propionibacterium acnes was more susceptible than Peptostreptococcus species, and the MIC90 of beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones tested were < or = 0.78 microgram/ml. In conclusion, this study, performed on large number of strains, confirmed an excellent and wide spectrum antibacterial activity of LVFX compared with the fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams tested. And our results suggest that LVFX may be useful in the treatment of various bacterial infections.
TI  - Dexamethasone differentially regulates cytokine transcription and translation in  macrophages responding to bacteria or okadaic acid.
AB  - Many microorganisms and microbial products induce expression of pro-inflammatory  cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1alpha/beta) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in macrophages, primarily by transcriptional activation. We show here, by using mouse macrophages in primary culture, that pre-treatment with dexamethasone inhibits bacteria-induced IL-1beta expression as mRNA and cellular pro-IL-1beta in parallel, consistent with an effect primarily on transcriptional activation. In contrast, the expression of TNF-alpha mRNA was only partly inhibited despite virtually complete inhibition of TNF-alpha protein formation. Furthermore, the selective induction of primarily cell-associated 26,000 M, pro-TNF-alpha by the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid also was partly inhibited at the mRNA level by dexamethasone, whereas additional translational inhibition appeared to be lacking. This latter finding is reminiscent of earlier findings regarding signalling to activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2, which is sensitive to dexamethasone when elicited by bacteria, but not when elicited by okadaic acid. The present results raise the possibility that the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on TNF-alpha translation, but not on transcriptional activation, is mediated by one or more okadaic acid-sensitive protein phosphatases.
TI  - beta-Hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms in apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis.
AB  - Thirteen teeth with necrotic pulps and apical periodontitis and nine severe periodontal pockets were cultured for presence of beta-hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms. Samples were dispersed and plated on two non-selective and one selective growth media and incubated anaerobically and in 10% CO2 in air. A total of 59 beta-hemolytic colonies were purified and identified. Eight beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates were obtained from three of the severe marginal periodontitis sites. All were identified as belonging to the Streptococcus sanguis group. No beta-hemolytic streptococci were detected in apical periodontitis samples. Twenty obligately anaerobic isolates were detected, all of which were known periodontal and endodontic pathogens. Isolates from apical periodontitis sites were identified as Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actionomyces odontolyticus and Peptostreptococcus micros, while severe marginal periodontal sites contained the same species with the addition of Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces meyeri. Of 19 staphylococci and micrococci, Staphylococcus epidermidis was the predominant isolate in both apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis sites. However, less commonly known organisms such as Staphylococcus cohnii and Micrococcus sp. were identified in severe marginal periodontitis sites. The isolation of Bacillus sp. (12 isolates) in one severe marginal periodontitis and two apical periodontitis subjects was especially interesting, warranting consideration of this organism as a legitimate isolate and potential pathogen in oral disease.
TI  - Microbiology of infected pustular psoriasis lesions.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial infections can occur in lesions of pustular psoriasis (PP). The objective of this study was to establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of secondarily infected PP. METHODS: A retrospective 10-year review was carried out of clinical and microbiology laboratory records from patients with secondarily infected PP lesions, whose specimens of infected sites were processed for the presence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: Bacterial growth was noted in 23 specimens. Aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria only were present in 12 patients (52%), anaerobic bacteria only in four (17%), and mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in seven (30%). Thirty-six isolates were recovered (1.6 per specimen), 23 aerobic or facultative bacteria and 13 strict anaerobes. The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (15 isolates), Group D Enterococcus (two isolates), and Escherichia coli (two isolates). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (six isolates) and Bacteroides fragilis group, Propionibacterium acnes, and pigmented Prevotella spp. in two each. Single bacterial isolates were recovered in 14 patients (61%), 11 of which were S. aureus. Nineteen of the organisms isolated from 18 patients (78%) produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. S. aureus was isolated from all body sites. Organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to the lesions predominated in these infections. Enteric Gram-negative rods and Bacteroides fragilis group predominated in lesions on the legs and buttocks. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, pigmented Prevotella, and Fusobacterium spp. were most frequently recovered in lesions of the hand. CONCLUSIONS: The polymicrobial etiology of secondarily infected PP lesions and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomic site of the lesions were demonstrated.
TI  - Activity of telithromycin (HMR 3647) against anaerobic bacteria compared to those of eight other agents by time-kill methodology.
AB  - Time-kill studies examined the activities of telithromycin (HMR 3647), erythromycin A, azithromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, clindamycin, pristinamycin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and metronidazole against 11 gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. Time-kill studies were carried out with the addition of Oxyrase in order to prevent the introduction of CO(2). Macrolide-azalide-ketolide MICs were 0.004 to 32.0 microg/ml. Of the latter group, telithromycin had the lowest MICs, especially against non-Bacteroides fragilis group strains, followed by azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin A, and roxithromycin. Clindamycin was active (MIC </= 2.0 microg/ml) against all anaerobes except Peptostreptococcus magnus and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, while pristinamycin MICs were 0.06 to 4.0 microg/ml. Amoxicillin-clavulanate had MICs of </=1.0 microg/ml, while metronidazole was active (MICs, 0.03 to 2.0 microg/ml) against all except Propionibacterium acnes. After 48 h at twice the MIC, telithromycin was bactericidal (>/=99.9% killing) against 6 strains, with 99% killing of 9 strains and 90% killing of 10 strains. After 24 h at twice the MIC, 90, 99, and 99.9% killing of nine, six, and three strains, respectively, occurred. Lower rates of killing were seen at earlier times. Similar kill kinetics relative to the MIC were seen with other macrolides. After 48 h at the MIC, clindamycin was bactericidal against 8 strains, with 99 and 90% killing of 9 and 10 strains, respectively. After 24 h, 90% killing of 10 strains occurred at the MIC. The kinetics of clindamycin were similar to those of pristinamycin. After 48 h at the MIC, amoxicillin-clavulanate showed 99.9% killing of seven strains, with 99% killing of eight strains and 90% killing of nine strains. At four times the MIC, metronidazole was bactericidal against 8 of 10 strains tested after 48 h and against all 10 strains after 24 h; after 12 h, 99% killing of all 10 strains occurred.
TI  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci are the most common bacteria found in cultures from the deep portions of hidradenitis suppurativa lesions, as obtained by carbon dioxide laser surgery.
AB  - The significance of bacterial findings in hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is controversial. Interpretation of the results of bacteriological examinations from the surface of HS lesions is obscured by the possible contamination of resident skin bacteria. Bacteriological analysis of aspirates from deeper parts of HS is liable to show low sensitivity. We used a carbon dioxide (CO2) laser method to evaporate the diseased tissue level by level from the surface downwards, allowing concurrent sampling of bacteriological cultures from each level and thereby minimizing contamination with bacteria from the level above. In this study, 22 women and three men with a mean age of 35.3 years and a mean HS duration of 10.6 years were treated with this CO2 laser surgical method. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures from superficial and deep levels were taken during surgery. The regions treated were axillary in eight and perineal in 17 cases. Bacterial cultures were positive for one or more specimens from at least one level in all cases and from deep levels in all but three cases. Sixteen different species or sub-species were found. Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were the species most frequently found. Peptostreptococcus species and Propionibacterium acnes were not uncommon. S. aureus was detected in a total of 14 cases, six of which were from the deep levels. S. aureus was the sole bacterium isolated in two deep cultures. CNS were found in 21 patients and 16 of these isolates were from the deep levels. In nine of the 16 deep samples CNS were the only bacteria detected. These findings motivate a re-evaluation of the significance of bacteria in the progress of HS and in particular they suggest that CNS are true pathogens. It is known that foreign bodies aggravate the virulence of the CNS in surgical implants, and an environment which resembles that produced by a foreign body, as found in chronic HS tissue, serves to intensify the pathogenic properties of CNS in HS.
TI  - Superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis in children, caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to present the microbiology and clinical features of six children with superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis (SST) caused by anaerobic bacteria. METHODS: A retrospective review of microbiological and clinical data was undertaken. RESULTS: Anaerobic bacteria alone were recovered in four instances, and they were mixed with facultative bacteria in two. There were 12 bacterial isolates (10 anaerobic and 2 facultatives). The bacteria were Peptostreptococcus species (four isolates), Prevotella species (three), and one isolate each of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. SST at an intravenous infusion site developed in all but one patient. One patient sustained trauma to the leg, and cellulitis developed. Anaerobes of oral origin (Prevotella and Fusobacterium species) were recovered in scalp vein SST, and of gastrointestinal origin (Bacteroides fragilis) in a lower extremity SST. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in children with SST.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of BAY 12-8039 and five other antimicrobial agents  against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of BAY 12-8039 against 360 anaerobic clinical isolates was  determined by the agar dilution method and compared to that of five other antimicrobial agents. BAY 12-8039 and imipenem were the most active agents tested. The following MIC90 values were determined for BAY 12-8039: Peptostreptococcus spp. (50 isolates), 1 mg/l; Propionibacterium acnes (30 isolates). 0.25 mg/l; Clostridium perfringens (30 isolates), 0.5 mg/l; Clostridium difficile (50 isolates), 2 mg/l; Bacteroides fragilis (50 isolates), 1 mg/l; non-fragilis Bacteroides, Porphyromonas, and Prevotella spp. (100 isolates), 2 mg/l; and Fusobacterium spp. (50 isolates), 0.25 mg/l. The results of the present study show that BAY 12-8039 may be useful in the treatment and prophylaxis of anaerobic infections.
TI  - Microbiology of cervical lymphadenitis in adults.
AB  - The microbiology of needle aspirates from 40 inflamed cervical lymph glands was studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, fungi and mycobacteria. Forty-two bacterial, 11 mycobacterial and six fungal isolates were isolated. Aerobic bacteria only were recovered in 11 (27.5%), anaerobes alone in five (12.5%) and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in seven (17.5%). Mycobacterium sp. were recovered in 11 (27.5%) and fungi in six (15%). The recovery of anaerobes was associated with dental infection. Eighteen aerobic bacteria were isolated and the predominant ones were Staphylococcus aureus (eight isolates) and group A streptococci (four). Twenty-four anaerobic bacteria were recovered and the predominant ones were: Prevotella sp. (six), Peptostreptococcus sp. (five), Propionibacterium acnes (four) and Fusobacterium sp. (three). These findings demonstrate the role of anaerobic organisms in cervical lymphadenitis and the need to culture aspirated material from the glands for both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of chronic venous ulcers.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of chronic venous leg ulcers (CVLU) is unclear. The objective of the study was to establish the aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of CVLU. METHODS: A retrospective review was carried out of the clinical and microbiological laboratory records obtained from patients with CVLU. Microorganisms were grown from 43 specimens obtained from 41 patients. RESULTS: Aerobic or facultative bacteria alone were present in 18 (42%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria only in three (7%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 22 (51%). In total, there were 97 isolates, 64 aerobic or facultative and 33 anaerobic, an average of 2.3 isolates per specimen (1.5 aerobes and 0.8 anaerobes). The predominant aerobic organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (26 isolates), group D streptococci (5), and Escherichia coli(5). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (15), Bacteroides fragilis group (6), Propionibacterium acnes (4), and Prevotella spp. (3). CONCLUSIONS: CVLU have a polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora.
TI  - [Meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  - Meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position C1 which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (DHP-1), thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. Its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in C2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. Meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the PBPs. It covers gram positive aerobes (Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, Enterococcus faecalis, Rhodococcus equi, Listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, Vibrio, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria, Moraxella) and anaerobes (Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, and Propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: P. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and H. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci, streptococci and staphylococci). Meropenem has no activity on Enterococcus faecium, S. aureus resistant to methycillin, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). Resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the OprD porin (OprD2 in enterobacteria and P. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the PBPs (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).
TI  - Ribotyping of bacteria from root canal and blood of patients receiving endodontic therapy.
AB  - DNA restriction patterns and corresponding ribotypes of 26 bacterial isolates (Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus intermedius, and Streptococcus sanguis) recovered from patients with infected root canals and their peripheral blood, collected during and after endodontic therapy, were examined. Eleven additional reference strains including type strains were also examined. Purified DNA was digested with BglI,EcoRI, and HindIII. Hybridization was carried out with a digoxigenin-labeled cDNA probe obtained by reverse transcription of Escherichia coli 16S + 23S rRNA. Ribotypes of the bacteria recovered from root canal and blood showed identical characteristics within the patients, and differed between the patients. The results were confirmed when the similarity coefficient (S(AB)) of the ribotypes from the isolates were assessed by the Dendron computer-assisted system. These results suggested that the bacteria isolated from the blood originated from the root canal.
TI  - Electrophoresis of whole-cell soluble proteins of microorganisms isolated from bacteremias in endodontic therapy.
AB  - We have previously demonstrated that anaerobic bacteria are the microorganisms most frequently isolated from blood following endodontic therapy of teeth with apical periodontitis. Phenotypic characterisation of the isolates suggested that the bacteria in the blood originated from the root canal. The present experiment using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was carried out in an effort to verify these findings, and to further study the microorganisms involved in endodontic bacteremias. Soluble cellular proteins were extracted from 11 reference strains and 26 bacterial isolates recovered from the root canal and blood. These included Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia. Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus sanguis. The electrophoretic patterns mostly confirmed the identity of the isolates as determined by the biochemical and antimicrobial resistance tests. Furthermore, with this typing method the species Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens could be differentiated. These species had been recovered from both root canal and blood. Also, differences between subspecies of Fusobacterium nucleatum became evident with SDS-PAGE, and the results indicated that the organism recovered from the root canal and blood was Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincentii. The electrophoretic patterns of the different organisms isolated from the root canal and the blood were similar, providing further evidence that the bacteria found in the blood originated from the root canal.
TI  - Microbiology of acute purulent pericarditis. A 12-year experience in a military hospital.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the aerobic and anaerobic micro-biological and clinical characteristics in 15 cases of acute pericarditis treated over a 12-year period. DESIGN: Retrospective review of microbiological and clinical data. SETTING: Military hospital in Bethesda, Md. RESULTS: Aerobic or facultative bacteria alone were present in 7 specimens (47%), anaerobic bacteria alone in 6 specimens (40%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 2 specimens (13%). In total, there were 21 isolates: 10 aerobic or facultative bacteria and 11 anaerobic bacteria, an average of 1.4 per specimen. Anaerobic bacteria predominated in patients with pericarditis who also had mediastinitis that followed esophageal perforation and in patients whose pericarditis was associated with orofacial and dental infections. The predominant aerobic bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (3 isolates) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (2 isolates), and the predominant anaerobic bacteria were Prevotella species (4 isolates), Peptostreptococcus species (3 isolates), and Propionibacterium acnes (2 isolates). CONCLUSION: The findings in our study highlight the potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in acute pericarditis.
TI  - Infection of a total knee joint prosthesis by peptostreptococcus micros and propionibacterium acnes in an elderly RA patient: implant salvage with longterm antibiotics and needle aspiration/irrigation.
AB  - We describe the favourable long-term outcome after late total knee joint prosthesis infection in an elderly RA patient. Peptostreptococcus micros and Propionibacterium acnes were cultured from the synovial fluid, and the finding of a coexistent abscess at the root of a wisdom tooth suggested a dental origin to the joint infection. Long-term antibiotics in conjunction with aspiration/irrigation resulted in salvage of the implant and an excellent functional outcome.
TI  - Degradation of host protease inhibitors and activation of plasminogen by proteolytic enzymes from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola.
AB  - Bacterial proteases may participate in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases through their action on host proteins. In the present study, the ability of selected periodontopathogens, as well as two proteases isolated from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola, to degrade host protease inhibitors was evaluated. The activation of human plasminogen by the two bacterial proteases was also investigated. Proteolytic breakdown of host protease inhibitors (alpha-1-antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, antithrombin III, antiplasmin and cystatin C) was evaluated by SDS-PAGE. The 80 kDa trypsin-like protease of P. gingivalis completely digested the six protease inhibitors under investigation, whereas the 95 kDa chymotrypsin-like protease of T. denticola was slightly less active, more particularly on alpha 2-macroglobulin and cystatin C. When whole cells from a number of oral bacterial species were tested, the most significant degradation was obtained with P. gingivalis, T. denticola, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Capnocytophaga spp. Peptostreptococcus micros and Propionibacterium acnes had only some degradative activity on selected inhibitors, whereas three bacterial species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus and Fusobacterium nucleatum, had no effect on the protease inhibitors. The 80 kDa protease of P. gingivalis demonstrated strong plasminogen activation, whereas no such activity was associated with the 95 kDa protease of T. denticola. This study indicates the high potential of some periodontal pathogens to destroy protease inhibitors and activate plasminogen. This may result in an uncontrolled degradation of periodontal tissues and a rapid progression of the disease.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiologic characteristics of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis. DESIGN: Retrospective review of microbiologic and clinical data. SETTING: Navy Hospital in Bethesda, Md. RESULTS: Sixty-one isolates, 36 aerobic and 25 anaerobic, were isolated from samples obtained from 42 patients. Aerobic bacteria only were found in 26 (62%) patients; anaerobic only, in 11 (26%); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, in five (12%). The predominant aerobic bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 9), Escherichia coli (n = 7), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), and Klebsiella sp (n = 3). The most frequently recovered anaerobic bacteria were Peptostreptococcus sp (n = 8), Propionibacterium acnes (n = 6), Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 5), Prevotella intermedia (n = 3), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 3). Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus sp were associated with cannula-related superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis; B fragilis and Enterobacteriaceae, with abdominal surgery or pathology; and S aureus and P aeruginosa and Citrobacter sp, with burns. CONCLUSION: These data illustrate the importance of anaerobic bacteria in superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.
TI  - The aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of pustular acne lesions.
AB  - Specimens from 32 pustular acne lesions that were inoculated on media supportive  for the growth of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria showed bacterial growth. Only aerobic or facultative bacteria were recovered in 15 (47%) specimens, only anaerobic bacteria in 11 (34%) specimens, and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 6 (18%) specimens. A total of 57 isolates, 31 anaerobes (1.0 per specimen) and 26 aerobes (0.8 per specimen) were recovered. The predominant isolates were Staphylococcus sp. (19 isolates), Peptostreptococcus sp. (15), and Propionibacterium sp. (10). Twelve (37.5%) of the comedones yielded only one organism. This retrospective study highlighted the polymicrobial nature of over two-thirds of culture positive pustular acne lesions and suggests the potential for pathogenic role of aerobic and anaerobic organisms other than P. acnes and Staphylococcus sp. in acne vulgaris.
TI  - Endoscopic treatment of acute frontal sinusitis: indications and limitations.
AB  
TI  - Bacteremia in conjunction with endodontic therapy.
AB  - This study characterizes oral microorganisms believed to have spread from the root canal into the blood stream during and after endodontic therapy of teeth with Asymptomatic apical periodontitis. Microbiological samples were taken under aseptic conditions from the root canal of 26 single-rooted teeth in 26 patients. In the endodontic treatment of 13 of the patients (Group 1), the first 3 reamers, sizes 15, 20 and 25, were used to a level 2 mm beyond the apical foramen. In the other 13 patients (Group 2), the instrumentation ended inside the root canal 1 mm short of the apical foramen. Blood samples were taken from the patients during the instrumentation and 10 min after the treatment was completed. Anaerobic microorganisms were isolated from all root canals. In 7 patients of Group 1, Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were recovered from the blood. In 4 patients of Group 2, P. intermedia, Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus intermedius and Streptococcus sanguis were isolated from the blood. Biochemical tests and antibiograms revealed that the isolates from the root canal and blood had identical profiles within the patients, strongly suggesting that the microorganisms isolated from the blood had the root canal as their source.
TI  - Adherence of bacteria to intraocular lenses: a prospective study.
AB  - AIMS: The study was designed to investigate the bacterial flora of the operating  field during routine cataract surgery and the source of intraocular lens contamination during the surgery. METHODS: The normal flora of the external eye and fornices of 17 patients undergoing selective cataract surgery was determined preoperatively. Swabs taken from the eyelid surface and lashes showed coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) in 90%, Propionibacterium acnes in 62%, Corynebacterium sp in 18%, and Peptostreptococcus in 3% of the patients. The lower fornices of 70% had CNS, 47% P acnes, 6% Staphylococcus aureus, 6% Corynebacterium sp, and 6% Candida. RESULTS: A sterile PMMA intraocular lens was touched on the upper bulbar conjunctiva immediately before the surgery. Eighty two per cent of lenses grew CNS, 18% P acnes, 18% Bacillus sp, 12% S aureus, and 6% Corynebacterium sp. A second sterile PMMA intraocular lens was left on the drape and near the eye during surgery. Forty seven per cent of these cultured CNS, 12% Corynebacterium sp, and 6% Bacillus sp. A high count of bacteria in the operating field, especially CNS and P acnes can contribute to postoperative inflammation and endophthalmitis. CONCLUSION: Special measures are needed before and during the surgery to reduce the chance of intraocular inoculation of these bacteria. Use of proper culture media and techniques are necessary to identify these organisms, especially anaerobes, in postoperative inflammation.
TI  - [Bone and joint infections due to unusual pathogens].
AB  - Between 1989 and 1993, 7 patients--2 men and 5 women from 19 to 70 years of age--with osteomyelitis due to an unusual organism were observed. 3 cases with Salmonella typhimurium and one at a time with Escherichia coli, Peptostreptococcus, Propionibacterium acnes and Pasteurella multocida. 5 patients were treated operative accompanied with antibiotics and 1 without operation. 1 patient declined the indicated surgical therapy. The outcome were total healing in 3 cases, healing with ankylosis of the concerning joints in 2 cases and healing with defect in 1 case.
TI  - Evaluation of minocycline and cefuzonam for antimicrobial activity against clinical isolates.
AB  - The Antibacterial activity of minocycline (MINO) and that of cefuzonam (CZON) were assessed with clinical isolates of 19 species, and compared with that of other antibiotics. MINO was highly active against methicilli-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Flavobacterium meningosepticum, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Propionibacterium acnes, but not as effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. CZON was highly active against MSSA, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, N. Gonorrhoeae, M(B). catarrhalis, H. influenzae, H. pylori, P. mirabilis, Peptostreptococcus spp. and P. acnes, but not effective against MRSA. It was minimally active against Gram-negative rods (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, etc.) and bacteria that do not ferment glucose.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of cefuroxime against recent clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of cefuroxime axetil (CXM-AX) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains obtained mainly from outpatients of our center in a period from January to September of 1990 and 1993. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined and the following results were obtained. 1. The results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, MIC80 of CXM were equal to or lower against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Peptostreptococcus spp., and Propionibacterium acnes, except for Streptococcus pneumoniae, MIC80 which was slightly higher. 2. MIC90 of comparator drugs reflected those of new resistant organisms recently appeared, such as benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP), cephem-resistant E. coli and Klebsiella spp., new quinolone-resistant H. influenzae and N. gonorrhoeae. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was detected also from specimens of community acquired infections. From the nature of MRSA detected in those situations MRSA appeared to present a continuing problem. 3. MIC90 against strains obtained from patients with community acquired infections was a good index of increases of multidrug-resistant organisms in the past. Therefore, the determination of MIC90 is important in examining changes with time of sensitivities or resistances of clinically isolated strains to antimicrobial drugs. 4. Antimicrobial activities of CXM against recent clinical isolates showed the existence of problems as mentioned above. However, MIC of CXM as well as those of comparator drugs indicated that antimicrobial activities of CXM against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., H. influenzae appeared to be relatively strong, and it is concluded that cefuroxime axetil still is one of the clinically useful oral antimicrobial drugs in the 1990's.
TI  - A quantitative comparison of selected bacteria in human carious dentine by microscopic counts.
AB  - The levels of selected cariogenic and obligately anaerobic bacteria have been compared in carious dentine taken from fissures, smooth surfaces, and root surfaces. The numbers of infected dentinal tubules were determined by immunohistological staining using species-specific antisera against selected bacteria. Selective localization was observed; mutans streptococci were the predominant bacteria in dentine from fissures and smooth surface coronal caries, but not from root surface caries. The proportion of mutans streptococci was higher in the shallow and middle layers of dentine from fissures and smooth surface coronal carious lesions than from the deep layers. In root surface caries, Actinomyces spp. were the predominant bacteria, and were present at higher levels in the deep layer of root lesions than in the shallow and middle layers. The proportion of Lactobacillus spp. was relatively low despite its high detection frequency in all layers of the three types of carious lesion. Immunohistological staining with species-specific antisera was able to reveal the distribution and the localization of various bacteria in carious dentine.
TI  - Enumeration of subgingival species on primary isolation plates using colony lifts.
AB  - This study evaluated the feasibility of using a colony lift method and DNA probes to enumerate bacterial species cultured on primary isolation plates. Fourteen digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal DNA probes representing 12 subgingival species were validated by hybridization with colony lifts prepared from 249 reference strains of 51 species grown on Trypticase soy agar plates supplemented with 5% sheep blood. Colonies of reference strains were lifted onto Nytran filters from plates and treated to lyse cells, remove cellular proteins, denature and fix microbial DNA to the filters. Positive reactions were detected with an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and revealed by bromo-chloro-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium. Cross-reactions were not observed for 13/14 probes, but 2 strains of Streptococcus mitis reacted with the probe to Streptococcus sanguis II. Subgingival plaque samples were taken by means of a sterile curette from mesiobuccal surfaces of teeth present in each of 26 subjects with differing periodontal disease states. Samples were dispersed, diluted, plated and incubated anaerobically for 7 d at 35 degrees C. Colonies were lifted as described above. Filters were cut into sections and hybridized with the 14 digoxigenin-labeled DNA probes. The probes were used to enumerate the test species and the total number of isolates was determined in 711 plaque samples. The colony lift method and DNA probes provided a sensitive, economical and quantitative method for enumerating cultivable microbial species in subgingival plaque samples. In addition, the amplification provided by growing the organisms on agar plates facilitated determination of numbers of organisms in small plaque samples, such as those from healthy sites.
TI  - Protein-kinase-C-independent activation of arachidonate release and prostaglandin E2 formation in macrophages interacting with certain bacteria.
AB  - Certain bacterial species, of which we selected Fusobacterium nucleatum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Propionibacterium acnes, were found to induce release of arachidonic acid in a dose- and time-dependent manner in mouse macrophages. The release of arachidonic acid showed a characteristic lag period of approximately 10 min and was accompanied by selective transformation into prostaglandin E2. Bacteria killed by various methods caused a similar response, indicating that bacterial surface structures rather than secreted products were involved. Down-regulation of protein kinase C by treatment of macrophages with 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate hardly affected the response to bacteria at all, except for a partial inhibition in the case of P. acnes. Furthermore, the generation of prostaglandin E2 was synergistically enhanced when macrophages were exposed to both bacteria and phorbol ester. It is also unlikely that bacterial activation was mediated exclusively via a rise in cytosolic [Ca2+], since bacteria stimulated the release of arachidonic acid also when [Ca2+] was clamped at various levels and since the response to bacteria was enhanced in an additive to synergistic manner when combined with calcium ionophore. Changes in protein phosphorylation in macrophages exposed to F. nucleatum (Gram-negative) were virtually identical to those seen with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, while P. anaerobius (Gram-positive) induced enhanced labeling of a single detectable phosphoprotein. In both cases, the changes in protein phosphorylation showed a time lag of 4-8 min and occurred independently of protein kinase C, consistent with a possible role in signal transduction. These results demonstrate that certain bacteria cause activation of arachidonic acid release and prostaglandin E2 formation in mouse macrophages; that the response is independent of protein kinase C and that it is not wholly mediated via a rise in cytosolic [Ca2+].
TI  - The importance of positive bacterial cultures of specimens obtained during clean  orthopaedic operations.
AB  - Microbiological cultures of specimens of tissue and of fluids from the wound in forty patients who had had consecutive clean, elective orthopaedic operations (excluding total joint replacements) and had not received antibiotics preoperatively were analyzed. Of the forty patients, twenty-three (58 per cent) had a positive culture on at least one of the media that were used and seventeen (43 per cent) had negative cultures. Of the forty specimens that were obtained from swabbing of the wound, eight (20 per cent) were positive on culture, compared with twenty (50 per cent) that were obtained from biopsy of tissue. Of these twenty-eight positive cultures, thirteen (46 per cent) were on routine blood-agar plates and fifteen (54 per cent), in broth only. Of the thirty-three bacterial organisms that were identified in the twenty-eight positive cultures of the wound, nineteen (58 per cent) were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus; eight (24 per cent), Propionibacterium acnes; two (6 per cent), Peptostreptococcus; and four (12 per cent), miscellaneous organisms. In all of the positive cultures on the blood-agar plates, except in those showing Propionibacterium acnes, there were five colonies or fewer. One patient had a clinical infection with Staphylococcus aureus that developed later, but the initial cultures of the wound had been positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis only. None of the bacteria that grew on culture were Staphylococcus aureus or the less common pathogenic gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas, or Klebsiella.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - To assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7 gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. For comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. Cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against Prevotella oralis, Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella bivia, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Bacteroides corporis, Bacteroides gracilis, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium naviforme and Propionibacterium acnes. Prevotella oris, Prevotella buccae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and Ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and Prevotella denticola, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides pneumosintes, and Peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. Strains of Veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Peptostreptococcus magnus showed MICs of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. The results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - Nosocomial infections of ocular conjunctiva in newborns delivered by cesarian section.
AB  - Colonization of the ocular conjunctiva in newborns delivered by cesarian section  occurs usually within the first day of life. We have studied the flora of the ocular conjunctiva at birth, from 19 newborns delivered by cesarian section, coming from two different maternity hospitals. Ocular conjunctiva cultures yielded the main predominant flora in both maternity hospitals considered. The most common genus of this flora are: Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium and Propionibacterium acnes. Peptostreptococcus productus, Neisseria, Eubacterium and Clostridium perfringens are isolated occasionally. In newborns delivered by cesarian section, this flora principally acquired may be the consequence of the presence of bacteria in the ambient air, as well as differences in care provided by the nosocomial personnel.
TI  - Susceptibility of oral bacteria to phenoxyethanol and phenoxyethanol/chlorhexidine combinations.
AB  - A total of 57 bacterial strains (26 different species) which may be isolated from subgingival plaque were tested for their in vitro susceptibility to phenoxycthanol, a commonly-used antiseptic and preservative. Ninety-five percent of the strains, including those associated with chronic inflammatory periodontal disease, were susceptible to concentrations of phenoxyethanol used topically (2% w/v). Phenoxyethanol at a concentration of 1% (w/v) was also found that to have a rapid bactericidal effect achieving a 99.9% kill in 5 minutes or less for species such as Bacterodides gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens, and Wolinella recta. Addition of chlorhexidine to phenoxyethanol resulted in a mixture with increased antibacterial activity. For most bacterial strains, the presence of chlorhexidine resulted in at least a four-fold decrease in the concentration of pheoxyethanol required for inhibition of growth. These results imply that phenoxyethanol may be useful in the treatment of chronic inflammatory periodontal disease either by itself or in combination with chlorhexidine.
TI  - In vitro activity of teicoplanin, vancomycin, A16686, clindamycin, erythromycin and fusidic acid against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of teicoplanin and A16686, two new glycopeptide antibiotics was determined against 196 isolates of anaerobic bacteria. The activity of teicoplanin and A16686, in comparison with that of vancomycin, clindamycin, erythromycin and fusidic acid was 2 to 16 times higher against the gram positive anaerobes, namely, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium species, Peptococcus species and Peptostreptococcus species. However, Bacteroides fragilis was resistant to teicoplanin and A16686 while Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bacteroides bivius were found to be sensitive.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity of the glycopeptide compounds vancomycin, teicoplanin and ramoplanin (A-16686/MDL 62,198).

TI  - Peptostreptococcus magnus does not cause hematogenous infections in experimental  arthroplasties.
AB  - Rabbits with cemented endoprostheses in the knee joints were given 1-ml intravenous injections of suspensions containing Peptostreptococcus magnus (3 x 10(8) colony-forming units/ml) on three consecutive days seven weeks postoperatively. The animals were killed after another seven weeks. The bacterial challenge did not result in infection. This is in contrast to a previous study using the same experimental system with another anaerobic bacterial species, Propionibacterium acnes, which caused infection in approximately 50% of the animals. Both these bacteria have previously been reported to cause late infections in human arthroplasties. The present results may indicate differences in the spreading mechanisms, i.e., that Peptostreptococcus magnus may have a limited ability to cause hematogenic infections and that late infections of endoprostheses by Peptostreptococcus magnus are due to perioperative contamination.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of purulent nasopharyngitis in children.
AB  - Cultures of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were obtained from the inferior nasal  meatus of 25 children with purulent nasopharyngitis and from 25 controls. Microorganisms were isolated from all specimens. A total of 98 isolates (3.9 per patient), 45 aerobes (1.8 per patient) and 53 anaerobes (2.1 per patient), were isolated in patients with purulent nasopharyngitis. Seventy-three isolates (2.9 per patient), 47 aerobes (1.9 per patient) and 26 anaerobes (1.0 per patient) were found in the controls. The organisms recovered in statistically significantly higher numbers in patients with nasopharyngitis were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus sp., Peptostreptococcus spp., Fusobacterium spp., and Bacteroides spp. The organisms recovered in significantly higher numbers in controls were Staphylococcus aureus and Propionibacterium acnes. beta-Lactamase activity was detected in 19 isolates recovered from 15 individuals (9 patients and 6 controls). These findings demonstrate the aerobic-anaerobic polymicrobial flora associated with purulent nasopharyngitis. Further studies are indicated to evaluate the pathogenic role of these organisms in this condition.
TI  - The intraocular environment and experimental anaerobic bacterial endophthalmitis.
AB  - Anaerobic bacteria are prevalent in conjunctival flora but have not been adequately investigated as possible causes of endophthalmitis. The mean oxidation-reduction potential (Eh) of the rabbit vitreous was found to be +25.1 mV, well within the limiting Eh value of many anaerobes. There was an oxygen pressure gradient in the vitreous ranging from 2.1 mm Hg immediately posterior to the lens to approximately 20 mm Hg adjacent to the medullary ray. Endophthalmitis was produced with pure cultures of Fusobacterium necrophorum, Propionibacterium acnes, and Peptostreptococcus magnus. Relatively small inoculates of F necrophorum caused severe, acute endophthalmitis with scleral perforation; P acnes and P magnus produced a self-limited endophthalmitis; and vitreoretinal fibrosis was a sequela of the Propionibacterium acnes infection.
TI  - Identification of anaerobic bacteria using high-performance liquid chromatography.
AB  - 20 species of the genera Clostridium, Bacteroides, Fusobacterium and the type strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptococcus asaccharolyticus, Veillonella parvula and Propionibacterium acnes were examined for the production of volatile (VFA) and nonvolatile (NVFA) short-chain fatty acids using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a column for organic acids (Aminex HPX-87H). 10 min are needed for sample preparation and the VFA and NVFA were detected simultaneously in a single chromatographic run. The total time required to run each chromatogram was approximately 60 min. With regard to the production of short-chain fatty acids in culture media it was possible to identify the species of the genera rapidly and clearly. The results illustrate the role of HPLC in determinating short-chain fatty acid products as an additional means for rapid differentiation between closely related anaerobic bacterial species. The aim of the method developed is to establish a complete automatization for the identification of anaerobic bacteria using an automatic sampling system and a microprocessor-controlled chromatography unit.
TI  - In vitro activity of ampicillin plus sulbactam against anaerobes compared to ampicillin and cefoxitin.
AB  - The antimicrobial susceptibility of 195 recent clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was studied to ampicillin alone, ampicillin + 1 mg/l sulbactam, ampicillin + 5 mg/l sulbactam, and cefoxitin by means of agar dilution tests. The ampicillin-sulbactam combinations were the most effective drugs against species of the Bacteroides fragilis group, the MIC90 of ampicillin + 5 mg/l sulbactam for B. fragilis being less than 1 mg/l, compared to 256 mg/l of ampicillin, 4 mg/l of ampicillin + 1 mg/l sulbactam, and 8 mg/l of cefoxitin. No significant difference between ampicillin alone and in combination with sulbactam was observed against gram-positive anaerobic rods, Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. with MIC's less than 2 mg/l.
TI  - The effect of carbon dioxide on the in vitro activity of erythromycin and RU-28965 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of erythromycin and RU-28965 (a novel macrolide antimicrobial with improved pharmacokinetics) was determined against a variety of anaerobic bacteria in anaerobic atmospheres with and without added carbon dioxide. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined using an antimicrobial incorporation technique in Wilkins-Chalgren agar (Oxoid, UK) containing saponinlysed horse blood to a final concentration of 10%. The inoculum used was approximately 10(4) colony forming units (cfu) contained in 10 microliters Wilkins-Chalgren broth, which was applied to the surface of the agar plates using a multipoint inoculator. Following inoculation, plates were incubated for 48 h at 37 degrees C in an anaerobic atmosphere containing 10% carbon dioxide or in hydrogen alone. The MIC of each antimicrobial for each organism examined was determined as the lowest concentration of the antimicrobial which completely inhibited growth of the inoculum. The minimum concentrations required to inhibit the growth of 50% (MIC50) and 90% (MIC90) of the bacteria examined were also determined. The MICs of erythromycin and RU-28965 for isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group, B. bivius and Fusobacterium spp. were generally 10-100 times greater when determined in the presence of carbon dioxide than when determined in hydrogen alone. The MICs of erythromycin and RU-28965 for B. melaninogenicus, Peptococcus spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., Clostridium perfringens, Cl. difficile and Propionibacterium acnes were less affected by the presence of carbon dioxide.
TI  - In vitro activity of vancomycin and teicoplanin against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of vancomycin and teicoplanin, a new glycopeptide antimicrobial, was determined against a total of 286 anaerobic bacteria including Bacteroides fragilis group (100), B. melaninogenicus (21), B. bivius (16), Fusobacterium spp. (15), Peptococcus spp. (20), Peptostreptococcus spp. (21), Clostridium perfringens (23), C. difficile (41) and Propionibacterium acnes (29). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined using an antimicrobial incorporation technique in Wilkins-Chalgren agar approximately 10(4) colony forming units (cfu) contained in 10 microliters Wilkins-Chalgren broth, which was applied to the surface of the agar plates using a multipoint inoculator. Following inoculation, plates were incubated for 48 h at 37 degrees C in an anaerobic atmosphere. Both vancomycin and teicoplanin were highly active against all the Gram-positive anaerobic bacteria examined, 90% of all isolates being inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml of either antimicrobial. Isolates of B. fragilis group and Fusobacterium spp. were resistant to vancomycin (MIC90 64 micrograms/ml) and teicoplanin (MIC90 128 micrograms/ml). Unexpectedly, isolates of B. melaninogenicus and B. bivius which were resistant to vancomycin (MIC90 64 and 128 micrograms/ml respectively) were sensitive to teicoplanin (MIC90 2 and 2 micrograms/ml respectively).
TI  - Microbiologic analyses of nasal polyp tissue.
AB  - Nasal polyps from 40 patients were cultured within 2 1/2 hours after surgical removal to determine whether microorganisms were present. The first 20 polyps were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, viruses, fungi, mycoplasmas, and mycobacteria. Of these 20 polyps, eight were sterile by all tests, one grew Cryptococcus albidus, one grew Sporobolomyces, one had large numbers of Peptostreptococcus micros and Propionibacterium acnes, greater than 10(6) colony-forming units per gram (cfu/gm), and nine had aerobic bacteria including 10 different species at levels less than 10(5) cfu/gm. The second 20 polyps were cultured for aerobic bacteria only; 11 polyps were positive. Overall, 14 of 26 polyps from patients with asthma and two of 14 polyps from patients without asthma were positive for aerobic bacteria at levels greater than 10(3) cfu/gm (p less than 0.05). Multiple aerobic bacterial species tended to occur in polyps from patients with asthma (11 of 26) more frequently than in those from patients without asthma (one of 14) (p less than 0.01). There was a highly significant positive correlation between tissue neutrophilia and bacterial count (r = +0.9; p less than 0.001). The results indicate that patients with asthma have a significantly higher number and a tendency to a greater variety of aerobic bacteria in nasal polyp tissue than patients without asthma and that the number of infiltrating neutrophils is directly related to the number of bacteria.
TI  - Arthropathic properties of cell wall polymers from normal flora bacteria.
AB  - Peptidoglycan-polysaccharide (PG-PS) fragments were purified from cell walls of group D streptococci (Streptococcus faecium, strains ATCC 9790 and F-24) with a protocol which minimizes autolytic activity and tested for ability to induce arthritis in rats. PG-PS fragments from cell walls of other normal flora bacteria (Peptostreptococcus productus, and Propionibacterium acnes), group A streptococci, and pseudomurein-PS fragments from cell walls of Methanobacterium formicicum, were similarly purified and tested. Upon intraarticular injection into rat ankles, all PG-PS polymers induced acute inflammation; pseudomurein-PS fragments were approximately five times less active than the PG-PS preparations. After intraperitoneal injection, P. acnes PG-PS induced a minimal acute arthritis, Peptostreptococcus productus PG-PS induced a moderately severe acute joint inflammation followed by a mild chronic arthritis, and both group A and group D streptococcal PG-PS induced severe acute arthritis which evolved into chronic, erosive joint disease; pseudomurein-PS fragments were without effect, consistent with a crucial role for the PG moiety of PG-PS. Chronic arthritis induced by group D streptococcal PG-PS subsided after 60 days, whereas that induced by group A streptococcal PG-PS was still active after 128 days. The arthropathic properties of this modest number of common normal flora bacteria suggest that different PG-PS structures derived from the normal flora have the potential to induce a wide range of responses, from transient acute to chronic erosive joint disease.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of Sch 34343 and other antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of Sch 34343 was determined against 575 strains of anaerobic bacteria by an agar-dilution method. Its activity was compared with that of benzylpenicillin, piperacillin, cefoxitin, imipenem, clindamycin, metronidazole, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, fusidic acid and bacitracin. Sch 34343 and imipenem were the most active agents tested. Based on these results, Sch 34343 appears to be a promising antimicrobial agent for anaerobic infections and warrants further clinical investigations.
TI  - Isolation of obligate anaerobic bacteria from bovine abscesses in sites other than the liver.
AB  - A survey in Japan showed that of 2036 slaughtered cattle 58(3%) had abscesses in  sites other than the liver. In 21 of the affected animals the lesions were pulmonary and in 32 abdominal (excluding hepatic); in five animals the lesions were found elsewhere (muscle 2, skin 2, bone 1). Nineteen (33%) of the 58 cattle also had abscesses in the liver. Obligate anaerobes alone were isolated from 17(29%) of the affected animals (Fusobacterium necrophorum 14, Bacteroides spp. 2, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius 1). A mixture of obligate anaerobes and aerobes or facultative anaerobes was isolated from 31 affected cattle: of these animals 21 yielded large and five small numbers of F. necrophorum; three yield fusobacteria other than F. necrophorum; and two yielded Propionibacterium acnes. The remaining 10 affected animals yielded only aerobes or facultative anaerobes. The numbers of viable obligate anaerobes in pus specimens were in the range 10(3)-10(9)/ml.
TI  - Diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis of the mandible.
AB  - The medical care of patients with diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis (DSO) of the mandible has been unsatisfactory. The main reasons for this have been insufficient knowledge of the disease and its natural history, difficulties in establishing the correct diagnosis, and the unknown etiology. The clinical features and natural history of the disease were studied by means of repeated radiographic and scintigraphic recordings. The biopsy technique was improved by using a slowly rotating coarse trepan bur. Histological and enzyme histochemical investigations were performed for determination of the histopathological diagnosis. Orthopantomograms in combination with intraoral views and 99mTc-scintigraphy were used for the radiographic diagnosis and follow-up studies. Bacteriological and serological investigations were performed in attempt to clarify the obscure etiology. The occurrence in the patients' sera of antibodies to antigens prepared from cultured bacteria was studied. ASTA, IgM, IgG, and IgA were determined and lymphocyte stimulation tests were performed. The investigations made it possible to distinguish DSO as a separate entity with rather characteristic clinical, histological and radiographic features. The histological diagnosis was facilitated by an improved biopsy technique and enzyme histochemical recordings. Different rather unspecific tissue reactions were together found to form a pattern which was strongly indicative of DSO. The radiographic and scintigraphic investigations gave valuable findings which increased the diagnostic accuracy and improved the prognostic and therapeutic judgements. The bacteriological and serological investigations indicated that propionibacterium acnes and peptostreptococcus intermedius were of etiological importance but could not explain the chronicity of the disease. The results of the different investigations gave a better understanding of DSO and made it possible to provide more appropriate care for patients in different stages of the disease. Long-term antibiotic therapy was found to have a positive influence on the course of the disease in its early stages, while cortisone therapy, and sometimes decortication, were found to be more effective in chronic stages.
TI  - Experimental otitis media in guinea pigs. Serum antibody response to Bacteroides  fragilis, Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius upon challenge.
AB  - The production of antibodies in serum was studied after inoculation of Bacteroides fragilis, Propionibacterium acnes or Peptostreptococcus anaerobius into the middle ear of guinea pigs. Inoculation of B. fragilis resulted in IgG and IgM serum antibodies at an early stage of the infection, while IgA antibodies were seldom detected and at a later stage. In contrast, inoculation of P. acnes or P. anaerobius induced no serum antibody response. Of these three species B. fragilis induced the most intense otitis, whereas P. anaerobius failed to induce otitis.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria in Sweden in 1983.
AB  - This review is concerned with anaerobic bacteria and antimicrobial susceptibility. Data on the susceptibility to different antimicrobials of anaerobic isolates in Sweden during 1983 is presented. Among the different bacterial groups, Clostridium perfringens, propionibacteria, anaerobic cocci and curved rods were found to be susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, clindamycin and chloramphenicol. C. difficile was susceptible to benzylpenicillin and imipenem, but resistant to cefoxitin. Most C. difficile strains were also susceptible to clindamycin and fusidic acid, while all strains were susceptible to metronidazole and vancomycin. The majority of the fusobacteria were susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, clindamycin, metronidazole and chloramphenicol. However, some strains were found to be resistant to penicillins. Against the Bacteroides fragilis group, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, metronidazole and imipenem had the best activity, whereas piperacillin and cefoxitin showed good activities. Most Bacteroides non-fragilis strains were susceptible to the antimicrobials tested. However, an increasing number of isolates were found to be resistant especially to penicillins when comparing with data from the last five years.

TI  - In vitro activity of U-57930E against anaerobic bacteria and its comparison with  clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline.
AB  - The in vitro activity of U-57930E, a pipecolic acid amide of clindamycin, was compared with those of clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline against 321 anaerobic clinical isolates. The MIC (micrograms/ml) of U-57930E that inhibited 95% Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus prevotii, B. melaninogenicus and P. asaccharolyticus was 0.0625; 0.03125 for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, B. vulgatus, Propionibacterium and Peptococcus species. Clindamycin, on the other hand, gave MIC values of 0.5 microgram/ml for B. fragilis, P. prevotii and P. asaccharolyticus, 0.25 for Propionibacterium sp. All strains of Clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml of U-57930E. Both clindamycin and U-57930E showed similar MIC values for all strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Propionibacterium acnes tested. The MIC values for ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline were within the expected range. U-57930E had a 4 approximately 8 fold lower MIC than clindamycin and is significantly active against anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Bacteriologic and serologic investigation in diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis (DSO) of the mandible.
AB  - An attempt was made to clarify the obscure origin of diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis (DSO) of the mandible. Bacteriologic investigations of specimens from diseased mandibles were performed with special attention to anaerobic culture technique. Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus intermedius were in some patients found to be of etiologic importance. Sampling techniques and associated problems are discussed. An examination was made for antibodies in the patients' sera against antigens prepared from bacterial isolates. ASTA, IgM, IgG, and IgA were determined. Lymphocyte-stimulation tests were performed. The inflammatory events and chronicity of the disease could not be explained by the immunologic findings.
TI  - The use of an anaerobic incubator for the isolation of anaerobes from clinical samples.
AB  - An anaerobic incubator was compared with a standard jar system for the isolation  of anaerobes from clinical material. Seventy specimens were selected as likely to yield anaerobes: 342 different anaerobes were isolated in the incubator and 347 in anaebrobic jars. These included Bacteroides spp (43%), Peptococcus spp (26%), Peptostreptococcus spp (13%), Veillonella spp (7%), Fusobacterium spp (7%), Clostridium spp (2%) and miscellaneous Gram-positive nonsporing bacilli (2%). Differences in isolation rates for each system were inconsistent and minor. Sixteen anaerobes were chosen for quantitative tests at the beginning and end of the study period. Miles and Misra counts showed a slight advantage of the incubator for F nucleatum, but no difference for B fragilis, B thetaiomicron, B uniformis, B bivius, B corrodens, F mortiferum, Ps anaerobius, P prevotii or Propionibacterium acnes. In almost all cases, colonies in anaerobic jars were slightly larger than those in the incubator. Disc antibiotic sensitivity tests gave the same results in each system, at the beginning and end of the study period. The anaerobic incubator provides an effective means of isolation of anaerobes in a clinical laboratory. However, several design features of the prototype would require change if the system were introduced.
TI  - Evaluation of a metronidazole disk test for the presumptive identification of anaerobes.
AB  - A total of 632 bacterial strains recovered under anaerobic conditions from clinical specimens were tested from their susceptibility to metronidazole by a disk diffusion test using 5 micrograms metronidazole disks. Three-hundred-fifty-five of the 632 bacterial strains exhibited susceptibility the metronidazole, and each was determined to be an obligate anaerobe. The remaining 277 isolates showed resistance to the 5 micrograms disk. Of these resistant strains, 257 were determined to be facultative anaerobes, while 20 (18 Propionibacterium acnes, one Peptostreptococcus sp., and one Peptococcus magnus) were identified as obligate anaerobes. Potential use of this disk diffusion test for identifying the anaerobic status of bacteria is discussed.
TI  - Streptococcus pneumoniae and three species of anaerobic bacteria in experimental  otitis media in guniea pigs.
AB  - Three species of anaerobic bacteria commonly isolated in upper respiratory tract  infections in humans were studied in an animal model of otitis media. The ability of Propionibacterium acnes to induce acute otitis media was comparable with that of streptococcus pneumoniae, the classic middle ear pathogen. The response to Peptostreptococcus micros was weak and irregular, and no effects of Bacteroides asaccharolyticus were observed despite the use of high doses (10(8) colony-forming unite per ear). The results of this study support the contention that anaerobic bacteria such as P. acnes may be true pathogens in middle ear infections.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of cervical adenitis in children.
AB  - Needle aspirates from 53 inflamed cervical lymph glands were studies for aerobic  and anaerobic bacteria and mycobacteria. Bacterial growth was achieved in 45 patients (85%). Sixty-six bacterial isolates were recovered, averaging 1.5 isolates per specimen (0.8 aerobes and 0.7 anaerobes), with as many as 4 isolates in some specimens. Aerobic organisms alone were recovered in 27 aspirates (60%) of the 45 culture-positive aspirates, anaerobic bacteria alone in 8 (18%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 9 specimens (20%). Mycobacterium scrofulaceum was recovered in one (2%). The predominant aerobic organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (14 isolates) and group A beta hemolytic streptococci (8). A total of 31 anaerobes were recovered, including gram-positive cocci (9, including 6 Peptococcus sp. and 3 Peptostreptococcus sp.), 8 Bacteroides sp. (including 3 B. melaninogenicus), 5 Propionibacterium acnes, and 4 Fusobacterium nucleatum. These data demonstrate the role of anaerobic organisms in cervical lymphadenitis and the need to culture aspirated material for both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.

TI  - Kinetic parameters of lactate dehydrogenases of some rumen bacterial species, the anaerobic ciliate Isotricha prostoma and mixed rumen microorganisms.
AB  - A number of kinetic parameters of the lactate dehydrogenases of three rumen bacterial species (Peptostreptococcus productus, Propionibacterium acnes and Actinomyces viscosus), the rumen ciliate Isotricha prostoma and mixed rumen microorganisms (MRM) with respect to NADH, pyruvate, fructose-1,6-diphosphate (FDP) as well as the effects of several nucleotide phosphates were studied. Partially purified LDH of Peptostr. productus had the same kinetic parameters as in crude cell free extracts. Values for Km, determined by Michaelis-Menten kinetics with pyruvate as the substrate, were in the same range for all lactate dehydrogenases. After feeding a cow, changes in the apparent Km and Vmax values for NADH of the total LDH activity in MRM were followed. It is suggested that of the factors studied the ratio NADH/NAD(H) and ATP are the most important regulatory factors for the lactate dehydrogenases of mixed rumen microorganisms.
TI  - Comparison of three methods of susceptibility testing of bacteroidaceae, peptococcaceae and other anaerobes to doxycycline.
AB  - The in vitro activity of doxycycline against 147 strains of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes was determined by broth dilution, agar dilution and agar diffusion tests. The strains were isolated from clinical specimens in 1977. Saccharolytic Bacteroides strains (39 B. fragilis, 6 B. thetaiotaomicron, 4 B. vulgatus) showed broth dilution MICs of less than or equal to 0.0625-4.0 microgram/ml after 5 h incubation and MICs of less than or equal to 16 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation at 37 degrees C. With strains of B. oralis, B. melaninogenicus ss. intermedius, B. corrodens, Veillonella sp. and Megasphaera elsdenii the broth dilution MICs were less than or equal to 0.0625-32 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation. Peptostreptococcus spp., Propionibacterium acnes, Eubacterium sp., Bifidobacterium sp. and Clostridium sp. had broth dilution MICs of less than or equal to 2 microgram/ml, whereas Peptococcus spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.0625 to greater than 32 microgram/ml. With the great majority of strains tested, MICs were 2 to 256 times higher in agar than in broth dilution tests. Clinical and experimental studies seem to be needed to determine which of the in vitro data are correlated to the outcome of doxycycline therapy. Several groups and species were separately considered for statistical analysis of the relationship between zone size and MIC. With gram-positive anaerobes, correlation was poor between broth dilution MIC and zone size (correlation coefficients r = - 0.168 for Peptococcaceae, and r = - 0.108 for P. acnes). When calculating the regression lines for agar dilution MICs and zone diameters, a higher correlation was found (r = - 0.9 for Peptococcaceae; r = - 0.397 for P. acnes). With B. fragilis and other Bacteroides species correlation coefficients were r = - 0.807 to r = - 0.891 for broth and agar dilution MICs and zone size but stochastic linearity was lacking.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria in late infections following orthopedic surgery.
AB  - Twelve patients with late anaerobic infection following hip or knee arthroplasty  or tibia osteosynthesis are presented. Peptococci (Peptococcus asaccharolyticus, P. magnus, P. prevotii) and peptostreptococci (Peptostreptococcus micros, P. anaerobius, P. parvulus) were present in nine of the cases. Anaerobic gram-positive or -negative rods were found in three cases (Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces israelii, and Bacteroides fragilis). Antibodies against the isolated bacteria were detected in sera of nine patients. Anaerobic bacteria seem to be responsible for some of the late reactions that may follow arthroplasty or osteosynthesis.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of the maternal cervix and newborn gastric  fluid and conjunctiva: a prospective study.
AB  - Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were performed on cervical swabs from 35 mothers and their newborn infants' gastric aspirates and conjunctival sacs. Four hundred seventy-nine isolates were obtained; 287 were aerobes and 192 were anaerobes. The cervical and gastric cultures overall yielded a similar flora, but this was not always the case when one compared mothers with their own newborn infants. The conjunctival cultures yielded about half of the number of bacteria per specimen that the gastric contents yielded, and a repeat conjunctival culture done 48 hours later showed a marked reduction in the number of potentially pathogenic bacteria isolated. The predominant aerobes isolated were Staphylococcus epidermidis, diphtheroids, viridans streptococci and Haemophilus vaginalis. The predominant anaerobes were the Bacteroides fragilis group, Propionibacterium acnes, Peptococcus, other Bacteroides and Peptostreptococcus organisms. Statistical analysis revealed significant positive correlation between the isolation of certain groups of organisms and increased duration of pregnancy, increased baby's weight, and prolonged duration of labor.
TI  - Anaerobic and aerobic bacteriology of acute conjunctivitis.
AB  - Aerobic and anaerobic cultures and clinical data were obtained from 131 patients  presenting with acute conjunctivitis. Similar cultures were obtained from 60 noninflamed individuals. Anaerobes were isolated from 66 patients, 51 times in mixed culture with aerobes and 15 times (11.5%) as the only isolates. Aerobes only were recovered in 54 patients. The organisms found to be statistically significantly more commonly recovered from eyes with conjunctivitis were Staphylococcus aureus, Hemophilus influenzae, Peptostreptococcus, and Propionibacterium acnes. No statistical difference was present between the bacterial flora of the eyes with unilateral conjunctivitis when compared to their uninvolved mates in 20 cases in which only one eye was involved.
TI  - Effect of silver nitrate application on the conjunctival flora of the newborn: and the occurrence of clostridial conjunctivitis.
AB  - Newborn conjunctival cultures were obtained from 35 babies prior to silver nitrate application and 48 hours later. On initial culture, 46 facultative bacteria and 27 anaerobes were recovered; 48 facultative and 18 anaerobes were recovered after 48 hours. Haemophilus vaginalis, Bacteroides species and anaerobic cocci decreased in numbers, whereas S. epidermidis, Micrococcus and Propionibacterium acnes increased during this time interval. Clostridial species were isolated from two cases who developed conjunctivitis, along with Peptostreptococcus in one of the cases. In vitro experiments demonstrated lack of killing of C. perfringens in silver nitrate concentrations of 0.1 percent, even after 24 hours exposure.
TI  - [Growth of non-sporing anaerobes in an oxygen-free blood culture system (author's transl)].
AB  - The efficacy of the commercially available Vacutainer blood culture system to support the growth of non-sporing anaerobes was compared with two laboratory-prepared blood culture media (supplemented thioglycollate medium and brain heart infusion). The media were inoculated with 10, 100 and 1000 organisms of the species tested, and the number of colony-forming units was determined at intervals of 8-10 hrs. Analogous experiments were performed with batches of the media to which 10% vol/vol of human blood had been added. From the results obtained with strains of Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides splanchnicus, Sphaerophorus necrophorus, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Propionibacterium acnes it became obvious that growth of non-sporing anaerobes was significantly enhanced in the Vacutainer culture tubes, whereas Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcus spp. grew equally well in all the media tested.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria in otitis media.
AB  - Anaerobic bacteria, Peptostrepotococcus intermedius and Propionibacterium acnes,  were found in mixed culture specimens from four to ten tested cases of chronic secretory otitis media. These anaerobic bacteria were in a mixed infection flora with aerobic bacteria most often Staphylococcus epidermidis and Cornybacterium sp. which do not fit any established species. The findings of anaerobic bacteria in otitis media is consistent with the sporadic report of the involvement of anaerobic bacteria in otitis media in the literature since 1898.

TI  - [Susceptibility to Thiamphenicol and Chloramphenicol of Anaerobic Bacteria (author's transl)].
AB  - The in vitro susceptibility to thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol of 272 anaerobes, most of which were recent clinical isolated, was determined by broth dilution tests, With chloramphenicol, 133 anaerobic gram-negative non-sporing rods (48 Bacteroides fragilis, 13 B. thetaiotaomicron, 14 B. oralis, 16 Sphaerophorus varius etc.) had MIC values of 0.03 through 16 microng/ml. Very similar results (MIC, 0.06-16 microng/ml) were obtained with thiamphenicol. In concentrations of 4 microng/ml or less chloramphenicol inhibited 90.2% and thiamphenicol 78.95% of the strains. Strains with only moderate sensitivity to both antibiotics (MIC, 8 or 16 microng/ml) belonged to B. fragilis or other Bacteroides species. Members of the Fusobacterium and Sphaerophorus group were susceptible to less than or equal to 2 microng chloramphenicol/ml and less than or equal to 4 microng thiamphenicol/ml respectively. With both antibiotics, 102 strains of gram-positive non-sporing anaerobes (P. acnes, Peptostreptococcus spp., Peptococcus spp.) were susceptible to less than or equal to 8 microng/ml. Of 37 Clostridium isolates, 35 (belonging to C. perfringens, C. septicum, C. cadaveris etc.) were inhibited by concentrations of 8 microng/ml or less of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol. Only one strain each of C. perfringens and Clostridium sp. had an MIC of 16 microng thiamphenicol/ml. Accordingly, resistance to thiamphenicol or chloramphenicol was not observed. A standardized monodisk agardiffusion test was performed on 40 Bacteroidaceae, 18 Peptococcaceae and 20 C, (P.) acnes strains. Only a poor correlation was observed between MIC and zone size for thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol. Therefore, inhibition zone diameter measurement cannot be regarded as a reliable method to detect chloramphenicol or thiamphenicol resistance in anaerobes. Thiamphenicol, which is virtually as active against anaerobes as chloramphenicol but lacks serious toxicity, may well play an important role in the therapy of various anaerobic infections.
TI  - [Antibacterial and bactericidal activity of tinidazole against anaerobic bacteria comparing with metronidazole (author's transl)].
AB  - Antibacterial activity of tinidazole (1-2-(ethylsulfonyl)-2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole) against anaerobic bacteria including Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium, Propionibacterium, Bacteroides and Fusobacterium was studied by agar dilution method comparing with metronidazole. In addition to this work, bactericidal effect of tinidazole and metronidazole against P. prevotii, B. fragilis ss. fragilis and F. varium was examined by quantitative culture method after incubation in GAM broth containing of 4 MIC, 2 MIC, 1 MIC and 1/2 MIC of both drugs against each of three strains for 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours. All the strains of Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus including P. anaerobius, P. saccharolyticus, P. prevotii and Ps. anaerobius and others were susceptible to a concentration of 6.25 mcg/ml of this drug. A concentration of 3.13 mcg/ml inhibited all strains of Bacteroides including B. fragilis ss. fragilis (12 strains), ss. vulgatus (5 strains), ss. thetaiotaomicron (4 strains) and ss. distasonis (2 strains). To this concentration all strains of Fusobacterium including F. varium (20 strains), F. mortiferum (2 strains) and other Fusobacterium sp. (5 strains) were susceptible. On the contrary, Propionibacterium acnes (6 strains) was resistant to 100 mcg/ml or more of tinidazole and metronidazole. The antibacterial activity of tinidazole was stronger against Bacteroides than that of metronidazole, while almost equal against Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium and Fusobacterium. Tinidazole was bactericidal against F. varium in a concentration of 2 MIC till 24 hours of incubation but did not show such an activity on B. fragilis ss. fragilis in same concentration even after 12 hours of incubation. On the other hand, metronidazole was bactericidal against B. fragilis ss. fragilis while was not against F. varium. Against P. prevotii bactericidal activity of both drugs was similar. Tinidazole as well as metronidazole is an excellent chemotherapeutic agent against anaerobic bacteria excluding Propionibacterium acnes and Bifidobacterium adolescentis.
TI  - Anaerobic infections in children: a prospective study.
AB  - The prevalence and significance of anaerobic infections in patients at St. Louis  Children's Hospital were studied prospectively for a one-year period. Blood, selected body fluids, and aspirates obtained from abscesses or areas of cellulitis were cultured using special anaerobic collection and processing techniques. Infected peritoneal fluid from patients with gastrointestinal disease yielded a large proportion of all anaerobic isolates. The types of organisms isolated were common inhabitants of the intestinal tract. Anaerobic organisms were recovered from only 0.75% of all blood cultures; anaerobic bacteremia accounted for 5.8% of all clinically significant bacteremic episodes (8.7% in the neonatal period and 4.8% in children over 1 month of age). Serious anaerobic infections occurred more frequently in the compromised host or in newborn infants than in otherwise healthy children. Since anaerobic organisms cause a small proportion of infectious diseases in a general pediatric population, the cost of refined bacteriologic techniques for the isolation and identification of these organisms is not warranted in most community hospitals. However, such a program should be available in selected tertiary care centers to aid in the management of certain high-risk patients.
TI  - Bacteriology of normal and infected conjunctiva.
AB  - The conjunctivas of 273 inflamed eyes were cultured by both aerobic and anaerobic techniques. Isolations were obtained from 267 (97.8%) of the eyes. Aerobic organisms were isolated from 237 (86.8%) of the conjunctivas. Staphylococcus aureus from 63 (23.1%) of the diseased eyes was the aerobic pathogen most often isolated. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 172 (63.0%) of the conjunctivas. Propionibacterium acnes was isolated from 126 (46.2%) of the conjunctivas, and Peptostreptococcus species were isolated from 80 (29.3%) of the conjunctivas. Comparison with the bacteriology of 96 normal eyes showed that anaerobes play a much greater role as etiological agents of conjunctivitis than formerly believed. When anaerobic bacteria were isolated, they appeared on the average in 7 days, indicating that they may be missed by ordinary bacteriological culturing.
TI  - Studies on the cecal microflora of commercial broiler chickens.
AB  - A study was made of the cecal microflora isolated from broilers (5-week-old) reared under typical commercial husbandry conditions. Three hundred and twenty-five bacterial strains (randomly isolated from colonies representing 49 to 81% of the microscopic count) were isolated from cecal digesta of six animals on a rumen fluid roll tube medium (M98-5). Seventy-seven percent of these strains consisted of strict anaerobes: gram-negative, pleomorphic cocci (5.2%), Peptostreptococcus (1.5%), gram-positive rods (36.1% as Propionibacterium acnes and Eubacterium sp.), gram-negative rods (18.6% as Bacteroides clostridiiformis, B. hypermegas and B. fragilis) and sporeforming rods (15.7% as Clostridium sp.). Two types of facultatively anaerobic bacteria (gram-positive cocci and Escherichia coli) were also isolated and constituted 17.5% of the remaining flora. The distribution of the bacterial groups isolated from six cecal samples varied considerably. Data on the growth requirements of anaerobic strains indicated that many could be cultured in a simple medium consisting of an energy source, minerals, reducing agent, Trypticase, and yeast extract (or a vitamin mixture in place of yeast extract). The growth of some of these bacteria was also enhanced by CO(2) and rumen fluid. These preliminary data suggest that some of the more numerous anaerobes isolated from the chicken cecum may not require complex nutrients for growth and, in fact, may be nutritionally similar to rumen anaerobes.
