TI  == microbial dynamics during conversion from supragingival to subgingival biofilms in an in vitro model.
AB  == the development of dental caries and periodontal diseases result from distinct shifts in the microbiota of the tooth-associated biofilm. this in vitro study aimed to investigate changes in biofilm composition and structure, during the shift from a "supragingival" aerobic to a "subgingival" anaerobic profile. biofilms consisting of actinomyces oris, candida albicans, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar were aerobically grown in saliva-containing medium on hydroxyapatite discs. after 64 h, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus anginosus were further added along with human serum, while culture conditions were shifted to microaerophilic. after 96 h, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were finally added and the biofilm was grown anaerobically for another 64 h. at the end of each phase, biofilms were harvested for species-specific quantification and localization. apart from c. albicans, all other species gradually increased during aerobic and microaerophilic conditions,  but remained steady during anaerobic conditions. biofilm thickness was doubled during the microaerophilic phase, but remained steady throughout the anaerobic phase. extracellular polysaccharide presence was gradually reduced throughout the growth period. biofilm viability was reduced during the microaerophilic conversion, but was recovered during the anaerobic phase. this in vitro study has characterized the dynamic structural shifts occurring in an oral biofilm model during the switch from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, potentially modeling the  conversion of supragingival to subgingival biofilms. within the limitations of this experimental model, the findings may provide novel insights into the ecology of oral biofilms. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == axenic culture of a candidate division tm7 bacterium from the human oral cavity and biofilm interactions with other oral bacteria.
AB  == the diversity of bacterial species in the human oral cavity is well recognized, but a high proportion of them are presently uncultivable. candidate division tm7  bacteria are almost always detected in metagenomic studies but have not yet been  cultivated. in this paper, we identified candidate division tm7 bacterial phylotypes in mature plaque samples from around orthodontic bonds in subjects undergoing orthodontic treatment. successive rounds of enrichment in laboratory media led to the isolation of a pure culture of one of these candidate division tm7 phylotypes. the bacteria formed filaments of 20 to 200 mum in length within agar plate colonies and in monospecies biofilms on salivary pellicle and exhibited some unusual morphological characteristics by transmission electron microscopy, including a trilaminated cell surface layer and dense cytoplasmic deposits. proteomic analyses of cell wall protein extracts identified abundant polypeptides predicted from the tm7 partial genomic sequence. pleiomorphic phenotypes were observed when the candidate division tm7 bacterium was grown in dual-species biofilms with representatives of six different oral bacterial genera. the tm7 bacterium formed long filaments in dual-species biofilm communities with actinomyces oris or fusobacterium nucleatum. however, the tm7 isolate grew as short rods or cocci in dual-species biofilms with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra, or streptococcus gordonii, forming notably robust biofilms with the latter two species. the ability to cultivate tm7 axenically should majorly advance understanding of the physiology,  genetics, and virulence properties of this novel candidate division oral bacterium.

TI  == age-dependent changes in porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella species/phylotypes in healthy gingiva and inflamed/diseased sub-gingival sites.
AB  == objectives: early colonisation of oral surfaces by periodontal pathogens presents a significant risk factor for subsequent development of destructive disease affecting tissues that support the dentition. the aims of the present study were  to establish the age-dependent relationship between sub-gingival profiles of 22 prevotella species/phylotypes in children, adolescents and adults from an isolated aboriginal community and, further, to use this information to identify prevotella species that could serve as microbial risk indicators. materials and methods: dna isolated from sub-gingival plaque samples (three healthy sites and three inflamed/diseased sites) from adults, adolescents and children was screened for porphyromonas gingivalis load and 22 prevotella species/phylotypes by species-specific pcr. results: a noticeable feature in adolescents was the marked increase in colonisation by p. gingivalis across all test sites. the mean number  of prevotella species/phylotypes colonising inflamed/diseased sub-gingival sites  increased with age. progressive partitioning of selected prevotella species/phylotypes to healthy or inflamed/diseased sites was evident. prevalence  of prevotella intermedia, prevotella oral clone p4pb_24 and prevotella oris increased significantly with age in diseased sites. similarly, significant age-dependent increase in colonisation of healthy as well as inflamed/diseased sub-gingival sites was apparent for prevotella oralis, prevotella multiformis, prevotella denticola, prevotella strain p4p_53 and prevotella oral clone br014. conclusion: early colonisation of children by p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and prevotella oral clone p4pb_24 provides indication of risk for subsequent development of periodontal disease. clinical relevance: in the present study, the complexity of prevotella species within gingival sites is explored as a basis for evaluating contribution of prevotella species to disease.

TI  == colonisation of gingival epithelia by subgingival biofilms in vitro: role of "red complex" bacteria.
AB  == objectives: biofilm formation on tooth surface results in colonisation and invasion of the juxtaposed gingival tissue, eliciting strong inflammatory responses that lead to periodontal disease. this in vitro study investigated the  colonisation of human gingival multi-layered epithelium by multi-species subgingival biofilms, and evaluated the relative effects of the "red complex" species (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola). methods: the grown biofilm consisted of fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, veillonella dispar, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, t. denticola, actinomyces oris, streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus oralis, or its variant lacking the "red complex". after 48h in co-culture with the gingival epithelia, the bacterial species in the biofilm were quantified, whereas their localisation on the cell surface was investigated by combining confocal-laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation  (fish), as well as by scanning electron microscopy (sem). results: exclusion of the "red complex" quantitatively affected s. oralis, but not other species. the "red-complex" species were all able to colonise the gingival epithelial cells. a  co-localisation trend was observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola, as determined by fish. however, in the absence of all three "red complex" bacteria from the biofilm, an immense colonisation of streptococci (potentially s. oralis) was observed on the gingival epithelia, as confirmed by both clsm and sem. conclusions: while the "red complex" species synergise in colonizing gingival epithelia, their absence from the biofilm enhances streptococcal colonisation. this antagonism with streptococci reveals that the "red complex" may regulate biofilm virulence, with potential implications in periodontal pathogenesis.

TI  == impact of early colonizers on in vitro subgingival biofilm formation.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early colonizing species on the structure and the composition of the bacterial community developing in a subgingival 10-species biofilm model system. the model included streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, actinomycesoris, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp.  nucleatum, veillonella dispar, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. based on literature, we considered streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, and actinomyces oris as early colonizers and examined their role in the biofilms by either a delayed addition to the consortium, or by not inoculating at all the biofilms with these species. we quantitatively evaluated the resulting biofilms by real-time quantitative pcr and further compared the structures using confocal  laser scanning microscopy following fluorescence in situ hybridisation. the absence of the early colonizers did not hinder biofilm formation. the biofilms reached the same total counts and developed to normal thickness. however, quantitative shifts in the abundances of individual species were observed. in the absence of streptococci, the overall biofilm structure appeared looser and more dispersed. moreover, besides a significant increase of p. intermedia and a decrease of p. gingivalis , p. intermedia appeared to form filamented long chains that resembled streptococci. a. oris, although growing to significantly higher abundance in absence of streptococci, did not have a visible impact on the biofilms. hence, in the absence of the early colonizers, there is a pronounced effect on p. intermedia and p. gingivalis that may cause distinct shifts in the structure of the biofilm. streptococci possibly facilitate the establishment of p. gingivalis into subgingival biofilms, while in their absence p. intermedia became more dominant and forms elongated chains.

TI  == validation of a quantitative real-time pcr assay and comparison with fluorescence microscopy and selective agar plate counting for species-specific quantification  of an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  == background and objective: subgingival biofilms are the prime etiological factor of periodontal disease. owing to their complex polymicrobial nature, quantification of individual bacterial species within the biofilm for research and diagnostic purposes can be methodologically challenging. the aims of this study were to establish a quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) assay to quantify the bacteria used in our 10-species in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm model and to compare the quantitative outcome with fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming  unit (cfu) counts on selective agar plates. material and methods: the 10 species  included in the in vitro biofilm were streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, actinomyces oris, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. the numbers of each species were quantified at two time points using qpcr, microscopy counting following fluorescence in-situ hybridization (fish) or immunofluorescence staining, and counting of cfus after growth on selective agar plates. results: all 10 species were successfully quantified using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, and the eight species culturable on selective agar plates were also quantified by counting the numbers  of cfus after growth on selective agar. in early biofilm cultures, all methods showed a significant correlation, although the absolute numbers differed between  methods. in late biofilm cultures, measurements obtained using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, but not by cfu counts, maintained significant correlation. cfu counts yielded lower values than did measurements made using the other two methods. conclusion: quantitative pcr and epifluorescence microscopy can be easily combined with each other to determine species-specific bacterial numbers within biofilms. however, conventional bacterial cultures cannot be as efficiently combined using these molecular detection methods. this may be crucial in designing and selecting appropriate clinical diagnostic methods for subgingival biofilm samples.

TI  == coaggregation between prevotella oris and porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == background/purpose: the coaggregation of bacteria has been defined as one of the  most important processes in the oral infection such as periodontitis. prevotella  oris and porphyromonas gingivalis, which are two of the periodontopathogens, are  frequently detected in severe forms of periodontal diseases. however, the interaction between p. oris and p. gingivalis is still unknown. in this study, the coaggregation of p. oris with nine oral bacterial species including p. gingivalis was examined. methods: all bacteria used in this study were cultured anaerobically and suspended in coaggregation buffer. each cell suspension was mixed in a test tube and subjected to shaking at room temperature for 1 hour. subsequently, the coaggregation values were scored. furthermore, the effects of various chemical reagents, and heat, proteinase k, and serum treatment were examined. results: in this study, p. oris coaggregated only with p. gingivalis. a heat-stable, nonproteinous component of p. oris and a heat-labile, proteinous component of p. gingivalis play important roles in this coaggregation. in addition, this coaggregation was inhibited by l-arginine, l-lysine, and nalpha-p-tosyl-l-lysine. therefore, it was considered that a cell surface protein on p. gingivalis, such as gingipain, may be involved in the coaggregation. furthermore, the coaggregation was not inhibited by serum treatment. conclusion:  this is the first report to describe the coaggregation of p. oris and p. gingivalis. our study proposes the possibility that p. oris may promote the colonization of p. gingivalis in an early stage of biofilm formation. furthermore, this coaggregation may contribute to the initiation and progression  of periodontitis.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == stimulants of toll-like receptors 2 and 4 are elevated in saliva of periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects.
AB  == aim: because the absorption of stimulants of toll-like receptor (tlr)2 and tlr4 from the gastrointestinal tract into the circulation has been proposed to promote the development of atherosclerosis and insulin resistance, we aimed to quantify the abundance of stimulants of tlr2 and tlr4 in human saliva. methods: a recently developed bioassay based upon measurement of nf-kappab activation in tlr-deficient human embryonic kidney (hek)-293 cells transfected with human tlr2  or tlr4 and calibrated with synthetic bacterial lipopeptide (pam(3) csk(4) ) or escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (lps), was used to establish the normal range of tlr stimulants in saliva of 20 healthy subjects and 20 subjects with periodontal disease. results: median soluble stimulants of tlr2 and tlr4 were significantly higher in saliva of periodontitis patients compared with saliva of  healthy subjects; 3450 versus 77 ng/ml pam(3) csk(4) equivalents (p<0.0001) and 138 versus 7 ng/ml lps equivalents, respectively (p<0.0001). salivary tlr stimulant levels remained relatively stable in healthy subjects over several days. six strains of oral gram-negative bacteria, including tannerella forsythensis, lysobacter enzymogenes, prevotella intermedia, prevotella oris and  porphyromonas gingivalis, from a panel of nine examined did not stimulate tlr4-dependent signalling. conclusions: elevated salivary tlr stimulants may represent a novel mechanism by which periodontitis increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and insulin resistance.

TI  == characterization of oral lactobacilli as potential probiotics for oral health.
AB  == introduction: intestinal lactobacilli have been successfully used as probiotics to treat gastrointestinal disorders, but only limited data are available for the  probiotic properties of oral lactobacilli to combat oral diseases. we aimed to characterize oral lactobacilli for their potential probiotic properties according to the international guidelines for the evaluation of probiotics, and to select potential probiotic strains for oral health. methods: the study included 67 salivary and subgingival lactobacilli of 10 species, isolated from healthy humans. all strains were identified using amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis, tested for antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens, tolerance of  low ph and bile content. thereafter, the lysozyme tolerance and antibiotic susceptibility of 22 potential probiotic strains were assessed. results: the majority of strains suppressed the growth of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and streptococcus mutans, but none inhibited candida albicans. the lowest ph tolerated by lactobacilli following 4 h of incubation was ph 2.5, but none of the strains grew at this ph. all strains tolerated a high concentration of lysozyme (10 mg/ml) and half of the strains tolerated a high concentration of human bile [5% volume/volume (v/v)]. four lactobacillus plantarum and two lactobacillus oris strains expressed resistance to tetracycline and/or doxycycline. conclusions: strains of l. plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus rhamnosus expressed both high antimicrobial activity and high tolerance of environmental stress. the absence of transferable antibiotic-resistance genes in l. plantarum strains remains to be confirmed. these results suggest a potential for oral lactobacilli to be used as probiotics  for oral health.

TI  == [study of bacteriology on local application of tinidazole stilus in treatment for periodontitis].
AB  == objective: the study was designed to evaluate the antiseptic efficacy of tinidazole stilus against periodontal pathogen. methods: a total of 41 patients with periodontitis were included in this study. 26 of them were treated by tindazole stilus and other 15 cases were treated by metronidazole stilus as controls. the prevalence of subgingival bacteria from both group were examined. results: the eliminate rates for black pigmented anaerobic rod (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedius, prevotella melaninogenicus), fusobacteriums,  prevotella oris, prevotella oralis, eubacterium and actinomyces were 95.8% 94.1%, 83.3% and 76.5%. the anti-bacterial efficiency of tinidazole against periodontal  pathogen was significantly higher than that of metronidazole (p < 0.05). conclusion: it appears to be effective to use tinidazole stilus as local application against periodontal pathogens.

TI  == antibacterial activity of fifth-generation dentin bonding systems.
AB  == past concepts that the pulp does not become infected until an actual carious exposure takes place have been challenged. the antibacterial effects of the dentin bonding systems single bond, prime&bond nt, and excite were evaluated using the bacteria streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, streptococcus intermedius, lactobacillus acidophilus, prevotella oris, prevotella bivia, prevotella denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, and clostridium  ramosum with a disk diffusion method. chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. after incubation zones of inhibited bacterial growth were measured. prime&bond nt showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. lactobacillus acidophilus and streptococcus mutans were remarkably resistant to single bond, whereas ex produced no inhibitory effect on porphyromonas endodontalis, although  the adhesive produced the maximum halo inhibition to streptococcus mutans (15+/-1 mm), showing an antibacterial effect closest to chlorhexidine. the variety of results obtained in this study suggest that antibacterial properties of current dentin adhesives may depend on components that are originally incorporated to promote adhesion.

TI  == activities of gemifloxacin (sb 265805, lb20304) compared to those of other oral antimicrobial agents against unusual anaerobes.
AB  == the activities of gemifloxacin (sb 265805, lb20304) and comparator agents were determined by an agar dilution method against 419 clinical strains of less-commonly identified species of anaerobes. gemifloxacin was generally more active than trovafloxacin against gram-positive strains by one to two dilutions.  peptostreptococci (peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, peptostreptococcus magnus, peptostreptococcus micros, and peptostreptococcus prevotii) and porphyromonas spp. (porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas canoris, porphyromonas gingivalis, and porphyromonas macacae) were all susceptible to </=0.25 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml. the mics of gemifloxacin at which 90% of the following strains were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=2 microgram/ml: actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, clostridium innocuum, clostridium clostridioforme, anaerobiospirillum spp., bacteroides tectum, bacteroides ureolyticus, bacteroides gracilis (now campylobacter gracilis), prevotella intermedia, prevotella heparinolytica, and the prevotella oris-buccae  group. fusobacterium naviforme and fusobacterium necrophorum were also susceptible to </=2 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml, while fusobacterium varium  strains exhibited a bimodal pattern; the other fusobacterium species, such as fusobacterium ulcerans and fusobacterium russii, as well as veillonella spp., the prevotella melaninogenica group, prevotella bivia, clostridium difficile, and bilophila wadsworthia were relatively resistant to gemifloxacin (mic(90)s, >/=4 microgram/ml).

TI  == bacteriostatic effects of hyaluronic acid.
AB  == background: this investigation is one of a series of projects seeking to ascertain whether hyaluronic acid (ha) is therapeutically effective in tissue regeneration procedures. the rationale for these investigations is to test the hypothesis that ha can serve as a bioabsorbable carrier for other substrates as well as itself actively promote the regeneration of tissue. methods: in this paper, we report on the bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties of 3 molecular weight formulations of recombinant ha (low, 141 kd; medium, 757 kd; and high, 1,300 kd) on selected oral and non-oral microorganisms in the planktonic phase. three concentrations of each ha formulation were screened, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/ml, using a standard broth culture assay. results: recombinant ha exerted varied bacteriostatic effects on all the bacterial strains tested depending on its molecular weight (mw) and concentration. the high concentrations of the medium mw ha had the greatest bacteriostatic effect, particularly on the actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella oris, staphylococcus aureus, and propionibacterium acnes strains. the 1.0 mg/ml concentration of high mw ha had the greatest overall bacteriostatic effect, inhibiting the growth of all 6 bacterial strains tested. among the bacterial strains studied, ha was found to have no bactericidal effects, regardless of concentration or molecular weight. conclusions: the results of this study suggest that ha in the mw range of 1,300 kd may prove beneficial in minimizing bacterial contamination of surgical wounds  when used in guided tissue regeneration surgery.

TI  == molecular analysis of microflora associated with dentoalveolar abscesses.
AB  == the microflora associated with three dentoalveolar abscesses was determined by cultural and molecular methods. 16s rrna genes were randomly amplified by means of conserved eubacterial primers and cloned. restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the clones and amplified genes encoding 16s rrna from the cultured bacteria was used to detect putative unculturable bacteria. clones representative of five predominant groups of uncultured organisms were sequenced. two were identified as porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella oris, and one was  found to be closely related to peptostreptococcus micros. the remaining two clones did not correspond to known, previously sequenced organisms. one was related to zoogloea ramigera, a species of aerobic waterborne organisms, while the other was distantly related to the genus prevotella. this study has demonstrated the possibility of the characterization of microflora associated with human infection by molecular methods without the inherent biases of culture.

TI  == evidence for the absence of hyaluronidase activity in porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to evaluate the ability of porphyromonas gingivalis to degrade hyaluronic acid. no hyaluronidase activity was detected using a turbidimetric method, whereas a standard plate assay showed a positive reaction for p. gingivalis. we postulated that the high proteolytic activity of p. gingivalis may account for this observation. a modified plate assay was designed to avoid false-positive reactions caused by proteolytic bacteria. the new assay, based on the formation of a water-insoluble salt between hyaluronic acid and the polyanion cetylpyridinium chloride, indicated that p. gingivalis does not have hyaluronidase activity. by this modified plate method, it was found that among 24 different oral bacterial species tested, propionibacterium acnes and prevotella oris were the only species that possess hyaluronidase activity.

TI  == identification of proteases from periodontopathogenic bacteria as activators of latent human neutrophil and fibroblast-type interstitial collagenases.
AB  == activation of latent human fibroblast-type and neutrophil interstitial procollagenases as well as degradation of native type i collagen by supra- and subgingival dental plaque extracts, an 80-kda trypsinlike protease from porphyromas gingivalis (atcc 33277), a 95-kda chymotrypsinlike protease from treponema denticola (atcc 29522), and selected bacterial species commonly isolated in periodontitis was studied. the bacteria included were prevotella intermedia (atcc 25261), prevotella buccae (es 57), prevotella oris (atcc 33573), porphyromonas endodontalis (es 54b), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (atcc 295222), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc 10953), mitsuokella dentalis (dsm 3688), and streptococcus mitis (atcc 15909). none of the bacteria activated latent procollagenases; however, both sub- and supragingival dental plaque extracts (neutral salt extraction) and proteases isolated from cell extracts from potentially periodontopathogenic bacteria p. gingivalis and t. denticola were found to activate latent human fibroblast-type and neutrophil interstitial procollagenases. the fibroblast-type interstitial collagenase was more efficiently activated by bacterial proteases than the neutrophil counterpart, which instead preferred nonproteolytic activation by the oxidative agent hypochlorous acid. the proteases were not able to convert collagenase tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (timp-1) complexes into active form or to change the ability of timp-1 to inhibit interstitial collagenase. none of the studied bacteria, proteases from p. gingivalis and t. denticola, or extracts of supra- and subgingival dental plaque showed any significant collagenolytic activity. however, the proteases degraded native and denatured collagen fragments after cleavage by interstitial collagenase and gelatinase. our results indicate that proteases from periodontopathogenic bacteria can act as direct proteolytic activators of human procollagenases and degrade collagen fragments. thus, in concert with host enzymes the bacterial proteases may participate in periodontal  tissue destruction.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == to assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7  gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. for comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against prevotella oralis, prevotella buccalis, prevotella bivia, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, bacteroides corporis, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium naviforme and propionibacterium acnes. prevotella oris, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and prevotella denticola, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides pneumosintes, and peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. strains of veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptostreptococcus magnus showed mics of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. the results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving bacteroides fragilis.
