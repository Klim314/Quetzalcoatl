TI  == microbiological characteristics of sepsis in a university hospital.
AB  == background: microbiological characteristics of sepsis and antimicrobial resistance are well studied, although in state university of campinas, no data has been published yet. methods: the main agents related to sepsis and antimicrobial resistance were analyzed. the blood culture records requested from  4,793 hospitalized patients were analyzed. the samples were processed using the bact/alert system for agent identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. results: a total of 1,017 patients met the inclusion criteria for a sepsis diagnosis, with 2,309 samples tested (2.27 samples/patient). there were 489 positive samples (21% positive) isolated from 337 patients (33.13%), but more rigorous criteria excluding potential contaminants resulted in analysis being restricted to 266 patients (315 agents). the prevalent microorganisms were coagulase negative staphylococcus (cns) (15.87%), escherichia coli (13.0%), staphylococcus aureus (11.7%), klebsiella pneumoniae (9.8%), enterobacter sp (9.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (9.2%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.7%) and candida sp (5.1%). examining antimicrobial resistance in the agents revealed that 51% of  the s. aureus isolates were methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and 80% of the cns isolates were oxacillin-resistant. for a. baumannii, the ideal profile drugs  were ampicillin sulbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam, and for p. aeruginosa, they were piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime. enterobacteria showed on average 32.5% and 35.7% resistance to beta-lactams and ciprofloxacin, respectively. when all gram-negative bacteria were considered, the resistance to  beta-lactams rose to 40.5%, and the resistance to ciprofloxacin rose to 42.3%. conclusions: eighty percent of the agents identified in blood cultures from patients with sepsis belonged to a group of eight different agents. for empirical treatment, carbapenems and vancomycin unfortunately still remain the best therapeutic choice, except for a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa, for which piperacillin/tazobactan is the best option.

TI  == [profile and susceptibility to antibiotics in urinary tract infections in children and newborns from 2012 to 2013: data from 1879 urine cultures].
AB  == introduction: we present recent data on the bacteriological profile and antibiotic susceptibility of uropathogenic bacteria isolated in children and newborns in our region over the past 2years. materials and methods: a retrospective study on the positive urine cultures from pediatric and neonatal populations during 2012-2013. bacteria were identified using conventional methods. susceptibility testing was performed and interpreted as recommended by the committee of the susceptibility of the french society of microbiology (ca-sfm). results: we collected 1879 non-redundant bacteria with more than 73% escherichia coli. children and infants (mean age, 32months [range, 1month to 14years]) accounted for 84% of the bacteria collected and newborns (mean age, 12days [range, 1day to 1month]) 16%. a female predominance was observed in the pediatric population (m:f sex ratio, 3.2), whereas for the neonatal population, the proportions were almost identical in both sexes (m:f sex ratio, 1.1). most of the positive urine cultures (n=1234) were from the community. hospitalized patients (n=636) were divided into pediatric (60%) and neonatal units (40%). five bacterial genera dominated the bacteriological profile: e. coli, klebsiella sp.,  proteus sp., enterobacter sp., and enterococcus. the susceptibility of the main bup antibiotics used for treatment of frequent uti showed the effectiveness of furadoine, imipenem, fosfomycin, and colistin. amoxicillin kept constant activity against enterococcus and streptococcus agalactiae. the rates of resistance of enterobacteriaceae to beta-lactam antibiotics were high, especially in the neonatal population. the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) was noted in 12.8% of pediatric enterobacteria vs. 22.6% of the neonatal strains. for community enterobacteriaceae, the activity of beta-lactam antibiotics was limited with 11.2% resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (c3g), including 8.6% esbl production. conclusion: the impact of widespread use of beta-lactam antibiotics in neonatal and pediatric environments is felt. colistin, imipenem, and fosfomycin are the most frequently used antibiotics active against bacteria responsible for neonatal and pediatric uti; however, they cannot be used as probabilistic treatment. nitrofurans seem to be active antibiotics on uti, but they present limits in their use in neonatal and pediatric populations. their indication in case of pyelonephritis should be discussed.

TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in seri kembangan, malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  == this study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around seri kembangan, a city in malaysia. pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of otus with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). proteobacteria, firmicutes and bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (otus) observed across all samples. the highest appearance frequencies (100%) were otus closely related to enterobacter sp., enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas sp. and pseudomonas putida. several otus were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including bacillus cereus, cronobacter sakazaki, cronobacter turisensis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, hafnia alvei, kurthia gibsonii, salmonella bongori, salmonella enterica, salmonella paratyphi, salmonella tyhpi, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. the condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.

TI  == extraction, characterization and antimicrobial activity of sulfated polysaccharides from fish skins.
AB  == sulfated polysaccharides were extracted from gray triggerfish (gtsp) and smooth hound (shsp) skins. their chemical and physical characteristics were determined using x-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopic analysis. the antibacterial activities of gtsp and shsp against listeria monocytogenes (atcc 43251), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), escherichia coli (atcc 25922), salmonella enterica (atcc 43972) and enterobacter  sp were evaluated by determining clear growth inhibition zone diameters and the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values and by essays in liquid media. gtsp and shsp were fractionated by a diethylaminoethyl-cellulose chromatography. fraction fgii, from gtsp, and fraction fsii, from shsp, showed the most important inhibitory effects against the tested bacterial species. the sulfated polysaccharides from fish skins did not show hemolytic activity towards bovine erythrocytes. overall, the results suggested that those polysaccharides could offer promising sources of polysaccharides for future application as dietary ingredients in the nutraceutical industry.

TI  == bacterial community structure associated with elective cesarean section versus vaginal delivery in chinese newborns.
AB  == objectives: increasing attention is being paid to the potential for cesarean birth to influence the taxa of the bacteria that compose the infant intestinal microbiota. the present study characterized the diversity of the intestinal microbiota in newborn infants delivered vaginally (vd) or by cesarean section (cd). methods: a cross-sectional study was performed using fecal specimens collected on days 2 and 4 of postnatal life from 25 vd infants and 16 cd infants. profiles of the fecal microbiota were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis in combination with 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene sequencing of the clones corresponding to the degenerating gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) bands. results: on days 2 and 4 of postnatal  life, vd and cd infants did not differ in the richness and evenness of the fecal  bacterial community; however, the taxa of the fecal microbiota were significantly different between the 2 groups. in vd infants, escherichia coli, bacteroides sp,  and bifidobacterium longum were the dominant microbes. in cd infants, staphylococcus sp, clostridium sp, enterobacter sp, and streptococcus sp were more common. conclusions: these results demonstrate that delivery method has a profound influence on the structure of the intestinal microbiota in chinese newborn infants. this is in accordance with data reported in other regions.

TI  == characterization of beta-lactamases in faecal enterobacteriaceae recovered from healthy humans in spain: focusing on ampc polymorphisms.
AB  == the intestinal tract is a huge reservoir of enterobacteriaceae, some of which are opportunist pathogens. several genera of these bacteria harbour intrinsic antibiotic resistance genes, such as ampc genes in species of citrobacter, enterobacter or escherichia genera. in this work, beta-lactamases and other resistance mechanisms have been characterized in enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from healthy human faecal samples, focusing on the ampc beta-lactamase  genes. fifty human faecal samples were obtained, and 70 enterobacteriaceae bacteria were isolated: 44 escherichia coli, 4 citrobacter braakii, 9 citrobacter freundii, 8 enterobacter cloacae, 1 proteus mirabilis, 1 proteus vulgaris, 1 klebsiella oxytoca, 1 serratia sp. and 1 cronobacter sp. a high percentage of resistance to ampicillin was detected (57 %), observing the ampc phenotype in 22  isolates (31 %) and the esbl phenotype in 3 isolates. ampc molecular characterization showed high diversity into bla cmy and bla act genes from citrobacter and enterobacter species, respectively, and the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) analysis demonstrated low clonality among them. the prevalence of people colonized by strains carrying plasmid-mediated ampc genes obtained in this study was 2 %. the unique plasmid-mediated bla ampc identified in this study was the bla cmy-2 gene, detected in an e. coli isolate ascribed to  the sequence type st405 which belonged to phylogenetic group d. the hybridization and conjugation experiments demonstrated that the isecp1-bla cmy-2-blc structure  was carried by a ~78-kb self-transferable inck plasmid. this study shows a high polymorphism among beta-lactamase genes in enterobacteriaceae from healthy people microbiota. extensive ampc-carrier studies would provide important information and could allow the anticipation of future global health problems.

TI  == microbial evaluation of sandboxes located in urban area.
AB  == this paper presents the results of a study on the degree of bacteriological pollution of sandboxes situated in fenced and unfenced housing estates located in an urban area in olsztyn, poland. heterotrophic plate counts (hpc22, hpc37), enterobacteriaceae, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., staphylococcus spp. and  clostridium perfringens determined by cultivation and fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) methods were used as indicators of the sanitary state. their maximum number in the sand samples reached values of up to 5.4x10(7), 2.6x10(6),  3.3x10(4), 2.1x10(3), 1.8x10(4), 1.9x10(1) and 1.2x10(4)cfu/g, respectively. it was found that values of culture-independent method were two-four orders greater  than those obtained by the cultivation method. among identified enterobacteriaceae, pantoea spp. and enterobacter cloacae were the most numerous, whereas escherichia cells were detected only occasionally. pathogenic bacteria of the genus salmonella sp. were isolated from sandboxes also when e. coli were absent. bacteria from staphylococcus genus were isolated irrespective of the site and time of sampling. additionally, the presence of molds and yeasts was studied. maximum counts of these microorganisms amounted to 1.0x10(5) and to 3.5x10(4)cfu/g. aspergillus, penicillium, alternaria and trichoderma genera were  most numerous among molds, whereas trichosporon was detected most frequently among yeasts. sandboxes in the fenced housing estate and those located in the area which is not close to trees were less polluted than the sand collected from  sandboxes in the unfenced housing estate. potentially pathogenic bacteria of the  genus salmonella spp. were identified in analyzed sandboxes, also when toxocara and e. coli were absent. it seems that assessing the contamination of children's  play areas basing only on fecal bacteria counts and by monitoring number of parasites' eggs may be insufficient to evaluate microbial pollution of sandboxes  and may not fully reflect their safety for children.

TI  == chemical composition of essential oil from ripe fruit of schinus terebinthifolius raddi and evaluation of its activity against wild strains of hospital origin.
AB  == the essential oil (eo) composition of ripe fruit of s. terebinthifolius raddi was analyzed by gc-ms. the oil extraction yielded 6.54 +/- 1.06% (w/w). seventeen compounds were identified, accounting for 91.15% of the total oil, where monoterpenes constituted the main chemical class (85.81%), followed by sesquiterpenes (5.34%). the major monoterpene identified was delta-3-carene (30.37%), followed by limonene (17.44%), alpha-phellandrene (12.60%) and alpha-pinene (12.59%). trans-caryophyllene (1.77%) was the major sesquiterpene identified. the antibacterial activity of the essential oil was evaluated against wild strains of hospital origin (escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp., klebsiella oxytoca, corynebacterium sp., staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter sp., enterobacter agglomerans, bacillus sp., nocardia sp. and streptococcus group d).  the essential oil of the ripe fruit of s. terebinthifolius raddi has shown to be  active against all tested wild strains, with minimum inhibitory concentration ranging from 3.55 mug/ml to 56.86 mug/ml. however, it has revealed some differences in susceptibility: the general, gram-positive species showed greater  sensitivity to the action of eo, which is probably due to the lower structural complexity of their cell walls.

TI  == purification of a secreted lectin from andrias davidianus skin and its antibacterial activity.
AB  == a lectin secreted from andrias davidianus skin (adl) was purified by affinity chromatography on porcine stomach mucin (type iii) (psm)-crosslinked albumin, followed by gel filtration on sephadex g-100 and hplc on tsk gel g3000pwxl. the purified lectin was found to be a dimeric protein, as revealed by sds-page and maldi-tof analysis. sds-page showed that the adl protein had a molecular mass of  17 kda. adl produced an 8.5 kda band when examined using sds-page under reducing  conditions. adl agglutinated native and trypsinized human b erythrocytes. the hemagglutination activity was inhibited by glycoproteins, such as psm and asialo-psm, but not by any of the monosaccharides tested. the activity was stable between 4 degrees c and 50 degrees c. significant adl activity was observed between ph 4-5. the lectin reaction did not depend on the presence of the divalent cation ca2+ or mg2+. the n-terminal adl sequence was determined to be vgytvgatpm. the lectin exhibited antibacterial activity, involving growth and respiration inhibition in escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and shewanella sp. furthermore, adl showed inhibition activity against the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. these findings suggest that adl plays an important role in the innate immunity of a. davidianus on the body surface.

TI  == generation of enterobacter sp. ysu auxotrophs using transposon mutagenesis.
AB  == prototrophic bacteria grow on m-9 minimal salts medium supplemented with glucose  (m-9 medium), which is used as a carbon and energy source. auxotrophs can be generated using a transposome. the commercially available, tn5-derived transposome used in this protocol consists of a linear segment of dna containing  an r6kgamma replication origin, a gene for kanamycin resistance and two mosaic sequence ends, which serve as transposase binding sites. the transposome, provided as a dna/transposase protein complex, is introduced by electroporation into the prototrophic strain, enterobacter sp. ysu, and randomly incorporates itself into this host's genome. transformants are replica plated onto luria-bertani agar plates containing kanamycin, (lb-kan) and onto m-9 medium agar plates containing kanamycin (m-9-kan). the transformants that grow on lb-kan plates but not on m-9-kan plates are considered to be auxotrophs. purified genomic dna from an auxotroph is partially digested, ligated and transformed into a pir+ escherichia coli (e. coli) strain. the r6kgamma replication origin allows  the plasmid to replicate in pir+ e. coli strains, and the kanamycin resistance marker allows for plasmid selection. each transformant possesses a new plasmid containing the transposon flanked by the interrupted chromosomal region. sanger sequencing and the basic local alignment search tool (blast) suggest a putative identity of the interrupted gene. there are three advantages to using this transposome mutagenesis strategy. first, it does not rely on the expression of a  transposase gene by the host. second, the transposome is introduced into the target host by electroporation, rather than by conjugation or by transduction and therefore is more efficient. third, the r6kgamma replication origin makes it easy to identify the mutated gene which is partially recovered in a recombinant plasmid. this technique can be used to investigate the genes involved in other characteristics of enterobacter sp. ysu or of a wider variety of bacterial strains.

TI  == entericidin is required for a probiotic treatment (enterobacter sp. strain c6-6)  to protect trout from cold-water disease challenge.
AB  == flavobacterium psychrophilum causes bacterial cold-water disease in multiple fish species, including salmonids. an autochthonous enterobacter strain (c6-6) inhibits the in vitro growth of f. psychrophilum, and when ingested as a putative probiotic, it provides protection against injection challenge with f. psychrophilum in rainbow trout. in this study, low-molecular-mass (</=3 kda) fractions from both enterobacter c6-6 and escherichia coli k-12 culture supernatants inhibited the growth of f. psychrophilum. the </=3-kda fraction from enterobacter c6-6 was analyzed by sds-page, and subsequent tandem mass spectroscopy identified ecnb, which is a small membrane lipoprotein that is a putative pore-forming toxin. agar plate diffusion assays demonstrated that ecnab  knockout strains of both enterobacter c6-6 and e. coli k-12 no longer inhibited f. psychrophilum (p < 0.001), while ecnab-complemented knockout strains recovered the inhibitory phenotype (p < 0.001). in fish experiments, the engineered strains (c6-6 deltaecnab and c6-6 deltaecnab<pet101::ecnab>) and the wild-type strain (c6-6) were added to the fish diet every day for 38 days. on day 11, the fish were challenged by injection with a virulent strain of f. psychrophilum (csf 259-93). fish that were fed c6-6 had significantly longer survival than fish fed  the ecnab knockout strain (p < 0.0001), while fish fed the complemented knockout  strain recovered the probiotic phenotype (p = 0.61). this entericidin is responsible for the probiotic activity of enterobacter c6-6, and it may present new opportunities for therapeutic and prophylactic treatments against similarly susceptible pathogens.

TI  == rational design of k173a substitution enhances thermostability coupled with catalytic activity of enterobacter sp. bn12 lipase.
AB  == elbn12 is a lipase isolated from enterobacter sp. bn12 with potential application in biotechnology. homology modeling and rational design were applied to improve thermal stability of the lipase. k173a substitution introduced an axxxa motif on  the lipase model and it may have role in dimerization and thermostability of the  protein. site-directed mutagenesis was performed to construct the lipase variant. the mutated lipase was expressed in escherichia coli plyss and partially purified. thermostability of the mutated lipase after 1 h of incubation at 70 degrees c was twice that of wild-type lipase under the same conditions. catalytic activity of the variant was about 1.5-fold towards tricaprylin at 60 degrees c and ph 8.0; moreover, the lipase variant preserved its stability within the ph range of 7.0-11.0. substitution of superficial hydrophilic lys with hydrophobic ala residue increased stability of the mutated lipase in the presence of nonionic surfactants, but this substitution caused lower stability towards polar solvents. analysis of circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that the k173a mutation altered the secondary structure of the lipase into a more helical one. in conclusion, results of this study demonstrate the positive role of generation of  a stabilizing protein motif through rational protein engineering that improves the enzyme characteristics.

TI  == cloning and characterization of newly isolated lipase from enterobacter sp. bn12.
AB  == a mesophilic enterobacter sp. bn12 producing an alkaline thermostable lipase was  isolated from soil in tehran, iran. the lipase gene (elbn12) was identified from  a genomic library. sequence analysis of the dna fragment revealed an open reading frame of 879 bp encoding a lipase with a molecular mass of 31.3 kda. the deduced  amino acid sequence showed 96% identity with a lipase of enterobacter sp. ag1 and the identity of their dna sequences was 88.9%. elbn12 belongs to the lipase subfamily i.1 and its catalytic triad consists of ser82, asp237 and his259. the lipase was expressed in escherichia coli (bl21) plyss and partially purified by anion exchange chromatography. the maximum activity of elbn12 was obtained at temperature of 60 degrees c and ph 8.0 towards tricaprylin (c8) and its specific  activity was around 2900 u/mg. elbn12 was stable within a broad ph range from 6.0 to 11.0. the enzyme showed high stability in both polar and nonpolar organic solvents at 50% (v/v). the lipase activity was enhanced in the presence of 10 mm  of ca(2+), mg(2+) and k(+), while heavy metals (fe(3+) and zn(2+)) had strong inhibitory effect. elbn12 showed high activity in the presence of 1% (w/v) nonionic surfactants, however ionic surfactants inhibited the lipolytic activity. elbn12 characteristics show that it has a potential to be used in various industrial processes.

TI  == causes, diagnosis and therapy of common diseases in neonatal puppies in the first days of life: cornerstones of practical approach.
AB  == neonatal diseases and losses are a common and often unavoidable problem within breeding kennels. altogether, morbidity and mortality ranges, according to the literature, from 5 to 35%. among non-infectious causes besides hypoxia during birth, hypothermia, hypoglycaemia and dehydration are mostly responsible for puppy diseases and losses. approximately 90% of all deaths in hypoxaemic pups occur during the first 2 days. of 183 pups with hypoxia, 63 died, 92.7% of them within 48 h after birth. among infectious causes, bacterial infection is the most common cause of neonatal mortality. escherichia coli, streptococci, staphylococci, pseudomonas sp., klebsiella sp., enterobacter sp. and some other micro-organisms are regularly involved in neonatal infections. post-mortem findings especially document e. coli, staphylococcus sp. and streptococcus sp. as responsible bacteria. the dam and the environment are suspected as sources of neonatal infections as it was shown by genetic relatedness of responsible bacterial strains isolated in both puppies and their dams. from a total of 517 puppies with bacterial infections, the treatment results documented that parenteral administration of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in 308 neonates showed the best result. diagnosis of diseases is often made difficult by the absence of  variability in clinical signs contrary to adult dogs. findings during a physical  examination in pups differ from those in adults. furthermore, treatment recommendations have to meet the special conditions in neonates concerning drug metabolism and excretion.

TI  == molecular detection of esbls production and antibiotic resistance patterns in gram negative bacilli isolated from urinary tract infections.
AB  == background: beta-lactam resistance is more prevalent in gram negative bacterial isolates worldwide, particularly in developing countries. in order to provide data relating to antibiotic therapy and resistance control, routine monitoring of corresponding antibiotic resistance genes is necessary. aims: the aim of this study was the characterization of beta-lactam resistance genes and its plasmid profile in bacteria isolated from urinary tract infection samples. materials and  methods: in this study, 298 gram negative bacteria isolated from 6739 urine specimens were identified by biochemical standard tests. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the disk diffusion method. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strains were also detected by the double-disk synergy test. the presence of blatem and blashv genes in the strains studied was ascertained by polymerase chain reaction. results: of all gram negative bacteria, escherichia coli (69.1%) was the most common strain, followed by klebsiella sp. (12.1%), enterobacter sp. (8.4%), proteus sp. (4.4%),  citrobacter (4%) and pseudomonas sp. (2%). the most antibiotic resistance was shown to tetracycline (95.16%), nalidixic acid (89.78%) and gentamycin (73.20%) antibiotics. among all the strains tested, 35 isolates (11.75%) expressed esbl activity. the prevalence of tem and shv positivity among these isolates was 34.29%, followed by tem (31.43%), tem and shv negativity (20.0%) and shv (14.29%), respectively. conclusions: regular monitoring of antimicrobial drug resistance seems necessary to improve our guidelines in the use of the empirical  antibiotic therapy.

TI  == freshwater-borne bacteria isolated from a malaysian rainforest waterfall exhibiting quorum sensing properties.
AB  == one obvious requirement for concerted action by a bacterial population is for an  individual to be aware of and respond to the other individuals of the same species in order to form a response in unison. the term "quorum sensing" (qs) was coined to describe bacterial communication that is able to stimulate expression of a series of genes when the concentration of the signaling molecules has reached a threshold level. here we report the isolation from aquatic environment  of a bacterium that was later identified as enterobacter sp.. chromobacterium violaceum cv026 and escherichia coli [psb401] were used for preliminary screening of n-acyl homoserine lactone (ahl) production. the enterobacter sp. isolated was  shown to produce two types of ahls as confirmed by analysis using high resolution tandem mass spectrometry. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first documentation of an enterobacter sp. that produced both 3-oxo-c6-hsl and 3-oxo-c8-hsl as qs signaling molecules.

TI  == study of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus strains as probiotics on multi drug resistant (mdr) bacteria isolated from urinary tract infections (utis).
AB  == objective(s): urinary tract infection (uti) caused by bacteria is one of the most frequent infections in human population. inappropriate use of antibiotics, often  leads to appearance of drug resistance in bacteria. however, use of probiotic bacteria has been suggested as a partial replacement. this study was aimed to assess the antagonistic effects of lactobacillus standard strains against bacteria isolated from uti infections. materials and methods: among 600 samples;  those with >/=10,000 cfu/ml were selected as uti positive samples. enterococcus sp., klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., and escherichia coli were found the most prevalent uti causative agents. all isolates were screened for multi drug resistance and subjected to the antimicrobial effects of three lactobacillus strains by using microplate technique and the mics amounts were determined. in order to verify the origin of antibiotic resistance of isolates, plasmid curing using ethidium bromide and acridine orange was carried out. results: no antagonistic activity in lactobacilli suspension was detected against test on enterococcus and enterobacter strains and k. pneumoniae, which were resistant to  most antibiotics. however, an inhibitory effect was observed for e. coli which were resistant to 8-9 antibiotics. in addition, l. casei was determined to be the most effective probiotic. results from replica plating suggested one of the plasmids could be related to the gene responsible for ampicillin resistance. conclusion: treatment of e. coli with probiotic suspension was not effective on inhibition of the plasmid carrying hypothetical ampicillin resistant gene. moreover, the plasmid profiles obtained from probiotic-treated isolates were identical to untreated isolates.

TI  == health evaluation and survey of zoonotic pathogens in free-ranging capybaras (hydrochoerus hydrochaeris).
AB  == capybaras (hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) are the world's largest rodents and play an epidemiologic role in the transmission of zoonotic pathogens, including the causative agents of brazilian spotted fever, leptospirosis, and others. we surveyed the health of 31 free-ranging capybaras at the alberto lofgren state park, sao paulo, brazil using a variety of diagnostic methods. hematology and serum chemistry were consistent with mild malnutrition and parasitism but did not indicate severe physiologic imbalance or disease. all animals were serologically  negative for rickettsia rickettsii, leishmania spp., and trypanosoma sp., but antibodies against rabies virus (71%), leptospira sp. (26%), and toxoplasma sp. (23%) were detected. salmonella sp. was not cultured from fecal samples. frequently cultured enterobacteria included escherichia coli (61%), enterococcus  casseiflavus (35%), enterococcus faecalis (35%), enterobacter aerogenes (32%), klebisella pneumoniae (32%), and serratia marcescens (32%). no potentially pathogenic fungi were cultured from hair samples. fecal parasitology revealed infection by protozoophaga sp. (58%), viannella spp. (23%), strongyloides spp. (10%), and ancilostomatidae (10%). a total of 218 ticks was retrieved from the animals: amblyomma sp. larvae and nymphs (43%), a. dubitatum adults (52%), and a. cajennense adults (5%). the capybaras were free from most potentially zoonotic pathogens evaluated; however, the presence of amblyomma spp. ticks (potential vectors of rickettsia spp.) and indirect evidence of exposure to the rabies virus, leptospira sp., and toxoplasma sp. warrant the maintenance of public health programs and wildlife health monitoring.

TI  == de-novo synthesis of 2-phenylethanol by enterobacter sp. cgmcc 5087.
AB  == background: 2-phenylethanl (2-pe) and its derivatives are important chemicals, which are widely used in food materials and fine chemical industries and polymers and it's also a potentially valuable alcohol for next-generation biofuel. however, the biosynthesis of 2-pe are mainly biotransformed from phenylalanine, the price of which barred the production. therefore, it is necessary to seek more sustainable technologies for 2-pe production. results: a new strain which produces 2-pe through the phenylpyruvate pathway was isolated and identified as enterobacter sp. cgmcc 5087. the strain is able to use renewable monosaccharide as the carbon source and nh4cl as the nitrogen source to produce 2-pe. two genes  of rate-limiting enzymes, chorismate mutase p-prephenate dehydratase (phea) and 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate synthase (dahp), were cloned from escherichia coli and overexpressed in e. sp. cgmcc 5087. the engineered e. sp. cgmcc 5087 produces 334.9 mg l(-)(1) 2-pe in 12 h, which is 3.26 times as high as the wild strain. conclusions: the phenylpyruvate pathway and the substrate specificity of 2-keto-acid decarboxylase towards phenylpyruvate were found in e.  sp. cgmcc 5087. combined with the low-cost monosaccharide as the substrate, the finding provides a novel and potential way for 2-pe production.

TI  == functional characterization of the sucrose isomerase responsible for trehalulose  production in plant-associated pectobacterium species.
AB  == fifty-three plant-associated microorganisms were investigated for their ability to convert sucrose to its isomers. these microorganisms included one dickeya zeae isolate and 7 enterobacter, 3 pantoea, and 43 pectobacterium species. eleven out  of the 53 strains (21%) showed the ability to transform sucrose to isomaltulose and trehalulose. among those, pectobacterium carotovorum kkh 3-1 showed the highest bioconversion yield (97.4%) from sucrose to its isomers. in this strain,  the addition of up to 14% sucrose in the medium enhanced sucrose isomerase (siase) production. the siase activity at 14% sucrose (47.6 u/mg dcw) was about 3.6-fold higher than that of the negative control (13.3 u/mg dcw at 0% sucrose).  the gene encoding siase, which is comprised a 1776 bp open reading frame (orf) encoding 591 amino acids, was cloned from p. carotovorum kkh 3-1 and expressed in escherichia coli. the recombinant siase (pcsi) was shown to have optimum activity at ph 6.0 and 40 degrees c. the reaction temperature significantly affected the ratio of sucrose isomers produced by pcsi. the amount of trehalulose increased from 47.5% to 79.1% as temperature was lowered from 50 degrees c to 30 degrees c, implying that siase activity can be controlled by reaction temperature.

TI  == emergence of new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (ndm-1) producing and multidrug resistant uropathogens causing urinary tract infections in andaman islands, india.
AB  == the present study was undertaken to understand the distribution and the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the uropathogens in the remote islands of india. patients' demographical data, urine culture results, and resistance rates were analyzed and multidrug resistant isolates were characterized. significant bacteriuria was found in 16 (17.7%, 95% confidence interval [ci] 8.47-23.53%) samples, which includes escherichia coli 9 (56.3%); klebsiella pneumoniae 3 (18.8%); enterobacter sp. 2 (12.5%) and proteus mirabilis 2 (12.5%). the uropathogens showed a wide resistance involving 3-21 drugs with 15 different  resistance patterns. among the 16 isolates, 13 (81.3%, 95% ci 62.13-100.37%) and  11 (68.8%, 95% ci 46.04-91.46%) isolates were resistant to fluoroquinolones and third generation cephalosporins, respectively. multiple mutations were detected in quinolone resistance determining region (qrdr) of the fluoroquinolone resistant isolates and all third generation cephalosporin resistant isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. a total of 7 (44%, 95% ci 17.02-70.98%) isolates was found to harbor plasmid mediated quinolone resistance  determinants the present study reports for the first time the presence of the new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (ndm-1) gene in two isolates of p. mirabilis in these islands. detection of multidrug resistant and ndm-1 producing isolates from cases of urinary tract infection in these remote islands lends support to the belief that the existence of these highly resistant strains is perhaps more widespread than previously thought and underscores the need for immediate implementation of antibiotic policy integrated with a continuous surveillance system. the study strengthens the need for a continuous surveillance system of antibiotic resistance in these remote islands.

TI  == purification and characterization of a gh43 beta-xylosidase from enterobacter sp. identified and cloned from forest soil bacteria.
AB  == the use of lignocellulosic biomass for second generation biofuels requires optimization of enzymatic breakdown of plant cell walls. in this work, cellulolytic bacteria were isolated from a native and two cultivated forest soil  samples. amplification of glycosyl hydrolases was attempted by using a low stringency-degenerate primer pcr strategy, using total soil dna and bulk dna pooled from positive colonies as template. a set of primers was designed based on acidothermus cellulolyticus genome, by search of conserved domains of glycosyl hydrolases (gh) families of interest. using this approach, a fragment containing  an open reading frame (orf) with 98% identity to a putative gh43 beta-xylosidase  coding gene from enterobacter cloacae was amplified and cloned. the full protein  was expressed in escherichia coli as n-terminal or c-terminal his-tagged fusions  and purified under native conditions. only n-terminal fusion protein, his-xyl43,  presented beta-xylosidase activity. on pnpx, optimal activity was achieved at ph  6 and 40 degrees c and km and kcat values were 2.92 mm and 1.32 seg(-1), respectively. activity was also demonstrated on xylobiose (x2), with km 17.8 mm and kcat 380 s(-1). these results demonstrated that xyl43 is a functional beta-xylosidase and it is the first evidence of this activity for enterobacter sp.

TI  == characterization of a heavy metal translocating p-type atpase gene from an environmental heavy metal resistance enterobacter sp. isolate.
AB  == heavy metals are common contaminants found in polluted areas. we have identified  a heavy metal translocating p-type atpase gene (hmtp) via fosmid library and in vitro transposon mutagenesis from an enterobacter sp. isolate. this gene is believed to participate in the bacterium's heavy metal resistance traits. the complete gene was identified, cloned, and expressed in a suitable escherichia coli host cell. e. coli w3110, rw3110 (znta::km), gg48 (deltazitb::cm znta::km),  and gg51 (deltazitb::cm) were used to study the possible effects of this gene for heavy metal (cadmium and zinc in particular) resistance. among the e. coli strains tested, rw3110 and gg48 showed more sensitivity to cadmium and zinc compared to the wild-type e. coli w3110 and strain gg51. therefore, strains rw3110 and gg48 were chosen for the reference hosts for further evaluation of the gene's effect. the results showed that expression of this heavy metal translocating p-type atpase gene could increase the ability for zinc and cadmium  resistance in the tested microorganisms.

TI  == diversity of the bacterial and fungal microflora from the midgut and cuticle of phlebotomine sand flies collected in north-western iran.
AB  == background: phlebotomine sand flies are the vectors of the leishmaniases, parasitic diseases caused by leishmania spp. little is known about the prevalence and diversity of sand fly microflora colonizing the midgut or the cuticle. particularly, there is little information on the fungal diversity. this information is important for development of vector control strategies. methodology/principal findings: five sand fly species: phlebotomus papatasi, p. sergenti, p. kandelakii, p. perfiliewi and p. halepensis were caught in bileh savar and kaleybar in north-western iran that are located in endemic foci of visceral leishmaniasis. a total of 35 specimens were processed. bacterial and fungal strains were identified by routine microbiological methods. we characterized 39 fungal isolates from the cuticle and/or the midgut. they belong  to six different genera including penicillium (17 isolates), aspergillus (14), acremonium (5), fusarium (1), geotrichum (1) and candida (1). we identified 33 gram-negative bacteria: serratia marcescens (9 isolates), enterobacter cloacae (6), pseudomonas fluorescens (6), klebsiella ozaenae (4), acinetobacter sp. (3),  escherichia coli (3), asaia sp. (1) and pantoea sp. (1) as well as gram-positive  bacteria bacillus subtilis (5) and micrococcus luteus (5) in 10 isolates. conclusion/significance: our study provides new data on the microbiotic diversity of field-collected sand flies and for the first time, evidence of the presence of asaia sp. in sand flies. we have also found a link between physiological stages (unfed, fresh fed, semi gravid and gravid) of sand flies and number of bacteria that they carry. interestingly pantoea sp. and klebsiella ozaenae have been isolated in old world sand fly species. the presence of latter species on sand fly cuticle and in the female midgut suggests a role for this arthropod in dissemination of these pathogenic bacteria in endemic areas. further experiments  are required to clearly delineate the vectorial role (passive or active) of sand  flies.

TI  == biochemical basis of mercury remediation and bioaccumulation by enterobacter sp.  emb21.
AB  == the aims of this study were to isolate metal bioaccumulating bacterial strains and to study their applications in removal of environmental problematic heavy metals like mercury. five bacterial strains belonging to genera enterobacter, bacillus, and pseudomonas were isolated from oil-spilled soil. among these, one of the strains enterobacter sp. emb21 showed mercury bioaccumulation inside the cells simultaneous to its bioremediation. the bioaccumulation of remediated mercury was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray. the mercury-resistant loci in the enterobacter sp. emb21 cells were plasmid-mediated as confirmed by transformation of mercury-sensitive escherichia  coli dh5alpha by enterobacter sp. emb21 plasmid. effect of different culture parameters viz-a-viz inoculum size, ph, carbon, and nitrogen source revealed that alkaline ph and presence of dextrose and yeast extract favored better remediation. the results indicated the usefulness of enterobacter sp. emb21 for the effective remediation of mercury in bioaccumulated form. the enterobacter sp. emb21 seems promising for heavy metal remediation wherein the remediated metal can be trapped inside the cells. the process can further be developed for the synthesis of valuable high-end functional alloy, nanoparticles, or metal conjugates from the metal being remediated.

AB  == background: zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (zcl) is a polymorphic disease. it is generally accepted that bacterial superinfection may play a role in the clinical appearance of the lesions and may delay or prevent the healing process.  however, the pattern of bacterial pathogens involved has rarely been investigated. material/methods: the aim of this study was to identify the bacterial species contaminating the suspected zcl and their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics. microscopic examination of stained smears and cultures were used to differentiate zcl from non-zcl lesions in a rural area north of isfahan, iran from july to december 2009. bacteria were isolated from the lesions and identified and antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard microbiological techniques. results: the results show that 602 (68%) of 855 patients were positive for zcl, of which 83.4% with volcano-shape, 8.8% psoriasiform, 6.6% popular form and 1.2% with other atypical forms of zcl. the bacteria were isolated from 66.8% of zcl (70% of volcano-shape, 60% of psoriasiform and 25% of popular form) and 64.7% of non-zcl lesions. the most common species were staphylococcus aureus (41.7%) and s. epidermidis (28%) followed by bacillus sp. streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., proteus sp., enterobacter sp. and pseudomonas aeroginosa. ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, cefazolin and clindamycin were the most effective antibiotics. conclusions: bacterial superinfection appears to be very common in zcl, but its prevalence is not different from that of non-zcl lesions and it has little effect on the clinical appearance of anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (acl). local  lesion care and management of bacterial superinfection must be considered in the  treatment of zcl.

TI  == in vivo-validated essential genes identified in acinetobacter baumannii by using  human ascites overlap poorly with essential genes detected on laboratory media.
AB  == a critical feature of a potential antimicrobial target is the characteristic of being essential for growth and survival during host infection. for bacteria, genome-wide essentiality screens are usually performed on rich laboratory media.  this study addressed whether genes detected in that manner were optimal for the identification of antimicrobial targets since the in vivo milieu is fundamentally different. mutant derivatives of a clinical isolate of acinetobacter baumannii were screened for growth on human ascites, an ex vivo medium that reflects the infection environment. a subset of 34 mutants with unique gene disruptions that demonstrated little to no growth on ascites underwent evaluation in a rat subcutaneous abscess model, establishing 18 (53%) of these genes as in vivo essential. the putative gene products all had annotated biological functions, represented unrecognized or underexploited antimicrobial targets, and could be grouped into five functional categories: metabolic, two-component signaling systems, dna/rna synthesis and regulation, protein transport, and structural. these a. baumannii in vivo essential genes overlapped poorly with the sets of essential genes from other gram-negative bacteria catalogued in the database of essential genes (deg), including those of acinetobacter baylyi, a closely related species. however, this finding was not due to the absence of orthologs. none of the 18 in vivo essential genes identified in this study, or their putative gene products, were targets of fda-approved drugs or drugs in the developmental pipeline, indicating that a significant portion of the available target space within pathogenic gram-negative bacteria is currently neglected. importance: the  human pathogen acinetobacter baumannii is of increasing clinical importance, and  a growing proportion of isolates are multiantimicrobial-resistant, pan-antimicrobial-resistant, or extremely resistant strains. this scenario is reflective of the general problem of a critical lack of antimicrobials effective  against antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative bacteria, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., and escherichia coli. this study identified a set of a. baumannii genes that are essential for growth and survival during infection and demonstrated the importance of using clinically relevant media and in vivo validation while screening for essential genes for the purpose of developing new antimicrobials. furthermore, it established that if a gene is absent from the database of essential genes, it should not be excluded as a potential antimicrobial target. lastly, a new set of high-value potential antimicrobial targets for pathogenic gram-negative bacteria has been identified.

TI  == nonrecovery of varying proportions of viable bacteria during spread plating governed by the extent of spreader usage and proposal for an alternate spotting-spreading approach to maximize the cfu.
AB  == aims: to elucidate the cause of high variations and inconsistencies in bacterial  cfu observed within and between different experiments while assessing viable bacterial counts through spread plating (sp). methods and results: following the  inconsistent results, cfu estimations were undertaken through conventional sp using the spreader, or a modified approach that did not use spreader employing four organisms. the latter approach involving spotting-and-tilt-spreading of inoculum on agar surface [spotting spreading (ss)] yielded higher cfu by 11-120%  over the weighted average depending on the organism and diluent. the adverse effect owing to the spreader was the most obvious in escherichia coli followed by staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter cloacae and bacillus pumilus. plate attributes that determined the surface moisture levels of agar medium and the spreading practice adopted by the personnel formed two other major influencing factors. plating for shorter periods (<60 s) using fresh 15/20 ml plates caused loss of 3-12% cfu owing to inoculum adhesion to spreader irrespective of glass or polypropylene make. on the other hand, prolonging the plating brought down the cfu significantly. spreader movement on agar surface subsequent to the exhaustion of free moisture, which was marked by the experiencing of some friction to smooth spreader movement, was detrimental to vegetative cells, while bacillus spores were less affected. conclusions: the study brings out that the way sp is carried  out exerts significant effects on cfu influenced by plate conditions. prolonged use of spreader on dry agar surface could be highly detrimental to bacterial cells. a mild use of spreader accounting for spreader-adhering inoculum or the practice of ss not involving the spreader is recommended. significance and impact of the study: this study unravels the effects owing to the spreader on bacterial  cells and the cfu and recommends an alternate approach of ss to minimize cfu inconsistencies and to maximize the viable bacterial counts.

TI  == phyto-synthesis of silver nanoscale particles using morinda citrifolia l. and its inhibitory activity against human pathogens.
AB  == leaf extract of morinda citrifolia l. was assessed for the synthesis of silver nanoscale particles under different temperature and reaction time. synthesized nanoscale (mcagnps) particles were confirmed by analysing the excitation of surface plasmon resonance (spr) using uv-visible spectrophotometer at 420 nm. further sem, hrtem analysis confirmed the range of particle size between 10 and 60 nm and sead pattern authorizes the face centered cubic (fcc) crystalline nature of the mcagnps. fourier transform infrared spectrum (ftir) of synthesized  mcagnps confirms the presence of high amount of phenolic compounds in the plant extract which may possibly influence the reduction process and stabilization of nanoparticles. further, inhibitory activity of mcagnps and plant extract were tested against human pathogens like eschericia coli, pseudomonas aeroginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, bacillus cereus and enterococci sp. the results indicated that the mcagnps showed moderate inhibitory actions against human pathogens than crude plant extract, demonstrating its antimicrobial value against pathogenic diseases.

TI  == broad diversity of conjugative plasmids in integron-carrying bacteria from wastewater environments.
AB  == in this study we assessed the occurrence, diversity and conjugative potential of  plasmids in integron-carrying aeromonas and enterobacteriaceae from wastewaters.  sixty-six strains were included as donors in mating assays using rifampicin-resistant escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida recipient strains. the diversity of plasmids from donors and transconjugants (resistant to tetracycline or streptomycin) was evaluated by restriction analysis and replicon  typing targeting 19 incompatibility groups. restriction patterns revealed a diverse plasmid pool present in these strains. plasmids were assigned to frepb (aeromonas salmonicida, aeromonas veronii, aeromonas sp., e. coli, enterobacter sp.), fic (a. salmonicida, aeromonas sp.), fia (shigella sp.), i1 (a. veronii, aeromonas sp., e. coli), hi1 (e. coli) and u (aeromonas media) replicons. nevertheless, 50% of the plasmids could not be assigned to any replicon type. among integron-positive transconjugants, frepb, i1 and hi1 replicons were detected. results showed that wastewaters enclose a rich plasmid pool associated  with integron-carrying bacteria, capable of conjugating to different bacterial hosts. moreover, replicons detected in this study in aeromonas strains expand our current knowledge of plasmid diversity in this genus.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility to isepamicin of 6,296 enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates collected at a tertiary care university hospital in greece.
AB  == the reevaluation of "forgotten" antibiotics can identify new therapeutic options  against extensively drug-resistant gram-negative pathogens. we sought to investigate isepamicin in this regard. we retrospectively evaluated the antimicrobial susceptibility to isepamicin of enterobacteriaceae sp. isolates from unique patients, collected at the microbiological laboratory of the university hospital of heraklion, crete, greece, from 2004 to 2009. susceptibility testing was done with the automated vitek 2 system. the breakpoints for susceptibility to isepamicin, tigecycline, and other antibiotics  were those proposed by the comite de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiologie (ca-sfm), the fda, and the clsi, respectively. a total of 6,296 isolates were studied, including primarily 3,401 (54.0%) escherichia coli, 1,040  (16.5%) klebsiella pneumoniae, 590 (9.4%) proteus mirabilis, and 460 (7.3%) enterobacter sp. isolates. excluding the species with intrinsic resistance to each antibiotic, antimicrobial susceptibility was highest for colistin (5,275/5,441 isolates [96.9%]) and isepamicin (6,103/6,296 [96.9%]), followed by  meropenem (5,890/6,296 [93.6%]), imipenem (5,874/6,296 [93.3%]), and amikacin (5,492/6,296 [87.2%]). the antimicrobial susceptibility of the 1,040 k. pneumoniae isolates was highest for isepamicin (95.3%), followed by colistin (89.3%) and meropenem (63.0%). regarding resistant k. pneumoniae isolates, susceptibility to isepamicin was observed for 91.1% of the 392, 87.7% of the 375, and 85.6% of the 111 isolates that were nonsusceptible to the carbapenems, all other aminoglycosides, and colistin, respectively. isepamicin exhibited high in vitro activity against almost all of the enterobacteriaceae species. it could particularly serve as a last-resort therapeutic option for carbapenem-resistant k. pneumoniae in our region, where it is endemic, as it does not show considerable cross-resistance with other aminoglycosides.

TI  == coastal seawater bacteria harbor a large reservoir of plasmid-mediated quinolone  resistance determinants in jiaozhou bay, china.
AB  == diversity and prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants were investigated in environmental bacteria isolated from surface seawater of jiaozhou bay, china. five qnr gene alleles were identified in 34 isolates by pcr  amplification, including qnra3 gene in a shewanella algae isolate, qnrb9 gene in  a citrobacter freundii isolate, qnrd gene in 22 proteus vulgaris isolates, qnrs1  gene in 1 enterobacter sp. and 4 klebsiella spp. isolates, and qnrs2 gene in 1 pseudomonas sp. and 4 pseudoalteromonas sp. isolates. the qnrc, aac(6')-ib-cr, and qepa genes could not be detected in this study. the 22 qnrd-positive proteus  vulgaris isolates could be differentiated into four genotypes based on eric-pcr assay. the qnrs1 and qnrd genes could be transferred to escherichia coli j53 azi(r) or e. coli top10 recipient strains using conjugation or transformation methods. among the 34 qnr-positive isolates, 30 had a single point mutation in the qrdrs of gyra protein (ala67ser, ser83ile, or ser83thr), indicating that cooperation of chromosome- and plasmid-mediated resistance contributed to the spread and evolution of quinolone resistance in this coastal bay. eighty-five percent of the isolates were also found to be resistant to ampicillin, and bla(cmy), bla(oxy), bla(shv), and bla(tem) genes were detected in five isolates that also harbored the qnrb9 or qnrs1 gene. our current study is the first identification of qnrs2 gene in pseudoalteromonas and pseudomonas strains, and qnrd gene in proteus vulgaris strains. high prevalence of diverse qnr genes in jiaozhou bay indicates that coastal seawater may serve as an important reservoir, natural source, and dissemination vehicle of quinolone resistance determinants.

TI  == chromate-resistance genes in plasmids from antibiotic-resistant nosocomial enterobacterial isolates.
AB  == the presence of chromate-resistance genes in enterobacteria was evaluated in a collection of 109 antibiotic-resistant nosocomial isolates from nine major cities in mexico. results were compared with the presence of mercury-resistance genes. susceptibility tests showed that 21% of the isolates were resistant to chromate (cr(r)), whereas 36% were resistant to mercury (hg(r)). cr(r) levels were high in klebsiella pneumoniae (61%), low in enterobacter cloacae (12%) and escherichia coli (4%), and null in salmonella sp. isolates. colony hybridization demonstrated that the majority of metal-resistant isolates hybridized with chra gene (87% of cr(r) isolates), encoding a chr transporter homologue, and mera gene (74% of hg(r) isolates), encoding mera mercuric reductase, suggesting that most isolates  expressed these widespread metal-resistance systems. southern blot hybridization  of cr(r) isolates showed that plasmids of 80, 85, and 95 kb from k. pneumoniae isolates, and of 100 kb from an e. cloacae isolate, contained chra-related sequences. these plasmids belonged to incn or incp incompatibility groups, and conferred cr(r), as well as multiple antibiotic resistance, when transferred by conjugation to an e. coli standard strain. these data indicated that cr(r) genes  may be distributed among clinical enterobacteria via conjugative plasmids, probably by coselection with antibiotic-resistant genes.

TI  == analysis of the dna region mediating increased thermotolerance at 58 degrees c in cronobacter sp. and other enterobacterial strains.
AB  == cronobacter spp. are opportunistic pathogens associated with serious infections in neonates. the increased stress tolerance, including thermoresistance, of some  cronobacter strains can promote their survival in production facilities and thus  raise the possibility of contamination of dried infant milk formula, which has been identified as a potential source of infection. in this study, we characterized a dna region which is present in some cronobacter strains and which contributes to their prolonged survival at 58 degrees c. the 18 kbp long region containing 22 open reading frames was sequenced in cronobacter sakazakii atcc 29544. the major feature of the region contained a cluster of conserved genes, most of them having significant homologies with bacterial proteins involved in some type of stress response, including heat, oxidation and acid stress. the same thermoresistance dna region was detected in strains belonging to the genera cronobacter, enterobacter, citrobacter and escherichia and its presence positively correlated with increased thermotolerance.

AB  == background: conjunctivitis, an inflammation of the conjunctiva, is one of the most common eye problems affecting all age groups in nigeria. a better understanding of its epidemiology and the antibiotic susceptibility of etiologic  bacterial agents is crucial for the initiation of preventive and therapeutic measures. this study determined the distribution and patterns of bacterial infections in nigerian patients with conjunctivitis. antibiotic resistance patterns and the plasmid profiles of these pathogens were also investigated. methodology: a total of 83 consecutive and non-duplicate conjunctival specimens were collected from patients attending eye clinics at three different hospitals in lagos, nigeria, between february and september 2010. specimens were cultured on standard bacteriologic media and the recovered isolates speciated using standard techniques. susceptibility of pathogens to antibiotics and plasmid dna extraction were carried out by disk diffusion and alkaline lysis methods. conjugation experiment was done with rifampicin-resistant escherichia coli dh5alpha as the recipient cell. data were analyzed using the chi-square test. results: all the specimens were culture-positive, yielding a total of 155 bacterial isolates. gram-positive cocci comprising staphylococcus aureus (27.7%)  and coagulase-negative staphylococcus sp. (22.6%) accounted for 50.3% (78 of 155) of conjunctivitis cases, followed by gram-positive bacilli (22.6%), gram-negative bacilli (21.3%), and gram-negative cocci (4.5%). corynebacterium spp. were the most commonly isolated gram-positive bacilli accounting for 16.1% of conjunctivitis cases. pseudomonas aeruginosa topped with 9.7% as the most commonly isolated gram-negative bacilli. other gram-negative bacilli in order of  their isolations were e. coli (6.5%), proteus sp. (3.2%), klebsiella sp. (1.9%),  and enterobacter aerogenes (1.9%). moraxella spp. were the only gram-negative cocci isolated, and they accounted for 4.5% of the total conjunctival infections. further analysis of the complexity of infections showed that 25 specimens elicited mono-infections, while cases of polymicrobial infections caused by two pathogens and three or more pathogens constituted 51.8% and 18.1% of conjunctivitis specimens screened, respectively. the disparity in the percentage  contribution of three infection patterns was significant (p < 0.05). antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed chloramphenicol and ofloxacin as the least and most active antibiotics tested as 99 (63.9%) and 149 (96.1%) of the 155 recovered isolates were sensitive to them. on the whole, the least susceptible pathogen was p. aeruginosa with sensitivities ranging from 20% to 80%, while moraxella sp. represented the most sensitive pathogen with sensitivities ranging from 71.4% to  100%. other bacterial isolates also elicited antibiotic sensitivities in the range of 33.3-100%. a total of 101 isolates were screened for plasmids, of which  45 harbored plasmids, yielding a plasmid frequency of 44.6%. conjugal transfer of resistance to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and streptomycin was detected in the transconjugants after the mating experiment. the antibiotic resistances were transferred either singly or in combination from six of the seven selected donor  strains. the antibiotic resistance pattern transferred by these donor strains was partial and was associated with the transfer of r plasmids of sizes 21.3, 15.2, and 5.0 kb from three of the six transferable strains. the frequencies of transfer of antibiotype or r plasmids to the transconjugants ranged from 1.8 x 10(-7) to 1.4 x 10(-5) transconjugants per donor strain. conclusion: conjunctivitis as an eye problem in lagos is polymicrobial with infections associated with transferable r plasmids for chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and streptomycin. continuous surveillance of conjunctivitis in relation to etiology,  drug susceptibility, and plasmid transferability in the study area is therefore recommended.

TI  == cloning, sequencing, and overexpression in escherichia coli of the enterobacter sp. px6-4 gene for ferulic acid decarboxylase.
AB  == ferulic acid decarboxylase (fadase) can catalyze the transformation of ferulic acid into 4-vinyl guaiacol via decarboxylation in microorganisms. in this study,  a gene encoding fadase was first isolated from the bacterium enterobacter sp. px6-4 using degenerate primers and a genome walking technique. the putative encoding gene (fad) of fadase consists of 507-bp nucleotides, coding a polypeptide of 168 amino acid residues. in addition, a putative gene encoding the transcriptional regulator was identified from the upstream of the fad gene. the deduced peptide sequence of the fadase from enterobacter sp. px6-4 showed a 51.2-53.3% sequence identity to decarboxylases from other bacteria. the gene fad  was successfully expressed in escherichia coli bl21, and the recombinant fadase was purified as a protein of ca. 23 kda with an optimal activity at ph 4.0 and 28 degrees c. the purified fadase could convert ferulic acid to 4-vinyl guaiacol effectively, and its hydrolytic activity could be inhibited by cu(2+) (99%) and hg(2+) (99.5%). a phylogenetic analysis of the fadase protein from bacteria revealed several different clades. our result provided a basis for further studies of the ferulic acid transformation pathway and for enhanced production of vanillin in the future.

TI  == reconstruction of the violacein biosynthetic pathway from duganella sp. b2 in different heterologous hosts.
AB  == violacein is a bacteria-originated indolocarbazole pigment with potential applications due to its various bioactivities such as anti-tumor, antiviral, and  antifungal activities. however, stable mass production of this pigment is difficult due to its low productivities and the instability of wild-type violacein-producing strains. in order to establish a stable and efficient production system for violacein, the violacein synthesis pathway from a new species of duganella sp. b2 was reconstructed in different bacterial strains including escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, and enterobacter aerogenes by using different vectors. the gene cluster that encodes five enzymes involved in the violacein biosynthetic pathway was first isolated from duganella sp. b2, and  three recombinant expression vectors were constructed using the t7 promoter or the alkane-responsive promoter palkb. our results showed that violacein could be  stably synthesized in e. coli, c. freundii, and e. aerogenes. interestingly, we found that there were great differences between the different recombinant strains, not only in the protein expression profiles pertaining to violacein biosynthesis but also in the productivity and composition of crude violacein. among the host strains tested, the crude violacein production by the recombinant  c. freundii strain reached 1.68 g l(-1) in shake flask cultures, which was 4-fold higher than the highest production previously reported in flask culture by other  groups. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the efficient production of violacein by genetically engineered strains.

TI  == proteomic profiling of l-cysteine induced selenite resistance in enterobacter sp. ysu.
AB  == background: enterobacter sp. ysu is resistant to several different heavy metal salts, including selenite. a previous study using m-9 minimal medium showed that  when the selenite concentration was 100,000 times higher than the sulfate concentration, selenite entered escherichia coli cells using two pathways: a specific and a non-specific pathway. in the specific pathway, selenite entered the cells through a yet to be characterized channel dedicated for selenite. in the non-specific pathway, selenite entered the cells through a sulfate permease channel. addition of l-cystine, an l-cysteine dimer, appeared to indirectly decrease selenite import into the cell through the non-specific pathway. however, it did not affect the level of selenite transport into the cell through the specific pathway. results: growth curves using m-9 minimal medium containing 40 mm selenite and 1 mm sulfate showed that enterobacter sp. ysu grew when l-cysteine was present but died when it was absent. differential protein expression analysis by two dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that cysk was present in cultures containing selenite and lacking l-cysteine but absent in cultures containing both selenite and l-cysteine. additional rt-pcr studies demonstrated that transcripts for the sulfate permease genes, cysa, cyst and cysw, were down-regulated in the presence of l-cysteine. conclusion: l-cysteine appeared to confer selenite resistance upon enterobacter sp. ysu by decreasing the level of selenite transport into the cell through the non-specific pathway.

AB  == simultaneous cultivations in anaerobiosis, aerobiosis and with microaerobic gas mixture were used to clarify the bile (oxgall) effects on the pure and mixed cultures of enterobacterial strains in simulations in portable microbe enrichment unit (pmeu) linked with chempro100i((r)) gas detector. the effects of vancomycin  were evaluated in aerobic cultures. growth and metabolic activity of cultures were also followed by measuring sugar consumption, ph alterations, and colony counts on bd chromagar orientation plates. results showed that the two fermentatively different strains of facultative anaerobes, escherichia coli e 17  and klebsiella mobilis atcc 13048 grew in balance regardless of oxygen level, bile acid concentration or other components of the mixed cultures, bacillus cereus or staphylococcus aureus. when the evaporations of the mixed cultures of e. coli, k. mobilis and s. aureus were compared with the emissions of the corresponding pure cultures by chempro100i((r)) gas sensing detector, the pure cultures of bile resistant e. coli and k. mobilis produced more gaseous components than the mixed culture indicating that these organisms cooperate and use the substrate more effectively together than separately. a survey of the aseptic bacterial isolations from the bile tract in a big university hospital, (salzburg, austria) during 3 years, showed that these bacterial groups dominated. only 13.24% of the 287 patient samples were sterile, and around 180 strains of both e. coli and klebsiella/enterobacter groups were found amongst 973 isolates from 249 patients (together 35.57%). enterococcus sp. accounted for 246 isolates  being the largest group of strains (24.25% of all the isolates). in anaerobiosis  it was shown that klebsiella neutralized the acids produced in the mixed acid fermentation of the e. coli. the ethanol produced from both groups evaporated in  the gas stream of the pmeu culturing step and its formation also removes excess acidity from the cultures. the synergistic behaviour and symbiotic function between e. coli and klebsiella/enterobacter strains is suggested.

TI  == frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria isolated from 2 hospitals in makkah, saudi arabia.
AB  == objective: to estimate the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of the gram-negative bacteria isolated from 2 hospitals in makkah. methods: this study was undertaken in 2 main tertiary care hospitals namely; al-noor specialist hospital, and hera hospital in makkah, kingdom of saudi arabia from october 2005  to march 2006. a total of 1137 gram-negative bacteria were identified in non-duplicate clinical specimens obtained from 965 patients of various body sites infections. demographic data, identity of microorganisms, and antimicrobial susceptibilities were obtained from medical and laboratory records. results: the  most prevalent gram-negative bacteria were escherichia coli (31.6%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (31.2%), followed by acinetobacter baumannii (10.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (8.3%), klebsiella sp. (6.2%), haemophilus influenzae (3.7%), proteus sp. (3.3%), and enterobacter sp. (1.9%). results demonstrated that gram-negative bacteria have a high rate of resistance to commonly used antibiotics. furthermore, multi-drug resistance was also common in this study. conclusion: our data showed a high rate of resistance among gram-negative pathogens in comparison with other countries in the world. the implementation of  monitoring programs is an important part of the prevention strategy against the development of antibiotic resistance in hospitals.

TI  == molecular cloning and functional characterization of a sucrose isomerase (isomaltulose synthase) gene from enterobacter sp. fmb-1.
AB  == aims: isomaltulose (palatinose) is a slowly digestible sucrose isomer that can reduce both the glycemic and insulinemic response to foods. the aim of this study was to clone and express a sucrose isomerase (siase) gene and characterize the protein that is responsible for the production of isomaltulose in the micro-organism enterobacter sp. fmb-1. methods and results: a cosmid clone containing c. 6 kbp region encoding an siase gene was identified. the 5969-bp chromosomal dna fragment covering the siase (esi) gene in enterobacter sp. fmb-1  was sequenced. although this dna fragment contained several open reading frames other than esi, only the presence of esi was sufficient to produce isomaltulose in recombinant escherichia coli. the esi gene was expressed in e. coli, leading to the characterization of its siase activity. conclusions: the enterobacter sp.  fmb-1 esi gene was successfully cloned and expressed in e. coli. this gene encoded a functional siase that produced isomaltulose from sucrose. significance  and impact of the study: this is the first molecular analysis of an siase gene in an enterobacter strain. the functional expression of the enterobacter sp. fmb-1 esi gene in e. coli offers an alternative choice for the industrial production of isomaltulose.

TI  == fate of the h-ns-repressed bgl operon in evolution of escherichia coli.
AB  == in the enterobacterial species escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, expression of horizontally acquired genes with a higher than average at content is repressed by the nucleoid-associated protein h-ns. a classical example of an h-ns-repressed locus is the bgl (aryl-beta,d-glucoside) operon of e. coli. this locus is "cryptic," as no laboratory growth conditions are known to relieve repression of bgl by h-ns in e. coli k12. however, repression can be relieved by  spontaneous mutations. here, we investigated the phylogeny of the bgl operon. typing of bgl in a representative collection of e. coli demonstrated that it evolved clonally and that it is present in strains of the phylogenetic groups a,  b1, and b2, while it is presumably replaced by a cluster of orfans in the phylogenetic group d. interestingly, the bgl operon is mutated in 20% of the strains of phylogenetic groups a and b1, suggesting erosion of bgl in these groups. however, bgl is functional in almost all b2 isolates and, in approximately 50% of them, it is weakly expressed at laboratory growth conditions. homologs of bgl genes exist in klebsiella, enterobacter, and erwinia  species and also in low gc-content gram-positive bacteria, while absent in e. albertii and salmonella sp. this suggests horizontal transfer of bgl genes to an  ancestral enterobacterium. conservation and weak expression of bgl in isolates of phylogenetic group b2 may indicate a functional role of bgl in extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli.

TI  == changes in bacterial isolates from burn wounds and their antibiograms: a 20-year  study (1986-2005).
AB  == background: our aim is to elucidate shifts in the bacterial spectrum colonising burn wounds and corresponding antibiotic susceptibilities during a 20-year study  period. methods: microbiological results from burn patients collected between 1986 and 2005 were analysed retrospectively. results: staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (20.8%), followed by escherichia coli (13.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (10.9%), enterococcus sp. (9.7%), enterobacter cloacae (5.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5%), acinetobacter sp. (3.2%), proteus mirabilis (2%) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.4%). susceptibility of s. aureus to broad-spectrum substances such as ciprofloxacin or penicillinase-stable penicillins has waned, others such as cotrimoxazole or netilmicin remained effective. not a single resistance against vancomycin was recorded. increases in methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) were pronounced (3% in 1986-1997 (the first of the three study periods) to 16% in 1998-2001 and 13% in 2002-2005). results for methicillin-resistant cns (mrcns) show an even greater increase. p. aeruginosa has shown increasing susceptibility  against netilmicin (1986-1989: 84%, 2002-2005: 95%). susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to ceftazidime has decreased markedly. s. maltophilia has shown clinically relevant susceptibility mainly against ciprofloxacin. acinetobacter sp. have shown little susceptibility to most antibiotics. imipenem or meropenem have been very reliable reserve antibiotics throughout the study period for the fermenting enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae and p. mirabilis), with susceptibilities of or near 100%. conclusion: in-depth knowledge of the bacteria causing infectious complications and of their antibiotic susceptibilities is a prerequisite for treating burn patients. our study shows shifts in the microbial spectrum and their antibiogram, which mandate frequent reassessments.

TI  == bacterial contamination in drinking water: a case study in rural areas of northern rajasthan, india.
AB  == the objective of this study was to determine the bacterial contaminations in drinking water samples collected form some rural habitations of northern rajasthan, india. a total of ten bacterial species: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella sp, proteus vulgaris, alcaligenes  faecalis, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus lactis and micrococcus luteum were identified form drinking water samples. the bacteria belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae (coliforms) showed the maximum occurrences in water samples. the total coliforms count, i.e. ttc(m) (m = mpn index/100 ml) in drinking water samples was in the ranges of 25 ttc(m) (village naiwala)-41 ttc(m) (village meharwala). the data suggested that the drinking water quality deterioration in rural habitations of this region was due to poor sanitation and unawareness about personal hygienic practices. the occurrences some pathogenic bacteria in drinking water may increase the risks of water-related diseases and health problems in local residents.

TI  == diversity of root associated microorganisms of selected medicinal plants and influence of rhizomicroorganisms on the antimicrobial property of coriandrum sativum.
AB  == the total heterotrophic bacteria, actinomycetes and fungus were enumerated from the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil of 50 selected locally available medicinal plants in and around bharathiar university. in all the plants, population of microorganism were higher in the rhizosphere soil than in the non rhizosphere soil. among the microorganisms, bacterial population was higher in number followed by fungus and actinomycetes. of the medicinal plants, the maximum rhizosphere effect was observed in annona squamosa and the minimum effect was seen in eclipta alba and cassia auriculata. among the bacteria the dominant species was bacillus followed by pseudomonas, enterobacter, corynebacterium, micrococcus and serratia. the streptomyces species was found to be dominant followed by deuteromycetes and frankia among the actinomycetes. among the fungal  isolates rhizopus was found to be higher in number followed by aspergillus, penicillium, mucor and fusarium. about 70.96% of the bacterial isolates were found to be nitrate reducers and 90.60% of the bacteria solubilised phosphate. the rhizosphere bacterial isolates were also capable of hydrolyzing starch, cellulose, casein, urea and gelatin. the isolates of bacteria, actinomycetes and  fungus were also able to produce phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (iaa). the maximum iaa production was recorded by fusarium sp (5.8 mg/l). the rhizosphere bacterial isolates showed resistance to 14 commercially used antibiotics. in an attempt to check the influence of these plant growth promoting microorganisms on  the antimicrobial property of coriandrum sativum against escherichia coli mtcc-443 and aeromonas hydrophila mtcc-646, the results observed was not encouraging since the inoculants did not influence the antibacterial property. however extensive and in depth study is required to find out the influence of rhizomicroorganisms on the antibacterial property of medicinal plants. the other  results clearly indicated that the rhizosphere microorganisms could be exploited  for its innumerable properties and active metabolites.

TI  == a dormancy state in nonspore-forming bacteria.
AB  == while cultivation is a convenient way of proliferating and understanding bacteria, studies have shown the formation of nonculturable cells in nonspore-forming bacteria in response to environmental stress and thus in turn have generated immense interest. whether these cells are in a state of dormancy or in a stage preceding cell death has been considered of paramount importance for the past couple of decades. in this study, osmotic-stress-induced dormant bacterial cells were separated by cell sorting and revived by osmotic down-shift  in the absence of nutrients, source(s) that potentially could supply nutrients, and/or the external addition of resuscitation factor(s). reversal of dormancy followed a definite pattern akin to population asynchrony of dormant cells, and the phenomenon was observed across three species, namely, enterobacter sp. strain mcp11b, klebsiella pneumonia strain mcp11d and escherichia coli. in addition, our study precisely forecasted the presence of multiple subpopulations in dormant cells, which is explained by an emerging theory of survival mechanisms in stressful environments. these observations reveal that the state of dormancy induced by environmental stress in these nonspore-forming bacteria is "reversible" and also implies that it is an orderly and spontaneous adaptation to circumvent adverse conditions.

TI  == growth, encystment and survival of acanthamoeba castellanii grazing on different  bacteria.
AB  == free-living amoebae of the genus acanthamoeba are widely distributed in soil and  water collections, where trophozoites (vegetative, multiplicative stages) feed mainly by phagocytosis and thus control bacterial populations in the environment. here, we examined the growth, encystment and survival of acanthamoeba castellanii receiving different bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, bacillus subtilis, bacillus megaterium, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus) in nonnutrient saline. all bacteria assayed induced a  dose-dependent proliferative response, in most cases maximized with a bacterial dose of 1 x 10(9) ml(-1); except for m. luteus, trophozoites grew better with viable than with heat-killed bacteria. in addition, acanthamoeba growth was improved by adding bacteria on alternate days. single-dose experiments indicated  a temporal association between the growth of trophozoite and bacterial consumption, and higher consumption of m. luteus, e. coli and p. aeruginosa, bacterial species that allowed the highest trophozoite yields. long-term acanthamoeba-bacteria incubation revealed that encystment was significantly delayed by almost all the bacteria assayed (including s. aureus, which elicited a poor growth response) and that the presence of bacteria markedly increased cyst yield; final cyst recovery clearly depended on both the dose and the type of the  bacterium given, being much higher with e. coli, m. luteus and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == type 3 fimbriae, encoded by the conjugative plasmid pola52, enhance biofilm formation and transfer frequencies in enterobacteriaceae strains.
AB  == the conjugative plasmid pola52, which confers resistance to olaquindox and other  antimicrobial agents through a multidrug efflux pump, was investigated for its ability to promote biofilm formation in escherichia coli. screening of a transposon-mutagenized pola52 clone library revealed several biofilm-deficient mutants, which all mapped within a putative operon with high homology to the mrkabcdf operon of klebsiella pneumoniae, where these genes are responsible for type 3 fimbriae expression, attachment to surfaces and biofilm formation. biofilm formation in microtitre plates and in urinary catheters of clones containing pola52 with a disrupted putative mrk operon was reduced by more than 100-fold and 2-fold, respectively, compared to mutants with an intact mrk operon. the conjugative transfer rate of pola52 was also significantly lower when the mrk operon was disrupted. through reverse transcriptase analysis, it was demonstrated that the genes contained in the putative mrk operon were linked and likely to be  expressed as a single operon. immunoblotting with type 3 fimbriae (mrka)-specific antibodies further verified expression of type 3 fimbriae. when transferred to other, potentially pathogenic, members of the family enterobacteriaceae, including klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhimurium, kluyvera sp. and enterobacter aerogenes, pola52 facilitated increased biofilm formation. pola52 is believed to represent the first example of a conjugative plasmid encoding type 3  fimbriae, resulting in enhanced conjugation frequencies and biofilm formation of  the plasmid-harbouring strain.

TI  == substrate specificity of the oqxab multidrug resistance pump in escherichia coli  and selected enteric bacteria.
AB  == objectives: a plasmid-encoded multidrug efflux pump, oqxab, identified in escherichia coli of porcine origin, was tested for substrate specificity against  selected antibiotics, detergents and disinfectants. the ability of horizontal transfer to food-borne pathogens of the enterobacteriaceae family was also investigated. methods: the mics of selected substrates were determined with a broth dilution assay using two isogenic e. coli strains, except for the presence  of the oqxab operon. a derivative of the plasmid encoding oqxab (pola52) was constructed and horizontal transfer to salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, kluyvera sp. and enterobacter aerogenes was investigated. the effect  of the presence of the oqxab pump on susceptibility for selected compounds was investigated using broth dilution assays. results: the oqxab pump conferred antimicrobial resistance or reduced susceptibility towards a variety of substrates in e. coli. these included animal growth promoters, antimicrobials, disinfectants and detergents. pola52 could readily be transferred to enterobacterial pathogens. transconjugants showed reduced susceptibility towards  chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin and olaquindox. conclusions: the plasmid-encoded oqxab pump has a wide substrate specificity and can be transferred between enterobacteriaceae conferring reduced susceptibility to a multitude of substrates. these results could indicate some dependence on the outer membrane proteins present in the different species.

TI  == inhibition of hydrogen uptake in escherichia coli by expressing the hydrogenase from the cyanobacterium synechocystis sp. pcc 6803.
AB  == background: molecular hydrogen is an environmentally-clean fuel and the reversible (bi-directional) hydrogenase of the cyanobacterium synechocystis sp. pcc 6803 as well as the native escherichia coli hydrogenase 3 hold great promise  for hydrogen generation. these enzymes perform the simple reaction 2h+ + 2e- <--> h2 (g). results: hydrogen yields were enhanced up to 41-fold by cloning the bidirectional hydrogenase (encoded by hoxefuyh) from the cyanobacterium into e. coli. using an optimized medium, e. coli cells expressing hoxefuyh also produced  twice as much hydrogen as the well-studied enterobacter aerogenes hu-101, and hydrogen gas bubbles are clearly visible from the cultures. overexpression of hoxu alone (small diaphorase subunit) accounts for 43% of the additional hydrogen produced by hoxefuyh. in addition, hydrogen production in e. coli mutants with defects in the native formate hydrogenlyase system show that the cyanobacterial hydrogenase depends on both the native e. coli hydrogenase 3 as well as on its maturation proteins. hydrogen absorption by cells expressing hoxefuyh was up to 10 times lower than cells which lack the cloned cyanobacterial hydrogenase; hence, the enhanced hydrogen production in the presence of hoxefuyh is due to inhibition of hydrogen uptake activity in e. coli. hydrogen uptake by cells expressing hoxefuyh was suppressed in three wild-type strains and in two hyce mutants but not in a double mutant defective in hydrogenase 1 and hydrogenase 2;  hence, the active cyanobacterial locus suppresses hydrogen uptake by hydrogenase  1 and hydrogenase 2 but not by hydrogenase 3. differential gene expression indicated that overexpression of hoxefuyh does not alter expression of the native e. coli hydrogenase system; instead, biofilm-related genes are differentially regulated by expression of the cyanobacterial enzymes which resulted in 2-fold elevated biofilm formation. this appears to be the first enhanced hydrogen production by cloning a cyanobacterial enzyme into a heterologous host. conclusion: enhanced hydrogen production in e. coli cells expressing the cyanobacterial hoxefuyh is by inhibiting hydrogen uptake of both hydrogenase 1 and hydrogenase 2.

TI  == simvastatin improves the healing of infected skin wounds of rats.
AB  == purpose: this study explores the potential of the simvastatin to ameliorate inflammation and infection in open infected skin wounds of rats. methods: fourteen wistar rats weighing 285 +/- 12g were used. the study was done in a group whose open infected skin wounds were treated with topical application of simvastatin microemulsion (sim, n=7) and a second group with wounds treated with  saline 0.9 % (sal, n=7). a bacteriological exam of the wounds fluid for gram positive and gram negative bacteria, the tecidual expression of tnfa and il-1a by immunohistochemical technique, and histological analysis by he stain were performed. results: the expression of tnfa could be clearly demonstrated in lower degree in skin wounds treated with simvastatin (668.6 +/- 74.7 im(2)) than in saline (2120.0 +/-327.1 im(2)). in comparison, wound tissue from sim group displayed leukocyte infiltration significantly lower than that observed in sal group (p<0.05). culture results of the samples taken from wound fluid on fourth post treatment day revealed wound infection in only one rat of group simvastatin  (sim), where proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli and enterobacter sp were isolated. in the rats whose wounds were treated with saline (sal), polymicrobial  infection with more than 100,000 cfu/g was detected in all the wounds. conclusion: in addition to its antiinflammatory properties, the protective effects of simvastatin in infected open skin wounds is able to reduce infection and probably has antibacterial action. the potential to treat these wounds with statins to ameliorate inflammation and infection is promising.

AB  == using protocols designed for the isolation of shigella from environmental freshwater samples from different regions of bangladesh, 11 bacterial strains giving rise to shigella-like colonies on selective agar plates and showing serological cross-reaction with shigella-specific antisera were isolated. phylogenetic analyses revealed that three of the isolates were most closely related to escherichia coli, four to enterobacter sp., two to stenotrophomonas, and two isolates belonged to the gram-positive genus aerococcus. the isolates cross-reacted with six different serotypes of shigella and were, in each case, highly type-specific. two of the isolates belonging to the enterobacter and escherichia genera gave extremely strong cross-reactivity with shigella dysenteriae and shigella boydii antisera, respectively. the aerococcus isolates gave relatively weak but significant cross-reactions with s. dysenteriae. western blot analysis revealed that a number of antigens from the isolates cross-react with shigella spp. the results indicate that important shigella spp. surface antigens are shared by a number of environmental bacteria, which have implications for the use of serological methods in attempts for the detection and recovery of shigella from aquatic environments.

AB  == the aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence and molecular diversity of beta-lactamase genes and integrons among gram-negative ampicillin-resistant bacteria from ria de aveiro. ampicillin-resistant isolates were selected and subjected to genotyping using rep-pcr. representatives from each rep pattern were affiliated with the following taxa by sequencing the 16s rrna gene: aeromonas caviae, a. hydrophila, a. media, a. molluscorum, a. veronii, a. salmonicida, aeromonas sp., pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas sp., escherichia coli, escherichia sp., shigella sonnei, shigella sp., klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, r. planticola, citrobacter freundii, morganella morganii and enterobacter sp. isolates affiliated with genera escherichia or shigella were identified as escherichia coli using phenotypic-based tests. pcr was used to assess beta-lactamase encoding sequences (bla(tem), bla(shv), bla(carb), bla(ctx-m), bla(imp), bla(vim), bla(cpha/imis), bla(oxa-a), bla(oxa-b), bla(oxa-c)), class 1 and class 2 integrases, and integron variable regions. sequence analysis of pcr products was performed. beta-lactamase genes were detected in 77.8% of the enterobacteriaceae and in 10.5% of the aeromonas. the most frequently detected gene was bla(tem), followed by bla(shv,)bla(oxa-b),  bla(cpha/imis) and bla(carb). retrieved sequences shared high homology with previously described beta-lactamases. the inti1 gene was present in 29.6% of the  enterobacteriaceae and in 21% of the aeromonas isolates. the inti2 gene was present in 4 isolates. a total of 13 cassettes included in 12 different cassette  arrays were identified. the most frequently found resistance gene cassettes were  aada variants. previous investigations based on cultivation-independent approaches revealed higher molecular diversity among beta-lactamase-encoding sequences in this estuary. this fact reinforces the hypothesis that cultivation-dependent approaches may underestimate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in environmental samples and may introduce bias in the recovery  of their molecular variants.

TI  == screening for anti-infective properties of several medicinal plants of the mauritians flora.
AB  == several plants of the mauritian flora alleged to possess anti-infective properties were studied against different strains of pathogenic bacteria and fungi. the grounded dried plant materials were extracted with different extractants and screened for anti-microbial activity using the disk diffusion and the micro-dilution techniques. preliminary screening revealed that the methanol extracts were most active. salmonella enteritidis, enterobacter cloacae and bacillus subtilis were the three test organisms, which were found to be susceptible to all the crude methanolic extracts of the different plants investigated (100% susceptibility), followed by escherichia coli (57.1%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (57.1%), and staphylococcus aureus (28.6%). the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration recorded for the different crude methanol extracts against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, enterobacter cloacae, bacillus subtilis and the mould fungus candida albicans were 500, 1000, 125, 250, 1000 and 125 micro g/ml, respectively. bioautography using cladosporium cucumerinum revealed that dichloromethane (dcm) extracts had the highest activity against the phytopathogenic fungus. it was also noted that the dcm extracts of michelia champaca and antidesma madagascariense yielded the maximum number of growth inhibiting compounds against cladosporium cucumerinum. activity of the different crude extracts was also investigated against several phytopathogenic filamentous fungi, colletotrichum glocosporoides, rhizoctonia solani, sclerotinia sclerotium, guignardia sp. and fusarium oxysporum. it was found that crude hexane extracts as well as crude dcm extracts exhibited marked activity against several strains of fungi, especially colletotrichum glocosporoides, sclerotinia sclerotium and guignardia sp.

TI  == midgut bacteria required for bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal activity.
AB  == bacillus thuringiensis is the most widely applied biological insecticide and is used to manage insects that affect forestry and agriculture and transmit human and animal pathogens. this ubiquitous spore-forming bacterium kills insect larvae largely through the action of insecticidal crystal proteins and is commonly deployed as a direct bacterial spray. moreover, plants engineered with the cry genes encoding the b. thuringiensis crystal proteins are the most widely cultivated transgenic crops. for decades, the mechanism of insect killing has been assumed to be toxin-mediated lysis of the gut epithelial cells, which leads  to starvation, or b. thuringiensis septicemia. here, we report that b. thuringiensis does not kill larvae of the gypsy moth in the absence of indigenous midgut bacteria. elimination of the gut microbial community by oral administration of antibiotics abolished b. thuringiensis insecticidal activity, and reestablishment of an enterobacter sp. that normally resides in the midgut microbial community restored b. thuringiensis-mediated killing. escherichia coli  engineered to produce the b. thuringiensis insecticidal toxin killed gypsy moth larvae irrespective of the presence of other bacteria in the midgut. however, when the engineered e. coli was heat-killed and then fed to the larvae, the larvae did not die in the absence of the indigenous midgut bacteria. e. coli and  the enterobacter sp. achieved high populations in hemolymph, in contrast to b. thuringiensis, which appeared to die in hemolymph. our results demonstrate that b. thuringiensis-induced mortality depends on enteric bacteria.

TI  == purification, characterization, and gene cloning of 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase of enterobacter cloacae p240.
AB  == we found the occurrence of 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase in enterobacter cloacae p240, isolated from soils under anaerobic conditions, and purified the enzyme to homogeneity. the purified enzyme was a homohexamer of identical 60 kda  subunits. the purified decarboxylase catalyzed the nonoxidative decarboxylation of 4-hydroxybenzoate without requiring any cofactors. its km value for 4-hydroxybenzoate was 596 microm. the enzyme also catalyzed decarboxylation of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate, for which the km value was 6.80 mm. in the presence of 3 m khco3 and 20 mm phenol, the decarboxylase catalyzed the reverse carboxylation reaction of phenol to form 4-hydroxybenzoate with a molar conversion yield of 19%. the km value for phenol was calculated to be 14.8 mm. the gene encoding the  4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase was isolated from e. cloacae p240. nucleotide sequencing of recombinant plasmids revealed that the 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase gene codes for a 475-amino-acid protein. the amino acid sequence of the enzyme is similar to those of 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase of clostridium  hydroxybenzoicum (53% identity), vdcc protein (vanillate decarboxylase) of streptomyces sp. strain d7 (72%) and 3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase of escherichia coli (28%). the hypothetical proteins, showing 96-97% identities to the primary structure of e. cloacae p240 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase, were found in several bacterial strains.

TI  == confirmation of e. coli among other thermotolerant coliform bacteria in paper mill effluents, wood chips screening rejects and paper sludges.
AB  == paper sludges are solid wastes material generated from the paper production, which have been characterized for their chemical contents. some are rich in wood  fiber and are a good carbon source, for example the primary and de-inking paper sludges. others are made rich in nitrogen and phosphorus by pressing the activated sludge, resulting from the biological water treatments, with the primary sludge, yielding the combined paper sludge. still, in the absence of sanitary effluents very few studies have addressed the characterization of their  coliform microflora. therefore, this study investigated the thermotolerant coliform population of one paper mill effluent and two paper mill sludges and wood chips screening rejects using chromogenic media. for the first series of analyses, the medium used was colilert broth and positive tubes were selected to  isolate bacteria in pure culture on macconkey agar. in a second series of analyses, double selective media, based on ss-galactosidase and ss-glucuronidase  activities, were used to isolate bacteria. first, the presence of thermotolerant  coliforms was detected in low numbers in most water effluents, but showed that the entrance of the thermotolerant coliforms was early in the industrial process. also, large numbers of thermotolerant coliforms, i.e., 7,000,000 mpn/g sludge (dry weight; d.w.), were found in combined sludges. from this first series of isolations, bacteria were purified on macconkey medium and identified as citrobacter freundii, enterobacter sp, e. sakazakii, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, k. pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis, k. pneumoniae subsp.  ozaenae, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, pantoea sp, raoultella terrigena, r. planticola. second, the presence of thermotolerant coliforms was measured at more than 3,700-6,000 mpn/g (d.w) sludge, whereas e. coli was detected from 730 to more than 3,300 mpn/g (d.w.) sludge. the presence of thermotolerant coliform bacteria and e. coli was sometimes detected from wood chips screening rejects in  large quantities. also, indigenous e. coli were able to multiply into the combined sludge, and inoculated e. coli isolates were often able to multiply in wood chips and combined sludge media. in this second series of isolations, api20e and biolog identified most isolates as e. coli, but others remained unidentified. the sequences of the 16s rdna confirmed that most isolates were likely e. coli, few burkholderia spp, but 10% of the isolates remained unidentified. this study points out that the coliform bacteria are introduced by the wood chips in the water effluents, where they can survive throught the primary clarifier and regrow in combined sludges.

TI  == antifungal and antibacterial activities of mexican tarragon (tagetes lucida).
AB  == mexican tarragon (tagetes lucida cv. asteraceae: campanulatae) is an important, nutritious plant and an effective herbal medicine. seven coumarins, 7,8-dihydroxycoumarin (4), umbelliferone (7-hydroxycoumarin) (5), scoparone (6,7-dimethoxycoumarin) (7), esculetin (6,7-dihydroxycoumarin) (11), 6-hydroxy-7-methoxycoumarin (12), herniarin (7-methoxycoumarin) (13), and scopoletin (6-methoxy-7-hydroxycoumarin) (14), and three flavonoids, patuletin (18), quercetin (19), and quercetagetin (20), were isolated from ch2cl2 and meoh  extracts from aerial parts of t. lucida. in addition, 6,7-diacetoxy coumarin (15), 6-methoxy-7-acetylcoumarin (16), and 6-acetoxy-7-methoxycoumarin (17) derivatives were synthesized. 8-methoxypsoralen (1), 8-acetyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (2), 7,8-dihydroxy-6-meth-oxycoumarin (3), 6,7-dimethoxy-4-methylcoumarin (6), 5,7-dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (8), 4-hydroxycoumarin (9), 4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethylcoumarin (10), naringenin (21), glycoside-7-rhamnonaringin  (22), and rutin (23) were commercially obtained (sigma-aldrich). all of these compounds and extracts (m1 and m2) were assayed against bacteria and fungi. the antibacterial activity was determined on bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhi, salmonella sp., shigella boydii, shigella sp., enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter agglomerans,  sarcina lutea, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterolitica, vibrio cholerae (three el tor strains, cdc-v12, clinic case, and indre-206, were obtained from contaminated water), and v. cholerae (no-o1). the evaluated fungi were aspergillus niger, penicillium notatum, fusarium moniliforme, fusarium sporotrichum, rhizoctonia solani, and trichophyton mentagrophytes. the most active compounds against gram-positive and -negative bacteria were the dihydroxylated coumarins 3 and 4. in addition, 2-4, 6, 7, and 11 showed an interesting activity against v. cholerae, a key bacterium in the contaminated water; 2-4 were the most active. coumarins were the most effective compounds against gram-negative bacteria. the extract meoh/ch2cl2 (1: 4) m2 at 0.4 microg/disk inhibited the growth of e. coli and p. mirabilis (40%), k. pneumoniae (31.1%), salmonella sp. (35.5%), and shigella sp. (0%) at 72 h of culture. the dimethoxy compounds 6 and 7 showed a strong activity against fungal  strains, especially t. mentagrophytes and r. solani (100% of inhibition at 125.0  and 250.0 microg/ml, respectively).

TI  == engineering aromatic l-amino acid transaminase for the asymmetric synthesis of constrained analogs of l-phenylalanine.
AB  == an enzymatic asymmetric synthesis was carried out for the preparation of enantiomerically pure l-diphenylalanine using the rationally engineered aromatic  l-amino acid transaminase (earoates) obtained from enterobacter sp. bk2k-1. to rationally redesign the enzyme, structural model was constructed by the homology  modeling. the structural model was experimentally validated by the site-directed  mutagenesis of the predicted pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (plp) binding site and the substrate-recognition region, and the cell-free protein synthesis of mutated enzymes. it was suggested that arg281 and arg375 were the key residues to recognize the distal carboxylate and alpha-carboxylate group of the substrates, respectively. the model also predicted that tyr66 forms hydrogen bond with the phosphate moiety of plp and interacts with the side chain attached to beta-carbon of the amino acid substrate. among the various site-directed mutants, y66l variant was able to synthesize l-diphenylalanine with 23% conversion yield for 10 h, whereas the wild-type aroates was inactive for the transamination between diphenylpyruvate and l-phenylalanine as amino acceptor and amino donor, respectively.

TI  == purification and characterization of trzf: biuret hydrolysis by allophanate hydrolase supports growth.
AB  == trzf, the allophanate hydrolase from enterobacter cloacae strain 99, was cloned,  overexpressed in the presence of a chaperone protein, and purified to homogeneity. native trzf had a subunit molecular weight of 65,401 and a subunit stoichiometry of alpha(2) and did not contain significant levels of metals. trzf  showed time-dependent inhibition by phenyl phosphorodiamidate and is a member of  the amidase signature protein family. trzf was highly active in the hydrolysis of allophanate but was not active with urea, despite having been previously considered a urea amidolyase. trzf showed lower activity with malonamate, malonamide, and biuret. the allophanate hydrolase from pseudomonas sp. strain adp, atzf, was also shown to hydrolyze biuret slowly. since biuret and allophanate are consecutive metabolites in cyanuric acid metabolism, the low level of biuret hydrolase activity can have physiological significance. a recombinant escherichia coli strain containing atzd, encoding cyanuric acid hydrolase that produces biuret, and atzf grew slowly on cyanuric acid as a source of nitrogen. the amount of growth produced was consistent with the liberation of  3 mol of ammonia from cyanuric acid. in vitro, trzf was shown to hydrolyze biuret to liberate 3 mol of ammonia. the biuret hydrolyzing activity of trzf might also  be physiologically relevant in native strains. e. cloacae strain 99 grows on cyanuric acid with a significant accumulation of biuret.

AB  == (r)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutyrate (chb) and (s)-3-hydroxy-gamma-butyrolactone (hl) are used for the synthesis of biologically and pharmacologically important compounds. enterobacter sp. ds-s-75 was found to have the unique activity to convert (s)-chb in the racemate to (s)-hl through asymmetric dechlorination, hydrolysis, and lactonization. as a result, the remaining (r)-chb and formed (s)-hl could be obtained in a one-pot reaction. we purified the chb degrading enzyme which catalyzing these reactions and isolated the coding gene from the strain ds-s-75 in order to improve the productivity of these compounds using the  transformant. interestingly, the purified enzyme showed not only dechlorinating,  but also hydrolyzing activities on chb and the similar carboxylic esters, it was  then designated chb hydrolase, and appears to be a novel enzyme. the gene had 1101 bp encoding 367 amino acids including a signal peptide composed of 25 residues. the deduced amino acid sequence contained a conserved region generally  found in esterases and lipases, but did not have significant similarity. when asymmetric degradation of racemic methyl chb (chbm) was performed using a culture broth of escherichia coli dh5alpha transformed with the isolated gene, the reaction time was shortened 20-fold over that of the strain ds-s-75, and the maximum concentration of the substrate could be increased from 8% to 15% (w/v). moreover, both of the obtained residual (r)-chbm and the formed (s)-hl had high optical purities (>99% e.e.).

TI  == isolation of a novel plasmid, pni15, from enterobacter sp. ni15 containing a nickel resistance gene.
AB  == we isolated nickel-resistant bacterium from soil in order to identify a novel nickel resistance determinant. using 16s rrna gene sequencing, an isolate was identified as enterobacter sp. ni15. this species showed a medium-level (resistant to up to 10 mm) nickel resistance in nutrient-rich media. enterobacter sp. ni15 has a novel plasmid, pni15, and an increased nickel resistance to escherichia coli dh5alphain trans. to isolate the nickel resistance gene from pni15, the plasmid was digested with xbai and its fragments were cloned into pbluescriptiisk(+). the clones were transferred into e. coli dh5alpha. the nickel resistance of the clones was then assayed. from these results, a pni15100 isolate containing a 5,328 bp xbai fragment of pni15 was identified and sequenced. the e. coli dh5alpha harboring the pni15100 showed a resistance to up to 7 mm nickel. using a subcloning analysis, we were able to identify the novel nickel resistance determinant: the nrp gene encoding the putative proteins nrpa and nrpb.

TI  == pharmacodynamic modeling of imipenem-cilastatin, meropenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam for empiric therapy of skin and soft tissue infections: a report from the optama program.
AB  == background: the bactericidal exposures necessary for positive clinical outcomes among skin and soft tissue infections are largely dependent on interpatient pharmacokinetic variability and pathogen drug susceptibility. by simulating the probability of achieving target bactericidal exposures, the pharmacodynamics of three beta-lactam agents were compared against a range of pathogens implicated commonly in complicated skin and soft tissue infections. methods: using monte carlo simulation, pharmacodynamic target attainment expressed as the percentage of the time interval during which the antibiotic concentration exceeded the minimal inhibitory concentration (%t > mic) in serum and blister fluid was calculated for 5,000 simulated patients receiving imipenem-cilastatin 0.5 g q8h,  meropenem 0.5 g q8h, piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375 g q6h, and piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g q8h. the pharmacokinetics for each antibiotic were  derived from previously published healthy volunteer studies. the mics for staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter sp., klebsiella sp., coagulase-negative staphylococci, proteus sp., beta-hemolytic streptococci, and serratia sp. were taken from the mystic 2003 surveillance study and weighted by the prevalence of each pathogen among 1,404 isolates collected from skin and soft tissue infections during the 2000 sentry study. the prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was added into the model at increasing resistance rates. results: imipenem-cilastatin, meropenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375 g q6h achieved  greater than 90% likelihood of achieving bactericidal exposure in serum and blister fluid until the prevalence of mrsa increased beyond 10%. piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g q8h achieved a lower probability of achieving bactericidal exposure than the other regimens (88.7%, p < 0.001). conclusions: when the incidence of mrsa is low, imipenem-cilastatin, meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375 g q6h would be optimal choices for the empiric treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections among the regimens studied. when mrsa is suspected, a drug that retains activity against this pathogen should be considered.

TI  == differential activity of a lectin from solieria filiformis against human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == a lectin isolated from the red alga solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). the lectin (500 microg/ml) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus sp, and pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/ml but the lectin (10-1000 microg/ml) had no effect on  the growth of the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and b. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. the purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. it is possible that the interaction of s. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium b. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml. the stimulation of the growth of b.  cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/ml), its hapten. thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. the present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.

AB  == the complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. however, studies  on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. to clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16s rdna sequences from the dna isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16s rdna libraries were constructed with the amplicons of pcr conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. nine independent libraries were produced  by the application of three sets of primers (set a, set b, and set c) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. the library clone with set a universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. thus, set a primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. on the first day of the life of the infant, enterobacter, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, and streptococcus mitis were present. the largest taxonomic group was l. lactis. on the third day of the  life of the infant, enterobacter, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, s. mitis, and streptococcus salivarius were present. on the sixth day of the life of the infant, citrobacter, clostridium difficile, enterobacter sp., enterobacter cloacae, and e. coli were present. the largest taxonomic group was e. coli. these results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after  the third day.

TI  == [development and evaluation of a pcr method for diagnosis of salmonella enteric fever, based on dna sequences of the hila gene].
AB  == typically, diagnosis of enteric fever due to salmonella spp. is by bacterial isolation from blood culture; however, the blood culture method is slow, not always available, and not informative in patients with antibiotic treatment. salmonella spp. uses the hila gene (component of the pathogenicity island i) to invade epithelial cells and produce infection. using the hila gene sequence a pcr test was designed to detect salmonella in blood samples. the sensitivity (s), specificity (sp), positive predictive value (ppv) and negative predictive value (npv) of the pcr method were obtained by testing the blood samples from 34 patients with suspected of enteric fever. presence of s. typhi was confirmed by blood culture. blood samples were also tested from 35 patients with infections due to other non-salmonella pathogens, again corroborated by blood culture (klebsiella pneumoniae, 9; serratia marcescens, 5; escherichia coli, 4; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 9; providencia alcalifaciens, 4; enterobacter cloacae, 4). control samples were obtained from 150 healthy volunteers. the s, sp, ppv and npv for the pcr method were all 100%. the lowest number of colony forming units/ml detected by pcr in blood samples was 10.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == the antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  == previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against gram- escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against gram+ micrococcus sp., is melanization. we examined the immune responses mounted by aedes aegypti towards gram- enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium, and gram+ bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial gram type and pathogenicity. these data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to  the immune response against prokaryotes.

AB  == asymptomatic prostatitis is classified as category iv in nih classification of prostatitis syndrome (1999). no report concerning this category has been present. we investigated this category histopathologically and clinically, in order to clarify the histopathological distribution and its correlation to the clinical features, in this study. among 785 patients who were suspected prostate cancer because of their high prostatic specific antigen (psa) values and to have a sextant prostate needle biopsy was performed between january, 1996 and december,  2000, 88 patients (11.2%) were diagnosed as nih category iv prostatitis (asymptomatic prostatitis). we observed all pathological specimens stained with hematoxylin-eosine, and classified them into subtypes according to the classification criteria for prostatitis defined by true et al. (1999). we also investigated the relationship between histopathological distribution and clinical features such as psa values, psa density, the incidence of pyuria or bacteriuria. in the histopathological study, grade distributions were 12.5% (11/88) in mild, 71.6% (63/88) in moderate, and 15.9% (14/88) in severe. location distributions were 2.3% (2/88) in glandular, 68.2% (60/88) in periglandular, and 29.5% (26/88)  in stromal. no relationship between these subtypes and clinical features was recognized statistically. however, 7 patients (7.95%) were diagnosed as prostate  cancers, later. pyuria was found in 29.1% (23/79). bacteriuria was present in 14.3% (11/77). isolated bacteria were 4 strains of enterococcus faccalis, 2 strains of each of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, and one strain of each of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. gram positive rod, and candida sp. no relationship between these subtypes and bacterial species was recognized. these results indicated that the incidence of niii category iv prostatits was not low without correlation to any clinical features. however, we should pay attention to the presence of prostate cancer, because a small number of the patients were diagnosed as prostate cancer, later.

TI  == synergetic effect of gamma irradiation and moisture content on decontamination of sewage sludge.
AB  == samples of concentrated municipal sewage sludge, stored for 2, 4 and 6 months, with moisture contents of 2%, 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% were exposed to doses of 0,  1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 kilogray (kgy) of gamma irradiation. immediately after irradiation, total microbial count and bacterial pathogens in sewage sludge were  determined. the results indicated that in all tested sewage sludge samples, bacterial pathogens including enterobacter sp., klebsiella sp., salmonella sp., and escherichia coli were initially detected. all doses of gamma irradiation reduced the total counts of microorganisms. d(10) of total count decreased with increase in the moisture content of the sewage sludge. the lowest lethal dose for tested bacterial pathogens was 5 kgy in air dried sewage sludge. in addition for  wet sewage sludge having more than 40% moisture, the lethal dose was 1 kgy, for samples taken at different storage periods 2, 4 and 6 months, and therefore the cost per unit could be decreased to half when wet sewage sludge (about 50% moisture) was used.

TI  == surfactant proteins a and d inhibit the growth of gram-negative bacteria by increasing membrane permeability.
AB  == the pulmonary collectins, surfactant proteins a (sp-a) and d (sp-d), have been reported to bind lipopolysaccharide (lps), opsonize microorganisms, and enhance the clearance of lung pathogens. in this study, we examined the effect of sp-a and sp-d on the growth and viability of gram-negative bacteria. the pulmonary clearance of escherichia coli k12 was reduced in sp-a-null mice and was increased in sp-d-overexpressing mice, compared with strain-matched wild-type controls. purified sp-a and sp-d inhibited bacterial synthetic functions of several, but not all, strains of e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter aerogenes. in general, rough e. coli strains were more susceptible than smooth strains, and  collectin-mediated growth inhibition was partially blocked by coincubation with rough lps vesicles. although both sp-a and sp-d agglutinated e. coli k12 in a calcium-dependent manner, microbial growth inhibition was independent of bacterial aggregation. at least part of the antimicrobial activity of sp-a and sp-d was localized to their c-terminal domains using truncated recombinant proteins. incubation of e. coli k12 with sp-a or sp-d increased bacterial permeability. deletion of the e. coli ompa gene from a collectin-resistant smooth e. coli strain enhanced sp-a and sp-d-mediated growth inhibition. these data indicate that sp-a and sp-d are antimicrobial proteins that directly inhibit the  proliferation of gram-negative bacteria in a macrophage- and aggregation-independent manner by increasing the permeability of the microbial cell membrane.

TI  == extended spectrum beta-lactamase mediated resistance in urinary tract isolates of family enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == background & objectives: extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) hydrolyse expanded spectrum cephalosporins like ceftazidime, cefotaxime and monobactam aztreonam. esbl producing bacteria may not be detectable in the routine disk diffusion susceptibility tests leading to inappropriate use of antibiotics and treatment failures. as information on esbl producers causing urinary tract infection (uti) is not available from our country, the occurrence of esbl producing strains causing uti was studied as also the differences between the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of esbl and non-esbl producers. methods: urinary isolates (233) were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by stoke's method and esbl production by double disk diffusion method (ceftazidime and clavulanic acid). the clinical and demographic profile of the patients was noted. results: sixty two of the 233 isolates tested (26.6%) were esbl producers. approximately 38.5 per cent of klebsiellae, 24.7 per cent of escherichia coli, 24 per cent of enterobacter aerogenes, 33.3 per cent of proteus sp. and the only citrobacter strain produced esbl. recent surgery was found to be a significant (p < 0.01) risk factor for acquisition of esbls. approximately 30 per cent of the esbl producers appeared falsely sensitive or moderately sensitive to cefotaxime/ceftazidime in routine susceptibility testing. there was no difference between the esbl producers and non-producers in the susceptibility to non-beta lactam agents except for gentamicin. interpretation & conclusion: a high percentage of urinary tract isolates produced esbl. since they are likely to be missed in routine disk diffusion susceptibility tests, all microbiology laboratories should look for esbl production routinely to avoid treatment failures.

AB  == the complete 108,845-nucleotide sequence of catabolic plasmid padp-1 from pseudomonas sp. strain adp was determined. plasmid padp-1 was previously shown to encode atza, atzb, and atzc, which catalyze the sequential hydrolytic removal of  s-triazine ring substituents from the herbicide atrazine to yield cyanuric acid.  computational analyses indicated that padp-1 encodes 104 putative open reading frames (orfs), which are predicted to function in catabolism, transposition, and  plasmid maintenance, transfer, and replication. regions encoding transfer and replication functions of padp-1 had 80 to 100% amino acid sequence identity to pr751, an incpbeta plasmid previously isolated from enterobacter aerogenes. padp-1 was shown to contain a functional mercury resistance operon with 99% identity to tn5053. complete copies of transposases with 99% amino acid sequence  identity to tnpa from is1071 and tnpa from pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes were identified and flank each of the atza, atzb, and atzc genes, forming structures resembling nested catabolic transposons. functional analyses identified three new catabolic genes, atzd, atze, and atzf, which participate in atrazine catabolism.  crude extracts from escherichia coli expressing atzd hydrolyzed cyanuric acid to  biuret. atzd showed 58% amino acid sequence identity to trzd, a cyanuric acid amidohydrolase, from pseudomonas sp. strain nrrlb-12227. two other genes encoding the further catabolism of cyanuric acid, atze and atzf, reside in a contiguous cluster adjacent to a potential lysr-type transcriptional regulator. e. coli strains bearing atze and atzf were shown to encode a biuret hydrolase and allophanate hydrolase, respectively. atzdef are cotranscribed. atze and atzf are  members of a common amidase protein family. these data reveal the complete structure of a catabolic plasmid and show that the atrazine catabolic genes are dispersed on three disparate regions of the plasmid. these results begin to provide insight into how plasmids are structured, and thus evolve, to encode the  catabolism of compounds recently added to the biosphere.

TI  == comparison of the antimicrobial tolerance of oxytetracycline-resistant heterotrophic bacteria isolated from hospital sewage and freshwater fishfarm water in belgium.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between antimicrobial tolerance and taxonomic diversity among the culturable oxytetracycline-resistant  (ot(r)) heterotrophic bacterial population in two belgian aquatic sites receiving wastewater either from human medicine or from aquaculture. the study of ot(r) heterotrophs and mesophilic aeromonas spp. allowed comparison of tolerance data at the intergenus as well as at the intragenus level. in total, 354 independently obtained ot(r) isolates were subjected to antimicrobial tolerance testing and identified by glc analysis of their cellular fatty acid methyl esters (fames), by api 20e profiling and/or by fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (faflp) dna fingerprinting. in general, ot(r) hospital heterotrophs displayed a higher frequency (84%) of ampicillin (amp) tolerance compared to the ot(r) heterotrophs from the freshwater fishfarm site (22%). fame results indicated that this effect was linked to the predominance of intrinsically ampicillin-resistant  ot(r) aeromonas strains over representatives of acinetobacter and escherichia coli within the hospital strain set. among the ot(r) mesophilic aeromonas strain  set, the global tolerance profiles of the two sites only differed in a higher number of kanamycin (kan) -tolerant strains (43%) for hospital aeromonads in comparison with the fishfarm aeromonads (8%). to some extent, this finding was correlated with the specific presence of aeromonas caviae dna hybridisation group (hg) 4. collectively, these results suggest that the profiles for amp and kan tolerance observed in both sites arose from taxonomic differences in the culturable ot(r) bacterial population at the generic or subgeneric level. in addition, our identification data also revealed that enterobacter sp., stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and a. veronii biovar sobria hg8 may be considered  potential indicator organisms to assess microbial tolerance in various compartments of the aquatic environment.

TI  == unique epidemiology of nosocomial urinary tract infection in children.
AB  == background: nosocomial urinary tract infection (nuti) occurs with varying frequency in children and is thought to be associated with urethral instrumentation. in response to changing infection control resources at our facility, we reviewed nuti to determine whether the frequency of nuti, associated complications, or presence of a remediable risk factor (instrumentation) justified ongoing routine infection control surveillance. methods: prospective surveillance was conducted on all wards 8 months per year from january 1991 through december 1997 by an infection control nurse coordinator. nuti was defined by laboratory evidence according to center for disease control and prevention definitions and detected 48 hours after admission. urinary catheterization in the previous 7 days was categorized as continuous/indwelling or intermittent. results: nuti was the fifth most common nosocomial infection (129/1375; approximately 9%) and decreased in frequency during the decade from 0.9 to approximately 0.6 cases/1000 patient days. incidence was equal among men and women. only 50% of cases had prior instrumentation of the urinary tract. nuti occurred disproportionately in newborns and infants (p <.001). the most common pathogen was escherichia coli (28%; 38/132), followed by candida sp (18%; 24/134), enterococcus (13%; 18/134), gram-negative nonfermenters (13%; 17/132), enterobacter (approximately 10%; 13/134), pseudomonas (9.7%; 13/134), and other (16%; 22/134). three cases of secondary bacteremia occurred (2.3%; 95% confidence interval 0.5-6.6); there was no mortality. conclusions: nuti poses a less significant burden of illness (incidence, associated morbidity) than other nosocomial infection in children. if resources do not permit hospital-wide surveillance, high-risk children with urethral instrumentation and newborns and infants could be targeted. although e coli remains the most common cause of pediatric nuti, fungi have become the second most common pathogen in this tertiary care population. risk factors for nuti in noncatheterized children remain to be delineated.

TI  == significance of fever in jamaican patients with homozygous sickle cell disease.
AB  == objective: to investigate the cause and outcome of high fever in jamaican children with homozygous sickle cell disease. design: retrospective review of febrile episodes in a three year period (1 september 1993 to 31 august 1996). setting: sickle cell clinic, an outpatient clinic in kingston run by the medical  research council laboratories (jamaica). patients: patients with homozygous sickle cell disease under 17 years of age presenting with an axillary temperature >/= 39.0 degrees c (102.4 degrees f). main outcome measures: diagnosis, death. results: there were 165 events in 144 patients (66 (45.8%) boys) with a median age of 6.1 years. bacteraemia was found in 10 (6.1%) events (three streptococcus  pneumoniae, two haemophilus influenzae type b, two salmonella sp, one escherichia coli, one enterobacter sp, and one acinetobacter sp), and urinary tract infections in four (2.4%). all cultures of cerebrospinal fluid were sterile. acute chest syndrome occurred in 36 (21.8%) events. a painful crisis was associated with 45 (27.3%) events and was the only pathology identified in 20 events (12.1%). hospital admission was necessary in 66 cases including all those  with bacteraemia and 31 with acute chest syndrome. there were two deaths: a 5 year old boy with septic shock associated with h influenzae septicaemia, and a 3  year old boy with the acute chest syndrome. conclusions: painful crisis and acute chest syndrome were the most common complications associated with high fever, but other important associated features included bacteraemia and urinary tract infection. enteric gram negative organisms accounted for 50% of positive blood cultures.

TI  == drug resistance in bacteria isolated from a brazilian hospital.
AB  == bacteria commonly associated with cases of hospital infection were isolated from  samples of food, from food handless, and from objects and surfaces from different places of a hospital in piracicaba, sao paulo, brazil, and the resistance patterns to antibiotic of these strains of bacteria were evaluated. the resistance patterns of these bacteria showed a large variation, and a high frequency of resistance to ampicillin (60.9%), cephalothin (58.7%) and carbenicillin (52.2%) was observed. the frequency of resistance to cephalosporins of 3rd and 4th-generations was 26.1% and 17.4% of the samples, respectively. resistance to more than two drugs was observed in 27 samples (56.5%), and in four strains multiple resistance to 17 or more tested drugs was recorded. five bacteria which were multi-resistant to antibiotics (enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, proteus sp, pseudomonas sp and staphylococcus aureus) were studied to determine the chromosomal or plasmidial genetic basis of the resistance, using plasmid curing and agarose gel electrophoresis of plasmidial dna. it was possible to verify that for the antibiotics chloramphenicol and kanamycin, the resistance seems to be of plasmidial origin.

TI  == cost-effective and rapid presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli in routine urine, pus, and stool cultures: evaluation of the use of chromagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests.
AB  == the algorithm for a new identification system was designed on the basis of colony color and morphology on chromagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests such as indole (ind), lysine decarboxylase (ldc), and ornithine decarboxylase (odc) utilization tests with gram-negative bacilli isolated from urine samples as well as pus, stool, and other clinical specimens by the following colony characteristics, biochemical reactions, and serological results: pinkish to red, ind positive (ind(+)), escherichia coli; metallic blue, ind(+), ldc(+), and odc negative (odc(-)), klebsiella oxytoca; ind(+), ldc(-), and odc(+), citrobacter diversus; ind(+) or ind(-), ldc(-), and odc(-), citrobacter freundii; ind(-), ldc(+), and odc(+), enterobacter aerogenes; ind(-), ldc(-), and odc(+), enterobacter cloacae; ind(-), ldc(+), and odc(-), klebsiella pneumoniae;  diffuse brown and ind(+), morganella morganii; ind(-), proteus mirabilis; aqua blue, serratia marcescens; bluish green and ind(+), proteus vulgaris; transparent yellow-green, serology positive, pseudomonas aeruginosa; clear and serology positive, salmonella sp.; other colors and reactions, the organism was identified by the full identification methods. the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of this new system were prospectively evaluated. during an 8-month period, a total of 345 specimens yielded one or more gram-negative bacilli. a total of 472 gram-negative bacillus isolates were detected on chromagar orientation medium. for 466 of the isolates (98.7%), no discrepancies in the results were obtained on the basis of the identification algorithm. the cost of identification of gram-negative bacilli during this period was reduced by about 70%. the results of this trial for the differentiation of the most commonly encountered gram-negative pathogens in clinical specimens with the new algorithm were favourable in that it permitted reliable detection and presumptive identification. in addition, this rapid identification system not only significantly reduced costs but it also improved the daily work flow within the clinical microbiology laboratory.

TI  == detection and distribution of insertion sequence 1 (is1)-containing bacteria in the freshwater environment(1).
AB  == the distribution of insertion sequence 1 (is1)-containing bacteria was investigated in windermere (cumbria, uk), a freshwater body impacted by treated sewage discharge and run-off from the surrounding catchment. culturable is1-containing bacteria were recovered from the water column at three depths in windermere north basin (wnb) and south basin (wsb), and from sediment at both sites (at the sediment surface in wsb and to a depth of 12-13 cm in wnb). polymerase chain reaction amplification of is1 and the escherichia coli/shigella  sp. specific gene uida, from community dna from shallow sediments, extended the detection limit beyond that of culture at both sites. this detection was extended further into deep sediment extracted from wnb as is1 and uida were detected in sub-samples to a depth of 4.7 and 2.3 m, respectively. analysis of a representative subset of 90 is1-carrying isolates recovered from water and sediment at both sites demonstrated 21 heterogeneous is1 profiles with estimated  copy numbers ranging from 1 to 16. identification of the host bacteria showed that the element was confined mainly to enterobacter spp. however, this study showed is1 to be present in citrobacter freundii for the first time. plasmids were carried by 75.3% of enterobacterial isolates and four plasmids (2.6%) carried is1. dna sequence analysis of five is1 clones demonstrated that is1 isoforms from this study were similar (>89% nucleotide identity) to known is1 isoforms. two isoforms of is1 from a single enterobacter cloacae isolate differed by 6.7% at the nucleotide level suggesting that they had been acquired independently.

TI  == use of oleic acid to reduce the population of the bacterial flora of poultry skin.
AB  == the effect of oleic acid on native bacterial flora of poultry skin was examined.  skin from commercial broiler carcasses was washed once or twice in solutions of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10% (wt/vol) oleic acid and rinsed in peptone water. aerobic bacteria, enterobacteriaceae, campylobacter, and enterococci in the rinsates were enumerated. significantly fewer aerobic bacteria, enterobacteriaceae, campylobacter, and enterococci were recovered from rinsates of skin washed in oleic acid than from control samples. additionally, fewer bacteria were recovered from rinsates of skin washed in higher concentrations of oleic acid than from skin washed in lower concentrations of the fatty acid. in most cases, there was no significant difference in the number of bacteria recovered from rinsates of skin washed once or twice in solutions of oleic acid. washing skin samples twice  in 10% solutions of oleic acid significantly reduced the number of aerobic bacteria, enterobacteriaceae, campylobacter, and enterococci that remained attached to the skin. campylobacter sp., enterococcus faecalis, and listeria monocytogenes isolates possessed the least resistance to the antibacterial activity of oleic acid in vitro, while escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed higher resistance. enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus lentus, and salmonella typhimurium had the greatest resistance to the antibacterial activity of oleic acid. findings indicate that oleic acid reduces the number of bacteria on the skin of processed broilers and that the fatty acid is bactericidal to several spoilage and pathogenic bacteria associated with poultry.

AB  == a blue-naped mousebird (urocolius macrourus) was diagnosed by gross necropsy and  histopathology as having a chronic, fibrosing bacterial cholecystitis. acute, severe, necrotizing pneumonia and myocarditis also were present with intralesional gram-negative bacteria. the bacteria within the lungs and heart were suspected to have spread from the biliary tract because of the pattern of distribution and similar gram-staining characteristics. enterobacter sp. and escherichia coli were cultured from the pulmonary lesions. cloacal cultures in clinically normal blue-naped mousebirds and speckled mousebirds (colius striatus) yielded both enterobacter sp. and e. coli. we hypothesize a pathogenesis in this  bird consisting of biliary stasis of unknown etiology and eventual infection of the biliary tract by the normal gram-negative gastrointestinal flora. death was believed to be a result of cardiac and respiratory dysfunction secondary to the bacterial dissemination from the biliary tree and endotoxemia.

AB  == clinical isolates collected from clinical facilities across japan in 1998 were tested against five aminoglycosides and three beta-lactams. the resistance of 50  strains each of methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., serratia sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus sp. (p. mirabilis 25 strains and p. vulgaris 25 strains) to the aminoglycosides isepamicin (isp), amikacin (amk), gentamicin, tobramycin and dibekacin, and to the beta-lactams imipenem, ceftazidime and piperacillin (all three known to be effective against p. aeruginosa) were investigated using a micro liquid dilution method with the following results: 1. isp was effective against all strains except for 14% of mrsa, 2% of proteus sp., and 4% of p. aeruginosa. 2. six strains of mrsa were resistant to all eight drugs; however, in these cases isp exhibited a relatively  low minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) compared to the other compounds. 3. four strains of mrsa were resistant to all drugs except isp. mrsa was the only isolate to demonstrate a resistance to seven or more drugs. 4. twenty-one strains of mrsa and 1 strain of p. aeruginosa were resistant to six drugs; however, all of these were susceptible to both isp and amk. 5. against all strains tested, isp generally exhibited a lower mic compared to amk. these results suggest that, even ten years after its entering the market, isp is still an aminoglycoside having a  high anti-bacterial activity against a wide range of clinical isolates.

AB  == objective: with the newer techniques of culture analysis such as the bactec 9240  fluorometric detection system, detecting bacteremia in the neonate may be possible in a significantly shorter time. we hypothesized that neonatal bacteremia can be detected in less than 48 hours by this method. study design: our study included a retrospective review of 613 blood cultures obtained during the period august 1, 1995 to march 18, 1996 taken from 325 infants who had cultures drawn with a sepsis work-up and/or repeat cultures who had initial positive cultures in our neonatal intensive care unit. results of blood cultures  were studied in conjunction with the variables of body weight, gestational age, organism grown, complete blood count (cbc), and timing of positive cultures. statistical analyses were performed using fisher's and two-tailed student's t tests. results: the results showed that of 325 infant blood cultures 49 (15%) were positive. of these, 64% were coagulase-negative staphylococci, 14% viridans  streptococci, 8% escherichia coli, 4% enterococcus sp., 4% pseudomonas sp., 2% enterobacter sp., 2% klebsiella sp., and 2% candida albicans. of the positive blood cultures taken from infants not on antibiotics at the time of culture, 54%  were detected positive at 18 hours, 71% at 24 hours, and 100% by 30 hours. detection time by organism type was as follows: coagulase-negative staphylococci, 21.7 hours; viridans streptococci, 15.6 hours; e. coli, 7.5 hours; enterococcus sp., 12 hours; enterobacter sp., 5 hours; klebsiella sp., 10 hours; and pseudomonas sp., 12 hours. conclusion: our results indicate that the bactec 9240  fluorometric detection system helps in early identification of neonatal bacteremia (in 24 to 30 hours), with gram-negative organisms being detected earlier than gram-positive organisms (p < 0.05) and having significantly higher immature neutrophils in a cbc (i:t ratio of > or = 0.2 (p < 0.001). early detection of neonatal bacteremia using this method will allow earlier diagnosis and appropriate treatment of the potentially bacteremic and bacteremic infant.

(34 samples), staphylococcus epidermis (22), yeasts (11), proteus sp. (11), pseudomonas sp. (11), klebsiella sp. (8), enterobacter sp. (6), citrobacter sp. (3), and acinetobacter sp. (1). the uropathogenic e. coli strains found were p-fimbriated, as demonstrated by hemoagglutination activity against human erythrocytes with and without mannose, sds-page of fimbrial proteins and transmission electron microscopy (tem). all e. coli strains found were exposed in vitro to sub-inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin (1/8 mic). our results showed that: 1) p-fimbriated e. coli is the most prevalent microorganism in acute uti (34%); 2) exposure to sub-mics of ciprofloxacin inhibits fimbrial production  in 79% of e. coli strains; 3) the pattern of sds-page fimbrial proteins is modified after exposure; in particular, the most affected synthesis involves the  protein at 18 kd known as p-fimbriae.

AB  == objective: to determine the pathogens associated with fulminant (lethal within 48 hours) late-onset sepsis (occurring after 3 days of age) in a neonatal intensive  care unit (nicu) and the frequency of fulminant late-onset sepsis for the most common pathogens. methods: a retrospective study was conducted of sepsis in infants in a nicu over a 10-year period (1988-1997). results: there were 825 episodes of late-onset sepsis occurring in 536 infants. thirty-four of 49 (69%; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 55%-82%) cases of fulminant late-onset sepsis were  caused by gram-negative organisms, including pseudomonas sp., 20 (42%); escherichia coli, 5 (10%); enterobacter sp., 4 (8%); and klebsiella sp., 4 (8%).  the frequency of fulminant sepsis was highest for pseudomonas sp., 20 of 36 (56%; 95% ci: 38%-72%) and lowest for coagulase-negative staphylococci, 4 of 277 (1%; 95%ci: 0%-4%). the very low frequency of fulminant sepsis caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci did not increase during the period when oxacillin was used instead of vancomycin as the empiric antibiotic for gram-positive organisms. conclusions: these data suggest that empiric antibiotics selected for treatment of suspected sepsis in infants >3 days old need to effectively treat gram-negative pathogens, particularly pseudomonas sp., because  these organisms, although less frequent, are strongly associated with fulminant late-onset sepsis in the nicu. avoiding empiric vancomycin therapy seemed to be a reasonable approach to late-onset sepsis, because of the very low frequency of fulminant sepsis caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci.

(2 per cent each). the bacterial isolates were relatively resistant to antibiotics traditionally employed to treat cases of septicaemia. the study shows a high prevalence of neonatal bacterial sepsis at the centre and the emerging role of listeria monocytogenes in the aetiology of neonatal sepsis. it highlights the preponderance of multiple antibiotic resistant organisms among these neonates early in life which is of epidemiological importance in the control of the infectious agents.

AB  == a novel pathogen from asian pears (pyrus pyrifolia nakai) was analysed by sequencing the 16s rdna and the adjacent intergenic region, and the data were compared to related enterobacteriaceae. the 16s rdna of the asian pear pathogen was almost identical with the sequence of erwinia amylovora, in contrast to the 16s-23s rrna intergenic transcribed spacer region of both species. a dendrogram was deduced from determined sequences of the spacer regions including those of several related species such as erwinia amylovora, enterobacter pyrinus, pantoea  stewartii subsp. stewartii and escherichia coli. dendrograms derived from 121 biochemical characteristics including biotype 100 data placed the asian pear pathogen close to erwinia amylovora and more distantly to other members of the species erwinia and to the species pantoea and enterobacter. another dna relatedness study was performed by dna hybridizations and estimation of delta tm  values. the asian pear strains constituted a tight dna hybridization group (89-100%) and were barely related to strains of erwinia amylovora (40-50%) with a delta tm in the range of 5.2-6.8. the g + c content of dna from the novel pathogen is 52 mol%. therefore, it is proposed that strains isolated from asian pears constitute a new species and the name erwinia pyrifoliae is suggested; the  type strain is strain ep 16/96t (= cfbp 4172t = dsm 12163t).

AB  == a genomic library of clostridium perfringens atcc 3626 was constructed in phage lambda gt11 and screened with an antibody against the c. perfringens azoreductase, which catalyzes the reduction of azo dyes to aromatic amines. a positive recombinant phage, containing a 3.8 kb dna fragment insert was selected  and purified. lytic and lysogenic escherichia coli cultures infected with the recombinant phage had higher azoreductase activity than cultures infected only with the vector lambda gt11. the 3.8 kb dna fragment was amplified by pcr and found to hybridize with one band from c. perfringens dna digested with ecor1, indicating the presence of a single copy of the azoreductase gene. the fragment also hybridized with dna from other azoreductase-producing clostridium species, a eubacterium sp., enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter amalonaticus and e. coli, but  not with dna from some other species of anaerobic bacteria capable of reducing azo dyes. the data indicate that the sequence of the azoreducatse gene of c. perfringens is conserved in some anaerobes and facultative anaerobes, but not in  others, and that different types of azoreductase genes must be found in other anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == isolation and characterization of acc deaminase genes from two different plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria.
AB  == we have recently proposed that one way that plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria  (pgpr) stimulate plant growth is through the activity of the enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (acc) deaminase, which causes a lowering of plant ethylene levels resulting in longer roots. as part of an effort to understand the role of this enzyme in pgpr, the genes for acc deaminase from two  pgpr, enterobacter cloacae cal2 and uw4, have been isolated. these genes are highly homologous to the acc deaminase genes from pseudomonas strains 6g5 and f17 and similar to the acc deaminase gene from pseudomonas sp. strain acp. the region downstream (i.e., at the 3'-terminal end) of the strain uw4 acc deaminase gene has a potential hairpin-like transcription termination site. the regions upstream of the strains uw4 and cal2 acc deaminase genes contain putative ribosome-binding sites; however, the promoter sequences have not yet been identified. southern hybridization experiments suggest that there is a single copy of the acc deaminase gene in enterobacter cloacae strains uw4 and cal2 and that there may be several different types of acc deaminase genes in different microbes. the cloned  acc deaminase gene can be expressed in escherichia coli enabling this bacterium to grow on acc as a sole source of nitrogen and confers upon both escherichia coli and pseudomonas spp. strains that are transformed with this gene the ability to promote the elongation of the roots of canola seedlings.

AB  == of the childhood urinary tract infections, more than 50% are caused by escherichia coli (e coli), followed by proteus mirabilis (p mirabilis), klebsiella sp, other enterobacteria, enterococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococci. of e coli isolates, 50 to 60% are resistant to ampicillin (ampi-r), 10% being susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (amc). for p mirabilis, ampi-r isolates are less frequent and more often susceptible to amc. klebsiella sp is resistant to ampicillin, 75% of isolates being susceptible to amc. in these three species, the susceptibility of isolates to third generation cephalosporins, aminogly-cosides, and ciprofloxacin is still high (> 90%), but 15 to 35% are resistant to cotrimoxazole. in the other enterobacteria (enterobacter  cloacae, morganella morganii, p vulgaris, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens) the resistance to cefalotin (hence to ampicillin and amc) is permanent, with an exception: the susceptibility of p vulgaris to amc. enterococci are mostly susceptible to ampicillin, and p aeruginosa to ceftazidime, but in both species, the percentage of resistant strains in hospitalised patients is greater than in outpatients. for staphylococcus aureus,  the community-acquired isolates are susceptible to oxacillin and other anti-staphylococcal agents. all the coagulase negative staphylococci isolates are susceptible to vancomycin, but 70% of those from hospitalised patients are resistant to oxacillin, aminoglycosides and cotrimoxazole.

TI  == bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with bloodstream infection: frequencies of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (united states and canada, 1997).
AB  == the sentry program was established in january 1997 to measure the predominant pathogens and antimicrobial resistance patterns of nosocomial and community-acquired infections over a broad network of sentinel hospitals in the united states (30 sites), canada (8 sites), south america (10 sites), and europe  (24 sites). during the first 6-month study period (january to june 1997), a total of 5,058 bloodstream infections (bsi) were reported by north american sentry participants (4,119 from the united states and 939 from canada). in both the united states and canada, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli were the most common bsi isolates, followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci. klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic streptococci were also among the 10  most frequently reported species in both the united states and canada. although the rank orders of pathogens in the united states and canada were similar, distinct differences were noted in the antimicrobial susceptibilities of several  pathogens. overall, u.s. isolates were considerably more resistant than those from canada. the differences in the proportions of oxacillin-resistant s. aureus  isolates (26.2 versus 2.7% for u.s. and canadian isolates, respectively), vancomycin-resistant enterococcal isolates (17.7 versus 0% for u.s. and canadian  isolates, respectively), and ceftazidime-resistant enterobacter sp. isolates (30.6 versus 6.2% for u.s. and canadian isolates, respectively) dramatically emphasize the relative lack of specific antimicrobial resistance genes (meca, vana, and vanb) in the canadian microbial population. among u.s. isolates, resistance to oxacillin among staphylococci, to vancomycin among enterococci, to  penicillin among pneumococci, and to ceftazidime among enterobacter spp. was observed in both nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens, although in almost  every instance the proportion of resistant strains was higher among nosocomial isolates. antimicrobial resistance continues to increase, and ongoing surveillance of microbial pathogens and resistance profiles is essential on national and international scales.

TI  == coliforms and salmonella in seawater near to domestic sewage sources in fortaleza (ceara, brazil).
AB  == the bacteriological conditions of the coastal region of fortaleza (ceara, brasil), including the coastal zones of the ceara and coco rivers, were examined. the study was conducted during june, september and december 1993, and march 1994. the region was divided into two areas: (i) direct influence area (dia), consisting of 20 sampling stations located near to discharge zones of the submarine pipeline system, where collections were carried out at the surface, and (ii) indirect influence area (iia), located near to the coastal zone, including barra do ceara, kartodromo, volta de jurema, mucuripe, farol and caca e pesca beaches, totalling 26 sampling stations. the most probable number (mpn) of both total and fecal coliforms in dia was positive only in station number 6, near to the sewage discharge exit. the following bacteria were identified: citrobacter sp., enterobacter aerogenes and escherichia coli. kartodromo beach was contaminated throughout the sampling period. results of total fecal mpn was essentially lower than 3.0 x 10(2) coliforms/100 ml at caca e pesca beach. in december, at both dia and iia, salmonella was identified in several samples. in dia, the spatial distribution for salmonella suggests that there should be a coastal sea current from east to west along the coastline. in iia, salmonella was identified at kartodromo and farol beaches throughout the sampling period.

TI  == results of quantitative cultures of urine by free catch and catheterization from  healthy adult horses.
AB  == quantitative urine cultures were performed on 11 male and 11 female healthy adult horses. urine was collected by free catch and catheterization using standard methods. results showed that all samples collected by free catch contained less than 20,000 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. all samples collected by catheterization contained 500 cfu/ml or less. a significant difference was found  between collection methods (p < .005), with catheterization having less contamination. in samples collected by free catch, females had significantly greater contamination than did males (p < .03). predominant bacterial species isolated included streptococcus spp., escherichia coli, enterobacter sp., bacillus sp., staphylococcus spp., diptheroids sp., proteus spp., and enterococcus sp. many samples contained multiple bacterial species. bacterial isolates were representative of the normal bacterial flora of the equine urogenital tract. this paper establishes reference values for quantitative urine  culture results in healthy adult horses to aid in the diagnosis of urinary tract  infections.

TI  == risk factors for developing peritonitis caused by micro-organisms of enteral origin in peritoneal dialysis patients.
AB  == objective: to investigate the risk factors associated with the development of peritonitis caused by enteral bacteria in peritoneal dialysis patients, including the prescription of gastric acid inhibitors as a potential risk factor. design: retrospective single-center study. setting: tertiary university hospital. patients and main outcome measures: fifty-five patients who entered into our continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (capd) program during the last 6 years  were included. multiple logistic regression analysis was used to establish the best determinants over the development of at least one episode of enteric peritonitis. the predictive variables included in the model were: age, gender, diabetic versus nondiabetic, polycystic versus nonpolycystic kidney diseases, history of constipation, presence or absence of moderate/severe malnutrition, peritoneal transport characteristics, peritoneal protein losses, rate of exit-site infections, rate of total peritonitis, intestinal abnormalities, and treatment with inhibitors of gastric acid secretion. results: the total number of peritonitis episodes during the studied period was 88, which clustered in 34 of 55 patients. fourteen (16%) were caused by enteric micro-organisms in 10 patients: escherichia coli (6), klebsiella sp (2), enterobacter sp (1), and enterococcus sp (5). nine of 10 patients who developed enteric peritonitis were on gastric acid inhibitors (3 patients on omeprazole and 6 patients on h2-antagonists), while 15 of 45 patients who did not develop enteric peritonitis  were on gastric acid inhibitors (all of them on h2-blockers). there were temporal relationships between the start of gastric acid inhibitors and the development of enteric peritonitis in 6 of 9 patients who were on this medication. four of 10 patients who developed enteric peritonitis had diverticulosis. ten of 45 patients who did not develop enteric peritonitis had been diagnosed with diverticulosis of the colon or sigmoid prior to entry to capd. the unique patient who was not on gastric acid inhibitors and developed enteric peritonitis, had been diagnosed with chronic atrophic gastritis with achlorhydria. by multiple logistic regression analysis, the treatment with gastric acid inhibitors was the only independent variable that entered into the best predictive equation over the development of enteric peritonitis (log likelihood ratio = -26.077, odds ratio =  18; 95% ci odds ratio: 2 - 155). conclusion: gastric acid inhibitors may increase the risk for developing enteric peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients.

TI  == bacterial isolates from indigenous weaning foods in rural ethiopian setting, jimma zone, south west ethiopia.
AB  == a community based bacteriological study of weaning foods was conducted from november 1994 to august 1995 in six peasant associations, jimma zone. the households in the study community were found to be in poor sanitary conditions with cattle and pets living in the same room with humans, and the community gets  water from unprotected sources. the predominant weaning foods in the study community were cereals. these and other foods given to weaning age children were  found to be grossly contaminated, aerobic mesophilic bacterial counts being 10(5) cfu/ml of sample. the most frequent bacterial isolates were enterobacter sp, gram positive cocci including staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella sp., citrobacter sp.,  and escherichia coli in that order. various factors such as unsafe water, unhygienic handling of food, storage of food at ambient temperature for a long time, poor domestic and personal hygiene may have contributed for the gross contamination of weaning foods in the study community. this calls for educating the community on the relationship between contamination of weaning foods and diarrhoeal diseases, and promoting measures such as reheating of weaning foods which have been kept at ambient temperature for a long time before serving infants and children.

AB  == objective: evaluation of the in vitro activity of new fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins and carbapenems against gram-negative bacteria. material and method: a total of 569 clinical isolates were obtained from inpatients at sao paulo hospital--unifesp/epm in june and july of 1992. the species distribution was as follows: enterobacter sp. (62), escherichia coli (308), klebsiella pneumoniae (27), klebsiella sp. (9), proteus mirabilis (23), pseudomonas aeruginosa (88), pseudomonas sp. (4), serratia sp. (30) and other gram-negatives  (7). susceptibility tests were performed by broth microdilution. the antimicrobials agents tested were: ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, du 6859-alpha, ceftazidime, cefepime, fk 037, imipenem, meropenem  and biapenem. results: du 6859-alpha showed the highest anti-microbial activity among the fluoroquinolones. it was two- to four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against some species. the potency and antimicrobial spectrum were similar between the fourth-generation cephalosporins against enterobacteriaceae,  except for enterobacter sp. strains which were more susceptible to cefepime than  they were to cefetazidime or fk 037. when testing pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftazidime was slightly more active than the other cephalosporins. against enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, meropenem was more active  than imipenem or biapenem. in addition, the percentage of strains, susceptible to meropenem was higher than the percentage susceptible to the other cerbapenems against these species. conclusion: the new antimicrobial agents demonstrated in vitro activity higher than that of agents commercially available. however, more studies are necessary to further evaluate the in vivo activity and the clinical benefit of these compounds.

TI  == isolation of an acanthamoeba strain with intracellular burkholderia pickettii infection.
AB  == burkholderia pickettii is a facultative pathogen that has been isolated from patient sources and environmental sources including respiratory therapy solutions, deionized water and aqueous disinfectants. the organism has been associated with septicemia and respiratory tract infections. in our investigation, burkholderia pickettii (biovar 2) was for the first time isolated  from acanthamoeba sp. (group ii), a free living amoeba species recovered from the wet area of a physiotherapy unit. pathogenic strains of acanthamoebae may cause amoebic-encephalitis (ae) and keratitis. light and electron microscopic examinations showed that in a first step, the bacterial were phagocytized by the  amoebae. in contrast to enterobacter cloacae and escherichia coli that were used  as food organisms and digested within food vacuoles, burkholderia pickettii caused the amoebae to develop large vacuoles filled with completely intact and motile bacteria. 3-5 days after infection, pseudomonas pickettii had multiplied within the enlarging parasitophorous vacuoles. ultrastructural changes in the host cells occurred and the amoebae finally underwent rupture or lysis. in cocultivation assays we could not only reinfect the original host amoeba but acanthamoeba strains from other habitats could successfully be infected with burkholderia pickettii as well.

TI  == nosocomial infections among neonates in high-risk nurseries in the united states. national nosocomial infections surveillance system.
AB  == background: nosocomial infections result in considerable morbidity and mortality  among neonates in high-risk nurseries (hrns). purpose: to examine the epidemiology of nosocomial infections among neonates in level iii hrns. methods:  data were collected from 99 hospitals with hrns participating in the national nosocomial infections surveillance system, which uses standard surveillance protocols and nosocomial infection site definitions. the data included information on maternal acquisition of and risk factors for infection, such as device exposure, birth weight category (< or = 1000, 1001 through 1500, 1501 through 2500, and > 2500 g), mortality, and the relationship of the nosocomial infection to death. results: from october 1986 through september 1994, these hospitals submitted data on 13 179 nosocomial infections. the bloodstream was the most frequent site of nosocomial infection in all birth weight groups. nosocomial pneumonia was the second most common infection site, followed by the gastrointestinal and eye, ear, nose, and throat sites. the most common nosocomial pathogens among all neonates were coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, enterobacter sp, and escherichia coli. group  b streptococci were associated with 46% of bloodstream infections that were maternally acquired; coagulase-negative staphylococci were associated with 58% of bloodstream infections that were not maternally acquired, most of which (88%) were associated with umbilical or central intravenous catheters. conclusions: bloodstream infections, the most frequent nosocomial infections in all birth weight groups, should be a major focus of surveillance and prevention efforts in  hrns. for bloodstream infections, stratification of surveillance data by maternal acquisition will help focus prevention efforts for group b streptococci outside the hrn. within the nursery, bloodstream infection surveillance should focus on umbilical or central intravenous catheter use, a major risk factor for infection.

(4), escherichia coli (3), group d streptococcus (11) and bacteroides sp. (6). all enterobacteria tested were sensitive to chloramphenicol, aminoglycosides and cefotaxime. group d streptococci were sensitive to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and penicillin g, whereas anaerobic bacteria were sensitive to chloramphenicol and tetracycline. these results suggest that in cases of abscess formation secondary to bothrops bite, chloramphenicol alone is a good choice, being both safe and cheap.

AB  == acanthamoeba were isolated from a naturally occurring animal infection of granulomatous amebic encephalitis. the amebas were grown from lung lesions from a 1-year-old greyhound puppy, which was 1 of several dogs in a kennel that was affected by a progressive fatal neurologic and respiratory disease. the centers for disease control, atlanta, georgia, confirmed the disease to be acanthamebiasis and specifically identified the amebas as acanthamoeba culbertsoni by fluorescent antibody testing on brain tissue from the dog. the amebas were cultured initially on potato dextrose agar and on nonnutrient agar plates that were seeded with a lawn of nonpathogenic escherichia coli. the isolate was then transferred to nonnutrient agar plates containing killed enterobacter aerogenes and subsequently to axenic medium and cell cultures. the isolate was highly pathogenic by intranasal inoculation into 2-week-old mice.

TI  == analysis of polar lipids from some representative enterobacteria, plesiomonas and acinetobacter by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry.
AB  == fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (fab-ms) was used to analyse lipid extracts of bacteria to assess its usefulness for analysing anionic phospholipids of potential chemotaxonomic value. the following micro-organisms were tested: acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae (2 strains), escherichia coli (3 strains), hafnia alvei, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, plesiomonas shigelloides, proteus mirabilis (3 strains), serratia liquefaciens and serratia marcescens. negative-ion spectra provide data for twenty-seven major carboxylate  anions (m/z 209-325) and for thirty-seven major phospholipid anions (m/z 645-774). generally, the largest carboxylate peaks were due to 16:1, 16:0, cyc17  and 18:1 while the largest phospholipid anion peaks were due to pe(32:1), pe(33:1), pe(34:1), pe(34:2), pg(30:2), pg(31:2), pg(32:2), pg(34:1) and ps(33:0). however, quantitative differences were observed. for example, acinetobacter lacked pe (33:1) but had exceptionally high peaks at m/z 748, ps(33:0), and m/z 281, octadecanoate. unknown 'carboxylate' peaks were detected at m/z 254, 256, 261, 268, 282 and 301. in some cases, unknown peaks appeared to  constitute possible homologous series being separated by delta m/z of 14(identical to methylene). for chemotaxonomic purposes, the complexity of the data required numerical analysis. using the pearson coefficient of linear correlation, as a measure of association, it was possible to compare all strains  analysed. typical results for strain comparisons were as follows: ent. cloacae vs ent. cloacae, r = 0.90 (ent. cloacae vs ac. calcoaceticus, r = 0.46). thus fab-ms represents an excellent means of obtaining large quantities of data on polar lipids of a range of bacterial isolates, which may be suitable for chemotaxonomic purposes.

TI  == mobilization of nonconjugative pbr322-derivative plasmids from laboratory strains of escherichia coli to bacteria isolated from seawater.
AB  == mobilization of derivatives of plasmids pbr322 and pbr325 was shown to occur between escherichia coli k12 strains in lb-broth at 37 degrees c, provided a mobilizer plasmid (f') was present either together with the nonconjugative plasmid or in a second donor strain. evidence from restriction endonuclease analysis suggested that the mobilization was facilitated by a transposition phenomenon involving the "gamma-delta" sequence of f'. it was shown that mobilization of a derivative of pbr325 from e. coli k12 to bacteria isolated from seawater occurred in incubations in both lb-broth and filtered seawater and that  pseudomonas sp., enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella oxytoca, e. coli, and citrobacter amalonaticus isolates were recipient-active.

TI  == [desiccated rattlesnake capsules: a potential source of gram-negative bacterial infection].
AB  == the ingestion of rattlesnake powder capsules is frequent in mexico in view of their alleged curative properties in various diseases, among them different malignancies. based on previous reports showing both bacteremia and septicemia in patients with malignant diseases ingesting such capsules, we conducted a study to evaluate the presence of microorganisms in 16 different preparations of rattlesnake powder capsules, obtained in six different cities of our country. we  found that all the samples were significantly contaminated with gram-negative coliform bacteria: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter agglomerans, e. cloacae, salmonella arizona and salmonella of groups b, e4 and g. eighty one percent of the capsules were contaminated with salmonella sp. the most frequent was s. arizona with a natural reservoir in snakes. contamination was probably derived from both the flesh of the snake and fecal contamination during  the domestic preparation of the powder to produce the capsules. these data, together with those previously published regarding bacteremia and septicemia derived from the ingestion of the capsules, suggests that there is danger in their use.

TI  == aminoglycosides versus beta-lactams in gram-negative pneumonia.
AB  == newer beta-lactam antibiotics with high levels of activity against gram-negative  aerobic bacilli (including pseudomonas aeruginosa) such as cefoperazone, ceftazidime, imipenem, and aztreonam may be suitable for monotherapy of gram-negative pneumonia. aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin are also highly active against these same organisms and have been more extensively used, but are both ototoxic and nephrotoxic. key therapeutic questions are whether beta-lactams can safely replace aminoglycosides for the treatment of gram-negative pneumonia, and whether monotherapy or aminoglycoside and beta-lactam combination antibiotic treatment is superior. there is remarkably little definitive clinical data in the literature to answer these questions, but  available studies suggest that beta-lactam monotherapy may be adequate for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonias, but that combination therapy may be preferred for pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia sp, enterobacter sp, and acinetobacter sp, largely based on rates of bacterial persistence and emergence of resistance. at this time, there are more data available to support aminoglycoside monotherapy than beta-lactam monotherapy in gram-negative pneumonia and remarkably little data to suggest superiority of two antibiotics over single agents when they have been compared prospectively. thus, combination  therapy remains a conservative recommendation until better studies are available.

TI  == oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  == two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (peptostreptococcus (1); eubacterium (9); clostridium (6); veillonella (6); megasphera (1); bacteroides (28); fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (p. anaerobius (1); e. fossor (9); c. villosum (1); b. fragilis (1); b. tectum (2); b. heparinolyticus (2)). three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (lrt) or paraoral (po) bacterial infections. of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. among the obligately anaerobic species, gram-positive cocci including p. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, e. fossor 11% and other gram-positive rods (excluding  clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. the gram-negative rods comprised b. fragilis 5%, b. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented bacteroides 3% and other bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of fusobacterium (7%), and gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by pasteurella spp. 19%, escherichia coli 17%, actinomyces spp. 9%, streptococcus spp. 9%. incidental facultative isolates were enterococcus spp. 2%, enterobacter cloaceae 2%, actinobacillus spp. 2% and gram-negative corroding rods 5%. on the basis of the similarities (as determined by dna hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. e. fossor and b. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and lrt and po diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.

AB  == febrile neutropenic patients were randomized to receive ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin with the addition of teicoplanin in cases with clinical suspicion of a hickman line-associated infection. at 48 h both clinical and bacteriological analyses were made. patients were categorized as: success, in cases of improvement or stability in the clinical condition; failure, if there was a deterioration of the clinical condition; and non-evaluable, in cases of protocol  violation or death due to other causes. a total of 86 patients have completed the study so far; 43 patients were randomized to the ceftazidime and 43 to the ciprofloxacin group. teicoplanin was added to the monotherapy in 12 patients in the ceftazidime group and 15 in the ciprofloxacin group. the diagnoses were: acute myelogenous leukaemia (25), non-hodgkin's lymphoma (34), hodgkin's disease  (17); acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (9) and chronic granulocytic leukaemia (1). forty-eight hour clinical assessment showed a response rate in the ceftazidime group of: success 18/31 (58%), failure 13/31 (42%); in the ceftazidime and teicoplanin group: success 8/12 (67%), failure 4/12 (33%); in the ciprofloxacin group: success 23/28 (82%), failure 5/28 (18%); and in the ciprofloxacin and teicoplanin group: success 11/15 (73%), failure 4/15 (27%). blood cultures were positive in 48/86 (56%) cases, with more than one organism isolated in seven of these 48 cases. organisms isolated were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (20), escherichia coli (13), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), staphylococcus aureus (3), diphtheroids (3), klebsiella sp. (3), enterobacter cloacae (2), streptococcus faecalis (2), ent. adenocarboxylata (1), clostridium septicum (1). strept. b (1), alpha streptococcus (1) and p. fluorescens (1), in-vitro testing showed that all  gram-positive organisms were sensitive to teicoplanin, and gram-negative organisms to ciprofloxacin or ceftazidime. there were seven cases of superimposed infections with eight organisms isolated, all cases occurring in patients receiving ciprofloxacin alone: coagulase-negative staphylococci (4), strep. sangius (1), strep. viridans (1), diphtheroids (1) and p. maltophilia (1). both ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime are comparable in efficacy as empirical monotherapy for febrile neutropenic patients. there is, however, a significant increase in the incidence of superimposed infection in patients receiving only ciprofloxacin. in view of the very high incidence of gram-positive septicaemia, we suggest that  teicoplanin should be added as part of the initial empiric antibiotic regimen in  all febrile neutropenic patients.

AB  == all serratia marcescens strains (total of 33) of different sources were hemolytic including clinical strains previously classified as being nonhemolytic. dna fragments of the two hemolysin genes hybridized with the chromosomal dna of s. marcescens, s. liquefaciens, s. kiliensis, s. grimesii, s. proteamaculans, s. plymutica, s. rubridaea which were also hemolytic. the restriction pattern of the hemolysin locus differed in each strain. s. ficaria and s. marinorubra expressed  a different hemolysin which was much smaller than the s. marcescens hemolysin since it diffused through dialysis membranes. the dna of the latter strains did not hybridize with the s. marcescens hemolysin dna probes. some s. marcescens strains, s. kiliensis and s. liquefaciens also expressed in addition the small hemolysin. no hybridization was found with dna of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella arerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosus, listeria sp.,  aeromonas sp., legionella sp. and a meninococcus sp., indicating that the hemolysin dna probes are specific for serratia, or that the hemolysin genes occur rarely in genera other than serratia.

TI  == ciprofloxacin in patients with bacteremic infections. the spanish group for the study of ciprofloxacin.
AB  == the efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of 68 episodes of bacteremia were studied. patients were treated intravenously (30 cases), orally (13 cases), or with sequential intravenous/oral therapy (25 cases). intravenous doses ranged from 200 to 400 mg per day and oral doses ranged from 1,000 to 1,500 mg per day. according to the criteria of mccabe and jackson, 39 cases had nonfatal and 29 had ultimately fatal underlying diseases. the clinical condition  of patients at the start of therapy was critical or poor in 40 cases and fair or  good in 28. sixty-four of the 68 episodes of bacteremia were monomicrobial and the remaining four were polymicrobial. the causative micro-organisms were: escherichia coli (18 episodes), pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 episodes), acinetobacter sp. (10 episodes), salmonella sp. (seven episodes), enterobacter sp. (six episodes), proteus sp. (four episodes), serratia sp. (four episodes), haemophilus influenzae (three episodes), klebsiella sp. (three episodes), staphylococcus aureus (2 episodes), and morganella morganii (two episodes). overall clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin was 94 percent (64 of 68 patients). bacteremia persisted in four patients (failure rate of 6 percent). five organisms persisted: acinetobacter sp. (two patients), p. aeruginosa (one patient), enterobacter sp. (one patient), and serratia sp. (one patient). side effects were phlebitis associated with intravenous administration (four cases), dizziness (four cases), and superinfection (six cases). superinfecting organisms and sites  were as follows: enterococcus faecalis, wound (2 cases); candida sp., urinary tract infection (one case); acinetobacter anitratus (ciprofloxacin resistant), urinary tract infection (one case); staphylococcus epidermidis, blood (one case); and clostridium perfringens, blood (one case). ciprofloxacin administered either  intravenously, orally, or intravenously followed by the oral route is effective therapy in the treatment of severe bacteremic infections.

TI  == ticarcillin/clavulanate in the treatment of severe peritonitis.
AB  == a prospective study was performed on 50 consecutive patients with secondary peritonitis. all patients received ticarcillin/clavulanate 5.2 g three times daily as initial antibiotic therapy. in 30 patients a primary perforation was found in the gastro-intestinal tract and 20 had post-operative peritonitis. in two thirds of the patients a diffuse peritonitis was found which affected the whole abdomen. thirty-six patients underwent one or two laparotomies and 11 patients had more than three laparotomies. subsequently, 17 patients died. the cause of death was a therapeutic failure as a result of the surgical procedure in ten patients (nine patients with persisting intestinal fistulae, one patient with bleeding), whereas in seven cases antibiotic therapy failed. micro-organisms found in the latter patients were producers of type 1 beta-lactamase (pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter sp., citrobacter sp., serratia marcescens) and enterococci. ticarcillin/clavulanate is characterized by its broad antimicrobial  spectrum against anaerobic and aerobic bacteria and seems, therefore, to be well  suited for initial chemotherapy in patients with diffuse peritonitis.

AB  == twenty cultures comprising 13 clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae from two  hospitals, the type and another reference stain of e. cloacae and the type strains of four other enterobacter sp. and of escherichia coli, were characterized by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) of whole-cell proteins. the protein patterns were highly reproducible and were used as the basis of a numerical analysis which divided the clinical isolates into nine clearly defined protein types. comparison with established typing methods indicated that the discrimination of sds-page was similar to that achieved with conventional typing methods and all strain groups recognized by combined sero/phage typing were also found by sds-page. in addition, protein typing sub-divided a group of four serotype o3 isolates that were difficult to distinguish by phage typing. we conclude that high-resolution sds-page of proteins provides an effective method of typing isolates of e. cloacae.

TI  == [studies on 145 cases of septicemia in infancy and childhood--especially on septicemic patients with malignant and hematological diseases].
AB  == clinical and bacteriological data of 145 inpatients with septicemia, treated at the hospital of chiba university school of medicine from 1972 to 1987, were reviewed by dividing them into three stages. (stages i: 1972-76, stage ii: 1978-82, stage iii: 1983-87) patients with underlying diseases have been increasing: 91.8% of the total patients in stage iii. among the patients with underlying diseases, malignant and hematological diseases occupied about 60%, and in the other diseases, congenital heart diseases have been increasing in number.  as to the organisms isolated, gram positive bacteria have increased, while gram negative bacteria have decreased. in stage iii, the rate of gram positive organisms and gram negative ones accounted for 43.1% and 41.2% of all the isolates from the septic patients with malignant & hematological diseases, respectively. in patients with malignant & hematological diseases, alpha-streptococcus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, and fusobacterium sp. have been increasing, whereas, escherichia coli, enterobacter sp., klebsiella sp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa decreasing. in patients with other underlying diseases, s. aureus, cns, and non fermenters have been increasing. among the patients without underlying diseases, gram positive bacteria accounted for the major part. the decrease of gram negative organisms in patients with malignant and hematological diseases may partially depend on the introduction of polymixin  b as the drug of gut decontamination. the outcome of septicemia in the patients with malignant & hematological diseases has been markedly improving through all the three stages. during stage iii, episode mortality and case mortality rate proved to be 23% and 31%, respectively. the introduction of the third generation  cephems has decreased the mortality rate for gram negative organisms and contributed to the improvement of the total prognosis. the prognosis was worst in the case of p. aeruginosa, showing a mortality rate of 50% during stage iii. coincidence rate of blood and other cultures have been largest in the case of p.  aeruginosa, so, the drug sensitivity of the strain cultured from other sites is sometimes useful in the choice of antibiotics.

TI  == castor-oil induced diarrhoea in ponies: a model for acute colitis.
AB  == a reproducible, reversible model of colitis induced in ponies by administering castor oil (2.5 ml/kg bodyweight [bwt] per os) was characterised by abdominal pain, fever, watery diarrhoea, dehydration, hypovolaemia, toxaemia, leucopenia, decreased serum cl, na and k levels and metabolic acidosis. the signs were most severe between 24 and 48 h post induction, stabilisation was frequently observed  after 72 h, although diarrhoea could persist beyond 96 h. morphological and in vitro transport studies (right ventral colon) were conducted on tissues from animals destroyed at 24, 48 and 72 h. in the caecum and colon, surface epithelial disruption and exfoliation from the basement membrane occurred between 24 and 48  h. early signs of recovery were evident by replenishment of denuded areas with columnar epithelium at 72 h. the crypt epithelium was unaffected throughout the intestinal tract. in vitro transport studies were consistent with the morphological findings. decreased na-cl absorption and normal cl secretion indicated an impaired surface epithelium coincident with an undamaged cryptal epithelium. increased mucosal permeability was demonstrated by high ionic conductance and large unidirectional isotopic fluxes. tissue conductance improved during in vitro incubation suggesting epithelial repair after removal of castor oil. changes in the population and proportion of bacteria in the faeces as diarrhoea ensued were confirmed at necropsy with a predominance of e. coli and enterobacter/klebsiella sp in the large bowel. the experimental induction of castor oil colitis showed many similarities to intestinal endotoxaemia and the secretory type diarrhoea encountered in naturally occurring acute colitis syndromes in horses. the model could prove applicable in studying the pathophysiological mechanisms precipitating such life-threatening disorders.

TI  == product of the lactococcus lactis gene required for malolactic fermentation is homologous to a family of positive regulators.
AB  == malolactic fermentation is a secondary fermentation that many lactic acid bacteria can carry out when l-malate is present in the medium. the activation of  the malolactic system in lactococcus lactis is mediated by a locus we call mler.  induction of the genes necessary to perform malolactic fermentation occurs only in bacteria with a functional copy of mler. the mler gene consists of one open reading frame capable of coding for a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 33,813 daltons. the amino acid sequence of the predicted mler gene product is homologous to that of positive activators in gram-negative bacteria: lysr, ilvy gene products of escherichia coli, metr, cysb of salmonella typhimurium, ampr of  enterobacter cloacae, nodd of rhizobium sp., and trpi of pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == antibacterial activity of tigemonam dicholate (sq 30836) and interaction with beta-lactamases of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == sq 30836 is an orally absorbed salt of tigemonam, a new monobactam similar to aztreonam in structure and microbiologic properties. when assayed against 400 clinical isolates, tigemonam's activity was similar to that of aztreonam and carumonam. it was highly effective against enterobacteriaceae but showed poor activity against gram-positive organisms. it inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella, shigella, yersinia, proteus, providencia, and morganella strains at 0.5 micrograms/ml or less, and all salmonella and hafnia strains at 1 micrograms/ml or less. citrobacter, enterobacter, and serratia strains were less  susceptible (minimum inhibitory concentrations [mic30] of 2, 32, and 8 micrograms/ml respectively). the activity of the new compound against enterobacteriaceae is comparable with and often higher than that of third-generation cephalosporins and oral comparison compounds. in contrast to aztreonam, tigemonam had minimal activity against pseudomonas sp and glucose nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria. data suggest that poor penetration through  the outer membranes of pseudomonas sp may be responsible for this failure. tigemonam was stable to hydrolysis by plasmid-mediated and chromosomal beta-lactamases. it was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the kl enzyme of klebsiella and by the proteus vulgaris beta-lactamase. also, measurement of the ic50 (concentration of inhibitor able to reduce the activity of the enzyme by 59%) showed that tigemonam has less affinity than aztreonam for class i cephalosporinases. however, only levels of beta-lactamase, not hydrolysis rates or affinity, correlated to mics of the two monobactams for the resistant enterobacter and citrobacter strains.

AB  == the susceptibility of coliform bacteria and bacterial pathogens to free chlorine  residuals was determined before and after incubation with amoebae and ciliate protozoa. viability of bacteria was quantified to determine their resistance to free chlorine residuals when ingested by laboratory strains of acanthamoeba castellanii and tetrahymena pyriformis. cocultures of bacteria and protozoa were  incubated to facilitate ingestion of the bacteria and then were chlorinated, neutralized, and sonicated to release intracellular bacteria. qualitative susceptibility of protozoan strains to free chlorine was also assessed. protozoa  were shown to survive and grow after exposure to levels of free chlorine residuals that killed free-living bacteria. ingested coliforms escherichia coli,  citrobacter freundii, enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca and bacterial pathogens salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella sonnei, legionella gormanii, and campylobacter jejuni had increased resistance to free chlorine residuals. bacteria could be cultured from within treated protozoans well after the time required for 99% inactivation of free-living cells. all bacterial pathogens were  greater than 50-fold more resistant to free chlorine when ingested by t. pyriformis. escherichia coli ingested by a cyclidium sp., a ciliate isolated from a drinking water reservoir, were also shown to be more resistant to free chlorine. the mechanism that increased resistance appeared to be survival within  protozoan cells. this study indicates that bacteria can survive ingestion by protozoa. this bacterium-protozoan association provides bacteria with increased resistance to free chlorine residuals which can lead to persistence of bacteria in chlorine-treated water. we propose that resistance to digestion by predatory protozoa was an evolutionary precursor of pathogenicity in bacteria and that today it is a mechanism for survival of fastidious bacteria in dilute and inhospitable aquatic environments.

TI  == clinical safety and efficacy of ofloxacin.
AB  == in this study we report about the efficacy and tolerability of ofloxacin in the treatment of 15 patients with severe and moderately severe infections including osteomyelitis (5), soft tissue infections (5), salmonellosis in aids patients (2), acute or chronic pulmonary infections (2) and mediastinitis (1). the following organisms were isolated in culture specimens: staphylococcus aureus (4), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), staphylococcus epidermidis (3), serratia marcescens (1), escherichia coli (1), aeromonas hydrophila (1), klebsiella oxytoca (1), klebsiella pneumoniae (1), salmonella cholerae-suis (1), salmonella  sp. (1), enterobacter cloacae (1). all isolates were sensitive to the drug. of 5  cases with osteomyelitis, 2 were cured and 3 improved clinically (with bacteriological eradication of the pathogens). the best results were obtained in  patients with soft tissue infections: 4 patients were cured and 1 improved. two patients with salmonella bacteremia and aids experienced a recurrence 1 month and 2 months respectively after stopping therapy. the patient with mediastinitis was  successfully treated. improvement was recorded for 2 patients with bronchiectasis and exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. the drug was well tolerated, only one episode of mild nausea and vomiting was reported and did not require discontinuation of the therapy. the study indicates that ofloxacin is a safe and  effective agent in the treatment of various infections.

TI  == efficacy and safety of cefpirome (hr810).
AB  == sixty adult patients with suspected systemic bacterial infections were treated with cefpirome 1 g or 2 g twice daily for 5-22 days. forty-seven patients were evaluable for clinical efficacy. diagnoses in evaluable patients were urinary tract infections (20), pneumonia (10), soft tissue infections (17), and bone and  joint infections (4); four patients had two infections each. nine patients were bacteraemic and all were cured; the responsible bacteria were escherichia coli (6), streptococcus pneumoniae (1), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), and haemophilus influenzae (1). one patient with a soft tissue infection failed to respond clinically to cefpirome. bacteriologically, 41 of 48 isolated pathogens (85%) were eradicated. in wound cultures, three strains of staphylococcus aureus and one each of ps. aeruginosa and str. faecalis persisted. one enterobacter sp. relapsed in urine. of isolated strains, only str. faecalis and methicillin resistant staph, epidermidis were resistant to cefpirome. staph, aureus strains were inhibited in vitro by 0.25 to 2 mg/l of cefpirome in agar dilution. adverse  effects, probably or possibly related to cefpirome, were skin reactions (3), fever (1), clostridium difficile diarrhoea (2), and disturbed taste sensation (1). tolerance was good. cefpirome is suitable for large-scale comparative trials.

AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial potencies of ky-109, a pro-drug of ky-087, were compared with those of amoxicillin, cephalexin (cex), and cefaclor (ccl). the following results were obtained. ky-087, which is the active form of ky-109,  had broad antimicrobial spectrum against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, but showed low antimicrobial activity against enterobacter sp., serratia, and pseudomonas sp. the antimicrobial activities of ky-087 against clinically isolated gram-positive organisms were superior to those of cex and ccl. the antimicrobial activities of ky-087 against gram-negative organisms, such as enterobacter sp., serratia, and pseudomonas sp., were less active. ky-087 showed dose-related bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. the therapeutic efficacy of ky-109 against experimental intraperitoneal infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative organisms in mice was comparable to that of cex but inferior to that of ccl. in experimental granuloma pouch models in rats and kidney infection in rabbits, therapeutic efficacy of ky-109 was either comparable or superior to that of cex and ccl.

TI  == lipid a precursor from pseudomonas aeruginosa is completely acylated prior to addition of 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate.
AB  == inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (lps) synthesis in pseudomonas aeruginosa at the stage of incorporation of 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate (kdo) caused accumulation  of a lipid a precursor which contained all of the fatty acids present on the lipid a of mature lps. the enzyme ctp:cmp-3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate cytidylyltransferase (cmp-kdo synthetase) from p. aeruginosa is inhibited by the  kdo analog alpha-c-[1,5-anhydro-8-amino-2,7,8-trideoxy-d-manno-octopyranosyl] carboxylate (i), and i is effectively delivered to p. aeruginosa following attachment by amide linkage to the carboxyl terminus of alanylalanine. intracellular hydrolysis releases the free inhibitor (i) which then inhibits activation of kdo by cmp-kdo synthetase causing accumulation of lipid a precursor and subsequent growth stasis. the major lipid a precursor species accumulated was purified and found to contain glucosamine, phosphate, c12:o, 2oh-c12:o and 3oh-c10:0 (in ester linkage), and 3oh-c12:0 (in amide linkage) in molar ratios of 1:1:0.5:0.5:1:1. analysis of precursor by fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy yielded a major ion (m - h)- of mass 1616 and fragments which were consistent with the structure of lipid a from p. aeruginosa. in contrast, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, citrobacter sp., serratia marcescens, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae all accumulated underacylated lipid a precursors which only contained 3-oh-c14:0, glucosamine, and phosphate. this difference and species-specific patterns of major and minor precursor species show that early steps in the assembly of lipid a are similar, but not identical in enteric and nonenteric gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == carumonam's in-vitro activity against gram-negative bacteria and its stability to their beta-lactamases.
AB  == the in vitro activity of the novel monobactam carumonam (ro17-2301) was evaluated on 311 gram-negative clinical isolates in comparison to aztreonam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefotetan and ceftriaxone. carumonam showed an antibacterial potency equal to or higher than any other reference compound; in particular it was the most effective against proteus indole positive and klebsiella sp. its antipseudomonal activity was comparable to that of ceftazidime and it showed, together with aztreonam, the highest activity against the citrobacter, enterobacter and escherichia coli isolates. the minimal inhibitory concentrations performed on permeability altered organisms indicated that carumonam has a penetration rate comparable to aztreonam and higher than cefotetan and ceftriaxone. carumonam demonstrated excellent stability to chromosomal and plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and that correlated with its antibacterial activity against the producing strains and inoculum size effect.

AB  == cloacal swabs from 506 clinically normal psittacine birds of 22 species were aerobically cultured for bacteria and yeasts. in 45 (9%) samples, no microbial organisms were recovered. gram-positive bacteria were recovered from 474 (91%) samples. the incidences of gram-negative bacteria and yeasts were: escherichia coli 157 (31%), enterobacter sp. 21 (4%), klebsiella sp. 3 (0.6%), pseudomonas sp. 4 (0.8%), and yeasts 26 (5%). differences were noted in the recovery rate of  e. coli among the various species of birds cultured. escherichia coli was recovered from 101 of 168 cockatoos (60%) of the genus cacatua but from only 18%  of 338 non-cacatua species. as all birds were housed in the same facility under similar conditions, this difference in the incidence rate of e. coli cannot be explained on the basis of differences in husbandry or diet alone.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

AB  == nonhematogenous osteomyelitis (nho) occurred in 24 pediatric patients (ages 8 months to 18 years; median, 14 years; 23 male) admitted from 1980 to 1985. predisposing factors included compound fracture (12), deep decubiti (4) and foot  puncture (3). infection involved tibia (7), foot bones (6), proximal femur (3) and ulna (2). patients presented with drainage (64%), pain or tenderness (44%) and fever (32%) lasting for 1 to 180 days (median, 10 days). in 24% both white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal. initial radiographs were nondiagnostic in 42% after compound fractures. bone cultures were positive in 15 of 18 (83%) patients for: staphylococcus aureus (9), staphylococcus epidermidis (2), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), escherichia coli (2), enterobacter sp. (2), streptococcus faecalis, serratia sp., klebsiella pneumoniae, achromobacter xylosoxidans, aeromonas hydrophila and pseudomonas fluorescens (1 each). wound cultures failed to predict bone culture results in 12 of 16 patients (75%). nho recurred in 8 of 19 patients (42%) despite intravenously administered antibiotics for greater than 28 days and debridement in 7 of 8 patients. the indolent nature of nho complicates diagnosis, especially  in patients with recent compound fractures. only prompt bone culture can confirm  the presence of nho and reliably guide antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == a morphological study of the action of equine anti-lipopolysaccharide plasma on gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == three strains of gram-negative bacteria--one each of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter sp.--were treated with anti-lipopolysaccharide hyperimmune equine plasma (anti-lps) or non-immune control plasma and examined by scanning electronmicroscopy. within a few minutes of treatment with anti-lps, bacteria were agglutinated. evidence of cell membrane destruction was observed shortly thereafter and total cell disintegration and disruption occurred within 1-2 h. in contrast, non-immune plasma had no effect on cell morphology. this confirms the findings in previous microbiological studies that specific antibodies in anti-lps bind to lipopolysaccharide (lps endotoxin), and thereby initiate the destruction of gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == microbiology of the female genital tract.
AB  == patients who contract genital tract infections are predominantly young, are otherwise healthy, and generally respond well to treatment for bacterial infections. these infections are most commonly polymicrobial in etiology, with several noteworthy exceptions. often there is an inciting event such as childbirth, surgical intervention, pregnancy termination or intrauterine contraceptive device insertion. with treatment, prognosis for cure is excellent;  however, sequelae such as recurrent infections, infertility, or ectopic pregnancy can be serious. bacteria encountered in the female genital tract can be divided into aerobic and anaerobic organisms. among the aerobic gram-positive organisms,  several varieties of streptococci such as group b streptococci and enterococci occur frequently. staphylococcus aureus is an infrequent but important pathogen.  among the aerobic gram-negative organisms, the most common is escherichia coli. klebsiella sp. and proteus sp. occur in about 5% of genital tract infections. species that are more resistant to antibiotics, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter sp., occur in approximately 1% or 2% of these cases and are more likely to appear in patients who have previously received antibiotic therapy or who have been hospitalized for some time. among the anaerobic organisms, the most common gram-positive isolates are peptostreptococci and peptococci. clostridia sp. occurs less frequently. among the anaerobic gram-negative organisms, the bacteroides sp. most frequently encountered are bacteroides bivius and bacteroides disiens. bacteroides fragilis is still a common problem but appears to be less predominant. other organisms encountered are chlamydia trachomatis, the genital mycoplasmas, yeasts, protozoa, and viruses.

AB  == during six months the pattern of microbial isolates has been analysed from 1492 urinary tract infections, from 1445 wound infections, from 451 bronchial secretions, from 3067 blood cultures, from 116 peritoneal swabs and from 39 cerebrospinal fluids. all the specimens investigated were taken from patients of  surgical, neurosurgical, internal wards and two intensive care units. in total, the most frequent isolates were grampositive microorganisms like staphylococus aureus, straphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus sp. of different serotypes. out of the enterobacteriaceae escherichia coli and klebisella pneumoniae predominated followed by enterobacter cloacae and indolnegative and -positive proteus species. the over all isolation rate of pseudomonas aeruginosa in nosocomial infections was about 10%. in the last time pseudomonas maltophilia will be isolated more frequently as well as occasional streptococcus faecium and  corynebacterium jk. dependent from the site of infection anaerobic bacteria like  bacteroides sp., peptococcus- and peptostreptococcus sp. are really important in  the infectious diseases. the epidemiological data should be always transmitted to the infection control board. from there preventive measures must be induced.

TI  == microbiologic features and treatment of persistent peritonitis in patients in the intensive care unit.
AB  == the charts of 25 patients who died in the intensive care unit of persistent peritonitis after abdominal operations were reviewed to determine the microbial flora and the efficacy of antibiotic treatment. all patients had undergone two or more surgical procedures for abdominal sepsis and 23 had at least three-system organ failure. the most common organisms cultured were: staphylococcus epidermidis, 24 cultures from 16 patients, candida albicans, 19 cultures from 10  patients, pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 cultures from 12 patients, enterobacter, 16  cultures from 8 patients and enterococcus, 14 cultures from 8 patients. the classic isolates, escherichia coli (11 cultures from six patients) and bacteroides fragilis (4 cultures from three patients) were found infrequently. to determine the adequacy of antimicrobial therapy for this "new" flora, we examined the ability of appropriate agents to eradicate the micro-organism upon subsequent culture. candida sp. were eradicated in 54% (6 of 11) of the assessable cases, while enterococcus and s. epidermidis were cleared in only 25% and 28% respectively. the spectrum of intra-abdominal organisms cultured from critically  ill surgical patients in the intensive care unit differs from that seen in those  with acute peritonitis. despite administration of appropriate antimicrobial agents, these organisms tend to persist, probably reflecting impaired host defences with multiple-system organ failure rather than antimicrobial failure.

TI  == susceptibility testing with disc diffusion for new cephalosporins: pre-diffusion  revisited.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of 20-hour pre-diffusion, i.e. placing the antibiotic-containing discs on the agar for 20 hours prior to inoculation, as compared to direct diffusion, i.e. placing the discs on the agar immediately after inoculation, for the newer 3. generation cephalosporins as represented by ceftazidime and ceftriaxone. regression lines (zone sizes vs. inhibitory concentrations, as measured by plate-dilution) were constructed for three groups of bacteria chosen because of their differences in growth characteristics on agar: e. coli (n = 50), enterobacter sp. (n = 35), and  streptococci (n = 51). the results for both cephalosporins were: 20-hour pre-diffusion produced larger zones than direct diffusion, regression studies for 20-hour pre-diffusion as compared to direct diffusion resulted in greater variation in zone sizes, numerically lower slopes, lower residual variances and higher correlation coefficients, and regression lines were significantly different for the 3 groups of bacteria with direct diffusion but not so with 20-hour pre-diffusion. considering the interpretation of zone sizes with disc diffusion for the cephalosporins tested, 20-hour pre-diffusion was superior to direct diffusion.

TI  == in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin compared with other agents against recent hospital isolates.
AB  == ciprofloxacin's in vitro activity was tested against 385 hospital isolates originating from three geographically distinct regions. of all strains tested, only three (1 acinetobacter sp. and 2 pseudomonas aeruginosa) were ciprofloxacin  resistant. ciprofloxacin was more active against escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, acinetobacter sp., proteus sp., shigella sp. than gentamicin, mezlocillin and cefotaxime. it was more active than azlocillin and cefsulodin against p. aeruginosa. it was more active than cloxacillin and cefamandole against staphylococci. it was as active as cefotaxime against klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens. ciprofloxacin demonstrated similar activity in broth and solid agar. the minimal  inhibitory concentrations (mic's) of all strains were similar to the minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc's). ciprofloxacin's mic was not influenced by increase of the inoculum or addition of human serum and only slightly influenced  by anaerobic conditions. decrease of the medium ph increased the mic substantially. ciprofloxacin exhibited a rapid bactericidal effect and had only a minimal post-antibiotic effect. these favorable in vitro characteristics of ciprofloxacin warrant further studies.

AB  == twenty-five strains of enterobacteria, isolated from man in peninsular malaysia and consisting of seven enterobacter spp., five escherichia coli, five salmonella spp., four klebsiella spp., two shigella spp., one proteus sp. and and one providencia sp., were tested for antibiotic resistance and conjugative r plasmids. they were all sensitive to nalidixic acid and resistant to at least three antibiotics. the number of resistances ranged from 3 to 11 antibiotics, including cefoperazone and sisomicin (two) newly released antibiotics), in addition to common drugs of current use. of the 25 isolates, 19 (76%) conjugally  transferred, at varied frequencies, at least two resistance determinants. results from equilibrium density gradient centrifugation, agarose gel electrophoresis and transformation experiments provided proof that the transferable resistances were  plasmid-mediated. restriction endonuclease cleavage patterns showed that the plasmids from proteus strain k005 and providencia strain k001 may be identical.

TI  == [aerobic bacterial flora of the nasal cavity of rabbits].
AB  == on the basis of bacteriological examinations carried out in april 1984 on 60 intranasal swabs, aerobic respiratory microbes were studied in rabbits. differences in flora between animals with and without respiratory diseases were studied. fourteen bacterial species were identified with no difference due to the pathological status. they were: bordetella bronchiseptica, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus sp., branhamella catarrhalis, micrococcus sp., enterobacter agglomerans, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas paucimobilis, pseudomonas diminuta, alcaligenes faecalis and escherichia coli. however, young weaned rabbits were more often pasteurella carriers than adult females in maternity. the usefulness of performing only pasteurella and bordetella cultures in rabbits is questionable as is use of vaccines in order to prevent bacterial respiratory syndrome. it is emphasised that myxomatosis should be pursued in the investigation of respiratory infections in rabbit.

TI  == in-vitro activity of ofloxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid compared to other quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == ofloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound. its activity against 900 bacterial isolates was determined. it inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., aeromonas hydrophila, salmonella spp., shigella spp., citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, yersinia enterocolitica at less than or equal to 0.8 mg/l. branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus sp., neisseria sp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l.  pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pseudomonas species were inhibited by less than  or equal to 6.3 mg/l. although most staphylococcal species, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci were inhibited by 3.1 mg/l, many streptococcal species had higher mic values, and most bacteroides species were inhibited at less than or equal to 6.3 mg/l. the overall activity of ofloxacin was similar to enoxacin and norfloxacin. ofloxacin inhibited organisms resistant  to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, cephalexin, piperacillin, and gentamicin including enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime. the activity of ofloxacin was lower at an acid ph and in urine, but serum had no effect on mics or mbcs. increase in ofloxacin mics for various bacteria could be achieved by repeated subculture in the presence of ofloxacin.

TI  == cefadroxil in the horse: pharmacokinetics and in vitro antibacterial activity.
AB  == sodium cefadroxil was administered as a single intravenous dose (25 mg/kg) to six healthy adult mares. plasma samples were collected over a 24-h period and cefadroxil concentrations were measured by microbiological assay. the pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug was appropriately described in terms of a one-compartment open model. values for the major pharmacokinetic terms were: extrapolated initial plasma concentration = 59.2 +/- 15.0 micrograms/ml; half-life = 46 +/- 20 min; apparent volume of distribution = 462 +/- 191 ml/kg; and body clearance = 7.0 +/- 0.6 ml/min.kg. in a subsequent study, a suspension of cefadroxil monohydrate was administered intragastrically (25 mg/kg) to the same six horses. plasma concentrations of the drug peaked at 1-2 h but, in general, absorption was both poor and inconsistent. the data were unsuitable for  determination of cefadroxil bioavailability from this oral dosage form. ninety-nine isolates of eleven bacterial species obtained from clinically ill horses were tested for susceptibility to cefadroxil. all strains of streptococcus equi, streptococcus zooepidemicus, coagulase-positive staphylococci, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and five out of six strains of actinobacillus  suis were highly susceptible to the drug (mic less than 4 micrograms/ml). escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella sp. showed intermediate susceptibility (mic 4-16 micrograms/ml), while all isolates of corynebacterium (rhodococcus) equi, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa proved to be  highly resistant to cefadroxil (mic greater than 128 micrograms/ml).

AB  == a newly developed product, ks-r1 (a suppository containing 250 mg potency of ampicillin (abpc)), was given to 7 children (5 boys and 2 girls) ranging from 4 years and 5 months to 8 years and 10 months in age, 3 times a day (average daily  dose, 62.4 mg/kg) for 5 days. as a control, the same amount of abpc dry syrup was given orally to 7 children (4 boys and 3 girls) ranging from 2 years and 8 months to 7 years and 7 months in age, 3 times a day (average daily dose, 55.3 mg/kg) for 5 days. the effects of these 2 preparations on the bacterial flora of the feces were investigated, and concentrations of abpc in the feces and sensitivities of the isolated strains to abpc were determined. the results were as follows. as for gram-negative bacilli in the feces from children given ks-r1,  there was no change in escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., citrobacter sp. and enterobacter sp. which were isolated from many children 3 days after the end of treatment, but they did not show any constant pattern of change in mean number. other species did not show any pattern of increase in the number of children from whom they were isolated, or in the number of bacteria during the course after the beginning of treatment. the total number of bacteria identified as enterobacteriaceae was at the level of 10(8) cells/g on any day of examination. of gram-negative bacilli other than enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas sp. showed no constant pattern of change in number. on the other hand, of gram-positive bacteria, there was no constant pattern of change in the number of staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci began to be isolated from many children  5 days after the beginning of treatment and were isolated from all children 5 days after the end of treatment, but there was no tendency for the mean number to increase. enterococcus sp. was not isolated from 3 children 3 days after the beginning of treatment, and was decreased in number by one order in 3 out of other 4 children as compared with before-treatment. however, this species was isolated from all children 3 days after the end of treatment, and the mean number of bacteria was similar to that before-treatment although the number of bacteria  was different in individual children.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == a total of 222 cases of septicaemia was recorded at the university hospital of the west indies between june 1982 and june 1983. this gave an overall incidence of 16.1 per 1000 admissions. the 233 bacterial strains isolated comprised 100 gram-positive and 133 gram-negative organisms with klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus being the most frequent. highest rates of septicaemia were recorded in patients less than 1 year and over  50 years of age. septicaemia caused by gram-positive organisms was predominantly  a disease of children whereas that caused by gram-negative organisms arose more often in neonates and in patients over 50 years of age. a predisposing factor was noted in 104 patients of whom 42 had neoplastic disease. the most frequently identified initial sites of infection were the respiratory tract, the gastro-intestinal tract and the meninges. most blood stream infections were community-acquired, three quarters of all septicaemic patients being admitted to  the departments of medicine or paediatrics. there were 11 cases of polymicrobial  septicaemia caused predominantly by gram-negative organisms in patients with underlying disease. appropriate antimicrobial drugs were administered to 57% of septicaemic patients whereas 17% received superfluous antimicrobial therapy. in those patients who received inappropriate antimicrobial therapy there was a marked increase in mortality. forty of 61 deaths were attributed to septicaemia.  mortality from septicaemia caused by gram-negative organisms was 21% compared with 13% for that caused by gram-positive organisms. the organisms associated with the highest case fatality rates were escherichia coli, 53%; enterobacter sp., 27%; and beta-haemolytic streptococci 24%. there were no deaths from septicaemia caused by haemophilus influenzae, salmonella sp. or serratia sp. the  highest mortality rates were associated with neoplastic disease, diabetes, polymicrobial septicaemia, urinary tract infections and old age.

TI  == bacterial interference with coliform colony sheen production on membrane filters.
AB  == the membrane filter (mf) method for detection and enumeration of coliform bacteria in drinking water requires that the coliforms both grow and produce a green metallic sheen when the filter is incubated on modified endo medium at 35 degrees c for 22 h. large numbers of noncoliform bacteria, which are enumerated by the standard plate count (spc) technique, can interfere with the detection of  coliforms on mf. this paper presents quantitative evidence from laboratory experiments on the interference of specific spc bacteria on coliform colony sheen production on mf. pseudomonas aeruginosa and aeromonas hydrophila caused significant reductions in escherichia coli sheen colony counts when present at 3,000 and 220 per filter, respectively. the flavobacterium sp. and bacillus sp. selected for this study from spc did not interfere with coliform colony sheen production. excessive crowding of e. coli and enterobacter cloacae colonies on mf also caused a reduction in the number of colonies that produced sheen. even when  there was no crowding (14 colonies per filter), only a fraction of the e. cloacae colonies produced sheen colonies on modified endo medium.

AB  == the activity of amifloxacin, a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound, against 147 strains of microorganisms was studied and was compared with the activities of cinoxacin, trimethoprim, amikacin, and four beta-lactam antimicrobials. the minimal concentration at which 90% of strains were inhibited by amifloxacin was lowest for escherichia coli and klebsiella sp (less than or equal to 0.125 microgram/ml), followed by proteus sp (less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml),  enterobacter sp and citrobacter sp (less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml), providencia sp (less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml), and pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia sp, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus var anitratus (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml). when compared with the ranges of activity of seven  reference antimicrobials, the range of amifloxacin activity was lowest for p aeruginosa, citrobacter sp, proteus sp, and a calcoaceticus var anitratus and similar to aztreonam's activity against enterobacter sp. for amikacin-resistant p aeruginosa, the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of amifloxacin ranged from 1 to 16 micrograms/ml. the mics and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of amifloxacin were similar. for all strains tested, microbial susceptibilities to amifloxacin were greater than those to currently available oral antimicrobial drugs, such as cinoxacin and trimethoprim.

TI  == multicenter clinical trials of cefoperazone in japan.
AB  == the safety and clinical efficacy of cefoperazone were evaluated at 149 institutions in japan. a total of 979 hospitalized patients were treated with cefoperazone alone for 1,059 infections. in the 984 infections evaluated, there was an overall satisfactory clinical response in 824 (83.7%). cefoperazone was effective in 83.0% of the respiratory tract infections, 84.9% of urinary tract infections, and 89.6% of hepatobiliary tract infections. clinical response was satisfactory in 90% or more of the cases in which escherichia coli, serratia sp,  haemophilus influenzae or staphylococcus sp were isolated. sixty percent to 90% of the infections with klebsiella sp, enterobacter sp, proteus sp, and pseudomonas aeruginosa responded satisfactorily to cefoperazone. cefoperazone was effective in 76.2% of 260 evaluated cases that had failed to respond to prior treatment with other cephalosporins. the adverse reactions that occurred in 19 (1.9%) of the 979 patients included rash (1%), diarrhea (0.6%), and fever (0.4%). cefoperazone appears to be extremely useful in the treatment of various infections in hospitalized patients.

TI  == efficacy of ceftizoxime administered twice daily in hospitalized patients with respiratory tract infections.
AB  == the efficacy and safety of ceftizoxime administered twice daily were evaluated in 215 hospitalized patients with documented lower respiratory tract infections. the majority of patients received 1 to 2 gm of ceftizoxime intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours; the mean dosage was 2 gm/day, and the mean duration of therapy was 8.9 days. clinical cure was achieved in 204 (95%) of the 215 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. one hundred and thirty-eight patients were both clinically and bacteriologically evaluable. the clinical response rates, by organism, were: streptococcus pneumoniae, 100% (50/50); haemophilus influenzae, 96% (25/26); gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter sp, serratia sp, pseudomonas sp, klebsiella sp, citrobacter sp, and morganella morganii), 86% (32/37); and staphylococcus aureus, 92% (12/13). in the other 77 patients with clinical symptoms, no pathogen was isolated or insufficient follow-up data were collected to assess bacteriologic response. adverse reactions, which were infrequent, were similar to those reported in other us trials of the drug. the findings indicate that ceftizoxime,  1 to 2 gm bid, is effective and safe in the treatment of lower respiratory tract  infections in hospitalized patients. this low-dose regimen can significantly reduce the cost of cephalosporin therapy.

TI  == urinary tract infection and drug-resistant bacteria in different patient populations.
AB  == a 1-year survey of the pathogens causing urinary tract infections was conducted in three institutions: a rehabilitation hospital, a general hospital and outpatient clinics. gram-negative rods accounted for 96% of the infections. in the general hospital and the outpatient clinics, escherichia coli was the most prevalent pathogen, while proteus sp. were most prevalent in the rehabilitation hospital. the frequency of drug-resistant isolates was significantly higher in the rehabilitation hospital than in the general hospital and the outpatient clinics. this was most conspicuous in the use of the beta-lactam antibiotics, aminoglycosides and sulfonamides against such organisms as e. coli, klebsiella sp., enterobacter sp. and proteus sp. urinary e. coli were more sensitive to antimicrobial drugs than were other urinary pathogens. pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were highly resistant to most antibiotics. about half of the isolates were resistant to gentamicin and another half to carbenicillin. in some instances the frequency of drug-resistant isolates was higher in the general hospital than  in the outpatient clinics, reflecting the greater usage of antimicrobials in the  general hospital.

TI  == plasmids encoding trimethoprim resistance in bacterial isolates from man and pigs.
AB  == trimethoprim (tp) resistant gram negative bacteria were isolated from humans and  pigs. the bacterial hosts were characterized by their resistance pattern and biotype. the presence of transferable tp plasmids was demonstrated in 86% of 59 porcine isolates and 37% of 49 human isolates. the tp r-plasmids carried a diversity of resistance determinants such as tc, cm, sp, sm and su. incompatibility tests distinguished two major groups, inc fiv and inc n. thirty of 99 tp r-plasmids isolated from humans were grouped as inc fiv and eight as inc n. the results of molecular weight determination of tp r-plasmids performed by agarose gel electrophoresis were consistent with the existence of two groups--larger r-plasmids (76 to 104 md) belonging to inc fiv and lower molecular weight r-plasmids (25 to 35 md) belonging to inc n. results from this study indicate that the tp r-plasmids isolated in perth have evolved independently from those described in europe and the united kingdom. there is also evidence for their local spread between escherichia, klebsiella, enterobacter, citrobacter and acinetobacter from man and animals.

TI  == 6-acetylmethylenepenicillanic acid (ro 15-1903), a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. ii. antibacterial properties.
AB  == the beta-lactamase inhibitor ro 15-1903 showed low affinity for penicillin binding proteins (pbps) of escherichia coli. when used as a single compound, it displayed no substantial antibacterial activity but in combination with ampicillin, it was similar to clavulanic acid in conferring activity against ampicillin-resistant strains. some synergy between ro 15-1903 and piperacillin was found against high inocula of pseudomonas aeruginosa. ro 15-1903 markedly enhanced the activity of ceftriaxone against bacteroides fragilis. in keeping with the in vitro findings, the combination ro 15-1903 and ampicillin protected mice against systemic infections with beta-lactamase-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus sp. but not against those with enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and e. coli producing either chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of type i or plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase of type tem.

AB  == a quantitative culture technique (hand washed in a glove containing broth for 30  s) was used to determine the frequency of hand carriage of aerobic gram-negative  rods by various groups of health care workers and 104 control subjects. overall,  31% of health care workers carried aerobic gram-negative rods on their hands compared to 59% of control subjects (p < 0.001). enterobacter agglomerans accounted for 40% of the isolates, and other enterobacter spp. 7%. other organisms included acinetobacter calcoaceticus 21%, serratia spp. 11%, klebsiella spp. 10%, moraxella spp. 3%, pseudomonas spp. 3%, proteus spp. 1.5%, escherichia  coli 1%; morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, aeromonas sp. and an isolate  that was not speciated accounted for 0.5% each. we conclude that endemic hand carriage of aerobic gram-negative rods by health care personnel is common, but significantly less than that of control subjects. enterobacter agglomerans is found so frequently on the hands of control subjects that it must be considered part of the normal hand flora.

TI  == poly(adenylic acid) in small amounts, free or covalently linked to substrate, protects rna from hydrolysis by ribonuclease.
AB  == short lengths (18 residues) of poly(a), covalently linked to the 3'-termini of escherichia coli 5 s rrna, induce powerful inhibitions (38-87%) of the activities of rnaases (ribonucleases) from citrobacter sp., enterobacter sp., bovine pancreas, human spleen and human plasma. as the polypurine chain length is extended, enzyme activity declines. furthermore, poly(a) sequences, present only  on a small subpopulation of rna, and accounting for less than 1% of total rna, serve to protect all rna, polyadenylated or not, from enzyme-catalysed degradation. the quantity of 3'-terminal adenylic acid residues, relative to the  amount of substrate, determines enzyme activity. the exact distribution of a fixed amount of poly(a) residues on the 3'-termini of substrate molecules is unimportant in this respect. comparison of the efficacies of inhibition of rnaase activity, by using linked poly(a) and similar quantities of free poly(a), revealed that although the free polypurine inhibits rnaase activity, covalent linkage of poly(a) to rna is more advantageous to the stability of an rna substrate. however, the ratio of inhibited activities obtained by using linked or free poly(a) may change considerably with alterations in either substrate concentration or polyadenylic acid segment length.

TI  == comparison of direct and standard antimicrobial disk susceptibility testing for bacteria isolated from blood.
AB  == to determine the reliability of early antimicrobial susceptibility testing, we compared the results of direct and standard single-disk diffusion methods for 581 positive blood cultures processed routinely by the clinical microbiology laboratory. the direct procedure differed from the standard one only in that the  0.5 mcfarland inoculum was prepared from 1 ml of turbid broth rather than five isolated colonies from a subculture plate. a major discrepancy in results was defined as a change from susceptible to resistant or vice versa according to interpretive standards for zone diameters, whereas a minor discrepancy was defined as a shift to or from the intermediate category when paired direct and standard tests were compared. the overall agreement between the two methods was 94.6% of 2,308 comparisons. there were 119 minor (5.2%) and 6 major (0.3%) discrepancies. the major discrepancies were seen with three strains of staphylococcus epidermidis and one strain each of s. aureus, escherichia coli, and enterobacter sp. direct susceptibility testing of positive blood cultures that were pure by gram-stained smear provided reliable results 24 to 36 h earlier than conventional procedures; therefore, we recommended this procedure to guide early antimicrobial therapy in patients with bacterial sepsis.

AB  == the mrna for a major outer membrane lipoprotein from escherichia coli was found to hybridize specifically with one of the ecori and one of the hindiii restriction endonuclease-generated fragments of total dna from nine bacteria in the family enterobacteriaceae: e. coli, shigella dysenteriae, salmonella typhimurium, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella aerogenes, enterobacter aerogenes,  edwardsiella tarda, serratia marcescens, and erwinia amylovora. however, among the enterobacteriaceae, dna from two species of proteus (p. mirabilis and p. morganii) did not contain any restriction endonuclease fragments that hybridized  with the e. coli lipoprotein mrna. furthermore, no hybrid bands were detected in  four other gram-negative bacteria outside the family enterobacteriaceae: pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter sp. ho1-n, caulobacter crescentus, and myxococcus xanthus. envelope fractions from all bacteria in the family enterobacteriaceae tested above cross-reacted with antiserum against the purified e. coli free-form lipoprotein in the ouchterlony immunodiffusion test. both species of proteus, however, gave considerably weaker precipitation lines, in comparison with the intense lines produced by the other members of the family. all of the above four bacteria outside the family enterobacteriaceae did not cross-react with anti-e. coli lipoprotein serum. from these results, the rate of  evolutionary changes in the lipoprotein gene seems to be closely related to that  observed for various soluble enzymes of the enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == quantitative assessment of bactericidal activities of beta-lactam antibiotics by  agar plate method.
AB  == quantitative bactericidal activities of beta-lactam antibiotics were determined by the agar plate method. broth cultures, of which the colony-forming units were  counted before the study, were inoculated on antibiotic-containing agar plates, utilizing a 10(-3), 10(-2), or 10(-1) dilution or undiluted culture plated with each 0.001-ml calibrated loop. these plates were incubated at 37 degrees c overnight, and the minimal drug concentration at which no bacterial growth was observed on the plates was defined as minimal inhibitory concentration. after this procedure, the agar surface was treated with beta-lactamase spray to inactivate the antibiotic. these plates were incubated again at 37 degrees c overnight. the minimal drug concentration at which no evidence of bacterial growth was visible on the plates (resulting in a 100% kill) was defined as minimal bactericidal concentration. the lowest concentration which reduced the number of colony-forming units to 1/1,000 that in the original inoculum (resulting in a 99.9% kill) was defined as minimal lethal concentration. when compared for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., serratia  marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (non-enterococcal), beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and enterococcus, the minimal bactericidal concentrations were generally several fold higher than the minimal inhibitory concentrations. minimal lethal concentrations were virtually the same as minimal inhibitory concentrations for gram-negative strains; however, for some gram-positive strains, minimal lethal concentrations were higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations.

AB  == fifty-one clinical isolates of ticarcillin-resistant, gram-negative bacilli were  tested for susceptibility to combinations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid (brl 14151), a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were measured by a microdilution method, and minimal bactericidal concentrations for selected strains were measured by the broth dilution method. ticarcillin mics were >/=128 mug/ml for all and >/=512 mug/ml for 38 (75%) of the strains. thirty-nine strains of enterobacteriaceae tested included escherichia coli (14), klebsiella pneumoniae (16), citrobacter sp. (3), enterobacter sp. (3), salmonella enteritidis (1), serratia marcescens (1), and proteus mirabilis (1). ticarcillin mics for 34 strains (88%) were lowered at least threefold by the addition of 1.0 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. against 33 strains (85%), the mics were 64 mug or less per ml in the presence of 5 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. in contrast, the mics for seven of eight strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were unaffected by the addition of up to 10 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. ticarcillin with 5 mug of clavulanic acid per ml was bactericidal against ticarcillin-resistant (mic >/= 2,048 mug/ml) e. coli, k. pneumoniae, enterobacter, and p. mirabilis.

TI  == colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == a study of colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) was conducted in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice. groups of germfree akr mice were swabbed with five bacterial and a single gastrointestinal yeast species: streptococcus faecalis. lactobacillus brevis. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, bacteroides fragilis var. vulgatus, and torulopsis sp. all species became established in the gut in 8 weeks. later these associated mice were divided and challenged by four graded doses of e. coli or p. aeruginosa. the presence of challenge organism was monitored specifically in the freshly voided fecal specimens of the challenged mice. escherichia coli colonized the gut of each mouse at each level up to 60 days post challenge. pseudomonas aeruginosa was completely eliminated from each mouse at each dose level after 30 days post challenge. evidence suggests that all six species were sufficient to prevent the  colonization of p. aeruginosa and not of e. coli in the gut of the gnotobiotic mice.

TI  == studies on 4 c stored frozen-reconstituted red blood cells. i. bacterial growth.
AB  == a knowledge of the growth rates of various organisms at the storage temperature of 4 c in the different suspending media used for red blood cells would aid the extension of the thawed storage time of frozen-reconstituted blood beyond the 24  hours allowed by the food and drug administration. knowing these rates, a prediction could be made that the growth rate would be sufficiently slow and the  unit (sterile or minimally contaminated) could be given safely after a longer storage period. the studies reported show that the pathogenic organisms s. aureus, ps. aeruginosa, e. coli, klebsiella sp. and enterobacter sp. grow at such a slow rate at 4 c that they do not represent any great hazard to the recipient unless introduced in great numbers. the studies further show that in the process  of washing frozen blood the number of organisms is reduced by between one and two orders of magnitude (base 10). therefore, extension of frozen red blood cell storage life to at least 72 hours should be considered.

AB  == electrical impedance changes in the medium were studied during traditional broth  dilution tests. tests involved clinical isolates of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter sp., klebsiella, and  enterococcus and ten antibiotics. minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values from overnight visual readings were compared with mic values determined from electrical impedance end points, using inocula of 10(6) organisms per ml. ninety-three percent of the results were within one twofold dilution of each other. when the impedance end point was determined at 6 h, this correlation was lowered to 34%. by increasing the initial electrical impedance inoculum 10-fold,  the correlation between the 6-h impedance mic and the overnight visual mic was improved to 74%. ampicillin, tetracycline, and polymyxin e results accounted for  most discrepancies. continuous monitoring of impedance changes suggested that better correspondence could be obtained by adjusting the end point criteria for the 6-h impedance mic with different antibiotics. electrical impedance methods for reading bacterial end points in automated clinical laboratory instruments appear promising.

AB  == bl-s 339 is a new broad-spectrum, parenterally effective cephalosporin whose expression of antibacterial activity in vitro is markedly affected by the nature  of the assay medium. when assayed in nutrient agar, bl-s 339 was more active than cephalothin against strains of diplococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter, and indole-positive proteus sp. however, when assayed in mueller-hinton medium, its activity, especially against gram-negative bacteria, was reduced substantially, whereas the activity of cephalothin was virtually unaffected by the assay medium. the in vivo activity of bl-s 339 correlated well with its activity in nutrient agar; when administered subcutaneously to mice, it was therapeutically more efficacious than cephalothin in infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. when bl-s 339 was administered intramuscularly to mice, the concentrations achieved in the blood were three times those achieved with cephalothin. bl-s 339 was bound to human serum proteins to the same extent as cephalothin. recovery of bl-s 339 in the urine within the 24-hr period after intramuscular administration to rats was three times that of cephalothin.

TI  == in vitro studies of semisynthetic alpha-(substituted-ureido) penicillins.
AB  == the activity of three alpha-(substituted-ureido) penicillins was evaluated in vitro against 599 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli, by use of the broth-dilution technique. at a concentration of 12.5 mug or less/ml, bl-p1597 inhibited 90% of isolates of pseudomonas sp., 56% of enterobacter sp., 67% of indole-positive proteus spp., 72% of escherichia coli, and 85% of proteus mirabilis. bl-p1654 had similar activity, whereas bl-p1532 was much less active.  at a concentration of 25 mug or less/ml, bl-p1597 also inhibited nearly 60% of isolates of klebsiella sp. and nearly 40% of serratia sp. bl-p1597 and bl-p1654 were as active as ampicillin and carbenicillin against e. coli and p. mirabilis.  they were less active than carbenicillin against indole-positive proteus spp. both drugs were substantially more active than carbenicillin against pseudomonas  sp. a strain of pseudomonas sp. which developed resistance to carbenicillin also  developed resistance to the alpha-(substituted-ureido) penicillins simultaneously.

TI  == enhancing effect on alkalinization of the medium on the activity of erythromycin  against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of erythromycin was markedly enhanced by alkalinization of the culture medium or urine within the clinical range (ph 6.0 to 8.2). this effect was demonstrated against recent isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis. the urine of normal volunteers was made alkaline by ingestion of sodium bicarbonate or acetazolamide (diamox) during administration of 1.0 g of erythromycin every 8 hr; such urine was capable of inhibiting e. coli and k. pneumoniae even when diluted  up to (in one instance) 128 times with broth of the same ph as the urine. undiluted urine of the same subjects, without alkalinization, was seldom capable  of inhibiting these organisms. the range of ph (6.6 to 8.6) over which the antibacterial effect was enhanced coincided with that over which there was decreasing ionization of a basic group.

TI  == in vitro activity of carbenicillin against gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == the activity of a new semisynthetic penicillin, carbenicillin, was determined against 241 strains of gram-negative bacilli with the tube-dilution technique. of 143 strains of pseudomonas sp., 99 had a minimal inhibitory concentration of 200  to 300 mug/ml. the majority of strains of escherichia coli and proteus spp. were  sensitive to this antibiotic, with minimal inhibitory concentrations of 25 mug/ml or less. strains of klebsiella sp. were quite resistant to carbenicillin. the size of inoculum had no significant effect on the minimal inhibitory concentration for pseudomonas sp.

TI  == effect of coliform and proteus bacteria on growth of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == cultures of coliform and proteus bacteria, mostly from foods, were tested for their effect on growth of staphylococcus aureus in trypticase soy broth. inhibition of the staphylococcus by these competitors increased with increasing proportions of inhibiting (effector) bacteria in the inoculum and decreasing incubation temperatures (37 to 10 c). time required for 2 x 10(4) staphylococci to increase to 5 x 10(6) cells per milliliter, the minimal number assumed to be necessary for food poisoning, varied with the species of effector, the original ratio of effector bacteria to staphylococci in the medium, and the incubation temperature. when the original ratio was 100:1, the staphylococci did not reach 5 x 10(6) cells per milliliter at 10, 15, 22, or 30 c (with one exception), when growing with cultures representing six species of coliform bacteria and two of proteus. when the ratio was 1:1, all effectors either greatly delayed the staphylococcus or prevented it from reaching hazardous numbers at 15 c, six of the eight caused a delay of 2 to 3 hr at 22 c, and only escherichia coli delayed  the coccus at 30 c. all effectors were ineffective at 22 and 30 c when original numbers of effectors and staphylococci were in the ratio 1:100. greatest overall  inhibition was by e. coli, e. freundii, and proteus vulgaris, and these species were more effective than the others at 22 and 30 c. aerobacter cloacae and paracolobactrum aerogenoides were more effective at 15 c. in general, results were similar with different strains of a species. except for aerobacter aerogenes, klebsiella sp., and p. aerogenoides, which apparently did not compete  for nutrients, inhibition of the staphylococcus was by a combination of antibiotic substances and competition for nutrients.

TI  == repression of staphylococcus aureus by food bacteria. ii. causes of inhibition.
AB  == two food bacteria, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas sp. cs-1, inhibited an enterotoxigenic strain of staphylococcus aureus, apparently by out-competing it for nutrients. five others, bacillus cereus, proteus vulgaris, escherichia coli h-52, aerobacter aerogenes, and achromobacter sp., inhibited by means of antibiotic substances which were seitz-filterable, dialyzable, and stable at 90 c for 10 min. inhibition was not caused by changes in ph, oxidation-reduction potential, or production of peroxide or fatty acids. the concentrated antibiotic  material from e. coli h-52 contained amino acids but not peptides and was especially effective against staphylococci and micrococci.
