TI  - In vitro antagonistic activities of animal intestinal strains against swine-associated pathogens.
AB  - A wide range of enteropathogens cause costly diarrhoeal diseases in fattening piglets and account for food-related infections in humans. The objective of this study was to screen beneficial bacterial strains from the gastrointestinal tract of various animal sources for antagonistic activity against diverse pathogens associated with hazardous pig production times. Using agar spot assays, 15 well-characterized strains belonging to Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Bifidobacterium and Bacillus were studied for inhibition of Clostridium perfringens type A, various serovars of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, as well as Brachyspira pilosicoli. Strong antagonists were further analyzed by studying their cell-free supernatants with and without pH neutralization, proteinase K and catalase treatment. Enterobacteriaceae were effectively inhibited by Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus reuteri strains, independent from the animal source, and on a lower level by single strains belonging to Lactobacillus mucosae, Lactobacillus amylovorus and Bifidobacterium thermophilum, due to organic acid production. The Bacillus subtilis strain was found to produce an anti-clostridial and anti-Brachyspira metabolite of proteinaceous nature. Homofermentative lactobacilli and B. thermophilum could suppress the growth of B. pilosicoli, the causative agent of intestinal spirochaetosis, whereas heterofermentative strains belonging to L. reuteri and L. mucosae had no effect. The lactic acid bacteria exerted their activity primarily by organic acid release, except one Enterococcus faecium and L. amylovorus strain, which exhibited antagonism through joint activity of lactate and hydrogen peroxide. The findings of this study provide a basis for further in vitro studies and encourage feeding studies to evaluate the antagonistic potential of promising strains in pig production.
TI  - Prevalence of selected enteropathogenic bacteria in Hungarian finishing pigs.
AB  - The aim of this study was to obtain prevalence estimates about the most important enteropathogenic bacteria: Lawsonia intracellularis, Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, Brachyspira pilosicoli, Salmonella enterica and Clostridium perfringens A and C in Hungarian farrow-to-finish pig herds. A total of 31 herds were selected, from where six pooled faecal samples, each containing three individual rectal faecal samples were collected from fattening pigs of 5-6 months of age. All 186 samples were examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of the pathogens mentioned above. Lawsonia intracellularis was found in 29 herds (93.55%) and in 108 samples (58.06%); B. hyodysenteriae in 14 herds (45.16%) and in 23 samples (12.37%); B. pilosicoli in 19 herds (61.29%) and in 53 samples (28.49%); S. enterica in 17 herds (54.83%) and in 40 samples (21.50%). We detected the presence of C. perfringens A in 19 herds (61.29%) and in 46 samples (24.73%), while C. perfringens C was found in 8 herds (25.81%) and in 11 samples (5.91%). All examined herds were infected with one or more of these agents. Herds with diarrhoea in the mid- to late finishing phase had almost 10 times higher prevalence of B. hyodysenteriae than herds without such a history.
TI  - Brachyspira (Serpulina) pilosicoli of human origin interfere with the growth of Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin producer.
AB  - Brachyspira (Serpulina) pilosicoli of human origin interfere with the growth of Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin producer reducing the clostridial growth area and colonies number when bacteria were cultivated together in sheep blood agar plates. The growth inhibition of C. perfringens was only observed when B. (S.) pilosicoli grew 72-96 hours sooner than C. perfringens and after the inoculum of this latter the plates were anaerobically incubated for additional 48 hours. The phenomenon was observed at concentrations of B. (S.) pilosicoli ranging from 10(7) to 10(4) CFU/ml and at concentrations of C. perfringens ranging from 10(7) to 10(1) CFU/ml when the bacteria were 0-10 mm away from each other. When B. (S.) pilosicoli and C. perfringens were inoculated at the same time and when B. (S.) pilosicoli grew 24-48 hours sooner than C. perfringens, the clostridial growth inhibition was not appreciated and only a cooperative haemolysis was observed between the bacteria.
TI  - Weakly beta-haemolytic human intestinal spirochaetes antagonize the haemolytic activity of Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin producer.
AB  - The production of haemolytic antagonism between weakly beta-haemolytic human intestinal spirochaetes (wbetaHIS) related to human intestinal spirochaetosis and Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin producer was investigated. A reduction of the clostridial haemolytic activity and a distortion of the haemolytic halo of clostridial alpha-toxin surrounded by a small zone of poorly cooperative haemolysis was clearly observed on the level of the spirochaetal growth area when 40 out of 41 wbetaHIS were cultivated in sheep blood agar plates together with Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin producer. This phenomenon of haemolytic antagonism was observed only when wbetaHIS grew 72-96 hours sooner than C. perfringens and after the inoculum of the latter at a distance of 0 to 10 mm from wbetaHIS the plates were anaerobically incubated for an additional 48 hours and the bacteria were used at concentrations ranging from 10(7) to 10(4) CFU/ml. These results were also observed between C. perfringens and weakly beta-haemolytic intestinal spirochaetes related to animal intestinal spirochaetosis including avian strains and Brachyspira (Serpulina) pilosicoli of porcine origin.
TI  - Comparative pathology of bacterial enteric diseases of swine.
AB  - Enteric bacterial infections are among the most common and economically significant diseases affecting swine production worldwide. Clinical signs of these infections include diarrhea, reduced growth rate, weight loss, and death of preweaned, weanling, grower-finisher, young and adult age breeding animals. The most common etiological agents include Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Lawsonia intracellularis, Salmonella enterica, and Brachyspira (Serpulina) spp. With the exception of Brachyspira (Serpulina) hyodysenteriae, the cause of swine dysentery, and Lawsonia intracellularis, the cause of proliferative enteropathy, the pathological changes seen with these agents closely resemble the diseases occurring in human beings. Histological changes in the intestines of swine with enteric bacterial infections include bacterial colonization without significant damage (e.g., certain enterotoxigenic E. coli and C. perfringens type A), attaching and effacing lesions with enteropathogenic E. coli and Brachyspira pilosicoli, the cause of colonic spirochetosis, inflammation with S. enterica, and necrotizing and hemorrhagic lesions with certain C. perfringens. Extraintestinal spread of bacteria and/or toxins occurs with some serotypes of E. coli and most serotypes of S. enterica. Enteric bacterial diseases of swine have been used as models to study the pathogenesis of similar diseases of human beings. Several of these pathogens are also important causes of food-borne disease in humans.
