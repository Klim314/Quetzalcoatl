TI  - Construction of allitol synthesis pathway by multi-enzyme coexpression in Escherichia coli and its application in allitol production.
AB  - An engineered strain for the conversion of D-fructose to allitol was developed by constructing a multi-enzyme coupling pathway and cofactor recycling system in Escherichia coli. D-Psicose-3-epimerase from Ruminococcus sp. and ribitol dehydrogenase from Klebsiella oxytoca were coexpressed to form the multi-enzyme coupling pathway for allitol production. The cofactor recycling system was constructed using the formate dehydrogenase gene from Candida methylica for continuous NADH supply. The recombinant strain produced 10.62 g/l allitol from 100 mM D-fructose. To increase the intracellular concentration of the substrate, the glucose/fructose facilitator gene from Zymomonas mobilis was incorporated into the engineered strain. The results showed that the allitol yield was enhanced significantly to 16.53 g/l with a conversion rate of 92 %. Through optimizing conversion conditions, allitol was produced effectively on a large scale by the whole-cell biotransformation system; the yield reached 48.62 g/l when 500 mM D-fructose was used as the substrate.
TI  - Co-expression of D-glucose isomerase and D-psicose 3-epimerase: development of an efficient one-step production of D-psicose.
AB  - D-Psicose has been attracting attention in recent years because of its alimentary activities and is used as an ingredient in a range of foods and dietary supplements. To develop a one-step enzymatic process of D-psicose production, thermoactive D-glucose isomerase and the D-psicose 3-epimerase obtained from Bacillus sp. and Ruminococcus sp., respectively, were successfully co-expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 strain. The substrate of one-step enzymatic process was D-glucose. The co-expression system exhibited maximum activity at 65 degrees C and pH 7.0. Mg(2+) could enhance the output of D-psicose by 2.32 fold to 1.6 g/L from 10 g/L of D-glucose. When using high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) as substrate, 135 g/L D-psicose was produced under optimum conditions. The mass ratio of D-glucose, D-fructose, and D-psicose was almost 3.0:2.7:1.0, when the reaction reached equilibrium after an 8h incubation time. This co-expression system approaching to produce D-psicose has potential application in food and beverage products, especially softdrinks.
TI  - The inhibitory effect of polyphenols on human gut microbiota.
AB  - The intestinal microbiota (IM) is responsible for metabolism of many compounds provided in the diet, such as polyphenols, increasing their bioavailability. However, there are remarkably few studies investigating the influence of polyphenols on the composition and activity of the gut microbial community. This study evaluated the influence of the polyphenols naringenin (N), naringin (NR), hesperetin (H), hesperidin (HR), quercetin (Q), rutin (QR), and catechin (CAT) on the growth of human IM representatives (Bacteroides galacturonicus, Lactobacillus sp., Enterococcus caccae, Bifidobacterium catenulatum, Ruminococcus gauvreauii, Escherichia coli). Polyphenols were added to liquid medium at a final concentration of 20, 100 or 250 mug/ml (for Q concentrations were 4, 20 or 50 mug/ml) and their impact on the IM was assessed by measurement of the turbidity after 24-h culture. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for polyphenols that inhibited bacteria was estimated. CAT had no impact on the tested IM. Q had the strongest impact on R. gauvreauii, B. galacturonicus and Lactobacillus sp. (MIC 20-50 mug/ml) growth, whilst its rutinoside had no impact. NR and HR had no impact, but their aglycones N and H inhibited growth of almost all analyzed bacteria (MIC >/=250 mug/ml). We conclude that flavonoid aglycones, but not their glycosides, may inhibit growth of some intestinal bacteria. This means that polyphenols probably can modulate the IM and indirectly interfere with their own bioavailability.
TI  - Overexpression of D-psicose 3-epimerase from Ruminococcus sp. in Escherichia coli and its potential application in D-psicose production.
AB  - The D-psicose 3-epimerase (DPE) gene from Ruminococcus sp. was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein was purified and characterized. It was optimally active at pH 7.5-8.0 and 60 degrees C. Activity was not dependent on the presence of metal ions; however, it became more thermostable with added Mn(2+). The K (m) of the enzyme for D-psicose (48 mM) was lower than that for D-tagatose (230 mM), suggesting that D-psicose is the optimum substrate. More importantly, the thermostability of the novel DPE from Ruminococcus is the strongest among all of the D-psicose and D-tagatose 3-epimerases and may be suitable for the industrial production of D-psicose from fructose.
TI  - Microbial community analysis and identification of alternative host-specific fecal indicators in fecal and river water samples using pyrosequencing.
AB  - It is important to know the comprehensive microbial communities of fecal pollution sources and receiving water bodies for microbial source tracking. Pyrosequencing targeting the V1-V3 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene was used to investigate the characteristics of bacterial and Bacteroidales communities in major fecal sources and river waters. Diversity analysis indicated that cow feces had the highest diversities in the bacterial and Bacteroidales group followed by the pig sample, with human feces having the lowest value. The Bacteroidales, one of the potential fecal indicators, totally dominated in the fecal samples accounting for 31%-52% of bacterial sequences, but much less (0.6%) in the river water. Clustering and Venn diagram analyses showed that the human sample had a greater similarity to the pig sample in the bacterial and Bacteroidales communities than to samples from other hosts. Traditional fecal indicators, i.e., Escherichia coli, were detected in the human and river water samples at very low rates and Clostridium perfringens and enterococci were not detected in any samples. Besides the Bacteroidales group, some microorganisms detected in the specific hosts, i.e., Parasutterella excrementihominis, Veillonella sp., Dialister invisus, Megamonas funiformis, and Ruminococcus lactaris for the human and Lactobacillus amylovorus and Atopostipes sp. for the pig, could be used as potential host-specific fecal indicators. These microorganisms could be used as multiple fecal indicators that are not dependent on the absence or presence of a single indicator. Monitoring for multiple indicators that are highly abundant and host-specific would greatly enhance the effectiveness of fecal pollution source tracking.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a ferulic acid esterase (Fae1A) from the rumen  fungus Anaeromyces mucronatus.
AB  - AIMS: A novel ferulic acid esterase gene from rumen fungus Anaeromyces mucronatus was cloned, heteroexpressed in Escherichia coli and characterized. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 30 clones exhibiting activity on alpha-naphthyl acetate (alpha-NA) were isolated from an A. mucronatus YE505 cDNA library. Sequence analysis revealed that these clones represented two esterase-coding sequences. The gene, fae1A, showed highest amino acid sequence identity to CE family 1 esterases from anaerobic micro-organisms such as Orpinomyces sp., Ruminococcus albus and Clostridium thermocellum. The gene comprised 828 nucleotides encoding a polypeptide of 275 amino acids. The coding sequence was cloned into the pET30a expression vector and overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Gene product Fae1A was found to exhibit activity against a number of substrates including naphthyl fatty acid esters, p-nitrophenyl fatty acid esters and hydroxylcinnamic acid esters. CONCLUSIONS: Fae1A exhibited a lower K(m) and higher catalytic efficiency (k(cat) /K(m) ) on ferulic acid esters than on alpha-NA or p-nitrophenyl acetate, suggesting that it has a higher affinity for ethyl and methyl ferulate than for the acetyl esters. It releases ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid from barley straw. Activity of Fae1A was inhibited by the serine-specific protease inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, indicating that a serine residue plays a role in its activity. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: To our knowledge, this is the first report of characterization of carbohydrate esterase gene from the genus of Anaeromyces.
TI  - Dysbiosis of fecal microbiota in Crohn's disease patients as revealed by a custom phylogenetic microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  RNA probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and Crohn's disease (CD) patients. METHODS: Oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "GoArray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16S rRNA sequences. Fecal 16S rDNA from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six CD patients were used as template to generate fluorescently labeled cRNA that was hybridized to the microarray. Differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with species-specific primer sets. RESULTS: The microarray analyses showed that Eubacterium rectale, Bacteroides fragilis group, B. vulgatus, Ruminococcus albus, R. callidus, R. bromii, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the CD patients, while Enterococcus sp., Clostridium difficile, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, and Listeria sp. were more abundant in the CD group. CONCLUSIONS: The microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum Firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. In addition, the microarray showed that Enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the CD patients. This microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.
TI  - A longitudinal study of infant faecal microbiota during weaning.
AB  - For infants, the introduction of food other than breast milk is a high risk period due to diarrheal diseases, and may be corroborated with a shift in the faecal microbiota. This longitudinal study was the first undertaken to understand the effect of the supplementation on the infant's faecal microbiota and particularly the bifidobacteria. Eleven infants were enrolled. Their faecal microbiota were analysed using temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) with bacterial and bifidobacterial primers. In parallel, bifidobacterial counts were followed using competitive PCR. Three periods were distinguished: exclusive breastfeeding (Bf period), weaning (i.e. formula-milk addition, W period) and postweaning (i.e. breastfeeding cessation, Pw period). The bifidobacterial counts were not modified, reaching 10.5 (Log10 cells g(-1) wet weight). In the TTGE profiles, the main identified bands corresponded to Escherichia coli, Ruminococcus sp. and Bifidobacterium sp., more precisely Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium infantis and Bifidobacterium breve. For both TTGE profiles, the analysis of the distance suggested a maturation of the faecal microbiota but no correlation could be established with the diet. Despite a high interindividual variability, composition of the faecal microbiota appeared more homogenous after weaning and this point may be correlated with the cessation of breastfeeding.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel glucocerebrosidase of Paenibacillus sp. TS12.
AB  - We report here the molecular cloning and characterization of a glucocerebrosidase [EC 3.2.1.45] from Paenibacillus sp. TS12. The open reading frame of the glucocerebrosidase gene consisted of 2,493 bp nucleotides and encoded 831 amino acid residues. The enzyme exhibited no sequence similarity with a classical glucocerebrosidase belonging to glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 30, but rather showed significant similarity with GH family 3 beta-glucosidases from Clostridium thermocellum, Ruminococcus albus, and Aspergillus aculeateus. The recombinant enzyme, expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS, had a molecular weight of 90.7 kDa and hydrolyzed NBD-labeled glucosylceramide, but not galactosylceramide, GM1a or sphingomyelin. The enzyme was most active at pH 6.5, and its apparent Km and Vmax values for NBD-labeled glucosylceramide and p-nitrophenyl-beta-glucopyranoside were 223 microM and 1.60 micromol/min/mg of protein, and 593 microM and 112 micromol/min/mg of protein, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that Asp-223 is an essential amino acid for the catalytic reaction and possibly functions a catalytic nucleophile, as in GH family 3 beta-glucosidases. This is the first report of the molecular cloning and characterization of a glucocerebrosidase from a procaryote.
TI  - Microbial production of hydrogen: an overview.
AB  - Production of hydrogen by anaerobes, facultative anaerobes, aerobes, methylotrophs, and photosynthetic bacteria is possible. Anaerobic Clostridia are potential producers and immobilized C. butyricum produces 2 mol H2/mol glucose at 50% efficiency. Spontaneous production of H2 from formate and glucose by immobilized Escherichia coli showed 100% and 60% efficiencies, respectively. Enterobactericiae produces H2 at similar efficiency from different monosaccharides during growth. Among methylotrophs, methanogenes, rumen bacteria, and thermophilic archae, Ruminococcus albus, is promising (2.37 mol/mol glucose). Immobilized aerobic Bacillus licheniformis optimally produces 0.7 mol H2/mol glucose. Photosynthetic Rhodospirillum rubrum produces 4, 7, and 6 mol of H2 from acetate, succinate, and malate, respectively. Excellent productivity (6.2 mol H2/mol glucose) by co-cultures of Cellulomonas with a hydrogenase uptake (Hup) mutant of R. capsulata on cellulose was found. Cyanobacteria, viz., Anabaena, Synechococcus, and Oscillatoria sp., have been studied for photoproduction of H2. Immobilized A. cylindrica produces H2 (20 ml/g dry wt/h) continually for 1 year. Increased H2 productivity was found for Hup mutant of A. variabilis. Synechococcus sp. has a high potential for H2 production in fermentors and outdoor cultures. Simultaneous productions of oxychemicals and H2 by Klebseilla sp. and by enzymatic methods were also attempted. The fate of H2 biotechnology is presumed to be dictated by the stock of fossil fuel and state of pollution in future.
