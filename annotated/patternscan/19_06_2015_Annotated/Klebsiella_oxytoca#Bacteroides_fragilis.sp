TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between april 2010  and march 2011].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2010 to march 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. such as enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus avium was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. such as streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus spp. such as staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. such as e. faecalis  and e. faecium was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. such as s. aureus from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli and r aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by e. cloacae and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of parvimonas micra, eggerthella lenta, streptococcus constellatus, gemella morbillorum, and collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed.

TI  == nosocomial diarrhea: evaluation and treatment of causes other than clostridium difficile.
AB  == diarrhea is common among hospitalized patients but the causes are distinct from those of diarrhea in the community. we review existing data about the epidemiology of nosocomial diarrhea and summarize recent progress in understanding the mechanisms of diarrhea. clinicians should recognize that most cases of nosocomial diarrhea have a noninfectious etiology, including medications, underlying illness, and enteral feeding. apart from clostridium difficile, the frequency of infectious causes such as norovirus and toxigenic strains of clostridium perfringens, klebsiella oxytoca, staphylococcus aureus, and bacteroides fragilis remains largely undefined and test availability is limited. here we provide a practical approach to the evaluation and management of nosocomial diarrhea when tests for c. difficile are negative.

TI  == susceptibility to tigecycline of isolates from samples collected in hospitalized  patients with secondary peritonitis undergoing surgery.
AB  == activity of tigecycline against nosocomial secondary peritonitis isolates collected along 18 months in 29 spanish hospitals was tested by etest in a central laboratory, considering food and drug administration (fda)/british society for antimicrobial chemotherapy (bsac)/european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) breakpoints. a total of 600 facultative/aerobic isolates (392 gram negative, 208 gram positive) and 100 anaerobes were tested. none of the 220 escherichia coli isolates was resistant to tigecycline (mic(50)/mic(90) = 0.25/0.5 microg/ml), with 0.5% (fda breakpoint) and 3.6% (bsac/eucast breakpoint) intermediate strains. all extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing e. coli isolates (15 strains), all klebsiella pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca isolates (42 strains) were susceptible to tigecycline. no isolates resistant to tigecycline were found among streptococcus  viridans, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecium, but 18.9% of enterococcus faecalis strains were intermediate following bsac/eucast breakpoints. all (but 1) isolates of the bacteroides fragilis group (n = 45) were tigecycline susceptible, as well as gram-positive anaerobes. tigecycline offers an adequate activity profile against isolates from secondary peritonitis when tested by etest regardless of the breakpoints used for categorization.

TI  == infections in patients with aplastic anemia.
AB  == infection is a major cause of death in patients with aplastic anemia (aa). there  are differences between the immunocompromised state of a patient with aa and the  patient who is neutropenic due to chemotherapy and this leads to a difference in  the infections that they incur. prolonged neutropenia is one of the largest risk  factors for the development of infections with the invasive mycoses and bacteria. recovery from neutropenia is directly related to survival, and supportive care plays a large role in protection while the patient is in a neutropenic state. the most common invasive mycoses include the aspergillus species, zygomycetes, candida spp., and fusarium spp. bacterial infections that are seen in patients with aa include gram-positive coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, enterococcus, staphylococus aureus, clostridium spp., micrococcus, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, listeria monocytogenes, and bacillus cereus. gram-negative infections including gram-negative bacilli, escherichia coli, salmonella, bacteroides fragilis, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumonia, aeromonas hydrophilia, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio vulnificus. viral infections are much less common but include those that belong to the herpesviridae family, community-acquired respiratory viral infection, and the viral hepatitides a, b, and c. evidence of the parasite strongyloides stercoralis has also been documented. this review discusses the major invasive fungal infections, bacterial pathogens, parasites, and viral infections that are found in patients with aa who are treated with immunosuppressive therapy. the specific  immune impairment and current treatment parameters for each of these classes of infection will also be discussed.

TI  == advances in defining etiology and new therapeutic approaches in acute diarrhea.
AB  == defining etiology of acute diarrhea is critical to disease therapy and prevention. in this review we look at recent developments in etiologic agents of  acute diarrhea and advances in therapy and prevention of the illness. newly appreciated agents include enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis, klebsiella oxytoca and laribacter hongkongensis. atypical enteropathogenic e. coli (epec) strains lacking the gene for epithelial attachment appear to be more important as causes of diarrhea than traditional epec strains. enterotoxigenic e. coli and enteroaggregative e. coli diarrhea known to be important abroad, have recently been shown to occur in the united states. non-o157:h7 strains of shiga toxin-producing e. coli are increasing and infrequently are being sought. there is currently a serious epidemic of nosocomial diarrhea due to a fluoroquinolone-resistant and more virulent and difficult to treat strain of c. difficile. rotavirus vaccine development should lead to reduction of infant gastroenteritis mortality in infants living in developing regions. noroviruses produce outbreaks of water- and food-borne disease but show broad genetic diversity. reduced osmolarity oral rehydration treatment (ort) and recombinant human lactoferrin/lysozyme plus rice-based ort effectively treat acute diarrhea.  probiotics were shown to be effective in preventing antibiotic associated- and c. difficile-diarrhea. rifaximin prevents and azithromycin effectively treats travelers' diarrhea.

TI  == bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  == treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. it is active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. the aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella ozaenae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers  and non-producers). gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic bacteroides fragilis. ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs). killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the  first few hours of the kinetic curves against e. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (cfu) reduction in the first 2h), b. fragilis (4 log(10) cfu reduction in 4h), mssa (3 log(10) cfu reduction in 4-6h), k. ozaenae (esbl+), k. pneumoniae (esbl+ and -), e. cloacae (esbl-) in 1h and p. mirabilis (esbl+) in the first 2h. the potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of e. coli-b. fragilis and e. coli-b. fragilis-e. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of s. aureus-p. mirabilis. these results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of micro-organisms recovered from cutaneous lesions of human american tegumentary leishmaniasis in minas gerais, brazil.
AB  == an evaluation of the microbiota present in cutaneous ulcers from 31 patients with a clinical and parasitological diagnosis of american tegumentary leishmaniasis (atl) was carried out by the standard filter paper disc technique, including antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacterial isolates. microbial examination indicated that 21 patients (67.7%) were contaminated with one to four bacteria and some of them also with yeast. a total of 142 micro-organisms were isolated. staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently recovered bacterium (95.2% of positive patients) and was found to produce type b (70% of the staphylococcal isolates) and type c (50%) enterotoxins as well as toxic shock syndrome toxin (60%). proteus mirabilis (33.3% of the positive patients), streptococcus pyogenes (19.0 %), h(2)s-negative proteus species (19.0%), klebsiella oxytoca (14.3%), enterobacter species (9.5%), peptostreptococcus species (9.5%), pseudomonas species (4.8%), prevotella bivia (4.8%), escherichia coli (4.8%), streptococcus agalactiae (4.8%), bacteroides fragilis (4.8%), candida albicans (9.5%) and candida tropicalis (4.8%) were also isolated. surprisingly, staph. aureus isolates were susceptible to almost all tested drugs, although some of them were  resistant to penicillin (69%) and ampicillin + sulbactam (68%). concerning obligate anaerobes, all the gram-negative isolates (25% of the total) were resistant to metronidazole. the results of the present study show that microbial  secondary contaminants, particularly staph. aureus, should be considered in the diagnosis and treatment of atl lesions.

TI  == [surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2003].
AB  == for the post-marketing surveillance of cefmetazole (cmz, cefmetazon), mics of injectable beta-lactam antibacterials including cmz against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over japan are measured yearly and the incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. in the first surveillance from june 2000 to march 2001, 574 isolates of 13 species were tested, 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from april 2001 to march 2002, and 654 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the third surveillance from april 2002 to march 2003. no remarkable changes in the activity of cmz were observed in these surveillances spanning three years. the activity of cmz in this study was comparable to that in the studies conducted before cefmetazon was launched. this result suggests that cmz still maintains potent activity. changes in percent resistance of each species to cmz (mic of cmz > or = 32 microg/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa, 0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, 72.9% --> 87.2% --> 88.7%), staphylococcus epidermidis (18.5% --> 31.6% --> 14.3%), coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. (cns, 13.3% --> 18.2% --> 21.4%), escherichia coli (3.6% -->  0.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4% --> 3.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella oxytoca (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), proteus mirabilis (2.3% --> 2.1% --> 0.0%), proteus vulgaris (13.6% --> 6.7% --> 0.0%), morganella morganii (7.3% --> 0.0% --> 14.0%), providencia spp. (12.5% --> 0.0% --> 18.2%), peptostreptococcus spp.  (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), bacteroides fragilis (10.3% --> 10.8% --> 17.1%), bacteroides spp. (78.6% --> 87.5% --> 62.5%). the change in percent resistance of mrsa, other cns, and b. flagiris tended to increase. it is necessary to pay much  attention to trends observed in these species. compared to other drugs tested, against mssa, the activity of cmz was inferior to that of cez, ctm, and fmox and  superior to that sbt/cpz. against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and cns, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and inferior to that of fmox. against b. flagiris and other bacteroides spp., the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and comparable to or inferior to that of sbt/cpz and fmox.

TI  == [surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2002].
AB  == the antibacterial activity of cefmetazole (cmz) against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over japan was evaluated yearly for two years from june  2000 to march 2002 and compared with that of other parenteral beta-lactams, cefazolin (cez), cefotiam (ctm), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and flomoxef (fmox). in the first surveillance from june 2000 to march 2001, 575 isolates of 13 species were tested, and 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from april 2001 to march 2002. in these surveillances spanning two years, the mic90s of cmz against the bacterial species tested hardly differed. changes in percent resistance of each species to cmz (mic of cmz > or = 32 micrograms/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (mssa, 0%-->0%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, 73%-->87%), staphylococcus epidermidis (19%-->32%), other coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. (other cns, 13%-->18%), escherichia coli (4%-->1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3%-->4%), klebsiella oxytoca (0%-->0%), proteus mirabilis (2%-->2%), proteus vulgaris (14%-->7%), morganella morganii (7%-->0%), providencia spp. (17%-->0%),  peptostreptococcus spp. (0%-->0%), bacteroides fragilis (10%-->11%), and other bacteroides spp. (79%-->88%). the change in percent resistance of mrsa, s. epidermidis, other cns, and other bacteroides spp. tended to increase. in addition, the percent resistance of b. fragilis was 10%. it is necessary to pay much attention to the trends observed in these species. compared to other drugs tested, against mssa, the activity of cmz was inferior to that of cez, ctm, and fmox and superior to that of sbt/cpz. against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and cns, the  tested drugs exhibited little activity. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and inferior to that  of fmox. against b. fragilis and other bacteroides spp., the activity of cmz was  almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and comparable to or inferior to that of  sbt/cpz and fmox. no remarkable changes in the activity of cmz were observed in this study compared with studies conducted before cmz was launched. this result suggests that cmz still maintains potent activity.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of ru29246, the active metabolite of hr916b.
AB  == hr 916b is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. in tests its active metabolite, ru29246, inhibited streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the antibacterial activity of cefuroxime, and was more active than cefaclor. it was also more active (mic 2 micrograms/ml) than cefixime, cefuroxime, cefaclor and cefotaxime against staphylococci. ru29246 inhibited escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii and salmonella spp. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, thus being more active than cefuroxime and cefaclor,  but was less active than cefixime and cefotaxime. it did not inhibit pseudomonas  aeruginosa and other pseudomonas spp., enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens or  bacteroides fragilis. ru29246 was not hydrolyzed by tem-1, staphylococcus aureus  tem-2 or moraxella catarrhalis beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by tem-3 and the chromosomal beta-lactamases of proteus vulgaris and morganella morganii. plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases were inhibited by ru29246.

TI  == in vitro activity against clinically important gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of sulbactam, alone and in combination with ampicillin, cefotaxime, mezlocillin, and piperacillin.
AB  == the in vitro effects of the single agents, and the synergistic/antagonistic action of three different combinations of ampicillin (amp, cas 69-53-4), cefotaxime (ctx, cas 63527-52-6), mezlocillin (mez, cas 51481-65-3), and piperacillin (pip, cas 61477-96-1) with the beta-lactamase inhibitor sulbactam (sul, cas 68373-14-8) were determined against 675 gram-positive and gram-negative, both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. all the combinations of sulbactam and the antibiotics (1: 1, 1:2 and 1:4) exhibited very similar synergistic action. the percentage of the total strains tested for which synergistic activity was found was 51% with sul + amp (1:1), 24% with sul + ctx (1:1), 31% with sul + mez (1:1), and 28% with sul + pip (1:1). a fourfold or greater reduction of mic's in the comparison with the antibiotics alone was found with 23% of the total strains tested for the sul + amp, with 9% of the strains tested with sul + ctx, with 11% of the strains tested with sul + mez, and with 15% of the strains tested with the sul + pip-combination. in the presence of sulbactam, 18% of the strains tested showed a significant reduction in the number of resistant strains with ampicillin, 7% with cefotaxime, 16% with mezlocillin, 14% with piperacillin, and in parallel there was an increase in the number of fully susceptible strains (shift from resistant or moderately sensitive to sensitive) by about 14%. in comparison with the antibiotic alone, the most marked reductions in the number of resistant strains on combination with sulbactam were  as follows (the percentage of reduction is shown in brackets): for sul + amp and  acine-tobacter spp. (39% fewer resistant strains). citrobacter spp. (-60%), enterobacter aerogenes (-48%), klebsiella oxytoca (-49%), klebsiella pneumoniae (-63%), morganella morganii (-74%), and proteus vulgaris (-55%); for sul + ctx and acinetobacter spp. (-38%), enterobacter cloacae (-6%), klebsiella pneumoniae  (-16%), serratia marcescens (-9%), and bacteroides fragilis (-31%); for sul + mez and acinetobacter spp. (-68%), citrobacter spp. (-27%), enterobacter spp. (-23%), klebsiella pneumoniae (-32%), and serratia marcescens (-19%); for sul + pip and acinetobacter spp. (-41%), citrobacter spp. (-30%), klebsiella spp. (-30%), and serratia marcescens (-33%).

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == beta-lactamase inhibition by acetylmethylene penicillanic acid compared to that of clavulanate and sulbactam.
AB  == the beta-lactamase inhibitory properties of 6-acetylmethylene penicillanic acid (6-ampa) were investigated and compared with those of other beta-lactamase inhibitors. 6-ampa inhibited the tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, pse-1, pse-2, pse-3, pse-4, oxa-2, oxa-3, and staphylococcus aureus beta-lactamases. it also inhibited the chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases of the richmond-sykes type ia, ic and id type and the type iv klebsiella enzymes. beta-lactamases of branhamella catarrhalis and bacteroides fragilis were inhibited. the 6-ampa i50 values for various enzymes were less than 0.01 microgram/ml tem-1 and pse-4, and 0.01 microgram/ml shv-1, 0.02 microgram/ml s. aureus, 0.04 microgram/ml proteus vulgaris, 0.04 microgram/ml k. oxytoca, 6.8 micrograms/ml p99, and 9.7 micrograms/ml sabath-abraham pseudomonas enzyme. with isolated beta-lactamases 6-ampa was a more potent inhibitor than clavulanate or sulbactam. 6-ampa was an irreversible inhibitor of beta-lactamases. the penetration index for escherichia  coli jt4 was 23 compared to 3 for clavulanate. 6-ampa at 10 micrograms/ml acted synergistically with ampicillin against beta-lactamase containing bacteria, but it was less active than clavulanate and did not act synergistically with ampicillin against enterobacter, citrobacter or pseudomonas. although 6-ampa has  excellent beta-lactamase inhibitory properties with isolated enzymes, it is less  useful with intact organisms.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new penem, cgp 31608.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cgp 31608, a new penem, against aerobic and anaerobic organisms was evaluated and compared with those of other beta-lactams. cgp 31608  inhibited escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, and salmonella, shigella, aeromonas, and yersinia spp. with mics for 50% of the strains (mic50s) of 2 to 4 micrograms/ml and mic90s of 4 micrograms/ml, compared with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and imipenem mics of less than 0.25 microgram/ml. mic90s were 8 micrograms/ml for enterobacter species and c. freundii, for which other agents had mics of 32 micrograms/ml, except imipenem, which had equal activity. the mic90 for proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia stuartii, and providencia rettgeri was 8 micrograms/ml, compared with less than 2 micrograms/ml shown by the other agents. acinetobacter species resistant to other agents except imipenem were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml, as were pseudomonas aeruginosa, including piperacillin-, ceftazidime-, and gentamicin-resistant isolates. the mic for p. cepacia, p. fluorescens, and p. acidovorans was less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, but that for p. maltophilia was greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. hemolytic streptococci a, b, c, g, and f were inhibited by less than 1 micrograms/ml, but the mic for streptococcus faecalis was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. mics for staphylococcus aureus methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, as were those for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant s. epidermidis. bacteroides fragilis and clostridium species and fusobacterium spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. cgp 31608 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, pse-1, oxa-2, pse-4, or by s. aureus. chromosomal beta-lactamases of type ia in enterobacter cloacae p99 and morganella morganii, ic in p. vulgaris, k-1 in k. oxytoca, and id in p. aeruginosa also did not hydrolyze cgp 31608. it inhibited tem-1, but the 50% inhibitory concentration was 14.2 micrograms/ml compared with 0.15 micrograms/ml for the p99 enzyme. cgp 31608 induced beta-lactamases in p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae, c. freundii and providencia rettgeri, but there was no increase in mics for the isolates and it did not select strains derepressed for beta-lactamase production. synergy of cgp 31608 and gentamicin was found against 90% p. aeruginosa, 60% enterobacter cloacae, and 50% serratia marcescens strains. no synergy was found with rifampin. a postantibiotic effect was found against e. coli.

TI  == the activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy 7 beta acyl ureido cephalosporin.
AB  == the activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy ureido cephalosporin, was determined against 726 clinical isolates. ninety percent of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, salmonella, and shigella species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin and piperacillin against these species. concentrations of 25 micrograms/ml of cefbuperazone were needed to inhibit serratia marcescens and providencia species, and 50% of enterobacter cloacae had mics greater than 25 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was less active by 8 to 32-fold than cefotaxime or moxalactam against most enterobacteriaceae. cefbuperazone did not inhibit acinetobacter or pseudomonas species. hemolytic streptococci were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml  and staphylococci by 25 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone had activity comparable to cefoxitin and moxalactam against bacteroides fragilis with mic90s of 6.3 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was not hydrolyzed by plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases and was an inhibitor of the p99 e. cloacae beta-lactamase with an i50 of 1 microgram/ml. it was a less effective inhibitor of the k. oxytoca k1 and e. coli tem-1 beta-lactamases than was clavulanic acid. cefbuperazone induced beta-lactamases in p. aeruginosa and resistant e. cloacae. a permeability barrier in e. cloacae, c. freundii and p. aeruginosa is suggested by the potentiation of  cefbuperazone's activity by edta.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a new n-sulfonated monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a synthetic sulfazecin derivative, were compared with those of aztreonam, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and cefsulodin. carumonam was highly active in vitro against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and haemophilus influenzae and weakly active against streptococcus pneumoniae, but it was not active against staphylococcus aureus. the mics of carumonam for 90% of 1,156 clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates were between 0.013 and 25 micrograms/ml, which were the lowest mics of the antibiotics tested. the mic of carumonam for 90% of klebsiella oxytoca was 0.2 micrograms/ml, whereas that of aztreonam was 50 micrograms/ml. the superiority of carumonam to aztreonam and the reference cephalosporins was also demonstrated by their activities against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. the mic of carumonam for 90% of p. aeruginosa was 12.5 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the mics of aztreonam and ceftazidime. carumonam showed a high affinity for the penicillin-binding protein 3 of gram-negative bacteria, but not for the penicillin-binding proteins of s. aureus and bacteroides fragilis. carumonam was  resistant to hydrolysis by 12 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and 7 chromosomal  beta-lactamases. it was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the beta-lactamase of k. oxytoca; this stability is related to the superiority of the in vitro and in vivo activities of carumonam to those of aztreonam against this species. in general, the protective activities (50% effective dose) of carumonam  and reference antibiotics in mice with experimental intraperitoneal infections correlated with the in vitro activities (mic); carumonam showed excellent protective activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == evaluation of the four-hour micro-id technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative, gram-negative rods from blood cultures.
AB  == a 4-h micro-id technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative gram-negative rods from positive blood cultures was compared to subculture and species identification of single colonies by api 20e and micro-id, using standardized inocula. a total of 127 patients (220 positive cultures) were studied. isolates included 96 escherichia coli, 46 klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 klebsiella oxytoca, 8 enterobacter aerogenes, 17 enterobacter cloacae, 19 serratia marcescens, 2 serratia liquefaciens, 8 proteus mirabilis, 1 salmonella species, 1 morganella morganii, 6 haemophilus influenzae, 2 haemophilus parainfluenzae, 3 bacteroides fragilis, 3 acinetobacter calcoaceticus biotype anitratus, and 1 pseudomonas maltophilia. in 90% of the cultures, identification  by micro-id was identical to that obtained after subculture; if the 15 non-enterobacterial isolates were excluded, the corresponding figure was 96.6%. enterobacteria identified incorrectly by direct micro-id were three s. marcescens (two identified as s. liquefaciens, one as hafnia alvei), two s. liquefaciens (both identified as e. cloacae), and two k. pneumoniae (one identified as klebsiella ozaenae, the other as serratia rubidaea). none of the 15 non-enterobacterial cultures were correctly identified by micro-id (non-identifiable, or classified as providencia/yersinia/klebsiella species). although biochemical discrepancies between direct and final micro-id tests occurred in 41% of the enterobacterial cultures, this did not seriously interfere with identification. direct species identification of enterobacteriaceae from blood cultures by direct micro-id is accurate and easily performed and identified organisms within 4 h compared to at least 24 h by most other methods; the direct  micro-id technique would be rendered even more valuable by the additional capability of identifying non-enterobacterial gram-negative isolates.
