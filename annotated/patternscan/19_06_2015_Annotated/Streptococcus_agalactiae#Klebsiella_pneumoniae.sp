TI  == [analysis of pathogenic bacteria and drug resistance in neonatal purulent meningitis].
AB  == objective: to study the clinical characteristics, pathogenic bacteria, and antibiotics resistance of neonatal purulent meningitis in order to provide the guide for early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. method: a retrospective review was performed and a total of 112 cases of neonatal purulent meningitis (male 64, female 58) were identified in the neonatal intensive care unit of yuying children's hospital of wenzhou medical university seen from january 1, 2004 to december 31, 2013. the clinical information including pathogenic bacterial distribution, drug sensitivity, head imageology and therapeutic outcome were analyzed. numeration data were shown in ratio and chi square test was applied for group comparison. result: among 112 cases, 46 were admitted from 2004 to 2008 and 66 from 2009 to 2013, 23 patients were preterm and 89 were term, 20 were early onset (occurring within 3 days of life) and 92 were late onset meningitis (occurring after 3 days of life). in 62 (55.4%) cases the pathogens were gram-positive bacteria and in 50 (44.6%) were gram-negative bacteria. the five most frequently isolated pathogens were escherichia coli (32 cases, 28.6%),  coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cns, 20 cases, 17.9%), streptococcus (18 cases, 16.1%, streptococcus agalactiae 15 cases), enterococci (13 cases, 11.6%),  staphylococcus aureus (9 cases, 8.0%). comparison of pathogenic bacterial distribution between 2004-2008 and 2009-2013 showed that gram-positive bacteria accounted for more than 50% in both period. escherichia coli was the most common  bacterium, followed by streptococcus in last five years which was higher than the first five years (22.7% (15/66) vs. 6.5% (3/46), chi(2) = 5.278, p < 0.05). klebsiella pneumoniae was more common isolate in preterm infants than in term infants (13.0% (3/23) vs. 1.1% (1/89), chi(2) = 7.540, p < 0.05). streptococcus (most were streptococcus agalactiae) was the most common bacteria in early onset  meningitis and higher than those in late onset meningitis (35.0% (7/20) vs. 12.0% (11/92), chi(2) = 4.872, p < 0.05). drug sensitivity tests showed that all the gram-positive bacterial isolates were sensitive to linezolid. staphylococci were  resistant to penicillin, and most of them were resistant to erythromycin, oxacillin and cefazolin; 77.8%of cns isolates were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus. no streptococcus and enterococcus faecalis was resistant to penicillin. none of enterococci was resistant to vancomycin. among the gram-negative bacterial isolates, more than 40% of escherichia coli were resistant to commonly used cephalosporins such as cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, and all of them were sensitive to amikacin, cefoperazone sulbactam and imipenem. isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae were all resistant to ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, but none of them was resistant to piperacillin tazobactam and imipenem. of the 112 patients, 69 were cured, 23 improved, 9 uncured and 11 died. there were 47 cases (42.0%) with poor prognosis, they had abnormal head imageology, severe complications and some cases died, 13 of 18 (72.2%) patients with meningitis caused by streptococcus died. conclusion:  escherichia coli, cns and streptococcus are the predominant pathogens responsible for neonatal purulent meningitis over the past ten years. there were increasing numbers of cases with streptococcus meningitis which are more common in early onset meningitis with adverse outcome, therefore careful attention should be paid in clinic. linezolid should be used as a new choice in intractable neonatal purulent meningitis cases caused by gram positive bacteria.

TI  == pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluation of ceftaroline fosamil.
AB  == introduction: ceftaroline fosamil is a 5th generation cephalosporin with an in vitro spectrum of activity including streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. aureus, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella oxytoca, k. pneumoniae and moraxella catarrhalis. it is currently approved by the fda for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssi) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (cabp) in adults. areas covered: this review covers the mechanism of action; bacterial resistance; pharmacokinetic characteristics in various patient populations; pharmacodynamic data in animal and in vitro models as well as human studies; efficacy observed in clinical trials for absssi and cabp; and adverse effects. expert opinion: ceftaroline provides in vitro bactericidal activity against methicillin-, vancomycin-, daptomycin-, and linezolid-resistant gram-positive organisms and select gram-negative pathogens. the pharmacodynamics of ceftaroline is similar to other beta-lactam agents. ceftaroline exhibits a favorable adverse effect profile and is generally well tolerated. there is little data on clinical success of ceftaroline in patients with bacteremia or endocarditis other than what has been  published in a small series of case reports. randomized-control studies are needed to establish clinical outcomes and safety in these patient populations.

TI  == establishing a list of qualifying pathogens under the food and drug administration safety and innovation act. final rule.
AB  == the food and drug administration (fda or agency) is issuing a regulation to establish a list of "qualifying pathogens'' that have the potential to pose a serious threat to public health. this final rule implements a provision of the generating antibiotic incentives now (gain) title of the food and drug administration safety and innovation act (fdasia). gain is intended to encourage  development of new antibacterial and antifungal drugs for the treatment of serious or life-threatening infections, and provides incentives such as eligibility for designation as a fast-track product and an additional 5 years of  exclusivity to be added to certain exclusivity periods. based on analyses conducted both in the proposed rule and in response to comments to the proposed rule, fda has determined that the following pathogens comprise the list of ``qualifying pathogens:'' acinetobacter species, aspergillus species, burkholderia cepacia complex, campylobacter species, candida species, clostridium difficile, coccidioides species, cryptococcus species, enterobacteriaceae (e.g.,  klebsiella pneumoniae), enterococcus species, helicobacter pylori, mycobacterium  tuberculosis complex, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, non-tuberculous mycobacteria species, pseudomonas species, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, and vibrio cholerae. the preamble to the  proposed rule described the factors the agency considered and the methodology used to develop the list of qualifying pathogens. as described in the preamble of this final rule, fda applied those factors and that methodology to additional pathogens suggested via comments on the proposed rule.

TI  == colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip test compromising optimised combinations of anti-s. suis capsular polysaccharide polyclonal antibodies for detection of streptococcus suis.
AB  == a rapid diagnosis kit that detects streptococcus suis (s. suis) antigens from urine with an immunochromatographic stripe (ics) test was developed in this study. the ics test was produced using colloidal gold coated with polyclonal antibodies (pabs) against s. suis. the pabs were developed from rabbits immunised with s. suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharides (cps). development of the pabs was investigated to establish their binding to cps and to determine the maximum sensitivity of two combination antibodies for the ics test. the results of the ics optimisation revealed that the combinations of pab c-n1 and pab c-n2 had the  highest sensitivity to cps. the minimum limitation of ics sensitivity indicated 1.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (cfu) and a cps concentration of 0.05 microg. the assay time for detection of s. suis antigens is less than 15 min, which is suitable for rapid detection. a cross-reactive test was also conducted, and it detected no other bacteria (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae). the cross-reactivity of other serotypes in s. suis was also investigated, and tests for serotypes of 1, 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6,  7, 8, 9, 14, and 16 were positive. this study presents the first report of a development of an ics that enables the quantitative detection of streptococcal antigens. the s. suis ics provides several advantages over other methods, including the speed and simplicity of use.

TI  == ceftaroline activity tested against contemporary latin american bacterial pathogens (2011).
AB  == a total of 2484 target bacterial pathogens were collected (one per patient episode) from patients in 16 latin american medical centers located in seven nations during 2011. isolate identity was confirmed at a coordinating laboratory  and susceptibility testing was performed for ceftaroline and comparator agents according to reference broth microdilution methods. a total of 30.0% of isolates  were from respiratory tract, 29.4% from skin and skin structure, 21.4% from blood stream, 7.9% from urinary tract and 11.3% from other sites. ceftaroline was active against staphylococcus aureus (42.8% mrsa) with 83.6% of the isolates at </= 1 mg/l and all isolates at </= 2 mg/l (mic5090, 0.25/2mg/l). national mrsa rates ranged from a low of 28.8% in colombia to a high of 68.1% in chile. all streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae were susceptible to ceftaroline (mic50/90 values were at </= 0.015/</= 0.015 mg/l for both). all streptococcus pneumoniae were susceptible to ceftaroline, linezolid, tigecycline  and vancomycin. susceptibility to ceftriaxone was at 88.4% (clsi non-meningitis interpretive criteria) and 73.9% (clsi meningitis interpretive criteria) for all  s. pneumoniae. ceftriaxone susceptibility was only at 33.3% (clsi non-meningitis  interpretive criteria) and 0.0% (clsi meningitis interpretive criteria) for penicillin-intermediate (penicillin mic, 4 mg/l) strains. all haemophilus influenzae (29.4% beta-lactamase-positive) isolates were susceptible to ceftaroline, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin. for the latin american region, the esbl-phenotype rate was 37.6% for escherichia coli and 53.3% for klebsiella pneumoniae. ceftaroline was not active against esbl-phenotype strains but was active against >90.0% of the non-esbl-phenotype. the spectrum of activity of ceftaroline against pathogens from latin america indicates that it merits further study for its potential use in the latin american region.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the canward surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 canadian hospitals from january 2010 to december 2012. in total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method (document m07-a9, 2012), with mics interpreted by using clsi breakpoints (document m100-s23, 2013). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (mic90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, c. freundii, and h. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to clsi mic interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (p. mirabilis) to 54.0% (s. marcescens). all isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (mic90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity  against staphylococci or streptococci. all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.03 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and streptococcus agalactiae (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. we conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to  third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing e. coli and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == comparison of the epidemiological behavior of mastitis pathogens by applying time-series analysis in results of milk samples submitted for microbiological examination.
AB  == the objective of this study is to examine and compare the trends of mastitis pathogens in quarter milk samples (n = 240,232) submitted for microbiological examination at the milk analysis laboratory (l.i.g.a.l.) at galicia, spain from june 2005 to september 2011. autoregressive integrated moving average (arima) models and multivariate statistical techniques such as cluster analysis were used in order to detect seasonal trends and similarities between the series trends and to classify mastitis pathogens into relatively homogeneous groups. the decrease of bulk milk somatic cell counts achieved by the mastitis control program, developed in recent years in this region, is the result of the decrease in imi caused by a limited number of mastitis pathogens. the obtained results reflect a  greater complexity in the behavior of mastitis pathogens, unlike the traditional  classification into contagious or environmental. staphylococcus aureus showed a trend similar to streptococcus dysgalactiae, a mastitis pathogen can behave in both a contagious and an environmental manner. among the traditionally considered environmental mastitis pathogens, strep. uberis showed a different behavior to escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) species and streptococcus other than strep. agalactiae showed differences in the trend model. time-series analysis and multivariate statistical techniques, such as cluster analysis, could be powerful tools to assess the isolation trend of mastitis pathogens because of their ability to cope with stochastic dependence of consecutive data. furthermore, they could be used to identify the epidemiological behavior of mastitis pathogens using the results of milk samples  submitted for routine microbiological examination, by classifying them into relatively homogeneous groups.

TI  == no change in antibiotic susceptibility patterns in the neonatal icu over two decades.
AB  == objectives: to identify trends in early-onset sepsis and late-onset sepsis neonatal rates and to evaluate the appropriateness of the empirical antibiotic protocols. design: a 17-yr (1993-2009) analysis of positive blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures. setting: the two neonatal icus at the hadassah- hebrew university medical center. results: during this period, 991 infants had at least one episode of either bacteremia or meningitis. the overall incidence of early-onset sepsis was 0.64 per 1,000 live births with a nonsignificant trend over the study period (p = 0.37). the overall incidence of late-onset sepsis was  7.5 per 100 admissions with a significant positive trend in the incidence rates (p = 0.021). the incidence of late-onset sepsis was 7.5 per 100 admissions with a significant positive trend in the prevalence rates (p = 0.021). the prevalence of early-onset group b streptococcus bacteremia decreased significantly throughout the study period. among late-onset sepsis, gram-positive and fungi infection rates were stable over time, while gram-negative infection rates showed a significant positive trend (p = 0.007). no significant change in the susceptibility rate of the isolated gram-negative bacteria in late-onset sepsis for the common antibacterial drugs was found. about 85% and 90% of the isolated organisms were susceptible to our early-onset sepsis (ampicillin and gentamicin)  and late-onset sepsis (vancomycin and cefotaxime) protocols, respectively, and these rates were stable over the study period (p = .1 and .55, respectively). sepsis-related mortality was higher among gram- negative sepsis cases resistant to our empiric antibiotic protocol. conclusions: our empiric antibiotic protocols are appropriate despite their continuous use over the last 17 yrs. this may have  been achieved by the use of a controlled antibiotic program and infection control efforts.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of black thyme (thymbra spicata l.) essential oils.
AB  == in order to study antimicrobial effects of essential oils of wild thyme (thymbra  spicata l.) on two gram positive bacteria (streptococcus agalactiae rjttc1978 and staphylococcus aureus rjttc1885) and two gram negative bacteria (escherichia coli rjttc2409 and klebsiella pneumoniae rjttc1097), the research carried out with five concentrations (0.2, 2, 4, 10 and 20 microl) using disk diffusion and microbroth dilution (to determine mic and mbc) methods at ilam university during  2010. tetracycline and gentamicin discs were used as control. chemical composition of the eos was analyzed by gc-ms. antioxidant activity of the essential oils (eos) was measured following dpph assay. results showed that carvacrol (60.36%), gamma-terpinene (15.09%), beta-myrcene (2.15%), trans-caryophyllene (1.78%) and alpha-thujene (1.54%) were the main components of the oils. evaluation of antimicrobial activity revealed that the oils were active against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria. however, the biggest growth inhibitory zone (33.34 +/- 0.5 mm) was recorded on streptococcus agalactiae at 20 microl/ml concentration. the lowest mic (3.12 microl/ml) observed for klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus agalactiae, while minimum mbc (6.25 microl/ml) recorded on klebsiella pneumoniae. radical-scavenging ability of the eos and bht ranged from 9.93 +/- 2.57 to 77.81 +/- 1.3% and 80.48  +/- 0.56 to 10.66 +/- 1.11%, respectively. the inhibiting effect of thymbra oils  was stronger than the synthetic bht, particularly at lower concentrations, as ic50 concentration of eos for the reduction of dpph radicals was 1.28 microl/ml which was lower than ic50 calculated for bht (1.31 microl/ml). the total phenolic content, determined according to the folin-ciocalteu method, was 1.52 +/- 0.15 mg pye/ml eos.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == maternal hiv infection and vertical transmission of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: hiv-exposed newborns may be at higher risk of sepsis because of immune system aberrations, impaired maternal antibody transfer and altered exposure to pathogenic bacteria. methods: we performed a secondary analysis of a  study (clinicaltrials.gov, number nct00136370) conducted between april 2004 and october 2007 in south africa. we used propensity score matching to evaluate the association between maternal hiv infection and (1) vaginal colonization with bacterial pathogens; (2) vertical transmission of pathogens to the newborn; and (3) sepsis within 3 days of birth (eos) or between 4-28 days of life (los). results: colonization with group b streptococcus (17% vs 23%, p = .0002), escherichia coli (47% vs 45%, p = .374), and klebsiella pneumoniae (7% vs 10%, p  = .008) differed modestly between hiv-infected and uninfected women, as did vertical transmission rates. maternal hiv infection was not associated with increased risk of neonatal eos or los, although culture-confirmed eos was >3 times higher among hiv-exposed infants (p = .05). when compared with hiv-unexposed, neonates, hiv-exposed, uninfected neonates (heu) had a lower risk  of eos (20.6 vs 33.7 per 1000 births; p = .046) and similar rate of los (5.8 vs 4.1; p = .563). hiv-infected newborns had a higher risk than heu of eos (134 vs 21.5; p < .0001) and los (26.8 vs 5.6; p = .042). conclusions: maternal hiv infection was not associated with increased risk of maternal bacterial colonization, vertical transmission, eos, or los. hiv-infected neonates, however, were at increased risk of eos and los.

TI  == chemical composition of 8 eucalyptus species' essential oils and the evaluation of their antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities.
AB  == background: in 1957, tunisia introduced 117 species of eucalyptus; they have been used as fire wood, for the production of mine wood and to fight erosion. actually, eucalyptus essential oil is traditionally used to treat respiratory tract disorders such as pharyngitis, bronchitis, and sinusitis. a few investigations were reported on the biological activities of eucalyptus oils worldwide. in tunisia, our previous works conducted in 2010 and 2011 had been the first reports to study the antibacterial activities against reference strains. at that time it was not possible to evaluate their antimicrobial activities against  clinical bacterial strains and other pathogens such as virus and fungi. methods:  the essential oils of eight eucalyptus species harvested from the jbel abderrahman, korbous (north east tunisia) and souinet arboreta (north of tunisia) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities by disc diffusion and microbroth dilution methods against seven bacterial isolates: haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. in addition, the bactericidal, fungicidal and the antiviral activities of the tested oils were carried out. results: twenty five components were identified by gc/fid  and gc/ms. these components were used to correlate with the biological activities of the tested oils. the chemical principal component analysis identified three groups, each of them constituted a chemotype. according to the values of zone diameter and percentage of the inhibition (zdi, % i, respectively), four groups and subgroups of bacterial strains and three groups of fungal strains were characterized by their sensitivity levels to eucalyptus oils. the cytotoxic effect and the antiviral activity varied significantly within eucalyptus species  oils. conclusions: e. odorata showed the strongest activity against s. aureus, h. influenzae, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae and against all the tested  fungal strains. in addition, e. odorata oil showed the most cytotoxic effect. however, the best antiviral activity appeared with e. bicostata. virus pretreatment with e. bicostata essential oil showed better antiviral activity (ic(50) = 0.7 mg/ml, si = 22.8) than cell-pretreatment (ic(50) = 4.8 mg/ml, si =  3.33). the essential oil of e. astringens showed antiviral activity only when incubated with virus prior to cell infection. this activity was dose-dependent and the antiviral activity diminished with the decreasing essential oil concentration.

TI  == gender and age-dependent etiology of community-acquired urinary tract infections.
AB  == urinary tract infections (utis) are among the most frequent community-acquired infections worldwide. escherichia coli is the most common uti pathogen although underlying host factors such as patients' age and gender may influence prevalence of causative agents. in this study, 61 273 consecutive urine samples received over a 22-month period from outpatients clinics of an urban area of north italy underwent microbiological culture with subsequent bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of positive samples. a total of 13 820 uropathogens were isolated and their prevalence analyzed according to patient's gender and age group. overall escherichia coli accounted for 67.6% of all isolates, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (8.8%), enterococcus faecalis (6.3%), proteus mirabilis (5.2%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%). data stratification  according to both age and gender showed e. coli isolation rates to be lower in both males aged >/=60 years (52.2%), e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa being more prevalent in this group (11.6% and 7.8%, resp.), as well as in those aged </=14 years (51.3%) in whom p. mirabilis prevalence was found to be as high as 21.2%. streptococcus agalactiae overall prevalence was found to be 2.3% although it was  shown to occur most frequently in women aged between 15 and 59 years (4.1%). susceptibility of e. coli to oral antimicrobial agents was demonstrated to be as  follows: fosfomycin (72.9%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (72.9%), ciprofloxacin (76.8%), ampicillin (48.0%), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (77.5%). in conclusion,  both patients' age and gender are significant factors in determining utis etiology; they can increase accuracy in defining the causative uropathogen as well as providing useful guidance to empiric treatment.

TI  == sensitivities of major causative organisms isolated from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis against various antibacterial agents: results of subanalysis based on the presence of menopause.
AB  == we investigated whether the presence of menopause influenced the species and distribution of causative bacteria isolated from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis (the most common urinary tract infection), and we also investigated the sensitivity of the isolated species to antibacterial agents. using multivariate analysis, we also investigated risk factors for infection with quinolone-resistant escherichia coli, because its frequency has increased and it  is now a clinical problem in japan. six hundred and thirty-four strains were isolated from 489 premenopausal patients (mean age 32.3 +/- 10.1 years). major causative bacteria detected were escherichia coli (65.0 %), enterococcus faecalis (12.0 %), streptococcus agalactiae (5.5 %), and klebsiella pneumoniae (1.6 %). from 501 postmenopausal patients (mean age 68.7 +/- 10.29 years), 657 strains were isolated, and the major causative bacteria detected were e. coli (61.5 %), e. faecalis (13.7 %), k. pneumoniae (5.2 %), and s. agalactiae (4.0 %). the sensitivities to fluoroquinolones (fqs) and cephems of e. coli isolated from premenopausal patients were both >/=90 %, while the sensitivities to fqs of e. coli isolated from postmenopausal patients were about 5 % lower. in regard to infection with quinolone-resistant e. coli (minimal inhibitory concentration of levofloxacin [lvfx] >/=4 mug/ml), significant risk factors were observed in patients with more than two episodes of cystitis within a year (p = 0.0002), patients to whom antibacterial agents were used previously for this episode of cystitis (p = 0.0175), and patients who had a history of fq administration within 1 month. although the species and distribution of causative bacteria of acute uncomplicated cystitis were the same regardless of the presence of menopause, the sensitivities to fqs of e. coli detected in postmenopausal patients were significantly lower than those in the premenopausal women. the major risk factors for infection with quinolone-resistant e. coli were a history of fq administration and the morbidity of cystitis rather than the menopausal status. it was considered that taking an appropriate history including the morbidity of cystitis and history of fq administration, and the appropriate selection of an antibacterial agent, would be important when empirical therapy is required.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of mastitis pathogens of dairy cattle and comparative relevance to humans.
AB  == mastitis, inflammation of the mammary gland, can be caused by a wide range of organisms, including gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, mycoplasmas and algae. many microbial species that are common causes of bovine mastitis, such as  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus also occur as commensals or pathogens of humans whereas other causative species, such as streptococcus uberis, streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae or staphylococcus chromogenes, are almost exclusively found in animals. a wide range of molecular typing methods have been used in the past two decades to investigate the epidemiology of bovine mastitis at the subspecies  level. these include comparative typing methods that are based on electrophoretic banding patterns, library typing methods that are based on the sequence of selected genes, virulence gene arrays and whole genome sequencing projects. the strain distribution of mastitis pathogens has been investigated within individual animals and across animals, herds, countries and host species, with consideration of the mammary gland, other animal or human body sites, and environmental sources. molecular epidemiological studies have contributed considerably to our understanding of sources, transmission routes, and prognosis for many bovine mastitis pathogens and to our understanding of mechanisms of host-adaptation and  disease causation. in this review, we summarize knowledge gleaned from two decades of molecular epidemiological studies of mastitis pathogens in dairy cattle and discuss aspects of comparative relevance to human medicine.

TI  == rapid identification of bovine mastitis pathogens by high-resolution melt analysis of 16s rdna sequences.
AB  == accurate identification of mastitis pathogens is often compromised when using conventional culture-based methods. here, we report a novel, rapid assay tested for speciation of bacterial mastitis pathogens using high-resolution melt analysis (hrma) of 16s rdna sequences. real-time pcr amplification of 16s rrna gene fragment, spanning the variable region v5 and v6 was performed with a resulting amplicon of 290bp. first, a library was generated of melt curves of 9 common pathogens that are implicated in bovine mastitis. six of the isolates, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus  uberis, staphylococcus aureus and mycoplasma bovis, were type strains while the other 3, arcanobacterium pyogenes, corynebacterium bovis and streptococcus dysgalactiae, were bovine mastitis field isolates. four of the type strains, e. coli, s. agalactiae, k. pneumoniae and s. aureus, were found to be of human origin, while the other 3 type strains were isolated from bovine infections. secondly, the melt curves and corresponding amplicon sequences of a. pyogenes, e. coli, s. agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae, k. pneumoniae, s. uberis and s. aureus were compared with 10 bovine mastitis field isolates of each pathogen. based on the distinct differences in melt curves and sequences between human and bovine isolates of e. coli and k. pneumoniae, it was deemed necessary to select a set of bovine strains for these pathogens to be used as reference strains in the hrma. next, the hrma was validated by three interpreters analyzing the differential clustering pattern of melt curves of 60 bacterial cultures obtained from mastitis milk samples. the three test interpreters were blinded to the culture and sequencing results of the isolates. overall accuracy of the validation assay was  95% as there was difficulty in identifying the streptococci due to heterogeneity  observed in the pcr amplicons of s. uberis. the present study revealed that broad-range real-time pcr with hrma can be used as a powerful, fast and low-cost  tool for the differentiation of clinically important bacterial mastitis pathogens.

TI  == susceptibility of bacterial isolates from community-acquired infections in sub-saharan africa and asia to macrolide antibiotics.
AB  == objective: to review the literature on the susceptibility of common community pathogens in sub-saharan africa and asia to the macrolide antibiotics. methods: inclusion criteria required that isolates were collected since 2004 to ensure results were of contemporary relevance. the data were aggregated by region, age group and sterility of site of culture sample. results: a total of 51 studies were identified, which reported the macrolide antimicrobial susceptibilities of common bacterial pathogens isolated since 2004. in general, there was less macrolide resistance in african than in asian isolates. most african studies reported high levels of macrolide susceptibility in streptococcus pneumoniae, whereas most chinese studies reported high levels of resistance. there was very little information available for gram-negative organisms. conclusions: susceptibility of the pneumococcus to macrolides in ssa remains high in many areas, and good activity of azithromycin has been shown against salmonellae spp.  in asia. in urban areas where high antibiotic consumption is prevalent, there was evidence of increased resistance to macrolides. however, there is no information  on susceptibility from large areas in both continents.

TI  == assessment of an extraction protocol to detect the major mastitis-causing pathogens in bovine milk.
AB  == despite all efforts to control its spread, mastitis remains the most costly disease for dairy farmers worldwide. one key component of better control of this  disease is identification of the causative bacterial agent during udder infections in cows. mastitis is complex, however, given the diversity of pathogens that must be identified. development of a rapid and efficient bacterial species identification tool is thus necessary. this study was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of bacterial dna extraction for the automated molecular detection of major mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples  to complement traditional microbiological identification. extraction and detection procedures were designed and optimized to achieve detection in a respectable time frame, at a reasonable cost, and with a high throughput capacity. the following species were identified: staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, and klebsiella spp. (including klebsiella oxytoca and klebsiella pneumoniae). the detection procedure includes specific genomic dna amplification  by multiplex pcr for each species, separation by capillary electrophoresis, and laser-assisted automated detection. the specificity of the primers was assessed with a panel of bacteria representing mastitis-negative control species. the extraction protocol comprised multiple steps, starting with centrifugation for fat removal, followed by heating in the presence of a cation exchange resin to trap divalent ions. the analytical sensitivity was 100 cfu/ml for milk samples spiked with staph. aureus, strep. dysgalactiae, and e. coli, with a tendency for  k. pneumoniae. the detection limit was 500 cfu/ml for strep. uberis and strep. agalactiae. the overall diagnostic sensitivity (95.4%) and specificity (97.3%) were determined in a double-blind randomized assay by processing 172 clinical milk samples with microbiological characterization as the gold standard. when the physical nature of the milk samples was too altered, dna purification with a magnetic bead-based system was used. of the apparent false-positive samples, 5 were identified by specific microbiological analysis as true-positive staph. aureus co-infections, with further confirmation by ribosomal 16s sequencing. the  proposed methodology could, therefore, become an interesting tool for automated pcr detection of major mastitis pathogens in dairy cattle.

TI  == the establishment of resistance phenotypes for bacteria isolated from outpatients in urine cultures.
AB  == from 1911 outpatients, who addressed a timisoara private clinical laboratory, from january to december 2005, we collected 1,889 urine cultures, 431 being positive. bacteria identification was generally done using morphological, cultural, biochemical characters and pathogenicity tests. sensitivity testing to  antimicrobial medical drugs was done by using the classical diffusion kirby-bauer method and the automatic analyzer osiris, also. the main bacteria involved in the etiology of these infections were represented by enterobacteriaceae, head of the  list being escherichia coli (81.21%), followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (8.35%) and proteus mirabilis (3.02%). we also isolated gram positive cocci (in a much smaller proportion), mainly represented by enterococcus faecalis (1.16%), staphylococcus aureus (0.93%), streptococcus agalactiae, and also gram negative non-fermentative bacilli, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.93%) or acinetobacter baumanii (0.23%). as soon as we performed the sensitivity tests, we divided them  in resistance phenotypes: most of the enterobacteriaceae were integrated in the wild phenotype, followed by the penicillinase producing phenotype. an e. coli strain (0.29%) and 3 klebsiella pneumoniae strains (8.33%) were integrated in the large spectrum, multidrug resistant, beta-lactamase producing phenotype, also associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides; non-fermentative bacilli did not present special resistance problems, the four pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were integrated in the wild phenotype (secreting induced chromosomal cephalosporinase). as for staphylococcus aureus it was identified a strain having fluoroquinolone resistance, two strains secreting penicillinase and having a k (nm) phenotype and a strain secreting penicillinase  only. antibiotic resistance represents a major concern for patients, physicians,  healthcare managers, and policymakers. the use of antibiotics is closely linked with the development of acquired antibiotic resistance.

TI  == prevention of transfusion of platelet components contaminated with low levels of  bacteria: a comparison of bacteria culture and pathogen inactivation methods.
AB  == background: this study compared the efficacy of bacterial detection with inactivation for reducing the risk associated with transfusion of platelet (plt)  components contaminated with low levels of bacteria. study design and methods: twenty-one double-dose plts were spiked with seven species of bacteria at three levels (0.003-0.03, 0.03-0.3, 0.3-3 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml). after split, each plt unit contained 1 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000 cfus. one unit was photochemically treated (pct; 150 micromol/l amotosalen and 3 j/cm(2) ultraviolet a). the other unit was untreated. all units were stored and sampled on days 1, 2, and 5 of storage for aerobic and anaerobic culture in the bact/alert system (biomerieux). plts were classified as sterile when no bacterial growth was detected after 120 hours of culture. results: in all pct plts, no bacteria were detected throughout 5 days of storage regardless of species, level of contamination, and sampling time. in untreated plts, staphylococcus aureus was consistently detected by culturing. growth of 1 to 10 cfus per unit staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 to 100 cfus per unit of klebsiella pneumoniae, and  1 to 1000 cfus per unit propionibacterium acnes was delayed and only detectable after 5, 2, and 5 days of storage, respectively. low levels of streptococcus agalactiae (1-10 cfus/unit), escherichia coli (1-100 cfus/unit), and clostridium  perfringens (1-100 cfus/unit) were not detected during 5 days of storage, although bacterial outgrowth was detected at higher levels of contamination. conclusions: for the seven bacterial species examined, contaminated plts may be released for transfusion on test-negative-to-date status. in contrast, bacterial  inactivation by pct could reduce the risk associated with transfusion of plts contaminated with low levels of these bacteria.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == comparison of bactec plus blood culture media to bact/alert fa blood culture media for detection of bacterial pathogens in samples containing therapeutic levels of antibiotics.
AB  == blood culture bottles with antimicrobial removal systems are recommended for patients who develop fever while on antibiotics. this study compared the ability  of becton dickinson (sparks, md) bactec plus bottles and biomerieux (durham, nc)  bact/alert fa bottles to effectively remove vancomycin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin, oxacillin, gentamicin, and a combination of gentamicin/penicillin, thus allowing bacterial pathogens to grow.  each bottle was spiked with 10 ml of human blood, antibiotic, and strains of organisms susceptible to the antibiotic evaluated. the organisms used were type strains and clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible and resistant), streptococcus pneumoniae, a viridans streptococcus, enterococcus  faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. testing was completed in triplicate, using 10 to 100 cfu/ml of organisms with various concentrations of each antibiotic. two rounds of testing were completed per antibiotic/organism combination. bottles were mixed and loaded onto their respective instruments as per the manufacturer's instructions. antimicrobial removal was evaluated on the basis of time to detection of organism growth, for up to 5 days of incubation. overall, the bact/alert fa system recovered 25.1% of strains from test bottles and 96.9% of strains from growth control bottles (no antibiotic added), and the bactec plus system recovered 95.1% of strains from test bottles and 100% of strains from growth control bottles. both systems performed well in the detection of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of gentamicin. in the presence of ceftriaxone, neither system was able to recover streptococcus pneumoniae. the ability to remove vancomycin and cefoxitin was also determined by measuring antibiotic levels remaining in bottles after 1 h of incubation. the results demonstrated remaining levels of 72 to 90% of vancomycin and 71 to 72% of cefoxitin in the bact/alert system. for the bactec system, remaining levels were 0 to 30% of vancomycin and 0% of cefoxitin. under these simulated conditions, the bactec plus system was superior to the bact/alert fa system in recovering gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics, gentamicin/penicillin, and vancomycin.

TI  == spectrum and antibiotic resistance of uropathogens isolated from hospital and community patients with urinary tract infections in two large hospitals in kuwait.
AB  == objectives: to determine the spectrum of microbial etiology and antibiotic resistance pattern of the uropathogens that cause urinary tract infections in 2 large teaching hospitals in kuwait over a period of 1 year. materials and methods: the vitek identification card system was used to identify the uropathogens. susceptibility of the isolates against 18 antibiotics was performed by the microbroth dilution method using the vitek automated system. in addition,  gram-positive bacteria were tested in parallel by the disk diffusion technique. results: the six overall most common isolates were: escherichia coli, accounting  for 47% of isolates in both hospitals, followed by candida spp. (10.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (9.6%), streptococcus agalactiae (gbs; 9.5%), enterococcus  faecalis (4.2%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.1%). amikacin provided the widest coverage amongst all the antibiotics tested followed by ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and piperacillin-tazobactam. for the gram-negatives, high resistance (26-63%) to  the beta-lactam antibiotics was noted, especially to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cephalothin and cefuroxime. resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was also high. none of the enterococci was resistant to the glycopeptides, but 38-60% of the staphylococcus haemolyticus were resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin. conclusion: these data show the high level of antimicrobial resistance amongst the uropathogens causing urinary tract  infection in the two hospitals studied.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of oral cephems against various clinically isolated strains and evaluation of efficacy based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics theory].
AB  == we compared the antimicrobial activity of commercially available oral cephem agents, cefaclor (ccl), cefroxadine (cxd), cefdinir (cfdn), cefixime (cfix), cefpodoxime (cpdx), cefteram (cftm), cefcapene (cfpn), and cefditoren (cdtr), against streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and esbl-producing bacteria isolated from clinical materials in kansai medical university hospital between 2002 and 2003. based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (pk/pd) theory, we determined the concentration of each agent at which the time above mic (tam) value was 40% or more, and calculated the rate of efficacy against each type of bacteria. in s. pneumoniae strains, the mic(50,80,90) values of cdtr were 0.25, 0.5, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, lower than those of the other agents, demonstrating the  most potent antimicrobial activity. however, the efficacy rate for cdtr calculated based on the pk/pd theory was 58.5%. cftm showed the highest efficacy  rate (66.1%). in h. influenzae strains, the antimicrobial activity of cdtr was most potent, followed by that of cftm and that of cfpn/cfix. the mic90 value of cdtr was lowest (0.25 microg/ml), followed by that of cftm (0.5 microg/ml). the efficacy rate for cdtr was 100%. this result supports that cdtr frequently eradicates h. influenzae. in e. coli strains, the mic90 values of the above agents, excluding ccl and cxd, ranged from 0.5 to 1 microg/ml. the antimicrobial  activity of cfix against k. pneumoniae was most potent, followed by that of cfdn/cpdx and that of cftm. in esbl-producing bacteria, most agents showed an mic90 value of more than 4 microg/ml. in s. agalactiae and s. pyogenes strains, all of the agents showed satisfactory mic values. in methi- cillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa) strains, cfdn and cxd showed a high efficacy rate, whereas the efficacy rates for the other agents were low. the frequent use of oral agents has increased the number of cephem-resistant bacteria. esbl-producing bacteria become highly resistant, and the presence or absence of response can be  readily evaluated. however, when a mutation of penicillin-binding protein (pbp) occurs, drug resistance is less marked. therefore, it is difficult to evaluate the treatment response in many cases. in s. pneumoniae strains, the efficacy rates for all of the agents were low in the evaluation using the pk/pd theory, suggesting that a dose higher than the standard dose should be established. thus, in the future, the efficacy should be evaluated based on the pk/pd theory, appropriate antimicrobial treatment should be administered, and the administration method that does not increase the number of resistant bacteria must be established.

TI  == prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from central nervous  system specimens as reported by u.s. hospital laboratories from 2000 to 2002.
AB  == background: bacterial infections of the central nervous system, especially acute  infections such as bacterial meningitis require immediate, invariably empiric antibiotic therapy. the widespread emergence of resistance among bacterial species is a cause for concern. current antibacterial susceptibility data among central nervous system (cns) pathogens is important to define current prevalence  of resistance. methods: antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from cns specimens was analyzed using the surveillance database (tsn) usa database which gathers routine antibiotic susceptibility data from >300 us hospital laboratories. a total of 6029 organisms derived from cns specimen sources during  2000-2002, were isolated and susceptibility tested. results: staphylococcus aureus (23.7%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (11.0%) were the most common gram-positive pathogens. gram-negative species comprised approximately 25% of isolates. the modal patient age was 1 or <1 year for most organisms. prevalence of mrsa among s. aureus from cerebrospinal fluid (csf) and brain abscesses were 29.9-32.9%. penicillin resistance rates were 16.6% for s. pneumoniae, 5.3% for viridans group streptococci, and 0% for s. agalactiae. for csf isolates, ceftriaxone resistance was s. pneumoniae (3.5%), e. coli (0.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (2.8%), serratia marcescens (5.6%), enterobacter cloacae (25.0%), haemophilus influenzae (0%). listeria monocytogenes and n. meningitidis are not routinely susceptibility tested. conclusions: resistance is commonly detected, albeit still at relatively low levels for key drugs classes such as third-generation cephalosporins. this data demonstrates the need to consider predominant resistance phenotypes when choosing empiric therapies to treat cns infections.

TI  == comparison of the microbicidal and muramidase activities of mouse lysozyme m and  p.
AB  == lysozyme is one of the most abundant antimicrobial proteins in the airspaces of the lung. mice express two lysozyme genes, lysozyme m and p, but only the m enzyme is detected in abundance in lung tissues. disruption of the lysozyme m locus significantly increased bacterial burden and mortality following intratracheal infection with a gram-negative bacterium. unexpectedly, significant lysozyme enzyme activity (muramidase activity) was detected in the airspaces of uninfected lysozyme m-/- mice, amounting to 25% of the activity in wild-type mice. muramidase activity in lysozyme m-/- mice was associated with increased lysozyme p mrna and protein in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid respectively. the muramidase activity of recombinant lysozyme p was less than that of recombinant m lysozyme. recombinant p lysozyme was also less effective in killing selected gram-negative bacteria, requiring higher concentrations than lysozyme m to achieve the same level of killing. the lower antimicrobial activity of p lysozyme, coupled with incomplete compensation by p lysozyme in lysozyme m-/- mice, probably accounts for the increased susceptibility of null mice to infection. recombinant lysozyme m and p were equally effective in killing selected gram-positive organisms. this outcome suggests that disruption of both m and p loci would significantly increase susceptibility to airway infections, particularly those associated with colonization by gram-positive organisms.

TI  == bacterial polysaccharides as vaccines--immunity and chemical characterization.
AB  == studies on protective immunity and biochemical characterization of bacterial capsular polysaccharides have led to significant contributions to understanding of the mechanisms of infectious diseases and development of effective vaccines. immunity to encapsulated bacteria is related to antibody response to polysaccharide (ps) antigen, interactions with t- and b-lymphocytes, and host defense mechanisms. meningococcal, pneumococcal and salmonella vi pss and haemophilus type b ps-protein conjugate vaccines have been licensed and provided  effective immunity for prevention of these bacterial infections. capsular pss are cell-surface polymers consisting of oligosaccharide repeating units. many pss are highly polar and hydrophilic and interfere with cell-to-cell interactions with phagocytes. most pneumococcal pss are negatively charged and possess acidic components such as d-glucuronic acid and phosphate in phosphodiester bonds. extensive immunologic cross-reactivity has been observed among bacterial capsular pss. in infants the antibody responses to most capsular pss are generally poor. enhanced immunogenicity of ps antigens can be achieved through ps-protein conjugate vaccines, immunization during a critical period of perinatal development and effective antigen delivery system.

AB  == we have designed a universal pcr capable of amplifying a portion of the 16s rrna  gene of eubacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. the sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most pcr products generated by haeiii digestion were different. pcr products from s. aureus and s. epidermidis could not be digested by haeiii but yielded different patterns when they were digested with mnli. pcr products from s. pneumoniae, e. faecium, and e. faecalis yielded the same haeiii digestion pattern but could be differentiated by alui digestion. pcr  products from e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and e. cloacae also had the  same haeiii digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with ddei  or bstbi. this universal pcr could detect as few as 10 e. coli or 250 s. aureus organisms. compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal pcr for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. these results suggest that this universal pcr coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the usa.
AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

TI  == multilocus enzyme analysis in aerobic and anaerobic bacteria using gel electrophoresis-nitrocellulose blotting.
AB  == an optimized multilocus enzyme electrophoresis method, which involves polyacrylamide-agarose gel electrophoresis followed by electrophoretic transfers  on nitrocellulose sheets, was developed for the analysis of enzyme polymorphism in several aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, klebsiella pneumoniae and k. oxytoca, clostridium bifermentans and c. sordellii, and prevotella bivia. serial  electrophoretic transfers (during 5-15 min each) from a single polyacrylamide gel could be achieved for most enzymes studied, and allowed an increased definition of enzyme bands on nitrocellulose as compared to migration gels. four enzymes, which could not be blotted in such conditions, could still be stained in gels after blotting. thus, the method allowed the combined analysis of several enzymes after a single gel electrophoresis separation. the analysis of enzyme polymorphism in the various species studied raised the interest of polymorphic loci such as esterase or glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase for epidemiologic studies. the method characterized a genetic diversity of enzyme loci of s. pneumoniae higher than previously reported, and is thus convenient for the analysis of genetic relationships between related isolates. since the present method reduces the tediousness of multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and requires  experimental conditions that are not specific for the bacterial population studied, it may be proposed for rapid population genetics analysis of a wide variety of bacteria.

TI  == pyogenic psoas abscess: analysis of 27 cases.
AB  == from 1993 to 1998, 29 pyogenic psoas abscesses occurring in 27 patients were seen in taichung veterans general hospital. their age range was 25 to 85 years. diabetes mellitus was the leading underlying disease. fever and pain in the flank area, back and hip were the usual manifestations. the duration of symptoms prior  to the diagnosis ranged from 3 days to 6 months. most abscesses were diagnosed by computed tomography (ct) images and proven by abscess cultures, which were divided into primary and secondary types. eighteen of 29 abscesses were regarded  as primary. staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen in the primary abscesses, followed by streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, viridans streptococci, s. epidermidis, and salmonella spp.. in the secondary abscess category, e. coli was the leading organism in this series, followed by s. aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, viridans streptococci and candida albicans. the associated conditions included epidural abscess, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, perirenal  abscess, pulmonary tuberculosis, empyema, hydronephrosis and trauma history. the  initial empiric therapy comprised mostly of cefazolin or oxacillin with or without an aminoglycoside. thirteen patients underwent percutaneous drainage, while six received surgical debridement, including two with a recurrent abscess.  one patient had both drainage and debridement. others received medical treatment  only. two of the patients with primary abscess died in spite of percutaneous drainage. therefore, open drainage, besides appropriate antibiotic treatment, is  still required to control complex abscesses with sepsis.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro activity of fk041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with  those of cefdinir (cfdn) and cefditoren (cdtr). fk041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk041 was active against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms  except enterococcus faecalis with mic90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. fk041 was more active than cfdn and cdtr against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to cfdn and cdtr against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. fk041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae with an mic range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to cfdn but inferior to cdtr. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative organisms such as neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, fk041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of cfdn and cdtr. however, it was inferior to cdtr in activity against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, morganella morganii, and serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. with fk041 a small difference between mic and mbc against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. fk041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. the stability of fk041 to these enzymes was similar to those of cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of s. aureus (pbp 3, 2, and 1) and e. coli (pbp 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).

TI  == bacterial meningitis in the newborn: a prospective study of mortality and morbidity.
AB  == neonatal bacterial meningitis is a serious disease around the world, with the incidence changing little in the past 30 years. group b streptococci, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae are common causative organisms and lumbar puncture remains the definitive method of diagnosis. the mortality rate has declined in industrialized countries over the years, from almost 50% in the 1970s to less than 10% in 1997. however, neurological sequelae are still frequently observed despite major changes in treatment. preliminary analysis of our own data from a prospective study of cases in the united kingdom suggests that treatment with third generation cephalosporins is related to a decrease in mortality but not morbidity.

AB  == cefepime and cefpirome are new beta-lactamase resistant parenteral cephalosporin  derivatives whose spectrum of activity makes them suitable for use in the treatment of severe infections such as bacterial meningitis. however, the published information on the penetration of these new agents into human csf and on their use in the treatment of bacterial meningitis are really scarce. experimental studies have shown that cefepime and cefpirome penetrated remarkably well into the csf of animals infected with streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae type b or pseudomonas aeruginosa. the mean changes in bacterial colony count in csf after cefpirome or cefepime administration express the antibacterial activity of these drugs. studies in patients show that cefepime and cefpirome crossed the blood-brain barrier and reached concentrations in the csf that are bactericidal against most potential pathogens. higher levels are likely to be achieved with multiple dosing and in the presence of inflamed meninges. no study has been performed to investigate the efficacy of cefpirome in the treatment of bacterial meningitis. cefepime was as effective and safe as cefotaxime for treatment of patients with bacterial meningitis as shown in the only clinical trial.

AB  == plasma fibronectic (pfn) is a high molecular weight multifunction glycoprotein, which augments neutrophil and macrofage phagocytosis and acts as a nonspecific opsonin for the reticuloendothelial system. in this study we have determined pfn  concentrations in fifty eight preterm infants to discriminate infected from non infected ones. concentrations of pfn decreased from baselin in babies with early  or late onset infections. the changes in pfn concentrations were not found before sepsis, but on day 1. by day 5 pfn concentrations have increased and have been no longer different from controls. we have calculated sensitivity (73.68%), specificity (74.36%), positive (58.35%) and negative (85.29%) predictive values of pfn and of other markers of infections (c-reactive protein--crp-, immature/mature neutrophil ratio--i/m n. ratio-). adding these tests to pfn, provided equal specificity and positive predictive value, but increased sensitivity (94.73%) and negative predictive value (96.43%). thus, low concentrations of pfn may be a valuable but not early marker for neonatal infections. the combination of pfn, crp and i/m n. ratio increase the precision of diagnostic testing.

TI  == a 4-year study of neonatal meningitis: clinical and microbiological findings.
AB  == the clinical and microbiological data of 60 neonates, 23 from the neonatal unit (group i) and 37 (group ii) from the general paediatric wards with meningitis are presented. the overall prevalence/1000 was significantly lower in group i (0.36)  than in group ii (1.11; p < 0.0001). this low incidence follows the introduction  of amikacin for the treatment of the ill neonate in 1986. streptococcus agalactiae 21 (35 per cent), klebsiella pneumoniae 17 (28 per cent) and e. coli 10 (17 per cent) were the commonest pathogens accounting for 80 per cent of the cases. streptococcus agalactiae isolates were uniformly susceptible to penicillin and chloramphenicol. gram negative isolates showed resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol and sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim. in addition k. pneumoniae isolates showed resistance to gentamycin and amikacin. all isolates were fully susceptible to cefotaxime. recently, four of six cases of k. pneumoniae in the neonatal unit were resistant to amikacin. low birth weight, additional clinical problems, and ultrasound changes on cranial scanning carried a poor prognosis. emphasis should be placed on close collaboration between clinicians and microbiologists in the choice of antimicrobial agents and aseptic techniques for  the care of neonates.

TI  == comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: a multi-center study in five mediterranean countries.
AB  == in 5 mediterranean countries 7902 pathogens, all isolated in 1992 and 1993 from community-acquired infections, were studied for susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin g, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid (both 2:1 ratio), cefalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime,  cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. ten centers in italy, 4 centers in greece, 3 centers in spain, and 1 center in lebanon and saudi arabia contributed  to this study; all centers used performed standardized microtiter panels (sceptor, bbl, heidelberg, frg). the most frequently isolated pathogens were escherichia coli (n = 1267), proteus mirabilis (n = 843), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 771), enteric salmonella spp. (n = 629), enterobacter cloacae (n = 486), citrobacter freundii (n = 383), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 346), haemophilus influenzae (n = 298), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 294), streptococcus pneumoniae  (n = 246), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 243), and shigella spp. (n = 185). statistical analysis was performed for each of the above countries and for all pooled data available. the penicillin antibiotics were the most active compounds against the  gram-positive cocci, exceeding the mic90 values 2- to 8-fold over all cephalosporins. regarding the gram-negatives (above all klebsiella spp.) cefetamet was by far the most active compound (mic90 = 1 mg/l). regarding the percentage of resistant isolates, there were no striking discrepancies between the centers and countries involved in this study. there was, however, complete cross-resistance in penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae isolates (mic90 = 2 mg/l). by far the majority of the penicillin-resistant pneumococci showed additional resistance to doxycycline and erythromycin.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == the aim of our study was to re-evaluate the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics against bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. the study drugs were cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cefixime, cefuroxime, cefetamet, cefprozil, and the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (= augmentin). in addition, cefotaxime as the standard agent  of parenteral third generation cephalosporins was examined. the organisms tested  were staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococci of serogroups c and g, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis. minimal inhibitory concentrations of  the antimicrobials were determined with the agar dilution procedure. cefpodoxime  showed the broadest spectrum and generally also the highest activity of the oral  beta-lactam antibiotics examined. the drug was equally active against the major groups of beta-lactamase negative and positive bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, all beta-lactam agents exhibited reduced activity comparable to the reduced activity of penicillin.

TI  == antibacterial activity of cefepime in vitro.
AB  == cefepime is a new parenterally active fourth-generation cephalosporin which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. using the standard agar dilution method we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin against clinical isolates of escherichia coli (98 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (99 strains), acinetobacter spp. (24 strains), pseudomonas  aeruginosa (98 strains), haemophilus influenzae (108 strains), staphylococcus aureus (100 strains), enterococcus spp. (45 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (10 strains), streptococcus pyogenes (group a; 19 strains) and streptococcus agalactiae (group b; 36 strains). cefepime showed excellent activity against e. coli and k. pneumoniae, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 0.12 mg/l. the in vitro activity of cefepime was superior to or comparable to the third-generation  cephalosporins tested but was inferior to ciprofloxacin against acinetobacter spp. and p. aeruginosa. against h. influenzae, whether or not the strains produced beta-lactamase, its activity was similar to comparable drugs. all 84 isolates of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime whereas, like other cephalosporins, it had little activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. of the 45 enterococci isolates tested, 44.4% were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime. against streptococci, its activity was superior to any drug tested. this in vitro study indicates that cefepime has the  potential to be a valuable agent for the treatment of community- and hospital-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.

TI  == adverse perinatal outcome and resistant enterobacteriaceae after antibiotic usage for premature rupture of the membranes and group b streptococcus carriage.
AB  == objective: to report a case series of adverse perinatal outcomes associated with  resistant enterobacteriaceae after antibiotic usage for premature rupture of the  membranes (prom) and group b streptococcus. methods: maternal and neonatal records were reviewed of four cases in which adverse perinatal outcomes occurred  from resistant enterobacteriaceae after antibiotic usage for either prom or positive group b streptococcal cultures. information on clinical setting, antibiotic usage, maternal and neonatal complications, and maternal and neonatal  cultures was noted. results: all four cases were complicated by prom at 25-35 weeks' gestation. ampicillin or amoxicillin was used in several clinical settings, including therapeutically for the presence of group b streptococcus, presumptively for prom, and prophylactically pending the results of group b streptococcal cultures. clinical chorioamnionitis subsequently developed in all four cases, and in two cases the maternal course was prolonged and complicated by persistent fever and the need for therapy for pelvic vein thrombophlebitis. two neonates died from fulminant clinical sepsis. a third infant, one of a twin gestation, was stillborn, presumably because of sepsis. in three cases, neonatal  and placental cultures revealed escherichia coli resistant to ampicillin; in the  fourth case, klebsiella pneumoniae was identified, with only intermediate sensitivity to ampicillin. conclusion: resistant enterobacteriaceae associated with adverse perinatal outcomes may result from the use of antibiotics, such as ampicillin or amoxicillin, after prom. in deciding whether antibiotic therapy for prom or group b streptococcal prophylaxis is appropriate, the value of purported  benefits must be weighed against presumably infrequent but serious outcomes, including neonatal sepsis and death due to selection or overgrowth of resistant organisms.

TI  == neonatal sepsis and meningitis in mallorca, spain, 1977-1991.
AB  == in a retrospective study at son dureta hospital (palma de mallorca, mallorca, spain) of the period 1977-1991, 334 cases of culture-proven sepsis and/or meningitis in neonates born at the facility were identified. overall, there was an incidence rate of 4.9 cases per 1,000 live births. the case-fatality rate was  7.5%. infection was more frequent in infants of low birth weight, with the exception of infants with meningitis and infections due to group b streptococcus  and listeria species. the patterns of predominance among bacterial pathogens that were isolated changed during the period studied. from 1977 to 1984, klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequent such isolate, but this frequency declined in the following years. group b streptococcus organisms and staphylococcus epidermidis replaced k. pneumoniae as the predominant pathogens in early- and staphylococcus  epidermidis replaced k. pneumoniae as the predominant pathogens in early- and late-onset infections, respectively. the frequency with which other pathogens were isolated did not vary significantly during the study period. invasive infection caused by candida organisms was found in two patients. the incidence of infection due to group b streptococci has increased in the last few years (to 2.4 cases per 1,000 live births in 1991) and has become a significant problem that requires a thorough epidemiological evaluation.

AB  == seven clones of murine monoclonal antibodies specific for group-a streptococci were generated. all of them were of igm isotypes and recognized trypsinized as well as nontrypsinized group-a streptococci and polysaccharide. these were devoid of reactivity with streptococci-b, -c, -g and staphylococcus aureus. polyclonal antibodies against group-a polysaccharide (aps) were also raised in rabbits by linking aps to bovine serum albumin, and rendered monospecific by adsorption. latex agglutination assays were developed employing both types of antibodies. the assay employing monospecific polyvalent antibodies had a sensitivity of 12.5 ng aps/ml as compared to 1 microgram aps/ml for latex sensitized with monoclonal antibodies. both assays were specific, as no agglutination was observed with polysaccharides obtained from streptococci-b, -c, -g, staph. aureus, cornybacterium diptheriae, candida albicans, candida spp., morexella catarrhalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, strep. pneumoniae. salmonella typhi and s. paratyphi a and b. throat  swabs from children obtained in duplicate, when tested for the presence of streptococci-a, showed a good correlation of the results obtained by latex agglutination assay with the microbial culture test and serogrouping.

TI  == purification, composition, and activity of two bactenecins, antibacterial peptides of bovine neutrophils.
AB  == extracts of granules of bovine neutrophils are known to exhibit a marked antibacterial activity in vitro. by a simple, two-step chromatographic procedure, we have resolved two peptide components of the antibacterial system. they were named bac-5 and bac-7 from the general term bactenecin and had molecular masses of about 5 and 7 kilodaltons, respectively. over 45 and 20% of the amino acid residues in the two bactenecins are proline and arginine, respectively. the remaining amino acids are mainly hydrophobic (isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine). both bac-5 and bac-7 efficiently kill escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, and klebsiella pneumoniae. they also arrest the growth of enterobacter cloacae (mics, 25 to 200 micrograms/ml) but not of proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae (mic, greater than 200 micrograms/ml). finally, bac-7 but not bac-5 has mics of less than or equal to 200 micrograms/ml for pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis. from the comparison between the efficient bactericidal concentrations in vitro and the estimated content of bactenecins in neutrophils (125 ng of bac-5 and bac-7 each per 10(6) cells), it is reasonable to conclude that the two cationic peptides may exert a major role in host defense against at least some microorganisms.

TI  == mechanisms of bacterial opsonization by immune globulin intravenous: correlation  of complement consumption with opsonic activity and protective efficacy.
AB  == to study the mechanism of bacterial opsonization by immune globulin intravenous (igiv) complement consumption and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (pmnl) membrane receptor (fcrlo, cr1, and cr3)-mediated phagocytosis of staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and groups a and b streptococci were examined. igiv alone did not consume complement and showed no opsonic activity by itself for these organisms. when these bacteria were preopsonized in igiv, significant amounts of complement were consumed (44%-94%) and the uptake and killing of bacteria occurred. the in vitro opsonic activity of igiv for these organisms was significantly correlated with the amount of complement consumed by  the igiv-opsonized bacteria (r = .85, p less than .05). the in vivo protective efficacy of igiv also appeared to be directly associated with its ability to activate and consume complement (r = 1.0, p less than .001). antibodies to fcrlo  (leu 11) markedly inhibited phagocytosis of bacteria opsonized in igiv but not that of bacteria opsonized in specific igm. both cr1 and cr3 receptors on pmnls were involved in uptake, but the contribution of each is different with different organisms.

TI  == group b streptococci inhibit the chemotactic activity of the fifth component of complement.
AB  == infection with group b streptococci (gbs) is associated with a poor acute inflammatory response in which neutrophils fail to localize at the site of invasion. in the present studies, we have examined the effects of group b streptococci on c-derived chemotactic activity in human serum. fresh human serum  was activated to form c5a and c5adesarg by incubation with zymosan. the activated serum was then incubated with group b organisms, centrifuged, and the supernatants tested for chemotactic activity for human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. group b organisms caused a dose-dependent decrease in c-dependent chemotactic activity. the degree of inhibition was profound with 1 x 10(9) bacteria/ml (10% of control). experiments indicated that significant chemotactic  factor inactivation occurred within 2 min of exposure to gbs organisms, while maximal inhibition occurred after 30 min incubation. a number of different strains of gbs of types i, ii, and iii possessed inhibitory activity. in contrast, group d streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae failed to inhibit the c-derived chemotactic activity in human serum. group a streptococci that were m protein positive also inactivated c-dependent chemotactic activity in serum, as previously reported. the inhibitory activity of the gbs strains could be abolished by heat or trypsin treatment but not by neuraminidase, pronase, or pepsin. c5a levels in zymosan-activated serum as measured by ria were not decreased after incubation with an inhibitory strain  suggesting that absorption was not involved. sds-page analysis revealed that group b streptococci degrade the c5a molecule, increasing its electrophoretic mobility by removing a fragment with a m.w. of approximately 650 da. thus, one of the reasons for the poor inflammatory response at the site of gbs infection may reside in the ability of these pathogens to inactivate c-derived inflammatory mediators. the gbs c5a-ase activity probably serves as an additional virulence factor for these organisms contributing to the poor inflammatory response characteristic of group b streptococcal infection.

AB  == a blend of nylon fiber and silver-coated nylon fiber (the latter known as x-static) was used in these experiments. this fiber was bactericidal when bacteria were exposed to it directly or to an extract derived from its prior incubation in salt solution. at ambient temperatures, a rapid exponential decrease of survival occurred, usually after a delay of approximately 1 h. the rate of killing (decrease of survival) increased with an increase in x-static percentage of the fiber blend, temperature of fiber extraction, concentration of  tris buffer present during extraction, and temperature at which bacteria were exposed to the extract. when bacteria were exposed to the extract at 37 degrees c as opposed to ambient temperature, there was no delay in onset of killing. escherichia coli was generally the indicator organism tested, but comparable results were also found for pseudomonas, klebsiella, staphylococcus, and streptococcus species. the rate of killing increased with increasing silver ion concentration of the fiber extract, as determined through atomic absorption spectrophotometry. the rate of killing was greater and the onset was earlier with an extract containing silver ions from fiber than with a salt solution containing the same concentration of silver ions from silver nitrate. studies of the kinetics of ion release suggested that x-static may be an effective, sustained-release antibacterial agent.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of cephem antibiotics against isolates from clinical specimens at the yokohama city university hospital].
AB  == minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cephem antibiotics against 405 strains belonging to 17 species of clinical isolates were investigated using the  standard method of the japanese congress of chemotherapy. the results obtained are summarized below. cephem antibiotics showed weak antibacterial activities against enterococcus sp., b. fragilis and s. marcescens. s. pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis were susceptible to cephem antibiotics. cephem antibiotics of the 1st and the 2nd generations showed weak antibacterial activity against citrobacter sp. and e. cloacae, while cephem antibiotics of 3rd generation had a good antibacterial activity against these species. cephem antibiotics of the 2nd and the 3rd generations showed high antibacterial activity against h. influenzae and indole positive proteus group. cefoperazone showed high antibacterial activity against p. aeruginosa. resistance to latamoxef, ceftizoxime and cefoxitin was observed among staphylococcus sp., while the mics of other antibiotics against staphylococcus sp. were fairly low. number of strains resistant to the 3rd cephem antibiotics seems to be increasing  because the 3rd generation of cephem antibiotics have been used frequently. further investigation will be required on resistant organism to these antibiotics including beta-lactamase producing strains.

TI  == in-vitro activity of newer quinolones against aerobic bacteria.
AB  == nalidixic and five newer 4-quinolones, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin were tested against 576 recent clinical aerobic bacterial isolates. the 4-quinolones were regularly active (mic90 less than 4 mg/l) against the following bacteria: staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. saprophyticus, different enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, agrobacter spp., aeromonas spp., plesiomonas spp., neisseria meningitidis. other bacteria were usually intermediately susceptible or resistant: different streptococci, listeria monocytogenes, nocardia asteroides, p. maltophilia, achromobacter xylosoxydans and alcaligenes denitrificans. ciprofloxacin was the most potent compound, followed by ofloxacin and pefloxacin, norfloxacin and enoxacin being less active. all the 4-quinolones were much more active than nalidixic acid. the mbc/mic ratios of the 4-quinolones were between 1 and 2 with a majority of strains, and between 2 and 3 with streptococcus agalactiae, str. faecalis and l. monocytogenes. a two- to eight-fold increase of mic was observed by increasing the inoculum 10,000-fold with most of the strains tested. susceptible bacterial population of klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa contained more clones resistant to nalidixic acid (10(4) to 10(8) at four times the mic) than to 4-quinolones (10(5) to 10(9) at four times the mic). supplementing the media with mgso4 produced smaller inhibition zone diameters with a disc diffusion method than those obtained with non-supplemented  agar, with all quinolone or strains. less regular effect, or no effect was obtained after supplementation with znso4 or ca(no3)2.

TI  == [evaluation of bacterial growth rate by the atp-bioluminescence method (luciferase assay)--comparison with conventional methods and application to clinical studies].
AB  == bacterial growth rate was evaluated by estimating the increase in atp content of  cultures of bacterial suspensions using luciferase assay, and the method was applied to the estimation of bactericidal activity of serum and anti-bacterial activity of antibiotics. the results obtained were as follows: the bacterial numbers or bacterial growth rate determined by the atp-bioluminescence method was in accordance with those by cfu assay and spectrometrical assay by optical density readings. furthermore this method was confirmed to be non-time-consuming  and more simple than other methods. using this method, anti-bacterial activity of fresh serum was evaluated. the serum suppressed the growth rate of e. coli, str.  fecalis, cbs, kleb. pneumoniae and staph. aureus at least for 2 hours. heat-inactivated serum and absorbed serum with bacteria tended to lose such suppressive effect. thus the main effective factors seem to be complements and specific antibody. the anti-microbial activity of antibiotics was enhanced by addition of fresh serum to bacterial cultures, and the results were not in accordance with those by the conventional disc method. thus the sensitivity test  under the influence of fresh serum is recommended in order to know the clinical effect of antibiotics. these results suggest the usefulness of atp-bioluminescence method in the clinical laboratory examinations or investigations.

TI  == immediate postmortem cultures in an intensive care nursery.
AB  == the results of several published studies suggest that bacterial infection plays an important role in the mortality of neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) patients. to evaluate more thoroughly this role we have routinely performed postmortem cultures of blood and cerebrospinal fluid on all infants who die in our nicu. during a 5-year review period 25.9% of infants who died had one or both cultures positive for an organism considered to be pathogenic in the neonate. the organisms most commonly cultured were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli and group b streptococcus. of those infants who had positive postmortem cultures and  who had an autopsy, 95% had histologic evidence of infection. forty-three percent of our infants with positive postmortem cultures were not suspected of having a serious infection and had not received antibiotics before death. postmortem cultures appeared to be helpful in identifying nicu patients in whom serious infection may have played a role in mortality. unsuspected serious infection is a common finding in infants who die in a neonatal intensive care setting.

AB  == the pharmacokinetics of sulfadiazine (sd) combined in a small dose (250 mg) with  trimethoprim (tmp, 160 mg) and given twice daily were studied in eight healthy subjects. both drugs were rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and their concentrations in serum as well as in urine could be considered high enough for the treatment of acute urinary tract infections (uti). in none of the subjects did the concentration of sd in urine exceed the experimental limit established for crystallization of the drug. serum half-lives of sd and tmp were  10.8 and 11.8 hrs, respectively. in microbiological assay synergistic interaction was found in human urine with both the combination of sd + tmp and sm (sulfamethoxazole) + tmp on all the tested strains of e. coli, str. faecalis, str. agalactiae, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. a double-blind clinical trial was carried out with patients having acute uti, using either the combination sd + tmp (250 mg + 160 mg) or the combination sm + tmp (800 mg + 160  mg) twice daily for one week. the results of the treatment were equally successful in both groups. treatment failed in only 4 out of 85 cases, although in 12 cases the causative micro-organism was resistant in vitro to the combination of sm + tmp.

TI  == mastitis: ii. evaluation of antimicrobial amines for use as teat dips.
AB  == recent proposals by the food and drug administration to regulate teat dips as drugs have led to a search for safer teat dip ingredients. primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl amines (carbon-10 to -18 chain length) inhibit growth of mastitic bacteria (streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichi coli, klebsiella pneumoniae) in a broth tube culture assay. since carbon-13 compounds were active, a carbon-13 primary (tridecanamine hydrochloride), secondary methyl (n-methyltridecanamine), secondary ethyl (n-ethyltridecanamine), tertiary dimethyl amine (n, n-dimethyltridecanamine), and carbon-12 quaternary amine (n, n, -trimethyldodecaneammonium chloride) were tested for their ability to reduce experimentally applied populations of s. agalactiae or e. coli on the bovine teat surface. the five compounds were compared at concentrations of 100, 500, 1,000, 3,000, 7,000, and 10,000 ppm. activity was greater against the gram-positive s. agalactiae than against the gram-negative e. coli. the tertiary amine was most active, producing a log reduction of 4 (reduction of bacterial number from 10(6) to 10(2)) at a concentration of 3,000 ppm in the teat dip. the relative order of effectiveness for the amines was: dimethyl tertiary greater than methyl secondary greater than  ethyl secondary greater than primary = quaternary. the results suggest that these amines may be useful as potent, effective antibacterial agents for incorporation  into teat dips.

TI  == [clinical differentiation between idiopathic respiratory distress, neonatal septicemia caused by group b streptococci and septicemia caused by other pathogens (author's transl)].
AB  == since bacterial infection in newborns must be treated as specifically and as early as possible, it is important to confirm a diagnosis of suspected infection  based on clinical symptoms and to take possible pathogens into consideration when choosing therapy. rds and septicemia with group b streptococci can present very similar clinical symptoms, but leucopenia on the first day of life is most probably an indication of septicemia with group b streptococci. septicemia caused by other pathogens, however, usually has a much later onset. in the days following birth a raised cardiothoracic index indicates rds. other differential criteria are being investigated.

TI  == defective activation of the third component of complement in the sera of newborn  infants.
AB  == the activation of the terminal complement components, c3--9, plays an important role in the host's defense against infection. in the present study, the ability of bacteria to activate the third component of complement (c3) in newborn serum was examined. a variety of bacteria were incubated in test sera at 37 degrees c for 30 min and the percent of available c3 that was activated was measured. using one strain of escherchia coli (no. 3), 32% (mean) of the available c3 was activated in sera from 18 newborns, as compared to 85% in sera from their mothers and 79% in sera from 13 normal adults (p less than 0.005). in contrast, using another strain of e. coli (n70), the percent of c3 activated in newborn sera (83%) was the same as in sera from their mothers (81%) or in sera from normal adults (73%). the defective activation of c3 in newborn sera by e. coli was not related to the presence of the k1 antigen. newborn sera were also challenged with other bacterial species and the activation of c3 was deficient when tested with klebsiellae, but not with staphylococci or streptococci. the defect in newborn sera appeared to be due to a deficiency of a serum factor rather than to the presence of an inhibitor.

TI  == neonatal lung abscess. a report of six cases.
AB  == six infants 8 weeks of age or younger had lung abscesses treated in our medical center during the 20-year period of from 1957 to 1977. the duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis, the etiologic organisms, and the therapeutic approach differ  from those in older children and adults. the pathogenic organisms were escherichia coli, group b streptococcus, and klebsiella pneumoniae, initial therapy with a penicillin and an aminoglycoside are indicated until identification and susceptibility results are available on the organism isolated  from the abscess cavity. previously undiagnosed cystic malformations of the lung  were seen in two of the six patients. surgical intervention is usually required in this age group.

TI  == detection of experimental bacteremia and fungemia by examination of buffy coat prepared by a micromethod.
AB  == rabbits received intravenous injections of bacteria or fungi, and a comparison was made of the abilities of broth cultures, plating after dilution either in saline solution or in distilled water containing triton x-100, and buffy coat examinations to detect the organisms in heart blood. the most sensitive method was broth culture. by microscopy or subculture of buffy coat cells prepared by centrifugation of blood in microhematocrit tubes, organisms were rapidly and regularly detected when their viable counts increased to 300--1,000/ml as detected by plating. by micromodification, buffy coat examination is technically  easy to perform, and the method is only slightly less sensitive than when a larger amount of blood is used. thus, it would be ideal for rapid provisional diagnosis of sepsis in patients, e.g., neonates, when the use of only a small blood sample is preferred.

TI  == mastitis: i. in vitro antimicrobial activity of alkyl amines against mastitic bacteria.
AB  == the activities of branched and straight chain amines (10 to 18 carbons chain length) were compared in inhibiting the growth of five microorganisms that cause  about 95% of bovine mastitis. three gram-positive (streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, staphylococcus aureus) and two gram-negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria were used in a trypticase soy broth tube culture growth assay. sixty-two compounds were screened at concentrations of 200, 100, 50, 25, 10, 5, and 1 ppm in broth culture to determine the effective minimum inhibitory concentration. alkyl secondary n-substituted monoethyl [ch3(ch2)nnhch2ch3] and tertiary n,n-substituted dimethyl [ch3(ch2) nn(ch3)2] amines with chain lengths of 11 to 14 carbon atoms were active against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. antimicrobial activity against gram-positive organisms increased with increasing chain length and carbon-14 to 18 amines were active at 1 to 5 ppm. the carbon-11 to 13 alkyl amines were most active against gram-positive organisms; longer chain amines (more than 14 carbons) were inactive. branching of the alkyl chain caused a loss of activity against gram-negative but not against gram-positive bacteria. antimicrobial testing of monoamines, polyamines, and the influence of order substituents were investigated to correlate structure-acitivity relationships.

TI  == ticarcillin: a collaborative in vitro comparison with carbenicillin against over  9,000 clinical bacterial isolates.
AB  == the minimal inhibitory concentrations of ticarcillin and carbenicillin were determined for 9,236 clinical bacterial isolates by the broth microdilution method at four participating laboratories. ticarcillin showed significantly increased activity against klebsiella pneumoniae (p less than .001), pseudomonas  aeruginosa (p less than .001) and aeromonas hydrophilia (p less than .005) when compared to carbenicillin, but no signifcant differences were observed against other gram-negative organisms. ticarcillin was consistently less active against the gram-positive cocci, and these differences were significant for staphylococcus aureus (p less than .001), streptococcus agalactiae (p less than .001), staphylococcus epidermidis (p less than .001) and streptococcus viridans (p less than .005). significant regional and institutional differences in susceptibility to the two drugs were observed for several species, including common nosocomial pathogens such as s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae and escherichia coli.

TI  == intramammary infections in a dairy herd with a low incidence of streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == in a dairy herd with a low incidence of intrammary infections due to streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus, clinical mastitis remained a  serious problem despite good control of nonclinical mastitis through postmilking  teat disinfection and antibiotic therapy of known infected quarters at the end of lactation. during the 2-year study, the incidence of clinical mastitis was 0.88 cases/cow-year; 32.2% were caused by streptococcal species other than str agalactiae and 33.5% by gram-negative organisms. among all new infections detected, 54.1% were caused by streptococcal species other than str agalactiae and 25.7% by gram-negative bacteria. among new infections, 41.6% occurred during  the nonlactating period or within a few days of calving. incidence of clinical mastitis was highest in the 1st month of lactation. among 84 gram-negative infections, 42.8% were caused by klebsiella pneumoniae, 20.2% by escherichia coli, and 23.8% by enterobacter spp. among the many serotypes of k pneumoniae and e coli, none was predominant.

TI  == [infective situation in a cow barn contaminated with klebsiella mastitis].
AB  == the infection situation in a four-row cow-house for 153 animals with a frequent occurrence of klebsiella mastitis was subject to a detailed analysis. the following results were obtained after two collections of blood and udder-quarter  milk samples examined by the test-tube agglutination, gel precipitation, and bacteriological diagnosis methods: 1. streptococcus agalactiae was isolated from  milk samples 28 and 31 times, pseudomonas aeruginosa 15 and 19 times, staphylococcus arueus 16 and 19 times, klebsiella pneumoniae 6 and 6 times, acinetobacter calcoaceticus once and 4 times, enterobacter aerogenes twice and three times, and escherichia coli twice. the authors failed to determine the causative agent in 26--38 cows (20--30%) with a pathologically changed secretion. 2. double test-tube agglutination performed in a 30-day interval revealed suspected klebsiella antibodies having a titre of 80 + + and higher in 13 dairy cows (12%); however, the suspicion was disproved by the negative results of gel precipitation. 3. the final deduction concerning the exogenic character of klebsiella mastitis should encourage efforts for good housing, due nutrition, efficacious disinfection, and hygienic milk production.

TI  == acute severe mastitis in cows of the dutch-friesian breed (author's transl).
AB  == one hundred cases of severe acute mastitis are reported. bacteriological examination of the milk was negative in 23% of the cases. e. coli was most frequently found to be the causative organism (23%), followed by st. aureus (19%), c. pyogenes (10%), str. dysgalactiae (9%), str. agalactiae (5%) and a number of other pathogenic agents such as atypical streptococci, str. uberis, haemolytic streptococci, aerobacter aerogenes, kl. pneumoniae, a clostridium and  p. multocida. in several cases, a tentative diagnosis may be based on the clinical symptoms, which is then found to be correct on bacteriological examination of the milk. the prognosis will vary with the causative organism. treatment was life-saving in more than 90% of the cases, the milk-producing capacity of the affected quarter being completely preserved in 36% and partly preserved in 27% of the cases.
