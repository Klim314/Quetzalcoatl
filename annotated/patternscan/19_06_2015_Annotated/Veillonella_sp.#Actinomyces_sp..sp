TI  == salivary pellicle composition and multispecies biofilm developed on titanium nitrided by cold plasma.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the salivary  pellicle (sp) and multispecies biofilm developed on titanium nitrided by cold plasma. methods: titanium discs were allocated into a control group (ti) and an experimental group (tin - titanium-nitrided by cold plasma). the disc surface topography was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (sem) and atomic force microscopy (afm). the chemical composition of the disc surface was determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps). stimulated, clarified, and  filtered saliva was used to form pellicles on the discs. proteome analysis of the adsorbed sp proteins was performed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (lc-ms). the surface free energy (sfe) was evaluated before and after sp formation. a multispecies biofilm composed of actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, veillonella  dispar, and candida albicans was developed on the sp-coated discs. viable microorganism counts were determined. the biomass and average thickness of biofilms were analyzed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (clsm) with comstat  software. the biofilm organization was visualized by sem. results: the surface topography was similar in both groups. the sfe of the tin group did not differ from that of the ti group (p>0.05), although the adsorption of pellicle proteins  increased the sfe in both pellicle-coated groups (p<0.001). different proteins were identified on the ti and tin surfaces. the amount of biofilm was similar for both groups (p=0.416), but the counts of f. nucleatum and s. oralis were higher in the tin group (p<0.001). similar biofilms were characterized by the comstat data, clsm images, and sem images. conclusion: the titanium nitrided by cold plasma exhibited differences in sp composition and multispecies microbial biofilm population compared to the control titanium surface.

TI  == microbiological diversity of peri-implantitis biofilm by sanger sequencing.
AB  == background and objective: to examine the microbial diversity associated with implants with or without peri-implantitis and to identify differences between the bacterial communities in these clinical conditions. material and methods: twenty  subjects were assigned to a control group consisting of subjects with healthy implants and a test group consisting of subjects with peri-implantitis sites, as  well as a healthy implant site (n = 10/group). in the test group, subgingival biofilm samples were taken from the deepest sites of the diseased implant. in both groups, samples were collected from one site around a healthy implant. dna was extracted and the 16s rrna gene was amplified and sequenced, and the phylotypes were identified by comparison with known 16s rrna sequences. results:  the phylogenetic identity of 1387 16s rrna gene clones was determined. healthy implants demonstrated higher proportions of actinomyces, atopobium, gemella, kingella and rothia and lower levels of campylobacter, desulfobulbus, dialister,  eubacterium, filifactor, mitsukella, porphyromonas and pseudoramibacter (mann-whitney u-test; p < 0.05). fusobacterium nucleatum, dialister invisus, streptococcus sp. human oral taxon (hot) 064, filifactor alocis and mitsuokella sp. hot 131 presented a higher mean proportion, while veillonella dispar, actinomyces meyeri, granulicatella adiacens showed lower mean proportions in the  peri-implantitis sites when compared with healthy implants in both the control and test groups (mann-whitney u-test; p < 0.05). conclusion: marked differences were observed in the composition of the subgingival biofilm between healthy and diseased implants. the biofilm associated with peri-implantitis harbored more pathogenic bacterial species from the orange complex and other "unusual" putative pathogens, such as f. alocis, d. invisus and mitsuokella sp. hot 131.

TI  == activity of garenoxacin against 536 unusual anaerobes including 128 recovered from acute pelvic infections.
AB  == garenoxacin, a des-(f)6-quinolone, was tested using the agar dilution method against 536 anaerobic bacteria, composed of 408 unusual strains from various sources and 128 pelvic isolates. only 33/408 (8%) unusual isolates and 6/128 (4.7%) pelvic isolates had garenoxacin mics >/= 4 mug/ml, and 18 and 3 (4.4% and  2.3% of the respective totals) had mics >/= 8 mug/ml. less susceptible unusual isolates included 7/15 veillonella sp. from various clinical sources, 6/14 fusobacterium varium from predominantly abdominal infections, 5/5 f. russii (cat  bites), and 6/9 actinomyces israelii. overall, garenoxacin showed good activity against the isolates studied and has potential utility in mixed aerobic/anaerobic infections.

TI  == central role of the early colonizer veillonella sp. in establishing multispecies  biofilm communities with initial, middle, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  == human dental biofilm communities comprise several species, which can interact cooperatively or competitively. bacterial interactions influence biofilm formation, metabolic changes, and physiological function of the community. lactic acid, a common metabolite of oral bacteria, was measured in the flow cell effluent of one-, two- and three-species communities growing on saliva as the sole nutritional source. we investigated single-species and multispecies colonization by using known initial, early, middle, and late colonizers of enamel. fluorescent-antibody staining and image analysis were used to quantify the biomass in saliva-fed flow cells. of six species tested, only the initial colonizer actinomyces oris exhibited significant growth. the initial colonizer streptococcus oralis produced lactic acid but showed no significant growth. the early colonizer veillonella sp. utilized lactic acid in two- and three-species biofilm communities. the biovolumes of all two-species biofilms increased when veillonella sp. was present as one of the partners, indicating that this early colonizer promotes mutualistic community development. all three-species combinations exhibited enhanced growth except one, i.e., a. oris, veillonella sp., and the middle colonizer porphyromonas gingivalis, indicating specificity among three-species communities. further specificity was seen when fusobacterium  nucleatum (a middle colonizer), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a late colonizer), and p. gingivalis did not grow with s. oralis in two-species biofilms, but inclusion of veillonella sp. resulted in growth of all three-species combinations. we propose that commensal veillonellae use lactic acid for growth in saliva and that they communicate metabolically with initial, early, middle, and late colonizers to establish multispecies communities on enamel.

TI  == mutualistic biofilm communities develop with porphyromonas gingivalis and initial, early, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is present in dental plaque as early as 4 h after tooth  cleaning, but it is also associated with periodontal disease, a late-developing event in the microbial successions that characterize daily plaque development. we report here that p. gingivalis atcc 33277 is remarkable in its ability to interact with a variety of initial, early, middle, and late colonizers growing solely on saliva. integration of p. gingivalis into multispecies communities was  investigated by using two in vitro biofilm models. in flow cells, bacterial growth was quantified using fluorescently conjugated antibodies against each species, and static biofilm growth on saliva-submerged polystyrene pegs was analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr using species-specific primers. p. gingivalis could not grow as a single species or together with initial colonizer  streptococcus oralis but showed mutualistic growth when paired with two other initial colonizers, streptococcus gordonii and actinomyces oris, as well as with  veillonella sp. (early colonizer), fusobacterium nucleatum (middle colonizer), and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (late colonizer). in three-species flow cells, p. gingivalis grew with veillonella sp. and a. actinomycetemcomitans but not with s. oralis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. also, it grew with veillonella sp. and f. nucleatum but not with s. oralis and f. nucleatum, indicating that p.  gingivalis and s. oralis are not compatible. however, p. gingivalis grew in combination with s. gordonii and s. oralis, demonstrating its ability to overcome the incompatibility when cultured with a second initially colonizing species. collectively, these data help explain the observed presence of p. gingivalis at all stages of dental plaque development.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI  == influence of local tetracycline on the microbiota of alveolar osteitis in rats.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of local tetracycline on the occurrence of alveolar osteitis in rats, and on the microbiota associated to  this infection. forty wistar rats were randomly assigned to 4 groups (n=10): i -  the rats had the maxillary right incisor extracted and the alveolar wound did not receive any treatment; ii - adrenaline and ringer-pras were introduced into the alveolar wound; iii - the alveolar wound was irrigated with sterile saline; and iv - the alveolar wound was irrigated with an aqueous solution of tetracycline. microbial samples from the alveolar wounds were collected 2 days after surgery and inoculated on blood agar (with and without 8 microg/ml of tetracycline) and other selective media, and were incubated in either aerobiosis or anaerobiosis at 37 degrees c, for 2 to 14 days. it was verified that tetracycline reduced the occurrence of alveolar osteitis in the rats and caused significant changes in the microbiota of the surgical sites, decreasing the number of anaerobes and increasing the participation of tetracycline-resistant and multi-resistant microorganisms.

TI  == bacterial profiles of root caries in elderly patients.
AB  == culture-based studies have shown that streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli are associated with root caries (rc). the purpose of the present study was to assess  the bacterial diversity of rc in elderly patients by use of culture-independent molecular techniques and to determine the associations of specific bacterial species or bacterial communities with healthy and carious roots. plaque was collected from root surfaces of 10 control subjects with no rc and from 11 subjects with rc. the bacterial 16s rrna genes from extracted dna were pcr amplified, cloned, and sequenced to determine species identity. from a total of 3,544 clones, 245 predominant species or phylotypes were observed, representing eight bacterial phyla. the majority (54%) of the species detected have not yet been cultivated. species of selenomonas and veillonella were common in all samples. the healthy microbiota included fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, leptotrichia spp., selenomonas noxia, streptococcus cristatus, and kingella oralis. lactobacilli were absent, s. mutans was present in one, and actinomyces spp. were present in 50% of the controls. in contrast, the microbiota of the rc subjects was dominated by actinomyces spp., lactobacilli, s. mutans, enterococcus faecalis, selenomonas sp. clone cs002, atopobium and olsenella spp., prevotella multisaccharivorax, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and propionibacterium sp. strain fma5. the bacterial profiles of rc showed considerable subject-to-subject variation, indicating that the microbial communities are more complex than previously presumed. the data suggest that putative etiological agents of rc include not only s. mutans, lactobacilli, and actinomyces but also species of atopobium, olsenella, pseudoramibacter, propionibacterium, and selenomonas.

TI  == association between the presence of bacterial 16s rna in prostate specimens taken during transurethral resection of prostate and subsequent risk of prostate cancer (sweden).
AB  == objective: to study bacterial 16s rna in archival prostate samples from 352 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (bph) and evaluate whether the presence of bacterial dna was different in those who later developed prostate cancer (n =  171) and in the matched controls that did not progress to cancer (n = 181). methods: 16s dna pcr followed by cloning and sequencing the positive samples. results: in 96/352 (27%) of the prostate tissue specimens 16s rna were detected.  sequence analysis revealed propionibacterium acnes as the predominant microorganism (23% of 16s rna positive patients). the second most frequent isolate-escherichia coli was found in 12 (12%) patients. the other isolates included pseudomonas sp. (3 patients), actinomyces sp. (2), streptococcus mutans  (1), corynebacterium sp. (2), nocardioides sp. (1), rhodococcus sp. (1) veillonella sp. (2). in p. acnes positive samples 62% exhibited severe histological inflammation versus 50% in the bacteria-negative group (p = 0.602).  the presence of p. acnes in the prostate was associated with prostate cancer development (or 2.17, 95% ci 0.77-6.95). conclusions: this study has revealed p.  acnes as the most common bacteria in the prostate in bph. further studies are needed to clarify its role in contributing to the development of prostatic inflammation and prostate cancer.

TI  == molecular characterization of subject-specific oral microflora during initial colonization of enamel.
AB  == the initial microbial colonization of tooth surfaces is a repeatable and selective process, with certain bacterial species predominating in the nascent biofilm. characterization of the initial microflora is the first step in understanding interactions among community members that shape ensuing biofilm development. using molecular methods and a retrievable enamel chip model, we characterized the microbial diversity of early dental biofilms in three subjects. a total of 531 16s rrna gene sequences were analyzed, and 97 distinct phylotypes  were identified. microbial community composition was shown to be statistically different among subjects. in all subjects, however, 4-h and 8-h communities were  dominated by streptococcus spp. belonging to the streptococcus oralis/streptococcus mitis group. other frequently observed genera (comprising at least 5% of clone sequences in at least one of the six clone libraries) were actinomyces, gemella, granulicatella, neisseria, prevotella, rothia, and veillonella. fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) confirmed that the proportion of streptococcus sp. sequences in the clone libraries coincided with the proportion of streptococcus probe-positive organisms on the chip. fish also revealed that, in the undisturbed plaque, not only streptococcus spp. but also the rarer prevotella spp. were usually seen in small multigeneric clusters of cells. this study shows that the initial dental plaque community of each subject  is unique in terms of diversity and composition. repetitive and distinctive community composition within subjects suggests that the spatiotemporal interactions and ecological shifts that accompany biofilm maturation also occur in a subject-dependent manner.

TI  == microarrays complement culture methods for identification of bacteria in endodontic infections.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the microbial composition of necrotic root canals using culture methods and microarray technology. twenty uniradicular  teeth with radiographic evidence of periapical bone loss and with no previous endodontic treatment were selected for this study. for molecular diagnosis a dna  chip with 20 different species-specific, 16s-rdna-directed catcher probes was used. the microorganisms most frequently detected by the dna chip were: micromonas micros, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp., tannerella forsythia, treponema  denticola, veillonella parvula, eubacterium nodatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces odontolyticus, and streptococcus constellatus. as expected, additional important bacterial taxa were found by culture analysis, but microorganisms such as t. forsythia and t. denticola could not be identified. in  conclusion, microarrays may provide significant additional information regarding  the endodontic microbiota by detecting bacterial species that are otherwise difficult or impossible to culture.

TI  == effects of a chlorhexidine gluconate-containing mouthwash on the vitality and antimicrobial susceptibility of in vitro oral bacterial ecosystems.
AB  == oral bacterial microcosms, established using saliva inocula from three individuals, were maintained under a feast-famine regime within constant-depth film fermenters. steady-state communities were exposed four times daily, postfeeding, to a chlorhexidine (chx) gluconate-containing mouthwash (chxm) diluted to 0.06% (wt/vol) antimicrobial content. the microcosms were characterized by heterotrophic plate counts and pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). chxm caused significant decreases in both total anaerobe  and total aerobe/facultative anaerobe counts (p < 0.05), together with lesser decreases in gram-negative anaerobes. the degree of streptococcal and actinomycete inhibition varied considerably among individuals. dgge showed that chxm exposure caused considerable decreases in microbial diversity, including marked reductions in prevotella sp. and selenomonas infelix. pure-culture studies of 10 oral bacteria (eight genera) showed that actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella dispar, prevotella nigrescens, and the streptococci were highly susceptible to chx, while lactobacillus rhamnosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and neisseria subflava were the least susceptible. determination of the mics of triclosan, chx, erythromycin, penicillin v, vancomycin, and metronidazole for microcosm isolates, before and after 5 days of chxm exposure, showed that chxm exposure altered the distribution of isolates toward those that were less susceptible to chx (p < 0.05). changes in susceptibility distributions for the other test agents were not statistically significant. in conclusion, population changes in plaque microcosms following repeated exposure to chxm represented an inhibition of the most susceptible flora with a clonal expansion of less susceptible species.

TI  == ecological effects of triclosan and triclosan monophosphate on defined mixed cultures of oral species grown in continuous culture.
AB  == the effects of triclosan and its phosphorylated derivative, triclosan monophosphate were studied using a continuous culture microcosm model. two conditions were simulated, a caries-like state (ph 5.5 with artificial saliva plus glucose as growth medium) and a periodontal disease-like state (ph 7.5 with  bhi plus yeast extract, haemin and cysteine as growth medium). both cultures were maintained anaerobically at 37 degrees c at a growth rate of 0.1/h. steady-state  chemostats were pulsed with triclosan or triclosan monophosphate (initial concentrations between 20 and 40 mg/l) and changes in the ecological composition  noted after 6 h. the caries-like microcosm steady state was dominated by streptococci, lactobacillus and veillonella sp. with low but detectable levels of neisseria, actinomyces and fusobacterium sp. no significant ecological shifts occurred following pulses of either antimicrobial agent; all species were affected to approximately the same degree. the periodontal disease-like microcosm steady state was dominated by streptococci, fusobacterium, veillonella, actinomyces, prevotella and porphyromonas sp. with low numbers of neisseria and lactobacillus sp. significant ecological shifts were apparent following pulses of triclosan. the streptococci became the dominant group followed by fusobacterium sp. for triclosan monophosphate, the streptococci again became dominant although  lactobacillus and actinomyces were now the main sub-dominant species and gram-negative anaerobes including fusobacterium sp. were markedly inhibited. it is concluded that in the periodontal disease state, both triclosan and triclosan  monophosphate affected the gram-negative anaerobes to a greater extent than the gram-positive groups and that this effect was more marked for triclosan monophosphate.

TI  == the effect of scaling and root planing on the clinical and microbiological parameters of periodontal diseases: 12-month results.
AB  == background/aims: previously, we reported that srp resulted in a decrease in mean  pocket depth and attachment level and reduced prevalence and levels of bacteroidesforsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola at 3 and  6 months post-srp in 57 subjects with adult periodontitis. 32 of the 57 subjects  were monitored at 9 and 12 months. thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the microbial and clinical effects of srp in 32 (mean age 48+/-11) subjects over a 12-month period. method: clinical assessments of plaque, gingival redness, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth and attachment level were made prior to srp and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-therapy. subgingival plaque samples were taken at each visit and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique for the presence and levels of 40 subgingival species. each subject also received maintenance scaling at each of the subsequent monitoring visits. differences in clinical parameters and prevalence and levels of bacterial species were analyzed pre- and post-therapy using the wilcoxon signed ranks test. the quade test for related samples was used for analysis of multiple visits. results: mean pocket depth (mm+/-sem) decreased  from 3.2+/-0.3 at baseline to 2.9+/-0.3 at 12 months (p<0.01). mean attachment level showed significant reduction at 6 months, but did not diminish further. bleeding on probing and plaque were significantly reduced at 12 months (p<0.001,  p<0.05, respectively). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and t. denticola decreased in  prevalence and levels up to the 6-month visit and remained at these lower levels  at 9 and 12 months. significant increases in levels and prevalence were noted at  12 months for actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum ss polymorphum, streptococcus mitis, capnocytophaga sp, and veillonella parvula. conclusions: the data suggest that the maintenance phase of therapy may be essential in consolidating clinical and microbiological improvements achieved as a result of initial therapy.

TI  == [effects of antibiotics and anti-bacterial components of preparations for local treatment of suppurative wounds on pathogens of odonto- genic infections].
AB  == the results of identification and sensitivity assay of 156 strains of pathogens causing odontogenic infections are presented. in the sensitivity assay antibacterial drugs were used. 42.3 percent of the strains were obligate anaerobes belonging to bacteroides, fusobacterium, peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, veillonella and actinomyces. significant differences in the microbial sensitivity to the drugs used for general and local therapy were detected. there was observed high sensitivity of the obligate anaerobes to gramicidin (0.02 micrograms/ml), nitazol (10 micrograms/ml), levomycetin and tetracycline (60 micrograms/ml). antiseptics such as dioxidine and chlorhexidine  used locally showed satisfactory results. the above mentioned drugs and especially levomycetin were also rather active against facultative organisms in associations of pathogens causing odontogenic infections: bacillus coagulans, b.  licheniformis, pseudomonas sp., acinetobacter calcoaceticus, staphylococcus sp. and streptococcus sp.

TI  == oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  == two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (peptostreptococcus (1); eubacterium (9); clostridium (6); veillonella (6); megasphera (1); bacteroides (28); fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (p. anaerobius (1); e. fossor (9); c. villosum (1); b. fragilis (1); b. tectum (2); b. heparinolyticus (2)). three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (lrt) or paraoral (po) bacterial infections. of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. among the obligately anaerobic species, gram-positive cocci including p. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, e. fossor 11% and other gram-positive rods (excluding  clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. the gram-negative rods comprised b. fragilis 5%, b. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented bacteroides 3% and other bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of fusobacterium (7%), and gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by pasteurella spp. 19%, escherichia coli 17%, actinomyces spp. 9%, streptococcus spp. 9%. incidental facultative isolates were enterococcus spp. 2%, enterobacter cloaceae 2%, actinobacillus spp. 2% and gram-negative corroding rods 5%. on the basis of the similarities (as determined by dna hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. e. fossor and b. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and lrt and po diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.

TI  == changes in subgingival microbiota during puberty. a 4-year longitudinal study.
AB  == it was the purpose of the present investigation to monitor the composition of the subgingival microbiota at selected sites in individuals passing through puberty and to correlate observed changes with the development of pubertal maturation. between the ages of 11 and 14 years, pubertal and skeletal maturation was monitored annually in 22 boys and 20 girls. during this time, subgingival microbial samples were taken every 4th to 5th month (10 times in 4 years) mesially of the upper first molars. high values in total bacterial counts were reached after the onset of puberty, followed by a decrease towards the end of the observation period. the frequency of detection of actinomyces odontolyticus and of capnocytophaga sp. increased with time. the frequencies of other selected species, specifically of black pigmenting bacteriodes sp. were not found to increase when tested by linear and quadratic models of time trend. however, a statistically significant rise in the frequency of detecting b. intermedius and b. melaninogenicus was noted in the initial pubertal phase identified by the onset of testicular growth in boys (p = 0.05). a significant relationship also existed between testes growth and increase of a. odontolyticus (p less than 0.01). in girls, a similar increase was obtained for a. odontolyticus when studied in relation to the tanner scores for breast development (p less than 0.01). the changes observed in the subgingival microbiota during puberty may be related to the development of gingivitis, which was demonstrated by a higher tendency for gingival bleeding during the course of the pubertal maturation process.

TI  == relationship of bacteriologic characteristics to semen indices in men attending an infertility clinic.
AB  == bacteria can be isolated from most seminal fluid samples, but the significance of these microorganisms is uncertain because most men lack symptoms associated with  bacterial infection of the reproductive tract. we obtained semen samples from 37  men attending a special infertility clinic and assessed the relationship between  seminal fluid microorganisms and seminal fluid analysis including sperm motility, morphology, and concentration; the numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other white blood cells; and the hamster zona-free oocyte sperm penetration assay. aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 36 of the 37 samples. one hundred eighty-eight isolates (113 aerobes, 74 anaerobes, and one yeast) were recovered, with a mean of 5.2 isolates per semen specimen. the microorganisms recovered from the samples included: coagulase-negative staphylococci (89%), viridans streptococci (65%), diphtheroids (86%), peptostreptococcus sp (62%), bacteroides sp (27%), gardnerella vaginalis (19%), lactobacillus sp (16%), actinomyces sp (16%), enterococcus (11%), and veillonella (11%). other microorganisms including group b streptococcus, hemophilus, escherichia coli, mobiluncus, and clostridium were each recovered from fewer than 10% of the specimens. when the microbiology of seminal fluid specimens with or without polymorphonuclear leukocytes was compared, the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the semen was not associated with the isolation of staphylococci (33 versus 25%), viridans streptococci (33 versus 28%), bacteroides sp (17 versus 37%), or peptostreptococcus (31 versus 33%) (p greater  than .05 for each comparison). the proportion of semen samples yielding bacterial isolates was similar after categorization by normal motility (more than 60%), pyospermia (six or more leukocytes per 100 sperm), sperm concentration, morphology, and a normal sperm penetration assay (11% or more).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the predominant cultivable microbiota of active and inactive lesions of destructive periodontal diseases.
AB  == subgingival plaque samples were taken from active and inactive lesions in 33 subjects exhibiting active destructive periodontal diseases. active diseased sites were those which showed a significant loss of attachment within a 2-month interval as computed by the "tolerance method". the predominant cultivable species from 100 active sites were compared with those found in 150 inactive sites of comparable pocket depth and attachment level loss. among the 33 subjects, w. recta, b. intermedius, f. nucleatum, b. gingivalis and b. forsythus  were elevated more often in active sites; whereas, s. mitis, c. ochracea, s. sanguis ii, v. parvula and an unnamed actinomyces sp. were elevated in inactive sites. the likelihood of a site being active was increased if b. forsythus, b. gingivalis, p. micros, a. actinomycetemcomitans, w. recta, or b. intermedius were detected in that site, and decreased if s. sanguis ii, the actinomyces sp., or c. ochracea were detected.

AB  == nine commonly isolated oral bacterial populations were inoculated into a glucose-limited and a glucose-excess (amino acid-limited) chemostat maintained at a constant ph 7.0 and a mean community generation time of 13.9 h. the bacterial populations were streptococcus mutans atcc 2-27351, strep. sanguis nctc 7865, strep. mitior ef 186, actinomyces viscosus wvu 627, lactobacillus casei ac 413, neisseria sp. a1078, veillonella alkalescens atcc 17745, bacteroides intermedius  t 588 and fusobacterium nucleatum nctc 10593. all nine populations became established in the glucose-limited chemostat although strep. sanguis and neisseria sp. were present only after a second and third inoculation, respectively. in contrast, even following repeated inoculations, strep. mutans, b. intermedius and neisseria sp. could not be maintained under glucose-excess conditions. a more extensive pattern of fermentation products and amino acid catabolism occurred under glucose-limited growth; this simultaneous utilization of mixed substrates also contributed to the higher yields (y molar glucose) and greater species diversity of these communities. microscopic and biochemical evidence suggested that cell-to-cell interactions and food chains were occurring  among community members. to compare the reproductibility of this system, communities were established on three occasions under glucose-limitation and twice under glucose-excess conditions. the bacterial composition of the steady-state communities and their metabolic behaviour were similar when grown under identical conditions but varied in a consistent manner according to the nutrient responsible for limiting growth. although a direct simulation of the oral cavity was not attempted, the results show that the chemostat could be used  as an environmentally-related model to grow complex but reproducible communities  of oral bacteria for long periods from a defined inoculum.

TI  == effect of saccharin on growth and acid production of glucose-grown pathogenic and oral bacteria.
AB  == growth and acid production of glucose-grown gram-positive and gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02  to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. all gram-positive rods, i.e. actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis and corynebacterium diphtheriae, and gram-positive cocci, i.e. streptococcus spp, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. while gram-negative cocci, i.e. veillonella sp and neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. saccharin caused a significant reduction  in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.

TI  == the association between dietary sucrose consumption and microbial population shifts at six oral sites in man.
AB  == sucrose-related microbial population shifts were evaluated at 6 oral sites in 22  volunteers, who consumed high-sucrose diets for 21 days followed by low-sucrose diets for 21 days. culturing was performed at 0, 12, 21, 33 and 42 days of the 6-week experiment. over 50,000 microbial isolates were characterized and analysed. analysis of initial cultures showed the following site-specific microbial characteristics of the 6 sites evaluated: (1) molar fissures harboured  higher levels of neisseria species and showed the highest facultative-to-anaerobic ratio; (2) molar fissures and cervical buccal sites showed high streptococcus sanguis levels and total gram-positive cocci and fewer  gram-negative bacilli; (3) the tongue and saliva gave high concentrations of streptococcus salivarius and veillonella sp. sucrose intake was positively related to concentrations of yeasts and streptococcus mutans in the molar fissures; actinomyces viscosus in the mandibular approximal site; strep. mutans,  veillonella sp. and lactobacillus sp. in the maxillary approximal site and strep. salivarius on the tongue and in saliva. sucrose intake was negatively related to  concentrations of neisseria sp. on the tongue and total gram-positive bacilli in  saliva. a definite ecological effect of sucrose on the oral microflora was confirmed. the high inter-subject and site variations of target bacteria and the  generally low magnitude of shifts, however, discourage implementation of microbiological criteria in dietary assessments.

TI  == normal cultivable microflora in upper jejunal fluid in children without gastrointestinal disorders.
AB  == bacteriological studies of uncontaminated upper jejunal fluid were performed in 51 danish children without gastrointestinal disorders. thirty-seven percent of the samples were sterile [less than 10(1) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml]. in 25%  of the cases, the total number of microorganisms exceeded 10(5) cfu/ml. the microorganisms isolated most frequently were: streptococcus, sp. ("viridans group"), veillonella parvula, hemophilus parainfluenzae, lactobacillus, sp., corynebacterium, sp., actinomyces, sp., bacteroides, sp., and hemophilus influenzae, each found in more than 10% of the children. the upper range for the  number of microorganisms isolated exceeded 10(5) cfu/ml for most of the species isolated of which the vast majority belonged to an "oral type" of flora. enterococci were isolated in small numbers in three children, and enterobacteriaceae were not found.

TI  == human neutrophil migration under agarose to bacteria associated with the development of gingivitis.
AB  == in clinically healthy gingiva and increasingly with the development of inflammation, neutrophils are found in the gingival tissues and sulcus. this study evaluated the relative ability of bacteria associated with gingival health  and developing inflammation to stimulate this increase in neutrophil accumulation. dialyzed bacterial sonic extracts (be) in buffer and pooled human serum (phs) from pure cultures of streptococcus sanguis. actinomyces viscosus, a  naeslundii, bacteroides intermedius, fusobacterium sp and veillonella sp were tested for stimulation of human neutrophil migration under agarose. in addition,  fractions of s sanguis culture fluids (cfs) from sephadex g-10 chromatography were evaluated. all be solutions were incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees c and heat-inactivated prior to testing. all bes in buffer attracted neutrophils, with  the greatest responses seen to s sanguis and b intermedius followed by a viscosus. migration to all bes in phs was greater than in buffer, suggesting that all bes are capable of generating serum chemoattractants. a viscosus be activated serum attractants to the greatest degree. cfs of s sanguis, a viscosus, and to a  lesser degree, fusobacterium sp, also attracted neutrophils. evidence from [3h]fmlp competitive ligand-binding assays indicated that s sanguis cfs contained low molecular weight (less than 700) chemoattractants, which were probably formylmethionyl oligopeptide-like materials. of the bacteria associated with health, s sanguis and a viscosus appeared at least as able to generate chemoattractants during growth or with exposure to serum as bacteria associated with gingivitis. this observation suggests that these "healthy" bacteria, which are found in greater numbers with developing inflammation, may mediate increased  neutrophil transmigration in early disease.

TI  == the normal cultivable microflora in upper jejunal fluid in healthy adults.
AB  == bacteriological studies of uncontaminated upper jejunal fluid were performed in 85 normal subjects. fifty-three per cent of the samples were sterile (less than 10(1) cfu/ml). in 10% of the cases the total number of microorganisms exceeded 10(5) cfu/ml. the main groups of microorganisms isolated were streptococcus sp ('viridans group'), lactobacillus sp., veillonella parvula, actinomyces sp., haemophilus sp., corynebacterium sp., and candida albicans, each found in more than 10% of the subjects. only the streptococcus sp. exceeded 10(5) cfu/ml, and enterobacteria were found in 5% of the subjects, the number not exceeding 10(3) cfu/ml. no other typical members of the lower gastrointestinal tract were isolated. the number of subjects harbouring bacteria and the distribution of bacterial species were the same in both sexes and in different age groups.

TI  == [effect of solid substrates of microbial colony development].
AB  == bacteria have been found to grow differently at contact sites to both organic and anorganic solids as on pure agar media. of 16 ad hoc selected bacterial strains,  the following species (arranged in decreasing order) responded with stronger colony formation: bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, streptococcus sanguis, s. saprophyticus, s. faecalis, escherichia coli, micrococcus flavus, actinomyces viscosus, veillonella sp., enterobacter liquefaciens, yersinia enterocolitica. lactobacillus casei behaved neutral. proteus vulgaris, y. enterocolitica and chromobacterium violaceum grow on certain media only in the presence of solid particles. the yeasts endomyces lactis, saccharomyces cerevisiae, rhodotorula mucilaginosa and cryptococcus nigricans did not respond to solid particles during colony formation. the kind of protein-animal (meat) or vegetable (soy beans)-did  not influence the behaviour of the microorganisms in these experiments.
