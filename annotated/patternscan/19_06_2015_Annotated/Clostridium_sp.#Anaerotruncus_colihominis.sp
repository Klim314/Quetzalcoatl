TI  == anaerotruncus colihominis gen. nov., sp. nov., from human faeces.
AB  == phenotypic and phylogenetic studies were performed on two isolates of an unidentified gram-positive, anaerobic, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium that was isolated from human faeces. the organisms were catalase-negative, produced acetic and butyric acids as end products of metabolism and possessed a dna g+c content of approximately 54 mol%. comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing demonstrated that the two isolates were related closely to each other and formed  a hitherto unknown sublineage within the clostridium leptum rrna cluster of organisms. based on phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence, it is proposed that the unknown bacterium should be classified in a novel genus as anaerotruncus colihominis gen. nov., sp. nov. the type strain of anaerotruncus colihominis is wal 14565(t)=ccug 45055(t)=cip 107754(t).
