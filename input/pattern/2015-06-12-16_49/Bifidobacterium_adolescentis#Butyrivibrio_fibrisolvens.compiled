TI  - Augmentation of vaccenate production and suppression of vaccenate biohydrogenation in cultures of mixed ruminal microbes.
AB  - To increase ruminal outflow of trans-vaccenic acid (t-VA), a new strain of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens (MDT-10) was isolated that has a great ability to hydrogenate linoleic acid (LA) to t-VA. When strain MDT-10 was added to the batch cultures of mixed ruminal microbes (1% of the total number of viable ruminal bacteria), LA conversion to t-VA increased greatly; after 3 h, t-VA levels were > 4-fold higher than the control. By 10 h, all of the t-VA was hydrogenated to stearic acid. However, when a new strain of Bifidobacterium adolescentis (HF-11), which has a high capacity for incorporation of t-VA, was added in conjunction with MDT-10 (1% of the total number of ruminal bacteria), t-VA levels after 10 h were 6 times higher than with MDT-10 alone. These results suggest that t-VA produced by MDT-10 was incorporated into HF-11 cells, resulting in protection of t-VA from t-VA-hydrogenating microbes. Similar results were obtained in a continuous culture of mixed ruminal microbes in which addition of HF-11 simultaneously with MDT-10 increased the amount of t-VA in the effluent 2.5-fold. Both MDT-10 and HF-11 appeared to grow readily in the presence of mixed ruminal microbes. Sixty-two percent of t-VA incorporated by HF-11 was present in the free form, whereas 19, 15, and 3%, respectively, were incorporated into monoacylglycerol, glycerophospholipid, and diacylglycerol fractions. Because these lipids can be digested in the small intestine, it is likely that most t-VA in HF-11 cells is absorbed. Thus, introduction of MDT-10 and HF-11 simultaneously to the rumen might increase the amount of t-VA absorbed and might consequently increase the conversion of t-VA to conjugated linoleic acid in tissue.
