TI  == [ciprofloxacin resistance in gram negative bacilli. epidemiologic aspects].
AB  == background: the aim of the present was to study the resistance to ciprofloxacin (cip) in gram negative bacilli (april 1990-march 1992) and to determine the temporary distribution of the resistant strains by species, samples and departments. methods: seven thousand four hundred seventy-eight samples were studied. the identification and determination of the sensitivity was performed by the pasco (difco) system. haemophilus spp. and campylobacter spp. were excluded from the study. the microorganisms with cim 2 mg/l were considered as resistant (cipr). results: four hundred eighty-one cipr isolations were identified (6.4%).  with regard to the percentage of resistant strains, the species with the highest  were: providencia stuartii (50%); pseudomonas cepacia (44.4%); xanthomonas maltophilia (26.9%); acinetobacter baumannii (25.8%); pseudomonas aeruginosa (16%); citrobacter freundii (12.5%); serratia marcescens (8.4%); enterobacter cloacae (5.8%) and escherichia coli (4.3%). with respect to the absolute number of resistant strains, the most frequent resistant strains were: p. aeruginosa (205), e. coli (144), and a. baumannii (41). isolation of e. coli and a. baumannii cipr increased over the study period. forty-four point five percent of  the e. coli cipr were of extrahospitalary origin; most of the a. baumannii (92.9%) and p. aeruginosa (77.6%) in contrast were of intrahospitalary origin. conclusions: p. aeruginosa, e. coli, and a. baumannii are the most frequently resistant species. the frequency of isolation of resistant strains of e. coli and a. baumannii significantly increased (p < 0.001) over the two years of the study.

TI  == in-vitro activity of meropenem against clinical isolates obtained in canada.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, gentamicin and, where appropriate, other antibiotics against recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. mics were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. meropenem inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp., enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens and providencia stuartii at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l and was four- to 16-fold more active than imipenem against these species. against the enteric pathogens salmonella typhi, shigella sonnei, yersinia enterocolitica and  campylobacter jejuni, meropenem was four- to eight-fold more active than imipenem, inhibiting all isolates at less than or equal to 0.03 mg/l. meropenem was also more active than imipenem against haemophilus influenzae (mic90 0.06 mg/l) but had similar activity against the bacteroides fragilis group (mic90 0.25 mg/l), against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 2 mg/l) and against streptococci. imipenem was four-fold more active than meropenem against acinetobacter spp. and  two- to eight-fold more active against all species of staphylococci tested. both  meropenem and imipenem were inactive against ps. (xanthomonas) maltophilia.

TI  == cloning of ureaplasma urealyticum dna sequences showing genetic homology with urease genes from gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == dna chromosomic sequences from ureaplasma urealyticum were shown, by dna hybridization, to possess homology with providencia stuartii urease genes. the homologous ureaplasma dna fragment was cloned in escherichia coli and a dna probe, designated ic61 probe was specific for only the urease-producing u. urealyticum among the mollicutes. genetic homology shown between the ic61 probe and urease genes from campylobacter pylori, e. coli and p. stuartii suggests that (1) the cloned dna fragment from u. urealyticum contains urease encoding sequences, and that (2) the urease genes possess conserved sequences among phylogenetically distant prokaryotes.

TI  == in-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to enoxacin, norfloxacin, gentamicin and new beta-lactams.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of pefloxacin was compared with that of norfloxacin, enoxacin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and, where appropriate, other beta-lactams against a total of 363 recent clinical isolates.  an agar dilution procedure was used to determine mics and two inocula (10(4) and  10(6) cfu) were used throughout. pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp., enterobacter spp., shigella sonnei, salmonella typhi, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae at less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l. serratia marcescens and providencia stuartii were somewhat more resistant, 2 mg/l of pefloxacin being required to inhibit 90% of isolates of these species. pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa at  4 mg/l and 90% of isolates of the bacteroides fragilis group at 16 mg/l. the activity of enoxacin was similar to that of pefloxacin, with enoxacin being four-fold less active against staph. aureus, two-fold less active against the bacteroides fragilis group and most species of the enterobacteriaceae, and two-fold more active against ps. aeruginosa. pefloxacin showed good activity against gentamicin-resistant ps. aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae and against methicillin-resistant staph. aureus. strains with decreased susceptibility to norfloxacin tended to be less susceptible to both pefloxacin and enoxacin.
