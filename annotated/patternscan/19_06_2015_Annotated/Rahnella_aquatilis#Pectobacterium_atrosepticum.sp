TI  == comparison of specificity and sensitivity of immunochemical and molecular techniques for determination of clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis.
AB  == detection of clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis (cmm), causing bacterial canker of tomato, was verified using pta-elisa and ifas with pabs of neogen europe ltd. (uk), and with published and also laboratory-generated pcr primers from the cmm tomatinase gene. the specificity of this technique was determined with 15 plant-pathogenic and 4 common, saprophytic bacteria. with ifas, crossreactions were found for pantoea dispersa, p. agglomerans and rahnella aquatilis, and with pta-elisa for curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, pectobacterium atrosepticum and dickeya sp. cross-reactions with subspecies other than michiganensis were also found using both methods. molecular methods were optimized by verification of annealing temperatures and times for both primers. conditions were finally adjusted to 30 s at 65 degrees c for dreier's and 10 s at 69 degrees c for our primer set. after this optimization, both primer pairs produced positive reaction only with cmm. by means of pta-elisa and ifas, cmm strains were detected at a concentration up to 10(5) cfu/ml and 10(3) cfu/ml, respectively. the pcr test with bacterial cell suspensions reached a sensitivity  of 10(3) cfu/ml with our designed primers and 104 cfu/ml with dreier's primer pair.
