TI  - Empirical prediction and validation of antibacterial inhibitory effects of various plant essential oils on common pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - In this study, fractional compound composition, antioxidant capacity, and phenolic substance content of 14 plant essential oils-anise (Pimpinella anisum), bay leaves (Laurus nobilis), cinnamon bark (Cinnamomum verum), clove (Eugenia caryophyllata), fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), hop (Humulus lupulus), Istanbul oregano (Origanum vulgare subsp. hirtum), Izmir oregano (Origanum onites), mint (Mentha piperita), myrtus (Myrtus communis), orange peel (Citrus sinensis), sage (Salvia officinalis), thyme (Thymbra spicata), and Turkish oregano (Origanum minutiflorum)--were related to inhibition of 10 bacteria through multiple linear or non-linear (M(N)LR) models-four Gram-positive bacteria of Listeria innocua, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis, and six Gram-negative bacteria of Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella Enteritidis, Salmonella Typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Klebsiella oxytoca. A total of 65 compounds with different antioxidant capacity, phenolic substance content and antibacterial properties were detected with 14 plant essential oils. The best-fit M(N)LR models indicated that relative to anise essential oil, the essential oils of oreganos, cinnamon, and thyme had consistently high inhibitory effects, while orange peel essential oil had consistently a low inhibitory effect. Regression analysis indicated that beta-bisabolene (Turkish and Istanbul oreganos), and terpinolene (thyme) were found to be the most inhibitory compounds regardless of the bacteria type tested.
TI  - Evaluation of drug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in retail poultry and beef.
AB  - There has been increasing concern on the emergence of multidrug-resistant foodborne pathogens from foods of animal origin, including poultry. The current study aimed to evaluate antibiotic-resistant Enterobacteriaceae from raw retail chicken/turkey parts (thigh, wings, breast, and ground) and beef meat (ground and chunks) in Middle Tennessee. Resistance of the collected Enterobacteriaceae to a panel of antibiotics was determined by the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion test. Retail meats were also assayed for the presence of Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli O157:H7. Two hundred thirty-seven samples representing 95.2% of the total of 249 samples tested were positive for Enterobacteriaceae. The level of contamination with Enterobacteriaceae in raw meats ranged from 3.26 log10 cfu/g to 4.94 log10 cfu/g with significant differences in counts among meat types (P < 0.05). Contamination was significantly greater (P < 0.05) in ground beef, beef chucks, ground chicken, chicken breast, and turkey wings (4.92, 4.58, 4.94, 4.75, 4.13 log10 cfu/g, respectively) than ground turkey and chicken wings (3.26 and 3.26 log10 cfu/g, respectively). Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia spp., E. coli, and Haffnia alvei were most prevalent contaminants at 27.4, 14.3, 12.1, and 11.4%, respectively. Resistance of the Enterobacteriaceae to antimicrobials was most frequent with erythromycin, penicillin, and ampicillin at 100, 89, and 65.8%, respectively. Few (2.7%) of the Enterobacteriaceae were resistant to chloramphenicol. Salmonella spp., E. coli O157:H7, Morganella morganii, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Vibrio parahemolyticus exhibited multiple drug resistance. This investigation demonstrates that raw poultry and beef are potential reservoirs of antibiotic-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - N15: the linear phage-plasmid.
AB  - The lambdoid phage N15 of Escherichia coli is very unusual among temperate phages in that its prophage is not integrated into chromosome but is a linear plasmid molecule with covalently closed ends. Upon infection the phage DNA circularises via cohesive ends, then phage-encoded enzyme, protelomerase, cuts at an inverted repeat site and forms hairpin ends (telomeres) of the linear plasmid prophage. Replication of the N15 prophage is initiated at an internally located ori site and proceeds bidirectionally resulting in formation of duplicated telomeres. Then the N15 protelomerase cuts duplicated telomeres generating two linear plasmid molecules with hairpin telomeres. Stable inheritance of the plasmid prophage is ensured by partitioning operon similar to the F factor sop operon. Unlike F sop, the N15 centromere consists of four inverted repeats dispersed in the genome. The multiplicity and dispersion of centromeres are required for efficient partitioning of a linear plasmid. The centromeres are located in N15 genome regions involved in phage replication and control of lysogeny, and binding of partition proteins at these sites regulates these processes. Two N15-related lambdoid Siphoviridae phages, phiKO2 in Klebsiella oxytoca and pY54 in Yersinia enterocolitica, also lysogenize their hosts as linear plasmids, as well as Myoviridae marine phages VP882 and VP58.5 in Vibrio parahaemolyticus and PhiHAP-1 in Halomonas aquamarina. The genomes of all these phages contain similar protelomerase genes, lysogeny modules and replication genes, as well as plasmid-partitioning genes, suggesting that these phages may belong to a group diverged from a common ancestor.
TI  - Occurrence of Listeria and Enterobacteriaceae in domestic refrigerators.
AB  - Consumers' refrigeration practices have a significant impact on the safety and quality of foods. To determine the prevalence and the identity of microorganisms in domestic refrigerators, swab samples were taken from various locations in the refrigerators from 137 households in middle Tennessee. The swabs were inoculated into different media, and standard procedures were used to characterize the isolates. API 20E and API Listeria were used for identification of Enterobacteriaceae and Listeria spp., respectively. The Kirby-Bauer technique was used to test resistance of the isolates. Actual counts for aerobic and Enterobacteriaceae ranged from not detected to 8.53 and 8.39 log CFU per sample, respectively. Klebsiella pneumoniae (23.4%), Klebsiella oxytoca (6.8%), Klebsiella terrigena (4.0%), Enterobacter sakazakii (2.2%), and Yersinia enterocolitica (0.7%) were some of the bacteria of concern that were isolated from domestic refrigerators. Resistance to antibiotics was most common in erythromycin (39.9%), followed by ampicillin (33.8%), cefoxitin (12.8%), tetracycline (5%), streptomycin (4.0%), nalidixic acid (2.1%), kanamycin (1.4%), and colistin (0.7%). None of the isolates tested was resistant to ciprofloxacin or gentamycin. Listeria spp. were also detected in six refrigerators. These findings underline the need for greater consumer education regarding proper refrigerator cleaning and safe food handling practices.
TI  - Interplay between the temperate phages PY54 and N15, linear plasmid prophages with covalently closed ends.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine whether the temperate Yersinia enterocolitica phage PY54 may interact with the related Escherichia coli phage N15 during both the lysogenic and the lytic cycle in the same cell. The PY54 and N15 prophages are linear plasmids which have been shown to be compatible and stably replicating in E. coli and Yersinia. In E. coli, the PY54 prophage does not restrict N15 propagation. In contrast, N15 reduces by use of its cor gene the susceptibility of Yersinia strains to PY54. Doubly lysogenic E. coli strains release PY54 virions, some of which apparently contain the N15 genome. Further experiments with replicative miniplasmid derivatives of PY54, N15, and the related Klebsiella oxytoca phage phiKO2 demonstrated that the phiKO2 and N15 plasmid prophages belong to the same incompatibility group.
TI  - Influence of blood prestorage conditions and white blood cell filtration on the bacterial load of blood deliberately inoculated with Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Currently, the bacterial contamination of blood constitutes one of the major infectious risks of transfusion. The aim of this study was to evaluate the bactericidal effect of blood on various bacterial species and to determine the influence of prestorage conditions and white blood cell (WBC) filtration on the reduction of the bacterial load in isolated red blood cells (RBCs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The growth kinetics of eight different species of bacteria were studied at 20 degrees C in deliberately contaminated RBC units. Further experiments evaluated the effect of prestorage conditions and WBC filtration on the viability of two model bacteria (Klebsiella oxytoca and Staphylococcus epidermidis) in comparison to previous results obtained with Yersinia enterocolitica. RESULTS: For bacteria susceptible to the bactericidal effect of blood (mainly Gram-negative rods), a reduction of the bacterial load was obtained within 2 h of prestorage at 20 degrees C. When the prestorage period was prolonged beyond 3 h at 20 degrees C, rapid growth was observed with some Enterobacteriaceae. Whereas WBC filtration reduced dramatically the viability of Y. enterocolitica, it had only a minimal effect on the viability of S. epidermidis and K. oxytoca. However, the two latter species of bacteria did not survive prolonged storage at 4 degrees C. CONCLUSIONS: Experiments conducted under realistic conditions are needed to determine whether it would be worthwhile recommending the rapid storage of RBCs at 4 degrees C after WBC reduction of the blood product.
TI  - Identification of a chromosome-borne expanded-spectrum class a beta-lactamase from Erwinia persicina.
AB  - From whole-cell DNA of an enterobacterial Erwinia persicina reference strain that displayed a penicillinase-related antibiotic-resistant phenotype, a beta-lactamase gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. It encoded a clavulanic-acid-inhibited Ambler class A beta-lactamase, ERP-1, with a pI value of 8.1 and a relative molecular mass of ca. 28 kDa. ERP-1 shared 45 to 50% amino acid identity with the most closely related enzymes, the chromosomally encoded enzymes from Citrobacter koseri, Kluyvera ascorbata, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus penneri, Rahnella aquatilis, Serratia fonticola, Yersinia enterocolitica, and the plasmid-mediated enzymes CTX-M-8 and CTX-M-9. The substrate profile of the noninducible ERP-1 was similar to that of these beta-lactamases. ERP-1 is the first extended-spectrum beta-lactamase from an enterobacterial species that is plant associated and plant pathogenic.
TI  - Bacterial population of a two-phase anaerobic digestion process treating effluent of cassava starch factory.
AB  - Different groups of microorganisms in a two-phase anaerobic system were enumerated to evaluate the prevalence of specific groups and species. Total and fecal coliforms showed similar values both in acidogenic and methanogenic reactors. The fecal streptococci were 4-fold higher in the acidogenic reactor, when compared with those of the methanogenic reactor. As expected, no methane forming or sulfate reducing bacteria were found in the acidogenic reactor. The populations of methanogenic bacteria were dominated by a mixed population of straight to curved rods and multicellular filaments which strongly resembled members of the genus Methanosaeta. Seven prevalent species of facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were identified as Previdencia alcalifacienciens, Providencia rettgeri, Enterobacter cloaceae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus pennri and Yersinia enterocolitica. The species Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stentophomonas maltophila and Acinotobacter iwoffi, were the most frequently isolated glucose non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli. Among these species, only P. aeruginosa was present in high number in each sample.
TI  - Multiplex PCR for detection of Enterobacteriaceae in blood.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid and sensitive methods are needed to detect the small numbers of bacteria that may sometimes contaminate units of blood during collection. A multiplex 5'-nuclease TaqMan PCR assay (PE Applied Biosystems) was used to detect several bacterial species that may contaminate blood. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Oligonucleotide primers were made for regions of the 16S rRNA gene conserved in four different bacterial species: Yersinia enterocolitica and Serratia, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter species. Two probes were designed: SL-1 detected Serratia, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter species, and YE-3 detected Y. enterocolitica. RESULTS: When TaqMan PCR was performed with chromosomal DNA isolated from pure cultures of Serratia liquefaciens, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Enterobacter agglomerans, the limit of detection with probe SL-1 was 1 to 2 CFUs. For S. marcescens, the sensitivity was 8 CFUs. The limit of detection for Y. enterocolitica with probe YE-3 was 2 CFUs. When total chromosomal DNA was extracted from whole-blood samples spiked with different numbers of Y. enterocolitica, S. liquefaciens, E. cloacae, or K. pneumoniae bacteria, the TaqMan PCR detected 12 to 16 organisms in 1 mL of blood. CONCLUSION: The 5'-nuclease TaqMan PCR assay takes only 3 hours to perform and has the potential to detect very small numbers of bacteria.
TI  - IBC-1, a novel integron-associated class A beta-lactamase with extended-spectrum  properties produced by an Enterobacter cloacae clinical strain.
AB  - A transferable beta-lactamase produced by a multidrug-resistant clinical isolate  of Enterobacter cloacae was studied. The bla gene was carried by a large (>80-kb) transmissible plasmid. Nucleotide sequence analysis of cloned fragments revealed that it was part of a gene cassette carried by a class 1 integron along with other resistance genes, including aac(6')-Ib. The encoded beta-lactamase, designated IBC-1, was a novel class A enzyme that hydrolyzed ceftazidime and cefotaxime and was inhibited by tazobactam and, to a lesser extent, by clavulanate. Also, imipenem exhibited potent inhibitory activity against IBC-1. The enzyme consisted of 287 amino acid residues, including Ser-237, cysteines at positions 69 and 237a, and Arg-244, which may be implicated in its interaction with beta-lactams. In amino acid sequence comparisons, IBC-1 displayed the highest similarity with the chromosomal penicillinase of Yersinia enterocolitica, a carbenicillinase from Proteus mirabilis GN79, the species-specific beta-lactamases of Klebsiella oxytoca, and the carbapenemase Sme-1. However, a phylogenetic association with established beta-lactamase clusters could not be conclusively shown.
TI  - Chromosomal beta-lactamase genes of Klebsiella oxytoca are divided into two main  groups, blaOXY-1 and blaOXY-2.
AB  - The chromosomally encoded beta-lactamase gene (blaOXY-2) of the wild-type Klebsiella oxytoca SL911 was cloned and sequenced. Its nucleotide sequence similarity with the previously sequenced K. oxytoca beta-lactamase gene (blaOXY-1) (Y. Arakawa, M. Ohta, N. Kido, M. Mori, H. Ito, T. Komatsu, Y. Fujii, and N. Kato, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 33:63-70, 1989) is 87.3%, and its amino acid similarity is 89.7%. This group of K. oxytoca beta-lactamases is related to chromosomal beta-lactamases of Citrobacter diversus, Proteus vulgaris, and Yersinia enterocolitica and to the plasmid-mediated extended-spectrum beta-lactamases MEN-1 and Toho-1. By colony hybridization with 86 strains susceptible and resistant to aztreonam, isolated in six countries, K. oxytoca beta-lactamase genes hybridized with either a specific blaOXY-1 DNA probe (668 bp) or a blaOXY-2 DNA probe (723 bp). Thus, beta-lactamase genes could be divided into two groups: blaOXY-1 (47% of the strains) and blaOXY-2 (53% of the strains). A study of isoelectric points confirmed the great variability reported in the literature. However, the two beta-lactamase groups were each represented by four different pIs: for OXY-2, 5.2, 5.7, 6.4, and 6.8, with the 5.2 form representing 59% of all OXY-2 enzymes, and for OXY-1, 7.1, 7.5, 8.2, and 8.8, with the 7.5 form representing 88% of all OXY-1 enzymes.
TI  - A comparative study of the BBL crystal enteric/nonfermenter identification system and the biomerieux API20E and API20NE identification systems after overnight incubation.
AB  - The BBL Crystal Enteric/Nonfermenter (Crystal, Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems) is a new multi-test identification system for Gram negative rods requiring no oil overlay or addition of reagents. One hundred and three selected Gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate API20E or API20NE (BioMerieux) reading after overnight incubation. The isolates included in the study, and the number tested, were as follows: Acinetobacter sp, 8; Aeromonas hydrophila, 1; Citrobacter diversus, 1; Citrobacter freundii, 1; Escherichia coli, 13; Enterobacter aerogenes, 10; Enterobacter agglomerans, 2; Enterobacter cloacae, 6; Klebsiella oxytoca, 6; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; Morganella morganii, 2; Proteus mirabilis, 6; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; Salmonella sp, 2; Salmonella typhi, 1; Serratia marcescens, 1; Shigella sonnei, 2; Shigella sp, 2; Vibrio metschnikovii, 1; Xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, Yersinia enterocolitica, 2. The API20E and API20NE systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the Crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. Twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the API systems compared to 3 with the Crystal. Crystal is more convenient than API for routine clinical use because it requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use.
TI  - Study of Enterobacteriaceae throughout the manufacturing and ripening of hard goats' cheese.
AB  - The evolution of the counts and the species of Enterobacteriaceae as well as some physico-chemical parameters (pH, aw and NaCl and moisture contents) during manufacturing and ripening of a hard Spanish goats' cheese of the Armada-Sobado variety were studied. Enterobacteriaceae (mean log counts 4.45 g-1 in milk) increased 0.71-2.18 log units in curd and afterwards decreased until they disappeared after 2-4 weeks of ripening. This premature disappearance seems to be due to the decrease in aw values and in moisture contents. However, the low pH values, reached from the beginning of the ripening process, could also contribute to this phenomenon. The most abundant species in milk was Serratia liquefaciens (57.5% of isolates), followed by Morganella morganii (27.5%), Hafnia alvei (5%), Klebsiella oxytoca (5%) and Yersinia enterocolitica (5%). Yersinia enterocolitica was not subsequently isolated from either curd or in cheese. Hafnia alvei numbers increased in curd and in 1-week-old cheese where this micro-organism was the most abundant (47.5% and 75% of the isolates respectively). Escherichia coli, which was not isolated from milk, curd or 1-week-old cheese, was the predominant organism in 2-week-old cheese (57.8% of isolates). This confirms the finding of other authors who have shown that it is one of the most resistant species in ripening cheeses.
TI  - Phylogenetic tree and sequence similarity of beta-lactamases.
AB  - beta-Lactamases are the main cause of beta-lactam resistance in many pathogenic bacteria. These enzymes can be detected in a variety of pathogenic as well as non-pathogenic bacteria. The cyanobacteria are also known to produce a beta-lactamase. Recently, the amino acid sequences and the three-dimensional structures of some of these beta-lactamases have been clarified. On the basis of the amino acid sequences of 47 beta-lactamases and the computer-aided analysis, a phylogenetic tree is proposed in this paper. According to the tree, beta-lactamases are classified into six groups. Group 1 beta-lactamases are mainly composed of plasmid-mediated enzymes from gram-negative bacteria. However, chromosome-derived beta-lactamases from Klebsiella pneumoniae and Rhodopseudomonas capsulata take part in this group. Group 2 enzymes consist of a part of the chromosome-encoded beta-lactamases from Streptomyces, and chromosome-mediated enzymes from Yersinia enterocolitica, Citrobacter diversus, and Klebsiella oxytoca. Chromosome-encoded beta-lactamases from gram-negative bacteria form group 3. Group 4 is composed of metalloenzymes, whereas group 5 consists of OXA type beta-lactamases. Chromosome-encoded beta-lactamases from gram-positive bacteria form group 6. Comparison of the amino acid sequences among these groups confirmed the phylogenetic tree and the classification: the beta-lactamases in each group have its particular conserved amino acid sequences. In addition, the tree provides more detailed classification and time-scale mutual relationships and predicts new types of beta-lactamases that may be found. Furthermore, the classification deduced from the tree is generally in accord with the one based on the amino acid sequences reported previously. However, the class A beta-lactamases are clearly divided into three groups: groups 1, 2, and 6. RDF2 analysis shows that some combinations between beta-lactamases and beta-lactam-interacting proteins as well as eukaryotic proteins have a low but significant evolutionary relatedness.
TI  - The Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 61 hrpH product, an envelope protein required for elicitation of the hypersensitive response in plants.
AB  - Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 61 contains a 25-kb cluster of hrp genes that are required for elicitation of the hypersensitive response (HR) in tobacco. TnphoA mutagenesis of cosmid pHIR11, which contains the hrp cluster, revealed two genes encoding exported or inner-membrane-spanning proteins (H.-C. Huang, S. W. Hutcheson, and A. Collmer, Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 4:469-476, 1991). The gene in complementation group X, designated hrpH, was subcloned on a 3.1-kb SalI fragment into pCPP30, a broad-host-range, mobilizable vector. The subclone restored the ability of hrpH mutant P. syringae pv. syringae 61-2089 to elicit the HR in tobacco. DNA sequence analysis of the 3.1-kb SalI fragment revealed a single open reading frame encoding an 81,956-Da preprotein with a typical amino-terminal signal peptide and no likely inner-membrane-spanning hydrophobic regions. hrpH was expressed in the presence of [35S]methionine by using the T7 RNA polymerase-promoter system and vector pT7-3 in Escherichia coli and was shown to encode a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 83,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The HrpH protein in E. coli was located in the membrane fraction and was absent from the periplasm and cytoplasm. The HrpH protein possessed similarity with several outer membrane proteins that are known to be involved in protein or phage secretion, including the Klebsiella oxytoca PulD protein, the Yersinia enterocolitica YscC protein, and the pIV protein of filamentous coliphages. All of these proteins possess a possible secretion motif, GG(X)12VP(L/F)LXXIPXIGXL(F/L), near the carboxyl terminus, and they lack a carboxyl-terminal phenylalanine, in contrast to other outer membrane proteins with no known secretion function. These results suggest that the P. syringae pv. syringae HrpH protein is involved in the secretion of a proteinaceous HR elicitor.
TI  - Survival of coliforms and bacterial pathogens within protozoa during chlorination.
AB  - The susceptibility of coliform bacteria and bacterial pathogens to free chlorine  residuals was determined before and after incubation with amoebae and ciliate protozoa. Viability of bacteria was quantified to determine their resistance to free chlorine residuals when ingested by laboratory strains of Acanthamoeba castellanii and Tetrahymena pyriformis. Cocultures of bacteria and protozoa were incubated to facilitate ingestion of the bacteria and then were chlorinated, neutralized, and sonicated to release intracellular bacteria. Qualitative susceptibility of protozoan strains to free chlorine was also assessed. Protozoa were shown to survive and grow after exposure to levels of free chlorine residuals that killed free-living bacteria. Ingested coliforms Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca and bacterial pathogens Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella sonnei, Legionella gormanii, and Campylobacter jejuni had increased resistance to free chlorine residuals. Bacteria could be cultured from within treated protozoans well after the time required for 99% inactivation of free-living cells. All bacterial pathogens were greater than 50-fold more resistant to free chlorine when ingested by T. pyriformis. Escherichia coli ingested by a Cyclidium sp., a ciliate isolated from a drinking water reservoir, were also shown to be more resistant to free chlorine. The mechanism that increased resistance appeared to be survival within protozoan cells. This study indicates that bacteria can survive ingestion by protozoa. This bacterium-protozoan association provides bacteria with increased resistance to free chlorine residuals which can lead to persistence of bacteria in chlorine-treated water. We propose that resistance to digestion by predatory protozoa was an evolutionary precursor of pathogenicity in bacteria and that today it is a mechanism for survival of fastidious bacteria in dilute and inhospitable aquatic environments.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new monobactam, B0-1165.
AB  - B0-1165 is a 1-carboxy-1-cyclopropoxyamino,4-fluoromethyl monobactam. It inhibited the majority of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Yersinia enterocolitica, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Salmonella and Shigella species at less than or equal to 0.125 microgram/ml. Overall, its in vitro activity was similar to that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime, with minor differences in the MICs for individual isolates. Enterobacter species and Citrobacter freundii which were derepressed for beta-lactamase production and had higher MICs of aztreonam and ceftazidime had MICs that ranged from 4 to 32 micrograms/ml. B0-1165 had activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa similar to that of aztreonam but lower than that of ceftazidime and carumonam. Pseudomonas maltophilia and other Pseudomonas species were resistant or had MICs of 32 micrograms/ml, as did Acinetobacter species. B0-1165 did not inhibit streptococcal, staphylococcal, or anaerobic species, such as Clostridium and Bacteroides species. B0-1165 was not hydrolyzed to any appreciable extent by common plasmid- and chromosomally Richmond-Sykes type 1a-, 1c-, and 1d-mediated beta-lactamases. It inhibited the Enterobacter cloacae P99 and inducible Pseudomonas aeruginosa beta-lactamases. B0-1165 was a poor inducer of beta-lactamase, but exposing E. cloacae and C. freundii to B0-1165 selected for resistant isolates. Overall, B0-1165 had in vitro properties similar to those of other monobactams currently available or under investigation.
TI  - [Utilization and fermentation of 2-ketogluconate by "Enterobacteriaceae" (author's transl)].
AB  - Two methods were compared: 1) the ability to use 2-ketogluconate (2-KG) as source of carbon and energy in defined medium, and 2) the ability to produce acid by fermentation of 2-KG (0.5 g/100 ml) in peptone water with phenol red. Results of growth on, and acid production from, 2-KG were identical. A total of 990 strains was studied. No strain of Escherichia coli, Shigella (4 species), Salmonella (4 sub-genera), Yersinia pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, Edwardsiella (2 species), Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. morganii, Providencia (2 species) could utilize 2-KG. All strains of Citrobacter (2 species), Levinea amalonatica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. ozaenae, Enterobacter (5 species), Serratia (6 species) utilize 2-KG as sole carbon source. Different reactions were given by strains of P. rettgeri, Y. enterocolitica and K. rhinoscleromatis.
TI  - [Interest of gamma-glutamyltransferase in "Enterobacteriaceae" (author's transl)].
AB  - Gamma-Glutamyltransferase (gammaGT) could be detected in 86,6% of 3,027 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, by the use of gamma-L-glutamin-p-nitranilide acid for substrate. The following species produced gamma GT: Citrobacter freundii, Levinea malonatica, L. amalonatica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. ozaenae, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, E. agglomerans, E. gergoviae, K. ozaenae, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, E. agglomerans, E. gergoviae, Hafnia alvei, Erwinia carotovora, Serratia marcescens, S. liquefaciens, S. plymuthica, S. marinorubra, S. odorifera, S. ficaria, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. morganii, P. rettgeri, Providencia alcalifaciens, P. stuartii, Yersinia enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis. Most strains of Escherichia coli and Alkalescens Dispar group are gamma GT+. The following species did not produce gammaGT: Shigella sonnei, Edwardsiella tarda, Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis and Yersinia pestis. Within the Salmonella, most strains of subgenus I, II and IV, and diphasic strains of subgenus III (S. arizonae) produced gamma GT, whereas monophasic strains of subgenus III did not produce gammaGT. Salmonella enteritidis (gammaGT+) and S. dublin (gammaGT-) can readily be distinguished. This test (gammaGT) could also serve as a biochemical marker for S. typhi-murium strains. Shigella dysenteriae serotypes 3 to 9 were gammaGT+ whereas other serotypes were gammaGT-. Within S. flexneri serotype 6, varieties Boyd 88 and Newcastle were found gammaGT+; and varieties Sussex and Manchester were gammaGT-. The use of gammaGT test as an epidemiological marker for other Shigella serotypes is suggested.
TI  - Evaluation of a pectin agar medium for isolation of Yersinia enterocolitica within 48 hours.
AB  - A modified pectin agar medium was evaluated for the rapid isolation and presumptive identification of Yersinia enterocolitica. Of 118 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae tested, only the 13Y. enterocolitica and the three Klebsiella oxytoca strains produced colonies that depressed and sank into the agar. Yersinia enterocolitica was also easily identified in mixed cultures, even from inocula containing three times as many other Enterobacteriaceae organisms as Y. enterocolitica. The recovery of Y. enterocolitica was evaluated on Mueller-Hinton, pectin, Hektoen enteric, xylose lysine desoxycholate, Salmonella-Shigella, and MacConkey agars. Compared with Mueller-Hinton agar, the pectin agar showed a 100% recovery of Y. enterocolitica, with all strains having depressed colonies, while the other media showed lesser recoveries of only 5 to 25%, with no other discriminating colonial characteristic.
