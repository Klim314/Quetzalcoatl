TI  == anti-inflammatory properties of fermented soy milk with lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis s-su2 in murine macrophage raw264.7 cells and dss-induced ibd model mice.
AB  == six lactic acid bacteria strains (four lactobacillus plantarum strains and one each of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and pediococcus pentosaceus) have been isolated and shown to possess anti-oxidant activity. in this study, we determined their acid, bile, salt resistance, and adhesion activity on human enterocyte-like ht-29-luc and caco-2 cells. an isolate lc. lactis s-su2 showed highest bile resistance and adhesion activity compared to type strains. s-su2 could ferment both 10% skimmed milk and soy milk while the type strain could not ferment soy milk. soy milk fermented with s-su2 showed an increased nitric oxide (no) secretion in the mouse macrophage raw264.7 cells without bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps). furthermore, the inhibitory effects of the fermented soy milk on escherichia coli o111 lps-induced no secretion were higher than those of fresh soy milk. inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) was induced in mice fed either 5% (w/v) dextran sodium sulfate (dss) in drinking water or 50% soy milk in drinking water. shortening of colon length, breaking of epithelial cells, lowering liver and thymus weights, and enlargement of spleen are some of the characteristics observed in the ibd, which were prevented by the use of soy milk  fermented with lc. lactis s-su2.

TI  == characterization, identification and application of lactic acid bacteria isolated from forage paddy rice silage.
AB  == there has been growing interest to develop forage rice as a new feed resource for livestock. this study was to characterize the natural population of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and select potentially excellent strains for paddy rice silage preparation in china. one hundred and twenty-six strains were isolated and screened from paddy rice silage prepared using a small-scale fermentation system, and ninety-nine of these isolates were considered to be lab based on their gram-positive and catalase-negative morphology and the production of most of their metabolic products as lactic acid. these isolates were divided into eight groups (a-h) on the basis of their morphological and biochemical characteristics. the group a to h strains were identified as lactobacillus (l.) plantarum subsp. plantarum (species ratio: 8.1%), l. casei (5.1%), leuconostoc (ln.) pseudomesenteroides (11.1%), pediococcus (p.) pentosaceus (24.2%), enterococcus (e.) mundtii (12.1%), lactococcus (lc.) garvieae (15.2%), e. faecium (9.1%) and lc. lactis subsp. lactis (15.2%) based on sequence analyses of their 16s rrna and reca genes. p. pentosaceus was the most abundant member of the lab population in  the paddy rice silage. a selected strain, namely l. casei r 465, was found to be  able to grow under low ph conditions and to improve the silage quality with low ph and a relatively high content of lactic acid. this study demonstrated that forage paddy rice silage contains abundant lab species and its silage can be well preserved by inoculation with lab, and that strain r 465 can be a potentially excellent inoculant for paddy rice silage.

TI  == biodiversity and gamma-aminobutyric acid production by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional alpine raw cow's milk cheeses.
AB  == "nostrano-cheeses" are traditional alpine cheeses made from raw cow's milk in trentino-alto adige, italy. this study identified lactic acid bacteria (lab) developing during maturation of "nostrano-cheeses" and evaluated their potential  to produce gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba), an immunologically active compound and neurotransmitter. cheese samples were collected on six cheese-making days, in three dairy factories located in different areas of trentino and at different stages of cheese ripening (24 h, 15 days, and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 months). a total  of 1,059 lab isolates were screened using random amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and differentiated into 583 clusters. lab strains from dominant clusters (n = 97) were genetically identified to species level by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. lab species most frequently isolated were lactobacillus paracasei, streptococcus thermophilus, and leuconostoc mesenteroides. the 97 dominant clusters were also characterized for their ability in producing gaba by  high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). about 71% of the dominant bacteria clusters evolving during cheeses ripening were able to produce gaba. most gaba producers were lactobacillus paracasei but other gaba producing species included  lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, pediococcus pentosaceus, and streptococcus thermophilus. no enterococcus faecalis or sc. macedonicus isolates produced gaba. the isolate producing the highest amount of gaba (80.0+/-2.7 mg/kg) was a sc. thermophilus.

TI  == isolation and molecular identification of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacterium spp. from faeces of the blue-fronted amazon parrot in brazil.
AB  == in brazil, the blue-fronted amazon parrot (amazona aestiva) is a common pet. the  faecal microbiota of these birds include a wide variety of bacterial species, the majority of which belong to the gram-positive lactic acid bacteria (lab) clade. the aim of this study was to investigate differences in the diversity and abundance of lab and bifidobacterium spp. in the cloacae between wild and captive birds and to select, identify and characterise lab for consideration as a parrot  probiotic. cloacal swabs were collected from 26 wild and 26 captive birds. bacterial dna was extracted, and the 16s rrna genes were amplified. the numbers of pcr-positive enterococcus, pediococcus, and lactobacillus species isolated from wild and captive birds were significantly different (p<0.05). enterococcus was the most frequently isolated genus, followed by pediococcus, lactobacillus, lactococcus and bifidobacterium. enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus coryniformis, lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and bifidobacterium bifidum were the most frequently isolated species from all birds. this study increases our understanding of the faecal microbiota, and may help to improve the nutrition and habitat management of captive and wild parrots. the bacterial population identified in the faecal microbiota of clinically healthy wild and captive parrots can serve as a database to analyse variations in the gut microbiota of pathogen-infected parrots and to develop probiotics specific to these genera.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic characterization of some lactic acid bacteria isolated from bee pollen: a preliminary study.
AB  == in the present work, five hundred and sixty-seven isolates of lactic acid bacteria were recovered from raw bee pollen grains. all isolates were screened for their antagonistic activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. neutralized supernatants of 54 lactic acid bacteria (lab) cultures from 216 active isolates inhibited the growth of indicator bacteria. they were phenotypically characterized, based on the fermentation of 39 carbohydrates. using the simple matching coefficient and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages (upgma), seven clusters with other two members were defined at the 79% similarity level. the following species were characterized: lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus acidilactici, pediococcus pentosaceus, and unidentified lactobacilli. phenotypic characteristics of major and minor clusters were also identified. partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene of representative isolates from each cluster was performed, and ten strains were assigned to seven species:  lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus ingluviei, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus acidipiscis and weissella cibaria. the molecular method used failed to determine the exact taxonomic status of bh0900 and ah3133.

TI  == prevalence of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria isolated from the faeces of broiler chicken in malaysia.
AB  == background: probiotics are commonly used as feed additive to substitute antibiotic as growth promoter in animal farming. probiotic consists of lactic acid bacteria (lab), which enhance the growth and health of the animal. probiotic also have higher possibility to become pathogenic bacteria that may carry antibiotic resistant gene that can be transmitted to other lab species. the aim of this study was to identify the lab species in the faeces of broiler chicken and to determine the prevalence of antibiotic resistant in lab of broiler chicken. methods: sixty faeces samples were collected from wet markets located in klang valley of malaysia for the isolation of lab using de-mann rogosa sharpe medium. thirteen species of lab were obtained in this study and the identification of lab was performed by using api test kit on the basis of carbohydrate fermentation profile. antibiotic susceptibility assay was then carried out to determine the prevalence of lab antibiotic resistance. results: lactococcus lactis subsp lactis was found in nine out of sixty faecal samples. lactobacillus paracasei was the second common lab species isolated from chicken faecal. no significant difference (p > 0.05) was found between the occurrence of  lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus plantarum, leuconostoc lactis mesenteroides subsp mesenteroides/dectranium and pediococcus pentosaceus isolated from 5 different locations. most of the isolated lab was resistant to antibiotic and high variability of the antibiotic resistance was observed among the lab against 15 types of antibiotics. penicillin, amoxicillin,  chloramphenicol, and ampicillin had significant higher (p< 0.05) inhibitory zone  than nalidixic acid, gentamycin, sulphamethoxazole, kanamycin, and streptomycin.  conclusions: many species of lab were isolated from the faecal samples of broiler chicken that resistance to the common antibiotics used in the farm. the development of resistant against antibiotics in lab can be attributed to the long term exposure of antibiotic as growth promoter and therapeutic agents. thus, it is essential to advise farmer the safety measure of antibiotic application in animal farming. additionally, the supplementation of probiotic in animal feeding  also needs more attention and close monitoring.

TI  == determination of the mode of action of enterolysin a, produced by enterococcus faecalis b9510.
AB  == aim: the current study aimed to visualize the damage caused by enterolysin a to the cells of sensitive strains and to find out cleavage site within the peptidoglycan moiety of bacterial cell walls. methods and results: enterolysin a  produced by a local isolate, enterococcus faecalis b9510 was found to rapidly kill cells of the sensitive strain lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris 2144 during 120 min of treatment as compared to the untreated control where no such effect was observed. transmission electron microscopy of the enterolysin a-treated cells revealed leaking of the cytoplasmic contents ultimately resulting in complete lysis of cell walls. to find the cleavage site, purified cell walls of l. lactis  ssp. cremoris 2144, pediococcus pentosaceus 43201 and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus atcc 11842 were treated with enterolysin a, and liberated amino acids were derivatized for n and c terminals and analysed using thin layer chromatography on silica gel with isopropanol as solvent. the results showed that enterolysin a cleaves the peptide bonds at two locations within peptidoglycan subunits. the first location is between l-alanine and d-glutamic acid of the stem peptide and the other location is between l-lysine of the stem peptide and d-aspartic acid of the interpeptide bridge. conclusions: enterolysin a cleaves the peptide bonds within the stem peptide as well as in the interpeptide bridge of gram-positive bacterial cell walls. this gives a possible reason for the broad spectrum of enterolysin a activity. significance and impact of the study: this is the first report identifying the cleavage site of enterolysin a within the cell walls of sensitive bacteria. this will help in identifying potential applications for enterolysin a.

TI  == the dominant microbial community associated with fermentation of obushera (sorghum and millet beverages) determined by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == obushera includes four fermented cereal beverages from uganda namely: obutoko, enturire, ekitiribita and obuteire, whose microbial diversity has not hitherto been fully investigated. knowledge of the microbial diversity and dynamics in these products is crucial for understanding their safety and development of appropriate starter cultures for controlled industrial processing. culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques including denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and mixed dna sequencing of polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) amplified ribosomal rna genes were used to study the bacteria and  yeast diversity of obushera. the ph dropped from 6.0-4.6 to 3.5-4.0 within 1-2 days for obutoko, enturire and obuteire whereas that of ekitiribita decreased to  4.4 after 4 days. counts of lactic acid bacteria (lab) increased from 5.0 to 11.0 log cfug(-1) and yeasts increased from 3.4 to 7.1 log cfug(-1) while coliform counts decreased from 2.0 to <1 log cfug(-1) during four days of fermentation. lab and yeast isolates were identified by rrna gene sequence analysis. lab isolates included: enterococcus spp., lactobacillus (lb.) plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus (s.) infantarius subsp. infantarius, pediococcus pentosaceus and weisella (w.) confusa. dgge indicated predominance of s. gallolyticus, s. infantarius subsp. infantarius, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, w. confusa, lb. reuteri, fructobacillus spp., l. lactis and l. lactis. yeast isolates included clavispora  lusitaniae, cyberlindnera fabianii, issatchenkia orientalis and saccharomyces cerevisiae. dgge indicated predominance of s. cerevisiae in obutoko, enturire and obuteire and also detected pichia spp. and i. orientalis in obutoko. obushera produced in the laboratory was initially dominated by enterobacteriaceae and later by lactococcus spp. enterobacteriaceae and bacillus spp. were also detected in ekitiribita. development of starters for obushera may require combinations of  lab and s. cerevisiae for obutoko, enturire and obuteire and lab for ekitiribita.

TI  == cultivable microbiota of lithobates catesbeianus and advances in the selection of lactic acid bacteria as biological control agents in raniculture.
AB  == the cultivable microbiota of skin and cloaca of captive lithobates catesbeianus includes microorganisms generally accepted as beneficial and potentially pathogenic bacteria. in order to select a group of potentially probiotic bacteria, 136 isolates were evaluated for their surface properties and production of antagonistic metabolites. then, 11 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains were selected and identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactococcus lactis, l. garvieae and enterococcus gallinarum. studies of compatibility indicate that all the strains could be included in a multi-strain probiotic, with the exception of ent. gallinarum crl 1826 which inhibited lab species through a bacteriocin-like metabolite. these results contribute to the design of a probiotic product to improve the sanitary status of bullfrogs in intensive culture systems, to avoid the use of antibiotics and thus  to reduce production costs. it could also be an alternative to prevent infectious diseases during the ex situ breeding of amphibian species under threat of extinction.

TI  == interactive effects of ph and temperature on the bacteriocin stability by response surface analysis.
AB  == the combined influence of ph and temperature on bacteriocins produced by three lactic acid bacteria, pediococcus pentosaceus mmz26, enterococcus faecium mmz17 and lactococcus lactis mmz25, isolated from tunisian traditional dry fermented meat was studied using a second order orthogonal factorial design and response-surface methodology (rsm). this method allows estimating the interactive effects of ph and temperature on the stability of each bacteriocin. the high heat stability of the three bacteriocins was demonstrated, with optimum values at light acidic ph around 5.0, temperature below 90 degrees c and short incubation times. this study contributes to a better understanding of relation between bacteriocins production and stability in order to enhance their, in situ, application as a food and feed biopreservative in fermented and/or heated food products.

TI  == identification and characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from mixed pasture of timothy and orchardgrass, and its badly preserved silage.
AB  == in order to understand the relationship between lactic acid bacteria (lab) species and silage fermentation, a total of 65 lab strains isolated from mixed pasture of timothy (phleum pratense l.) and orchardgrass (dactylis glomerata l.), and its badly preserved silages were subjected to phenotypic and genetic analysis. according to these analyses, the isolates were divided into 13 groups,  including enterococcus gallinarum, lactobacillus acidipiscis, l. coryniformis subsp. coryniformis, l. coryniformis subsp. torquens, l. curvatus, l. paraplantarum, l. plantarum subsp. argentoratensis, l. plantarum subsp. plantarum, l. sakei subsp. carnosus, lactococcus garvieae, lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, pediococcus acidilactici, pediococcus pentosaceus, weissella hellenica, weissella paramesenteroides and carnobacterium divergens. this is the first report to document that c. divergens, l. acidipiscis, l. sakei subsp. carnosus, l. garvieae, phenotypically novel l. lactis subsp. cremoris, e. gallinarum and w. hellenica are present in vegetative  forage crops. l. plantarum group strains were most frequently isolated from the badly preserved silages. some isolates showed a wide range of growth preferences  for carbohydrate utilization, optimal growth ph and temperature in vitro, indicating that they have a high growth potential. these results are useful in understanding the diversity of lab associated with decayed silage of timothy and  orchardgrass.

TI  == effects of wilting and molasses addition on fermentation and bacterial community  in guinea grass silage.
AB  == aims: acetic acid is considered an important preservative in tropical grass ensiling. the objective of the current experiments was to follow the ensiling fermentation of low dry matter (dm) tropical grass as a model to study changes in bacterial communities during acetic acid fermentation. methods and results: direct-cut and wilted guinea grass silage was prepared with and without molasses. a high acetic acid level was observed during the fermentation of direct-cut silage, and long storage increased the butyric acid and ethanol content if molasses was not added. the lactic acid production in wilted silage was greater than the acetic acid production, but prolonged ensiling decreased the lactic to acetic acid ratio regardless of molasses addition. adding molasses enhanced the lactic acid content in both direct-cut and wilted silage. the bacterial community, identified by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, was affected by wilting and molasses addition. bands for pantoea sp. and morganella sp. became faint when acetic acid fermentation was suppressed, and those for pediococcus pentosaceus and lactococcus garvieae were detected when lactic acid fermentation  was enhanced by wilting and molasses addition. lactobacillus plantarum and lactococcus lactis were found throughout the ensiling process in all silage types. conclusion: distinct changes occurred in the bacterial community in guinea grass silage because of wilting and molasses addition. these changes could explain how lactic acid fermentation was enhanced but could not help determine which bacteria were associated with enhanced acetic acid fermentation. significance and impact of the study: the study reveals the effects of wilting and molasses during ensiling of low dm tropical grasses and the associated bacteria.

TI  == homologues and bioengineered derivatives of ltnj vary in ability to form d-alanine in the lantibiotic lacticin 3147.
AB  == ltnalpha and ltnbeta are individual components of the two-peptide lantibiotic lacticin 3147 and are unusual in that, although ribosomally synthesized, they contain d-amino acids. these result from the dehydration of l-serine to dehydroalanine by ltnm and subsequent stereospecific hydrogenation to d-alanine by ltnj. homologues of ltnj are rare but have been identified in silico in staphylococcus aureus c55 (sacj), pediococcus pentosaceus fbb61 (penn), and nostoc punctiforme pcc73102 (npnj, previously called npunj [p. d. cotter et al.,  proc. natl. acad. sci. u. s. a. 102:18584-18589, 2005]). here, the ability of these enzymes to catalyze d-alanine formation in the lacticin 3147 system was assessed through heterologous enzyme production in a deltaltnj mutant. penn successfully incorporated d-alanines in both peptides, and sacj modified ltnalpha only, while npnj was unable to modify either peptide. site-directed mutagenesis was also employed to identify residues of key importance in ltnj. the most surprising outcome from these investigations was the generation of peptides by specific ltnj mutants which exhibited less bioactivity than those generated by the deltaltnj strain. we have established that the reduced activity of these peptides is due to the inability of the associated ltnj enzymes to generate d-alanine residues in a stereospecific manner, resulting in the presence of both  d- and l-alanines at the relevant locations in the lacticin 3147 peptides.

TI  == lysa2, the lactobacillus casei bacteriophage a2 lysin is an endopeptidase active  on a wide spectrum of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the lysin gene (lysa2) of the lactobacillus casei bacteriophage a2 was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. lysa2 is an endopeptidase that hydrolyzes the bond between the terminal d: -alanine of the peptidoglycan tetrapeptide and the aspartic acid residue that forms the bridge with the l: -lysine of a neighboring  peptidoglycan chain, characteristic of gram-positive bacteria included into the a4 peptidoglycan subgroup. this includes most lactobacilli, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus acidilactici, and pediococcus pentosaceus, the walls of all of which  were substrates for the enzyme. specific binding of lysa2 to the wall of these bacteria is mediated by its c-terminal moiety, does not need the n-terminal catalytic domain for recognition, and is stable: at least 88% of the molecules were still bound to l. casei after 3 days in phosphate buffer at 4 degrees c. the enzyme acts as a monomer, is active at ph values between 4 and 6, and at temperatures ranging between 18 degrees c and 50 degrees c while being independent of divalent cation addition. the enzyme showed strong resistance to incubation at high and low ph values but became progressively inactivated at 50 degrees c and above. lysa2 is bactericidal, the viability of l. casei cultures dropping to 1% in 10 min, under the standard conditions used for the enzymatic assay.

TI  == the spatial distribution of bacteria in grana-cheese during ripening.
AB  == the microbial composition and its spatial distribution of grana trentino, a hard  parmesan-like cheese, was determined, from vat milk to cheese. after cutting along the vertical axis of the cheese wheels, three layers were sampled diagonally across the cheese: under the cheese rind, an intermediate section and  the cheese core. after two different ripening periods (9 and 18 months), the cheese samples were analysed using traditional culture dependent and culture independent methods. milk samples were dominated by mesophilic and psychrophilic  bacterial counts. thermophilic bacteria (lactobacillus helveticus) were found in  high amounts in cooked whey and natural whey starter cultures. after 9 months of  ripening, lactic acid bacteria (lab) counts were higher than those after 18 months. furthermore, the lab numbers in the cheese core was lower than those under the rind or in the intermediate section. the main lab species isolated from milk (lactococcus lactis, pediococcus pentosaceus, streptococcus uberis and lactococcus garvieae) were not found in the corresponding cheeses. some differences were observed in the species composition among the three cheese sections. microbiota under the rind and in the intermediate section was similar and dominated by lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the core, after 18 months of ripening, was characterized by a total absence of lab. in each sample, all lab were genotypically grouped and the different biotypes were subjected to several technological tests indicating that some non-starter lab (nslab) displayed technological features that are favorable for the production of grana trentino cheese.

TI  == functional compounds in fermented buckwheat sprouts.
AB  == fermented buckwheat sprouts (fbs) are used as multifunctional foods. their production process includes fermentation with lactic acid bacteria. the major strains were found to include lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus pentosus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, and pediococcus pentosaceus in an investigation of the lactic acid bacteria. we searched for the  functional components, and nicotianamine (na) and 2''-hydroxynicotianamine (hna)  were identified as angiotensin i-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors. na and hna increased during fermentation. indole-3-ethanol was identified as an antioxidant  (a sod active substance), and may have been generated from tryptophan during fermentation because it was not contained in green buckwheat juice. a safety test demonstrated that fbs contained were safe functional food components, showing negative results in buckwheat allergy tests. any buckwheat allergy substances might have been degraded during the fermentation process.

AB  == the lactic acid bacterial (lab) community dynamics of two wheat and two spelt sourdough fermentations that were daily back-slopped were monitored during a period of 10 days by hybridizing time-related rna samples, representing the metatranscriptome, to an lab functional gene microarray. to indicate the species  present in each hybridized sample, annotation information for the 2,269 oligonucleotides on the microarray was used. the overall hybridization data revealed that after a transition phase of 5 days, in which atypical sourdough lab species, including enterococcus species, were found, a stabilized ecosystem was established with lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus fermentum as the dominating lab species. compared with the combined outcome of culture-dependent and culture-independent identification techniques, the microarray data revealed a functional role for lactococcus lactis in the early stage ecosystem and the dominance of pediococcus pentosaceus in most of the fermentations, besides l. plantarum and l. fermentum. consequently, metatranscriptome hybridization data obtained using an lab functional gene microarray was shown to be an interesting alternative to microbiological analysis of the community dynamics of complex food ecosystems.

TI  == characterisation and transferability of antibiotic resistance genes from lactic acid bacteria isolated from irish pork and beef abattoirs.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria isolated from irish pork and beef abattoirs were analysed for their susceptibility to antimicrobials. thirty-seven isolates (12 enterococci, 10 lactobacilli, 8 streptococci, 3 lactococci, 2 leuconostoc, and 2  pediococci) were examined for phenotypic resistance using the e-test and their minimum inhibitory concentration to a panel of six antibiotics (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and vancomycin) was recorded. the corresponding genetic determinants responsible were characterised by pcr. also, the transferability of these resistance markers was assessed in filter mating assays. of the 37 isolates, 33 were found to be resistant to one or more antibiotics. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin and chloramphenicol. the erm(b) and msra/b genes were detected among the 11 erythromycin-resistant strains of enterococci, lactobacilli, and streptococci. two tetracycline-resistant strains, lactobacillus plantarum and leuconostoc mesenteroides spp., contained tet(m) and tet(s) genes respectively. intrinsic streptomycin resistance was observed in lactobacilli, streptococci, lactococci and leuconostoc species; none of the common genetic determinants (stra, strb, aada, aade) were identified. four of 10 strains of enterococcus faecium were resistant to vancomycin; however, no corresponding genetic determinants for this  phenotype were identified. enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to vancomycin. l. plantarum, l. mesenteroides and pediococcus pentosaceus were intrinsically resistant to vancomycin. transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants was demonstrated in one strain, wherein the tet(m) gene of l. plantarum (23) isolated from a pork abattoir was transferred to lactococcus lactis bu-2-60 and to e. faecalis jh2-2. this study identified the presence of antibiotic resistance markers in irish meat isolates and, in one example, resistance was conjugally transferred to other lab strains.

TI  == development of a pcr assay for the strain-specific identification of probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1.
AB  == recent investigations clearly indicate that the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 can be incorporated into vegetables to obtain innovative probiotic foods whose marketing has been authorized by the italian ministry of health. in this study, strain impc2.1 was characterized at a molecular level in order to define its taxonomic position and to develop a pcr test for strain-specific identification. molecular methods, such as 16s rrna gene sequencing and multiplex pcr, have provided evidence that strain impc2.1 indeed belongs to the l. paracasei species. in addition, a cluster analysis of fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (f-aflp) data strongly indicated that strain impc2.1 and nine other l. paracasei strains (including strain atcc 334) belong to the same species and are definitely differentiated from the type strain l. casei atcc 393. the f-aflp technique was also used to identify a strain-specific dna fragment of l. paracasei impc2.1 - encoding an amino acid sequence similar to a glycosyltransferase of probiotic strain lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 - which enabled us to develop a rapid pcr test for  strain-specific identification. the strain-specificity of the pcr test was assessed by comparison with a total of 73 bacterial strains mainly isolated from  vegetable products that did not produce any amplified fragment. these strains belonged to the l. paracasei species, to 6 additional species of lactobacillus and to weissella cibaria, w. confusa, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides and pediococcus pentosaceus. a method similar to the one used in this study can be adopted to develop easy, rapid detection techniques for monitoring other bacteria in complex microbiota.

AB  == the objective of this work was to investigate the structure and diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in traditionally fermented meat collected  from different areas of tunisia. a polyphasic study, which involves phenotypic tests and ribosomal dna-based techniques, was used to identify gram-positive and  catalase-negative isolates. pcr amplification of the 16s-23s rdna isr of 102 isolates and other reference lab strains gave (1) one type of rrn operon (m-isr)  for lactococci, (2) two types of rrn operon (s-isr and m-isr) for enterococci, (3) two types of rrn operon (s-isr and l-isr) for lactobacilli, and (4) three pcr amplicons (s-isr, m-isr, and l-isr) obtained for pediococcus spp. and weissella genus. the clustering and comparison of isr-rflp profiles given by the isolates with those given by reference lab strains, allowed their identification as lactococcus lactis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus sanguinicola, enterococcus hawaiiensis, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus alimentarius, pediococcus pentosaceus, and weissella confusa. combined 16s-23s rdna isr and rflp patterns can be considered as a good potential target for a rapid and reliable differentiation between isolates of lab and provided further information on the organization of their rrn operons.

TI  == biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria in french wheat sourdough as determined by molecular characterization using species-specific pcr.
AB  == the lactic acid microflora of nine traditional wheat sourdoughs from the midi-pyrenees area (south western france) was previously isolated and preliminary characterized using conventional morphological and biochemical analysis. however, such phenotypic methods alone are not always reliable and have a low taxonomic resolution for identification of lactic acid bacteria species. in the present study, a total of 290 lab isolates were identified by pcr amplification using different sets of specific primers in order to provide a thorough characterization of the lactic flora from these traditional french sourdoughs. overall, the lab isolates belonged to 6 genera: lactobacillus (39%, 8 species), pediococcus (38%, 1 species), leuconostoc (17%, 2 species), weissella (4%, 2 species), lactococcus (1%, 1 species) and enterococcus (<1%, 1 species) and 15 different species were detected: l. plantarum, l. curvatus, l. paracasei, l. sanfranciscensis, l. pentosus, l. paraplantarum, l. sakei, l. brevis, p. pentosaceus, l. mesenteroides, l. citreum, w. cibaria, w. confusa, l. lactis and  e. hirae. facultative heterofermentative lab represent more than 76% of the total isolates, the main species isolated herein correspond to l. plantarum and p. pentosaceus. obligate heterofermentative lactobacilli (l. sanfranciscencis, l. brevis) represent less than 3% of the total isolates whereas leuconostoc and weissella species represent 21% of the total isolates and have been detected in eight of the nine samples. detection of some lab species was preferentially observed depending on the isolation culture medium. the number of different species within a sourdough varies from 3 to 7 and original associations of hetero- and homofermentative lab species have been revealed. results from this study clearly confirm the diversity encountered in the microbial community of traditional sourdough and highlight the importance of lab cocci in the sourdough  ecosystem, along with lactobacilli.

TI  == taxonomic structure and monitoring of the dominant population of lactic acid bacteria during wheat flour sourdough type i propagation using lactobacillus sanfranciscensis starters.
AB  == the structure and stability of the dominant lactic acid bacterium population were assessed during wheat flour sourdough type i propagation by using singly nine strains of lactobacillus sanfranciscensis. under back-slopping propagation with wheat flour type 0 f114, cell numbers of presumptive lactic acid bacteria varied  slightly between and within starters. as determined by randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr and restriction endonuclease analysis-pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analyses, only three (ls8, ls14, and ls44) starters dominated throughout 10 days of propagation. the others progressively decreased to less than 3 log cfu g(-1). partial sequence analysis of the 16s rrna and reca genes and pcr-denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis analysis using the rpob gene allowed identification of weissella confusa, lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rossiae, lactobacillus brevis, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, pediococcus pentosaceus, and lactobacillus spp. as the dominant species of the raw wheat flour. at the end of propagation, one autochthonous strain of l. sanfranciscensis was found in all the sourdoughs. except for l. brevis, strains of the above species were variously found in the mature sourdoughs. persistent starters were found in association with other biotypes of l. sanfranciscensis and with w. confusa or l. plantarum. sourdoughs were characterized for acidification, quotient of fermentation, free amino acids, and community-level catabolic profiles by using biolog 96-well eco microplates. in particular, catabolic profiles of sourdoughs containing persistent starters behaved similarly and were clearly differentiated from the others. the three persistent starters were further used for the production of sourdoughs and propagated by using another wheat flour whose lactic acid bacterium population in part differed from the previous one. also, in this case all three starter strains persisted during propagation.

TI  == method for reliable isolation of lactobacillus sakei strains originating from tunisian seafood and meat products.
AB  == in tunisia, several food products derived from meat or seafood are naturally processed, without any addition of bacterial starters. such fermented, dried-cured, salted, or marinated products, as well as the raw meat or fish may thus provide a source to isolate the natural microflora colonizing such environments. we isolated lactic acid bacteria from a representative range of flesh-foods sold or manufactured in different parts of tunisia, and selectively searched for lactobacillus sakei, a lactic acid bacterium potentially useful as starter or protective culture. eighty six (86) strains were isolated from various seafood (anchovy, sardine, sole, mullet, and octopus), or meat (pork, veal, beef, sheep, chicken, and turkey) products that were either fresh, or transformed by different traditional processes. several methods were used in order to develop a  rapid and reliable protocol for the direct identification of l. sakei. amplified  ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra) classified the various isolates into 9 distinct groups. search for the presence of the l. sakei specific kata gene indicated that all positive isolates were grouped in the same ardra group. sequencing of 16s rdna confirmed those isolates as l. sakei. those 22 different l. sakei strains represent 25.6% of the total isolates, while other isolates found in the different ardra groups were tentatively ascribed to lactobacillus plantarum, lactococcus lactis/garviae, enterococcus avium, streptococcus parauberis, hafnia alvei, pediococcus pentosaceus, and lactobacillus curvatus through 16s rdna sequencing. a fast and reliable method to isolate and discriminate l. sakei from complex food environments is proposed.

TI  == characterization and selection of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional iberian dry-fermented salchichon and chorizo sausages.
AB  == a total of 192 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from 2 types of naturally fermented dry sausages at 3 different stages of the ripening process in order to  select the most suitable strains as starter cultures in dry-cured sausage manufacture according to their technological characteristics such as glucose fermentation, lactic and acetic acid production, and proteolytic, lipolytic, and  antimicrobial activities. identification of the isolates revealed that 31.2% were pediococcus pentosaceus, 26.9% lactococcus lactis, 18.6% pediococcus acidilactici, 17% lactobacillus brevis, and sporadic isolates of leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus curvatus. most of the strains did not produce gas from glucose and showed the capacity to produce lactic acid rapidly. some 25% of the strains were able to degrade tributyrin (esterase activity), but none showed lipolytic activity against olive oil and pork fat. only 3 strains of p. acidilactici showed weak proteolytic activity against myofibrillar or sarcoplasmic proteins. also, the same strains showed antimicrobial activity against listeria monocytogenes. nine strains with the best properties were preselected and tested for biogenic amine production. the results showed that two of the strains, identified as p. acidilactici by polymerase chain reaction, had the potential to be further tested as starter cultures in pilot processing of iberian sausages.

TI  == redox potential to discriminate among species of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == aims: to verify to what degree reducing capacity is a characterizing parameter of a species, and of the strains themselves within a given species, of lactic acid bacteria. methods and results: eighty-eight strains belonging to 10 species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from traditional italian cheeses were studied for their reduction activity: enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis,  lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus and pediococcus pentosaceus. it was observed that the lactococci reached minimum redox potential  before the lactobacilli. the reduction rate of enterococcus spp. and l. lactis ssp. lactis was higher than that of the streptococci and lactobacillus spp. all the p. pentosaceus strains had poor reduction activity compared with the other species. conclusions: the evolution of the redox potential in milk over a time span of 24 h has been found to be a parameter that characterizes a species: the different courses corresponding to the species in question are clearly evident, and interesting differences can also be noted within the same species. significance and impact of the study: the reduction aptitude of strains might be  used to select and adapt appropriate strains for use as starters for dairy products.

TI  == susceptibility of pediococcus spp. to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == aim: to investigate the susceptibility of pediococcus species to antimicrobial agents. methods and results: the susceptibility to 14 antimicrobial agents of 31  genotypically distinct strains of six pediococcus species was assessed by using etests on iso-sensitest agar supplemented with horse blood. the species included  were pediococcus acidilactici, pediococcus damnosus, pediococcus dextrinicus, pediococcus inopinatus, pediococcus parvulus and pediococcus pentosaceus. for several antimicrobial agents, some species were more susceptible than others. the two industrially important species, p. acidilactici and p. pentosaceus, differed  with respect to erythromycin and trovafloxacin susceptibility, and in general both species had higher minimum inhibitory concentrations than the other species. in an erythromycin-resistant p. acidilactici, an erythromycin resistance methylase b [erm(b)] gene was identified by pcr. using a plasmid preparation from strain p. acidilactici 6990, a previously erythromycin-sensitive lactococcus lactis strain was made resistant. transformants harboured a single plasmid, sized at 11.6 kb through sequence analysis. in addition, the erm(b) gene was identified within the plasmid sequence. conclusions: the phenotypic test indicated the absence of acquired antimicrobial resistance genes in 30 of the strains. significance and impact of the study: these results will help in selection of the best pediococcus strains for use as starter cultures.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == use of real time pcr to determine population profiles of individual species of lactic acid bacteria in alfalfa silage and stored corn stover.
AB  == real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) was used to quantify seven species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in alfalfa silage prepared in the presence or absence of four commercial inoculants and in uninoculated corn stover harvested and stored under a variety of field conditions. species-specific pcr primers were designed based on reca gene sequences. commercial inoculants improved the quality of alfalfa silage, but species corresponding to those in the inoculants displayed variations in persistence over the next 96 h. lactobacillus brevis was the most abundant lab (12 to 32% of total sample dna) in all of the alfalfa silages by 96  h. modest populations (up to 10%) of lactobacillus plantarum were also observed in inoculated silages. pediococcus pentosaceus populations increased over time but did not exceed 2% of the total. small populations (0.1 to 1%) of lactobacillus buchneri and lactococcus lactis were observed in all silages, while lactobacillus pentosus and enterococcus faecium were near or below detection limits. corn stover generally displayed higher populations of l. plantarum and l. brevis and lower populations of other lab species. the data illustrate the utility of rt-pcr for quantifying individual species of lab in conserved forages  prepared under a wide variety of conditions.

AB  == lactic acid bacteria isolated from boza, a cereal-fermented beverage from belogratchik, bulgaria, were screened for the production of bacteriocins. with the first screening, 13 of the 52 isolates inhibited the growth of listeria innocua and lactobacillus plantarum. the cell-free supernatant of one of these strains, classified as leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum st99, inhibited the growth of bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, several lactobacillus spp., lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus thermophilus. clostridium spp., carnobacterium spp., l. mesenteroides and gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited. maximum antimicrobial activity, i.e. 6,400 arbitrary units (au)/ml, was recorded in mrs broth after 24 h at 30 degrees c. incubation in the presence of protease iv and pronase e resulted in loss of antimicrobial activity, confirming that growth inhibition was caused by a bacteriocin, designated here as mesentericin st99. no  loss in activity was recorded after treatment with alpha-amylase, sds, tween 20,  tween 80, urea, triton x-100, n-laurylsarcosin, edta and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. mesentericin st99 remained active after 30 min at 121 degrees c and after 2 h of incubation at ph 2 to 12. metabolically active cells of l. innocua treated with mesentericin st99 did not undergo lysis. mesentericin st99 did not adhere to the cell surface of strain st99. precipitation with ammonium sulfate (70% saturation), followed by sep-pack c18 chromatography and reverse-phase hplc on a c18 nucleosil column yielded one antimicrobial peptide.

AB  == aims: to evaluate the autolytic phenotype of pediococcus acidilactici and p. pentosaceus, the peptidoglycan hydrolases content and the effect of pediocin ach/pa-1 and autolysins on cell lysis. methods and results: the autolytic phenotype of pediococcus strains was evaluated under starvation conditions in potassium phosphate buffer. the strains tested showed an extent of autolysis ranging between 40 and 90% after 48 h of starvation at 37 degrees c. peptidoglycan hydrolase content was evaluated by renaturing sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) using cells of micrococcus lysodeikticus as a target for the enzymatic activity and a major activity band migrating at about 116 kda was detected. additional secondary lytic bands migrating in a range of molecular weight between 45 and 110 kda were also detected. the lytic activity, evaluated in the presence of different chemicals, was retained in 15 mm cacl2 and in a range of ph between 5 and 9.5 but was strongly reduced in presence of 8% nacl and in the presence of protease inhibitors. the substrate specificity of peptidoglycan hydrolases of pediococcus  strains was evaluated in renaturing sds-page incorporating cells of different bacterial species. lytic activity was detected against cells of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus  and listeria monocytogenes. the interaction between pediocin ach/pa-1 and autolysis was evaluated and a relevant effect of bacteriocin in cell-induced lysis was observed. conclusions: the autolytic phenotype is widely distributed among p. acidilactici and p. pentosaceus and the rate of autolysis is high in the majority of the analysed strains. several autolytic bands, detected by renaturing sds-page, retained their activity against several lactic acid bacteria and l. monocytogenes. significance and impact of the study: the characterization of the  autolytic phenotype of pediococcus acidilactici and p. pentosaceus strains should expand the knowledge of their role in fermentation processes where these species  occur as primary or secondary bacterial population.

AB  == a total of 161 low-g+c-content gram-positive bacteria isolated from whole-crop paddy rice silage were classified and subjected to phenotypic and genetic analyses. based on morphological and biochemical characters, these presumptive lactic acid bacterium (lab) isolates were divided into 10 groups that included members of the genera enterococcus, lactobacillus, lactococcus, leuconostoc, pediococcus, and weissella: analysis of the 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) was used to  confirm the presence of the predominant groups indicated by phenotypic analysis and to determine the phylogenetic affiliation of representative strains. the virtually complete 16s rrna gene was pcr amplified and sequenced. the sequences from the various lab isolates showed high degrees of similarity to those of the genbank reference strains (between 98.7 and 99.8%). phylogenetic trees based on the 16s rdna sequence displayed high consistency, with nodes supported by high bootstrap values. with the exception of one species, the genetic data was in agreement with the phenotypic identification. the prevalent lab, predominantly homofermentative (66%), consisted of lactobacillus plantarum (24%), lactococcus lactis (22%), leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (20%), pediococcus acidilactici (11%), lactobacillus brevis (11%), enterococcus faecalis (7%), weissella kimchii  (3%), and pediococcus pentosaceus (2%). the present study, the first to fully document rice-associated lab, showed a very diverse community of lab with a relatively high number of species involved in the fermentation process of paddy rice silage. the comprehensive 16s rdna-based approach to describing lab community structure was valuable in revealing the large diversity of bacteria inhabiting paddy rice silage and enabling the future design of appropriate inoculants aimed at improving its fermentation quality.

AB  == a new, coculture-inducible two-peptide bacteriocin named plantaricin nc8 (plnc8)  was isolated from lactobacillus plantarum nc8 cultures which had been induced with lactococcus lactis mg1363 or pediococcus pentosaceus fbb63. this bacteriocin consists of two distinct peptides, named alpha and beta, which were separated by  c(2)-c(18) reverse-phase chromatography and whose complementary action is necessary for full plantaricin nc8 activity. n-terminal sequencing of both purified peptides showed 28 and 34 amino acids residues for plnc8 alpha and plnc8 beta, respectively, which showed no sequence similarity to other known bacteriocins. mass spectrometry analysis showed molecular masses of 3,587 da (alpha) and 4,000 da (beta). the corresponding genes, designated plnc8a and plnc8b, were sequenced, and their nucleotide sequences revealed that both peptides are produced as bacteriocin precursors of 47 and 55 amino acids, respectively, which include n-terminal leader sequences of the double-glycine type. the mature alpha and beta peptides contain 29 and 34 amino acids, respectively. an open reading frame, orfc, which encodes a putative immunity protein was found downstream of plnc8b and overlapping plnc8a. upstream of the putative -35 region of plnc8b, two direct repeats of 9 bp were identified, which  agrees with the consensus sequence and structure of promoters of class ii bacteriocin operons whose expression is dependent on an autoinduction mechanism.

TI  == conservation of the major cold shock protein in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == primers designed from consensus regions of the major cold shock gene of different bacterial species were used in pcr amplification of lactic acid bacteria (lab). an appropriately-sized pcr product was obtained from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ll43-1 and mg1363; lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris lc10-1, lc11-1, and  lc12-1; streptococcus thermophilus st1-1; enterococcus faecalis ef1-1; lactobacillus acidophilus la1-1; lactobacillus helveticus lh1-1; pediococcus pentosaceus pp1-1; and bifidobacterium animalis ba1-1. the pcr products were cloned and sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequences displayed high sequence similarity with the major cold shock proteins of escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis and the human y-box factor. the amino acid residues of the cold shock domain implicated in nucleic acid binding in several unrelated species were also  highly conserved in the lab strains. it is possible, therefore, that this protein in lab may also act as a transcriptional enhancer to other cold shock genes and/or act as an rna chaperone unwinding tightly folded rna molecules.

AB  == a food-grade vector system was developed that allows stable integration of multiple plasmid copies in the chromosome of lactococcus lactis. the vector consists of the plus origin of replication (ori+) of the lactococcal plasmid pwv01, the sucrose genes of the lactic acid bacterium pediococcus pentosaceus ppe1.0 as selectable marker, a multiple-cloning site, and a lactococcal dna fragment of a well-characterized chromosomal region. the system includes two l. lactis strains, ll108 and ll302, which produce the pwv01 repa protein essential for replication of the ori+ vectors. these helper strains allow the construction  and isolation of the replicating form of the integration plasmids from a homologous background. single-crossover integration of the plasmids in l. lactis  mg1363 resulted in amplifications to a level of approximately 20 copies/chromosome after selection of the transformants on medium containing sucrose as the only fermentable sugar. the amplifications were stable under selective growth conditions. in glucose-containing medium a limited loss of integrated plasmid copies was detected at a rate of (7.5-15) x 10(-2) copies per  generation. one strain, mg124, was isolated that had retained 11 integrated copies after a period of 120 generations of non-selective growth. these results show that the single-cross-over integration system described here represents a simple procedure for the engineering of stable food-grade strains carrying multiple copies of a gene of interest.

TI  == purification and partial characterization of a tripeptidase from pediococcus pentosaceus k9.2.
AB  == a tripeptidase was purified from the cytoplasm of pediococcus pentosaceus k9.2 by anion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, and high-performance liquid chromatography. the molecular mass of the enzyme was estimated by gel filtration at 100,000 da. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide  gel electrophoresis of the purified peptidase showed one protein band of 45,000 da. optimal enzyme activity was obtained at ph 7.0 and at 50 degrees c. the peptidase hydrolyzed all tripeptides tested. cleavage was not observed with dipeptides, oligopeptides, or amino acid-p-nitroanilide derivatives. strong inhibition of activity was caused by edta, 1,10-phenanthroline, dithiothreitol, and beta-mercaptoethanol, whereas phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and sulfur-reactive reagents had no effect on peptidase activity. mg2+, mn2+, and ca2+ stimulated the hydrolyzing activity of the enzyme. the 20 n-terminal amino acids of the tripeptidase from p. pentosaceus had 84% identity with those from the corresponding n-terminal region of the tripeptidase from lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris wg2.

TI  == identification of a cold shock gene in lactic acid bacteria and the effect of cold shock on cryotolerance.
AB  == when lactic acid bacterial cultures were frozen at -20 degrees c for 24 h, the cell viability decreased drastically, but when they were cold shocked at 10 degrees c for 2 h prior to freezing, viability improved significantly for the lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis strains (25-37%) and pediococcus pentosaceus po2 (18%), but not for the lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris strains tested or for one strain of lactobacillus helveticus lb1 and streptococcus thermophilus ts2. when the period for cold shock was extended to 5 h, the viability increased even  further for those strains that displayed cold shock cryotolerance. use of degenerate pcr primers based on the major cold shock protein (csp) of both escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis resulted in pcr products from all strains  tested. the pcr product from lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis m474 was cloned and sequenced, and the deduced amino acid sequence displayed a high sequence similarity to other csp's. use of pcr primers based on the m474 sequence resulted in pcr products being produced only from the lactococcal strains studied and not  from the lactobacillus helveticus, streptococcus thermophilus, or pediococcus pentosaceus strains tested.

TI  == molecular characterization of the replicon of the pediococcus pentosaceus 43200 pediocin a plasmid pmd136.
AB  == the pediocin a-encoding plasmid of pediococcus pentosaceus 43200, pmd136, was characterized by restriction enzyme analysis. analysis of its replicon was facilitated by the construction of a probe vector consisting of the escherichia coli plasmid psp72 and the cat gene from staphylococcus aureus plasmid pc194. the replication region of pmd136 was localized on a 1.6-kb ecori/bglii fragment. sequencing analysis revealed a non-coding region, repa, spanning the first 440 bp, followed by an open reading frame, repb, encoding a putative protein of 390 amino acids. the non-coding region contained two sets of 6-bp and two sets of 22-bp direct repeats and two sets of inverted repeats upstream of the open reading frame. strong homology of the isolated replicon was found to theta-type replicons of lactococcus lactis plasmids. segregational stability assay suggested at least two regions as potentially involved in the stabilization of pmd136. the  plasmid's strong homology to other theta-type replicons and its relatively high stability suggest that pmd136 belongs to the widespread family of theta-replication plasmids.

TI  == chemical composition of the cell wall of lactic acid bacteria and related species.
AB  == in order to examine the relationship between biological activities and the cell wall content, the murein type and the teichoic acid of the cell wall from five strains of bacteria were studied. two of these lactobacillus casei crl 431 and l. acidophilus crl 730, are used in a commercial fermented milk (bio milk), which is believed to be beneficial for health. the other strains, lactococcus lactis crl 526, pediococcus pentosaceus crl 923 and propionibacterium acidipropionici crl 1198 were included in order to compare the cell wall structures of active and inactive strains. a method was designed to confirm the amino acids of the peptidoglycan in impure substrates. four of the studied strains, l. casei, l. acidophilus, l. lactis and p. acidipropionici, contained glycerol teichoic acids. l. casei, l. acidophilus, p. pentosaceus and l. lactis contained a4 alpha type murein, while p. acidipropionici contained a3 gamma type. the capacity of orally  administered peptidoglycans of the studied strains to stimulate phagocytosis by mouse peritoneal macrophages was analyzed. only the pg of l. casei showed this activity. no differences were observed between active and inactive strains with respect to the chemical composition of the peptidoglycan. therefore the biological activity is unlikely to be due to the peptidoglycan structure.

TI  == proinflammatory effect of pediococcus pentosaceus, a bacterium used as hay preservative.
AB  == bacterial cultures, such as pediococcus pentosaceus, are used to treat hay with the objective of preventing hay heating and moulding, and thus, the development of the microbial growth which causes farmer's lung. the aim of this study was to  investigate whether such bacterial cultures have the potential to induce a pulmonary inflammatory response. mice were instilled 3 days week-1 for 3 weeks with either saline or nonviable preparations of p. pentosaceus, saccharopolyspora rectivirgula, lactococcus lactis (control bacteria) or with the combinations of s. rectivirgula and p. pentosaceus. p. pentosaceus induced a significant inflammatory response in the lung which was similar to that produced by s. rectivirgula. l. lactis produced a response of a lower intensity. the total number of cells in bronchoalveolar lavage were: s. rectivirgula: 6.4 x 10(5) cells.ml-1; p. pentosaceus: 4.3 x 10(5) cells.ml-1; s. rectivirgula + p. pentosaceus: 5.4 x 10(5) cells.ml-1, l. lactis: 6.8 x 10(5) cells.ml-1 and saline group 3.7 x 10(4) cells.ml-1. the lung index was higher in s. rectivirgula+p. pentosaceus and p. pentosaceus groups than in s. rectivirgula, l. lactis and saline groups. the quantity of specific immunoglobulin g and a (igg and iga) to p. pentosaceus and l. lactis levels (in the blood and/or lavage fluid) were similar to those against s. rectivirgula. in mice, p. pentosaceus has the potential to induce a similar inflammatory response in the lung as s. rectivirgula, which is the most common antigen responsible for farmer's lung disease in quebec. further studies are needed to verify whether farmers can develop farmer's lung or other lung responses to this new potential antigen.

TI  == the effect of cations on the hydrolysis of lactose and the transferase reactions  catalysed by beta-galactosidase from six strains of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == beta-galactosidases from lactobacillus delbruekii subsp. bulgaricus 20056, lb. casei 20094, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 7962, streptococcus thermophilus ts2, pediococcus pentosaceus pe39 and bifidobacterium bifidum 1901 were partially purified. the rate of hydrolysis of lactose given by the predominant beta-galactosidase activity from each of the bacteria studied was in all cases enhanced by mg2+, while the effect of k+ and na+ differed from strain to strain.  the beta-galactosidases from all strains also catalysed trans-galactosylation reactions. the types of oligosaccharides produced appeared to be very similar in  each case, but the rates of their production differed. all the beta-galactosidases were also capable of hydrolysing galactosyl-lactose although, unlike the other bacteria studied, lb. delbruekii subsp. bulgaricus 20056 and lc. lactis subsp. lactis 7962 were unable to utilise galactosyl-lactose as a carbon source for growth.

TI  == development and characterization of lactose-positive pediococcus species for milk fermentation.
AB  == bacteriophages against streptococcus thermophilus are a growing problem in the italian cheese industry. one possible control method involves replacing s. thermophilus in mozzarella starter blends with lactic acid bacteria from a different genus or species. in this study, we evaluated lactose-positive pediococci for this application. because we could not identify any commercially available pediococci with fast acid-producing ability in milk, we transformed pediococcus pentosaceus atcc 25744, p. pentosaceus atcc 25745, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 12697 by electroporation with ppn-1, a 35-kb lactococcus lactis lactose plasmid. transformants of p. pentosaceus atcc 25745 and p. acidilactici atcc 12697 were then used to examine lactose-positive pediococci for properties related to milk fermentation. both transformants rapidly produced acid and efficiently retained ppn-1 in lactose broth, and neither bacterium was attacked by bacteriophages in whey collected from commercial cheese facilities. paired starter combinations of pediococcus spp. and lactobacillus helveticus lh100 exhibited synergistic ph reduction in milk, and small-scale cheese trials showed  that these cultures could be used to manufacture part-skim mozzarella cheese. results demonstrate that lactose-positive pediococci have potential as replacement cocci for s. thermophilus in italian cheese starter blends and may facilitate development of new strain rotation schemes to combat s. thermophilus bacteriophage problems in mozzarella cheese plants.

TI  == attachment of lactic acid bacteria to beef-muscle surfaces.
AB  == the effect of immersion time and cell concentration in the attachment of several  lactic acid bacteria with antibacterial activity to beef-muscle surface was studied. the number of firmly attached bacteria increased with immersion time in  the case of pediococcus acidilacti, lactobacillus sake, lactococcus cremoris (two strains) and pediococcus acidilacti. pediococcus pentosaceus, lactococcus lactis  and lactobacillus curvatus reached maximum adhesion after 15-30 min. the highest  strength of attachment (sr values) were observed after 15-30 min of contact time  except for p. pentosaceus. for all strains, the number of bacteria adhering to meat increased with increasing cell concentration in the adhesion medium. the highest strength of attachment was observed at a cell concentration of 10(5)/ml mainly for l. sake, l. lactis and l. cremoris. due to their attachment characteristics, l. sake, l. lactis and l. cremoris are proposed as potential biocontrol agents because they could grow on meat surface and limit the potential attachment of pathogenic microorganisms.

TI  == monoclonal antibody-based enzyme immunoassay for pediocins of pediococcus acidilactici.
AB  == monoclonal antibody (mab) r2-ar against pediocin rs2 was developed. mice were immunized for 12 weeks with pediocin rs2 conjugated to a polyacrylamide gel. two  hybridoma fusions yielded an mab that in western blots (immunoblots) reacted only with pediocins rs2 and ach (3 kda) from pediococcus acidilactici rs2 and h, respectively, and did not react with any other bacteriocin, including sakacin a from lactobacillus sake lb 706, leuconocin lcm1 from leuconostoc carnosum lm1, nisin from lactococcus lactis atcc 11454, and pediocin a from pediococcus pentosaceus fbb61. each of the bacteriocin bands on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels was confirmed to be biologically  active by a gel overlay test performed with sensitive indicator organisms. in dot immunoblot assays, the mab could detect a minimum of 32,000 arbitrary units of pediocin rs2 or ach per ml. in colony immunoblot assays, the mab was used successfully to differentiate bac+ and bac- variants of p. acidilactici rs2 strains.

TI  == characterization and frequency distribution of species of lactic acid bacteria involved in the processing of mawe, a fermented maize dough from benin.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria involved in the natural fermentation of both home-produced and commercial mawe were investigated during a 72 h fermentation period. lactobacillus spp. constitute the majority (94%) of the strains of the lactic acid bacteria isolated, among which 89% represent the betabacterium group. they include l. fermentum (biotype cellobiosus) (41%), l. fermentum or l. reuteri (19%), l. brevis (26%), l. confusus (less than 2%), l. curvatus (less than 1%) and l. buchneri (less than 1%). other isolated lactic acid bacteria were l. salivarius, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus pentosaceus, pediococcus acidilactici and leuconostoc mesenteroides. several species were detected at the early stage of fermentation, but the final stage was dominated by l. fermentum (biotype cellobiosus) and l. fermentum or l. reuteri totalling 90% of the isolated strains. the trend was the same for both home-produced and commercial mawe. no strains of l. plantarum, generally reported as dominating lactic acid bacteria at the final stage of fermentation of most plant foods, were isolated.

TI  == bacteriocin-mediated inhibition of clostridium botulinum spores by lactic acid bacteria at refrigeration and abuse temperatures.
AB  == the bacteriocinogenicity of lactococcus lactis atcc 11454, pediococcus pentosaceus atcc 43200, p. pentosaceus atcc 43201, lactobacillus plantarum bn, l. plantarum lb592, l. plantarum lb75, and lactobacillus acidophilus n2 against clostridium botulinum spores at 4, 10, 15, and 35 degrees c was investigated by modified deferred and simultaneous antagonism methods. all the strains, except l. acidophilus n2, produced inhibition zones on lawns of c. botulinum spores at 30 degrees c. l. plantarum bn, l. lactis atcc 11454, and p. pentosaceus atcc 43200 and 43201 were bacteriocinogenic at 4, 10, and 15 degrees c. supplementation of brain heart infusion agar with 0 to 5% nacl increased the radii of inhibition zones during simultaneous antagonism assays. detectable bacteriocin activities were extracted from freeze-thawed agar cultures of l. plantarum bn and l. lactis  atcc 11454 which had been grown at 4 and 10 degrees c. these results suggest that low levels of l. plantarum bn or l. lactis atcc 11454, in the presence of 3 or 4% nacl, could be formulated into minimally processed refrigerated food products for protection against possible botulism hazards.
