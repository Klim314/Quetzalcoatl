TI  == a tyrosine phosphorylation switch controls the interaction between the transmembrane modulator protein wzd and the tyrosine kinase wze of lactobacillus  rhamnosus.
AB  == background: one proposed mechanism for assembly of secreted heteropolysaccharides by many gram positive bacteria relies on the coordinated action of a polymerization complex through reversible phosphorylation events. the role of the tyrosine protein kinase transmembrane modulator is, however, not well understood. results: the protein sequences deduced from the wzb, wzd and wze genes from lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 9595 and rw-9595 m contain motifs also found in corresponding proteins cpsb, cpsc and cpsd from streptococcus pneumoniae d39 (serotype 2). use of an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody demonstrated that both wzd  and wze can be found in tyrosine phosphorylated form. when tyrosine 266 was mutated to phenylalanine, wzdy266f showed slightly less phosphorylated protein than those produced by using eight other tyrosine mutated wzd genes, when expressed along with wze and wzb in lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris mg1363. in order to demonstrate the importance of atp for the interactions among these proteins, native and fusion wzb, wzd and wze proteins were expressed and purified from escherichia coli cultures. the modulator protein, wzd, binds with the phosphotyrosine kinase wze, irrespective of its phosphorylation status. however,  wze attained a higher phosphorylation level after interacting with phosphorylated wzd in the presence of 10 mm atp. this highly phosphorylated wze did not remain in close association with phosphorylated wzd. conclusion: the wze tyrosine kinase protein of lactobacillus rhamnosus thus carries out tyrosine phosphorylation of wzd in addition to auto- and trans- phosphorylation of the kinase itself.

TI  == probiotic potential of selected lactic acid bacteria strains isolated from brazilian kefir grains.
AB  == a total of 34 lactic acid bacteria isolates from 4 different brazilian kefir grains were identified and characterized among a group of 150 isolates, using the ability to tolerate acidic ph and resistance to bile salts as restrictive criteria for probiotic potential. all isolates were identified by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis and 16s rdna sequencing of representative amplicons. eighteen isolates belonged to the species leuconostoc mesenteroides, 11 to lactococcus lactis (of which 8 belonged to subspecies cremoris and 3 to subspecies lactis), and 5 to lactobacillus paracasei. to exclude replicates, a molecular typing analysis was performed by combining repetitive extragenic palindromic-pcr and random amplification of polymorphic dna techniques. considering a threshold of 90% similarity, 32 different strains were considered.  all strains showed some antagonistic activity against 4 model food pathogens. in  addition, 3 lc. lactis strains and 1 lb. paracasei produced bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances against at least 2 indicator organisms. moreover, 1 lc. lactis and 2 lb. paracasei presented good total antioxidative activity. none of these strains showed undesirable enzymatic or hemolytic activities, while proving susceptible or intrinsically resistant to a series of clinically relevant antibiotics. the lb. paracasei strain mrs59 showed a level of adhesion to human caco-2 epithelial cells comparable with that observed for lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. taken together, these properties allow the mrs59 strain to be considered a promising probiotic candidate.

TI  == biodiversity and gamma-aminobutyric acid production by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional alpine raw cow's milk cheeses.
AB  == "nostrano-cheeses" are traditional alpine cheeses made from raw cow's milk in trentino-alto adige, italy. this study identified lactic acid bacteria (lab) developing during maturation of "nostrano-cheeses" and evaluated their potential  to produce gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba), an immunologically active compound and neurotransmitter. cheese samples were collected on six cheese-making days, in three dairy factories located in different areas of trentino and at different stages of cheese ripening (24 h, 15 days, and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 months). a total  of 1,059 lab isolates were screened using random amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and differentiated into 583 clusters. lab strains from dominant clusters (n = 97) were genetically identified to species level by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. lab species most frequently isolated were lactobacillus paracasei, streptococcus thermophilus, and leuconostoc mesenteroides. the 97 dominant clusters were also characterized for their ability in producing gaba by  high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). about 71% of the dominant bacteria clusters evolving during cheeses ripening were able to produce gaba. most gaba producers were lactobacillus paracasei but other gaba producing species included  lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, pediococcus pentosaceus, and streptococcus thermophilus. no enterococcus faecalis or sc. macedonicus isolates produced gaba. the isolate producing the highest amount of gaba (80.0+/-2.7 mg/kg) was a sc. thermophilus.

TI  == phenotypical analysis of the lactobacillus rhamnosus gg fimbrial spafed operon: surface expression and functional characterization of recombinant spafed pili in  lactococcus lactis.
AB  == a noticeable genomic feature of many piliated gram-positive bacterial species is  the presence of more than one pilus-encoding operon. paradigmatically, the gut-adapted lactobacillus rhamnosus gg strain contains two different fimbrial operons in its genome. however, whereas one of these operons (called spacba) is encoding for the functionally mucus-/collagen-binding spacba pilus, for the other operon (called spafed) any native expression of the spafed-called pili is still the subject of some uncertainty. irrespective of such considerations, we decided  it would be of relevance or interest to decipher the gross structure of this pilus type, and as well assess its functional capabilities for cellular adhesion  and immunostimulation. for this, and by following the approach we had used previously to explicate the immuno-properties of spacba pili, we constructed nisin-inducible expression clones producing either wild-type or spaf pilin-deleted surface-assembled l. rhamnosus gg spafed pili on lactococcus lactis cells. using these piliated lactococcal constructs, we found that the pilin-polymerized architecture of a recombinant-produced spafed pilus coincides with sequence-based functional predictions of the related pilins, and in fact is  prototypical of those other sortase-dependent pilus-like structures thus far characterized for piliated gram-positive bacteria. moreover, we confirmed that among the different pilin subunits encompassing spafed operon-encoded pili, the spaf pilin is a main adhesion determinant, and when present in the assembled structure can mediate pilus binding to mucus, certain extracellular matrix proteins, and different gut epithelial cell lines. however, somewhat unexpectedly, when recombinant spafed pili are surface-attached, we found that they could not potentiate the existing lactococcal cell-induced immune responses  so elicited from intestinal- and immune-related cells, but rather instead, they could dampen them. accordingly, we have now provided the first phenotypical description of a spafed pilus operon, and with that furthered the functional understanding of surface piliation for a particular gut-commensalic genre of piliated gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == new lactic acid bacterial strains from traditional mongolian fermented milk products have altered adhesion to porcine gastric mucin depending on the carbon source.
AB  == attachment of lactic acid bacteria to the mucosal surface of the gastrointestinal tract is a major property of probiotics. here, we examined the ability of 21 lactic acid bacterial strains isolated from traditional fermented milk products in mongolia to adhere to porcine gastric mucin in vitro. higher attachment was observed with lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strains 6-8 and 8-1 than with lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (positive control). lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris strain 7-1 adhered to mucin as effectively as did strain gg. heat inactivation decreased the adhesive ability of strains 6-8 and 8-1 but did not affect strain 7-1. the adhesion of strains 6-8, 7-1 and 8-1 was significantly inhibited when the cells were pretreated with periodate and trypsin, indicating that proteinaceous and carbohydrate-like cell surface compounds are involved in the adhesion of these strains. the adhesion of strain 7-1 was affected by the type of carbohydrate present in the growth medium, being higher with fructose than with lactose, galactose or xylose as the carbon source. the sugar content of 7-1 cells grown on various carbohydrates was negatively correlated with its adhesive ability. we provide new probiotic candidate strains and new information  regarding carbohydrate preference that influences lactic acid bacterial adhesion  to mucin.

TI  == co-culture fermentation of peanut-soy milk for the development of a novel functional beverage.
AB  == most of the commercial probiotic products are dairy-based, and the development of non-dairy probiotic products could be an alternative for new functional products. the peanut-soy milk (psm(1)) was inoculated with six different lactic acid bacteria (lab), including probiotic strains and yeasts and fermentation was accomplished for 24h at 37 degrees c and afterwards, another 24h at +/-4 degrees  c. the pediococcus acidilactici (ufla bffcx 27.1), lactococcus lactis (cct 0360), lactobacillus rhamnosus (lr 32) probiotic lab, and the lactobacillus delbrueckii  subsp. bulgaricus (lb 340) yogurt starter culture reached cell concentrations of  about 8.3log cfu/ml during fermentation. however, these strains were not able to  acidify the substrate when inoculated as pure culture. the lactobacillus acidophilus (laca 4) probiotic produced significant amounts of lactic acid (3.35  g/l) and rapidly lowered the ph (4.6). saccharomyces cerevisiae (ufla yffbm 18.03) did not completely consume the available sugars in psm and consequently produced low amounts of ethanol (0.24 g/l). in pure culture, s. cerevisiae (ufla  yffbm 18.03), l. rhamnosus (lr 32), l. acidophilus (laca 4), and p. acidilactici  (ufla bffcx 27.1) promoted the increase of total amino acids (48.02%, 47.32%, 46.21% and, 44.07%, respectively). however, when in co-cultured, the strains consumed the free amino acids favoring their growth, and reaching the population  of 8log cfu/ml in psm. lactic acid production increased, and 12 h was required to reach a ph value of 4.3. in general, the strains were more efficient in the use of available carbohydrates and release of metabolites in co-cultured than in single culture fermentations. an average of 58% and 78% of available carbohydrates was consumed when single and co-cultures were evaluated, respectively. higher lactic acid contents were found in a binary culture of p. acidilactici (ufla bffcx 27.1) and l. acidophilus (laca 4), and by co-culture of  p. acidilactici (ufla bffcx 27.1), l. acidophilus (laca 4) and s. cerevisiae (ufla yffbm 18.03) (9.03 and 8.51 g/l, respectively). the final content of ethanol was 0.03% (v/v) or less, which classified the final beverage as non-alcoholic.

TI  == perinatal outcomes of prenatal probiotic and prebiotic administration: an integrative review.
AB  == the purpose of this integrative review was to identify, critique, and synthesize  the maternal and neonatal evidence on the prenatal use of probiotics and prebiotics to inform perinatal health professionals. a comprehensive literature search resulted in 37 studies of prenatal probiotics and 1 on antepartal prebiotics published from 1990 through 2011 that reported maternal, fetal, and/or neonatal outcomes. the methodologic quality of the studies reviewed was high, although investigators used different probiotic combinations and inconsistently reported perinatal clinical outcomes. the extraction of perinatal outcome variables resulted in identification of 9 maternal and 5 neonatal categories. prenatal probiotics significantly reduced the incidence of bacterial vaginosis, increased colonization with vaginal lactobacillus and intestinal lactobacillus rhamnosus, altered immune markers in serum and breast milk, improved maternal glucose metabolism, and reduced the incidence of gestational diabetes and preeclampsia. antepartally, probiotics were associated with significantly higher  counts of bifidobacterium and lactococcus lactis (healthy intestinal flora) in neonatal stool. prenatal prebiotics significantly increased maternal intestinal bifidobacterium. no adverse events were reported and there was evidence of safety and tolerance of prenatal probiotics and prebiotics in the scientific investigations reviewed. it is recommended that in future investigations of prenatal probiotics researchers explicitly report maternal and neonatal outcomes.

TI  == role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature  search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment  of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase  production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in  vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with  s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between  probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.

TI  == distribution of antimicrobial-resistant lactic acid bacteria in natural cheese in japan.
AB  == to determine and compare the extent of contamination caused by antimicrobial-resistant lactic acid bacteria (lab) in imported and domestic natural cheeses on the japanese market, lab were isolated using deman, rogosa and sharpe (mrs) agar and mrs agar supplemented with six antimicrobials. from 38 imported and 24 japanese cheeses, 409 lab isolates were obtained and their antimicrobial resistance was tested. the percentage of lab resistant to dihydrostreptomycin, erythromycin, and/or oxytetracycline isolated from imported  cheeses (42.1%) was significantly higher than that of lab resistant to dihydrostreptomycin or oxytetracycline from cheeses produced in japan (16.7%; p=0.04). antimicrobial resistance genes were detected in enterococcus faecalis (tetl, tetm, and ermb; tetl and ermb; tetm) e. faecium (tetm), lactococcus lactis (tets), lactobacillus (lb.), casei/paracasei (tetm or tetw), and lb. rhamnosus (ermb) isolated from seven imported cheeses. moreover, these e. faecalis isolates were able to transfer antimicrobial resistance gene(s). although antimicrobial resistance genes were not detected in any lab isolates from japanese cheeses, lb. casei/paracasei and lb. coryniformis isolates from a japanese farm-made cheese were resistant to oxytetracycline (minimal inhibitory concentration [mic], 32 microg/ml). leuconostoc isolates from three japanese farm-made cheeses were also  resistant to dihydrostreptomycin (mic, 32 to >512 microg/ml). in conclusion, the  present study demonstrated contamination with antimicrobial-resistant lab in imported and japanese farm-made cheeses on the japanese market, but not in japanese commercial cheeses.

TI  == using recombinant lactococci as an approach to dissect the immunomodulating capacity of surface piliation in probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gg.
AB  == primarily arising from their well understood beneficial health effects, many lactobacilli strains are considered good candidates for use as probiotics in humans and animals. lactobacillar probiosis can itself be best typified by the lactobacillus rhamnosus gg strain, which, with its well-documented clinical benefits, has emerged as one of the most widely used probiotics in the food and health-supplement industries. even so, many facets of its molecular mechanisms and limitations as a beneficial commensal bacterium still remain to be thoroughly explored and dissected. because l. rhamnosus gg is one of only a few such strains exhibiting surface piliation (called spacba), we sought to examine whether this particular type of cell-surface appendage has a discernible immunomodulating capacity and is able to trigger targeted responses in human immune-related cells. thus, presented herein for this study, we recombinantly engineered lactococcus lactis to produce native (and pilin-deleted) spacba pili that were assembled in a structurally authentic form and anchored to the cell surface, and which had retained mucus-binding functionality. by using these recombinant lactococcal constructs, we were able to demonstrate that the spacba pilus can be a contributory factor in the activation of toll-like receptor 2-dependent signaling in hek cells as well as in the modulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine  (tnf-alpha, il-6, il-10, and il-12) production in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. from these data, we suggest that the recombinant-expressed and surface-anchored spacba pilus, given its projected functioning in the gut environment, might be viewed as a new microbe-associated molecular pattern (mamp)-like modulator of innate immunity. accordingly, our study has brought some new insight to the molecular immunogenicity of the spacba pilus, thus opening the way to a better understanding of its possible role in the multifaceted nature of  l. rhamnosus gg probiosis within the human gut.

TI  == utilization of lactic acid bacterial genes in synechocystis sp. pcc 6803 in the production of lactic acid.
AB  == metabolic pathway engineering of cyanobacteria for the production of industrially important chemicals from atmospheric co2 has generated interest recently. here, we engineered synechocystis sp. pcc 6803 to produce lactic acid using a lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) gene from various lactic acid-producing bacteria, lactococcus lactis (ldhb and ldhx), lactobacillus plantarum (ldhl and ldh), and lactobacillus rhamnosus (ldhl). the lactic acid was secreted outside the cell using a transporter (lldp) gene from l. plantarum. expression of each ldh in synechocystis sp. pcc6803 was ascertained by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. five transformants led to the production of l-lactic acid. co-expression of lldp with ldhb from l. plantarum or ldhl from l. rhamnosus led to the secretion of lactic acid into the medium at concentration of 0.17 +/- 0.02 or 0.14 +/- 0.02 mm after 18 d of cultivation.

TI  == stable integration and expression of heterologous genes in several lactobacilli using an integration vector constructed from the integrase and attp sequences of  phage phiat3 isolated from lactobacillus casei atcc 393.
AB  == an integration vector capable of stably integrating and maintaining in the chromosomes of several lactobacilli over hundreds of generations has been constructed. the major integration machinery used is based on the phiat3 integrase (int) and attp sequences determined previously. a novel core sequence located at the 3' end of the trna(leu) gene is identified in lactobacillus fermentum atcc 14931 as the integration target by the integration vector though most of such sequences found in other lactobacilli are similar to that determined previously. due to the lack of an appropriate attb site in lactococcus lactis mg1363, the integration vector is found to be unable to integrate into the chromosome of the strain. however, such integration can be successfully restored  by cotransforming the integration vector with a replicative one harboring both attb and erythromycin resistance sequences into the strain. furthermore, the integration vector constructed carries a promoter region of plact from the chromosome of lactobacillus rhamnosus tcell-1 which is used to express green fluorescence and luminance protein genes in the lactobacilli studied.

TI  == interaction of campylobacter spp. and human probiotics in chicken intestinal mucus.
AB  == campylobacter is the most common cause of bacterial food-borne diarrhoeal disease throughout the world. the principal risk of human contamination is handling and consumption of contaminated poultry meat. to colonize poultry, campylobacter adheres to and persists in the mucus layer that covers the intestinal epithelium. inhibiting adhesion to the mucus could prevent colonization of the intestine. the aim of this study was to investigate in vitro the protective effect of defined commercial human probiotic strains on the adhesion of campylobacter spp. to chicken intestinal mucus, in a search for alternatives to antibiotics to control  this food-borne pathogen. the probiotic strains lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js and a starter culture strain lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis adhered well to chicken intestinal mucus and were  able to reduce the binding of campylobacter spp. when the mucus was colonized with the probiotic strain before contacting the pathogen. human-intended probiotics could be useful as prophylactics in poultry feeding for controlling campylobacter spp. colonization.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of a spontaneous cocoa bean fermentation metagenome reveals new insights into its bacterial and fungal community diversity.
AB  == this is the first report on the phylogenetic analysis of the community diversity  of a single spontaneous cocoa bean box fermentation sample through a metagenomic  approach involving 454 pyrosequencing. several sequence-based and composition-based taxonomic profiling tools were used and evaluated to avoid software-dependent results and their outcome was validated by comparison with previously obtained culture-dependent and culture-independent data. overall, this approach revealed a wider bacterial (mainly gamma-proteobacteria) and fungal diversity than previously found. further, the use of a combination of different classification methods, in a software-independent way, helped to understand the actual composition of the microbial ecosystem under study. in addition, bacteriophage-related sequences were found. the bacterial diversity depended partially on the methods used, as composition-based methods predicted a wider diversity than sequence-based methods, and as classification methods based solely on phylogenetic marker genes predicted a more restricted diversity compared with  methods that took all reads into account. the metagenomic sequencing analysis identified hanseniaspora uvarum, hanseniaspora opuntiae, saccharomyces cerevisiae, lactobacillus fermentum, and acetobacter pasteurianus as the prevailing species. also, the presence of occasional members of the cocoa bean fermentation process was revealed (such as erwinia tasmaniensis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and oenococcus oeni). furthermore, the sequence reads  associated with viral communities were of a restricted diversity, dominated by myoviridae and siphoviridae, and reflecting lactobacillus as the dominant host. to conclude, an accurate overview of all members of a cocoa bean fermentation process sample was revealed, indicating the superiority of metagenomic sequencing over previously used techniques.

TI  == the spatial distribution of bacteria in grana-cheese during ripening.
AB  == the microbial composition and its spatial distribution of grana trentino, a hard  parmesan-like cheese, was determined, from vat milk to cheese. after cutting along the vertical axis of the cheese wheels, three layers were sampled diagonally across the cheese: under the cheese rind, an intermediate section and  the cheese core. after two different ripening periods (9 and 18 months), the cheese samples were analysed using traditional culture dependent and culture independent methods. milk samples were dominated by mesophilic and psychrophilic  bacterial counts. thermophilic bacteria (lactobacillus helveticus) were found in  high amounts in cooked whey and natural whey starter cultures. after 9 months of  ripening, lactic acid bacteria (lab) counts were higher than those after 18 months. furthermore, the lab numbers in the cheese core was lower than those under the rind or in the intermediate section. the main lab species isolated from milk (lactococcus lactis, pediococcus pentosaceus, streptococcus uberis and lactococcus garvieae) were not found in the corresponding cheeses. some differences were observed in the species composition among the three cheese sections. microbiota under the rind and in the intermediate section was similar and dominated by lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the core, after 18 months of ripening, was characterized by a total absence of lab. in each sample, all lab were genotypically grouped and the different biotypes were subjected to several technological tests indicating that some non-starter lab (nslab) displayed technological features that are favorable for the production of grana trentino cheese.

AB  == the present work was aimed at characterizing 12 strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) to obtain improved potential starter or probiotic cultures that could be used for making dairy products from ewe's milk and cow's milk. eight strains with antimicrobial properties, isolated from ewe's milk and from cheese made from ewe's and/or cow's milk, were studied. they were identified as enterococcus faecalis (five strains), lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (one strain of each species). additionally, four strains were obtained from the american type culture collection: lactobacillus casei 393 (isolated from cheese), l. lactis subsp. lactis 11454 (origin nonspecified and a producer of nisin), and two strains isolated from human feces (l. paracasei subsp. paracasei 27092 and lactobacillus  rhamnosus 53103, antibacterial agent producer). all e. faecalis strains showed at least one virulence factor (either hemolysin or gelatinase), which emphasizes the importance of these studies in this species. both l. lactis strains and most lactobacillus spp. were good acidifiers in ewe's milk and cow's milk at 30 degrees c. high beta-galactosidase activity, as well as aminopeptidase activities that favor the development of desirable flavors in cheese, were detected in all lactobacillus spp. strains. furthermore, l. rhamnosus atcc 53103 showed alpha-fucosidase activity (thought to help colonization of the intestine) and lack of alpha-glucosidase activity (a trait considered positive for diabetic and  obese humans). this last enzymatic activity was also lacking in l. lactis atcc 11454. l. mesenteroides was the only strain d(2)-lactic acid producer. the selection of any particular strain for probiotic or dairy cultures should be performed according to the technological and/or functional abilities needed.

TI  == diversity and dynamics of bacterial populations during spontaneous sorghum fermentations used to produce ting, a south african food.
AB  == ting is a spontaneously fermented sorghum food that is popular for its sour taste and unique flavour. insight of the microbial diversity and population dynamics during sorghum fermentations is an essential component of the development of starter cultures for commercial production of ting. in this study, bacterial populations associated with spontaneous sorghum fermentations were examined using a culture-independent strategy based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequence analysis of v3-16s rrna gene amplicons, and a culture-dependent strategy using conventional isolation based on culturing followed by 16s rrna and/or phes gene sequence analysis. the entire fermentation process was monitored over a 54 h period and two phases were observed with respect to ph evolution and  microbial succession. the first phase of the process (0-6h) was characterized by  relatively high ph conditions and the presence of enterococcus mundtii, albeit that this species was only detected with the culture-dependent approach. the second phase of the fermentation process (12-54 h) was characterized by increased acidity and the predominance of a broader range of lactic acid bacteria, including lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, weissella cibaria, enterococcus faecalis, and a close relative of lactobacillus curvatus, as well as some members of the enterobacteriaceae family. the lb. curvatus-like species was only detected with pcr-dgge, while the majority of the other species was only detected using the culture-dependent approach. these findings highlighted the fact that a combination of both approaches was essential in revealing the microbial diversity and dynamics during spontaneous sorghum fermentations.

TI  == pecorino crotonese cheese: study of bacterial population and flavour compounds.
AB  == the diversity and dynamics of the dominant bacterial population during the manufacture and the ripening of two artisanal pecorino crotonese cheeses, provided by different farms, were investigated by the combination of culture-dependent and -independent approaches. three hundred and thirty-three strains were isolated from selective culture media, clustered using restriction fragment length polymorphism and were identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing. the results indicate a decrease in biodiversity during ripening, revealing the presence of lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus species in the curd and in aged cheese samples and the occurrence of several lactobacilli throughout  cheese ripening, with the dominance of lactobacillus rhamnosus species. bacterial dynamics determined by denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis provided a more precise description of the distribution of bacteria, highlighting differences in  the bacterial community among cheese samples, and allowed to detect lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus buchneri and leuconostoc mesenteroides species, which were not isolated. moreover, the concentration of flavour compounds produced throughout cheese ripening was investigated and related to lactic acid bacteria presence. fifty-seven compounds were identified in the volatile fraction of pecorino crotonese cheeses by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. esters, alcohols and free fatty acids were the most abundant compounds, while aldehydes and hydrocarbons were present at low levels.

TI  == probiotic table olives: microbial populations adhering on olive surface in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in an industrial plant.
AB  == this study reports the dynamics of microbial populations adhering on the surface  of debittered green olives cv. bella di cerignola in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in different brining conditions (4% and 8% (w/v) nacl) at room temperature and 4 degrees c. the probiotic strain successfully colonized the olive surface dominating the natural  lab population and decreasing the ph of brines to <or=5.0 after 30 days until the end of fermentation. the dynamics of microbial populations associated with olive  surface and belonging to the different groups indicated that inoculated olives held at room temperature did not host enterobacteriaceae at the end of fermentation. yeast populations were present in a low number (<or=log(10) 5.7 cfu/g) throughout the process. a considerable genetic diversity of lab species colonizing the olive surface was found mainly in inoculated set brined in 8% nacl, as indicated by the shannon diversity index calculated for each set. generally, strains of lactobacillus coryniformis, l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l.  pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. brevis, l. mali, l. vaccinostercus, l.casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuc. pseudomesenteroides, lactococcus lactis, weissella paramesenteroides, w. cibaria, enterococcus casseliflavus group and e.  italicus were identified during the whole process. in particular, l. pentosus was the most frequently isolated species and it showed a high strain diversity throughout fermentation in all processes except for the one held at 4 degrees c.  also a notable incidence of leuc. mesenteroides on olives was highlighted in this study during all fermentation. results indicated that the human strain l. paracasei impc2.1 can be considered an example of a strain used in the dual role  of starter and probiotic culture which allowed the control of fermentation processes and the realization of a final probiotic product with functional appeal.

TI  == development of a pcr assay for the strain-specific identification of probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1.
AB  == recent investigations clearly indicate that the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 can be incorporated into vegetables to obtain innovative probiotic foods whose marketing has been authorized by the italian ministry of health. in this study, strain impc2.1 was characterized at a molecular level in order to define its taxonomic position and to develop a pcr test for strain-specific identification. molecular methods, such as 16s rrna gene sequencing and multiplex pcr, have provided evidence that strain impc2.1 indeed belongs to the l. paracasei species. in addition, a cluster analysis of fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (f-aflp) data strongly indicated that strain impc2.1 and nine other l. paracasei strains (including strain atcc 334) belong to the same species and are definitely differentiated from the type strain l. casei atcc 393. the f-aflp technique was also used to identify a strain-specific dna fragment of l. paracasei impc2.1 - encoding an amino acid sequence similar to a glycosyltransferase of probiotic strain lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 - which enabled us to develop a rapid pcr test for  strain-specific identification. the strain-specificity of the pcr test was assessed by comparison with a total of 73 bacterial strains mainly isolated from  vegetable products that did not produce any amplified fragment. these strains belonged to the l. paracasei species, to 6 additional species of lactobacillus and to weissella cibaria, w. confusa, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides and pediococcus pentosaceus. a method similar to the one used in this study can be adopted to develop easy, rapid detection techniques for monitoring other bacteria in complex microbiota.

TI  == the feasibility of serving liquid yoghurt supplemented with probiotic bacteria, lactobacillus rhamnosus lb 21, and lactococcus lactis l1a--a pilot study among old people with dementia in a residential care facility.
AB  == background: constipation and body weight loss are prevalent among old people. treatment with different species of lactic acid bacteria has been suggested for various forms of gastrointestinal disorders. objective, participants and intervention: this pilot study was performed to assess the feasibility of administering and consuming a drinkable yoghurt containing lactobacillus rhamnosus lb 21 and lactococcus l1a, and to evaluate the influence on bowel movements and body weight in 15 people with dementia, aged 65-95 years in residential care facility. design: a drinkable yoghurt (verum drickyoghurt) with  added bacteria was served daily for 6 months in conjunction with ordinary food intake. body weight, bowel movement frequency and consistency, food and fluid intake and time spent in various activities were recorded for two weeks pre-intervention, and 3 times during the follow-up period. result: this study showed that the yoghurt was easy to serve, with few side effects for the participants and that the various recording forms and diaries were easy for the staff to complete. the extra intake of yoghurt did not have any detectable beneficial effect on bowel movements. the overnight fast was almost 15 hours per  day. body weight decreased by 0.65 kg/month (95% confidence interval. 0.27-0.97). conclusions: the present study design was feasible in this group of old people with dementia. the absence of any detectable effect of the supplement on constipation, but rather a considerable loss in body weight, indicate that further research is needed in a large randomised controlled trial, if associations between dementia, constipation and energy balance are to be understood.

TI  == heme and menaquinone induced electron transport in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == background: for some lactic acid bacteria higher biomass production as a result of aerobic respiration has been reported upon supplementation with heme and menaquinone. in this report, we have studied a large number of species among lactic acid bacteria for the existence of this trait. results: heme- (and menaquinone) stimulated aerobic growth was observed for several species and genera of lactic acid bacteria. these include lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacilllus brevis, lactobacillus paralimentarius, streptococcus entericus and lactococcus garviae. the increased biomass production without further acidification, which are respiration associated traits, are suitable for high-throughput screening as demonstrated by the screening of 8000 lactococcus lactis insertion mutants. respiration-negative insertion-mutants were found with noxa, bd-type cytochrome and menaquinol biosynthesis gene-disruptions. phenotypic screening and in silico genome analysis suggest that respiration can be considered characteristic for certain species. conclusion: we propose that the cyd-genes were present in the common ancestor of lactic acid bacteria, and that multiple gene-loss events best explains the observed distribution of these genes  among the species.

TI  == a method for the identification of proteins secreted by lactic acid bacteria grown in complex media.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are known for their special nutritional requirements,  being usually cultured in complex media to achieve optimal growth. in this paper, a protocol based on trichloroacetic acid precipitation of peptides and proteins is presented. the method has been tested on four probiotic lab strains grown in de man rogosa sharpe (mrs) broth, a complex medium that is often used for the culture of such bacteria. this protocol allowed the detection of 19 proteins after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 10 of them being successfully identified by tandem ms. thereafter, the 10 were found to be secreted or surface associated by bioinformatic means. in conclusion, this work supplies a method for the identification of proteins secreted by lab, allowing discrimination between the proteins present in the mrs and those produced by probiotic lab.

TI  == characterization of a small erythromycin resistance plasmid plfe1 from the food-isolate lactobacillus plantarum m345.
AB  == this paper reports the complete 4031 bp nucleotide sequence of the small erythromycin resistance plasmid plfe1 isolated from the raw-milk cheese isolate lactobacillus plantarum m345. analysis of the sequence revealed the coding regions for the erythromycin resistance determinant erm(b). a replication initiation protein repb was identified belonging to the repb proteins of the pmv158 family of rolling-circle replicating plasmids. the transcriptional repressor protein copg and a small counter transcribed rna, two elements typically involved in replication control within this family were also found. a putative replication initiation site including a single-strand origin (sso) -like region succeeded by a characteristic pmv158 family double-strand origin (dso) was located upstream of the replication region. an open reading frame following a typical origin of transfer (orit) site and coding for a putative truncated mobilization (mob) protein with a size of 83 aa was detected. the product of the  putative mob gene showed large similarity to the n-terminal region of the pmv158  family of pre/mob proteins, but was much smaller than other proteins of this family. we therefore suggest that the mob function in plfe1 is supplied in trans  from another plasmid present in l. plantarum m345.filter-mating experiments showed that plfe1 has a broad host-range with transconjugants obtained from lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, listeria innocua, the opportunistic  pathogen enterococcus faecalis and the pathogen listeria monocytogenes.

TI  == volatile sulfur compounds produced by probiotic bacteria in the presence of cysteine or methionine.
AB  == aims: to investigate the abilities of various probiotic bacteria to produce volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) relevant to food flavour and aroma. methods and  results: probiotic strains (lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, lactobacillus plantarum 299v, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus reuteri atcc55730 and l. reuteri br11), lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc4797, l. plantarum atcc14917 and  lactococcus lactis mg1363 were incubated with either cysteine or methionine. volatile compounds were captured, identified and quantified using a sensitive solid-phase microextraction (spme) technique combined with gas chromatography coupled to a pulsed flame photometric detector (spme/gc/pfpd). several vscs were  identified including h(2)s, methanethiol, dimethyldisulfide and dimethyltrisulfide. the vsc profiles varied substantially for different strains of l. plantarum and l. reuteri and it was found that l. reuteri atcc55730 and l.  lactis mg1363 produced the lowest levels of vscs (p < 0.05). levels of vscs generated by bacteria were found to be equivalent to, or higher than, that found  in commercial cheeses. conclusions: several probiotic strains are able to generate considerable levels of vscs and substantial variations in vsc generating potential exists between different strains from the same species. significance and importance of the study: this study demonstrates that probiotic bacteria are  able to efficiently generate important flavour and aroma compounds and therefore  has implications for the development of probiotic containing foods.

TI  == characterization and antimicrobial spectrum of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional bulgarian dairy products.
AB  == aims: to isolate bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria (lab) with high wide  spectrum antibacterial activity and to characterize their inhibitory peptides. method and results: seven lab strains [lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus (pc5),  lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (bb18), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis  (bcm5, bk15), enterococcus faecium (mh3), lactobacillus plantarum (br12), lactobacillus casei ssp. casei (bcz2)], isolated from authentic bulgarian dairy products were capable of producing bacteriocins, inhibiting the widest range of pathogenic bacteria. the bacteriocins were resistant to heating at 121 degrees c  for 15 min, stable at ph 2-10, sensitive to protease, insensitive to alpha-amylase and lipase. two of bacteriocins produced by lact. bulgaricus bb18 (bulgaricin bb18) and e. faecium mh3 (enterocin mh3) were purified and the molecular masses were determined. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of bulgaricin bb18 did not show strong homology to other known bacteriocins. conclusions: lactobacillus bulgaricus bb18 and e. faecium mh3 produce two novel bacteriocins highly similar to the pediocin-like nonlantibiotics. significance and impact of the study: the two bacteriocins are potential antimicrobial agents  and, in conjunction with their producers, may have use in applications to contribute a positive effect on the balance of intestinal microflora. furthermore, bulgaricin bb18 strongly inhibits helicobacter pylori.

TI  == effect of specific colostral antibodies and selected lactobacilli on the adhesion of helicobacter pylori on ags cells and the helicobacter-induced il-8 production.
AB  == helicobacter pylori infection is the most common cause of gastritis, gastric ulcer and adenocarcinoma. it has proven difficult to cure because of its capability to develop strains resistant to antibiotics. the effect of three strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and bovine colostral preparations on the adhesion of h. pylori nctc 11637 on gastric adenocarcinoma (ags) cells and on the interleukin (il)-8 production was studied. before infection, h. pylori were pretreated with lactobacillus plantarum mlbpl1, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactococcus lactis, or with a colostral preparation with or without specific h. pylori antibodies. the relative number of h. pylori adhered on ags cells was determined by urease test. il-8 produced by the cells was studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. colostral preparations with and without specific antibodies reduced the adhesion of h. pylori on ags cells in a dose-dependent manner. live lab at a concentration of 10(10) cfu/ml reduced the adhesion by approximately 50% (p < 0.05). after the infection of ags cells by h.  pylori, the il-8 level rose up to about 10-fold (5500 +/- 1600 pg/ml). pretreatment of h. pylori with colostral preparations or high concentrations of lab prevented this il-8 rise. similar effect was seen with live and heat-killed lab, the live lab being more effective. heat-killed lab at a concentration of 10(10) cfu/ml rose the il-8 level of non-infected cells significantly. suppression of il-8 production by lab or colostral products could have a suppressive effect on inflammation in helicobacter infection.

TI  == probiotic bacteria affect the composition of salivary pellicle and streptococcal  adhesion in vitro.
AB  == introduction: the use of probiotic bacteria is increasing worldwide and at least  some of them can transiently colonize the oral cavity. several studies have shown that probiotic bacteria, which are often thought of in relation only to intestinal health, can also affect the oral ecology, but the mechanisms for this  are largely unknown. the aim of this study was to investigate in vitro if the probiotic bacteria used in commercial products affect the protein composition of  the salivary pellicle and the adherence of other oral bacteria. methods: salivary pellicle on hydroxyapatite and the adhesion of two oral streptococci, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus gordonii, were used as a model. results: probiotic bacteria that bound to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite reduced the adhesion of s. mutans but the inhibitory effect on the adherence of s. gordonii was weaker. salivary pellicle protein composition was modified by all the strains tested. the modifications in the pellicle affected the adherence of s. mutans but not of s. gordonii. two of the proteins missing from the pellicles made of saliva-treated with the probiotic bacteria were identified as salivary agglutinin gp340 and salivary peroxidase. all bacterial strains bound salivary agglutinin gp340. the ability of the probiotic bacteria to degrade peroxidase was demonstrated with purified bovine lactoperoxidase and two of the probiotic strains. conclusion: this in vitro study showed that probiotic strains used in commercial products may affect the oral ecology by specifically preventing the adherence of other bacteria and by modifying the protein composition of the salivary pellicle.

TI  == genome sequence and characteristics of lrm1, a prophage from industrial lactobacillus rhamnosus strain m1.
AB  == prophage lrm1 was induced with mitomycin c from an industrial lactobacillus rhamnosus starter culture, m1. electron microscopy of the lysate revealed relatively few intact bacteriophage particles among empty heads and disassociated tails. the defective siphoviridae phage had an isometric head of approximately 55 nm and noncontractile tail of about 275 nm with a small baseplate. in repeated attempts, the prophage could not be cured from l. rhamnosus m1, nor could a sensitive host be identified. sequencing of the phage lrm1 dna revealed a genome  of 39,989 bp and a g+c content of 45.5%. a similar genomic organization and mosaic pattern of identities align lrm1 among the closely related lactobacillus casei temperate phages a2, phiat3, and lcai and with l. rhamnosus virulent phage  lu-nu. of the 54 open reading frames (orfs) identified, all but 8 shared homology with other phages of this group. five unknown orfs were identified that had no homologies in the databases nor predicted functions. notably, lrm1 encodes a putative endonuclease and a putative dna methylase with homology to a methylase in lactococcus lactis phage tuc2009. possibly, the dna methylase, endonuclease, or other lrm1 genes provide a function crucial to l. rhamnosus m1 survival, resulting in the stability of the defective prophage in its lysogenic state. the  presence of a defective prophage in an industrial strain could provide superinfection immunity to the host but could also contribute dna in recombination events to produce new phages potentially infective for the host strain in a large-scale fermentation environment.

TI  == enhancement of functional characteristics of mixed lactic culture producing nisin z and exopolysaccharides during continuous prefermentation of milk with immobilized cells.
AB  == antagonistic phenomena between strains often occur in mixed cultures containing a bacteriocinogenic strain. a nisin z producer (lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis biovar. diacetylactis ul719) and 2 nisin-sensitive strains for acidification (lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris atcc19257) and exopolysaccharide (eps) production (lactobacillus rhamnosus rw-9595m) were immobilized separately in gel  beads and used to continuously preferment milk at different temperatures, with ph controlled at 6.0 by fresh milk addition. the process showed high volumetric productivity, with an increase from 8.0 to 12.5 l of prefermented milk per liter  of reactor volume and hour as the temperature was increased from 27 to 35 degrees c. lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis biovar. diacetylactis ul719 counts in prefermented and fermented (22-h batch fermentation) milks were stable during 3 wk of continuous fermentation (8.1 +/- 0.1 and 8.9 +/- 0.2 log cfu/ml, respectively). the l. lactis ssp. cremoris population (estimated with real-time quantitative pcr) decreased rapidly during the first week of continuous culture to approximately 4.5 log cfu/ml and remained constant afterward. lactobacillus rhamnosus counts in prefermented and fermented milks significantly increased with prefermentation time, with no temperature effect. nisin z reached high titers in  fermented milks (from 177 to 363 iu/ml), with eps concentration in the range from 43 to 178 mg/l. immobilization and continuous culture led to important physiological changes, with lb. rhamnosus becoming much more tolerant to nisin z, and lb. rhamnosus and l. lactis ssp. lactis biovar. diacetylactis ul719 exhibiting large increases in milk acidification capacity. our data showed that continuous milk prefermentation with immobilized cells can stimulate the acidification activity of low-acidifying strains and produce fermented milks with improved and controlled functional properties.

TI  == media and process parameters affecting the growth, strain ratios and specific acidifying activities of a mixed lactic starter containing aroma-producing and probiotic strains.
AB  == aims: the effects of medium-composition and fermentation parameters on the properties of mixed mesophilic starters were studied. the starter was composed of lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (l. lactis), lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris (l.  cremoris), lactobacillus rhamnosus (lact. rhamnosus) and leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris (leuc. cremoris). methods and results: the media used were reconstituted skim milk (rsm), and whey-based media with either citrate or phosphate buffers. the fermentation parameters were incubation temperature (22 degrees c or 32 degrees c), no ph control, and ph control in ph zones of either ph 6.0-5.8 or ph 6.0-5.2. the starter properties were strain ratio, specific acidifying activity (saa), total population, residual carbohydrates and organic acids produced. the growth of l. lactis was favoured under ph control in whey-based media. high concentrations of lact. rhamnosus were favoured in whey-based media prepared at 32 degrees c. the highest contents of leuc. cremoris were obtained in starters prepared in rsm at 22 degrees c without ph control. starters prepared under ph control gave the highest populations and made it possible for significantly lower inoculation rates (ir) to be used to carry out subsequent milk fermentations. however, the saa of starters prepared under ph control were lower than the saa of starters grown without any ph control. conclusions: none of the conditions enabled the strain ratio at inoculation to be maintained. the data show that it is possible to prepare a mesophilic starter that has a significant probiotic lact. rhamnosus content; this starter could be used in the preparation of probiotic-containing cheeses or in leuc. cremoris for  aroma production in fermented milks. significance and impact of the study: this study provides data on what should be expected with respect to strain ratios and  ir if cheesemakers decide to shift their aroma-producing starter production method from the traditional 'milk-based without ph control' method to whey-based  media used with ph-zone control strategies.

TI  == racemization of l-lactic acid in ph-swing open fermentation of kitchen refuse by  selective proliferation of lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == we have shown that stable lactic acid fermentation of model kitchen refuse occurs with intermittent ph adjustment under nonsterilized conditions. nonetheless, the  optical activity of the accumulated lactic acid was low, which is disadvantageous for the production of high-quality poly-l-lactic acid. here, we attempt to increase optical purity by introducing l-lactic acid-producing strains under nonsterilized conditions and demonstrate that the inoculation of lactobacillus rhamnosus or lactococcus lactis, both of which are l-lactic acid producers, is partially effective in the early fermentation stage, but does not improve the final optical purity of the accumulated lactic acid. we confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization using group-specific and species-specific 16s rdna probes that this is due to the selective proliferation of naturally existing l. plantarum. l. plantarum ky-1, which is isolated from model kitchen refuse, showing lactic acid racemase activity, as well as d-lactate dehydrogenase activity, in its membrane fraction. we conclude that racemase activity associated with l. plantarum is the main cause of decreased optical purity in the accumulated lactic acid.

TI  == staphylococcus aureus adheres to human intestinal mucus but can be displaced by certain lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == there is increasing evidence that staphylococcus aureus may colonize the intestinal tract, especially among hospitalized patients. as staph. aureus has been found to be associated with certain gastrointestinal diseases, it has become important to study whether this bacterium can colonize the intestinal tract and if so, whether it is possible to prevent colonization. adhesion is the first step in colonization; this study shows that staph. aureus adheres to mucus from resected human intestinal tissue. certain lactic acid bacteria (lab), mainly commercial probiotics, were able to reduce adhesion and viability of adherent staph. aureus. in displacement assays the amount of adherent staph. aureus in human intestinal mucus was reduced 39-44% by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii. moreover, adherent lactobacillus reuteri, lc. lactis and p. freudenreichii reduced viability of adherent staph. aureus by 27-36%, depending on the strain, after 2 h incubation. this was probably due to the production of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide and possibly in the case of l. reuteri to the production of reuterin. this study shows for the first time that staph. aureus can adhere to human intestinal mucus and adherent bacteria can be displaced and killed by certain lab strains via in situ production of antimicrobial substances.

AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

TI  == quantification by real-time pcr of lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris in milk fermented by a mixed culture.
AB  == during cheese making, interactions between different strains of lactic acid bacteria play an important role. however, few methods are available to specifically determine each bacterial population in mixed cultures, in particular for strains of the same species. the aim of this study was to develop a real-time pcr quantification method to monitor the population of lactococcus cremoris atcc  19257 in mixed culture with lactobacillus rhamnosus rw-9595m and the bacteriocin-producing microorganism lc. diacetylactis ul719. the specificity of the two primers 68fca33 and 16sr308 used to amplify a 240-bp fragment of dna from lc. cremoris was demonstrated by conventional pcr. using these primers for real-time pcr, the detection limit was 2 cfu/reaction or 200 cfu of lc. cremoris  atcc 19257 per millilitre of mixed culture in milk. in pure culture batch fermentation, good correlation was obtained between real-time pcr and the conventional plating method for monitoring lc. cremoris growth. in mixed culture  batch fermentation, lb. rhamnosus and lc. cremoris decreased due to nisin z production by lc. diacetylactis. the decrease of the lc. cremoris cell population detected by real-time pcr was not possible to observe by the plate count method in the presence of a lc. diacetylactis population that was 1 log higher.

TI  == identification and characterization of the novel lysm domain-containing surface protein sep from lactobacillus fermentum br11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in lactobacillus and lactococcus.
AB  == examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of lactobacillus fermentum br11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kda  protein termed sep. the amino-terminal sequence of sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of lactobacillus reuteri, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and lactobacillus plantarum. the carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) surface proteins of lactobacillus gasseri and  lactobacillus johnsonii. the mature amino terminus of sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain, thereby making it distinct from apf proteins.  we have identified a common motif within lysm domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding yg motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in l. fermentum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactococcus lactis mg1363. modified sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and l. lactis hosts. sep as well as the previously described surface protein bspa were used to express and secrete in l.  fermentum or l. rhamnosus a fragment of human e-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for listeria monocytogenes. this study demonstrates that sep has  potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.

AB  == the metabolism of amino acids by 22 starter and 49 non-starter lactic acid bacteria (lab) was studied in a system consisting of amino acids and non-growing  cells without added amino acceptors such as alpha-ketoglutarate. there were significant inter- and intra-species differences in the metabolism of amino acids. some amino acids such as alanine, arginine, aspartate, serine and branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine) were utilised, whereas other amino acids such as glycine, ornithine and citrulline were produced. alanine and aspartate were utilised by some lab and accumulated during  the incubation of other lab. arginine was degraded not only by lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (the lactococcal subspecies known to catabolise arginine), but also by pediococci, heterofermentative lactobacilli (lactobacillus brevis and lb. fermentum) and some unidentified homofermentative lactobacilli. serine was utilised predominantly by homofermentative lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei, lb. rhamnosus and lb. plantarum. of the lab studied, lb. brevis and lb. fermentum were the most metabolically active, utilising alanine, arginine, aspartate, glutamate and branched-chain amino acids. leuconostocs were the least metabolically active, showing little potential to metabolise amino acids. the formation of ammonia and acetate from amino acid metabolism varied both between species and between strains within species. these findings suggest that the potential of lab for amino acid metabolism via non-transaminating reactions and endogenous transamination will impact both on the physiology of lab and on cheese ripening, especially when transamination is rate-limiting in the absence of an exogenous amino acceptor such as alpha-ketoglutarate.

TI  == inhibition of staphylococcus aureus by the commensal bacteria of human milk.
AB  == aims: to study the bacterial diversity in expressed human milk with a focus on detecting bacteria with an antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus,  known as a causative agent of maternal breast infections and neonatal infections. methods and results: random isolates (n = 509) were collected from breast milk samples (n = 40) of healthy lactating women, genotypically identified, and tested for antimicrobial activity against staph. aureus. commensal staphylococci (64%) and oral streptococci (30%), with staph. epidermidis, strep. salivarius, and strep. mitis as the most frequent isolates, were the predominant bacterial species in breast milk. one-fifth of staph. epidermidis and half of strep. salivarius isolates suppressed growth of staph. aureus. enterococci (ent. faecalis), isolated from 7.5% of samples, and lactic acid bacteria (lab) (lactobacillus rhamnosus, lact. crispatus, lactococcus lactis, leuconoctoc mesenteroides), isolated from 12.5% of samples, were also effective against staph. aureus. one l. lactis isolate was shown to produce nisin, a bacteriocin used in food industry to prevent bacterial pathogens and spoilage. conclusions: expressed breast milk contains commensal bacteria, which inhibit staph. aureus. significance and impact of the study: the strains inhibitory against the pathogen staph. aureus have potential use as bacteriotherapeutic agents in preventing neonatal and maternal breast infections caused by this bacterium.

TI  == influence of the oral administration of lactic acid bacteria on iga producing cells associated to bronchus.
AB  == intestinal, respiratory and genitourinary mucosal surfaces are the most important routes of entry for microbial pathogens. the stimulus of the mucosal immunity is  not easy because the trigger keys for the activation do not follow the ones of the systemic immune response. in previous works we have demonstrated that some lactic acid bacteria (lab), when orally administered, can induce an enhance of the gut immune response. taking into account the concept of a common mucosal response, we studied the effect of orally administered mice with lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactococcus lactis on the iga secreting cells associated to bronchus. as shown before, oral immunostimulation with lab induced an increase of the iga* cells at intestinal level by a dose depending effect. in this study it is also showed that the lab assayed, with exception of l. acidophilus, were able to enhance iga+ cells at bronchial level,  being also this effect dose dependent. the increment induced by some lab in the number of iga+ cells on the mucosa surface of the lower respiratory tract may be  very important to prevent bronchus diseases.

TI  == identification and characterization of lactobacillus helveticus pepo2, an endopeptidase with post-proline specificity.
AB  == a post-proline endopeptidase (pepo2) was detected in cell extracts from a genomic library of lactobacillus helveticus cnrz32 by using the synthetic substrate n-acetyl-beta-casein-(f203-209)-rho-nitroanilide in a coupled reaction with aminopeptidase n. isolates with activity for this substrate contained plasmids with visually indistinguishable restriction profiles. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a 1,947-bp open reading frame, designated pepo2, encoding a putative 71.4-kda protein. analysis of the predicted peptide sequence revealed that l. helveticus pepo2 contained the zinc-dependent metalloprotease motif hexxh and exhibited levels of amino acid sequence similarity of 72, 61, 59, and 53% to  l. helveticus pepo, lactococcus lactis pepo2, l. lactis pepo, and lactobacillus rhamnosus pepo, respectively. northern hybridization results indicated that the transcript containing pepo2 was monocistronic. despite the high degrees of amino  acid similarity to pepo proteins from other lactic acid bacteria, the specificity of the l. helveticus pepo2 for post-proline bonds distinguishes it from other pepo-type endopeptidases characterized to date. the specificity for post-proline  bonds also suggests that this enzyme may play a central role in the hydrolysis of casein-derived bitter peptides, such as beta-casein(f193-209).

TI  == food-grade host/vector expression system for lactobacillus casei based on complementation of plasmid-associated phospho-beta-galactosidase gene lacg.
AB  == a new food-grade host/vector system for lactobacillus casei based on lactose selection was constructed. the wild-type non-starter host lb. casei strain e utilizes lactose via a plasmid-encoded phosphotransferase system. for food-grade  cloning, a stable lactose-deficient mutant was constructed by deleting a 141-bp fragment from the phospho-beta-galactosidase gene lacg via gene replacement. the  deletion resulted in an inactive phospho-beta-galactosidase enzyme with an internal in-frame deletion of 47 amino acids. a complementation plasmid was constructed containing a replicon from lactococcus lactis, the lacg gene from lb. casei, and the constitutive promoter of pepr for lacg expression from lb. rhamnosus. the expression of the lacg gene from the resulting food-grade plasmid  pleb600 restored the ability of the lactose-negative mutant strain to grow on lactose to the wild-type level. the vector pleb600 was used for expression of the proline iminopeptidase gene pepi from lb. helveticus in lb. casei. the results show that the food-grade expression system reported in this paper can be used for expression of foreign genes in lb. casei.

TI  == the evaluation of mixtures of yeast and potato extracts in growth media for biomass production of lactic cultures.
AB  == the effectiveness of yeast extracts (ye) and potato extracts (pe) to promote growth of seven lactic cultures was evaluated by automated spectrophotometry (as). two aspects of the growth curve were analysed: (1) maximum biomass obtained (using odmax) and (2) highest specific growth rate mu(max)) eleven lots from the  same pe-manufacturing process were examined for lot-to-lot variability. the odmax values of three of the seven strains were significantly affected by lot source, but mu(max) was not significantly affected. the growth of bacteria was systematically lower in base medium containing 100% pe than in base medium containing 100% ye for both odmax or mu(max) data, which could be related to the  lower content in nitrogen-based compounds in pe. in as assays, highest od values  for lactobacillus casei eq28, lactobacillus rhamnosus r-011, lactobacillus plantarum eq12, and streptococcus thermophilus r-083 were obtained with a mixture of pe and ye. fermentations (2 l) were also carried out to determine the accuracy of as to predict biomass levels obtained under fermentation trials. in these fermentations, replacement of 50% ye with pe was shown to enable good growth of s. thermophilus. with l. rhamnosus r-011, a high correlation (r2 = 0.95) was found between odmax data obtained in the as assays and that of the 2-l bioreactor when the same growth medium was used for both series of fermentations. however, as was not as efficient when industrial media were used for the bioreactor assays. the relationship was still good for odmax between as data and that of the bioreactor data with l. rhamnosus r-011 in industrial lbs medium (r2 = 0.87), but was very poor with the s. thermophilus r-083 on rosell #43 industrial medium (r2  = 0.33). since pe cost 40% less than ye, there are strong economic advantages in  considering such a partial replacement of ye by pe.

TI  == isolation, identification and changes in the composition of lactic acid bacteria  during the malting of two different barley cultivars.
AB  == malt has a complex microbial population, which changes as the malting process commences. little is known about the proliferation of lactic acid bacteria (lab)  in each of the malting phases. in this study, we determined the number of lab present in the different phases of malting with clipper and prisma barley cultivars. the strains were identified to species level by using numerical analysis of total soluble cell protein patterns, rapd-pcr banding patterns and 16s rrna sequencing. the number of viable lab in the barley before steep was higher in prisma than clipper (7.6 x 10(4) and 1.2 x 10(3) cfu/g, respectively).  despite this, the number of viable cells recorded in the first steep water was slightly higher for clipper (9.0 x 10(5) cfu/g) than prisma (5.5 x 10(5) cfu/g).  more or less, the same cell numbers were recorded for the two barley cultivars after the first and second dry stands. both cultivars displayed more or less the  same cell numbers (3.7 x 10(7) for clipper and 3.2 x 10(7) cfu/g for prisma) after the third day of germination. however, a higher number of lab were detected in the kilned prisma malt (6.9 x 10(4) cfu/g) than the clipper malt (1.5 x 10(4)  cfu/g). leuconostoc argentinum, le. lactis and weissella confusa were the most predominant in both cultivars. a few strains were identified as w. paramesenteroides (four strains), lactobacillus casei (five strains), lactococcus lactis (five strains) and lb. rhamnosus (two strains). lb. casei and lb. rhamnosus were not isolated from the prisma cultivar, while w. paramesenteroides  and lc. lactis were absent in the clipper cultivar. kilned malt of the clipper cultivar contained predominantly le. argentinum, whereas the prisma cultivar contained mainly lc. lactis. to our knowledge. this is the first report of lab in clipper and prisma barley and the various malting phases. the influence of the various groups of lactic acid bacteria on the fermenting ability of brewers' yeast is currently being determined.

TI  == cloning and expression of an oligopeptidase, pepo, with novel specificity from lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 (dr20).
AB  == oligopeptidases of starter and nonstarter lactic acid bacteria contribute to the  proteolytic events important in maturation and flavor development processes in cheese. this paper describes the molecular cloning, expression, and specificity of the oligopeptidase pepo from the probiotic nonstarter strain lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 (dr20). the pepo gene encodes a protein of 70.9 kda, whose primary sequence includes the hexxh motif present in certain classes of metallo-oligopeptidases. the pepo gene was cloned in l. rhamnosus hn001 and overexpressed in ptrkh2 from its own promoter, which was mapped by primer extension. it was further cloned in both pnz8020 and pnz8037 and overexpressed in lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris nz9000 from the nisa promoter. the purified pepo enzyme demonstrated unique cleavage specificity for alpha(s1)-casein fragment 1-23, hydrolyzing the bonds pro-5-ile-6, lys-7-his-8, his-8-gln-9, and gln-9-gly-10. the impact of this enzyme in cheese can now be assessed.

TI  == streptococcus thermophilus in cheddar cheese--production and fate of galactose.
AB  == the behaviour of streptococcus thermophilus in combination with lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris or subsp. lactis mesophilic starters in experimental cheddar cheese is reported. in a standard manufacturing procedure employing a 38  degrees c cook temperature, even very low levels (0.007%) of str. thermophilus combined with normal levels of the mesophilic starter (1.7%) resulted in increased rates of acid production, the formation of significant amounts of galactose (approximately 13 mmol/kg cheese), and populations nearly equivalent to those of the mesophilic lactic starter in the curd before salting. at a 41 degrees c cook temperature, the str. thermophilus attained a higher maximum population (approximately log 8.2 colony forming units (cfu)/g) than the lc. lactis subsp. cremoris (approximately log 6.8 cfu/g) and formed more galactose (approximately 28 mmol/kg). lactobacillus rhamnosus, deliberately added to a cheese made using str. thermophilus starter and which contained 24 mmol galactose/kg at day one, utilized all the galactose during the first 3 months of  cheese ripening. adventitious non-starter lactic acid bacteria had the potential  to utilize this substrate too, and a close relationship was demonstrated between  the increase in this flora and the disapearance of the galactose. some possible consequences for cheese quality of using str. thermophilus as a starter component are discussed.

AB  == mixed starters containing lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc cremoris and lactobacillus rhamnosus strains were produced on commercial starter media (mb complete, thermolac, marlac), as well as on milk. with the exception of marlac, the starters were cultured under ph control. the effect of media and incubation temperature (22 or 32 degrees c) on population ratios, on specific acidifying activities (saa) of the cultures as well as on their ability to produce aroma compounds in milk was studied. the starters had higher contents in lactobacilli when they were produced at 32 degrees c, whereas a tendency to obtain higher leuconostoc populations was observed at 22 degrees c. with respect to the lactococci, there was a significant interaction between temperature and growth medium for both strains. thus, le. cremoris t2 reached higher populations at 32 degrees c if grown in mb complete and thermolac, whereas in marlac and skim milk, viable counts were higher at 22 degrees c. the lactococci represented 50% of the  total population of the culture at the beginning of the incubation, but they composed between 80% and 99% of the total population following fermentation. the  best medium for growth of leuconostoc was milk, but populations of only 10(8) cfu/ml were reached. the lactobacilli did not grow well in mb complete, and their development was best in the low-phosphate marlac medium. the cultures grown on marlac had the highest saa values, whereas those grown on mb complete had the lowest. overall, more ethanol and diacetyl were detected in the fermented milks when the starters used to inoculate them were produced at 22 degrees c.

TI  == gut mucosal immunostimulation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the beneficial properties of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on human health have been frequently demonstrated. the interaction of lab with the lymphoid cells associated to the gut to activate the mucosal immune system and the mechanisms by which they can exert an adjuvant effect is still unclear, as well as if this property is common for all the lab. we studied the influence of the oral administration of different geneous of lab such as lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. plantarum, lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus. we determined if the lab assayed were able to stimulate the specific, the non-specific immune response (inflammatory response), or both. we demonstrated that all the bacteria assayed were able to increase the number of iga producing cells associated to the lamina  propria of small intestine. this effect was dose dependent. the increase in iga+  producing cells was not always correlated with an increase in the cd4+ t cell number, indicating that some lab assayed only induced clonal expansion of b cells triggered to produce iga. most of them, induced an increase in the number of cells involved in the inflammatory immune response. cd8+ t cell were diminished or not affected, with exception of l. plantarum that induced an increase at low dose. this fact would mean that lab are unable to induce cytotoxicity mechanisms. we demonstrated the importance in the selection of lab to be used as gut mucosal  adjuvant. the different behaviours observed among them on the gut mucosal immune  response, specially those that induce inflammatory immune response, show that not all the lab can be used as oral adjuvant and that the beneficial effect of them can not generalized to genous or specie. the immunoadjuvant capacity would be a property of the strain assayed.

TI  == x-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase gene (pepx) is part of the glnra operon in lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  == a peptidase gene expressing x-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (pepx) activity was cloned from lactobacillus rhamnosus 1/6 by using the chromogenic substrate l-glycyl-l-prolyl-beta-naphthylamide for screening of a genomic library in escherichia coli. the nucleotide sequence of a 3.5-kb hindiii fragment expressing the peptidase activity revealed one complete open reading frame (orf) of 2,391 nucleotides. the 797-amino-acid protein encoded by this orf was shown to be 40, 39, and 36% identical with pepxs from lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, and lactococcus lactis, respectively. by northern analysis with a pepx-specific probe, transcripts of 4.5 and 7.0 kb were detected, indicating that pepx is part of a polycistronic operon in l. rhamnosus. cloning and sequencing of the upstream region of pepx revealed the presence of two orfs of 360 and 1,338 bp that were shown to be able to encode proteins with high homology to glnr and glna proteins, respectively. by multiple primer extension analyses, the only functional promoter in the pepx region was located 25 nucleotides upstream of glnr. northern analysis with glna- and pepx-specific probes indicated that transcription from glnr promoter results in a 2.0-kb dicistronic glnr-glna transcript and also in a longer read-through polycistronic transcript of 7.0 kb that was detected with both probes in samples from cells in exponential growth phase. the glna gene was disrupted by a single-crossover recombinant event using  a nonreplicative plasmid carrying an internal part of glna. in the disruption mutant, glnra-specific transcription was derepressed 10-fold compared to the wild type, but the 7.0-kb transcript was no longer detectable with either the glna- or pepx-specific probe, demonstrating that pepx is indeed part of glnra operon in l. rhamnosus. reverse transcription-pcr analysis further supported this operon structure. an extended stem-loop structure was identified immediately upstream of pepx in the glna-pepx intergenic region, a sequence that showed homology to a 23s-5s intergenic spacer and to several other l. rhamnosus-related entries in data banks.

TI  == study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. antigens administered orally can interact with m cells of peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. we have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance  the gut inflammatory immune response. the aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. we studied iga+ and igm+ b cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and cd4+ t cells and iga anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by  oral administration of lactobacillus casei, lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lb.  acidophilus, lb. plantarum, lb. rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, and streptococcus  salivarius ssp. thermophilus. the increase in the iga+ b cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the iga cycle by interaction with m cells from peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. the igm+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from igm+ to iga+. the increase in the cd4+ cells suggests interaction of peyer's patches and  enhancement of the b- and t-cell migration. the anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. we demonstrated that lb. casei and lb. plantarum were able to interact with peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in iga-, cd4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase  in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. although lb. rhamnosus and strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. lactococcus lactis and lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of iga+ cells entering the iga cycle but not cd4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated b lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. we did not determine specific antibodies against lc. lactis or lb. bulgaricus.

AB  == the influence of oat bran oligosaccharides on carbohydrate utilization and fermentation end-products was studied with reference to three different lactic acid bacteria (lab: lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum and lactococcus lactis). the main results were that all three lab utilized oat beta-gluco-oligosaccharides, while only l. plantarum utilized xylo-oligosaccharides. the main products of lab metabolism were lactic acid, acetic acid, formic acid and ethanol. the results indicated that oat beta-gluco-oligosaccharides and xylo-oligosaccharides induce lab to form the end-products of a typical mixed-acid fermentation. the formation of mixed-acid production from xylo-oligosaccharides was mainly due to the starvation of cells.  this study indicates that oat bran oligosaccharides affect both qualitatively and quantitatively the fermentation end-products of lab grown on these substrates. this should be taken into account when selecting strains for new fermented cereal based food products.
