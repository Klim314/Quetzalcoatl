TI  == antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime-avibactam against gram-negative organisms collected from u.s. medical centers in 2012.
AB  == the activities of the novel beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combination ceftazidime-avibactam and comparator agents were evaluated against a contemporary collection of clinically significant gram-negative bacilli. avibactam is a novel  non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor that inhibits ambler class a, c, and some d enzymes. a total of 10,928 gram-negative bacilli-8,640 enterobacteriaceae, 1,967 pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 321 acinetobacter sp. isolates-were collected from 73 u.s. hospitals and tested for susceptibility by reference broth microdilution methods in a central monitoring laboratory (jmi laboratories, north liberty, ia, usa). ceftazidime was combined with avibactam at a fixed concentration of 4 mug/ml. overall, 99.8% of enterobacteriaceae strains were inhibited at a ceftazidime-avibactam mic of </=4 mug/ml. ceftazidime-avibactam was active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-phenotype escherichia  coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, meropenem-nonsusceptible (mic>/=2 mug/ml) k. pneumoniae, and ceftazidime-nonsusceptible enterobacter cloacae. among esbl-phenotype k. pneumoniae strains, 61.1% were meropenem susceptible and 99.3%  were inhibited at a ceftazidime-avibactam mic of </=4 mug/ml. among p. aeruginosa strains, 96.9% were inhibited at a ceftazidime-avibactam mic of </=8 mug/ml, and  susceptibility rates for meropenem, ceftazidime, and piperacillin-tazobactam were 82.0, 83.2, and 78.3%, respectively. ceftazidime-avibactam was the most active compound tested against meropenem-nonsusceptible p. aeruginosa (mic50/mic90, 4/16 mug/ml; 87.3% inhibited at </=8 mug/ml). acinetobacter spp. (ceftazidime-avibactam mic50/mic90, 16/>32 mug/ml) showed high rates of resistance to most tested agents. in summary, ceftazidime-avibactam demonstrated  potent activity against a large collection of contemporary gram-negative bacilli  isolated from patients in u.s. hospitals in 2012, including organisms that are resistant to most currently available agents, such as k. pneumoniae carbapenemase (kpc)-producing enterobacteriaceae and meropenem-nonsusceptible p. aeruginosa.

TI  == [diversity analysis of biofilm bacteria on tracheal tubes removed from intubated  neonates].
AB  == objective: the catheter-related infections caused by mechanical ventilation have  become a intractable clinical problem, and it is related to the formation of bacterial biofilm (bf) on the surface of the implanted material. the majority of  natural biofilms are formed by multiple bacterial species. however, there always  only one or limited species were detected on tracheal tubes removed from intubated neonates by using traditional methods including bacterium culture and antigen detection. the aims of this study were to observe the bacterial communities diversity of bf on endotracheal tube (ett), and discuss the difference between traditional bacterium culture methods and the use of molecular biology techniques on the basis of denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), to provide new ideas for clinical prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections. method: thirty-five etts were obtained from 26 neonates on  mechanical ventilator (from october 2012 to march 2013) in department of neonatology of children's hospital. among the patients, 18 were boys and 8 girls, and 19 patients were < 37 weeks gestational age and 7 patients >/= 37 weeks. dgge profiling of 16s rdna gene amplicons was used to assess the diversity of the bacterial population by using the software of quantity one. ta cloning kit and sequencing were used to investigate the distribution of bacteria and common dominant bacteria in ett-bf. result: the mean bands of 35 etts cases were 13.8 +/- 5.4 from 16s rdna pcr-dgge, and the mean shanon-wiener indexes was 2.42 +/- 0.38. the 16 etts were collected in different stages of diseases from the 7 patients. the indwelling days of 6/7 patients' etts increased, the shanon-siener  indexes were decreased. among the 6 cases from different basic illnesses, and there were different shanon-siener indexes. the result of molecular cloning and sequencing for 24 dominant bands showed that 35 cases (100%) contained klebsiella sp., 28 cases (80%) had pseudomonas sp., 27 cases (77%) had streptococcus sp., and 32 cases (91%) had uncultured bacterium, while more than 2 bacterial species  were found in 34 cases (97%). 28/35 (80%) klebsiella sp. and 22/27(82%) streptococcus sp. were accompanied by pseudomonas sp.. there were 22 positive results of sputum culture from 26 newborns, including 10 strains (45%) of klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 strains (9%) of acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae and non-cultured bacterium in each patient (5%), but only one bacterium isolated from every sputum. eight sputum samples had normal flora only, corresponding to the etts on which klebsiella and other bacterial genuses were found. conclusion: the diversity of microbiota in bf on ett was confirmed. 16s rdna pcr-dgge could produce a more complete picture of bacterial community than traditional bacterium culture method. klebsiella, pseudomonas and streptococcus were common dominant bacteria in ett-bf, and there might be interactions among them in the formation of bf.

TI  == diversity of the bacterial and fungal microflora from the midgut and cuticle of phlebotomine sand flies collected in north-western iran.
AB  == background: phlebotomine sand flies are the vectors of the leishmaniases, parasitic diseases caused by leishmania spp. little is known about the prevalence and diversity of sand fly microflora colonizing the midgut or the cuticle. particularly, there is little information on the fungal diversity. this information is important for development of vector control strategies. methodology/principal findings: five sand fly species: phlebotomus papatasi, p. sergenti, p. kandelakii, p. perfiliewi and p. halepensis were caught in bileh savar and kaleybar in north-western iran that are located in endemic foci of visceral leishmaniasis. a total of 35 specimens were processed. bacterial and fungal strains were identified by routine microbiological methods. we characterized 39 fungal isolates from the cuticle and/or the midgut. they belong  to six different genera including penicillium (17 isolates), aspergillus (14), acremonium (5), fusarium (1), geotrichum (1) and candida (1). we identified 33 gram-negative bacteria: serratia marcescens (9 isolates), enterobacter cloacae (6), pseudomonas fluorescens (6), klebsiella ozaenae (4), acinetobacter sp. (3),  escherichia coli (3), asaia sp. (1) and pantoea sp. (1) as well as gram-positive  bacteria bacillus subtilis (5) and micrococcus luteus (5) in 10 isolates. conclusion/significance: our study provides new data on the microbiotic diversity of field-collected sand flies and for the first time, evidence of the presence of asaia sp. in sand flies. we have also found a link between physiological stages (unfed, fresh fed, semi gravid and gravid) of sand flies and number of bacteria that they carry. interestingly pantoea sp. and klebsiella ozaenae have been isolated in old world sand fly species. the presence of latter species on sand fly cuticle and in the female midgut suggests a role for this arthropod in dissemination of these pathogenic bacteria in endemic areas. further experiments  are required to clearly delineate the vectorial role (passive or active) of sand  flies.

TI  == verification of monoplex and multiplex linear-after-the-exponential pcr gene-specific sepsis assays using clinical isolates.
AB  == aims: to verify monoplex and multiplex gene-specific linear-after-the-exponential polymerase chain reaction (late-pcr) assays for identifying 17 microbial pathogens (i.e., klebsiella sp., acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus,  enterobacter sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, coagulase negative staphylococci, enterococcus sp., candida sp.) commonly associated with septicaemia using clinical isolates. methods and results: clinical isolates of each target pathogen were collected from the university of california, davis medical center (ucdmc) microbiology laboratory. five microlitres (mul) of each culture suspension (1 x 10(8) cfu ml(-1) ) were added to 20 mul of monoplex mastermix. dna extracted from clinical isolates was tested in multiplex. monoplex assays demonstrated 100% sensitivity at this input level, except enterobacter cloacae (2.7%), ac. baumannii (57%) and ps. aeruginosa (97.8%). all clinical isolates were positive in multiplex, with the exception of two ac. baumannii, two klebsiella oxytoca and two candida parapsilosis isolates. conclusions: sixteen pathogens can be identified by monoplex late-pcr assays with sensitivities >/= 97.8%. the multiplex assay demonstrated 91.4% sensitivity when tested with dna extracted from 70 different target strains. significance and impact of the study: this study demonstrates the potential of late-pcr to serve as an adjunct to culture if the reagents are optimized for sensitivity. results warrant further testing through analytical and clinical validation of the multiplex assay.

TI  == genetic diversity of endophytic diazotrophs of the wild rice, oryza alta and identification of the new diazotroph, acinetobacter oryzae sp. nov.
AB  == thirty-three endophytic diazotrophs were isolated from surface-sterilized leaves, stem, and roots of wild rice oryza alta. the sds-page profile of total protein and insertion sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (is-pcr) fingerprinting grouped the isolates into four clusters (i-iv). the 16s rrna gene sequence homology of the representative strains b21, b31, b1, and b23 of clusters i, ii, iii, and iv were assigned to pseudomonas oleovorans (99.2% similarity), burkholderia fungorum (99.4% similarity), enterobacter cloacae (98.9% similarity), and acinetobacter johnsonii (98.4% similarity), respectively. the results showed wide genetic diversity of the putative diazotrophic strains of the wild rice, o. alta, and the strains of cluster iv are the first report of nitrogen-fixing acinetobacter species. the cell size, phenotypic characters, total protein profile, genomic dna fingerprinting, dna-dna hybridization, and antibiotic resistance differentiated strain b23(t) from its closest relatives a.  johnsonii lmg999(t) and acinetobacter haemolyticus lmg996(t). the dna-dna hybridization also distinguished the strain b23(t) from the closely related acinetobacter species. based on these data, a novel species, acinetobacter oryzae sp. nov., and strain b23(t) (=lmg25575(t) = cgmcc1.10689(t)) as the type strain were proposed.

TI  == prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria at a tertiary-care teaching hospital in mexico: special focus on acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == our aim was to determine the prevalence of multidrug resistance of acinetobacter  baumannii and other pathogens at a tertiary-care teaching hospital in mexico over a 3-year period. clinical isolates of a. baumannii (n = 550), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 250), some enterobacteriaceae species (n = 500) and staphylococcus aureus (n = 250) collected over a 3-year period were included. susceptibility tests were performed by the broth microdilution method. 74% of a.  baumannii, 40% of escherichia coli, 34% of p. aeruginosa, 22% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 9% of enterobacter cloacae, and 7% of serratia sp. were multidrug resistant. 59% of a. baumannii clinical isolates were meropenem-resistant. a. baumannii isolates from the lower respiratory tract were the most susceptible, followed by urine clinical isolates. species from enterobacteriaceae showed susceptibility rates higher than 90% to meropenem and tigecycline and serratia sp. showed the highest susceptibility to the drugs evaluated. for p. aeruginosa,  the most potent drug was levofloxacin, followed by meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam. with regard to s. aureus, 96% of the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, followed by tigecycline and minocycline (91% of strains susceptible). the high multidrug resistance observed underscores the need for surveillance of bacterial drug resistance.

TI  == novel insights about class 2 integrons from experimental and genomic epidemiology.
AB  == in order to contribute to the knowledge of the architecture and epidemiology of class 2 integrons, we performed a class 2 integron molecular survey in which we analyzed 726 isolates in two bacterial populations from environmental and nonepidemiologically related clinical samples, respectively, collected from 1982  to 2007. we recovered the inti2 gene from 130 of 726 isolates, most of which were clinical isolates, and only 1 (a psychrophilic pseudomonas sp.) was from a water  sample. unlike the widespread distribution of class 1 integrons within gram-negative bacilli, only acinetobacter baumannii and enterobacter cloacae harbored class 2 integrons at a high frequency in our collection. class 2 integrons with six novel cassette arrays were documented. characterization of the transposition module of tn7, the genetic platform in which class 2 integrons have always been reported, showed tns modules with a mosaic genetic structure. a bioinformatic analysis performed with the tns genes present in sequence databases, the finding of inti2 not associated with tns genes, and the genetic examination of novel tns-like genes found in three isolates indicated the possibility of the independent evolution of the two components related to horizontal gene transfer, the class 2 integrons and the tn7 transposons.

TI  == the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of some medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria.
AB  == background: in effort to identify novel bacterial agents, this study was initiated to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of 17 crude extracts from 12 medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria. methodology: the antimicrobial activities of plant extracts were evaluated against clinically proved beta-lactam-resistant bacteria (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus sp.) and reference strains of bacteria (escherichia coli atcc 35218, enterobacter aerogenes atcc 29751, e. aerogenes atcc 13048, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 and enterococcus hirae atcc 9790) by using disc-diffusion and agar-dilution assays. results: the crude plant extracts demonstrated broad spectrum activity against all bacteria tested with inhibition zones in the range of 8-30 mm. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values of different plant extracts against the tested bacteria were found to range from <or= 0.3 to >or= 10 mg ml(-1). the most active plant extracts were  from dortenia picta and bridelia micrantha (mic: 1.25-10 mg ml(-1)) on beta-lactam-resistant gram-negative bacilli and the extracts from b. micrantha, mallotus oppositifolius, garcinia lucida, garcinia. kola, campylospermum densiflorum (leaves) and c. zenkeri (root) on beta-lactam-resistant gram-positive cocci (mic: <or= 0.3-5 mg ml(-1)). conclusion: of the 17 plant extracts studied,  seven showed good antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria. the stem bark of b. micrantha and the leaves of d. picta were most active towards beta-lactamase producing gram-negative bacilli. this study shows that medicinal plants could be sources of compounds which can be used to fight against beta-lactam resistant bacteria.

TI  == changes in bacterial isolates from burn wounds and their antibiograms: a 20-year  study (1986-2005).
AB  == background: our aim is to elucidate shifts in the bacterial spectrum colonising burn wounds and corresponding antibiotic susceptibilities during a 20-year study  period. methods: microbiological results from burn patients collected between 1986 and 2005 were analysed retrospectively. results: staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (20.8%), followed by escherichia coli (13.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (10.9%), enterococcus sp. (9.7%), enterobacter cloacae (5.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5%), acinetobacter sp. (3.2%), proteus mirabilis (2%) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.4%). susceptibility of s. aureus to broad-spectrum substances such as ciprofloxacin or penicillinase-stable penicillins has waned, others such as cotrimoxazole or netilmicin remained effective. not a single resistance against vancomycin was recorded. increases in methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) were pronounced (3% in 1986-1997 (the first of the three study periods) to 16% in 1998-2001 and 13% in 2002-2005). results for methicillin-resistant cns (mrcns) show an even greater increase. p. aeruginosa has shown increasing susceptibility  against netilmicin (1986-1989: 84%, 2002-2005: 95%). susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to ceftazidime has decreased markedly. s. maltophilia has shown clinically relevant susceptibility mainly against ciprofloxacin. acinetobacter sp. have shown little susceptibility to most antibiotics. imipenem or meropenem have been very reliable reserve antibiotics throughout the study period for the fermenting enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae and p. mirabilis), with susceptibilities of or near 100%. conclusion: in-depth knowledge of the bacteria causing infectious complications and of their antibiotic susceptibilities is a prerequisite for treating burn patients. our study shows shifts in the microbial spectrum and their antibiogram, which mandate frequent reassessments.

TI  == nature of bacteria found on some wards in sultan qaboos university hospital, oman.
AB  == this study aims to determine what objects lying in the hospital environment or brought in from outside contribute to the introduction of bacteria associated with nosocomial infections. one hundred swab specimens collected from children's  toys, sinks, door handles, telephone handsets and flowers brought into the hospital were plated on different culture media. colonial growth on the media was purified and identified subsequently using standard bacteriological methods. of the 100 samples cultured, 61 (61%) grew a range of bacteria including pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=14, 23.0%), acinetobacter spp. (n=13, 21.3%), serratia spp. (n=9, 14.7%), staphylococcus epidermidis (n=9, 14.7%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n=4, 6.6%), staphylococcus aureus (n=4, 6.6%), enterobacter cloacae (n=3, 4.9%), pantoea sp. (n=2, 3.3%), chryseobacterium sp. (n=2, 3.3%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1, 1.6%). although all the serratia, enterobacter, klebsiella and pantoea species isolates showed varying degrees of resistance to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime and cefotaxime, all were resistant to ampicillin. chryseobacterium and stenotrophomonas species isolates were resistant to amikacin, imipenem, gentamicin and ceftazidime, to which only three isolates of pseudomonas species were resistant. all the staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to methicillin. although there has been no major outbreak of a nosocomial infection in the hospital, it is strongly recommended that effective control measures (e.g., sampling the hospital water supply, disinfecting children's toys, use of appropriate hand washing and checking some of the disinfectants for presence of bacteria) are needed. these measures are necessary  to ensure that the antibiotic-resistant strains identified in this study are not  allowed to spread in the hospital.

TI  == [distribution and drug-resistance of 3 500 gram-negative bacteria in guangzhou].
AB  == objective: to investigate the distribution and drug-resistance of the common gram-negative bacteria in guangzhou. methods: from july 2001 to august 2003, the  resistance of 3 500 strains of common gram-negative bacteria isolated from 13 hospitals in guangzhou to 15 to 21 antibiotics was determined by standard kirby-bauer method according to the guidelines of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls, 2000). whonet-5 software was used to analyze the data. results: totally 3 500 gram-negative bacterial strains were isolated from 13 hospitals in guangzhou in the past two years, and the top 3 most common pathogens of them were escherichia coli (1 244 strains, 35.5%), klebsiella pneumoniae (900 strains, 25.7%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (547 strains, 15.6 %). the total prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls)-producing strains was 31.0% (1 084/3 500). the prevalences of esbls-producing strains in the escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter sp., other enterobacter sp., stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and proteus sp. in guangzhou were 38.7%, 37.9%, 5.3%, 55.2%, 8.2%, 27.7%, 33.3% and 9.2%, respectively. among them, 1 463 (41.8%) strains was isolated from the respiratory tract and 943 (26.9%) from the urinary tract. according to our surveillance, the clinical antibacterial drug with the lowest total drug-resistance rates of gram-negative bacteria was imipenem (8.7%) followed by cefoperazone/sulbactam (13.3%), while that with the highest resistance was ampicillin (90.9%) followed by nalidixic acid (69.3%). imipenem was the most effective agents against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter sp., other enterobacter sp., and proteus sp. isolated from 13 hospitals in guangzhou, with drug-resistant rates of 1.1%, 0.5%, 0.6%, 3.2%, 0.8% and 0%, respectively, whereas the most effective agents against pseudomonas  aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia was cefoperazone/sulbactam, with the  drug-resistance rates of 10.8% and 15.9%, respectively. most of the isolates were multi-drug resistant. the resistance rates of esbls-producing strains to 15 to 21 antimicrobial agents were much higher than those of non-esbls-producing strains (p<0.05). conclusions: drug resistance of the clinical isolates is a serious problem in guangzhou, and the increasing prevalence of esbls-producing strains of other bacteria should be given full attention. an unanimous and effective strategy for controlling this problem is urgently needed. imipenem and cefoperazone/sulbactam are the most effective antibiotics against the gram-negative bacteria isolated from the 13 hospitals in guangzhou.

TI  == sepsis in burned patients.
AB  == a prospective study was conducted from june 2001 to may 2002 at the burns unit of hospital regional da asa norte, brasilia, brazil. during the period of the study, 252 patients were treated at the burns unit, 49 (19.4%) developed clinically and  microbiologically proven sepsis. twenty-six (53.1%) were males and 23 (46.9%) females with a mean age of 22 years (range one to 89 years) and mean burned body  surface area of 37.7 +/- 18.4% (range 7 to 84%). forty-three patients had flame burns, five a scald and one an electric burn. these 49 patients had a total of 62 septic episodes. forty (81.6%) patients had only one and nine (18.4%) had up to three episodes of sepsis. thirty (61.2%) patients had their first septicemic episode either earlier or by one week postburn. out of 62 septic episodes, 58 were due to bacteria and four due to candida sp. the most common bacteria isolated from blood culture were staphylococccus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae. eleven (18.9%) episodes were due to oxacillin resistant staphylococcus aureus. acinetobacter baumannii was sensitive to ampicillin/sulbactam in 71.4% and to imipenem in 85.7% of the cases. the primary  foci of sepsis were the burn wound in 15 (24.2%) episodes. the most common clinical findings of sepsis in these patients were fever, dyspnea, hypotension and oliguria. the most common laboratory findings of these patients were anemia,  leukocytosis, hypoalbuminemia and thrombocytopenia. twelve (24.5%) patients died. the appropriate knowledge of clinical, epidemiological, laboratorial and microbiological aspects of sepsis in burned patients permits an adequate diagnosis and treatment of this complication.

TI  == characterization of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in rendered animal products.
AB  == antibiotics are used in food animal production to treat diseases and also to improve performance. antibiotics are not used on all farms, and antibiotic resistance is occasionally found on farms that do not use antibiotics. rendered animal protein products are often included in poultry feeds and could potentially serve as a source of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. one hundred sixty-five rendered animal protein products from cattle, poultry, and fish were aseptically  collected from poultry feed mills. fifty-five percent of the poultry meal samples had detectable levels of gram-negative bacteria ranging from 40 to 10,440 colony-forming units/g of sample. poultry meal and meat and bone meal had the greatest number of samples with bacteria resistant to five or more antibiotics. a high percentage of feed samples (85%) contained bacteria resistant to amoxicillin, ampicillin, clavulanic acid, or cephalothin, whereas few samples contained bacteria resistant to ciprofloxacin, kanamycin, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. acinetobacter calcoaceticus, citrobacter freundii, and enterobacter cloacae were the most commonly isolated antibiotic-resistant bacteria. isolation for salmonella was also performed, with 14% of the meat and bone meal samples containing salmonella sp. only one of the meat and bone meal isolates, salmonella livingstone, was resistant to five or more antibiotics. many of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria contained integrons, genetic elements that mediate multiple drug resistance.

TI  == microbiological investigation on black crusts from open-air stone monuments of bologna (italy).
AB  == samples of black crusts taken from open-air stone monuments in bologna dating back to between the twelfth and the nineteenth century were considered. the microbiological test procedures isolated from a high number of chemoorganotrophic bacteria, each of the samples although it was expected to find chemo-lithotrophic (specially sulfur-oxidizing and nitrifying) bacteria on account of the great amounts of sulphur, carbon, nitrogen dioxides and ammonia in the air. sporogenous and asporogenous species were found among the isolated bacteria: the first were recognized as bacillus subtilis, bacillus brevis, bacillus licheniformis, bacillus mycoides and bacillus megaterium; the latter were corynebacterium glutamicum, actinomyces sp., alcaligenes denitrificans subsp. denitrificans, flavobacterium breve, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas stutzeri. these species were differently associated in the samples studied with a frequency of more than sixty-four per cent. this finding leads us  to believe that their presence in the black crusts is not occasional, but the result of an ecologically significant process of colonization. although behavioural tests (solubilization of calcium carbonate, of calcium sulphate and marble dust) did not reveal lithic activity among the bacteria studied, one can presume that their behaviour in nature - as a more or less complex microbial consortium - can be totally different and exert a decomposing action with regard  to several minerals, most of them acidify the media in which they develop.

TI  == conversion of unsaturated fatty acids by bacteria isolated from compost.
AB  == a compost mixture amended with soybean oil was enriched in microorganisms that transformed unsaturated fatty acids (ufas). when oleic acid or 10-ketostearic acid was the selective fatty acid, sphingobacterium thalpophilum (nrrl b-23206, nrrl b-23208, nrrl b-23209, nrrl b-23210, nrrl b-23211, nrrl b-23212), acinetobacter spp. (nrrl b-23207, nrrl b-23213), and enterobacter cloacae (nrrl b-23264, nrrl b-23265, nrrl b-23266) represented isolates that produced either hydroxystearic acid, ketostearic acid, or incomplete decarboxylations. when ricinoleic (12-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic) acid was the selective ufa, enterobacter cloacae (nrrl b-23257, nrrl b-23267) and escherichia sp. (nrrl b-23259) produced  12-c and 14-c homologous compounds, and pseudomonas aeruginosa (nrrl b-23256, nrrl b-23260) converted ricinoleate to a trihydroxyoctadecenoate product. also, various enterobacter, pseudomonas, and serratia spp. appeared to decarboxylate linoleate substrate incompletely. these saprophytic, compost bacteria were aerobic or facultative anaerobic gram-negative and decomposed ufas through decarboxylation, hydroxylation, and hydroperoxidation mechanisms.

AB  == nosocomial infections encountered in intensive care units are frequently due to gram negative bacilli among which stenotrophomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter sp., and enterobacter sp. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro bactericidal activity of the new broad spectrum cephalosporins cefepime (fep) and cefpirome (cpo) alone or in combination with amikacin (akn), gentamicin (gtn) or ciprofloxacin (cip) against acinetobacter baumannii, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and enterobacter cloacae producing a derepressed cephalosporinase. this study was performed by using the time-kill curve method on 24 h with a starting inoculum of 10(6) - 10(7) cfu/ml. the combination of fep (4 mg/l) with akn (4 mg/l) against a. baumanii only results in about 1 log decrease at 24 h, but when fep is combined at 8 mg/l, the decrease reaches 4 log in 24 h. the combination of fep (16 and 32 mg/l) clavulanic acid (4 mg/l) resulted in 3 log decrease at 24 h. when combined with cip 2 mg/l, fep (16 and 32 mg) resulted in 5 and 6 log decrease in 24 h respectively. there were no survival bacteria at 6 h when fep (32 mg/l) was combined with clavulanic acid (4 mg/l) and gtn (8 mg/l) at 6 h. used alone fep (1 mg/l) or cpo (1 mg/l) against e. cloacae, a 3 log decrease occurs at 6 h followed by a regrowth at 24 h. combined with akn (2 mg/l), fep (1  mg/l) results in a 6 log decrease at 24 h, when cpo at 2 mg/l is needed for an equivalent result. these data show synergistic bactericidal activity of both new  extended cephalosporins combined with akn, gtn or cip at concentrations achievable in biological fluid with adaptative dosage regimen.

TI  == [variation in transfer resistance to cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam in strains of acinetobacter sp., enterobacter sp. and citrobacter sp. isolated from  the same university hospitals].
AB  == background: in the last decade were in sr documented new problems in resistance to the newer antibiotics that with regard to their structure and antibacterial properties resisted to the known mechanism of bacterial resistance. the emergence of multiple drug resistance to the new betalactams is connected both with frequent application of these drugs in the hospitals and transfer of r plasmids.  methods and results: we studied composition and transferability of resistance to  newer betalactam antibiotics in strains of acinetobacter sp., enterobacter sp, and citrobacter sp. isolated during one month in patients from two teaching university hospitals. all strains studied were resistant to cefotaxime (ctx), ceftazidime (caz) and aztreonam (atm) but acinetobacter strains, although resistant also to caz and atm transferred the resistance to ctx only. thus, resistance to caz and atm has a chromosomal origin in these strains. a strain of  citrobacter sp., resistant to ctx, caz and atm, produced a esbl betalactamase detectable in a double-disk diffusion method (fig. 1). an enterobacter cloacae strain transfers directly the resistance to all new betalactams indicated. their  hydrolysis by these strains points to their production of new types of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases esbl). conclusions: we strongly recommend to be strictly rational in the use of new betalactams of ctx, cza or atm type because it is suspected that, especially in so-called empirical prophylaxis or treatment, they exert a strong selective pressure toward the prevalence of mutants with transferable esbl-producing nosocomial bacteria resistant to these drugs.

TI  == a comparative study of the bbl crystal enteric/nonfermenter identification system and the biomerieux api20e and api20ne identification systems after overnight incubation.
AB  == the bbl crystal enteric/nonfermenter (crystal, becton dickinson microbiology systems) is a new multi-test identification system for gram negative rods requiring no oil overlay or addition of reagents. one hundred and three selected  gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate api20e or api20ne (biomerieux) reading after overnight incubation. the isolates included in the study, and the number tested,  were as follows: acinetobacter sp, 8; aeromonas hydrophila, 1; citrobacter diversus, 1; citrobacter freundii, 1; escherichia coli, 13; enterobacter aerogenes, 10; enterobacter agglomerans, 2; enterobacter cloacae, 6; klebsiella oxytoca, 6; klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; morganella morganii, 2; proteus mirabilis, 6; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; salmonella sp, 2; salmonella typhi, 1; serratia marcescens, 1; shigella sonnei, 2; shigella sp, 2; vibrio metschnikovii, 1; xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, yersinia enterocolitica, 2. the api20e and api20ne systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the api systems compared to 3 with the crystal. crystal is more convenient than api for routine clinical use because it  requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use.

TI  == the danger of infections of the hospitalized patients with the microorganisms present in preparations and in the hospital environment.
AB  == two strains-s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus, resistant to antibiotics, were isolated from previously non-opened preparations made by the hospital pharmacy and industrially produced. after application in the surgery ward, two enterobacter agglomerans strains, resistant to antibiotics were detected in oral mixtures. the resistant bacteria, b. cereus and 4 strains of ps. aeruginosa, were also found in the purified water. in hospital environment 9 strains of staphylococci, resistant to the tested antibiotics were found. only one of them was s. aureus (detected on the wall), the others being coagulase-negative staphylococci. most of them were isolated from the floor, but  also from the wall, table and from the air in surgical and ophthalmological wards and in the hospital pharmacy. the most dangerous were three gram-negative strains resistant to all tested antibiotics. they were isolated from the floor (enterobacter cloacae), from the wall (proteus mirabilis) and from the container  with oral mixture in infant ward (ps. malthophilia). many strains resistant to many antibiotics were detected on the floor of surgical, nephrological and infantile wards as well as from the pharmacies: enterobacter cloacae (7 strains), citrobacter freundi, ps. aeruginosa, ps. cepacia (2 strains), ps. maltophilia (2  strains) and moraxella. many resistant strains were also present on the walls (e. coli, ps. mirabilis, ps. cepacia, alcaligens, acinetobacter). the resistant strains were rarely observed on the table, medical equipment and on personnel hands. klebsiella oxytoca and ps. paucimobilis were found on the table, ps. maltophilia on the dropper and on the rim of the container with oral mixture. acinetobacter and pseudomonas sp. were isolated from the medicine glass, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas sp. from the personnel hands in the pharmacies.

TI  == the pattern of respiratory infection in patients with lung cancer.
AB  == we examined retrospectively the pattern of respiratory infection in 579 patients  with lung cancer admitted to nagasaki university hospital during the past 15 years. a total of 139 patients (24.0%) developed respiratory infection. the rates of pulmonary infection associated with large (36.2%) and small cell carcinomas (33.6%) were significantly higher than those with squamous cell carcinoma (26.0%) and adenocarcinoma (17.3%). advanced stages of lung cancer were associated with higher complication rates (stage i: 6.3%, stage ii: 15.9%, stage iii: 27.9%, and  stage iv: 33.8%). deceased patients showed a significantly higher rate of pulmonary infection than alive patients during the period of investigation. isolated organisms in excess of 10(7) cfu/ml in sputum or 10(4) cfu/ml in bronchial aspirate were mainly gram-negative bacteria (68.8%), such as haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter sp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the number of patients infected with gram-positive bacteria increased markedly after 1982. our results suggest that a successful control of pulmonary infection associated with lung cancer is important in improving the prognosis of lung malignancy.

TI  == resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in barbados.
AB  == resistance to third-generation, or extended-spectrum, cephalosporins caused by induction of class i beta-lactamases has been reported rarely from developing countries. seven isolates of cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative rods were recovered recently from urine, burns and ulcers in the queen elizabeth hospital,  barbados. the isolates were identified as acinetobacter calcoaceticus (2), citrobacter freundii (1), enterobacter cloacae (1), morganella morganii (1), providencia stuartii (1) and proteus sp. (1). induction of beta-lactamase by cefoxitin was demonstrated, and minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined by agar dilution. beta-lactamases were demonstrated by isoelectric focusing; the presence of chromosomal beta-lactamases was confirmed in at least three of the resistant isolates. the only antibiotics which were uniformly active against these resistant strains were imipenem and ciprofloxacin. these data confirm the existence of resistance to the third-generation cephalosporins in barbados, and emphasise the necessity for continuous surveillance of resistance patterns in the caribbean region.

TI  == analysis of polar lipids from some representative enterobacteria, plesiomonas and acinetobacter by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry.
AB  == fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (fab-ms) was used to analyse lipid extracts of bacteria to assess its usefulness for analysing anionic phospholipids of potential chemotaxonomic value. the following micro-organisms were tested: acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae (2 strains), escherichia coli (3 strains), hafnia alvei, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, plesiomonas shigelloides, proteus mirabilis (3 strains), serratia liquefaciens and serratia marcescens. negative-ion spectra provide data for twenty-seven major carboxylate  anions (m/z 209-325) and for thirty-seven major phospholipid anions (m/z 645-774). generally, the largest carboxylate peaks were due to 16:1, 16:0, cyc17  and 18:1 while the largest phospholipid anion peaks were due to pe(32:1), pe(33:1), pe(34:1), pe(34:2), pg(30:2), pg(31:2), pg(32:2), pg(34:1) and ps(33:0). however, quantitative differences were observed. for example, acinetobacter lacked pe (33:1) but had exceptionally high peaks at m/z 748, ps(33:0), and m/z 281, octadecanoate. unknown 'carboxylate' peaks were detected at m/z 254, 256, 261, 268, 282 and 301. in some cases, unknown peaks appeared to  constitute possible homologous series being separated by delta m/z of 14(identical to methylene). for chemotaxonomic purposes, the complexity of the data required numerical analysis. using the pearson coefficient of linear correlation, as a measure of association, it was possible to compare all strains  analysed. typical results for strain comparisons were as follows: ent. cloacae vs ent. cloacae, r = 0.90 (ent. cloacae vs ac. calcoaceticus, r = 0.46). thus fab-ms represents an excellent means of obtaining large quantities of data on polar lipids of a range of bacterial isolates, which may be suitable for chemotaxonomic purposes.

TI  == epidemiological role of arthropods detectable in health facilities.
AB  == a total of 161 arthropod specimens were collected from 55 sites in a health care  facility during july and september 1990. of the 116 bacterial isolates obtained from their body surfaces 6% were from parasites (mosquitoes), 59% from eusynanthropic arthropods (tenebrionid beetles, flies, german cockroaches, wasps), 16% from hemisynanthropic arthropods (ants, spiders) and 19% from occasionally encountered insects (non-biting midges, moths, beetles). most (88%)  of the isolated bacteria were gram-negative rods of the species e. coli, enterobacter, klebsiella, citrobacter, proteus, serratia, pseudomonas and acinetobacter. gram-positive cocci accounted for 13% of isolates and were primarily represented by coagulase-negative staphylococci. the highest isolation  rates were from body surfaces of flies, german cockroaches, non-biting midges (chironomids) and tenebrionid beetles. about one third of all isolates were resistant to more than three antimicrobials using a standard disc diffusion assay. the presence of multiple resistance to antibiotics was observed in two thirds of enterobacter isolates, namely those of enterobacter cloacae from the body surface of germany cockroaches, in 13% of citrobacter spp and in 8% of klebsiella spp as well as acinetobacter calcoaceticus strains. strains of morganella and hafnia species were very infrequent but all of them shared resistance to the antibiotics tested. in contrast, strains of serratia spp were relatively antibiotic-sensitive. the group of isolated gram-positive organisms was represented by two strains of staphylococcus hominis and one strain of enterococcus sp, all of them were multiply-resistant to antimicrobials.

TI  == assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  == blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (cfu) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. at intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (hs-glc). forty-six isolates including all those examined of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, s. faecalis, s. milleri, s. mitior, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia sp., enterobacter cloacae, bacterioides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, c. krusei and torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by hs-glc. hs-glc failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus. haemophilus influenzae, corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of s. epidermidis. the growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. no significant difference was found between hs-glc analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. all the yeast isolates were detected by hs-glc after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by hs-glc analysis than by other methods.

TI  == [sensitivity to fosfomycin of bacteria isolated at the pitie-salpetriere hospital in 1982 and 1983].
AB  == susceptibility of 16 056 strains isolated in 1982 and 1983 to fosfomycin (fos) was tested with mueller-hinton medium and discs 50 micrograms fos + 25 micrograms glucose-6-phosphate (g6p) (cutoff diameter 14 mm). for 3 411 strains, inhibition  zone diameters were recorded. almost all e. coli, citrobacter, salmonella and s.  aureus were susceptible to fos as well as 70% of serratia, e. cloacae, p. mirabilis and 50% of klebsiella and enterobacter sp. only 27% of p. aeruginosa, 20% of indole positive proteus and 8% of acinetobacter were sensitive to fos. e.  coli, citrobacter and s. aureus seem to exhibit the highest susceptibilities to fos. sensitivity rates of e. cloacae, serratia, p. aeruginosa, and especially klebsiella seemed slightly underestimated by the disk diffusion method, but differentiation between susceptible and resistant strains was facilitated by rating as susceptible those strains with inhibition zone diameters between 12 and 14 mm. this method also seemed to underrate the sensitivity of susceptible enterobacteriaceae, probably because of inadequate g6p concentrations at this point of the disk.

TI  == direct dilution sampling, quantitation, and microbial assessment of open-system ventilation circuits in intensive care units.
AB  == in a systematic approach, 37 duplicate samples of open system circuits (bennett ma-1 ventilators) of patients in medical and surgical intensive care units were processed by direct and serial (apha guidelines) dilutions. the paired difference test on 15 of the in-use circuitry solution samples indicated no difference between the direct and serial dilution methods (p less than 0.001). seventy-seven additional respiratory therapy circuitry samples from similar intensive care patients were analyzed via a direct dilution method alone and processed microbiologically. the direct dilution procedure was a rapid and accurate means of evaluation of microbial contamination in the range of greater than or equal to 10 to less than or equal to 10(6) cfu/ml. high densities of organisms frequently  were found. sites of contamination included the proximal or patient end of the circuitry (heaviest), the nebulizer trap, and the distal or humidifier portions of the circuitry. the contaminants found were predominantly gram-negative nonfermenters: acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. antitratus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas maltophilia, and flavobacterium meningosepticum. fermenters were klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus sp., enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, and enterobacter agglomerans. infrequently, gram-positive streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus spp. were noted.

TI  == in vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  == norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. we examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including  anaerobic species. it inhibited 90% (mic90) of strains of escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, salmonella and shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. the mics of proteus mirabilis, morganella sp., proteus vulgaris, proteus rettgeri, and providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 of serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. for pseudomonas aeruginosa the mic50, the mic75, and the mic90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic50 of pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the mic90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. yersinia, arizona, and aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was campylobacter. the activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the mic90s of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. all listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. the activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, ph, or inoculum size. there was no major difference between mic and minimum bactericidal concentration values. norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.

TI  == [kinetics of setting up of a human fecal flora in germ free mice and trial of decontamination of antibiotherapy (author's transl)].
AB  == we have tried in this study to reproduce in germfree mice a bacterial equilibrium observed previously in the gastrointestinal tract of child "l.n.", reared in a plastic isolator. eight bacterial strains were studied. seven had been fortuitously introduced: acinetobacter lwoffi ln1, staphylococcus epidermidis ln2, clostridium perfringens ln3, plectridium anatum ln4, streptococcus bovis ln5, enterobacter cloacae ln6, corynebacterium sp ln7. the eighth strain was purposely administered to the child in order to take advantage of an antagonism between this strain and spontaneously acquired flora. this strain is bacillus licheniformis fd1. the gnotoxenic mice proved to be a good experimental model because we found their bacterial equilibrium comparable to that observed in child l.n. in addition, we studied the decontamination procedures of the gastrointestinal tract of mice by observing both the antagonism of b. licheniformis with bacitracin, and the action of a suitable mixture of antibiotics. conditions for the realization of this decontamination are discussed in this study.
