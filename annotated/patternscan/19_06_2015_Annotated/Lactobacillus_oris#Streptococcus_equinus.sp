TI  == isolation and characterization of the microflora of nixtamalized corn masa.
AB  == corn tortillas are a staple in the diet among the mexican population, and are traditionally produced through a process known as nixtamalization. this traditional process involves steeping whole-kernel corn in an alkaline solution overnight and then grinding the corn into dough (masa), which is then baked. while the masa is held before baking, significant microbial change can occur which leads to fermentation and spoilage. the objective of this research was to characterize and identify the microflora of nixtamalized corn masa from six different commercial tortilla mills throughout guadalajara, mexico. the identification of samples was conducted using the microbial identification system (mis), which analyzes cellular fatty acids via gas chromatography to identify bacterial species. lactic acid bacteria and aerobic mesophiles were the predominant organisms, with both groups having counts ranging from 10(4) to 10(7)cfu/g across all mills. coliform populations were observed at counts of 10(2) to 10(3)cfu/g, while yeast and mold counts were typically less than 10(1)cfu/g. some mills showed no presence of coliforms or yeast or mold. streptococcus bovis and lactobacillus oris were isolated from all mills, and were the most prevalent organisms representing 43% and 17% of all lactic acid bacteria isolated, respectively. s. bovis was also isolated on the aerobic tryptic soy plates and was the most prevalent species representing 19% of the total organisms from these aerobic plates.
