TI  == construction of allitol synthesis pathway by multi-enzyme coexpression in escherichia coli and its application in allitol production.
AB  == an engineered strain for the conversion of d-fructose to allitol was developed by constructing a multi-enzyme coupling pathway and cofactor recycling system in escherichia coli. d-psicose-3-epimerase from ruminococcus sp. and ribitol dehydrogenase from klebsiella oxytoca were coexpressed to form the multi-enzyme coupling pathway for allitol production. the cofactor recycling system was constructed using the formate dehydrogenase gene from candida methylica for continuous nadh supply. the recombinant strain produced 10.62 g/l allitol from 100 mm d-fructose. to increase the intracellular concentration of the substrate,  the glucose/fructose facilitator gene from zymomonas mobilis was incorporated into the engineered strain. the results showed that the allitol yield was enhanced significantly to 16.53 g/l with a conversion rate of 92 %. through optimizing conversion conditions, allitol was produced effectively on a large scale by the whole-cell biotransformation system; the yield reached 48.62 g/l when 500 mm d-fructose was used as the substrate.

TI  == [progress on engineered strains for ethanol production].
AB  == with the 21 century's coming, the era of cheap oil is coming to the end. there has been an increasing worldwide interest in fuel ethanol. in the last two decades, lots of work has been done to develop strains for ethanol producing. research progress on metabolic engineering of strains for fuel ethanol production is summarized, including genetically engineered saccharomyces cerevisiae to utilize starch, pentose and cellulose, zymomonas mobilis to ferment arabinose and xylose, escherichia coli and klebsiella oxytoca to introduce heterogenous ethanol production pathway. the aim of engineering these strains is to obtain an ideal microorganism which can converse the available carbon sources to ethanol rapidly  and efficiently with high tolerance to ethanol and to inhibitory components in the cheap materials such as lignocellulose hydrolysate. the importance of fuel ethanol will be a stimulus to develop engineered hardy strains to utilize cheap materials for high ethanol concentration production. since both saccharomyces cerevisiae and zymomonas mobilis are generally regarded as safe (gras), genetically engineered saccharomyces cerevisiae which can utilize raw starch directly and recombinant zymomonas mobilis which can ferment glucose, arabinose and xylose in the lignocellulose hydrolysate have potential application to industry in the near future.

TI  == bacteria engineered for fuel ethanol production: current status.
AB  == the lack of industrially suitable microorganisms for converting biomass into fuel ethanol has traditionally been cited as a major technical roadblock to developing a bioethanol industry. in the last two decades, numerous microorganisms have been engineered to selectively produce ethanol. lignocellulosic biomass contains complex carbohydrates that necessitate utilizing microorganisms capable of fermenting sugars not fermentable by brewers' yeast. the most significant of these is xylose. the greatest successes have been in the engineering of gram-negative bacteria: escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, and zymomonas mobilis. e. coli and k. oxytoca are naturally able to use a wide spectrum of sugars, and work has concentrated on engineering these strains to selectively produce ethanol. z. mobilis produces ethanol at high yields, but ferments only glucose and fructose. work on this organism has concentrated on introducing pathways for the fermentation of arabinose and xylose. the history of constructing these strains and current progress in refining them are detailed in  this review.

TI  == evaluation of a recombinant klebsiella oxytoca strain for ethanol production from cellulose by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation: comparison with native cellobiose-utilising yeast strains and performance in co-culture with thermotolerant yeast and zymomonas mobilis.
AB  == in the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation to ethanol of 100 g l(-1) microcrystalline cellulose, the cellobiose-fermenting recombinant klebsiella oxytoca p2 outperformed a range of cellobiose-fermenting yeasts used in earlier work, despite producing less ethanol than reported earlier for this organism under similar conditions. the time taken by k. oxytoca p2 to produce up to about  33 g l(-1) ethanol was much less than for any other organism investigated, including ethanol-tolerant strains of saccharomyces pastorianus, kluyveromyces marxianus and zymomonas mobilis. ultimately, it produced slightly less ethanol (maximum 36 g l(-1)) than these organisms, reflecting its lower ethanol tolerance. significant advantages were obtained by co-culturing k. oxytoca p2 with s. pastorianus, k. marxianus or z. mobilis, either isothermally, or in conjunction with temperature-profiling to raise the cellulase activity. co-cultures produced significantly more ethanol, more rapidly, than either of the constituent strains in pure culture at the same inoculum density. k. oxytoca p2 dominated the early stages of the co-cultures, with ethanol production in the later stages due principally to the more ethanol tolerant strain. the usefulness  of k. oxytoca p2 in cellulose simultaneous saccharification and fermentation should be improved by mutation of the strain to increase its ethanol tolerance.

TI  == gene integration and expression and extracellular secretion of erwinia chrysanthemi endoglucanase cely (cely) and celz (celz) in ethanologenic klebsiella oxytoca p2.
AB  == the development of methods to reduce costs associated with the solubilization of  cellulose is essential for the utilization of lignocellulose as a renewable feedstock for fuels and chemicals. one promising approach is the genetic engineering of ethanol-producing microorganisms that also produce cellulase enzymes during fermentation. by starting with an ethanologenic derivative (strain p2) of klebsiella oxytoca m5a1 with the native ability to metabolize cellobiose,  the need for supplemental beta-glucosidase was previously eliminated. in the current study, this approach has been extended by adding genes encoding endoglucanase activities. genes cely and celz from erwinia chrysanthemi have been functionally integrated into the chromosome of p2 using surrogate promoters from  zymomonas mobilis for expression. both were secreted into the extracellular milieu, producing more than 20,000 endoglucanase units (carboxymethyl cellulase activity) per liter of fermentation broth. during the fermentation of crystalline cellulose with low levels of commercial cellulases of fungal origin, these new strains produced up to 22% more ethanol than unmodified p2. most of the beneficial contribution was attributed to cely rather than to celz. these results suggest that fungal enzymes with substrate profiles resembling cely (preference for long-chain polymers and lack of activity on soluble cello-oligosaccharides of two to five glucosyl residues) may be limiting in commercial cellulase preparations.

TI  == enteric bacterial catalysts for fuel ethanol production.
AB  == the technology is available to produce fuel ethanol from renewable lignocellulosic biomass. the current challenge is to assemble the various process options into a commercial venture and begin the task of incremental improvement.  current process designs for lignocellulose are far more complex than grain to ethanol processes. this complexity results in part from the complexity of the substrate and the biological limitations of the catalyst. our work at the university of florida has focused primarily on the genetic engineering of enteric bacteria using genes encoding zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase. these two genes have been assembled into a portable ethanol production cassette, the pet operon, and integrated into the chromosome of escherichia coli b for use with hemicellulose-derived syrups. the resulting strain, ko11, produces ethanol efficiently from all hexose and pentose sugars present in the polymers of hemicellulose. by using the same approach, we integrated the pet operon into the chromosome of klebsiella oxytoca to produce strain p2 for use in the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (ssf) process for cellulose. strain p2 has the native ability to ferment cellobiose and cellotriose, eliminating the need for one class of cellulase enzymes. recently, the ability to produce and secrete high levels of endoglucanase has also been added to strain p2, further reducing the requirement for fungal cellulase. the general approach for the genetic engineering of new biocatalysts using the pet operon has been most successful with enteric bacteria but was also extended to gram positive bacteria, which have other useful traits for lignocellulose conversion. many opportunities remain for further improvements in these biocatalysts as we proceed toward the development of single organisms that can be used for the efficient fermentation of both hemicellulosic and cellulosic substrates.

TI  == engineering endoglucanase-secreting strains of ethanologenic klebsiella oxytoca p2.
AB  == recombinant klebsiella oxytoca p2 was developed as a biocatalyst for the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (ssf) of cellulose by chromosomally integrating zymomonas mobilis genes (pdc, adhb) encoding the ethanol pathway. this strain contains the native ability to transport and metabolize cellobiose, eliminating the need to supplement with beta-glucosidase during ssf. to increase the utility of this biocatalyst, we have now chromosomally integrated the celz gene encoding the primary endoglucanase from erwinia chrysanthemi. this gene was expressed at high levels by replacing the native promoter with a surrogate promoter derived from z. mobilis dna. with the addition of out genes encoding the type ii protein secretion system from e. chrysanthemi, over half of the active endoglucanase (egz) was secreted into the extracellular environment. the two most active strains, sz2(pcpp2006) and sz6(pcpp2006), produced approximately 24 000 iu l-1 of cmcase activity, equivalent to 5% of total cellular protein. recombinant egz partially depolymerized acid-swollen cellulose and allowed the production of small amounts  of ethanol by sz6(pcpp2006) without the addition of fungal cellulase. however, additional endoglucanase activities will be required to complete the depolymerization of cellulose into small soluble products which can be efficiently metabolized to ethanol.

TI  == metabolic engineering of bacteria for ethanol production
AB  == technologies are available which will allow the conversion of lignocellulose into fuel ethanol using genetically engineered bacteria. assembling these into a cost-effective process remains a challenge. our work has focused primarily on the genetic engineering of enteric bacteria using a portable ethanol production pathway. genes encoding zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase have been integrated into the chromosome of escherichia coli b to produce strain ko11 for the fermentation of hemicellulose-derived syrups. this organism can efficiently ferment all hexose and pentose sugars present in the polymers of hemicellulose. klebsiella oxytoca m5a1 has been genetically engineered in a similar manner to produce strain p2 for ethanol production from cellulose. this organism has the native ability to ferment cellobiose and cellotriose, eliminating the need for one class of cellulase enzymes. the optimal ph for cellulose fermentation with this organism (ph 5.0-5.5) is near that of fungal cellulases. the general approach for the genetic engineering of new biocatalysts has been most successful with enteric bacteria thus far. however, this approach may also prove useful with gram-positive bacteria which have other  important traits for lignocellulose conversion. many opportunities remain for further improvements in the biomass to ethanol processes. these include the development of enzyme-based systems which eliminate the need for dilute acid hydrolysis or other pretreatments, improvements in existing pretreatments for enzymatic hydrolysis, process improvements to increase the effective use of cellulase and hemicellulase enzymes, improvements in rates of ethanol production, decreased nutrient costs, increases in ethanol concentrations achieved in biomass beers, increased resistance of the biocatalysts to lignocellulosic-derived toxins, etc. to be useful, each of these improvements must result in a decrease in the cost for ethanol production. copyright 1998 john wiley & sons, inc.

TI  == isolation and molecular characterization of high-performance cellobiose-fermenting spontaneous mutants of ethanologenic escherichia coli ko11  containing the klebsiella oxytoca casab operon.
AB  == escherichia coli ko11 was previously constructed to produce ethanol from acid hydrolysates of hemicellulose (pentoses and hexoses) by the chromosomal integration of zymomonas mobilis genes encoding pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) and  alcohol dehydrogenase (adhb). klebsiella oxytoca p2 was constructed in an analogous fashion for the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of cellulose and contains pts enzymes for cellobiose. in this study, ko11 was further engineered for the fermentation of cellulose by adding the k. oxytoca casab genes encoding enzyme iicellobiose and phospho-beta-glucosidase. although the two k. oxytoca genes were well expressed in cloning hosts such as dh5 alpha,  both were expressed poorly in e. coli ko11, a derivative of e. coli b. spontaneous mutants which exhibited more than 15-fold-higher specific activities  for cellobiose metabolism were isolated. the mutations of these mutants resided in the plasmid rather than the host. three mutants were characterized by sequence analysis. all contained similar internal deletions which eliminated the casab promoter and operator regions and placed the lacz shine-dalgarno region immediately upstream from the casa shine-dalgarno region. ko11 harboring mutant plasmids (ploi1908, ploi1909, or ploi1910) rapidly fermented cellobiose to ethanol, and the yield was more than 90% of the theoretical yield. two of these strains were used with commercial cellulase to ferment mixed-waste office paper to ethanol.

TI  == extracellular melibiose and fructose are intermediates in raffinose catabolism during fermentation to ethanol by engineered enteric bacteria.
AB  == contrary to general concepts of bacterial saccharide metabolism, melibiose (25 to 32 g/liter) and fructose (5 to 14 g/liter) accumulated as extracellular intermediates during the catabolism of raffinose (o-alpha-d-galactopyranosyl-1, 6-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl-beta-d-fructofuranoside) (90 g/liter) by ethanologenic recombinants of escherichia coli b, klebsiella oxytoca m5a1, and erwinia chrysanthemi ec16. both hydrolysis products (melibiose and fructose) were subsequently transported and further metabolized by all three organisms. raffinose catabolism was initiated by beta-fructosidase; melibiose was subsequently hydrolyzed to galactose and glucose by alpha-galactosidase. glucose  and fructose were completely metabolized by all three organisms, but galactose accumulated in the fermentation broth with ec16(ploi555) and p2. mm2 (a raffinose-positive e. coli mutant) was the most effective biocatalyst for ethanol production (38 g/liter) from raffinose. all organisms rapidly fermented sucrose (90 g/liter) to ethanol (48 g/liter) at more than 90% of the theoretical yield. during sucrose catabolism, both hydrolysis products (glucose and fructose) were metabolized concurrently by ec16(ploi555) and p2 without sugar leakage. however,  fructose accumulated extracellularly (27 to 28 g/liter) at early stages of fermentation with ko11 and mm2. sequential utilization of glucose and fructose correlated with a diauxie in base utilization (ph maintenance). the mechanism of  sugar escape remains unknown but may involve downhill leakage via permease which  transports precursor saccharides or novel sugar export proteins. if sugar escape  occurs in nature with wild organisms, it could facilitate the development of complex bacterial communities which are based on the sequence of saccharide catabolism and the hierarchy of sugar utilization.

TI  == saccharification and fermentation of sugar cane bagasse by klebsiella oxytoca p2  containing chromosomally integrated genes encoding the zymomonas mobilis ethanol  pathway.
AB  == pretreatment of sugar cane bagasse is essential for a simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (ssf) process which uses recombinant klebsiella oxytoca strain p2 and genencor spezyme ce. strain p2 has been genetically engineered to express zymomonas mobilis genes encoding the ethanol pathway and retains the native ability to transport and metabolize cellobiose (minimizing the need for extracellular cellobiase). in ssf studies with this organism, both the rate of ethanol production and ethanol yield were limited by saccharification at  10 and 20 filter papaer units (fpu) g(-1) acid-treated bagasse. dilute slurries of biomass were converted to ethanol more efficiently (over 72% of theoretical yield) in simple batch fermentations than slurries containing high solids albeit  with the production of lower levels of ethanol. with high solids (i.e., 160 g acid-treated bagasse l(-1)), a combination of 20 fpu cellulase g(-1) bagasse, preincubation under saccharification conditions, and additional grinding (to reduce particle size) were required to produce ca. 40 g ethanol l(-1). alternatively, almost 40 g ethanol l(-1) was produced with 10 fpu cellulase g(-1) bagasse by incorporating a second saccharification step (no further enzyme addition) followed by a second inoculation and short fermentation. in this way, a theoretical ethanol yield of over 70% was achieved with the production of 20 g ethanol 800 fpu(-1) of commercial cellulase.

TI  == ethanol production from cellobiose, amorphous cellulose, and crystalline cellulose by recombinant klebsiella oxytoca containing chromosomally integrated zymomonas mobilis genes for ethanol production and plasmids expressing thermostable cellulase genes from clostridium thermocellum.
AB  == the zymomonas mobilis genes for ethanol production have been integrated into the  chromosome of klebsiella oxytoca m5a1. the best of these constructs, strain p2, produced ethanol efficiently from cellobiose in addition to monomeric sugars. utilization of cellobiose and cellotriose by this strain eliminated the requirement for external beta-glucosidase and reduced the amount of commercial cellulase needed to ferment solka floc sw40 (primarily crystalline cellulose). the addition of plasmids encoding endoglucanases from clostridium thermocellum resulted in the intracellular accumulation of thermostable enzymes as coproducts  with ethanol during fermentation. the best of these, strain p2(pct603t) containing celd, was used to hydrolyze amorphous cellulose to cellobiose and produce ethanol in a two-stage process. strain p2(pct603t) was also tested in combination with commercial cellulases. pretreatment of solka floc sw40 at 60 degrees c with endoglucanase d substantially reduced the amount of commercial cellulase required to ferment solka floc. the stimulatory effect of the endoglucanase d pretreatment may result from the hydrolysis of amorphous regions, exposing additional sites for attack by fungal cellulases. since endoglucanase d  functions as part of a complex in c. thermocellum, it is possible that this enzyme may complex with fungal enzymes or bind cellulose to produce a more open structure for hydrolysis.

TI  == metabolic engineering of klebsiella oxytoca m5a1 for ethanol production from xylose and glucose.
AB  == the efficient diversion of pyruvate from normal fermentative pathways to ethanol  production in klebsiella oxytoca m5a1 requires the expression of zymomonas mobilis genes encoding both pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase. final ethanol concentrations obtained with the best recombinant, strain m5a1 (ploi555), were in excess of 40 g/liter with an efficiency of 0.48 g of ethanol (xylose) and 0.50 g of ethanol (glucose) per g of sugar, as compared with a theoretical maximum of 0.51 g of ethanol per g of sugar. the maximal volumetric productivity per hour for both sugars was 2.0 g/liter. this volumetric productivity with xylose is almost twice that previously obtained with ethanologenic escherichia coli. succinate was also produced as a minor product during fermentation.
