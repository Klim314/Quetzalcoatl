TI  == inhibition of bacillus cereus strains by antimicrobial metabolites from lactobacillus johnsonii crl1647 and enterococcus faecium sm21.
AB  == bacillus cereus is an endospore-forming, gram-positive bacterium able to cause foodborne diseases. lactic acid bacteria (lab) are known for their ability to synthesize organic acids and bacteriocins, but the potential of these compounds against b. cereus has been scarcely documented in food models. the present study  has examined the effect of the metabolites produced by lactobacillus johnsonii crl1647 and enterococcus faecium sm21 on the viability of select b. cereus strains. furthermore, the effect of e. faecium sm21 metabolites against b. cereus strains has also been investigated on a rice food model. l. johnsonii crl1647 produced 128 mmol/l of lactic acid, 38 mmol/l of acetic acid and 0.3 mmol/l of phenyl-lactic acid. these organic acids reduced the number of vegetative cells and spores of the b. cereus strains tested. however, the antagonistic effect disappeared at ph 6.5. on the other hand, e. faecium sm21 produced only lactic and acetic acid (24.5 and 12.2 mmol/l, respectively) and was able to inhibit both vegetative cells and spores of the b. cereus strains, at a final fermentation ph  of 5.0 and at ph 6.5. this would indicate the action of other metabolites, different from organic acids, present in the cell-free supernatant. on cooked rice grains, the e. faecium sm21 bacteriocin(s) were tested against two b. cereus strains. both of them were significantly affected within the first 4 h of contact; whereas b. cereus bac1 cells recovered after 24 h, the effect on b. cereus 1 remained up to the end of the assay. the lab studied may thus be considered to define future strategies for biological control of b. cereus.

TI  == characterization of lactobacillus spp. isolated from the feces of breast-feeding  piglets.
AB  == lactobacillus spp., referred to as ij-1 and ij-2, were isolated from the feces of breast-feeding piglets and analyzed for probiotic properties. according to the analyses of 16s rdna sequence, lactobacillus sp. ij-1 showed greater than 99% homology with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 20016(t), and lactobacillus sp. ij-2 had  greater than 99% homology with the l. gasseri atcc 33323(t) and l. johnsonii atcc 33200(t). the ph changes in the culture media of lactobacillus sp. ij-1 and lactobacillus sp. ij-2 were from 6.5 to 4.2 and 4.6, respectively. their respective resistance against artificial gastric acid and artificial bile acid led to survival rates of nearly 186+/-44% and 13+/-5%. neither strain produced the carcinogenic enzyme beta-glucuronidase. both strains inhibited the growth of  pathogenic microorganisms, such as listeria monocytogenes atcc 19111, salmonella  enterica kctc 12401, salmonella enteritidis atcc 13076, staphylococcus aureus kctc 3881, and bacillus cereus 3711, within 24 h of growth.
