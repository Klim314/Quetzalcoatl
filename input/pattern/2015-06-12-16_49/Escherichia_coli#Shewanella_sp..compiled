TI  - Comprehensive characterization of sphingolipid ceramide N-deacylase for the synthesis and fatty acid remodeling of glycosphingolipids.
AB  - Sphingolipid ceramide N-deacylase (SCDase) catalyzes reversible reactions in which the amide linkage in glycosphingolipids is hydrolyzed or synthesized. While SCDases show great value for the enzymatic synthesis of glycosphingolipids, they are relatively poorly characterized enzymes. In this work, the enzymatic properties of SCDase from Shewanella alga G8 (SA_SCD) were systematically characterized and compared with the commercially available SCDase from Pseudomonas sp. TK4 (PS_SCD). The optimal pH values for the hydrolytic and synthetic activity of SA_SCD were pH 6.0 and pH 7.5, respectively. Both activities were strongly inhibited by Zn2+ and Cu2+, while Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ promoted the hydrolytic activity but inhibited the synthetic activity. SA_SCD showed very broad substrate specificity both in hydrolysis and synthesis. Importantly, SA_SCD has a broader specificity for acyl donor acceptance than does PS_SCD, especially for unsaturated fatty acids and fatty acids with very short or long acyl chains. Further kinetic analysis revealed that the k cat/K M value for the hydrolytic activity of SA_SCD was 8.9-fold higher than that of PS_SCD for GM1a, while the values for the synthetic activity were 38-fold higher for stearic acid and 23-fold higher for lyso-GM1a (d18:1) than those of PS_SCD, respectively. The broad fatty acid specificity and high catalytic efficiency, together with the ease of expression of SA_SCD in Escherichia coli, make it a better biocatalyst than is PS_SCD for the synthesis and structural remodeling of glycosphingolipids.
TI  - Purification of a secreted lectin from Andrias davidianus skin and its antibacterial activity.
AB  - A lectin secreted from Andrias davidianus skin (ADL) was purified by affinity chromatography on porcine stomach mucin (type III) (PSM)-crosslinked albumin, followed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 and HPLC on TSK gel G3000PWXL. The purified lectin was found to be a dimeric protein, as revealed by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF analysis. SDS-PAGE showed that the ADL protein had a molecular mass of 17 kDa. ADL produced an 8.5 kDa band when examined using SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. ADL agglutinated native and trypsinized human B erythrocytes. The hemagglutination activity was inhibited by glycoproteins, such as PSM and asialo-PSM, but not by any of the monosaccharides tested. The activity was stable between 4 degrees C and 50 degrees C. Significant ADL activity was observed between pH 4-5. The lectin reaction did not depend on the presence of the divalent cation Ca2+ or Mg2+. The N-terminal ADL sequence was determined to be VGYTVGATPM. The lectin exhibited antibacterial activity, involving growth and respiration inhibition in Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Shewanella sp. Furthermore, ADL showed inhibition activity against the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These findings suggest that ADL plays an important role in the innate immunity of A. davidianus on the body surface.
TI  - Cloning, overexpression and characterization of a new oligoalginate lyase from a  marine bacterium, Shewanella sp.
AB  - PURPOSE OF WORK: Is to report an oligoalginate lyase with high enzymatic activity and high-level expression. Using site-finding PCR and degenerate PCR, a gene (designated oalS17) encoding a new oligoalginate lyase was cloned from Shewanella sp. Kz7 and expressed in Escherichia coli. The gene consisted of 2,292 bp with deduced amino acid size of 763 including a putative signal peptide of 44 amino acid residues belonging to polysaccharide lyase (PL) family 17. The recombinant protein was most active at 50 degrees C and pH 6.2 in 50 mM phosphate buffer. It degraded alginate more efficiently than polyM and polyG block into a monomeric sugar acid, with a specific activity of 32 U mg(-1) toward alginate, 24 U mg(-1) toward polyM and 5 U mg(-1) toward polyG. With the high-level expression and high enzymatic activity, the recombinant oligoalginate lyase OalS17 could be a potential enzyme for further research on alginate saccharification and biofuels production.
TI  - Cold adaptation: structural and functional characterizations of psychrophilic and mesophilic acetate kinase.
AB  - Acetate kinase catalyzes the reversible magnesium-dependent phosphoryl transfer from ATP to acetate to form acetyl phosphate and ADP. Here, we report functional and some structural properties of cold-adapted psychrotrophic enzyme; acetate kinase with those from mesophilic counterpart in Escherichia coli K-12. Recombinant acetate kinase from Shewanella sp. AS-11 (SAK) and E. coli K-12 (EAK) were purified to homogeneity following affinity chromatography and followed by Super Q column chromatography as reported before [44]. Both purified enzymes are shared some of the common properties such as (similar molecular mass, amino acid sequence and similar optimum pH), but characterized shift in the apparent optimum temperature of specific activity to lower temperature as well as by a lower thermal stability compared with EAK. The functional comparisons reveal that SAK is a cold adapted enzyme, having a higher affinity to acetate than EAK. In the acetyl phosphate and ADP-forming direction, the catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) for acetate was 8.0 times higher for SAK than EAK at 10 degrees C. The activity ratio of SAK to EAK was increased with decreasing temperature in both of the forward and backward reactions. Furthermore, the activation energy, enthalpy and entropy in both reaction directions that catalyzed by SAK were lower than those catalyzed by EAK. The model structure of SAK showed the significantly reduced numbers of salt bridges and cation-pi interactions as compared with EAK. These results suggest that weakening of intramolecular electrostatic interactions of SAK is involved in a more flexible structure which is likely to be responsible for its cold adaptation.
TI  - Antioxidant and antimicrobial potential of the Bifurcaria bifurcata epiphytic bacteria.
AB  - Surface-associated marine bacteria are an interesting source of new secondary metabolites. The aim of this study was the isolation and identification of epiphytic bacteria from the marine brown alga, Bifurcaria bifurcata, and the evaluation of the antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of bacteria extracts. The identification of epiphytic bacteria was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Bacteria extracts were obtained with methanol and dichloromethane (1:1) extraction. The antioxidant activity of extracts was performed by quantification of total phenolic content (TPC), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). Antimicrobial activities were evaluated against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans. A total of 39 Bifurcaria bifurcata-associated bacteria were isolated and 33 were identified as Vibrio sp. (48.72%), Alteromonas sp. (12.82%), Shewanella sp. (12.26%), Serratia sp. (2.56%), Citricoccus sp. (2.56%), Cellulophaga sp. (2.56%), Ruegeria sp. (2.56%) and Staphylococcus sp. (2.56%). Six (15.38%) of the 39 bacteria Bifurcaria bifurcata-associated bacteria presented less than a 90% Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) match, and some of those could be new. The highest antioxidant activity and antimicrobial activity (against B. subtilis) was exhibited by strain 16 (Shewanella sp.). Several strains also presented high antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, mainly belonging to Alteromonas sp. and Vibrio sp. There were no positive results against fungi and Gram-negative bacteria. Bifurcaria bifurcata epiphytic bacteria were revealed to be excellent sources of natural antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds.
TI  - Tolerance of anaerobic bacteria to chlorinated solvents.
AB  - The aim of this research was to evaluate the effects of four chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs), perchloroethene (PCE), carbon tetrachloride (CT), chloroform (CF) and 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA), on the growth of eight anaerobic bacteria: four fermentative species (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Clostridium sp. and Paenibacillus sp.) and four respiring species (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Geobacter sulfurreducens, Shewanella oneidensis and Desulfovibrio vulgaris). Effective concentrations of solvents which inhibited growth rates by 50% (EC50) were determined. The octanol-water partition coefficient or log Po/w of a CAH proved a generally satisfactory measure of its toxicity. Most species tolerated approximately 3-fold and 10-fold higher concentrations of the two relatively more polar CAHs CF and 1,2-DCA, respectively, than the two relatively less polar compounds PCE and CT. EC50 values correlated well with growth rates observed in solvent-free cultures, with fast-growing organisms displaying higher tolerance levels. Overall, fermentative bacteria were more tolerant to CAHs than respiring species, with iron- and sulfate-reducing bacteria in particular appearing highly sensitive to CAHs. These data extend the current understanding of the impact of CAHs on a range of anaerobic bacteria, which will benefit the field of bioremediation.
TI  - Expression, purification, and characterization of cold-adapted inorganic pyrophosphatase from psychrophilic Shewanella sp. AS-11.
AB  - In the presence of divalent cations, inorganic pyrophosphatase is activated to hydrolyze inorganic pyrophosphate to inorganic phosphate. Here, we clone, express, purify, and characterize inorganic pyrophosphatase from the psychrophilic Shewanella sp. AS-11 (Sh-PPase). The recombinant Sh-PPase was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) at 20 degrees C using pET16b as an expression vector and purified from the cell extracts by a combination of ammonium sulfate fractionation and anion-exchange chromatography. Sh-PPase was found to be a family II PPase with a subunit molecular mass of 34 kD that preferentially utilizes Mn(2)(+) over Mg(2)(+) ions for activity. The functional characteristics of Sh-PPase, such as activity, temperature dependency, and thermal inactivation, were greatly influenced by manganese ions. Manganese ion activation increased the enzyme's activity at low temperatures; therefore, it was required to gain the cold-adapted characteristics of Sh-PPase.
TI  - Changes in translational efficiency is a dominant regulatory mechanism in the environmental response of bacteria.
AB  - To understand how cell physiological state affects mRNA translation, we used Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 grown under steady state conditions at either 20% or 8.5% O2. Using a combination of quantitative proteomics and RNA-Seq, we generated high-confidence data on >1000 mRNA and protein pairs. By using a steady state model, we found that differences in protein-mRNA ratios were primarily due to differences in the translational efficiency of specific genes. When oxygen levels were lowered, 28% of the proteins showed at least a 2-fold change in expression. Transcription levels were sp. significantly altered for 26% of the protein changes; translational efficiency was significantly altered for 46% and a combination of both was responsible for the remaining 28%. Changes in translational efficiency were significantly correlated with the codon usage pattern of the genes and measurable tRNA pools changed in response to altered O2 levels. Our results suggest that changes in the translational efficiency of proteins, in part due to altered tRNA pools, is a major determinant of regulated alterations in protein expression levels in bacteria.
TI  - N-acetylgalactosamine utilization pathway and regulon in proteobacteria: genomic  reconstruction and experimental characterization in Shewanella.
AB  - We used a comparative genomics approach to reconstruct the N-acetyl-d-galactosamine (GalNAc) and galactosamine (GalN) utilization pathways and transcriptional regulons in Proteobacteria. The reconstructed GalNAc/GalN utilization pathways include multiple novel genes with specific functional roles. Most of the pathway variations were attributed to the amino sugar transport, phosphorylation, and deacetylation steps, whereas the downstream catabolic enzymes in the pathway were largely conserved. The predicted GalNAc kinase AgaK, the novel variant of GalNAc-6-phosphate deacetylase AgaA(II) and the GalN-6-phosphate deaminase AgaS from Shewanella sp. ANA-3 were validated in vitro using individual enzymatic assays and reconstitution of the three-step pathway. By using genetic techniques, we confirmed that AgaS but not AgaI functions as the main GalN-6-P deaminase in the GalNAc/GalN utilization pathway in Escherichia coli. Regulons controlled by AgaR repressors were reconstructed by bioinformatics in most proteobacterial genomes encoding GalNAc pathways. Candidate AgaR-binding motifs share a common sequence with consensus CTTTC that was found in multiple copies and arrangements in regulatory regions of aga genes. This study provides comprehensive insights into the common and distinctive features of the GalNAc/GalN catabolism and its regulation in diverse Proteobacteria.
TI  - Fluorescence studies on the stability, flexibility and substrate-induced conformational changes of acetate kinases from psychrophilic and mesophilic bacteria.
AB  - The acetate kinase from the Antarctic psychrophilic Shewanella sp. AS-11 (SAK) has a significantly higher catalytic efficiency at low temperatures when compared with that from mesophilic Escherichia coli K-12 (EAK). To examine the stability and conformational flexibility of SAK and EAK, steady state intrinsic fluorescence studies were performed. EAK contains only one Trp at a position 46, while SAK contains two Trps at positions 46 and 388. From the fluorescence emission spectra, quenching with acrylamide, Cs(+) and I(-) at different temperatures and denaturation with guanidine-HCl, it was revealed that the SAK bears more flexible and unstable structure than that of EAK. Substrate-induced conformational changes reflect that SAK reached transition state through more conformational changes than EAK. In combination of our thermodynamic studies on the enzymatic reaction and present research findings, it can be concluded that these structural features of SAK may contribute to its high catalytic efficiency at low temperatures.
TI  - Coastal seawater bacteria harbor a large reservoir of plasmid-mediated quinolone  resistance determinants in Jiaozhou Bay, China.
AB  - Diversity and prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants were investigated in environmental bacteria isolated from surface seawater of Jiaozhou Bay, China. Five qnr gene alleles were identified in 34 isolates by PCR amplification, including qnrA3 gene in a Shewanella algae isolate, qnrB9 gene in a Citrobacter freundii isolate, qnrD gene in 22 Proteus vulgaris isolates, qnrS1 gene in 1 Enterobacter sp. and 4 Klebsiella spp. isolates, and qnrS2 gene in 1 Pseudomonas sp. and 4 Pseudoalteromonas sp. isolates. The qnrC, aac(6')-Ib-cr, and qepA genes could not be detected in this study. The 22 qnrD-positive Proteus vulgaris isolates could be differentiated into four genotypes based on ERIC-PCR assay. The qnrS1 and qnrD genes could be transferred to Escherichia coli J53 Azi(R) or E. coli TOP10 recipient strains using conjugation or transformation methods. Among the 34 qnr-positive isolates, 30 had a single point mutation in the QRDRs of GyrA protein (Ala67Ser, Ser83Ile, or Ser83Thr), indicating that cooperation of chromosome- and plasmid-mediated resistance contributed to the spread and evolution of quinolone resistance in this coastal bay. Eighty-five percent of the isolates were also found to be resistant to ampicillin, and bla(CMY), bla(OXY), bla(SHV), and bla(TEM) genes were detected in five isolates that also harbored the qnrB9 or qnrS1 gene. Our current study is the first identification of qnrS2 gene in Pseudoalteromonas and Pseudomonas strains, and qnrD gene in Proteus vulgaris strains. High prevalence of diverse qnr genes in Jiaozhou Bay indicates that coastal seawater may serve as an important reservoir, natural source, and dissemination vehicle of quinolone resistance determinants.
TI  - The acid-tolerant L-arabinose isomerase from the mesophilic Shewanella sp. ANA-3  is highly active at low temperatures.
AB  - BACKGROUND: L-arabinose isomerases catalyse the isomerization of L-arabinose into L-ribulose at insight biological systems. At industrial scale of this enzyme is used for the bioconversion of D-galactose into D-tagatose which has many applications in pharmaceutical and agro-food industries. The isomerization reaction is thermodynamically equilibrated, and therefore the bioconversion rates is shifted towards tagatose when the temperature is increased. Moreover, to prevent secondary reactions it will be of interest to operate at low pH. The profitability of this D-tagatose production process is mainly related to the use of lactose as cheaper raw material. In many dairy products it will be interesting to produce D-tagatose during storage. This requires an efficient L-arabinose isomerase acting at low temperature and pH values. RESULTS: The gene encoding the L-arabinose isomerase from Shewanella sp. ANA-3 was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The purified protein has a tetrameric arrangement composed by four identical 55 kDa subunits. The biochemical characterization of this enzyme showed that it was distinguishable by its maximal activity at low temperatures comprised between 15-35 degrees C. Interestingly, this biocatalyst preserves more than 85% of its activity in a broad range of temperatures from 4.0 to 45 degrees C. Shewanella sp. ANA-3 L-arabinose isomerase was also optimally active at pH 5.5-6.5 and maintained over 80% of its activity at large pH values from 4.0 to 8.5. Furthermore, this enzyme exhibited a weak requirement for metallic ions for its activity evaluated at 0.6 mM Mn2+. Stability studies showed that this protein is highly stable mainly at low temperature and pH values. Remarkably, T268K mutation clearly enhances the enzyme stability at low pH values. Use of this L-arabinose isomerase for D-tagatose production allows the achievement of attractive bioconversion rates of 16% at 4 degrees C and 34% at 35 degrees C. CONCLUSIONS: Here we reported the purification and the biochemical characterization of the novel Shewanella sp. ANA-3 L-arabinose isomerase. Determination of the biochemical properties demonstrated that this enzyme was highly active at low temperatures. The generated T268K mutant displays an increase of the enzyme stability essentially at low pH. These features seem to be very attractive for the bioconversion of D-galactose into D-tagatose at low temperature which is very interesting from industrial point of view.
TI  - Identification and characterization of alkaline serine protease from goat skin surface metagenome.
AB  - Metagenomic DNA isolated from goat skin surface was used to construct plasmid DNA library in Escherichia coli DH10B. Recombinant clones were screened for functional protease activity on skim milk agar plates. Upon screening 70,000 clones, a clone carrying recombinant plasmid pSP1 exhibited protease activity. In vitro transposon mutagenesis and sequencing of the insert DNA in this clone revealed an ORF of 1890 bp encoding a protein with 630 amino acids which showed significant sequence homology to the peptidase S8 and S53 subtilisin kexin sedolisin of Shewanella sp. This ORF was cloned in pET30b and expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Although the cloned Alkaline Serine protease (AS-protease) was overexpressed, it was inactive as a result of forming inclusion bodies. After solubilisation, the protease was purified using Ni-NTA chromatography and then refolded properly to retain protease activity. The purified AS-protease with a molecular mass of ~63 kDa required a divalent cation (Co2+ or Mn2+) for its improved activity. The pH and temperature optima for this protease were 10.5 and 42 degrees C respectively.
TI  - A novel low-temperature-active beta-glucosidase from symbiotic Serratia sp. TN49  reveals four essential positions for substrate accommodation.
AB  - A 2,373-bp full-length gene (bglA49) encoding a 790-residue polypeptide (BglA49)  with a calculated mass of 87.8 kDa was cloned from Serratia sp. TN49, a symbiotic bacterium isolated from the gut of longhorned beetle (Batocera horsfieldi) larvae. The deduced amino acid sequence of BglA49 showed the highest identities of 80.1% with a conceptually translated protein from Pantoea sp. At-9b (EEW02556), 38.3% with the identified glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 3 beta-glucosidase from Clostridium stercorarium NCBI 11754 (CAB08072), and <15.0% with the low-temperature-active GH 3 beta-glucosidases from Shewanella sp. G5 (ABL09836) and Paenibacillus sp. C7 (AAX35883). The recombinant enzyme (r-BglA49) was expressed in Escherichia coli and displayed the typical characteristics of low-temperature-active enzymes, such as low temperature optimum (showing apparent optimal activity at 35 degrees C), activity at low temperatures (retaining approximately 60% of its maximum activity at 20 degrees C and approximately 25% at 10 degrees C). Compared with the thermophilic GH 3 beta-glucosidase, r-BglA49 had fewer hydrogen bonds and salt bridges and less proline residues. These features might relate to the increased structure flexibility and higher catalytic activity at low temperatures of r-BglA49. The molecular docking study of four GH 3 beta-glucosidases revealed five conserved positions contributing to substrate accommodation, among which four positions of r-BglA49 (R192, Y228, D260, and E449) were identified to be essential based on site-directed mutagenesis analysis.
TI  - Crystal structure of stable protein CutA1 from psychrotrophic bacterium Shewanella sp. SIB1.
AB  - CutA1 is widely found in bacteria, plants and animals, including humans. The functions of CutA1, however, have not been well clarified. It is known that CutA1s from Pyrococcus horikoshii, Thermus thermophilus and Oryza sativa unfold at temperatures remarkably higher than the growth temperatures of the host organisms. In this work the crystal structure of CutA1 from the psychrotrophic bacterium Shewanella sp. SIB1 (SIB1-CutA1) in a trimeric form was determined at 2.7 A resolution. This is the first crystal structure of a psychrotrophic CutA1. The overall structure of SIB1-CutA1 is similar to those of CutA1 from Homo sapiens, Escherichia coli, Pyrococcus horikoshii, Thermus thermophilus, Termotoga maritima, Oryza sativa and Rattus norvergicus. A peculiarity is observed in the beta2 strand. The beta2 strand is divided into two short beta strands, beta2a and beta2b, in SIB1-CutA1. A thermal denaturation experiment revealed that SIB1-CutA1 does not unfold completely at 363 K at pH 7.0, although Shewanella sp. SIB1 cannot grow at temperatures exceeding 303 K. These results indicate that the trimeric structural motif of CutA1 is the critical factor in its unusually high stability and suggest that CutA1 needs to maintain its high stability in order to function, even in psychrotrophs.
TI  - Defensin of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha): molecular structure, in vitro expression, antimicrobial activity, and potential functions.
AB  - A 409 bp full length defensin gene was cloned and sequenced based on an expressed sequence tag (EST) obtained from a normalized zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) foot cDNA library developed in our laboratory. The D. polymorpha defensin (Dpd) gene encoded a peptide with 76 amino acid residues. The mature Dpd contains 54 amino acids with a fully functional insect defensin A domain. Homologue searching against GenBank database suggested that this Dpd was phylogenetically close to defensins from a group of insects with six conserved cysteine residues. Predicted with homology-modeling method, the three-dimensional structure of Dpd also demonstrated a significant similarity with insect defensin A. The recombinant Dpd was in vitro expressed through an Escherichia coli expression system. The antimicrobial activities of the refolded recombinant Dpd were found against the growth of Morganella sp., Plesiomonas shigelloides, Edwardsiella tarda, E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus aureus (ATCC12598) with the minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) 0.35, 0.43, 1.16, 6.46, and 30.39 microM, respectively. However, with less than 50 microM no detectable inhibition activities were observed against the other four Gram-negative bacteria (Aeromonas salmonicida salmonicida, Motile Aeromonas, Flavobacterium sp., Pseudomonas fluorescens, Shewanella putrifaciens), as well as the other Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus megaterium ATCC14581, Carnobacterium maltaromaticum ATCC27865, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC19433, and Micrococcus leteus ATCC4698), and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) of Dpd in the zebra mussel suggested that the Dpd was expressed in a variety of tissues, such as foot, retractor muscle, ctenidium, mantle, hemocytes, gonad, digestive gland, and intestine. By using the quantitative PCR, the expression level of Dpd in the zebra mussel foot was the highest, followed by the muscle. By comparing the amount of Dpd transcripts in the zebra mussel foot under two different byssogenesis conditions (byssogenesis and non-byssogenesis) with qPCR, we found that the higher expression levels of Dpd were always associated with the byssogenesis status from 2 to 4 days after the start of byssogenesis. Findings of this study suggest that the expression of the Dpd gene was upregulated in vivo by byssogeneis, and by hemocytes in vitro upon stimulation with microbial antigens.
TI  - Possible biosynthetic pathways for all cis-3,6,9,12,15,19,22, 25,28-hentriacontanonaene in bacteria.
AB  - A very long chain polyunsaturated hydrocarbon, hentriacontanonaene (C31:9), was detected in an eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-producing marine bacterium, which was isolated from the mid-latitude seashore of Hokkaido, Japan, and was tentatively identified as mesophilic Shewanella sp. strain osh08 from 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The geometry and position of the double bonds in this compound were determined physicochemically to be all cis at positions 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 19, 22, 25, and 28. Although C31:9 was detected in all of the seven EPA- or/and docosahexaenoic acid-producing bacteria tested, an EPA-deficient mutant (strain IK-1Delta8) of one of these bacteria had no C31:9. Strain IK-1Delta8 had defects in the pfaD gene, one of the five pfa genes responsible for the biosynthesis of EPA. Although Escherichia coli DH5alpha does not produce EPA or DHA inherently, cells transformed with the pfa genes responsible for the biosynthesis of EPA and DHA produced EPA and DHA, respectively, but not C31:9. These results suggest that the Pfa protein complex is involved in the biosynthesis of C31:9 and that pfa genes must not be the only genes responsible for the formation of C31:9. In this report, we determined for the first time the molecular structure of the C31:9 and discuss the possible biosynthetic pathways of this compound.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of the eicosapentaenoic acid biosynthesis gene cluster from Shewanella sp. BR-2.
AB  - Forty-four eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-producing microbial strains were isolated  from the intestines of marine fishes. Among them, one strain showing a maximum level of EPA (4.78%of total fatty acids) was identified as Shewanella sp. BR-2 on the basis of its 16S rRNA sequence. The EPA content reached a maximum level during the mid-exponential phase of cell growth, and gradually decreased with further growth of the cells. A cosmid DNA including the EPA biosynthesis gene cluster consisting of pfaA-E was isolated from a cosmid library of genomic DNA of Shewanella sp. BR-2, named pCosEPA-BR2. An E. coli clone harboring pCosEPA-BR2 produced EPA at a maximum level of 7.5%of total fatty acids, confirming the EPA biosynthesis activity of the cloned gene cluster.
TI  - Lysine-91 of the tetraheme c-type cytochrome CymA is essential for quinone interaction and arsenate respiration in Shewanella sp. strain ANA-3.
AB  - The tetraheme c-type cytochrome, CymA, is essential for arsenate respiratory reduction in Shewanella sp. ANA-3, a model arsenate reducer. CymA is predicted to mediate electron transfer from quinols to the arsenate respiratory reductase (ArrAB). Here, we present biochemical and physiological evidence that CymA interacts with menaquinol (MQH(2)) substrates. Fluorescence quench titration with the MQH(2) analog, 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide (HOQNO), was used to demonstrate quinol binding of E. coli cytoplasmic membranes enriched with various forms of CymA. Wild-type CymA bound HOQNO with a K (d) of 0.1-1 microM. It was also shown that the redox active MQH(2) analog, 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (DMNH(2)), could reduce CymA in cytoplasmic membrane preparations. Based on a CymA homology model made from the NrfH tetraheme cytochrome structure, it was predicted that Lys91 would be involved in CymA-quinol interactions. CymA with a K91Q substitution showed little interaction with HOQNO. In addition, DMNH(2)-dependent reduction of CymA-K91Q was diminished by 45% compared to wild-type CymA. A DeltacymA ANA-3 strain containing a plasmid copy of cymA-K91Q failed to grow with arsenate as an electron acceptor. These results suggest that Lys91 is physiologically important for arsenate respiration and support the hypothesis that CymA interacts with menaquinol resulting in the reduction of the cytochrome.
TI  - Engineering of monomeric FK506-binding protein 22 with peptidyl prolyl cis-trans  isomerase. Importance of a V-shaped dimeric structure for binding to protein substrate.
AB  - FK506-binding protein 22 (FKBP22) from the psychrotrophic bacterium Shewanella sp. SIB1 is a homodimeric protein with peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) (EC 5.2.1.8) activity. Each monomer consists of 205 amino acid residues. According to a tertiary model, SIB1 FKBP22 assumes a V-shaped structure, in which two monomers interact with each other at their N-termini. Each monomer consists of an N-terminal domain with a dimerization core and a C-terminal catalytic domain, which are separated by a 40-residue-long a-helix. To clarify the role of this V-shaped structure, we constructed a mutant protein, in which the N-domain is tandemly repeated through a flexible linker. This protein, termed NNC-FKBP22, is designed such that two repetitive N-domains are folded into a structure similar to that of the Shewanella sp. SIB1 FKBP22 wild-type protein (WT). NNC-FKBP22 was overproduced in Escherichia coli in a His-tagged form, purified and biochemically characterized. Gel-filtration chromatography and ultracentrifugation analyses indicate that NNC-FKBP22 exists as a monomer. Analysis of thermal denaturation using differential scanning calorimetry indicates that NNC-FKBP22 unfolds with two transitions, as does the WT protein. NNC-FKBP22 exhibited PPIase activity for both peptide and protein substrates. However, in contrast to its activity for peptide substrate, which was comparable to that of the WT protein, its activity for protein substrate was reduced by five- to six-fold, compared to that of the WT. Surface plasmon resonance analyses indicate that NNC-FKBP22 binds to a reduced form of a-lactalbumin with a six-fold weaker affinity than that of WT. These results suggest that a V-shaped structure of SIB1 FKBP22 is important for efficient binding to a protein substrate.
TI  - Characterization of a cryptic plasmid pSFKW33 from Shewanella sp. 33B.
AB  - A cryptic plasmid pSFKW33 from psychrotrophic bacterium Shewanella sp. 33B, an isolate from the Gulf of Gdansk (the Baltic Sea), was sequenced and characterized. It is an 8021bp circular molecule with 38% GC content, which shows a distinctive nucleotide sequence without homology to other known plasmids. The nucleotide sequence analysis predicts eight open reading frames. The deduced amino acid sequence of ORF-1 shared significant similarity with the phage integrase protein from Pseudomonas putida GB-1. The ORF2 product showed some similarity with the hypothetical protein Shal_1786 from Shewanella halifaxensis HAW-EB4. The ORF-3 product revealed high amino acid sequence homology with the Escherichia coli replication initiation protein similar to pi protein of R6K plasmid. Five repeat regions (three perfect 22-bp repeats and two imperfect motifs), a putative ribosome binding site, and -10 and -35 promotor sequences were identified upstream of the ORF-3 (rep). The rep module is very similar to several theta replicating iteron family plasmids, suggesting that pSFKW33 replication follows the same course. The ORF-5 product revealed significant identity with the entry exclusion protein 1 of plasmid pIS2 from enteropathogenic strain E. coli 0111:H. The ORF-6 product showed significant identity with the putative transcriptional regulator protein from Shewanella benthica KT99 belonging to HTH-XRE-family protein. The ORF-8 encoded protein that showed some similarity with the hypothetical protein KT99_00146 from Shewanella benthica KT99. The ORF-4 and ORF-7 encoded putative proteins of 189 and 118 amino acid residues, respectively, with no homologies to any known proteins. The absolute copy number of pSFKW33 was estimated to be five copies per chromosome by real-time PCR.
TI  - Identification and characterization of N-acylhomoserine lactone-acylase from the  fish intestinal Shewanella sp. strain MIB015.
AB  - N-Acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) are used as quorum-sensing signal molecules by many gram-negative bacteria. We have reported that Shewanella sp. strain MIB015 degrades AHLs. In the present study, we cloned the aac gene from MIB015 by PCR with specific primers based on the aac gene in Shewanella oneidensis strain MR-1, which showed high homology with the known AHL-acylases. Escherichia coli expressing Aac showed high degrading activity of AHLs with long acyl chains. HPLC analysis revealed that Aac worked as AHL-acylase, which hydrolyzed the amide bond of AHL. In addition, expression of Aac in fish pathogen Vibrio anguillarum markedly reduced AHL production and biofilm formation. In conclusion, this study indicates that Aac might be effective in quenching quorum sensing of fish pathogens.
TI  - Expression of chromate resistance genes from Shewanella sp. strain ANA-3 in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The plasmidic chromate resistance genes chrBAC from Shewanella sp. strain ANA-3 were transferred to Escherichia coli. Expression of chrA alone, on a high- or low-copy number plasmid, conferred increased chromate resistance. In contrast, expression of the complete operon chrBAC on a high-copy number plasmid did not result in a significant increase in resistance, although expression on a low-copy number plasmid made the cells up to 10-fold more resistant to chromate. The chrA gene also conferred increased chromate resistance when expressed in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The chrR gene from the P. aeruginosa chromosome was necessary for full chromate resistance conferred by chrA. A diminished chromate uptake in cells expressing the chrA gene suggests that chromate resistance is due to chromate efflux.
TI  - Characterization of the arsenate respiratory reductase from Shewanella sp. strain ANA-3.
AB  - Microbial arsenate respiration contributes to the mobilization of arsenic from the solid to the soluble phase in various locales worldwide. To begin to predict the extent to which As(V) respiration impacts arsenic geochemical cycling, we characterized the expression and activity of the Shewanella sp. strain ANA-3 arsenate respiratory reductase (ARR), the key enzyme involved in this metabolism. ARR is expressed at the beginning of the exponential phase and persists throughout the stationary phase, at which point it is released from the cell. In intact cells, the enzyme localizes to the periplasm. To purify ARR, a heterologous expression system was developed in Escherichia coli. ARR requires anaerobic conditions and molybdenum for activity. ARR is a heterodimer of approximately 131 kDa, composed of one ArrA subunit (approximately 95 kDa) and one ArrB subunit (approximately 27 kDa). For ARR to be functional, the two subunits must be expressed together. Elemental analysis of pure protein indicates that one Mo atom, four S atoms associated with a bis-molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide cofactor, and four to five [4Fe-4S] are present per ARR. ARR has an apparent melting temperature of 41 degrees C, a Km of 5 microM, and a Vmax of 11,111 micromol of As(V) reduced min(-1) mg of protein(-1) and shows no activity in the presence of alternative electron acceptors such as antimonite, nitrate, selenate, and sulfate. The development of a heterologous overexpression system for ARR will facilitate future structural and/or functional studies of this protein family.
TI  - Identification of the gene encoding a type 1 RNase H with an N-terminal double-stranded RNA binding domain from a psychrotrophic bacterium.
AB  - The gene encoding a bacterial type 1 RNase H, termed RBD-RNase HI, was cloned from the psychrotrophic bacterium Shewanella sp. SIB1, overproduced in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein was purified and biochemically characterized. SIB1 RBD-RNase HI consists of 262 amino acid residues and shows amino acid sequence identities of 26% to SIB1 RNase HI, 17% to E. coli RNase HI, and 32% to human RNase H1. SIB1 RBD-RNase HI has a double-stranded RNA binding domain (RBD) at the N-terminus, which is commonly present at the N-termini of eukaryotic type 1 RNases H. Gel mobility shift assay indicated that this domain binds to an RNA/DNA hybrid in an isolated form, suggesting that this domain is involved in substrate binding. SIB1 RBD-RNase HI exhibited the enzymatic activity both in vitro and in vivo. Its optimum pH and metal ion requirement were similar to those of SIB1 RNase HI, E. coli RNase HI, and human RNase H1. The specific activity of SIB1 RBD-RNase HI was comparable to that of E. coli RNase HI and was much higher than those of SIB1 RNase HI and human RNase H1. SIB1 RBD-RNase HI showed poor cleavage-site specificity for oligomeric substrates. SIB1 RBD-RNase HI was less stable than E. coli RNase HI but was as stable as human RNase H1. Database searches indicate that several bacteria and archaea contain an RBD-RNase HI. This is the first report on the biochemical characterization of RBD-RNase HI.
TI  - Construction of a low-temperature protein expression system using a cold-adapted  bacterium, Shewanella sp. strain Ac10, as the host.
AB  - A recombinant protein expression system working at low temperatures is expected to be useful for the production of thermolabile proteins. We constructed a low-temperature expression system using an Antarctic cold-adapted bacterium, Shewanella sp. strain Ac10, as the host. We evaluated the promoters for proteins abundantly produced at 4 degrees C in this bacterium to express foreign proteins. We used 27 promoters and a broad-host-range vector, pJRD215, to produce beta-lactamase in Shewanella sp. strain Ac10. The maximum yield was obtained when the promoter for putative alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AhpC) was used and the recombinant cells were grown to late stationary phase. The yield was 91 mg/liter of culture at 4 degrees C and 139 mg/liter of culture at 18 degrees C. We used this system to produce putative peptidases, PepF, LAP, and PepQ, and a putative glucosidase, BglA, from a psychrophilic bacterium, Desulfotalea psychrophila DSM12343. We obtained 48, 7.1, 28, and 5.4 mg/liter of culture of these proteins, respectively, in a soluble fraction. The amounts of PepF and PepQ produced by this system were greater than those produced by the Escherichia coli T7 promoter system.
TI  - Identification of RNase HII from psychrotrophic bacterium, Shewanella sp. SIB1 as a high-activity type RNase H.
AB  - The gene encoding RNase HII from the psychrotrophic bacterium, Shewanella sp. SIB1 was cloned, overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein was purified and biochemically characterized. SIB1 RNase HII is a monomeric protein with 212 amino acid residues and shows an amino acid sequence identity of 64% to E. coli RNase HII. The enzymatic properties of SIB1 RNase HII, such as metal ion preference, pH optimum, and cleavage mode of substrate, were similar to those of E. coli RNase HII. SIB1 RNase HII was less stable than E. coli RNase HII, but the difference was marginal. The half-lives of SIB1 and E. coli RNases HII at 30 degrees C were approximately 30 and 45 min, respectively. The midpoint of the urea denaturation curve and optimum temperature of SIB1 RNase HII were lower than those of E. coli RNase HII by approximately 0.2 M and approximately 5 degrees C, respectively. However, SIB1 RNase HII was much more active than E. coli RNase HII at all temperatures studied. The specific activity of SIB1 RNase HII at 30 degrees C was 20 times that of E. coli RNase HII. Because SIB1 RNase HII was also much more active than SIB1 RNase HI, RNases HI and HII represent low- and high-activity type RNases H, respectively, in SIB1. In contrast, RNases HI and HII represent high- and low-activity type RNases H, respectively, in E. coli. We propose that bacterial cells usually contain low- and high-activity type RNases H, but these types are not correlated with RNase H families.
TI  - Gene cloning, overproduction, and characterization of thermolabile alkaline phosphatase from a psychrotrophic bacterium.
AB  - The gene encoding alkaline phosphatase from the psychrotrophic bacterium Shewanella sp. SIB1 was cloned, sequenced, and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein was purified and its enzymatic properties were compared with those of E. coli alkaline phosphatase (APase), which shows an amino acid sequence identity of 37%. The optimum temperature of SIB1 APase was 50 degrees C, lower than that of E. coli APase by 30 degrees C. The specific activity of SIB1 APase at 50 degrees C was 3.1 fold higher than that of E. coli APase at 80 degrees C. SIB1 APase lost activity with a half-life of 3.9 min at 70 degrees C, whereas E. coli APase lost activity with a half-life of >6 h even at 80 degrees C. Thus SIB1 APase is well adapted to low temperatures. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of SIB1 and E. coli APases suggests that decreases in electrostatic interactions and number of disulfide bonds are responsible for the cold-adaptation of SIB1 APase.
TI  - Stabilities and activities of the N- and C-domains of FKBP22 from a psychrotrophic bacterium overproduced in Escherichia coli.
AB  - FKBP22 from a psychrotrophic bacterium Shewanella sp. SIB1, is a dimeric protein  with peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity. According to homology modeling, it consists of an N-terminal domain, which is involved in dimerization of the protein, and a C-terminal catalytic domain. A long alpha3 helix spans these domains. An N-domain with the entire alpha3 helix (N-domain+) and a C-domain with the entire alpha3 helix (C-domain+) were overproduced in Escherichia coli in a His-tagged form, purified, and their biochemical properties were compared with those of the intact protein. C-domain+ was shown to be a monomer and enzymatically active. Its optimum temperature for activity (10 degrees C) was identical to that of the intact protein. Determination of the PPIase activity using peptide and protein substrates suggests that dimerization is required to make the protein fully active for the protein substrate or that the N-domain is involved in substrate-binding. The differential scanning calorimetry studies revealed two distinct heat absorption peaks at 32.5 degrees C and 46.6 degrees C for the intact protein, and single heat absorption peaks at 44.7 degrees C for N-domain+ and 35.6 degrees C for C-domain+. These results indicate that the thermal unfolding transitions of the intact protein at lower and higher temperatures represent those of C- and N-domains, respectively. Because the unfolding temperature of C-domain+ is much higher than its optimum temperature for activity, SIB1 FKBP22 may adapt to low temperatures by increasing a local flexibility around the active site. This study revealed the relationship between the stability and the activity of a psychrotrophic FKBP22.
TI  - Cold-active DnaK of an Antarctic psychrotroph Shewanella sp. Ac10 supporting the  growth of dnaK-null mutant of Escherichia coli at cold temperatures.
AB  - Shewanella sp. Ac10 is a psychrotrophic bacterium isolated from the Antarctica that actively grows at such low temperatures as 0 degrees C. Immunoblot analyses showed that a heat-shock protein DnaK is inducibly formed by the bacterium at 24 degrees C, which is much lower than the temperatures causing heat shock in mesophiles such as Escherichia coli. We found that the Shewanella DnaK (SheDnaK) shows much higher ATPase activity at low temperatures than the DnaK of E. coli (EcoDnaK): a characteristic of a cold-active enzyme. The recombinant SheDnaK gene supported neither the growth of a dnaK-null mutant of E. coli at 43 degrees C nor lambda phage propagation at an even lower temperature, 30 degrees C. However, the recombinant SheDnaK gene enabled the E. coli mutant to grow at 15 degrees C. This is the first report of a DnaK supporting the growth of a dnaK-null mutant at low temperatures.
TI  - Characterization of the eicosapentaenoic acid biosynthesis gene cluster from Shewanella sp. strain SCRC-2738.
AB  - The 38 kb eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) biosynthesis gene cluster of Shewanella sp. strain SCRC-2738 was cloned into the cosmid vector (pEPA). A 27 kb nucleotide sequence of the XhoI to SpeI region of pEPA showed EPA production (6.3%) in E. coli JM109. Among the nine open reading frames (ORFs) in this sequence, only five (ORFs 2 and 5-8) were essential for EPA production. High levels of production (16%-22%) were found in E. coli JM109 transformed with a multicopy pNEB vector carrying only the five essential ORFs and in that transformed with a pNEB vector that integrated ORFs 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8, and vector pSTV28 that integrated the ORF2 encoding phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase). Thus, production of EPA appears to be regulated by the presence of all the biosynthesis gene products and by the ratio of PPTase to the other gene products. The temperature -EPA production relationship in E. coli strain DH5alpha varied between constructs, suggesting that it is controlled not only by EPA biosynthesis enzymes but also by other factors in vivo. There was a strict upper temperature limit for EPA biosynthesis: no EPA was synthesized at 30 degrees C in E. coli transformants carrying any gene construct for EPA biosynthesis.
TI  - Possible involvement of an FKBP family member protein from a psychrotrophic bacterium Shewanella sp. SIB1 in cold-adaptation.
AB  - A psychrotrophic bacterium Shewanella sp. strain SIB1 was grown at 4 and 20 degrees C, and total soluble proteins extracted from the cells were analyzed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Comparison of these patterns showed that the cellular content of a protein with a molecular mass of 28 kDa and an isoelectric point of four greatly increased at 4 degrees C compared to that at 20 degrees C. Determination of the N-terminal amino acid sequence, followed by the cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding this protein, revealed that this protein is a member of the FKBP family of proteins with an amino acid sequence identity of 56% to Escherichia coli FKBP22. This protein was overproduced in E. coli in a His-tagged form, purified, and analyzed for peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity. When this activity was determined by the protease coupling assay using N-succinyl-Ala-Leu-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide as a substrate at various temperatures, the protein exhibited the highest activity at 10 degrees C with a k(cat)/K(m) value of 0.87 micro m(-1) x s(-1). When the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity was determined by the RNase T(1) refolding assay at 10 and 20 degrees C, the protein exhibited higher activity at 10 degrees C with a k(cat)/K(m) value of 0.50 micro m(-1) x s(-1). These k(cat)/K(m) values are lower but comparable to those of E. coli FKBP22. We propose that a FKBP family protein is involved in cold-adaptation of psychrotrophic bacteria.
TI  - Genetic identification of a respiratory arsenate reductase.
AB  - For more than a decade, it has been recognized that arsenate [H2AsO41-; As(V)] can be used by microorganisms as a terminal electron acceptor in anaerobic respiration. Given the toxicity of arsenic, the mechanistic basis of this process is intriguing, as is its evolutionary origin. Here we show that a two-gene cluster (arrAB; arsenate respiratory reduction) in the bacterium Shewanella sp. strain ANA-3 specifically confers respiratory As(V) reductase activity. Mutants with in-frame deletions of either arrA or arrB are incapable of growing on As(V), yet both are able to grow on a wide variety of other electron acceptors as efficiently as the wild-type. Complementation by the wild-type sequence rescues the mutants' ability to respire As(V). arrA is predicted to encode a 95.2-kDa protein with sequence motifs similar to the molybdenum containing enzymes of the dimethyl sulfoxide reductase family. arrB is predicted to encode a 25.7-kDa iron-sulfur protein. arrA and arrB comprise an operon that contains a twin arginine translocation (Tat) motif in ArrA (but not in ArrB) as well as a putative anaerobic transcription factor binding site upstream of arrA, suggesting that the respiratory As(V) reductase is exported to the periplasm via the Tat pathway and under anaerobic transcriptional control. These genes appear to define a new class of reductases that are specific for respiratory As(V) reduction.
TI  - Curvularia haloperoxidase: antimicrobial activity and potential application as a  surface disinfectant.
AB  - A presumed antimicrobial enzyme system, the Curvularia haloperoxidase system, was examined with the aim of evaluating its potential as a sanitizing agent. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, Curvularia haloperoxidase facilitates the oxidation of halides, such as chloride, bromide, and iodide, to antimicrobial compounds. The Curvularia haloperoxidase system caused several-log-unit reductions in counts of bacteria (Pseudomonas spp., Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Aeromonas salmonicida, Shewanella putrefaciens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Listeria monocytogenes), yeasts (Candida sp. and Rhodotorula sp.), and filamentous fungi (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus tubigensis, Aspergillus versicolor, Fusarium oxysporum, Penicillium chrysogenum, and Penicillium paxilli) cultured in suspension. Also, bacteria adhering to the surfaces of contact lenses were killed. The numbers of S. marcescens and S. epidermidis cells adhering to contact lenses were reduced from 4.0 and 4.9 log CFU to 1.2 and 2.7 log CFU, respectively, after treatment with the Curvularia haloperoxidase system. The killing effect of the Curvularia haloperoxidase system was rapid, and 10(6) CFU of E. coli cells/ml were eliminated within 10 min of treatment. Furthermore, the antimicrobial effect was short lived, causing no antibacterial effect against E. coli 10 min after the system was mixed. Bovine serum albumin (1%) and alginate (1%) inhibited the antimicrobial activity of the Curvularia haloperoxidase system, whereas glucose and Tween 20 did not affect its activity. In conclusion, the Curvularia haloperoxidase system is an effective sanitizing system and has the potential for a vast range of applications, for instance, for disinfection of contact lenses or medical devices.
TI  - Evaluation of preservative systems in a sunscreen formula by linear regression method.
AB  - A sunscreen formula with eight different preservative systems was evaluated by linear regression, pharmacopeial, and the CTFA (Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association) methods. The preparations were tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Burkholderia cepacia, Shewanella putrefaciens, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus sp. The linear regression method proved to be useful in the selection of the most effective preservative system used in cosmetic formulation.
TI  - Cloning of cold-active alkaline phosphatase gene of a psychrophile, Shewanella sp., and expression of the recombinant enzyme.
AB  - A psychrophilic alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) from Shewanella sp. is a cold-active enzyme that has high catalytic activity at low temperature [Ishida et al. (1998) Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem., 62, 2246-2250]. Here, we identified the nucleotide sequence of a gene encoding the enzyme after cloning with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and inverted PCR techniques. The deduced amino acid sequence of the enzyme contained conserved amino acids found among mesophilic alkaline phosphatases and showed some structural characteristics including a high content of hydrophobic amino acid residues and the lack of single alpha-helix compared with the alkaline phosphatase of Escherichia coli, which were possibly efficient for catalytic reaction at low temperatures. The recombinant enzyme expressed in E. coli was purified to homogeneity with the molecular mass of 41 kDa. The recombinant enzyme had a specific activity of 1,500 units/mg and had high catalytic activity at low temperatures.
TI  - Heat labile ribonuclease HI from a psychrotrophic bacterium: gene cloning, characterization and site-directed mutagenesis.
AB  - The rnhA gene encoding RNase HI from a psychrotrophic bacterium, Shewanella sp. SIB1, was cloned, sequenced and overexpressed in an rnh mutant strain of Escherichia coli. SIB1 RNase HI is composed of 157 amino acid residues and shows 63% amino acid sequence identity to E.coli RNase HI. Upon induction, the recombinant protein accumulated in the cells in an insoluble form. This protein was solubilized and purified in the presence of 7 M urea and refolded by removing urea. Determination of the enzymatic activity using M13 DNA-RNA hybrid as a substrate revealed that the enzymatic properties of SIB1 RNase HI, such as divalent cation requirement, pH optimum and cleavage mode of a substrate, are similar to those of E.coli RNase HI. However, SIB1 RNase HI was much less stable than E.coli RNase HI and the temperature (T(1/2)) at which the enzyme loses half of its activity upon incubation for 10 min was approximately 25 degrees C for SIB1 RNase HI and approximately 60 degrees C for E.coli RNase HI. The optimum temperature for the SIB1 RNase HI activity was also shifted downward by 20 degrees C compared with that of E.coli RNase HI. Nevertheless, SIB1 RNase HI was less active than E.coli RNase HI even at low temperatures. The specific activity determined at 10 degrees C was 0.29 units/mg for SIB1 RNase HI and 1.3 units/mg for E.coli RNase HI. Site-directed mutagenesis studies suggest that the amino acid substitution in the middle of the alphaI-helix (Pro52 for SIB1 RNase HI and Ala52 for E.coli RNase HI) partly accounts for the difference in the stability and activity between SIB1 and E.coli RNases HI.
TI  - Identification of a plasmid-encoded gene from Haemophilus ducreyi which confers NAD independence.
AB  - Members of the family Pasteurellaceae are classified in part by whether or not they require an NAD supplement for growth on laboratory media. In this study, we demonstrate that this phenotype can be determined by a single gene, nadV, whose presence allows NAD-independent growth of Haemophilus influenzae and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. This gene was cloned from a 5.2-kb plasmid which was previously shown to be responsible for NAD independence in Haemophilus ducreyi. When transformed into A. pleuropneumoniae, this cloned gene allowed NAD-independent growth on complex media and allowed the utilization of nicotinamide in place of NAD on defined media. Sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 1,482 bp that is predicted to encode a protein with a molecular mass of 55,619 Da. Compared with the sequence databases, NadV was found to have significant sequence homology to the human pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor PBEF and to predicted proteins of unknown function identified in the bacterial species Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Shewanella putrefaciens, Synechocystis sp., Deinococcus radiodurans, Pasteurella multocida, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. P. multocida and A. actinomycetemcomitans are among the NAD-independent members of the Pasteurellaceae. Homologues of NadV were not found in the sequenced genome of H. influenzae, an NAD-dependent member of the Pasteurellaceae, or in species known to utilize a different pathway for synthesis of NAD, such as Escherichia coli. Sequence alignment of these nine homologues revealed regions and residues of complete conservation that may be directly involved in the enzymatic activity. Identification of a function for this gene in the Pasteurellaceae should help to elucidate the role of its homologues in other species.
TI  - Production of eicosapentaenoic acid by a recombinant marine cyanobacterium, Synechococcus sp.
AB  - The eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) synthesis gene cluster from an EPA-producing bacterium, Shewanella sp. SCRC-2738, was cloned into a broad-host range vector, pJRD215, and then introduced into a marine cyanobacterium, Synechococcus sp. NKBG15041c, by conjugation. The transconjugant cyanobacteria produced 3.7 +/- 0.2% (2.24 +/- 0.13 mg/L) EPA (n-3) and 2.5 +/- 0.2% (1.49 +/- 0.06 mg/L) eicosatetraenoic acid (n-3) of the total fatty acids when the cells were cultured at 23 degrees C at a light intensity of 1,000-1,500 Lux. The EPA and eico-satetraenoic acid contents of the cells were increased to 4.6 +/- 0.6% (3.86 +/- 1.11 mg/L) and 4.7 +/- 0.3% (3.86 +/- 0.82 mg/L), and 7.5 +/- 0.3% (1.76 +/- 0.10 mg/L) and 5.1 +/- 0.2% (1.19 +/- 0.06 mg/L) when they were cultured at low temperature (18 degrees C) and at lower light intensity (40 Lux), respectively.
TI  - Cloning of phosphatase I gene from a psychrophile, Shewanella sp., and some properties of the recombinant enzyme.
AB  - Psychrophilic phosphatase I from Shewanella sp. is a cold enzyme that was found as a novel protein-tyrosine-phosphatase (PTPase, EC 3. 1.3.48) with a histidine as its catalytic residue [Tsuruta and Aizono (1999) J. Biochem. 125, 690-695]. Here, we determined the nucleotide sequence of a DNA fragment (2,004 bp) containing the phosphatase I gene by cloning with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and inverted PCR techniques. The deduced amino acid sequence, of the enzyme contained a conserved region of protein-serine/threonine-phosphatase (PPase). The 38.5 kDa-recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli was purified to homogeneity by glutathione-Sepharose 4B column chromatography, treatment with endoproteinase and Mono-Q column chromatography. The recombinant enzyme had a specific activity of 49.4 units and, like native psychrophilic phosphatase I, exhibited high catalytic activity at low temperature and PTPase activity.
TI  - Cold-adapted alanine dehydrogenases from two antarctic bacterial strains: gene cloning, protein characterization, and comparison with mesophilic and thermophilic counterparts.
AB  - The genes encoding NAD(+)-dependent alanine dehydrogenases (AlaDHs) (EC 1.4.1.1)  from the Antarctic bacterial organisms Shewanella sp. strain Ac10 (SheAlaDH) and Carnobacterium sp. strain St2 (CarAlaDH) were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Of all of the AlaDHs that have been sequenced, SheAlaDH exhibited the highest level of sequence similarity to the AlaDH from the gram-negative bacterium Vibrio proteolyticus (VprAlaDH). CarAlaDH was most similar to AlaDHs from mesophilic and thermophilic Bacillus strains. SheAlaDH and CarAlaDH had features typical of cold-adapted enzymes; both the optimal temperature for catalytic activity and the temperature limit for retaining thermostability were lower than the values obtained for the mesophilic counterparts. The k(cat)/K(m) value for the SheAlaDH reaction was about three times higher than the k(cat)/K(m) value for VprAlaDH, but it was much lower than the k(cat)/K(m) value for the AlaDH from Bacillus subtilis. Homology-based structural models of various AlaDHs, including the two psychotropic AlaDHs, were constructed. The thermal instability of SheAlaDH and CarAlaDH may result from relatively low numbers of salt bridges in these proteins.
TI  - Expression of the eicosapentaenoic acid synthesis gene cluster from Shewanella sp. in a transgenic marine cyanobacterium, Synechococcus sp.
AB  - The eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) synthesis gene cluster isolated from a marine bacterium, Shewanella putrefaciens strain SCRC-2738, was cloned and expressed in the marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. A broad-host-range cosmid vector, pJRD215 (10.2 kb, Smr Kmr), was used to clone a 38 kb insert, pEPA, containing the EPA synthesis gene cluster, creating plasmid pJRDEPA (approx. 48 kb). This plasmid was transferred to the cyanobacterial host at a frequency of 2.2 x 10(-7). Cyanobacterial transconjugants grown at 29 degrees C produced 0.12 mg EPA (g dry weight)-1, whereas those grown at 23 degrees C produced 0.56 mg EPA (g dry weight)-1. The yield was further improved to 0.64 mg (g dry weight)-1 by incubation for 1 d at 17 degrees C. This is believed to be the first successful cloning and expression of such a large heterologous gene cluster in a marine cyanobacterium.
TI  - Comparison of the gene expression of aspartate beta-D-semialdehyde dehydrogenase  at elevated hydrostatic pressure in deep-sea bacteria.
AB  - Aspartate beta-D-semialdehyde dehydrogenase genes (asd) were cloned and sequenced from a deep-sea-adapted strictly barophilic bacterium, Shewanella sp. strain DB6705, and a moderately barophilic bacterium, Shewanella sp. strain DSS12. The determined asd sequences of these two strains were very similar, and the identity of the deduced amino acids sequences was 96.2%. The 5'-ends of the asd mRNA from both strains were localized at corresponding sites by primer extension analysis, and two transcriptional starting points, which differed by only 1 base, were detected. In strain DB6705, a pressure-regulated transcript was mainly observed, whereas in strain DSS12, a pressure-tolerant transcript was observed together with the pressure-regulated transcript. Western-blotting analysis showed that the ASD protein was expressed under higher pressure conditions in DB6705, and under all pressure conditions tested in DSS12, as reflected in the primer extension results. Our findings suggest that asd expression controlled by pressure is one of the important mechanisms involved in the adaptation of microorganisms to the deep-sea environment.
