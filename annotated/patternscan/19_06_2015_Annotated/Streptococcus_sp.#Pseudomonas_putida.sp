TI  == bacterial cell surface properties: role of loosely bound extracellular polymeric  substances (lb-eps).
AB  == this study investigated the effect of loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances (lb-eps) on the comprehensive surface properties of four bacteria (bacillus subtilis, streptococcus suis, escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida). the removal of lb-eps from bacterial surfaces by high-speed centrifugation (12,000xg) was confirmed by sem images. viability tests showed that the percentages of viable cells ranged from 95.9% to 98.0%, and no significant difference was found after treatment (p>0.05). ftir spectra revealed the presence of phosphodiester, carboxylic, phosphate, and amino functional groups on bacteria surfaces, and the removal of lb-eps did not alter the types of cell surface functional groups. potentiometric titration results suggested the total site concentrations on the intact bacteria were higher than those on lb-eps free bacteria. most of the acidity constants (pka) were almost identical, except the increased pka values of phosphodiester groups on lb-eps free s. suis and e. coli  surfaces. the electrophoretic mobilities and hydrodynamic diameters of the intact and lb-eps free bacteria were statistically unchanged (p>0.05), indicating lb-eps had no influence on the net surface charges and size distribution of bacteria. however, lb-esp could enhance cell aggregation processes. the four lb-eps free bacteria all exhibited fewer hydrophobicity values (26.1-65.0%) as compared to the intact cells (47.4-69.3%), suggesting the removal of uncharged nonpolar compounds (e.g., carbohydrates) in lb-eps. these findings improve our understanding of the changes in cell surface characterizations induced by lb-eps, and have important implications for assessing the role of lb-eps in bacterial adhesion and transport behaviors.

TI  == in vitro fermentation of lactulose by human gut bacteria.
AB  == lactulose has been known as a prebiotic that can selectively stimulate the growth of beneficial bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. recent studies have indicated that streptococcus mutans, clostridium perfringens, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii are also able to utilize lactulose. however, the previous studies mainly focused  on the utilization of lactulose by individual strains, and few studies were designed to identify the species that could utilize lactulose among gut microbiota. this study aimed to identify lactulose-metabolizing bacteria in the human gut, using in silico and traditional culture methods. the prediction results suggested that genes for the transporters and glycosidases of lactulose are well distributed in the genomes of 222 of 453 strains of gastrointestinal-tract bacteria. the screening assays identified 35 species with  the ability to utilize lactulose, of which cronobacter sakazakii, enterococcus faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas putida were reported for the first time to be capable of utilizing lactulose. in addition, significant correlations between lactulose and galactooligosaccharide metabolism were found.  thus, more attention should be paid to bacteria besides bifidobacteria and lactobacilli to further investigate the relationship between functional oligosaccharides and gut bacteria.

TI  == development and evaluation of a real-time fluorogenic loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay integrated on a microfluidic disc chip (on-chip lamp) for rapid and simultaneous detection of ten pathogenic bacteria in aquatic animals.
AB  == rapid, low-cost, and user-friendly strategies are urgently needed for early disease diagnosis and timely treatment, particularly for on-site screening of pathogens in aquaculture. in this study, we successfully developed a real-time fluorogenic loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay integrated on a microfluidic disc chip (on-chip lamp), which was capable of simultaneously detecting 10 pathogenic bacteria in aquatic animals, i.e., nocardia seriolae, pseudomonas putida, streptococcus iniae, vibrio alginolyticus, vibrio anguillarum, vibrio fluvialis, vibrio harveyi, vibrio parahaemolyticus, vibrio rotiferianus, and vibrio vulnificus. the assay provided a nearly-automated approach, with only a single pipetting step per chip for sample dispensing. this  technique could achieve limits of detection (lod) ranging from 0.40 to 6.42pg per 1.414mul reaction in less than 30 min. the robust reproducibility was demonstrated by a little variation among duplications for each bacterium with the coefficient of variation (cv) for time to positive (tp) value less than 0.10. the clinical sensitivity and specificity of this on-chip lamp assay in detecting field samples were 96.2% and 93.8% by comparison with conventional microbiological methods. compared with other well-known techniques, on-chip lamp  assay provides low sample and reagent consumption, ease-of-use, accelerated analysis, multiple bacteria and on-site detection, and high reproducibility, indicating that such a technique would be applicable for on-site detection and routine monitoring of multiple pathogens in aquaculture.

TI  == hyaluronic acid production with corynebacterium glutamicum: effect of media composition on yield and molecular weight.
AB  == aims: corynebacterium glutamicum was tested as an alternative host for heterologous production of hyaluronic acid (ha). methods and results: a set of expression vectors containing hasa, encoding ha synthase from streptococcus equi  subsp. zooepidemicus, alone or in combination with genes encoding enzymes for ha  precursor production (hasb, hasc, glmu from pseudomonas putida kt2440) or bacterial haemoglobin (vgb from vitreoscilla sp.) was constructed. recombinant coryne. glutamicum strains were cultivated in two different minimal media, cgxii  and mek700. ha was isolated from the culture broth by ethanol precipitation or ultrafiltration. analyses of the isolated ha revealed that overall production was higher in cgxii medium (1241 mg l(-1)) than in mek700 medium (363 mg l(-1)), but  molecular weight of the product was higher in mek700 (>1.4 mda) than in cgxii (<270 kda). coexpression of hasb, hasc or glmu had no effect on ha yield and did  not improve molecular weight of the product. coexpression of vgb lowered ha yield about 1.5-fold and did not affect molecular weight of the product. microscopy of  negative-stained cultures revealed that coryne. glutamicum produces no distinct ha capsule. conclusions: regulation of cell growth and gene expression level of hasa are reasonable starting points for controlling the molecular weight of ha produced by coryne. glutamicum. significance and impact of the study: corynebacterium glutamicum has a great potential as an alternative production host for ha. the fact that coryne. glutamicum produces no distinct ha capsule facilitates ha isolation and improves overall yield.

TI  == improving the lethal effect of cpl-7, a pneumococcal phage lysozyme with broad bactericidal activity, by inverting the net charge of its cell wall-binding module.
AB  == phage endolysins are murein hydrolases that break the bacterial cell wall to provoke lysis and release of phage progeny. recently, these enzymes have also been recognized as powerful and specific antibacterial agents when added exogenously. in the pneumococcal system, most cell wall associated murein hydrolases reported so far depend on choline for activity, and cpl-7 lysozyme constitutes a remarkable exception. here, we report the improvement of the killing activity of the cpl-7 endolysin by inversion of the sign of the charge of the cell wall-binding module (from -14.93 to +3.0 at neutral ph). the engineered  variant, cpl-7s, has 15 amino acid substitutions and an improved lytic activity against streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiresistant strains), streptococcus pyogenes, and other pathogens. moreover, we have demonstrated that  a single 25-mug dose of cpl-7s significantly increased the survival rate of zebrafish embryos infected with s. pneumoniae or s. pyogenes, confirming the killing effect of cpl-7s in vivo. interestingly, cpl-7s, in combination with 0.01% carvacrol (an essential oil), was also found to efficiently kill gram-negative bacteria such as escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida, an effect not described previously. our findings provide a strategy to improve the lytic activity of phage endolysins based on facilitating their pass through the negatively charged bacterial envelope, and thereby their interaction with the cell wall target, by modulating the net charge of the cell wall-binding modules.

TI  == activities of jatropha curcas phorbol esters in various bioassays.
AB  == jatropha curcas seeds contain 30-35% oil, which can be converted to high quality  biodiesel. however, jatropha oil is toxic, ascribed to the presence of phorbol esters (pes). in this study, isolated phorbol ester rich fraction (peef) was used to evaluate the activity of pes using three aquatic species based bioassays (snail (physa fontinalis), brine shrimp (artemeia salina), daphnia (daphnia magna)) and microorganisms. in all the bioassays tested, increase in concentration of pes increased mortality with an ec(50) (48 h) of 0.33, 26.48 and 0.95 mg l(-1) pes for snail, artemia and daphnia, respectively. the sensitivity of various microorganisms for pes was also tested. among the bacterial species tested, streptococcus pyogenes and proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 215 mg l(-1) pes; and pseudomonas putida were also sensitive with mic of 251 mg l(-1) pes. similarly, fusarium species of fungi exhibited ec(50) of 58 mg l(-1) pes, while aspergillus niger and curvularia lunata had ec(50) of 70 mg l(-1). the snail bioassay was most sensitive with 100% snail mortality at 1 mug of pes ml(-1). in conclusion, snail  bioassay could be used to monitor pes in jatropha derived products such as oil, biodiesel, fatty acid distillate, kernel meal, cake, glycerol or for contamination in soil or other environmental matrices. in addition, pes with molluscicidal/antimicrobial activities could be utilized for agricultural and pharmaceutical applications.

TI  == phosphoproteomic analysis reveals the multiple roles of phosphorylation in pathogenic bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == recent phosphoproteomic characterizations of bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis, pseudomonas putida, and pseudomonas aeruginosa have suggested that protein phosphorylation on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues is a major regulatory post-translational modification in bacteria. in this study, we carried out a global and site-specific phosphoproteomic analysis on the gram-positive pathogenic bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae. one hundred and two  unique phosphopeptides and 163 phosphorylation sites with distributions of 47%/44%/9% for ser/thr/tyr phosphorylations from 84 s. pneumoniae proteins were identified through the combined use of tio(2) enrichment and lc-ms/ms determination. the identified phosphoproteins were found to be involved in various biological processes including carbon/protein/nucleotide metabolisms, cell cycle and division regulation. a striking characteristic of s. pneumoniae phosphoproteome is the large number of multiple species-specific phosphorylated sites, indicating that high level of protein phosphorylation may play important roles in regulating many metabolic pathways and bacterial virulence.

TI  == molecular analysis of spoilage-related bacteria in pasteurized milk during refrigeration by pcr and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == bacterial diversity in fluid milk products has been extensively studied in order  to improve milk quality. here, we illustrate the utility of viable counts and pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) for monitoring the microbial spoilage of pasteurized milk during shelf life. five pasteurized milk samples stored at 4 degrees c were examined at 10 and 5 days before expiration and on the expiration day. with bacterial dna extracted directly from the samples, pcr-dgge  analysis indicated that pseudomonas became dominant in four samples. meanwhile, the aerobic plate count of these four samples exceeded the regulatory limit of 20,000 cfu/ml at 5 days before expiration, and the rapid psychrotrophic count markedly surpassed the aerobic plate count on the expiration day. streptococcus and buttiauxella spp. were detected in several samples. sequence analysis of dgge fragments revealed high diversity among pseudomonas spp. in the milk samples. p.  putida and p. migulae grew to high numbers during refrigerated storage. further identification of pseudomonas at the species level was facilitated by pcr and multiplex pcr using species-specific primers; consequently, p. fluorescens and p. fragi were observed. these results highlight an important role of pseudomonas in  the shelf life of pasteurized milk.

TI  == vitellogenin is a novel player in defense reactions.
AB  == the significance of the presence of vitellogenin (vg), a female-specific protein, in male and juvenile fish is uncertain. here we show that the vg purified from the rosy barb puntius conchonius possesses both antibacterial and hemagglutinating activities in vitro, and the male fish challenged with escherichia coli synthesize vg. these suggest that in addition to being involved  in yolk protein formation, vg is also involved in defense reactions, a novel function assigned to vg.

TI  == mutually exclusive distribution of is1548 and gbsi1, an active group ii intron identified in human isolates of group b streptococci.
AB  == the present study shows that active, self-splicing group ii intron gbsi1 is located downstream of the c5a-peptidase gene, scpb, in some group b streptococcus (gbs) isolates that lack insertion sequence is1548. is1548 was previously reported to be often present at the scpb locus in gbs isolated in association with endocarditis. since none of 67 gbs isolates examined, 40 of which were of serotype iii, harbored both is1548 and gbsi1, these two elements are suggested to be markers for different genetic lineages in gbs serotype iii. the dna region downstream of scpb in gbs isolates harboring either gbsi1, is1548, or none of these mobile elements was found to encode the laminin binding protein, lmb, which shows sequence similarities to a family of streptococcal adhesins. is1548 is inserted 9 bp upstream of the putative promoter for lmb, while the insertion site for gbsi1 is located 88 bp further upstream. sequences highly similar to gbsi1 exist also in streptococcus pneumoniae. an inverted repeat sequence, with features typical of transcription terminators, was identified immediately upstream of the insertion site for the group ii intron both in the gbs and s. pneumoniae sequences. this motif is suggested to constitute a target for the gbs  intron as well as for rather closely related introns in bacillus halodurans, pseudomonas alcaligenes, and pseudomonas putida. when transcripts containing the  gbsi1 intron were incubated at high concentrations of ammonium and magnesium, a major product with the expected length and sequence for the ligated exons was generated. unlike, however, all members of group ii investigated so far, the excised intron was in linear, rather than in a branched (lariat), form.

TI  == survival rate of microbes after freeze-drying and long-term storage.
AB  == the survival rates of 10 species of microorganisms were investigated after freeze-drying and preserving in a vacuum at 5 degrees c. the survival rates varied with species. the survival rates immediately after freeze-drying were different among yeast, gram-positive bacteria, and gram-negative bacteria, and the change in the 10-year survival rate was species-specific. the survival rate of yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae, was about 10% immediately after drying, and the rate did not decrease significantly during the 10-year storage period. survival rates after the drying of gram-positive bacteria, i.e., brevibacterium flavum, b. lactofermentum, corynebacterium acetoacidophilum, c. gultamicum, and streptococcus mutans, were around 80%. the survival rate of brevibacterium and corynebacterium did not decrease greatly during the storage period, whereas the rate of s. mutans decreased to about 20% after 10 years. survival rates after the drying of gram-negative bacteria, i.e., escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, serratia marcescens, and alcaligenes faecalis, were around 50%. the survival rate decreased for the first 5 years and then stabilized to around 10% thereafter.

TI  == isothiocyanates in myrosinase treated herb extract of cleome chrysantha decne. and their antimicrobial activities.
AB  == gc/ms analysis of the volatiles produced by the action of endogenous myrosinase in cleome chrysantha decne. herb, showed three major components, 1-isocyano-4-methyl benzene, gamma-muurolene and (cis) nerolidole (21.72%, 12.15% and 10.39%, respectively). 1-isocyano-4-methyl benzene is not produced from myrosinase treated seeds of cleome chrysantha decne., while muurolene and nerolidole were found at higher concentrations 16.1% and 13.67%, respectively. some other isothiocyanates identified in the seeds and leaves, but in low percentages, were 2-methylbutyl isothiocyanate, 4-methylthiobutyl isothiocyanate  and isothiocyanatomethyl benzene. enzymatic hydrolysis of the ethanol extract of  cleome chrysantha decne., produced two non-volatile isothiocyanates, 4, 6-dimethyltetrahydro-1,3-oxazine-2-thione and n-(-4-methyl-sulphinyl-3-butenyl) isothiocyanate which was established by aniline and methanolic ammonia to give the stable form of phenyl thiourea. they were identified by their spectroscopic data. these two isothiocyanates and the volatiles of the herb showed good antimicrobial activity against e. coli, pseudomonas putida and rhizobium meloloti (gram-negative bacteria) and moderate activity against bacillus subtilis and streptococcus lactis (gram-positive bacteria).

TI  == inhibition of human peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation by streptococcus pyogenes cell extract is associated with arginine deiminase activity.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus) cell extracts (ce) have a remarkably powerful and dose-dependent inhibitory effect on antigen, superantigen, or mitogen-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) proliferation in vitro. purification of the inhibitory component present in s. pyogenes type m5 (manfredo strain) ce by anion-exchange chromatography followed by gel filtration chromatography showed that the inhibitor had an approximate native molecular mass of 100 kda. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified inhibitory fractions followed by silver staining gave a single band with an approximate molecular mass of 47 kda, indicating that the inhibitor is composed of two identical subunits. nh2-terminal sequencing of the protein revealed that it was identical to the previously characterized streptococcal acid glycoprotein (sagp); this protein possesses between 31.5 and 39.0% amino acid identity with arginine deiminase (ad) from mycoplasma hominis, mycoplasma arginini, pseudomonas putida, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. ad enzyme activity was present in unfractionated ce prepared from a range of streptococcal strains, and partially purified inhibitory fractions of manfredo ce also had high levels of activity. the inhibitory effect of manfredo ce was overcome by the addition of l-arginine to proliferation assays in which human pbmc were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin. we conclude that sagp, or its homolog, possesses ad activity and that the potent inhibition of proliferation of human t cells by streptococcal ce is due to activity of this enzyme.

TI  == contamination of diagnostic ophthalmic solutions in primary eye care settings.
AB  == pharmaceutical agents and irrigating solutions are widely used in both optometric and ophthalmologic practices. contamination of these containers or solutions could possibly pose some risk of infection to a patient. we set out to investigate the possible contamination of a representative sample of these containers in small office practices. representative bottles of two diagnostic pharmaceutical agents and an irrigating solution were obtained from primary care  optometric and ophthalmologic practices in the san francisco-oakland bay area. these bottles were tested to investigate the rate of contamination and to identify the types of microorganisms in the contaminated solutions. sixty total samples (proparacaine, tropicamide, and an irrigating solution) were randomly cultured, and 11.7% of the samples showed contamination. pseudomonas cepacia, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas putida, and streptococcus species were the predominant organisms isolated from the contaminated bottles. in addition, 17 of the original 60 containers were further cultured for investigation of the dried residue particles around the threads of the containers. of these 17 containers, 13 (76.5%) tested positive for staphylococcus and micrococcus species.

TI  == the two-step lysis system of pneumococcal bacteriophage ej-1 is functional in gram-negative bacteria: triggering of the major pneumococcal autolysin in escherichia coli.
AB  == the holin function ejh of the pneumococcal bacteriophage ej-1 has been characterized. it shows structural features similar to, and functionally complemented, the prototype member of the holin family. in escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida the ejh product caused cellular death, and changes in cell morphology could be accounted for by lesions in the cytoplasmic membrane. expression of ejh resulted in the inhibition of growth in a variety of phylogenetically distant bacterial genera, suggesting a broad spectrum of action. concomitant expression of the ejh and ejl (encodes a lysin) genes led to lysis of e. coli and p. putida cells. remarkably, the ejl lysin was able to attack murein  from bacteria lacking choline in their sacculi, which suggests that pneumococcal  lysins have a broader substrate specificity than previously assumed. furthermore, the ejh holin was able to trigger activity of the major pneumococcal autolysin cloned and expressed in e. coli, and this raised new questions about the regulation of this model autolysin. a new function for holins in systems where the phage lysin is supposed to be associated with the membrane is proposed.

AB  == in the subjects of 835 strains of 37 clinically isolated microbial strains, which were separated and identified among materials collected from patients with various infections and which were sent from medical therapeutic institutions throughout japan in 1990, for the purpose of examining the antimicrobial activity of cefpiramide (cpm), its minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), together with those of other cephem antibiotics, was determined, and the following conclusions  were obtained. 1. microbial strains in which no cpm-resistant strains emerged were streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and anaerobic gram-positive cocci. 2. in comparison with reports by many researchers at the former half of the 1980s, microbial stains suggesting an increase in resistance to cpm were staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and haemophilus influenzae, but also in other microbial strains the resistance to cpm was observed in high ratios. 3. among strains used in the test, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, cephamycin and oxime type cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacilli of enterobacteriaceae, and new quinolone-resistant microbes were observed in high ratios; therefore, it was considered that cpm could not exert sufficient  antimicrobial activities to these strains because of many resistant strains being complicated among these "cpm-resistant strains". 4. it was discussed that "the resistance mechanism observed throughout beta-lactam drugs as a while and the study themes in the dimension including social circumstances where resistant strains emerged", as pointed out by the authors in 1989, increased the significance of these days in the evaluation of timecourse changes in microbes resistant to specific drugs including cpm. 5. there are many unfavorable conditions in the antimicrobial activities of cpm to clinically isolated strains  in recent years. however, it was jointly confirmed that cpm maintained effective  antimicrobial activities to the majority of clinically isolated strains. furthermore, when it was additionally considered that cpm was one of not many cephem drugs having persistent blood levels, a conclusion was drawn that cpm was  one of clincally useful cephem drugs even at present.

AB  == the bacteriology of the isolates from the throat swab and the sputum respectively of 2,539 patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in tohoku district of japan during the period from january to april in 1989 was documented. of the 2,539 patients, 1,694 had an acute upper respiratory infection, 609 had acute bronchitis, 46 had acute pneumonia, 84 had acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory infections and 106 had respiratory infections without diagnosis registered. 1887 (74.3%) strains of potential pathogens were recovered from 1507 (59.4%) of the 2539 cases. the rate of recovery of potential  pathogens was very high in patients of the younger age. these patients had elevated body-temperature. there were statistically significant differences in recovery rate when classified by diagnosis, prefecture and the period of investigation. of the 1,887 strains, 996 (52.8%) were gram-positive and 891 (47.2%) were gram-negative bacteria. the rate of recovery of gram-negative bacteria was high in patients who were less than 10 years old and more than 51 years old, in patients with pneumonia and chronic respiratory infections, and in  patients with fever. of the 1,887 strains, those which exceeded 100 were staphylococcus aureus (481 strains), haemophilus influenzae (340 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (329 strains), streptococcus pyogenes (117 strains) and  acinetobacter spp. (100 strains). species other than those mentioned above had less than 100 strains. in this group there were 39 strains of branhamella catarrhalis, 32 strains of escherichia coli, 97 strains of klebsiella spp., 40 strains of enterobacter spp., 25 strains of serratia spp., 12 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 43 strains of pseudomonas putida. there was a remarkable difference in recovery rate of each species when classified by diagnosis, age class, prefecture and the period of investigation, respectively. the above results indicated that gram-positive bacteria are more frequent than gram-negative bacteria, that enterobacteriaceae and glucose-non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria are only rarely found in primary care clinics, and that the bacteriology in primary care clinic is different from that of medical school-affiliated hospitals.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

AB  == the survival of selected hygienically relevant bacterial species in activated carbon (ac) filters on a bench scale was investigated. the results revealed that  after inoculation of the test strains the previously sterilized ac absorbed all bacteria (10(6) to 10(7)). after a period of 6 to 13 days without countable bacteria in the effluent, the numbers of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and pseudomonas putida increased up to 10(4) to 10(5) cfu/ml of effluent and 10(6) to 10(7) cfu/g of ac. when klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis were used, no growth in filters could be observed. the numbers of e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and p. putida, however, decreased immediately  and showed no regrowth in nonsterile ac from a filter which had been continuously connected to running tap water for 2 months. under these conditions an autochthonous microflora developed on the carbon surface which could be demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy and culturing methods (heterotrophic plate count). these bacteria reduced e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and p. putida densities in the effluent by a factor of more than 10(5) within 1 to 5 days. the  hypothesis that antagonistic substances of the autochthonous microflora were responsible for the elimination of the artificial contamination could not be confirmed because less than 1% of the isolates of the autochthonous microflora were able to produce such substances as indicated by in vitro tests. competition  for limiting nutrients was thought to be the reason for the observed effects.

TI  == beta-casomorphin immunoreactive materials in cows' milk incubated with various bacterial species.
AB  == to obtain information about the possible release of beta-casomorphins from beta-casein under in vitro conditions, cows' milk was incubated with 13 strains of gram-negative or gram-positive bacterial species isolated from bovine milk. after incubation periods of 1-24 d, milk samples were assayed for beta-casomorphin-4, -5, -6 or -7 immunoreactive materials. in general, no beta-casomorphin immunoreactive material was found in samples incubated with non-caseolytic strains, e.g. pseudomonas putida or streptococcus faecalis subsp.  faecalis; however, high levels were found in several samples incubated with caseolytic strains, e.g. ps. aeruginosa or bacillus cereus. when such materials were present, the amounts of beta-casomorphin-4, -6 or -7 greatly exceeded beta-casomorphin-5 immunoreactivity. it was concluded that while some of these materials probably represented authentic beta-casomorphins, others were more likely to be beta-casomorphin precursors.

TI  == immunological and structural relatedness of catabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferases and the anabolic enzymes of enterobacteria.
AB  == purified catabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferase of pseudomonas putida and anabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferase (argf product) of escherichia coli k-12 were used to prepare antisera. the two specific antisera gave heterologous cross-reactions of various intensities with bacterial catabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferases formed by pseudomonas and representative organisms of other bacterial genera. the immunological cross-reactivity observed only between the catabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferases and the anabolic enzymes of enterobacteria suggests that these proteins share some structural similarities. indeed, the amino acid composition of the anabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferase of e. coli k-12 (argf and argi products) closely resembles the amino acid compositions of the catabolic enzymes of pseudomonas putida, aeromonas formicans, streptococcus faecalis, and bacillus licheniformis. comparison of the n-terminal  amino acid sequence of the e. coli anabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferase with that of the a. formicans and pseudomonas putida catabolic enzymes shows, respectively, 45 and 28% identity between the compared positions; the a. formicans sequence reveals 53% identity with the pseudomonas putida sequence. these results favor the conclusion that anabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferases  of enterobacteria and catabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferases derive from a common ancestral gene.

TI  == impact of cefotaxime on the fecal flora in children.
AB  == a differential quantitative analysis was used to study the effect of cefotaxime on the fecal flora in 26 hospitalized children ranging from two days to four years of age. fecal specimens were obtained before, during and after therapy. this study was evaluated in comparison to 41 patients of the same age and from the same environment without antibiotic treatment or signs of infection. the fecal flora of the control group showed qualitative and quantitative stability. two groups of species were distinguished: a group in which the upper limit was less than or equal to 10(7) bacteria/g of stool (klebsiella, enterobacter, other  enterobacteria, staphylococcus, pseudomonas) and a group with less than or equal  to 10(10) bacteria/g of stool (anaerobes, escherichia coli, streptococcus d). this stability of the control group of subjects allowed us to interpret the variations of microbial concentrations during and after cefotaxime treatment. in  previous studies, we showed in the newborn a substantial risk of septicemia of intestinal origin when overgrowth occurred, especially with klebsiella. with cefotaxime there was a decrease or a disappearance in 65% of e. coli and a slight decrease of klebsiella and enterobacter. this fact was of great interest in the treatment of endogenous secondary septicemia. we observed an appearance of pseudomonas (nine pseudomonas aeruginosa, two pseudomonas putida, one pseudomonas fluorescens) in 12 cases among the 26 children treated.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
