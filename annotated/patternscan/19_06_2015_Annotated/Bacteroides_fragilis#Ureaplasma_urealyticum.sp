TI  == sensitive detection of thirteen bacterial vaginosis-associated agents using multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is characterized by a polymicrobial proliferation of anaerobic bacteria and depletion of lactobacilli, which are components of natural vaginal microbiota. currently, there are limited conventional methods for bv diagnosis, and these methods are time-consuming, expensive, and rarely allow for  the detection of more than one agent simultaneously. therefore, we conceived and  validated a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (m-pcr) assay for the simultaneous screening of thirteen bacterial vaginosis-associated agents (bv-aas) related to symptomatic bv: gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii, mobiluncus mulieris, bacteroides fragilis, mycoplasma hominis, atopobium vaginae, ureaplasma urealyticum, megasphaera type i, clostridia-like bacteria vaginosis-associated bacteria (bvabs) 1, 2, and 3, sneathia sanguinegens, and mycoplasma genitalium. the overall validation parameters of m-pcr compared to single pcr (spcr) were extremely high, including agreement of 99.1% and sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values of 100.0%, negative predictive value of 97.0%, accuracy of 99.3%, and agreement with nugent results of 100.0%. the prevalence of bv-aas was very high (72.6%), and simultaneous agents were detected in 53.0%, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the m-pcr assay. therefore, the m-pcr assay has great potential to impact bv diagnostic methods in vaginal samples and  diminish associated complications in the near future.

TI  == [possible role of enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis in the etiology of infectious vaginitis].
AB  == vaginitis is a common gynecologic disorder. it is due to several causes, some even unknown. bacteroides fragilis is the most important anaerobe in clinical bacteriology, some strains of this group are notable for being enterotoxigenic and they have been associated with intestinal and extraintestinal syndromes. they have recently been isolated from patients with vaginitis. the purpose of this study was to investigate a possible association of enterotoxigenic b. fragilis with infectious vaginitis. 265 samples of vaginal exudate were processed, 202 from symptomatic patients and 63 healthy women. the identification of the microorganisms was carried out by conventional methods. in 31.2% of symptomatic patients were identified: gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus, candida albicans, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum and streptococcus agalactiae. b. fragilis was identified in 27 symptomatic patients and 5 healthy women. these strains were cultivated in liquid medium and incubated during 48 h at 36 degrees  c in anaerobe chambers. supernatant activity was assayed in ht-29 cells. eighteen b. fragilis strains isolated from symptomatic patients were enterotoxigenic, because induced alterations in target cell morphology. it was not identified in healthy women (p < 0.05). 77.7% of enterotoxigenic b. fragilis strains were not associated with other specific pathogens. this fact suggests that enterotoxigenic b. fragilis could be a cause for vaginitis. the effect of enterotoxin on e-cadherin of vaginal epithelium could facilitate invasion and its possible pathogenic role in the vagina. this is the first report that associates enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis as a possible cause of infectious vaginitis.

TI  == amniotic fluid interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-6, but not interleukin-8 correlate with microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity in preterm labor.
AB  == problem: we compared the frequency of intra-amniotic infection in preterm labor (pl) with women not in labor, and correlated infection with amniotic fluid (af) cytokines. detailed identification of species, especially mycoplasmata, was tried to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of pl. method of study: af from  20 women with pl and 20 controls were evaluated. infection was detected by pcr for mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum and 16s rrna bacterial gene, which was cloned and sequenced for bacterial identification. interleukin (il)-1beta, il-6, il-8 and tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha levels were measured by elisa. results: frequency of intra-amniotic infection is higher in pl (40.0%). sequencing-based method identified bacteroides fragilis, prevotella bivia and leptotrichia amnionii, in addition to mycoplasma species detected by pcr. af infection correlated with increased il-1beta and il-6 levels. conclusion: the frequency of intra-amniotic infection, especially m. hominis, in pl women who delivered with 7 days, is high and correlates with high il-1beta and il-6 levels, but not il-8.

TI  == [the microorganisms associated with bacterial vaginosis as a cause of tubal sterility].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is one of the most widespread disturbances of the normal state of the vagina of women of reproductive and menopausal age. this condition is highly disregarded due to its moderate and not always clear clinical manifestation. the disturbed proportion of microorganisms in vagina is shown in the strong decrease or lack of lactobacilli and a spread of associated with bacterial vaginosis microorganisms. g. vaginalis, mobiluncis spp., bacteroides spp. (without b. fragilis), peptostreptococcus spp., mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum. the condition is a predisposition to a disturbance of natural defense mechanisms and to a spread of infectious agents towards the upper female genital tract. this is a predisposition for the development of tubal patency and motility disorders, ovarian function disturbances, endometrites. the  treatment of this condition as an important step in female sterility prophylaxis  is commented.

TI  == the characterization of nonbacterial prostatitis: search for an etiology.
AB  == nonbacterial prostatitis is often difficult to differentiate from other prostatic complaints and remains a vaguely characterized syndrome. prostatic fluid inflammatory cells and elevated immunoglobulins raise the suspicion that this syndrome is caused by some undetected infection. prostatic fluid antibodies against chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma urealyticum, staphylococcus, staphylococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens were measured in men with nonbacterial and bacterial prostatitis, and men without urinary symptoms by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. prostate specific antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase were measured in the prostatic fluid as indirect measures of secretory activity. of 44 men with nonbacterial prostatitis  9 (20%) had detectable prostatic fluid antichlamydial antibody titers, compared with 3 of 25 control men (12%) and 2 of 13 (15%) with bacterial prostatitis--no evidence for a higher prevalence of prostatic fluid antichlamydial antibody in men with nonbacterial prostatitis. prostatic antibodies to the other organisms were rarely detected. when compared with unaffected men the low levels of prostate specific antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase, and more alkaline prostatic fluid in men with bacterial and nonbacterial prostatitis suggest that secretory dysfunction accompanies the inflammation. these data show that none of  the organisms studied caused the majority of the cases of nonbacterial prostatitis and that either an agent as yet unidentified or multiple agents may be involved in the etiology of nonbacterial prostatitis.

TI  == infection and labor. vii. microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity in spontaneous rupture of membranes at term.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to determine the frequency, microbiologic characteristics, and clinical significance of microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity in women with premature rupture of membranes at term. study design: amniocentesis was performed in 32 women with term premature rupture of membranes and amniotic fluid cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and mycoplasmas. results: the prevalence of positive amniotic fluid cultures was 34.3% (11/32). the most common isolates were ureaplasma urealyticum, peptostreptococcus sp., lactobacillus sp., bacteroides fragilis, and fusobacterium sp. clinical chorioamnionitis occurred only in one patient with a positive amniotic fluid culture. her neonate had ophthalmitis. three patients (9.4%) had endometritis. among women who were delivered vaginally, those with a positive amniotic fluid culture had a significantly higher rate of endometritis than those with a negative culture (33% [3/9] vs 0% [0/20], respectively, p = 0.023). conclusions: these data indicate that microbial invasion of the amniotic  cavity occurs in approximately one third of patients with preterm premature rupture of membranes. microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity is a risk factor  for endometritis in women with term premature rupture of membranes.

TI  == newly documented antimicrobial activity of quinolones.
AB  == the improved antimicrobial activity of newer fluoroquinolones and novel applications recently found for the drugs already marketed are reviewed. several  new compounds are more active against gram-positive bacteria than the presently marketed fluoroquinolones. win 57273, the most potent compound in vitro on a weight basis, is 16 to 128 times more active than ciprofloxacin against various staphylococci, streptococci, enterococcus spp., corynebacterium spp., listeria monocytogenes and bacillus spp. bmy 40062, pd 117558, pd 127391, sparfloxacin, temafloxacin and tosufloxacin also show enhanced in vitro efficacy against these  species. these drugs also possess increased activity against various anaerobes, notably clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile and the bacteroides fragilis group. mycobacterium tuberculosis, rapidly growing mycobacteria other than mycobacterium chelonae, and mycobacterium leprae are often susceptible to quinolones displaying bactericidal activity which is potentially useful for curing difficult-to-treat mycobacteriosis. in addition, a number of new products, notably those containing a cyclopropyl group, are more active than reference fluoroquinolones against mycobacterium leprae. sparfloxacin, bmy 40062 and win 57273 compare favorably with older fluoroquinolones in the killing of intracellular legionella spp., and several of the newer compounds have greater antichlamydial potency. improved antibacterial activity has also been found against mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas maltophilia. by contrast, the newer quinolones have similar or less activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae. recently, pefloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were found to be active against protozoa, including plasmodium spp., trypanosoma cruzi and leishmania donovani, but not against toxoplasma gondii. in the near future, more specific research testing unusual pathogens may lead to the identification of quinolones with more selective activity.

TI  == prostaglandin production by amnion and decidual cells in response to bacterial products.
AB  == media from bacterial cultures have been tested for actions on prostaglandin biosynthesis by human amnion and decidual cells. the bacterial species, which are commonly associated with intrauterine infections, were group b streptococcus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, gardnerella vaginalis, neisseria gonorrhea, mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum. overall, low doses of bacterial products were stimulatory of amnion prostaglandin production, whereas high doses were inhibitory. a similar pattern of results was  obtained for effects on decidual prostaglandin production, although stimulatory actions at low doses were less pronounced. in all experiments interleukin 1 beta  consistently induced a stimulation of prostaglandin production that greatly exceeded that caused by any bacterial product. it is possible that the inhibitory action of high doses of bacterial products on prostaglandin biosynthesis may contribute to the poor course of labor experienced by women with chorioamnionitis. furthermore, these data lend credence to the view that the host response to infection (i.e. cytokine secretion) is the major mediator of subsequent preterm labor.

TI  == association of chlamydia trachomatis and mycoplasma hominis with intrauterine growth retardation and preterm delivery. the john hopkins study of cervicitis and adverse pregnancy outcome.
AB  == the authors conducted a prospective study of risk factors for intrauterine growth retardation (birth weight less than a standard (race- and sex-adjusted) 10th percentile for gestational age) and preterm birth (birth prior to 37 weeks gestation) in a high-risk, inner-city, obstetric population, with special interest in pathogens colonizing the maternal genital tract. a total of 801 women within 22 to 30 weeks of gestation were enrolled and interviewed. subjects were cultured for gardnerella vaginalis, group b streptococcus, trichomonas vaginalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, bacteroides fragilis, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, chlamydia trachomatis, and candida albicans, and they were followed  to delivery. intrauterine growth retardation and preterm delivery occurred in 8%  and 13% of these pregnancies, respectively. after adjustment for other important  risk factors, colonization with c. trachomatis was significantly associated both  with intrauterine growth retardation (odds ratio = 2.4, 90% confidence interval 1.32-4.18) and preterm delivery (odds ratio = 1.6, 90% confidence interval 1.01-2.50). colonization with c. albicans was significantly associated with intrauterine growth retardation (odds ratio = 1.9, 90% confidence interval 1.20-3.14); colonization with m. hominis was significantly associated with preterm birth (odds ratio = 2.0, 90% confidence interval 1.42-2.93). these associations support the probable role of infection in preterm and intrauterine growth retardation births and suggest the need for carefully designed intervention studies.
