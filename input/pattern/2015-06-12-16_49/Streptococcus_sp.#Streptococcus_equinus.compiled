TI  - Differences between endocarditis caused by Streptococcus bovis and Enterococcus spp. and their association with colorectal cancer.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis group and Enterococcus spp. share phenotypic characteristics  and intestinal habitat. Both have been associated with endocarditis and colorectal neoplasm (CRN). We studied all cases of endocarditis diagnosed between 1988 and 2014 in our centre and caused by S. bovis (109, 48.8 % of the bacteremia) and by Enterococcus spp. (36, 3.4 % of the bacteremia). Patients were seen until death or during a long-term follow-up, in order to rule out a concomitant CRN. The 109 cases of S. bovis endocarditis (SbIE) compared with the 36 caused by enterococci showed: a higher proportion of males (91 % vs. 72 %, p=0.005), more multivalvular involvement (28 % vs. 6 %, p=0.004), embolic complications (44 vs. 22 %, p=0.02) and colorectal neoplasm (64 % vs. 25 %, p=0.001). SbIE showed fewer co-morbidities (32 vs. 58 %, p=0.005), and less frequently urinary infection source (0 vs. 25 %, p=0.001) and healthcare-related infection (2 vs. 44 %, p=0.001). A total of 123 patients were followed up for an extended period (mean: 65.9 +/- 57.5 months). During the follow-up, 6 of 28 (21 %) cases with enterococcal endocarditis and 43 of 95 (45.2 %, p=0.01) cases with SbIE developed a new CRN. These neoplasiae appeared a mean of 60.4 months later (range 12-181 months). Among the 43 cases with SbIE and CRN, 12 had had a previously normal colonoscopy and 31 had had a previous CRN and developed a second neoplasm. Cases of SbIE present important differences with those caused by Enterococcus spp. Colonoscopy must be mandatory both in the initial evaluation of SbIE, as during the follow-up period.
TI  - Association of Streptococcus bovis presence in colonic content with advanced colonic lesion.
AB  - AIM: To prospectively examine the association between presence of Streptococcus bovis (S. bovis) in colonic suction fluid and the endoscopic findings on colonoscopy. METHODS: From May 2012 to March 2013, 203 consecutive patients who underwent colonoscopy for any reason were enrolled in the study. Exclusion criteria included: antibiotic use in the previous month, age younger than 18 years, and inadequate preparation for colonoscopy. The colonoscopy was performed for the total length of the colon or to the occluding tumor. The endoscopic findings were registered. Samples were obtained proximal to the colonoscopic part of the suction tube from each patient and sent to the clinical microbiology laboratory for isolation and identification of S. bovis. Samples were incubated in enrichment media with addition of antibiotic disks for inhibition of growth of Gram-negative rods. The samples were seeded on differential growth media; suspected positive colonies were isolated and identified with Gram staining, catalase, and pyrrolidonyl arylamidase tests, and further identified using a VITEK2 system. Statistical analyses were performed using the Student's t and chi(2) tests. RESULTS: Of the 203 patients recruited, 49 (24%) patients were found to be S. bovis carriers; of them, the endoscopic findings included: 17 (34.7%) cases with malignant tumors, 11 (22.4%) with large polyps, 5 (10.2%) with medium-sized polyps, 6 (12.2%) with small polyps, 4 (8.1%) with colitis, and 6 (12.2%) normal colonoscopies. Of 154 patients found negative for S. bovis, the endoscopic findings included: none with malignant tumors, 9 (5.8%) cases with large polyps, 11 (7.1%) with medium-sized polyps, 26 (16.9%) with small polyps, 7 (4.5%) with colitis, and 101 (65.6%) normal colonoscopies. S. bovis (Gram-positive coccus) is considered part of the normal intestinal flora. There is an association between S. bovis bacteremia and colonic neoplasia. It is not well understood whether the bacterium has a pathogenetic role in the development of neoplasia or constitutes an epiphenomenon of colorectal neoplasms. There was a clear relationship between positivity for S. bovis in colonic suction fluid and findings of malignant tumors and large polyps in the colon. CONCLUSION: There is an association between S. bovis bacteremia and malignant colonic lesions; this should prompt for development of a reliable screening method for advanced colonic lesions.
TI  - The clinical epidemiology and malignancies associated with Streptococcus bovis biotypes in 506 cases of bloodstream infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of Streptococcus bovis (Sb) biotypes causing bacteraemia and associated malignancies. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of patients with Sb bacteraemia, pulled out from a prospective surveillance protocol of bacteraemia cases, in three areas of Spain (1990-2013): a cattle area (Lugo), a fishing area (Ferrol) and an urban area (Barcelona). Colonoscopy and Sb biotypes (Sb-I and Sb-II) were determined in most cases. RESULTS: 506 patients with Sb bacteraemia; mean age 68.1 (+/-14.1) years, and 66.2% were males. The cattle area, compared with the fishing and urban areas, had higher incidence of bacteraemia by SbI (40.29 vs 9.38 vs 6.15 cases/106 person-years, P < 0.001) and bacteraemia by Sb-II (29.07 vs 9.84 vs 13.37 cases/106 person-years, P < 0.001). The Sb-I cases (n = 224), compared with Sb-II cases (n = 270), had greater rates of endocarditis (77.6% vs 9.6%, P < 0.001) and colorectal neoplasm (CRN) (50.9% vs 16.6%, P < 0.001), and smaller rates of biliary tract infection (2.2% vs 29.6%, P < 0.001) and non-colorectal malignancy (8.9% vs 31.4%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: There was a link between the cattle area and higher incidence of Sb bacteraemia. Sb-I differed from Sb-II cases in clinical findings and associated malignancies. Colonoscopy is mandatory in cases of endocarditis or bacteraemia caused by Sb-I.
TI  - Pulmonary endarterectomy for pulmonary hypertension from septic emboli.
AB  - Pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) can significantly increase long-term survival in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension; however, the role of PEA for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension due to pulmonary valve endocarditis is controversial. A critically ill 61-year-old man with intractable right ventricular heart failure was found to have chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension due to Streptococcus bovis pulmonary valve endocarditis and underwent successful pulmonary valve replacement and PEA. The successful outcome in this case suggests that PEA should be considered in patients with this condition.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of chicken beta-defensin (4 and 10) peptides against pathogenic bacteria and fungi.
AB  - Host Defense Peptides (HDPs) are small cationic peptides found in several organisms. They play a vital role in innate immunity response and immunomodulatory stimulation. This investigation was designed to study the antimicrobial activities of beta-defensin peptide-4 (sAvBD-4) and 10 (sAvBD-4) derived from chickens against pathogenic organisms including bacteria and fungi. Ten bacterial strains and three fungal species were used in investigation. The results showed that the sAvBD-10 displayed a higher bactericidal potency against all the tested bacterial strains than that of sAvBD-4. The exhibited bactericidal activity was significant against almost the different bacterial strains at different peptide concentrations except for that of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and Streptococcus bovis (Str. bovis) strains where a moderate effect was noted. Both peptides were effective in the inactivation of fungal species tested yielding a killing rate of up to 95%. The results revealed that the synthetic peptides were resistant to salt at a concentration of 50 mM NaCl. However, they lost antimicrobial potency when applied in the presence of high salt concentrations. Based on blood hemolysis studies, a little hemolytic effect was showed in the case of both peptides even when applied at high concentrations. The data obtained from this study indicated that synthetic avian peptides exhibit strong antibacterial and antifungal activity. In conclusion, future work and research should be tailored to a better understanding of the mechanisms of action of those peptides and their potential use in the pharmaceutical industry to help reduce the incidence and impact of infectious agent and be marketed as a naturally occurring antibiotic.
TI  - Antimicrobial Activity of Chemokine CXCL10 for Dermal and Oral Microorganisms.
AB  - CXCL10 (IP-10) is a small 10 kDa chemokine with antimicrobial activity. It is induced by IFN-gamma, chemoattracts mononuclear cells, and promotes adhesion of T cells. Recently, we detected CXCL10 on the surface of the skin and in the oral cavity. In the current study, we used broth microdilution and radial diffusion assays to show that CXCL10 inhibits the growth of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium jeikeium, Corynebacterium striatum, and Candida albicans HMV4C, but not Corynebacterium bovis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Poryphromonas gingivalis, or C. albicans ATCC 64124. The reason for the selective antimicrobial activity is not yet known. However, antimicrobial activity of CXCL10 may be related to its composition and structure, as a cationic 98 amino acid residue molecule with 10 lysine residues, 7 arginine residues, a total net charge of +11, and a theoretical pI of 9.93. Modeling studies revealed that CXCL10 contains an alpha-helix at the N-terminal, three anti-parallel beta-strands in the middle, and an alpha-helix at the C-terminal. Thus, CXCL10, when produced on the surface of the skin or in the oral cavity, likely has antimicrobial activity and may enhance innate antimicrobial and cellular responses to the presence of select commensal or opportunistic microorganisms.
TI  - [Infection due to Mycobacterium bovis in common variable immunodeficiency].
AB  - Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is an heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by impaired antibody production. It shows a wide spectrum of manifestations including severe and recurrent respiratory infections (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus) and gastrointestinal (Campylobacter jejuni, rotavirus and Giardia lamblia). Viral infections caused by herpes zoster, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and hepatitis C are rare. The opportunistic agents such as CMV, Pneumocystis jirovecii, cryptococcus and atypical mycobacteria have been reported as isolated cases. This paper reports the case of a 38-year-old female patient, who began six years before with weight loss of 7 kg in six months, fatigue, weakness, sweating, fever and abdominal pain. Furthermore, patient had intestinal obstruction and abdominal CT showed mesenteric lymph growth. The mesenteric lymph node biopsy revealed positives Mycobacterium PCR, Ziehl-Neelsen staining and culture for M. bovis. In the laparotomy postoperative period was complicated with nosocomial pneumonia, requiring mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy. Two years later, she developed right renal abscess that required surgical drainage, once again with a positive culture for Mycobacterium bovis. She was referred to highly specialized hospital and we documented panhypogammaglobulinemia and lymphopenia. Secondary causes of hypogammaglobulinemia were ruled out and common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) was confirmed, we started IVIG replacement. Four years later she developed mixed cellularity Hodgkin's lymphoma. Until today she continues with IVIG and chemotherapy. This report of a patient with CVID and Mycobacterium bovis infection, a unusual association, shows the cellular immunity susceptibility in this immunodeficiency, additional to the humoral defect.
TI  - Draft Genome Sequence of Streptococcus equinus (Streptococcus bovis) HC5, a Lantibiotic Producer from the Bovine Rumen.
AB  - Streptococcus equinus (Streptococcus bovis) HC5 is a bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacterium with simple growth requirements. The draft genome sequence of S. equinus HC5 consists of 1,846,241 bp, with a G+C content of 37.04%. In silico analysis indicated that S. equinus HC5 might be useful to control bacteria that are detrimental to livestock animals.
TI  - Neonatal invasive Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus infection with delayed central nervous system complications.
AB  - Group D streptococci are known to cause newborn septicemia and meningitis, but the Streptococcus bovis group strains rarely cause serious neonatal infections in Korea. Central nervous system (CNS) complications of neonatal S. bovis group infection have rarely been reported. In adults, S. bovis group strains cause bacteremia and endocarditis, and are associated with gastrointestinal malignancy. However, only a few studies have reported meningitis and septicemia in infants. Here, we describe a case of bacteremia and meningitis due to Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus with a delayed CNS complication in an infant. A 28-day-old male infant was admitted to the hospital with a 1-day history of fever. Cultures of blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine showed the presence of S. bovis group strain-S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus. He was discharged after 21 days of intravenous ampicillin and cefotaxime administration. Two weeks later, he was readmitted with a fever and short episodes of tonic-clonic movements. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed marked bilateral frontal subdural effusion. He was discharged after 31 days of antibiotic therapy, and no neurological sequelae were observed at the 9-month follow-up. In conclusion, we present a rare case of neonatal S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus infection causing urinary tract infection, septicemia, meningitis, and delayed CNS complications. This case emphasizes the need for physicians to be aware of S. bovis infection in infants.
TI  - Suicin 3908, a new lantibiotic produced by a strain of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 isolated from a healthy carrier pig.
AB  - While Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is known to cause severe infections in pigs,  it can also be isolated from the tonsils of healthy animals that do not develop infections. We hypothesized that S. suis strains in healthy carrier pigs may have the ability to produce bacteriocins, which may contribute to preventing infections by pathogenic S. suis strains. Two of ten S. suis serotype 2 strains isolated from healthy carrier pigs exhibited antibacterial activity against pathogenic S. suis isolates. The bacteriocin produced by S. suis 3908 was purified to homogeneity using a three-step procedure: ammonium sulfate precipitation, cationic exchange HPLC, and reversed-phase HPLC. The bacteriocin, called suicin 3908, had a low molecular mass; was resistant to heat, pH, and protease treatments; and possessed membrane permeabilization activity. Additive effects were obtained when suicin 3908 was used in combination with penicillin G or amoxicillin. The amino acid sequence of suicin 3908 suggested that it is lantibiotic-related and made it possible to identify a bacteriocin locus in the genome of S. suis D12. The putative gene cluster involved in suicin production by S. suis 3908 was amplified by PCR, and the sequence analysis revealed the presence of nine open reading frames (ORFs), including the structural gene and those required for the modification of amino acids, export, regulation, and immunity. Suicin 3908, which is encoded by the suiA gene, exhibited approximately 50% identity with bovicin HJ50 (Streptococcus bovis), thermophilin 1277 (Streptococcus thermophilus), and macedovicin (Streptococcus macedonicus). Given that S. suis 3908 cannot cause infections in animal models, that it is susceptible to conventional antibiotics, and that it produces a bacteriocin with antibacterial activity against all pathogenic S. suis strains tested, it could potentially be used to prevent infections and to reduce antibiotic use by the swine industry.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis endocarditis: analysis of cases between 2005 and 2014.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus bovis is a classical etiology of endocarditis and is associated with colonic lesions. No series of cases from Brazil has been described. OBJECTIVES: To describe aspects of S. bovis endocarditis. METHODS: This is a case series of patients admitted to a cardiac surgery referral center, during the years 2005-2014. Clinical, laboratory, echochardiographic, colonoscopic, treatment, surgical and outcome variables were studied. RESULTS: Nine patients with S. bovis endocarditis were included; all cases fulfilled the modified Duke criteria. Incidence was 8/220 (4%) in years 2006-2014. There were seven male and two female patients; mean age was 56.7 years, standard deviation 13.4. All patients had native aortic valve involvement. Presentation was subacute in 7/9 (71%). Fever was present in 7/9 (77.7%), embolic lesions to solid organs occurred in three, and perivalvular abscess in two patients. All echocardiograms showed moderate to severe valvular regurgitation and vegetations. Microcytic anemia was seen in 7/7 patients. Colonoscopy showed abnormal findings in 7/9 (77.7%). Surgery was indicated for 6/9 patients due to acute aortic regurgitation and left ventricular failure. All patients were discharged home. CONCLUSIONS: S. bovis most frequently affected the aortic valve of male patients. Colon disease was frequent. Surgery was indicated frequently due to hemodynamic compromise.
TI  - Comparison of species identification of endocarditis associated viridans streptococci using rnpB genotyping and 2 MALDI-TOF systems.
AB  - Streptococcus spp. are important causes of infective endocarditis but challenging in species identification. This study compared identification based on sequence determination of the rnpB gene with 2 systems of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, MALDI Biotyper (Bruker) and VITEK MS IVD (bioMerieux). Blood culture isolates of viridans streptococci from 63 patients with infective endocarditis were tested. The 3 methods showed full agreement for all 36 isolates identified in the Anginosus, Bovis, and Mutans groups or identified as Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus gordonii, or Streptococcus sanguinis. None of the methods could reliably identify the 23 isolates to the species level when designated as Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, or Streptococcus tigurinus. In 7 isolates classified to the Mitis group, the rnpB sequences deviated strikingly from all reference sequences, and additional analysis of sodA and groEL genes indicated the occurrence of yet unidentified Streptococcus spp.
TI  - Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus infection in twin infants.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, previously known as Streptococcus bovis biotype II.2, is an uncommon pathogen in neonates. Nevertheless, it can cause severe neonatal sepsis and meningitis often clinically indistinguishable from those caused by group B streptococci and has been associated with considerable morbidity. We report the first known cases of S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus infection in twin infants.
TI  - Acquisition through horizontal gene transfer of plasmid pSMA198 by Streptococcus  macedonicus ACA-DC 198 points towards the dairy origin of the species.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus macedonicus is an intriguing streptococcal species whose most frequent source of isolation is fermented foods similarly to Streptococcus thermophilus. However, S. macedonicus is closely related to commensal opportunistic pathogens of the Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyzed the pSMA198 plasmid isolated from the dairy strain Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198 in order to provide novel clues about the main ecological niche of this bacterium. pSMA198 belongs to the narrow host range pCI305/pWV02 family found primarily in lactococci and to the best of our knowledge it is the first such plasmid to be reported in streptococci. Comparative analysis of the pSMA198 sequence revealed a high degree of similarity with plasmids isolated from Lactococcus lactis strains deriving from milk or its products. Phylogenetic analysis of the pSMA198 Rep showed that the vast majority of closely related proteins derive from lactococcal dairy isolates. Additionally, cloning of the pSMA198 ori in L. lactis revealed a 100% stability of replication over 100 generations. Both pSMA198 and the chromosome of S. macedonicus exhibit a high percentage of potential pseudogenes, indicating that they have co-evolved under the same gene decay processes. We identified chromosomal regions in S. macedonicus that may have originated from pSMA198, also supporting a long co-existence of the two replicons. pSMA198 was also found in divergent biotypes of S. macedonicus and in strains isolated from dispersed geographic locations (e.g. Greece and Switzerland) showing that pSMA198's acquisition is not a recent event. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Here we propose that S. macedonicus acquired plasmid pSMA198 from L. lactis via an ancestral genetic exchange event that took place most probably in milk or dairy products. We provide important evidence that point towards the dairy origin of this species.
TI  - Five cases of recurrent meningitis associated with chronic strongyloidiasis.
AB  - Although meningitis secondary to chronic strongyloidiasis is a rare complication, it is associated with a high mortality rate. Recurrent meningitis can occur if the underlying parasitic infection is left untreated. We report five cases of recurrent meningitis related to chronic strongyloidiasis that were associated with human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection. Common causative organisms are Escherichia coli, Streptococcus bovis, and Klebsiella pneumonia. One patient died during the second episode of meningitis. Three patients showed significant gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms before developing headache and fever. In four cases, patients developed multiple recurrences even with the treatment of thiabendazol. Ivermectin seems to be a better agent compared with thiabendazol to achieve eradication of strongyloidiasis.

TI  - Failure of early diagnosis of infective endocarditis in Japan--a retrospective descriptive analysis.
AB  - Infective endocarditis (IE) is a severe disease with high morbidity and mortality, and these can be exacerbated by delay in diagnosis. We investigated IE diagnosis in Japan with the emphasis on the delay in diagnosis and its cause and implications. We conducted a retrospective study on 82 definite IE patients at Kobe University Hospital from April 1, 2008, through March 31, 2013. We reviewed charts of the patients for data such as causative pathogens, prescription of inappropriate antibiotic use prior to the diagnosis, existence of risk factors of IE, previous doctor's subspecialty, or duration until the diagnosis, with the primary outcome of 180-day mortality. We also qualitatively, as well as quantitatively, analyzed those cases with delay in diagnosis, and hypothesized its causes and implications. Eighty-two patients were reviewed for this analysis. The average age was 61 +/- 14.5-year-old. Fifty percent of patients had known underlying risk factors for IEs, such as prosthetic heart valve (10), valvular heart disease (21), congenital heart disease (3), or cardiomyopathy (2). The median days until the diagnosis was 14 days (range 2 days to 1 year). Sixty-five percent of patients received inappropriate antibiotic before the diagnosis (53). Forty percent of causative organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA 20, MRSA 13), 32% were viridans streptococci and Streptococcus bovis, 28% were others or unknown (CNS 5, Corynebacterium 3, Cardiobacterium 1, Candida 1). Subspecialties such as General Internal Medicine (15), and Orthopedics (13) were associated with delay in diagnosis. Ten patients (12%) died during follow up, and 8 of them had been received prior inappropriate antibiotics. Significant delay in the diagnosis of IE was observed in Japan. Inappropriate antibiotics were prescribed frequently and may be associated with poor prognosis. Further improvement for earlier diagnosis of IE is needed.
TI  - Reduction of teat skin mastitis pathogen loads: differences between strains, dips, and contact times.
AB  - The purpose of these experiments was to (1) assess differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to teat disinfectants (teat dips), and (2) determine the optimum time for premilking teat dips to remain in contact with teat skin to reduce pathogen loads on teat skin. Two experiments were conducted using the excised teat model. In experiment 1, the differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to 4 commercially available dips (dip A: 1% H2O2; dip B: 1% chlorine dioxide; dip C: 1% iodophor; and dip D: 0.5% iodophor) were evaluated. Four strains of 11 common mastitis pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Mycoplasma bovis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hyicus, Staphylococcus xylosus, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus) were tested. In experiment 2, the percentage log reduction of mastitis pathogens (Escherichia coli, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Klebsiella species, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus xylosus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) on teat skin with 3 commercially available teat dips: dip A; dip D; and dip E: 0.25% iodophor, using dip contact times of 15, 30, and 45 s, was evaluated. Experiment 1 results indicated significant differences in strain sensitivities to dips within pathogen species: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus chromogenes, and Streptococcus uberis. Species differences were also found where Mycoplasma bovis (97.9% log reduction) was the most sensitive to tested teat dips and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (71.4% log reduction) the most resistant. Experiment 2 results indicated that contact times of 30 and 45 s were equally effective in reducing recovered bacteria for dips D and E and were also significantly more effective than a 15-s contact time. No differences were seen in recovered bacteria between tested contact times after treatment with dip A. It can be concluded that different mastitis pathogen species and strains within species may possess different sensitivities to teat dips, which may have implications in selection of teat dips on dairies. Furthermore, a 30-s premilking dip contact time for iodophors and 15 s for H2O2 dips may be optimal in reducing pathogen load in the shortest amount of time. A reduction in premilking teat dip contact time may improve milking parlor efficiency.
TI  - Immunomodulatory properties of Streptococcus and Veillonella isolates from the human small intestine microbiota.
AB  - The human small intestine is a key site for interactions between the intestinal microbiota and the mucosal immune system. Here we investigated the immunomodulatory properties of representative species of commonly dominant small-intestinal microbial communities, including six streptococcal strains (four Streptococcus salivarius, one S. equinus, one S. parasanguinis) one Veillonella parvula strain, one Enterococcus gallinarum strain, and Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 as a bench mark strain on human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. The different streptococci induced varying levels of the cytokines IL-8, TNF-alpha, and IL-12p70, while the V. parvula strain showed a strong capacity to induce IL-6. E. gallinarum strain was a potent inducer of cytokines and TLR2/6 signalling. As Streptococcus and Veillonella can potentially interact metabolically and frequently co-occur in ecosystems, immunomodulation by pair-wise combinations of strains were also tested for their combined immunomodulatory properties. Strain combinations induced cytokine responses in dendritic cells that differed from what might be expected on the basis of the results obtained with the individual strains. A combination of (some) streptococci with Veillonella appeared to negate IL-12p70 production, while augmenting IL-8, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-alpha responses. This suggests that immunomodulation data obtained in vitro with individual strains are unlikely to adequately represent immune responses to mixtures of gut microbiota communities in vivo. Nevertheless, analysing the immune responses of strains representing the dominant species in the intestine may help to identify immunomodulatory mechanisms that influence immune homeostasis.

TI  - Production of itaconic acid in Escherichia coli expressing recombinant alpha-amylase using starch as substrate.
AB  - Several studies on fermentative production of a vinyl monomer itaconic acid from  hydrolyzed starch using Aspergillus terreus have been reported. Herein, we report itaconic acid production by Escherichia coli expressing recombinant alpha-amylase, using soluble starch as its sole carbon source. To express alpha-amylase in E. coli, we first constructed recombinant plasmids expressing alpha-amylases by using cell surface display technology derived from two amylolytic bacteria, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens NBRC 15535(T) and Streptococcus bovis NRIC 1535. The recombinant alpha-amylase from S. bovis (SBA) showed activity at 28 degrees C, which is the optimal temperature for production of itaconic acid, while alpha-amylase from B. amyloliquefaciens displayed no noticeable activity. E. coli cells expressing SBA produced 0.15 g/L itaconic acid after 69 h cultivation under pH-stat conditions, using 1% starch as the sole carbon source. In fact, E. coli cells expressing SBA had similar growth rates when grown in the presence of 1% glucose or starch, thereby highlighting the expression of an active alpha-amylase that enabled utilization of starch to produce itaconic acid in E. coli.
TI  - [Recurrent meningitis due to anatomical defects: The bacteria indicates its origin].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recurrent meningitis is a rare disease. Anatomical abnormalities and immunodeficiency states are predisposing factors. Four cases, in which immunodeficiency was excluded, are presented. The causal microorganism led to the detection of the anatomical defect responsible for the recurrences. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of 4 cases with clinical diagnosis of recurrent bacterial meningitis. RESULTS: Case 1: a thirty month-old boy with unilateral hearing loss, diagnosed with Mondini abnormality by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after 2 episodes of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis. Surgical repair after third recurrence. Case 2: fourteen year-old girl diagnosed by MRI with cribriform plate defect after 3 episodes of meningitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed. Case 3: girl with meningitis due to Staphylococcus aureus at 2 and 7 months. MRI shows occipital dermal sinus requiring excision. Complication with cerebellar abscesses because of a coexisting dermoid cyst. Case 4: child with meningitis due to Streptococcus bovis at 9 days and Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli at 7 months, with positive cultures to Citrobacter freundii and E. faecium later on. Spinal MRI led to the diagnosis of Currarino syndrome with CSF fistula, which was surgically repaired. The 4 patients had undergone image studies reported as normal during the first episodes. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with recurrent meningitis the possibility of an anatomical defect should be considered. The isolated microorganism should help to locate it. It is essential to know the normal flora of the different anatomical sites. The definitive treatment is usually surgical.
TI  - Effects of nitrate addition to a diet on fermentation and microbial populations in the rumen of goats, with special reference to Selenomonas ruminantium having the ability to reduce nitrate and nitrite.
AB  - This study investigated the effects of dietary nitrate addition on ruminal fermentation characteristics and microbial populations in goats. The involvement of Selenomonas ruminantium in nitrate and nitrite reduction in the rumen was also examined. As the result of nitrate feeding, the total concentration of ruminal volatile fatty acids decreased, whereas the acetate : propionate ratio and the concentrations of ammonia and lactate increased. Populations of methanogens, protozoa and fungi, as estimated by real-time PCR, were greatly decreased as a result of nitrate inclusion in the diet. There was modest or little impact of nitrate on the populations of prevailing species or genus of bacteria in the rumen, whereas Streptococcus bovis and S. ruminantium significantly increased. Both the activities of nitrate reductase (NaR) and nitrite reductase (NiR) per total mass of ruminal bacteria were increased by nitrate feeding. Quantification of the genes encoding NaR and NiR by real-time PCR with primers specific for S. ruminantium showed that these genes were increased by feeding nitrate, suggesting that the growth of nitrate- and nitrite-reducing S. ruminantium is stimulated by nitrate addition. Thus, S. ruminantium is likely to play a major role in nitrate and nitrite reduction in the rumen.
TI  - Cloning, expression, and purification of a new antibacterial substance gene from  larvae of Musca domestica (Diptera: Muscidae).
AB  - Musca domestica L. (Diptera: Muscidae), the housefly, exhibits unique immune defenses and can produce antibacterial substances upon stimulation with bacteria. On the basis of the cDNA library constructed using the suppression subtractive hybridization method, a 1188-bp antibacterial substance gene, which we named AS566, was amplified by rapid amplification of cDNA ends from M. domestica larva stimulated with Salmonella pullorum (Enterobacteriaceae: Salmonella). In this study, the full-length AS566 gene was cloned and inserted into a His-tagged Escherichia coli (Enterobacteriaceae: Escherichia) prokaryotic expression system to enable production of the recombinant protein. The recombinant AS566 protein was purified in denatured form from inclusion bodies and renatured to obtain functionally active AS566 protein. The bacteriostatic activity of the recombinant purified AS566 protein was assessed using the Oxford plate assay system and the results indicated that AS566 had antibacterial activity against six bacteria, including an E. coli clinical isolate, S. pullorum, Streptococcus bovis (Streptococcaceae: Streptococcus), Streptococcus suis, and Staphylococcus aureus (Staphylococcaceae: Staphylococcus) in vitro. The antibacterial activity of AS566 toward Gram- bacteria was two times greater than that against Gram+ bacteria. The sequencing results and BLAST analysis showed that the antibacterial substance gene AS566 was not homologous to any other antibacterial substance genes in GenBank. The antibacterial mechanisms of the newly discovered AS566 protein warrant further study.
TI  - Efficient co-displaying and artificial ratio control of alpha-amylase and glucoamylase on the yeast cell surface by using combinations of different anchoring domains.
AB  - Recombinant yeast strains that display heterologous amylolytic enzymes on their cell surface via the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchoring system are considered as promising biocatalysts for direct ethanol production from starchy materials. For the effective hydrolysis of these materials, the ratio optimization of multienzyme activity displayed on the cell surface is important. In this study, we have presented a ratio control system of multienzymes displayed on the yeast cell surface by using different GPI-anchoring domains. The novel gene cassettes for the cell-surface display of Streptococcus bovis alpha-amylase and Rhizopus oryzae glucoamylase were constructed using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SED1 promoter and two different GPI-anchoring regions derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae SED1 or SAG1. These gene cassettes were integrated into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome in different combinations. Then, the cell-surface alpha-amylase and glucoamylase activities and ethanol productivity of these recombinant strains were evaluated. The combinations of the gene cassettes of these enzymes affected the ratio of cell-surface alpha-amylase and glucoamylase activities and ethanol productivity of the recombinant strains. The highest ethanol productivity from raw starch was achieved by the strain harboring one alpha-amylase gene cassette carrying the SED1-anchoring region and two glucoamylase gene cassettes carrying the SED1-anchoring region (BY-AASS/GASS/GASS). This strain yielded 22.5 +/- 0.6 g/L of ethanol from 100 g/L of raw starch in 120 h of fermentation.
TI  - Is Streptococcus bovis a urinary pathogen?
AB  - The Streptococcus bovis group (SBG) comprises several microorganisms associated with human infections. They have been associated with bacteremia, endocarditis, biliary tract infection, meningitis, and colorectal cancer, but their role as urinary pathogens is not well known. The objective of this investigation was to discover the incidence and clinical significance of the bacteriuria associated with this complex. A retrospective analysis of all adult patients with bacteriuria caused by SBG during the period 1995-2012 was carried out. During the study period, SBG was isolated in 153 adult patients, who had a mean age of 67 years, most of them being women (80%). Most of our patients (65%) had some underlying disease, with urologic disease being the most common (37%), followed by diabetes mellitus (27%) and neurologic disease (25%). Among the 88 patients in whom we were able to correctly assess symptoms, 45% had asymptomatic bacteriuria, 35% had lower urinary tract infection, and 20% had upper urinary tract infection. In 14 cases (9%), SBG was also isolated in blood cultures. Most of the isolates of SBG (72%) were S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin, 98% to nitrofurantoin, and 77% to fosfomycin. Although SBG bacteriuria is uncommon, it should not always be taken as a contaminant, mainly when S. pasteurianus is isolated, because it may cause urinary tract infections and, occasionally, sepsis, whereas when S. gallolyticus is isolated from urine, it may be a marker of underlying endocarditis and colorectal cancer.
TI  - Effect of fiber digestibility and conservation method on feed intake and the ruminal ecosystem of growing steers.
AB  - Fiber digestibility is an important factor regulating DMI in ruminants. Additionally, the ensiling process can also affect digestibility and chemical composition of the forage. The objective of this study was to investigate effects of sugarcane NDF digestibility (NDFD) and conservation method on intake, rumen kinetics, and the ruminal ecosystem of steers. Eight ruminally cannulated Nellore steers (275+/-22 kg BW) were used in a replicated 4x4 Latin square design with a 2x2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Two sugarcane genotypes divergent for stalk NDFD were used: IAC86-2480 with high NDFD and SP91-1049 with low NDFD. Experimental diets were formulated with 40% sugarcane, either freshly cut or as silage, and 60% concentrate on a DM basis. Each experimental period lasted for 14 d, with the last 4 d used for determination of intake, ruminal evacuation, and ruminal fluid collection. The effect of fiber digestibility on DM and NDF intake was dependent on the forage conservation method (P=0.01). High NDFD increased (P<0.01) DMI only when sugarcane was offered as silage, having no effect (P=0.41) on DMI when offered as freshly cut. Conservation method had no effect on total ruminal mass, with only a tendency (P<0.10) for greater NDF and indigestible NDF ruminal mass in steers fed the low-NDFD genotype. The NDF turnover and passage rates were greater (P<0.05) for the genotype with high NDFD but only when offered as silage. Liquid turnover rate in the rumen was greater (P=0.02) for diets containing silage, with no effect of genotype (P=0.87). There was no effect of NDFD genotype on ruminal pH (P=0.77); however, diets containing sugarcane as silage increased (P<0.01) ruminal pH. Total concentration of short chain fatty acids (P=0.05) and proportions of propionate (P=0.01) were greater for diets containing fresh sugarcane. Diets with fresh sugarcane increased the ruminal population of Streptococcus bovis (P<0.01) and Ruminococcus albus (P=0.03). The relative population of R. albus was also greater (P=0.04) for diets containing the sugarcane genotype with high NDFD. Feeding diets containing the sugarcane genotype with high NDFD increased Fibrobacter succinogenes population but only when sugarcane was fed as freshly cut (P=0.02). Using sugarcane genotypes with high NDFD can increase intake and benefit fiber-degrading bacteria in the rumen.
TI  - Draft Genome Sequences of Streptococcus bovis Strains ATCC 33317 and JB1.
AB  - We report the draft genome sequences of Streptococcus bovis strain ATCC 33317 (CVM42251) isolated from cow dung and strain JB1 (CVM42252) isolated from a cow rumen in 1977. The strains were sequenced using the Genome Sequencer FLX 454 system. The genome sizes are approximately 2 Mb and 2.2 Mb, respectively.
TI  - Active dry Saccharomyces cerevisiae can alleviate the effect of subacute ruminal  acidosis in lactating dairy cows.
AB  - The objective of the study was to determine the effect of active dry Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ADSC) supplementation on dry matter intake, milk yield, milk components, ruminal pH, and microbial community during a dietary regimen that leads to subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA). Sixteen multiparous, rumen-cannulated lactating Holstein cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 dietary treatments that included ADSC (Biomate; AB Vista, Marlborough, UK; 8 x 10(10) cfu/head per day) or control. During wk 1 to 6, all cows received a high-forage (HF) diet (77:23, forage:concentrate). Cows were then abruptly switched during wk 7 to a high-grain (HG) diet (49:51, forage:concentrate) and remained on the HG until the end of wk 10. Feed intake and milk yields were recorded daily. Ruminal pH was recorded continuously using an indwelling system for 1 to 2 d per week during the pre-experimental phase, and wk 6, 7, and 10. Ruminal digesta samples were collected at the end of the experiment and analyzed for relative change in microbial communities using real-time quantitative PCR. Cows were considered to have SARA if the duration below pH 5.6 was >/=300 min/d. Ruminal pH during wk 6 (HF plateau) was not different across treatments (15 +/- 46 min/d at pH <5.6). The dietary regimen successfully induced SARA during wk 7 (transition from HF to HG diet), and ruminal pH (551 +/- 46 min/d at pH <5.6) was not different across treatments. However, cows receiving ADSC had an improved ruminal pH (122 +/- 57 vs. 321 +/- 53 min/d at pH <5.6) during wk 10 (HG plateau) compared with control. Additionally, cows receiving ADSC had a better dry matter intake (23.3 +/- 0.66 vs. 21.6 +/- 0.61 kg/d) and 4% fat-corrected milk yield (29.6 +/- 1.2 vs. 26.5 +/- 1.2 kg/d) than control cows during the HG phase (wk 8 to 10). During HG feeding, cows receiving ADSC had greater total volatile fatty acid and propionate concentrations (175 +/- 7.5 vs. 154 +/- 7.5 and 117 +/- 6.1 vs. 94 +/- 5.7 mM for ADSC and control, respectively) and lower acetate:propionate ratio (0.26 +/- 0.5 vs. 0.36 +/- 0.05 for ADSC and control, respectively). Microbial analyses conducted on samples collected during wk 10 showed that cows supplemented with S. cerevisiae had a 9-fold, 2-fold, 6-fold, 1.3-fold, and 8-fold increase in S. cerevisiae, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Anaerovibrio lipolytica, Ruminococcus albus, and anaerobic fungi, respectively, which suggested an increase in cellulolytic microbes within the rumen. Cows supplemented with ADSC had 2.2-fold reduction in Prevotella albensis, which is a gram-negative bacterium predominant during SARA. Prevotella spp. are suggested to be an important source of lipopolysaccharide responsible for inflammation within the rumen. Cows supplemented with ADSC had a 2.3-fold increase in Streptococcus bovis and a 12-fold reduction in Megasphaera elsdenii. The reduction in M. elsdenii may reflect lower concentration of lactic acid within the rumen for ADSC cows. In conclusion, ADSC supplementation to dairy cows was demonstrated to alleviate the condition of SARA caused by abrupt dietary changes from HF to HG, and can potentially improve rumen function, as indicated by greater numbers of cellulolytic microorganisms within the rumen.
TI  - Genomics, evolution, and molecular epidemiology of the Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex (SBSEC).
AB  - The Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex (SBSEC) is a group of human and animal derived streptococci that are commensals (rumen and gastrointestinal tract), opportunistic pathogens or food fermentation associates. The classification of SBSEC has undergone massive changes and currently comprises 7 (sub)species grouped into four branches based on sequences identities: the Streptococcus gallolyticus, the Streptococcus equinus, the Streptococcus infantarius and the Streptococcus alactolyticus branch. In animals, SBSEC are causative agents for ruminal acidosis, potentially laminitis and infective endocarditis (IE). In humans, a strong association was established between bacteraemia, IE and colorectal cancer. Especially the SBSEC-species S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus is an emerging pathogen for IE and prosthetic joint infections. S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus and the S. infantarius branch are further associated with biliary and urinary tract infections. Knowledge on pathogenic mechanisms is so far limited to colonization factors such as pili and biofilm formation. Certain strain variants of S. gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus and S. infantarius subsp. infantarius are associated with traditional dairy and plant-based food fermentations and display traits suggesting safety. However, due to their close relationship to virulent strains, their use in food fermentation has to be critically assessed. Additionally, implementing accurate and up-to-date taxonomy is critical to enable appropriate treatment of patients and risk assessment of species and strains via recently developed multilocus sequence typing schemes to enable comparative global epidemiology. Comparative genomics revealed that SBSEC strains harbour genomics islands (GI) that seem acquired from other streptococci by horizontal gene transfer. In case of virulent strains these GI frequently encode putative virulence factors, in strains from food fermentation the GI encode functions that are pivotal for strain performance during fermentation. Comparative genomics is a powerful tool to identify acquired pathogenic functions, but there is still an urgent need for more physiological and epidemiological data to understand SBSEC-specific traits.
TI  - [Streptococcus bovis endocarditis as a sign of colon cancer: case report].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Streptococcus bovis is labeled in the literature as a cause of bacteremia and endocarditis, which are often associated with gastrointestinal malignancy. CASE OUTLINE: In our paper we present a patient with endocarditis induced by Streptococcus bovis who was also, after completed cardiologic examination and treatment, diagnosed colon cancer in situ by targeted endoscopy. Owing to the timely diagnosis, and after successful cardiologic surgery with implantation of an artificial aortic valve, patient underwent surgery of the colon, and is now asymptomatic and in good health. CONCLUSION: Complete and detailed endoscopic examination of the colon must be done in patients with endocarditis caused by Streptococcus bovis, even if the patient is asymptomatic. By following these recommendations, it is possible to detect precancerosis or cancer at an early stage and save the patient's life.

TI  - [A case of Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus infective endocarditis  with colon adenoma].
AB  - An 80-year-old Japanese man had a fall presented with a 3-week history of right lumbago exacerbated by body movement as well as a 1-week history of anomalous behavior and appetite loss. He visited our hospital complaining of difficulty in standing up. He had a history of mitral prolapse due to an unknown rupture of the chordae tendineae 3 years earlier, which resulted in moderate mitral valve regurgitation and atrial fibrillation. Upon visiting the hospital, he had petechial hemorrhage and jaundice of the conjunctiva, a systolic murmur (Levine II/VI) at the apex and 4th interspace of the left sternal border, and a positive right straight leg raising test result. Moderate bilirubinemia and disseminated intravascular coagulation which were considered to have been produced secondarily were observed. Infective endocarditis was suspected, and 3 sets of blood culture were extracted. The patient was admitted on the same day. Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (6/6) on the following day. Transesophagela echocardiography was carried out on the same day, and vegetation with a diameter of 4mm was observed in the anterior mitral leaflet; the patient was subsequently diagnosed as having infective endocarditis. Colonic endoscopy was performed after hospitalization. Twelve colonic adenomata were found, and endoscopic mucosal resection was performed on one polyp. The bacterium found in the culture was classified as Streptococcus bovis type I, which causes infective endocarditis and bacteremia. Furthermore, this bacteria is a relatively rare causative organism of infective endocarditis. Tolerance to macrolide and tetracycline are reported in the literature. Moreover, the cell wall of this bacterium may have low pathogenicity as well as cause chronic inflammation in the large intestine mucous membrane, colonic polyps, and colorectal cancer. Several colonic adenomata and a partial shift to a malignant pathology were observed in this case. When this bacterium is detected, searching for a pathological change in the large intestine is believed to be indispensable.
TI  - A Study on the Nature of Association between Demodex Mites and Bacteria Involved  in Skin and Meibomian Gland Lesions of Demodectic Mange in Cattle.
AB  - The nature of association between Demodex mites and bacteria involved in bovine demodectic mange lesions and the normal flora inhabiting the skin of noninfected animals was investigated. Demodex bovis and D. ghanensis mites were isolated from the infected purulent material extracted from skin and meibomian gland lesions, respectively. The mites could not be demonstrated in skin brushings or impression smears from the eyes of noninfected cattle. Pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A)) and opportunistic organisms (Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Trueperella pyogenes) were isolated from skin lesions of demodectic mange, and Moraxella bovis and Staphylococcus aureus were isolated from meibomian gland lesions. Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A) were isolated from skin brushings from noninfected cattle. The nature of association between Demodex mites and bacteria in demodectic mange lesions is synergistic and of equal significance. Pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria facilitated the establishment of Demodex mites in the lesions produced and provided an excellent microclimate for the mites to propagate and reproduce, resulting in severe and progressive disease. The "high-turnover" granulomatous reaction which characterized the histopathological changes proved that Demodex mites and associated bacteria were persistent and immunogenic.
TI  - Effects of pathogen-specific clinical mastitis on probability of conception in Holstein dairy cows.
AB  - The objective of this study was to estimate the effects of pathogen-specific clinical mastitis (CM), occurring in different weekly intervals before or after artificial insemination (AI), on the probability of conception in Holstein cows. Clinical mastitis occurring in weekly intervals from 6 wk before until 6 wk after AI was modeled. The first 4 AI in a cow's lactation were included. The following categories of pathogens were studied: Streptococcus spp. (comprising Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, and other Streptococcus spp.); Staphylococcus aureus; coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS); Escherichia coli; Klebsiella spp.; cases with CM signs but no bacterial growth (above the level that can be detected from our microbiological procedures) observed in the culture sample and cases with contamination (>/= 3 pathogens in the sample); and other pathogens [including Citrobacter, yeasts, Trueperella pyogenes, gram-negative bacilli (i.e., gram-negative organisms other than E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter, and Citrobacter), Corynebacterium bovis, Corynebacterium spp., Pasteurella, Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, Mycoplasma, Prototheca, and others]. Other factors included in the model were parity (1, 2, 3, 4 and higher), season of AI (winter, spring, summer, autumn), day in lactation of first AI, farm, and other non-CM diseases (retained placenta, metritis, ketosis, displaced abomasum). Data from 90,271 AI in 39,361 lactations in 20,328 cows collected from 2003/2004 to 2011 from 5 New York State dairy farms were analyzed in a generalized linear mixed model with a Poisson distribution. The largest reductions in probability of conception were associated with CM occurring in the week before AI or in the 2 wk following AI. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. had the greatest adverse effects on probability of conception. The probability of conception for a cow with any combination of characteristics may be calculated based on the parameter estimates. These findings may be helpful to farmers in assessing reproduction in their dairy cows for more effective cow management.
TI  - Bovicin HC5 and nisin reduce Staphylococcus aureus adhesion to polystyrene and change the hydrophobicity profile and Gibbs free energy of adhesion.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen often multidrug-resistant that not only causes a variety of human diseases, but also is able to survive on biotic and abiotic surfaces through biofilm communities. The best way to inhibit biofilm establishment is to prevent cell adhesion. In the present study, subinhibitory concentrations of the bacteriocins bovicin HC5 and nisin were tested for their capability to interfere with the adhesion of S. aureus to polystyrene. Subinhibitory dosages of the bacteriocins reduced cell adhesion and this occurred probably due to changes in the hydrophobicity of the bacterial cell and polystyrene surfaces. After treatment with bovicin HC5 and nisin, the surfaces became more hydrophilic and the free energy of adhesion (G(adhesion)) between bacteria and the polystyrene surface was unfavorable. The transcriptional level of selected genes was assessed by RT-qPCR approach, revealing that the bacteriocins affected the expression of some important biofilm associated genes (icaD, fnbA, and clfB) and rnaIII, which is involved in the quorum sensing mechanism. The conditioning of food-contact surfaces with bacteriocins can be an innovative and powerful strategy to prevent biofilms in the food industry. The results are relevant for food safety as they indicate that bovicin HC5 and nisin can inhibit bacterial adhesion and consequent biofilm establishment, since cell adhesion precedes biofilm formation.
TI  - Characterization of rumen bacterial strains isolated from enrichments of rumen content in the presence of propolis.
AB  - Propolis presents many biological properties, including antibacterial activities, and has been proposed as an additive in ruminant nutrition. Twenty bacterial strains, previously isolated from enrichments of Brazilian cow rumen contents in the presence of different propolis extracts (LLOS), were characterized using phenotyping and 16S rRNA identification. Seven strains were assigned to Streptococcus sp., most likely S. bovis, and were all degrading starch. One amylolytic lactate-utilizing strain of Selenomonas ruminantium was also found. Two strains of Clostridium bifermentans were identified and showed proteolytic activity. Two strains were assigned to Mitsuokella jalaludinii and were saccharolytic. One strain belonged to a Bacillus species and seven strains were affiliated with Escherichia coli. All of the 20 strains were able to use many sugars, but none of them were able to degrade the polysaccharides carboxymethylcellulose and xylans. The effect of three propolis extracts (LLOS B1, C1 and C3) was tested on the in vitro growth of four representative isolates of S. bovis, E. coli, M. jalaludinii and C. bifermentans. The growth of S. bovis, E. coli and M. jalaludinii was not affected by the three propolis extracts at 1 mg ml(-1). C. bifermentans growth was completely inhibited at this LLOS concentration, but this bacterium was partially resistant at lower concentrations. LLOS C3, with the lower concentration of phenolic compounds, was a little less inhibitory than B1 and C1 on this strain.
TI  - Childhood meningitis caused by Streptococcus bovis group: clinical and biologic data during a 12-year period in France.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial meningitis (BM) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children. Sporadic cases of Streptococcus bovis have been described in neonates and infants. To assess the epidemiologic, clinical and biologic characteristics of this meningitis, we used the French Surveillance Network for BM in children. METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-seven pediatric wards working with 168 microbiology departments throughout France were asked to report all cases of BM in patients <18 years. Diagnosis was based on a combination of fever, meningeal signs and a positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture and/or a positive polymerase chain reaction in the CSF and/or positive blood culture associated with pleiocytosis. RESULTS: Among 4806 cases of BM recorded in 12 years (2001-2012), 23 cases were caused by S. bovis (0.5%). All were infants. Among them, 15 cases (65.2%) occurred in the neonatal period. The majority occurred in premature infants (73.9%). In 21 cases, the diagnosis was based on a positive CSF culture. Blood culture was positive in 17 children. When S. bovis subtype was identified, it was type 2 (Streptococcus gallolyticus pasteurianus) in 80% of cases. All infants received antibiotic therapy with parenteral penicillin and/or third-generation cephalosporin combined with an aminoglycoside. The duration of treatment ranged from 10 to 25 days. Of the 23 patients, 17 (73.9%) had a second lumbar puncture and in all those cases, the CSF was sterile. No deaths or neurologic complications were reported. CONCLUSION: BM due to S. bovis is rare and primarily affects infants, particularly premature infants. Antibiotic treatment is effective with low morbidity and mortality.

TI  - Acute septicemia caused by Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus in turkey poults.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus, previously known as Streptococcus bovis biotypes I and II/2, is a well-known cause of sepsis and meningitis in humans and birds. The present case report describes an outbreak of fatal septicemia associated with S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (S. bovis biotype II/2) in 11 turkey flocks in Pennsylvania between 2010 and 2013. Affected poults were 2-3 wk of age. Major clinical observation was sudden increase in mortality among turkey poults without any premonitory clinical signs. Postmortem examination findings revealed acute septicemia with lesions such as fibrinous pericarditis, meningitis, splenic multifocal fibrinoid necrosis, hepatitis, osteochondritis, myositis, and airsacculitis. Gram-positive cocci were isolated from several organs by routine bacterial culture. Biotyping identified bacteria as streptococci, whereas 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing identified them as S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus. Antibiotic susceptibility profiles revealed that all the strains isolated were sensitive to penicillin and erythromycin with different sensitivity profiles for other antibacterial agents tested. The present study reports the first confirmed case of acute septicemia in turkey poults caused by S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus.
TI  - Dissecting the catalytic and substrate binding activity of a class II lanthipeptide synthetase BovM.
AB  - LanM proteins are the synthetases of the class II lanthipeptides, which are responsible for lanthionine or methyllanthionine formation in lanthipeptides. LanMs are bifunctional enzymes with N-terminal dehydratase and C-terminal cyclase domains. However, the catalytic and especially the substrate binding function of LanM are not fully investigated. In this study, we analyzed the function of conserved residues of BovM, which is the synthetase of lanthipeptide bovicin HJ50, with alanine substitution method. Mass spectrometry (MS) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analyses showed six hydrophilic residues (e.g. Asp247) were involved in the dehydration activity of BovM and four hydrophobic residues (e.g. Ile254) were responsible for the substrate binding of BovM. In addition, a conserved Asp155 was proposed to be general base in the elimination of phosphates during the dehydration reactions. This research of BovM shed a light on the catalytic and substrate binding mechanism of LanM proteins.
TI  - Comparative genomics of the bacterial genus Streptococcus illuminates evolutionary implications of species groups.
AB  - Members of the genus Streptococcus within the phylum Firmicutes are among the most diverse and significant zoonotic pathogens. This genus has gone through considerable taxonomic revision due to increasing improvements of chemotaxonomic approaches, DNA hybridization and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. It is proposed to place the majority of streptococci into "species groups". However, the evolutionary implications of species groups are not clear presently. We use comparative genomic approaches to yield a better understanding of the evolution of Streptococcus through genome dynamics, population structure, phylogenies and virulence factor distribution of species groups. Genome dynamics analyses indicate that the pan-genome size increases with the addition of newly sequenced strains, while the core genome size decreases with sequential addition at the genus level and species group level. Population structure analysis reveals two distinct lineages, one including Pyogenic, Bovis, Mutans and Salivarius groups, and the other including Mitis, Anginosus and Unknown groups. Phylogenetic dendrograms show that species within the same species group cluster together, and infer two main clades in accordance with population structure analysis. Distribution of streptococcal virulence factors has no obvious patterns among the species groups; however, the evolution of some common virulence factors is congruous with the evolution of species groups, according to phylogenetic inference. We suggest that the proposed streptococcal species groups are reasonable from the viewpoints of comparative genomics; evolution of the genus is congruent with the individual evolutionary trajectories of different species groups.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis bacteremia as the initial presentation of carcinoma of the gallbladder.
AB  - There is a well known association between Streptococcus bovis infection and the presence of a coexisting colonic adenocarcinoma. Association of S. bovis with other malignancies has only been rarely reported. We report a 77-year-old male who presented with with Streptococcus bovis bacteremia in the setting of acute cholecystitis. Given the association of colon adenocarcinoma and Streptococcus bovis bacteremia, colonoscopy was performed prior to cholecystectomy to evaluate a possible coexisting colon neoplasm, which was negative. At cholecystectomy, the patient was found to have a carcinoma of the gallbladder, which was treated with radical cholecystectomy and periportal lymphadenectomy. This is the first case of Streptococcus bovis infection and coexisting gallbladder cancer to be reported, and highlights the need for maintenance of a high index of suspicion for malignancies other than colon cancer when patients present with Streptococcus bovis bacteremia.
TI  - In vitro thrombolytic activity of purified streptokinase extracted from Streptococcus equinus VIT_VB2 isolated from bovine milk.
AB  - Streptokinase (SK) is an extracellular enzyme secreted by various strains of beta-hemolytic Streptococci. The main focus of the current study is to evaluate the in vitro thrombolytic activity of purified SK extracted from Streptococcus equinus VIT_VB2 (Accession no. JX406835) isolated from milk sample. The growth rate of S. equinus VIT_VB2 strain was studied with pH and biomass content which has positive significant effect on enzyme yield. A temperature of 10 degrees C and pH of 6 was found to be optimum for maximum SK activity. The specific activity of the purified SK produced by VIT_VB2 strain was found to be 6,585 IU mg(-1). The molecular mass of the enzyme was determined as 47 kDa by SDS-PAGE. In vitro thrombolytic activity of purified SK was determined using synthetic chromogenic substrate S-2251, the activity of the purified enzyme was found to be 6,330 +/- 2.2 IU. The purity of SK was compared with standard SK by HPLC. This is the first report which reveals the SK activity of S. equinus isolated from milk sample.
TI  - Ruminal bacterial community shifts in grain-, sugar-, and histidine-challenged dairy heifers.
AB  - Ruminal bacterial community composition (BCC) and its associations with ruminal fermentation measures were studied in dairy heifers challenged with combinations of grain, fructose, and histidine in a partial factorial study. Holstein-Friesian heifers (n=30) were randomly allocated to 5 triticale grain-based treatment groups: (1) control (no grain), (2) grain [fed at a dry matter intake (DMI) of 1.2% of body weight (BW)], (3) grain (0.8% of BW DMI) + fructose (0.4% of BW DMI), (4) grain (1.2% of BW DMI) + histidine (6g/head), and (5) grain (0.8% of BW DMI) + fructose (0.4% of BW DMI) + histidine (6g/head). Ruminal fluid was collected using a stomach tube 5, 115, and 215min after consumption of the rations and bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA sequence data was analyzed to characterize bacteria. Large variation among heifers and distinct BCC were evident in a between-group constrained principal components analysis. Bacterial composition in the fructose-fed heifers was positively related to total lactate and butyrate concentrations. Bacterial composition was positively associated with ruminal ammonia, valerate, and histamine concentrations in the grain-fed heifers. The predominant phyla were the Firmicutes (57.6% of total recovered sequences), Bacteroidetes (32.0%), and candidate phylum TM7 (4.0%). Prevotella was the dominant genus. In general, grain or histidine or their interactions with time had minimal effects on the relative abundance of bacterial phyla and families. Fructose increased and decreased the relative abundance of the Firmicutes and Proteobacteria phyla over time, respectively, and decreased the abundance of the Prevotellaceae family over time. The relative abundance of the Streptococcaceae and Veillonellaceae families was increased in the fructose-fed heifers and these heifers over time. A total of 31 operational taxonomic units differed among treatment groups in the 3.6h sampling period, Streptococcus bovis was observed in fructose fed animals. The TM7 candidate phylum had an increased abundance of sequence reads by over 2.5 fold due to the introduction of histidine into the diet. Rapid changes in BCC can occur in a short period after a single substrate challenge and the nature of these changes may influence ruminal acidosis risk and differ from those in cattle exposed to substrate challenges over a longer time period.
TI  - Comparison of clinical features of left-sided infective endocarditis involving previously normal versus previously abnormal valves.
AB  - Native valve infective endocarditis (IE) in patients with normal valves has increased in the last decades. Whether patients with normal valves present a similar prognosis to those with pathologic valves is unresolved. Our aim is to describe epidemiologic and clinical differences between patients with left-sided IE and normal valves and those with native pathologic valves. We analyzed 945 consecutive episodes of IE, 435 of which involved left-sided nonprosthetic IE. They were classified into 2 groups: episodes in normal valves (normal group, n=173) and episodes in pathologic valves (abnormal group, n=262). Patients in the normal group were younger, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus bovis were more frequently isolated, and vegetations were more frequently found. Heart failure, septic shock, and the need for surgery or death were more common. Multivariate analysis identified the following as factors independently associated with normal valve IE: age<65 years, S bovis, S aureus, heart failure, and vegetation detection. Factors independently associated with in-hospital events included S aureus, periannular complications, heart failure, and septic shock development. In conclusion, compared with patients with abnormal valve IE, patients with IE on normal valves were younger, had a more virulent microbiological profile, developed heart failure and septic shock more frequently, needed more surgical procedures, and had worse prognosis.
TI  - Streptococcus viridians bacteraemia and colonic adenocarcinoma.
AB  - Even though Streptococcus bacteraemia is an infrequent presentation of colonic malignancies, there is a well-established link between Streptococcus bovis bacteraemia and colonic malignancies. Most of the physicians are well aware of this correlation and further workup is pursued in most of the cases. However, many physicians may not be aware that other species of Streptococcus viridians, other than S. bovis, can be associated with colonic malignancies. In this case report, we present a case of Streptococcus viridians (anginosus) bacteraemia as a complication of an undiagnosed sigmoid adenocarcinoma. While further evidence is needed to warrant a gastrointestinal (GI) workup in a patient with other species of Streptococcus viridians bacteraemia, we would like to increase the awareness in the physicians' community regarding Streptococcus viridians, other than S. bovis bacteraemia. This would be especially relevant for patients who have no GI screening, as Streptococcus viridians bacteraemia can be an early sign of colonic neoplasm.
TI  - Analysis of bacterial communities and bacterial pathogens in a biogas plant by the combination of ethidium monoazide, PCR and Ion Torrent sequencing.
AB  - The present study investigated the changes of bacterial community composition including bacterial pathogens along a biogas plant, i.e. from the influent, to the biogas reactor and to the post-digester. The effects of post-digestion temperature and time on the changes of bacterial community composition and bacterial pathogens were also studied. Microbial analysis was made by Ion Torrent sequencing of the PCR amplicons from ethidium monoazide treated samples, and ethidium monoazide was used to cleave DNA from dead cells and exclude it from PCR amplification. Both similarity and taxonomic analysis showed that the bacterial community composition in the influent was changed after anaerobic digestion. Firmicutes were dominant in all the samples, while Proteobacteria decreased in the biogas reactor compared with the influent. Variations of bacterial community composition in the biogas reactor with time were also observed. This could be attributed to varying composition of the influent. Batch experiments showed that the methane recovery from the digested residues (obtained from biogas reactor) was mainly related with post-digestion temperature. However, post-digestion time rather than temperature had a significant effect on the changes of bacterial community composition. The changes of bacterial community composition were also reflected in the changes of relative abundance of bacterial pathogens. The richness and relative abundance of bacterial pathogens were reduced after anaerobic digestion in the biogas reactor. It was found in batch experiments that bacterial pathogens showed the highest relative abundance and richness after 30 days' post-digestion. Streptococcus bovis was found in all the samples. Our results showed that special attention should be paid to the post-digestion since the increase in relative abundance of bacterial pathogens after post-digestion might reflect regrowth of bacterial pathogens and limit biosolids disposal vectors.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis infection and colorectal neoplasia: a meta-analysis.
AB  - AIM: A meta-analysis was conducted to determine the risk associated with Streptococcus bovis infection and the occurrence of colorectal neoplasia (CRN). The level of risk remains unknown. METHOD: We conducted a search of MEDLINE, PubMed and EMBASE up to January 2014. We used a random-effects model to analyse the data. RESULTS: We identified 48 studies concerning three main topics: S. bovis septicaemia, S. bovis endocarditis and S. bovis faecal carriage. The total sample sizes were 1729, 807 and 1145, respectively; the 48 studies included 9 case-control studies and 39 case series. Overall, the presence of S. bovis infection was found to be significantly associated with the presence of CRN. Streptococcus bovis endocarditis showed the strongest association in analyses of case-control studies and case series (OR 14.54, 95% CI 5.66-37.35, test for heterogeneity I2 = 43.53; event rate of 0.53, 95% CI 0.45-0.61, test for heterogeneity I2 = 53.50). Similarly, S. bovis septicaemia was also associated with a high level of concurrence with CRN (OR 7.48, 95% CI 3.10-18.06, test for heterogeneity I(2) = 43.32; event rate 0.49, 95% CI 0.42-0.56, test for heterogeneity I2 = 69.97). Patients with CRN were found to have a higher incidence of S. bovis in faeces upon stool culture (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.14-5.58, test for heterogeneity I2 = 69.17). CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis showed a statistically significant association between the presence of S. bovis endocarditis or S. bovis septicaemia and CRN. Furthermore, there is a statistically significant increase in likelihood of finding S. bovis in the stool of individuals with CRN.
TI  - Bovicin HJ50-like lantibiotics, a novel subgroup of lantibiotics featured by an indispensable disulfide bridge.
AB  - Lantibiotics are ribosomally-synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides with potent antimicrobial activities. Discovery of novel lantibiotics has been greatly accelerated with the soaring release of genomic information of microorganisms. As a unique class II lantibiotic, bovicin HJ50 is produced by Streptococcus bovis HJ50 and contains one rare disulfide bridge. By using its precursor BovA as a drive sequence, 16 BovA-like peptides were revealed in a wide variety of species. From them, three representative novel lan loci from Clostridium perfringens D str. JGS1721, Bacillus cereus As 1.348 and B. thuringiensis As 1.013 were identified by PCR screening. The corresponding mature lantibiotics designated perecin, cerecin and thuricin were obtained and structurally elucidated to be bovicin HJ50-like lantibiotics especially by containing a conserved disulfide bridge. The disulfide bridge was substantiated to be essential for the function of bovicin HJ50-like lantibiotics as its disruption eliminated their antimicrobial activities. Further analysis indicated that the disulfide bridge played a crucial role in maintaining the hydrophobicity of bovicin HJ50, which might facilitate it to exert antimicrobial function. This study unveiled a novel subgroup of disulfide-containing lantibiotics from bacteria of different niches and further demonstrated the indispensable role of disulfide bridge in these novel bovicin HJ50-like lantibiotics.
TI  - Type AII lantibiotic bovicin HJ50 with a rare disulfide bond: structure, structure-activity relationships and mode of action.
AB  - Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides containing unusual amino acids. As promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics, they have a high potential for alleviating the problem of emergent antibiotic resistance, with possible applications in many industries that have antibacterial demand. Bovicin HJ50 is a type AII lantibiotic, the largest group of lantibiotics, comprising a linear N-terminal region and a globular C-terminal region. Interestingly, bovicin H50 has a disulfide bond that is rare in this group. Owing to limited information about the spatial structures of type AII lantibiotics, the functional regions of this type and the role of the disulfide bond are still unknown. In the present study, we resolved the solution structure of bovicin HJ50 using NMR spectroscopy. This is the first spatial structure of a type AII lantibiotic. Bovicin HJ50 exhibited high flexibility in aqueous solution, whereas varied rigidities were observed in the different rings with the conserved ring A being the most rigid. The charged residues Lys(1)(1), Asp(1)(2) and Lys(3)(0), as well as the essential disulfide bond were critical for antimicrobial activity. Importantly, bovicin HJ50 showed not only peptidoglycan precursor lipid II-binding ability, but also pore-forming activity, which is significantly different from other bacteriostatic type AII lantibiotics, suggesting a novel antimicrobial mechanism.
TI  - Infective endocarditis caused by Streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus and colon cancer.
AB  - A 56-year-old man presented to our department with a 2-month history of fever and chills. He had received a mitral valvuloplasty 3 years ago. He had been administered levofloxacin for 2 months. We discontinued levofloxacin and repeated the blood cultures. Bacterial blood cultures were positive and transoesophageal echocardiography revealed vegetation attached to the posterior mitral leaflet. We started the patient on intravenous antibiotic therapy for infectious endocarditis by Streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus. A colonoscopic screening revealed adenomatoid intracellular carcinoma. Previous studies have reported a weak association between colorectal cancer and Streptococcus bovis biotype II/2, which includes S gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus; however, the rate is notably higher than the rate of colorectal cancer as indicated by positive faecal occult-blood test results. We conclude that colonoscopies should be routine while scanning for colorectal cancer in all patients with S bovis bacteraemia, regardless of the subspecies.
TI  - Development and application of a multilocus sequence typing scheme for Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (formerly known as S. bovis biotype I) is a commensal of the gastrointestinal tract in animals and in up to 15% of healthy humans. Furthermore, it is a facultative pathogen that can cause infectious endocarditis, mastitis, and septicemia. The number of infections is increasing, but the transmission routes and zoonotic potential remain unknown. To assess the zoonotic potential and characterize the epidemiological structure of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, we established a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme. We amplified and sequenced internal fragments of seven housekeeping genes. The resulting sequences were analyzed with BioNumerics software 6.6 by using the unweighted-pair group method using average linkages algorithm. A total of 101 S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strains isolated from animals, humans, and environmental samples were analyzed and divided into 50 sequence types. Our first results highlight the importance of this MLST scheme for investigating the epidemiology, transmission patterns, and infection chains of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus.
TI  - Inhibition of fructan-fermenting equine faecal bacteria and Streptococcus bovis by hops (Humulus lupulus L.) beta-acid.
AB  - AIMS: The goals of this study were to determine if beta-acid from hops (Humulus lupulus L.) could be used to control fructan fermentation by equine hindgut micro-organisms, and to verify the antimicrobial mode of action on Streptococcus bovis, which has been implicated in fructan fermentation, hindgut acidosis and pasture-associated laminitis (PAL) in the horse. METHODS AND RESULTS: Suspensions of uncultivated equine faecal micro-organisms produced fermentation acids when inulin (model fructan) was the substrate, but beta-acid (i.e. lupulone) concentrations >/=9 ppm inhibited lactate production and mitigated the decrease in pH. Inulin-fermenting Strep. bovis was isolated from the beta-acid-free suspensions after enrichment with inulin. The isolates were sensitive to beta-acid, which decreased the viable number of streptococci in faecal suspensions, as well as growth, lactate production and the intracellular potassium of Strep. bovis in pure culture. CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with the hypothesis that hops beta-acid prevented the growth of fructan-fermenting equine faecal bacteria, and that the mechanism of action was dissipation of the intracellular potassium of Strep. bovis. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Bacterial hindgut fermentation of grass fructans has been linked to PAL and other metabolic disorders in horses. Hops beta-acid is a potential phytochemical intervention to decrease the growth of bacteria responsible for PAL.
TI  - Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus meningitis in an infant.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus was formerly classified as S. bovis biotype II/2, which is recognized as a rare cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis. Since the taxonomy classification change, there have not been many reports of meningitis due to S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus. Moreover, the pathogenesis of late onset S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus meningitis in infants is unclear. Here we report a case of meningitis in a 5-week-old infant with preceding diarrhea. S. bovis biotype II/2 was isolated from the blood, cerebrospinal fluid and stool, and then was identified as S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus on 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Isolates from all three sample types had identical profiles on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The intestinal tract was thought to be the source of the infection.
TI  - Comparative genomics of the dairy isolate Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198 against related members of the Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Within the genus Streptococcus, only Streptococcus thermophilus is used as a starter culture in food fermentations. Streptococcus macedonicus though, which belongs to the Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex (SBSEC), is also frequently isolated from fermented foods mainly of dairy origin. Members of the SBSEC have been implicated in human endocarditis and colon cancer. Here we compare the genome sequence of the dairy isolate S. macedonicus ACA-DC 198 to the other SBSEC genomes in order to assess in silico its potential adaptation to milk and its pathogenicity status. RESULTS: Despite the fact that the SBSEC species were found tightly related based on whole genome phylogeny of streptococci, two distinct patterns of evolution were identified among them. Streptococcus macedonicus, Streptococcus infantarius CJ18 and Streptococcus pasteurianus ATCC 43144 seem to have undergone reductive evolution resulting in significantly diminished genome sizes and increased percentages of potential pseudogenes when compared to Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus. In addition, the three species seem to have lost genes for catabolizing complex plant carbohydrates and for detoxifying toxic substances previously linked to the ability of S. gallolyticus to survive in the rumen. Analysis of the S. macedonicus genome revealed features that could support adaptation to milk, including an extra gene cluster for lactose and galactose metabolism, a proteolytic system for casein hydrolysis, auxotrophy for several vitamins, an increased ability to resist bacteriophages and horizontal gene transfer events with the dairy Lactococcus lactis and S. thermophilus as potential donors. In addition, S. macedonicus lacks several pathogenicity-related genes found in S. gallolyticus. For example, S. macedonicus has retained only one (i.e. the pil3) of the three pilus gene clusters which may mediate the binding of S. gallolyticus to the extracellular matrix. Unexpectedly, similar findings were obtained not only for the dairy S. infantarius CJ18, but also for the blood isolate S. pasteurianus ATCC 43144. CONCLUSIONS: Our whole genome analyses suggest traits of adaptation of S. macedonicus to the nutrient-rich dairy environment. During this process the bacterium gained genes presumably important for this new ecological niche. Finally, S. macedonicus carries a reduced number of putative SBSEC virulence factors, which suggests a diminished pathogenic potential.
TI  - Antimicrobial constituents and synergism effect of the essential oils from Cymbopogon citratus and Alpinia galanga.
AB  - From the fresh leaf sheathes of lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus) and rhizomes of  galanga (Alpinia galanga) light yellow and colorless oils, respectively, were obtained by hydrodistillation and microwave assisted extraction (MAE) in yields of 0.24% and 0.03%, and 0.11% and trace (w/w), respectively. By GC/MS analysis, five major constituents were identified in lemongrass oil, E-citral, Z-citral, beta-myrcene, selina-6-en-4-ol, and cis-ocimene, and five in galanga oil, 1,8-cineole, phenol 4-(2-propenyl)-acetate, dl-limonene, alpha-pinene, and a-terpineol. Three major components of the combined lemongrass and galanga oils (ratio 7:3, 1:1, 3:7) were 1,8-cineole (46.3%, 31.5%, 19.3%), E-citral (12.8%, 22.7%, 32.8%) and Z-citral (8.5%, 15.2%, 21.6%). The MICs of lemongrass and galanga oils were: against Staphylococcus aureus 0.5% and 4%, v/v, against Pseudomonas aeruginosa 40% and >40%,v/v, against Streptococcus bovis 0.25% and 0.5%, v/v, and against Candida albicans 0.25% and 0.5%, v/v. Citral (from lemongrass oil) gave greater potentiation than 1,8-cineole (from galanga oil). The combination profiles of galanga oil with lemongrass oil (volume ratios 3:7, 1:1, and 7:3) were tested against the four pathogenic microorganisms. Synergistic activity was best noted for only one ratio (volume ratio 3:7) as the sigmafic< 1 against all tested microorganisms. The present investigation provides evidenc that the utilization of two essential oils in combination should be assessed for synergistic antimicrobial activity in order to reduce their minimum effective dose.

TI  - Prognostic implications of diabetes in patients with left-sided endocarditis: findings from a large cohort study.
AB  - Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) have a higher incidence of infections, and those with bacteremia are more prone to develop sepsis and infective endocarditis (IE). Nevertheless, data concerning the impact of DM on the prognosis of patients with IE are limited and sometimes contradictory. We examined the impact of DM on the inhospital outcome of left-sided IE in a large cohort of patients. We studied 594 consecutive episodes of left-sided IE diagnosed at 3 tertiary care centers. They were divided into 2 groups: episodes in patients with DM (n = 114) and episodes in patients without DM (n = 480). We retrospectively analyzed the influence of DM therapy on patient outcome. Compared to patients without DM, patients with DM were older (67 +/- 10 vs. 60 +/- 15 yr; p < 0.001), less frequently male (53.5% vs. 67.9%; p = 0.004), and more commonly had chronic renal failure (23.9% vs. 6.9%; p < 0.001) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (14.6% vs. 7.8%; p = 0.019). Enterococcus (14.9% vs. 7.4%; p = 0.011) and Streptococcus bovis (8.8% vs. 3.8%; p = 0.024) were isolated more frequently. In the univariable analysis, septic shock (29.2% vs. 16.4%; p = 0.005) and mortality (43.5% vs. 30.0%; p = 0.008) were more common among patients with DM than in those without. Considering the different treatments for DM, septic shock (33.3%; p = 0.011) and death (50.8%; p = 0.012) were more frequent in patients receiving oral medication to treat diabetes than in patients with the other treatment modalities. However, multivariable analysis showed that DM had an independent association with development of septic shock (OR 2.282; 95% CI 1.186-4.393), but it was not a predictor of inhospital mortality.Staphylococci were the most frequently involved microorganisms in all patients; however, Enterococcus and Streptococcus bovis were more frequently isolated from individuals with DM and left-sided IE, whereas viridans group streptococci were more commonly isolated from those with left-sided IE who did not have DM. DM was independently associated with the development of septic shock, but it was not an independent predictor of inhospital mortality in patients with left-sided IE.
TI  - Bacteraemia due to Streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus is associated with digestive tract malignancies and resistance to macrolides and clindamycin.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was intended to delineate the association between digestive tract malignancies and bacteraemia due to Streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records and microbiological results of patients with bacteraemia due to Streptococcus bovis during the period 2000-2012. Species and subspecies identification of isolates originally classified as S. bovis was confirmed by 16S rRNA sequencing and PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assays. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of antimicrobial agents were determined by the broth microdilution method. RESULTS: Of the 172 S. bovis complex isolates obtained from 172 patients (age range, <1-94 years, median age, 66) with bacteraemia, 31 isolates were identified to be S. gallolyticus subspecies gallolyticus, 126 were S. gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus, and 15 were shown to be Streptococcus infantarius. The majority (n = 104, 60%) of patients were male and had underlying malignancies (n = 87, 51%). Bacteraemia due to S. gallolyticus subspecies gallolyticus was significantly associated with endocarditis while S. gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus was more likely to be associated with malignancies of the digestive tract, including gastric, pancreatic, hepatobiliary and colorectal cancers. Septic shock at presentation was the only factor associated with mortality among patients with bacteraemia due to either subspecies of S. bovis. Isolates of S. gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus had higher rates of resistance to macrolides and clindamycin than isolates of S. gallolyticus subspecies gallolyticus. CONCLUSION: Extensive diagnostic work-up for digestive tract malignancies and trans-esophageal echocardiogram should be investigated in patients with bacteraemia caused by S. gallolyticus.
TI  - Novel Bartonella infection in northern and southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris kenyoni and Enhydra lutris nereis).
AB  - Since 2002, vegetative valvular endocarditis (VVE), septicemia and meningoencephalitis have contributed to an Unusual Mortality Event (UME) of northern sea otters in southcentral Alaska. Streptococcal organisms were commonly isolated from vegetative lesions and organs from these sea otters. Bartonella infection has also been associated with bacteremia and VVE in terrestrial mammals, but little is known regarding its pathogenic significance in marine mammals. Our study evaluated whether Streptococcus bovis/equinus (SB/E) and Bartonella infections were associated with UME-related disease characterized by VVE and septicemia in Alaskan sea otter carcasses recovered 2004-2008. These bacteria were also evaluated in southern sea otters in California. Streptococcus bovis/equinus were cultured from 45% (23/51) of northern sea otter heart valves, and biochemical testing and sequencing identified these isolates as Streptococcus infantarius subsp. coli. One-third of sea otter hearts were co-infected with Bartonella spp. Our analysis demonstrated that SB/E was strongly associated with UME-related disease in northern sea otters (P<0.001). While Bartonella infection was also detected in 45% (23/51) and 10% (3/30) of heart valves of northern and southern sea otters examined, respectively, it was not associated with disease. Phylogenetic analysis of the Bartonella ITS region allowed detection of two Bartonella species, one novel species closely related to Bartonella spp. JM-1, B. washoensis and Candidatus B. volans and another molecularly identical to B. henselae. Our findings help to elucidate the role of pathogens in northern sea otter mortalities during this UME and suggested that Bartonella spp. is common in sea otters from Alaska and California.

TI  - Phylogenomics and the dynamic genome evolution of the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - The genus Streptococcus comprises important pathogens that have a severe impact on human health and are responsible for substantial economic losses to agriculture. Here, we utilize 46 Streptococcus genome sequences (44 species), including eight species sequenced here, to provide the first genomic level insight into the evolutionary history and genetic basis underlying the functional diversity of all major groups of this genus. Gene gain/loss analysis revealed a dynamic pattern of genome evolution characterized by an initial period of gene gain followed by a period of loss, as the major groups within the genus diversified. This was followed by a period of genome expansion associated with the origins of the present extant species. The pattern is concordant with an emerging view that genomes evolve through a dynamic process of expansion and streamlining. A large proportion of the pan-genome has experienced lateral gene transfer (LGT) with causative factors, such as relatedness and shared environment, operating over different evolutionary scales. Multiple gene ontology terms were significantly enriched for each group, and mapping terms onto the phylogeny showed that those corresponding to genes born on branches leading to the major groups represented approximately one-fifth of those enriched. Furthermore, despite the extensive LGT, several biochemical characteristics have been retained since group formation, suggesting genomic cohesiveness through time, and that these characteristics may be fundamental to each group. For example, proteolysis: mitis group; urea metabolism: salivarius group; carbohydrate metabolism: pyogenic group; and transcription regulation: bovis group.
TI  - Is there a need for bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis in patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy?
AB  - Heart valve repair or replacement is a serious problem. Patients can benefit from an open dialogue between both cardiologists and gastroenterologists for the optimal effective patients care. The focused update on infective endocarditis of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2008 (ACC/AHA guidelines) and guidelines on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infective endocarditis (new version 2009) of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC guidelines) describe prophylaxis against infective endocarditis (IE) as not recommended for gastroscopy and colonoscopy in the absence of active infection but increasing evidence suggests that the role of IE antibiotic prophylaxis remains a dark side of the cardio-oncology prevention. New evidences concerning infective endocarditis due to Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, and new findings indicate that there is a need for bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis in patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy especially in elderly patients and in cancer and immunocompromised patients, to avoid serious consequences.
TI  - Keeping track of migratory pulmonary lesions.
AB  - Tricuspid valve endocarditis (TVE) is rarely considered in the differential diagnosis of a febrile patient who does not use intravenous drugs.We describe the case of a 62-year-old male patient with a 3-month history of remittent fever and 13% weight loss. The patient denied intravenous drugs use or recent invasive procedures. His medical history included type 2 diabetes, alcohol abuse and smoking. Clinical evaluation revealed systemic inflammatory syndrome with unremarkable physical examination. Ancillary tests showed leucocytosis, thrombocytopenia and elevated C reactive protein. Empiric intravenous ceftriaxone was started, but after an initial improvement, fever relapsed 2 days after stopping antibiotherapy. A CT scan showed multiple disseminated lesions, suggesting lung metastatic tumour. Further studies excluded malignancy and revealed TVE caused by Streptococcus bovis with pulmonary embolism. The aim of our study is to stress the importance of evoking TVE in the differential diagnosis of fever with lung manifestations, and to highlight the possible association between S bovis, colorectal cancer and liver disease.
TI  - Susceptibility of 45 Streptococcus bovis isolates to five antibiotic agents.
AB  
TI  - Identification of ligand specificity determinants in lantibiotic bovicin HJ50 and the receptor BovK, a multitransmembrane histidine kinase.
AB  - Lantibiotic bovicin HJ50 is produced by Streptococcus bovis HJ50 and acts as the  extracellular signal to autoregulate its own biosynthesis through BovK/R two-component system. Bovicin HJ50 shows a linear N-terminal and glubolar C-terminal structure, and the sensor histidine kinase BovK contains eight transmembrane segments lacking any extensive surface-exposed sensory domain. The signal recognition mechanism between bovicin HJ50 and BovK is still unknown. We performed saturated alanine scanning mutagenesis and other amino acid substitutions on bovicin HJ50 using a semi-in vitro biosynthesis. Results of the mutants inducing activities indicated that several charged and hydrophobic amino acids in ring B of bovicin HJ50, as well as two glycines were key residues to recognize BovK. Circular dichroism analyses indicated that both glycines contributed to bovicin HJ50 structural changes in the membrane. Biotin-labeled bovicin HJ50 could interact with the N-terminal sensor of BovK, and several charged residues and a conserved hydrophobic region in the N-terminal portion of BovK sensor domain were important for interacting with the signal bovicin HJ50. By combining the results, we suggested a mechanism of bovicin HJ50 recognizing and activating BovK mainly through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions.
TI  - Chemical composition and nutrient degradability in elephant grass silage inoculated with Streptococcus bovis isolated from the rumen.
AB  - The objective of the present study was to assess the chemical and bromatological  composition and in situ degradability of elephant grass silages inoculated with Streptococcus bovis isolated from cattle rumen. A complete randomized design was used with four treatments and six replications: elephant grass silage, elephant grass silage inoculated with 10(6) CFU/g Streptococcus bovis JB1 strains; elephant grass silage inoculated with 106 CFU/g Streptococcus bovis HC5 strains; elephant grass silage inoculated with 106 CFU/g Enterococcus faecium with six replications each. The pH and ammoniacal nitrogen values were lower (P<0.05) for the silages inoculated with Streptococcus bovis JB1 and HC5, respectively. The silage inoculated with Streptococcus bovis had a higher crude protein content (P<0.05) and there were no differences for the fiber contents in the silage. The (a)soluble fraction degradability, especially in the silages inoculated with Streptococcus bovis JB1 and HC5, had higher values, 30.77 and 29.97%, for dry matter and 31.01 and 36.66% for crude protein, respectively. Inoculation with Streptococcus bovis improved the fermentation profile, protein value and rumen degradability of the nutrients.
TI  - Trends in diagnosis and control of bovine mastitis: a review.
AB  - Mastitis (inflammation of mammary gland) is a most devastating disease condition  in terms of economic losses occurring throughout the world. The etiological agents may vary from place to place depending on climate; animal species and animal husbandry and include wide variety of gram positive and gram negative bacteria; and fungi. They may be either contagious viz. Staphylococcus aureus; Streptococcus agalactiae or environmental viz. S. dysgalactiae, S. uberis, Corynebacterium bovis and Coagulase negative Staphylococcus. Conventional diagnostic tests viz. California Mastitis Test (CMT); R-mastitest and Mast-O-test methods are applied under field conditions; whereas somatic cell count and Bulk Tank Somatic Cell Count (BTSCC) are useful for early mastitis detection and detection of sub clinical or chronic mastitis respectively. In vitro culture based diagnosis require further study as they can detect only viable cells. The advent of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology along with its various versions like multiplex and real time PCR has improved the rapidity and sensitivity of diagnosis. Circulating micro RNA (miRNA) based diagnosis; immune assay and proteomics based detection along with biochips and biosensors prove to be asset to diagnosticians for advanced diagnosis of this economically important condition. Improvement of milking hygiene; implementation of post-milking teat disinfection; regular control of the milking equipments; implementation of milking order; Improvement of bedding material are the general measures to prevent new cases of mastitis. The use of antibiotics (intramammary infusions; bacteriocins) and herbs (Terminalia spp.) are important for prophylaxis and therapeutics. Vaccines viz. cell based; Recombinant (staphylococcal enterotoxin type C mutant) or chimeric (pauA); live (S. uberis 0140J stain based) and bacterial surface extract based; DNA-based and DNA-protein based have greatly aided in management of bovine mastitis. Quorum sensing and disease resistant breeding using novel biomarkers viz. toll like receptors (TLR) 2 and 4, interleukin (IL) 8; breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) and calcium channel voltage-dependent alpha 2/delta sub unit 1 (CACNA2D1) are also indispensable. This mini review gives an overview of all these different aspects that act as trend setters as far as the diagnosis and control of bovine mastitis is concerned to help the diagnosticians; epidemiologists and researchers not to remain ignorant about this grave condition.
TI  - Activity of oritavancin tested against uncommonly isolated Gram-positive pathogens responsible for documented infections in hospitals worldwide.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the oritavancin spectrum and activity against 2811 rarer species of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), streptococci and other Gram-positive species. METHODS: A total of 2057 CoNS (14 species), 674 streptococci (7 groups) and 80 other Gram-positive species (3 genera) collected over a 5 year period as part of the SENTRY Program (2008-12) were included. Isolates were primarily identified by the participating laboratory and identification was confirmed by the reference monitoring laboratory (JMI Laboratories, North Liberty, IA, USA). Isolates were tested for susceptibility by broth microdilution following the CLSI M07-A9 and M100-S23 documents. RESULTS: Overall, oritavancin was active against all CoNS (MIC50/MIC90, 0.015/0.06 mg/L), with MIC50 values of </=0.008-0.03 mg/L. Streptococci exhibited oritavancin MIC50 results of </=0.008 mg/L, except for the Streptococcus bovis (0.03 mg/L), Streptococcus dysgalactiae (0.06 mg/L) and Streptococcus salivarius/vestibularis (0.06 mg/L) groups. Micrococcus spp., Listeria monocytogenes and Corynebacterium spp. had oritavancin MIC50 results of </=0.008 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: This study expands the oritavancin in vitro data against several species of Gram-positive organisms.
TI  - Cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies using quantitative real-time PCR and  bacterial culture to identify contagious mastitis cases in large dairy herds.
AB  - Diagnostic strategies to detect contagious mastitis caused by Mycoplasma bovis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae in dairy herds during an outbreak have been minimally studied with regard to cost and diagnostic sensitivity. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies for identification of infected cows in two California dairy herds during contagious mastitis outbreaks. M. bovis was investigated in a subset of a herd (n=1210 cows) with an estimated prevalence of 2.8% (95% CI=1.9, 3.7), whereas Staph. aureus and Strep. agalactiae were studied in a second herd (n=351 cows) with an estimated prevalence of 3.4% (95% CI=1.5, 5.3) and 16.8% (95% CI=12.9, 20.7), respectively. Diagnostic strategies involved a combination of testing stages that utilized bacterial culture, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), or both. Strategies were applied to individual or pooled samples of 5, 10, 50 or 100 samples. Culture was considered the gold standard for sensitivity estimation of each strategy. The reference strategy was the strategy with the lowest cost per culture-positive cow which for both M. bovis and Strep. agalactiae consisted of 2 stages, culture of samples in pools of 5 followed by culture of individual samples in positive pools with a sensitivity of 73.5% (95% CI: 55.6, 87.1) and 96.6% (95% CI: 27.7, 84.8), respectively. The reference strategy for Staph. aureus consisted of 3 stages, culture of individual samples in pools of 100 (stage 1), culture constituents of those positive from stage 1 in pools of 5 (stage 2), culture constituents of those positive from stage 2 individually (stage 3) which resulted in a sensitivity of 58.3% (95% CI: 88.3, 99.6). The most cost-effective alternative to the reference strategy was whole herd milk culture for all 3 pathogens. QPCR testing was a component of the second most cost-effective alternative for M. bovis and the third most cost-effective alternatives for the 3 pathogens. A stochastic model was used to assess the effect of prevalence or herd size on the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies. In the current study, increasing the prevalence of mastitis did not alter the ranking of strategies by cost-effectiveness. However, larger herds could benefit from testing larger pools such as 50 or 100 samples to improve cost-effectiveness. Several diagnostic strategy options exist to identify contagious mastitis in herds, decisions should be based on cost and sensitivity of the strategies available.
TI  - Fulminant neonatal sepsis due to Streptococcus alactolyticus - A case report and  review.
AB  - Group D streptococci have rarely been associated with neonatal infections. We report a case of fulminant respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) caused by Streptococcus alactolyticus in a term neonate. Gram staining revealed gram-positive cocci and culture grew group D streptococci in samples taken from trachea, ear, and nasopharynx. Streptococcus alactolyticus was identified using automated microbial identification system (Vitek 2). Histopathology showed massive pulmonary inflammation with intra-alveolar granulocytosis and secondary pulmonary bleeding as etiology of fatal outcome. To our knowledge, this is first case presenting neonatal infection caused by Streptococcus alactolyticus.
TI  - Pathogen-specific effects on milk yield in repeated clinical mastitis episodes in Holstein dairy cows.
AB  - The objective of this study was to estimate the effects of clinical mastitis (CM) cases due to different pathogens on milk yield in Holstein cows. The first 3 CM cases in a cow's lactation were modeled. Eight categories of pathogens were included: Streptococcus spp.; Staphylococcus aureus; coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS); Escherichia coli; Klebsiella spp.; cases with CM signs but no bacterial growth (above the level detectable by our microbiological procedures) observed in the culture sample, and cases with contamination (>/= 3 pathogens in the sample); other pathogens that may be treated with antibiotics (included Citrobacter, Corynebacterium bovis, Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Pasteurella, Pseudomonas; "other treatable"); and other pathogens not successfully treated with antibiotics (Trueperella pyogenes, Mycoplasma, Prototheca, yeasts; "other not treatable"). Data from 38,276 lactations in cows from 5 New York State dairy herds, collected from 2003-2004 until 2011, were analyzed. Mixed models with an autoregressive correlation structure (to account for correlation among the repeated measures of milk yield within a lactation) were estimated. Primiparous (lactation 1) and multiparous (lactations 2 and 3) cows were analyzed separately, as the shapes of their lactation curves differed. Primiparas were followed for up to 48 wk of lactation and multiparas for up to 44 wk. Fixed effects included parity, calving season, week of lactation, CM (type, case number, and timing of CM in relation to milk production cycle), and other diseases (milk fever, retained placenta, metritis, ketosis, displaced abomasum). Herd was modeled as a random effect. Clinical mastitis was more common in multiparas than in primiparas. In primiparas, Streptococcus spp. occurred most frequently as the first case. In multiparas, E. coli was most common as the first case. In subsequent cases, CM cases with no specific growth or contamination were most common in both parity groups. The hazard of CM increased with case number. Mastitic cows were generally higher producers before the CM episode than their nonmastitic herdmates. Milk loss varied with pathogen and case number. In primiparas, the greatest losses were associated with E. coli and "other not treatable" organisms. In multiparas, the greatest losses were associated with Klebsiella spp. and "other not treatable" organisms. Milk loss was not associated with occurrence of CNS. The findings may help farmers to make optimal management decisions for their cows.
TI  - Combined computed tomography and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography  in the diagnosis of prosthetic valve endocarditis: a case series.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of prosthetic valve endocarditis is challenging. The gold standard for prosthetic valve endocarditis diagnosis is trans-esophageal echocardiography. However, trans-esophageal echocardiography may result in negative findings or yield images difficult to differentiate from thrombus in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis. Combined computed tomography and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography is a potentially promising diagnostic tool for several infectious conditions and it has also been employed in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis but data are still scant. CASE PRESENTATIONS: We reviewed the charts of 6 patients with prosthetic aortic valves evaluated for suspicion of prosthetic valve endocarditis, at two different hospital, over a 3-year period. We found 3 patients with early-onset PVE cases and blood cultures yielding Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus lugdunensis, respectively; and 3 late-onset cases in the remaining 3 patients with isolation in the blood of Streptococcus bovis, Candida albicans and P. aeruginosa, respectively. Initial trans-esophageal echocardiography was negative in all the patients, while fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed images suspicious for prosthetic valve endocarditis. In 4 out of 6 patients valve replacement was done with histology confirming the prosthetic valve endocarditis diagnosis. After an adequate course of antibiotic therapy fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed resolution of prosthetic valve endocarditis in all the patients. CONCLUSION: Our experience confirms the potential role of fluoroseoxyglucose positron emission tomography in the diagnosis and follow-up of prosthetic valve endocarditis.
TI  - [Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus isolated from cerebrospinal fluid in a pediatric patient].
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus is known to cause bacterial meningitis in adults, and most of the few pediatric cases observed occurred in neonates. We report the case of a 9-month old boy with a history of repeated hospitalizations due to respiratory diseases, who presented meningitis and bacteremia by Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasterianus. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case in Santa Fe to this date.

TI  - The effects of active dried and killed dried yeast on subacute ruminal acidosis,  ruminal fermentation, and nutrient digestibility in beef heifers.
AB  - The study addressed the importance of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) viability  for reducing the incidence of subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) and improving total tract nutrient digestibility in beef heifers. Six ruminally cannulated beef heifers (680 +/- 50 kg BW) were used in a replicated 3 x 3 Latin square design and were fed a diet consisting of 40% barley silage, 10% chopped grass hay, and 50% barley grain-based concentrate (DM basis). Treatments were 1) no yeast (Control), 2) active dried yeast (ADY; 4 g providing 10(10) cfu/g; AB Vista, Marlborough, UK), and 3) killed dried yeast (KDY; 4 g autoclaved ADY). The treatments were directly dosed via the ruminal cannula daily at the time of feeding. The periods consisted of 2 wk of adaptation (d 1 to 14) and 7 d of measurements (d 15 to 21). Ruminal pH was continuously measured (d 15 to 21) using an indwelling system. Ruminal contents were sampled on d 15 and 17 at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 h after feeding. Total tract nutrient digestibility was measured using an external marker (YbCl3) from d 15 to 19. No treatment difference was observed for DMI (P = 0.86). Yeast supplementation (ADY and KDY) tended to increase total tract digestibility of starch (P = 0.07) whereas no effects were observed on digestibility of other nutrients. Both ADY and KDY elevated minimum (P < 0.01) and mean ruminal pH (P = 0.02) whereas no effects were observed on maximum pH (P = 0.12). Irrespective of its viability, yeast supplementation was effective in reducing time that ruminal pH was below 5.8 (P < 0.01) and 5.6 (P < 0.01). No treatment differences were observed for the ruminal VFA profile and lactate concentration. No treatment differences were observed on the relative population size of Streptococcus bovis, Fibrobacter succinogenes, and Megasphaera elsdenii (P > 0.10); however, the proportion of Ruminococcus flavefaciens in solid fraction of digesta was greater with KDY (P = 0.05). The study demonstrates the positive effects of yeast, irrespective of its viability, in reducing the severity of SARA. However, further studies are required to evaluate the importance of yeast viability for other dietary conditions, particularly when the risk of acidosis is high.

TI  - Characterization of the core rumen microbiome in cattle during transition from forage to concentrate as well as during and after an acidotic challenge.
AB  - This study investigated the effect of diet and host on the rumen bacterial microbiome and the impact of an acidotic challenge on its composition. Using parallel pyrosequencing of the V3 hypervariable region of 16S rRNA gene, solid and liquid associated bacterial communities of 8 heifers were profiled. Heifers were exclusively fed forage, before being transitioned to a concentrate diet, subjected to an acidotic challenge and allowed to recover. Samples of rumen digesta were collected when heifers were fed forage, mixed forage, high grain, during challenge (4 h and 12 h) and recovery. A total of 560,994 high-quality bacterial sequences were obtained from the solid and liquid digesta. Using cluster analysis, prominent bacterial populations differed (P</=0.10) in solid and liquid fractions between forage and grain diets. Differences among hosts and diets were not revealed by DGGE, but real time qPCR showed that several bacteria taxon were impacted by changes in diet, with the exception of Streptococcus bovis. Analysis of the core rumen microbiome identified 32 OTU's representing 10 distinct bacterial taxa including Bacteroidetes (32.8%), Firmicutes (43.2%) and Proteobacteria (14.3%). Diversity of OTUs was highest with forage with 38 unique OTUs identified as compared to only 11 with the high grain diet. Comparison of the microbial profiles of clincial vs. subclinical acidotic heifers found a increases in the relative abundances of Acetitomaculum, Lactobacillus, Prevotella, and Streptococcus. Increases in Streptococcus and Lactobacillus likely reflect the tolerance of these species to low pH and their ability to proliferate on surplus fermentable carbohydrate. The acetogen, Acetitomaculum may thereforeplay a role in the conversion of lactate to acetate in acidotic animals. Further profiling of the bacterial populations associated with subclinical and clinical acidosis could establish a microbial fingerprint for these disorders and provide insight into whether there are causative microbial populations that could potentially be therapeutically manipulated.
TI  - Novel real-time PCR assays using TaqMan minor groove binder probes for identification of fecal carriage of Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex from rectal swab specimens.
AB  - Real-time PCR based on the recN and gyrB genes was developed to detect four Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex (SBEC) subspecies from rectal swab specimens. The overall prevalence was 35.2%: Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (11.1%), S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (13%), Streptococcus infantarius subsp. coli (20.4%), and S. infantarius subsp. infantarius (11.1%). To conclude, these real-time PCR assays provide a reliable molecular method to detect SBEC pathogenic subspecies from rectal swab specimens.
TI  - Comparative genomics analysis of Streptococcus isolates from the human small intestine reveals their adaptation to a highly dynamic ecosystem.
AB  - The human small-intestinal microbiota is characterised by relatively large and dynamic Streptococcus populations. In this study, genome sequences of small-intestinal streptococci from S. mitis, S. bovis, and S. salivarius species-groups were determined and compared with those from 58 Streptococcus strains in public databases. The Streptococcus pangenome consists of 12,403 orthologous groups of which 574 are shared among all sequenced streptococci and are defined as the Streptococcus core genome. Genome mining of the small-intestinal streptococci focused on functions playing an important role in the interaction of these streptococci in the small-intestinal ecosystem, including natural competence and nutrient-transport and metabolism. Analysis of the small-intestinal Streptococcus genomes predicts a high capacity to synthesize amino acids and various vitamins as well as substantial divergence in their carbohydrate transport and metabolic capacities, which is in agreement with observed physiological differences between these Streptococcus strains. Gene-specific PCR-strategies enabled evaluation of conservation of Streptococcus populations in intestinal samples from different human individuals, revealing that the S. salivarius strains were frequently detected in the small-intestine microbiota, supporting the representative value of the genomes provided in this study. Finally, the Streptococcus genomes allow prediction of the effect of dietary substances on Streptococcus population dynamics in the human small-intestine.
TI  - [New insight into bacterial zoonotic pathogens posing health hazards to humans].
AB  - This article presents the problem of evolutionary changes of zoonotic pathogens responsible for human diseases. Everyone is exposed to the risk of zoonotic infection, particularly employees having direct contact with animals, i.e. veterinarians, breeders, butchers and workers of animal products' processing industry. The article focuses on pathogens monitored by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), which has been collecting statistical data on zoonoses from all European Union countries for 19 years and publishing collected data in annual epidemiological reports. Currently, the most important 11 pathogens responsible for causing human zoonotic diseases are being monitored, of which seven are bacteria: Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium bovis, Brucella spp., Coxiella burnetti and Verotoxin-producing E. coli (VTEC)/Shiga-like toxin producing E. coli (STEC). As particularly important are considered foodborne pathogens. The article also includes new emerging zoonotic bacteria, which are not currently monitored by ECDC but might pose a serious epidemiological problem in a foreseeable future: Streptococcus iniae, S. suis, S. dysgalactiae and staphylococci: Staphylococcus intermedius, S. pseudintermedius. Those species have just crossed the animal-human interspecies barrier. The exact mechanism of this phenomenon remains unknown, it is connected, however, with genetic variability, capability to survive in changing environment. These abilities derive from DNA rearrangement and horizontal gene transfer between bacterial cells. Substantial increase in the number of scientific publications on this subject, observed over the last few years, illustrates the importance of the problem.
TI  - Direct production of organic acids from starch by cell surface-engineered Corynebacterium glutamicum in anaerobic conditions.
AB  - We produced organic acids, including lactate and succinate, directly from soluble starch under anaerobic conditions using high cell-density cultures of Corynebacterium glutamicum displaying alpha-amylase (AmyA) from Streptococcus bovis 148 on the cell surface. Notably, reactions performed under anaerobic conditions at 35 and 40 degrees C, which are higher than the optimal growth temperature of 30 degrees C, showed 32% and 19%, respectively, higher productivity of the organic acids lactate, succinate, and acetate compared to that at 30 degrees C. However, alpha-amylase was not stably anchored and released into the medium from the cell surface during reactions at these higher temperatures, as demonstrated by the 61% and 85% decreases in activity, respectively, from baseline, compared to the only 8% decrease at 30 degrees C. The AmyA-displaying C. glutamicum cells retained their starch-degrading capacity during five 10 h reaction cycles at 30 degrees C, producing 107.8 g/l of total organic acids, including 88.9 g/l lactate and 14.0 g/l succinate. The applicability of cell surface-engineering technology for the production of organic acids from biomass by high cell-density cultures of C. glutamicum under anaerobic conditions was demonstrated.
TI  - L-lactate production from seaweed hydrolysate of Laminaria japonica using metabolically engineered Escherichia coli.
AB  - Renewable and carbon neutral, marine algal biomass could be an attractive alternative substrate for the production of biofuel and various biorefinery products. Thus, the feasibility of brown seaweed (Laminaria japonica) hydrolysate as a carbon source was investigated here for L-lactate production. This work reports the homofermentative route for L-lactate production by introducing Streptococcus bovis/equinus L-lactate dehydrogenase in an engineered Escherichia coli strain where synthesis of the competing by-product was blocked. The engineered strain utilized both glucose and mannitol present in the hydrolysate under microaerobic condition and produced 37.7 g/L of high optical purity L-lactate at 80 % of the maximum theoretical value. The result shown in this study implies that algal biomass would be as competitive with lignocellulosic biomass in terms of lactic acid production and that brown seaweed can be used as a feedstock for the industrial production of other chemicals.
TI  - [Progress of research in the relationship between microorganisms and colorectal cancer].
AB  - Colorectal cancer is a common carcinoma of gastrointestinal tract, and its incidence is associated with genetic mutations, environment as well as inflammation. Recent studies have shown that many microorganisms may have played an important role in pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. The common bacteria involved in colorectal cancer are Streptococcus bovis, Helicobacter pylori, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides, and Fusobacterium, etc. The common viruses are Polyomavirus, Epstein Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus and Human papillomavirus, etc. The detailed mechanism of these microorganisms in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer is unclear, and there are no reports on specific pathogenic microorganisms which cause the disease directly. The direction of future researches will focus on metagenome, metatranscriptome, and metaproteome of microorganisms associated with the incidence of colorectal cancer.

AB  - As mirrored by several topics throughout history, the causal link between infectious diseases and cancer was initially viewed with disbelief and subsequently forgotten, only to be rediscovered decades later, when it started flourishing into a vibrant multidisciplinary field . Just a few years ago, it was estimated that over 20% of all cancers are causally linked to infectious diseases, most frequently caused by bacteria, viruses, and parasites .
TI  - Viridans and bovis group streptococci that cause infective endocarditis in two regions with contrasting epidemiology.
AB  - Viridans group (VGS) or bovis group streptococci (BGS) are the major causes for streptococcal infective endocarditis (IE). However, the causative isolates are not sufficiently characterized. Using multilocus sequence analysis we have examined VGS and BGS (VGS/BGS) isolates that caused IE in southern India and Germany, two distant geographic regions with a contrasting IE epidemiology. Other than in Germany, the majority of patients (68%) in Chennai, southern India had an underlying rheumatic heart disease (RHD). In accord with the high prevalence of RHD in the younger population and with the expansive age structure of India, the median age (24 years) of the VGS/BGS endocarditis patients was lower than in Germany (63 years), where RHD is rare and the age structure is contractive. Both in Germany and in southern India, the majority of cases were caused by mitis group streptococci, however, with considerable differences in the spectra of causative (sub)species. BGS endocarditis was more frequent in Germany. The spectrum of VGS/BGS that cause IE differs considerably between distant geographic regions in which different predisposing conditions prevail. Therefore, improved microbiological diagnosis in IE may facilitate determination of the optimal therapy.
TI  - A giant pseudoaneurysm of the forearm as unusual complication of bacterial endocarditis.
AB  - A 59-year-old man with fever was diagnosed with endocarditis due to Streptococcus bovis. Two weeks after antibiotic therapy was started, he presented with red and painful swelling of the forearm without any sign of systemic inflammation. A giant hematoma connected to the radial artery was detected with ultrasound. Surgical intervention with the removal of multiple, sterile clots from the hematoma was performed, and the multiple lacerations of the artery detected were corrected. This is the first case reporting rupture of the radial artery as a complication of infective endocarditis.
TI  - A case-control study: are urological procedures risk factors for the development  of infective endocarditis?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between urological procedures and the development of infective endocarditis (IE), as there are case-reports linking urological procedures to IE but evidence of a causal relationship is lacking and no major guidelines advise prophylaxis to prevent development of IE during transurethral urological procedures. No case-control study has been undertaken to examine the relationship between urological procedures and the development of IE. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of the IE database at our institution. The population consisted of patients diagnosed with enterococcal, staphylococcal, Streptococcus bovis-group and oral streptococcal IE over a 10-year period. Possible risk factors for the development of IE, including urological procedures were collected. A case-control design was used and univariable and multivariable analyses were carried out. Missing data was accounted for using the multiple imputations method. RESULTS: We included 384 patients with IE. There was a statistical association between the development of enterococcal IE and preceding urological procedures (odds ratio 8.21, 95% confidence interval 3.54-19.05, P < 0.05). Increasing age and being an intravenous drug user were also associated with enterococcal IE. Haemodialysis and the presence of an intracardiac device were associated with the development of coagulase-negative staphyloccal IE. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to show a statistical association between urological procedures and the development of IE. The bacteraemia leading to IE may be a result of the urological procedures or a consequence of the underlying urological pathology causing recurrent subclinical bacteraemias.
TI  - Construction of isogenic mutants in Streptococcus gallolyticus based on the development of new mobilizable vectors.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus is an emerging cause of infective endocarditis that has been epidemiologically linked to colorectal cancer. S. gallolyticus is poorly transformable using electroporation and no defined mutant has been published yet. Hence, we used mobilization to introduce plasmid DNA from Streptococcus agalactiae into S. gallolyticus using the transfer origin of the conjugative element TnGBS1 (oriTTnGBS1), followed by a classical homologous recombination technique. Two isogenic mutants of S. gallolyticus UCN34, one deleted for the pil1 pilus operon and another for the sortase A gene, were constructed and characterized. This genetic tool should help in unravelling virulence mechanisms of this bacterium.
TI  - Prevalence and comparison of Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius and Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus in raw and fermented dairy products from East and West Africa.
AB  - Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius (Sii) and Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus are members of the Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex (SBSEC) associated with human infections. SBSEC-related endocarditis was furthermore associated with rural residency in Southern Europe. SBSEC members are increasingly isolated as predominant species from fermented dairy products in Europe, Asia and Africa. African variants of Sii displayed dairy adaptations to lactose metabolism paralleling those of Streptococcus thermophilus including genome decay. In this study, the aim was to assess the prevalence of Sii and possibly other SBSEC members in dairy products of East and West Africa in order to identify their habitat, estimate their importance in dairy fermentation processes and determine geographic areas affected by this potential health risk. Presumptive SBSEC members were isolated on semi-selective M17 and SM agar media. Subsequent genotypic identification of isolates was based on rep-PCR fingerprinting and SBSEC-specific16S rRNA gene PCR assay. Detailed identification was achieved through application of novel primers enhancing the binding stringency in partial groES/groEL gene amplification and subsequent DNA sequencing. The presence of S. thermophilus-like lacS and lacZ genes in the SBSEC isolates was determined to elucidate the prevalence of this dairy adaptation. Isolates (n = 754) were obtained from 72 raw and 95 fermented milk samples from Cote d'Ivoire and Kenya on semi-selective agar media. Colonies of Sii were not detected from raw milk despite high microbial titers of approximately 10(6)CFU/mL on M17 agar medium. However, after spontaneous milk fermentation Sii was genotypically identified in 94.1% of Kenyan samples and 60.8% of Kenyan isolates. Sii prevalence in Cote d'Ivoire displayed seasonal variations in samples from 32.3% (June) to 40.0% (Dec/Jan) and isolates from 20.5% (June) to 27.7% (Dec/Jan) present at titers of 10(6)-10(8)CFU/mL. lacS and lacZ genes were detected in all Kenyan and 25.8% (June) to 65.4% (Dec/Jan) of Ivorian Sii isolates. Regional differences in prevalence of Sii and dairy adaptations were observed, but no clear effect of dairy animal, fermentation procedure and climate was revealed. Conclusively, the high prevalence of Sii in Kenya, Cote d'Ivoire in addition to Somalia, Sudan and Mali strongly indicates a pivotal role of Sii in traditional African dairy fermentations potentially paralleling that of typical western dairy species S. thermophilus. Putative health risks associated with the consumption of high amounts of live Sii and potential different degrees of evolutionary adaptation or ecological colonization require further epidemiologic and genomic investigations, particularly in Africa.
TI  - A new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - An in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant Hypericum olympicum L. cf. uniflorum. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae; group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes); and Clostridium difficile. MICs were 2-8 mg/L for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/L for S. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/L for all species in the presence of blood. Compound 1 was also tested against Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium but was inactive. The MIC for Mycobacterium bovis BCG was 60 mg/L, and compound 1 inhibited the ATP-dependent Mycobacterium tuberculosis MurE ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) = 75 muM]. In a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of S. aureus overexpressing the NorA multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)C-enoxacin in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. Only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with IC50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 muM against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.
TI  - Daptomycin activity against uncommonly isolated streptococcal and other gram-positive species groups.
AB  - A total of 1,356 clinical isolates were tested against daptomycin by broth microdilution methods. Daptomycin was active against seven groups of viridans group streptococci (MIC50 and MIC90 values ranging from </=0.06 and </=0.06 mug/ml [Streptococcus bovis and Streptococcus dysgalactiae] to 0.5 and 1 mug/ml [Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus parasanguinis], respectively), beta-hemolytic streptococci serogroups C, F, and G (MIC50 and MIC90, </=0.06 to 0.25 and 0.12 to 0.25 mug/ml, respectively), Corynebacterium spp. (MIC50 and MIC90, </=0.06 and 0.12 mug/ml, respectively), and Micrococcus spp. (MIC50 and MIC90, </=0.06 and 0.25 mug/ml, respectively). Listeria monocytogenes exhibited higher daptomycin MICs (MIC50 and MIC90, 2 and 4 mug/ml, respectively) than other tested organisms.
TI  - Use of real-time PCR technique in determination of major fibrolytic and non fibrolytic bacteria present in Indian Surti buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis).
AB  - In the milk industry in India, buffalo breeds are most commonly used for milk production. Efficiency of fiber digestion in ruminants is critical for animal productivity. Bacteria play an important role in fiber digestion and utilization. Absolute quantification real-time PCR was used to quantify ten bacterial species in rumen fluid of Surti buffalo fed green fodder, dry roughage and compound concentrate mixture. Abundance of each target taxon was calculated as a fraction of the total 16S rRNA gene copies in the samples, using taxon-specific primers. Bacterial populations showed a clear predominance of Ruminococcus albus, which comprised 5.66% of the bacterial rRNA gene copies in the samples. However, only 0.9% to 4.24% of the bacterial rRNA gene copies were represented by the ruminal Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Prevotella species. The proportion of rRNA gene copies attributable to Selenomonas ruminantium, Streptococcus bovis, Ruminobacter amylophilus, Treponema bryantii and Anaerovibrio lipolytica was even less abundant, each comprising < 0.11% of the bacterial rRNA gene copies. The data suggest that the aggregate abundance of the most intensively studied ruminal bacterial species is relatively low and that a large fraction of the uncultured population represents a single bacterial genus.
TI  - Evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  VersaTREK blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  - The Verigene Gram-positive blood culture (BC-GP) assay (Nanosphere, Northbrook, IL) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of Gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. A total of 148 VersaTREK REDOX 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating Gram-positive bacteria were tested. Results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) identifications. We obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (24), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (14), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) (17), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), Streptococcus salivarius (5), Streptococcus parasanguinis (2), Streptococcus sanguinis (1), Streptococcus cristatus (1), the Streptococcus bovis group (5), Streptococcus agalactiae (9), the Streptococcus anginosus group (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE FCM) (16), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (3), Aerococcus viridans (2), Bacillus (6), Corynebacterium (8), Lactobacillus (2), Micrococcus (2), Neisseria mucosa (1), Escherichia coli (3), Candida tropicalis (1), Propionibacterium (1), and Rothia (1). Overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. A total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. We tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. A chart review of 31 patients with MRSA, MSSA, or VRE demonstrated that the Nanosphere BC-GP assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. Additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with MRSA or VRE. The BC-GP assay may have a positive impact on patient care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis group and biliary tract infections: an analysis of 51 cases.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis is a well-known cause of endocarditis, but its role in other  infections has not been well described. We analysed prospectively all patients with biliary tract infections caused by S. bovis group during the period 1988-2011. We selected those cases associated with cholangitis and cholecystitis, defined according to Tokyo guidelines. Identification of the strains was performed using the API 20 Strep and the GP card of the Vitek 2 system, and was confirmed by molecular methods. Our series included 51 cases (30 cholangitis and 21 cholecystitis). The associated microorganisms were: Streptococcus infantarius (biotype II/1) 29 cases (57%), Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (biotype II/2) 20 cases (39%) and Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (biotype I) two cases (4%). The only difference found between S. infantarius and S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus was a greater association of the first with malignant strictures of the bile ducts: 48% (14/29) versus 5% (1/20), p <0.001. Thirty-seven of the cases also had bacteraemia, causing 20% (37/185) of all S. bovis bacteraemia, with differences between S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (2/112; 2%) and the other two microorganisms: S. infantarius and S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (35/73; 48%; p <0.001). The vast majority of biliary tract infections due to S. bovis group are caused by S. infantarius and S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (S. bovis biotype II), and nearly half of the bacteraemia due to these two species has a biliary source (43% of the S. infantarius and 56% of S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus).
TI  - Splenic abscess caused by Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus as presentation of a pancreatic cancer.
AB  - Splenic abscesses caused by Streptococcus bovis are rarely reported in the literature and are mainly seen in patients with endocarditis and associated colonic neoplasia/carcinoma. We report the first case of splenic abscess caused by Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (Streptococcus bovis biotype II/2) as presentation of a pancreatic cancer.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis bacteraemia: an evaluation of the long-term effect on cardiac outcomes.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Streptococcus bovis can lead to bacteraemia, septicaemia, and ultimately endocarditis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term implications of S. bovis endocarditis on cardiac morbidity and mortality. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed between January 2000 and March 2009 to assess all patients diagnosed with S. bovis bacteraemia from the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust. The primary end-point for cardiac investigations was the presence of endocarditis. Secondary end-points included referral for cardiac surgery and overall mortality. RESULTS: Sixty-one positive S. bovis blood cultures from 43 patients were included. Following echocardiography, seven patients were diagnosed with infective endocarditis (16.3 % of total patients); four patients (9.3 %) had native valve involvement while three (7.0 %) had prosthetic valve infection. Five of these seven patients had more than one positive S. bovis culture (71.4 %). Three had significant valve dysfunction that warranted surgical repair/replacement, one of whom was unfit for surgery. There was a 100 % recurrence rate amongst the valve replacement patients (n = 2) and six patients with endocarditis had colorectal pathology. Patients with endocarditis had similar long-term survival as those with non-endocarditic bacteraemia (57.1 % alive vs. 50 % of non-endocarditis patients, p = 0.73). CONCLUSION: Streptococcus bovis endocarditis patients tended to have pre-existing valvular heart disease and those with prosthetic heart valves had higher surgical intervention and relapse rates. These patients experienced a higher rate of co-existing colorectal pathology but currently have reasonable long-term outcomes. This may suggest that they represent a patient population that merits consideration for an early surgical strategy to maximise long-term results, however, further evaluation is warranted.
TI  - Is colonoscopy necessary in cases of infection by Streptococcus bovis biotype II?
AB  - The association of colorectal neoplasia (CRN) with Streptococcus bovis biotype I  (SBI) infection is well recognized. However, this is not the case for Streptococcus bovis biotype II (SBII). We conducted this study in order to analyze the relationship between SBII and CRN. We analyzed all cases of bacteremia due to SBI (n = 99) and SBII (n = 36) diagnosed in our hospital (during the period 1988-2011) that were followed up with colonoscopy. In addition, we reviewed the literature (during the period 1982-2011) to select all cases of infection of SB that had undergone colonoscopy or other adequate form of colorectal examination. A multivariate analysis was performed to detect CRN risk factors in patients infected with SB. From the 223 cases of SB infection included in the analysis (135 from our institution and 88 from the literature review), 159 were due to SBI and 64 were caused by SBII. As compared with SBI, the SBII cases had a lower frequency of CRN (27 % vs. 67 %, p <0.001), advanced adenomas (8 % vs. 29 %, p <0.01), and carcinomas (6 % vs. 21 %, p <0.01). In a multivariate analysis, and after adjusting for age, sex, type of infection, and biotype, SBII infection was not associated with CRN: odds ratio (OR) = 0.17; 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0.09 to 0.33. The only factor independently associated with CRN was SBI infection: OR = 5.7; 95 % CI = 3.0 to 10.9. The prevalence of CRN in patients infected with SBII is significantly lower than patients with SBI and does not appear to be higher than the CRN prevalence among the general population.
TI  - Systemic prepartum treatment of end-term dairy heifers with penethamate hydriodide: effect on udder health, milk yield, and culling until 120 days in milk.
AB  - Prepartum intramammary treatment with antimicrobials of end-term dairy heifers has frequently been proposed as a practice to reduce the prevalence of intramammary infections (IMI) at calving. From a safety standpoint for both animal and administrator, systemic treatment is preferred. A clinical trial was conducted on heifers from 10 well-managed, commercial dairy farms with a low prevalence of heifer mastitis. The aim was to assess both the short- and long-term effects of a systemic prepartum therapy with penethamate hydriodide on udder health and milk production. Because it was hypothesized that some herds would benefit more from this treatment than others, specific herd-level information was collected before the start of the actual trial to screen for and explain potential herd-specific treatment effects. Further, the effect of treatment on antimicrobial susceptibility of staphylococcal isolates was monitored. End-term heifers were either treated systemically (over 3 consecutive days) 2 wk before expected calving date with penethamate hydriodide (n=76) or remained untreated (n=73). Systemic prepartum treatment of end-term heifers with penethamate hydriodide resulted in fewer IMI in early lactation. However, all 6 cases of clinical mastitis in early lactation occurred in the treatment group [Streptococcus uberis (n=1), Corynebacterium bovis (n=1), Staphylococcus aureus (n=1); 1 sample was contaminated; 2 samples remained culture negative]. No long-term treatment effects (from 4 to 120 d in milk) on milk production, udder health, or culling hazard during later lactation were detected, although treated heifers belonging to herds classified as having low-yielding heifers out-produced the control heifers. Moreover, penicillin susceptibility of staphylococci isolated from milk samples of treated or control heifers did not differ. Herds with a low prevalence of heifer mastitis are not likely to benefit from prepartum systemic antimicrobial treatment of the end-term heifers.
TI  - Rapid mastitis detection assay on porous nitrocellulose membrane slides.
AB  - We have developed a rapid mastitis detection test based on the immobilization of  tag-specific antibody molecules, the binding of double-tagged amplicons, and as a secondary signal a conjugate of black carbon nanoparticles having molecules of a fusion protein of neutrAvidin and alkaline phosphatase at their surface. The antibodies were inkjet printed onto three different nitrocellulose membrane slides, Unisart (Sartorius), FAST (GE Whatman), and Oncyte-Avid (Grace-Biolabs), and the final assay signals on these slides were compared. The blackness of the spots was determined by flatbed scanning and assessment of the pixel gray volume using TotalLab image analysis software. The black spots could be easily read by the naked eye. We successfully demonstrated the detection of specific amplicons from mastitis-causing pathogens in less than 3 h. Using a similar protocol, we also showed that it was possible to detect specific amplicons from four different mastitis-causing pathogens (six strains) on the same pad. The influence of two different printing buffers, phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and carbonate buffer (pH 9.6), on the functionality of the primary antibodies was also compared.
TI  - Correlation among Streptococcus bovis, endocarditis and septicemia in a patient with advanced colon cancer: a case report.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: One of the bacterial agents that has been found to be associated with colorectal cancer is Streptococcus bovis, with 13% of infective endocarditis cases caused by this pathogenic species. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 57-year-old Caucasian man with infiltrating and ulcerating metastatic adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon. The patient was receiving second-line chemotherapy treatment and, on the eighth day of the second cycle, he developed a grade IV pancytopenia. We diagnosed a severe sepsis with positive blood cultures for Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus with a secondary endocarditis. CONCLUSIONS: A recent study suggests that the majority of patients affected by colonic cancer have a Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus colonization that becomes apparent as an overt infection only when immunosystem disorders or cardiac valve lesions occur. This correlation is important for involving more specialists in a correct and early diagnosis of this rare, but potentially fatal, complication.
TI  - The itinerary of Streptococcus gallolyticus infection in patients with colonic malignant disease.
AB  - Bacteria constitute about 90% of all cells in the human body. The densest and most complex bacterial community is in the large intestine. This population is quite stable in healthy intestines, but intestinal disease distorts the ecological balance and induces dysbiosis. Results of studies have indicated that the epithelial and metabolic changes that occur with colorectal cancer provide a competitive advantage to a subset of intestinal bacteria. Strikingly, however, Streptococcus gallolyticus gallolyticus (previously known as Streptococcus bovis biotype I) is one of the very few opportunistic pathogens that has been clinically linked to colonic malignant diseases. In this Personal View we describe how S. gallolyticus gallolyticus exploits its unique range of virulence features to cause infections in patients with colorectal cancer. We postulate that distinct virulence factors on one hand enable this bacterium to establish a symptomatic infection in susceptible individuals, and on the other hand make its ability to do this dependent on pre-existing colonic abnormalities. We believe that our current reconstruction of this route of infection aids understanding of how S. gallolyticus gallolyticus infections can be best exploited for early detection of colorectal cancer.
TI  - Microbial quality of lakes around Dharwad City, Karnataka, India.
AB  - Water being an essential component of food chain of living beings is contaminated day-by-day in the increasing order due to public apathy and improper management of water sources like lakes, reservoirs and ponds. The microbiological studies of Kelageri, Nuggikeri, Navalur, Neerasagar and Salakinakoppa lakes located around Dharwad were carried out with respect to total plate count (TPC),Total Fungal count (TFC) and total Coliform. They are highly contaminated with bacterial species like fecal Coliforms, E. coli, Bacillus species, Actinomycetes, Monococcus sps, Streptococcus sps. and Fungal sps like Pencilium, Fusarium, Mucor , Rhizopus, Yeast cells. The results indicate that the lakes except Neerasagar lake were considered to be unfit for drinking purpose due to the excess of anthropogenic activities, inflow of water through widespread agricultural land and stream, where the dairy industry, poultry, brick manufacturing unit, animal husbandry are maintained. The extent of pollution of water depends upon the dense population of these microorganisms which vary in rainy, winter and summer seasons. The presence of Fecal Streptococcal species viz., S. fecalis, S. equinus, S. faecium, S. bovis, S. avium, indicate the fecal pollution with seasonal variations throughout the year.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of the microflora of nixtamalized corn masa.
AB  - Corn tortillas are a staple in the diet among the Mexican population, and are traditionally produced through a process known as nixtamalization. This traditional process involves steeping whole-kernel corn in an alkaline solution overnight and then grinding the corn into dough (masa), which is then baked. While the masa is held before baking, significant microbial change can occur which leads to fermentation and spoilage. The objective of this research was to characterize and identify the microflora of nixtamalized corn masa from six different commercial tortilla mills throughout Guadalajara, Mexico. The identification of samples was conducted using the microbial identification system (MIS), which analyzes cellular fatty acids via gas chromatography to identify bacterial species. Lactic acid bacteria and aerobic mesophiles were the predominant organisms, with both groups having counts ranging from 10(4) to 10(7)cfu/g across all mills. Coliform populations were observed at counts of 10(2) to 10(3)cfu/g, while yeast and mold counts were typically less than 10(1)cfu/g. Some mills showed no presence of coliforms or yeast or mold. Streptococcus bovis and Lactobacillus oris were isolated from all mills, and were the most prevalent organisms representing 43% and 17% of all lactic acid bacteria isolated, respectively. S. bovis was also isolated on the aerobic tryptic soy plates and was the most prevalent species representing 19% of the total organisms from these aerobic plates.
TI  - Dynamics of fecal microbial communities in children with diarrhea of unknown etiology and genomic analysis of associated Streptococcus lutetiensis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The sequences of the 16S rRNA genes extracted from fecal samples provide insights into the dynamics of fecal microflora. This potentially gives valuable etiological information for patients whose conditions have been ascribed to unknown pathogens, which cannot be accomplished using routine culture methods. We studied 33 children with diarrhea who were admitted to the Children's Hospital in Shanxi Province during 2006. RESULTS: Nineteen of 33 children with diarrhea could not be etiologically diagnosed by routine culture and polymerase chain reaction methods. Eleven of 19 children with diarrhea of unknown etiology had Streptococcus as the most dominant fecal bacterial genus at admission. Eight of nine children whom three consecutive fecal samples were collected had Streptococcus as the dominant fecal bacterial genus, including three in the Streptococcus bovis group and three Streptococcus sp., which was reduced during and after recovery. We isolated strains that were possibly from the S. bovis group from feces sampled at admission, which were then identified as Streptococcus lutetiensis from one child and Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus from two children. We sequenced the genome of S. lutetiensis and identified five antibiotic islands, two pathogenicity islands, and five unique genomic islands. The identified virulence genes included hemolytic toxin cylZ of Streptococcus agalactiae and sortase associated with colonization of pathogenic streptococci. CONCLUSIONS: We identified S. lutetiensis and S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus from children with diarrhea of unknown etiology, and found pathogenic islands and virulence genes in the genome of S. lutetiensis.
TI  - Meningitis associated with strongyloidiasis in an area endemic for strongyloidiasis and human T-lymphotropic virus-1: a single-center experience in Japan between 1990 and 2010.
AB  - Meningitis caused by enteric flora is a known complication of strongyloidiasis, and human T-lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1) predisposes individuals to severe strongyloidiasis. We reviewed the clinical features of bacterial meningitis associated with strongyloidiasis seen at a single center in subtropical Japan, in an area endemic for both strongyloidiasis and HTLV-1. We found 33 episodes in 21 patients between 1990 and 2010. The results were remarkable for the high incidence of meningitis due to Gram-positive cocci (27.3 %), especially Streptococcus bovis, and culture-negative cases (42.4 %). Given the high incidence of Gram-positive meningitis, a modified approach to corticosteroid use would be advisable in areas where strongyloidiasis is endemic, due to the potentially adverse consequences of glucocorticoid therapy.
TI  - Progress in the development of vaccines against rumen methanogens.
AB  - Vaccination against rumen methanogens offers a practical approach to reduce methane emissions in livestock, particularly ruminants grazing on pasture. Although successful vaccination strategies have been reported for reducing the activity of the rumen-dwelling organism Streptococcus bovis in sheep and S. bovis and Lactobacillus spp. in cattle, earlier approaches using vaccines based on whole methanogen cells to reduce methane production in sheep have produced less promising results. An anti-methanogen vaccine will need to have broad specificity against methanogens commonly found in the rumen and induce antibody in saliva resulting in delivery of sufficiently high levels of antibodies to the rumen to reduce methanogen activity. Our approach has focussed on identifying surface and membrane-associated proteins that are conserved across a range of rumen methanogens. The identification of potential vaccine antigens has been assisted by recent advances in the knowledge of rumen methanogen genomes. Methanogen surface proteins have been shown to be immunogenic in ruminants and vaccination of sheep with these proteins induced specific antibody responses in saliva and rumen contents. Current studies are directed towards identifying key candidate antigens and investigating the level and types of salivary antibodies produced in sheep and cattle vaccinated with methanogen proteins, stability of antibodies in the rumen and their impact on rumen microbial populations. In addition, there is a need to identify adjuvants that stimulate high levels of salivary antibody and are suitable for formulating with protein antigens to produce a low-cost and effective vaccine.
TI  - Late Streptococcus bovis infection of total knee replacement complicated by infective endocarditis and associated with colonic ulcers.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis is rare cause of late infections after total knee replacement (TKR). This report presents a case of confirmed late septic arthritis following TKR caused by S bovis that was further complicated with infective endocarditis resulting in aortic valve insufficiency in an immunecompetent patient. As an association between S bovis and gastrointestinal malignancies is suggested, a workup for such malignancies was performed that revealed non-malignant ulcers in patient's ascending colon. The patient is currently recovering from his aortic valve replacement surgery and is scheduled to have annual colonoscopies. His knee joint has improved; however, he developed constant pain because of underlying chronic infection in the affected joint and has difficulties mobilising. Therefore, a revision TKR is considered but postponed until he fully recovers from his heart valve surgery.
TI  - Fermentation of alfalfa wet-fractionation liquids to volatile fatty acids by Streptococcus bovis and Megasphaera elsdenii.
AB  - "Green juice", obtained by squeezing fresh alfalfa leaves inoculated with lactic  acid bacteria, was fermented at room temperature for 7-21 d to obtain 12-47 g lactic acid L(-1). Inoculation of green juice with Streptococcus bovis and incubation at 39 degrees C reduced fermentation time to 8-12h. The resulting "brown juice" from either fermentation had a pH of approximately 4.5 and a protein precipitate. Upon adjustment to pH 5.2-6.8 and inoculation with Megasphaera elsdenii, brown juice was fermented within 48 h to up to 18 g of mixed volatile fatty acids (VFA) L(-1). Single-stage fermentation of green juice by both species in coculture typically resulted in overgrowth of S. bovis and acid inhibition of M. elsdenii, inhibiting VFA production. Because the juice fermentations are conducted without sterilization or supplemental nutrients, they can potentially contribute to an integrated process featuring protein recovery and fermentation of fractionated solids to VFA and other products.
TI  - Short communication: Comparison of pH, volatile fatty acids, and microbiome of rumen samples from preweaned calves obtained via cannula or stomach tube.
AB  - The objective of this study was to compare rumen samples from young dairy calves  obtained via a stomach tube (ST) or a ruminal cannula (RC). Five male Holstein calves (46+/-4.0 kg of body weight and 11+/-4.9 d of age) were ruminally cannulated at 15 d of age. Calves received 4 L/d of a commercial milk replacer (25% crude protein and 19.2% fat) at 12.5% dry matter, and were provided concentrate and chopped oats hay ad libitum throughout the study (56 d). In total, 29 paired rumen samples were obtained weekly throughout the study in most of the calves by each extraction method. These samples were used to determine pH and volatile fatty acids (VFA) concentration, and to quantify Prevotella ruminicola and Streptococcus bovis by quantitative PCR. Furthermore, a denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was performed on rumen samples harvested during wk 8 of the study to determine the degree of similarity between rumen bacteria communities. Rumen pH was 0.30 units greater in ST compared with RC samples. Furthermore, total VFA concentrations were greater in RC than in ST samples. However, when analyzing the proportion of each VFA by ANOVA, no differences were found between the sampling methods. The quantification of S. bovis and P. ruminicola was similar in both extraction methods, and values obtained using different methods were highly correlated (R(2)=0.89 and 0.98 for S. bovis and P. ruminicola, respectively). Fingerprinting analysis showed similar bacteria band profiles between samples obtained from the same calves using different extraction methods. In conclusion, when comparing rumen parameters obtained using different sampling techniques, it is recommended that VFA profiles be used rather than total VFA concentrations, as total VFA concentrations are more affected by the method of collection. Furthermore, although comparisons of pH across studies should be avoided when samples are not obtained using the same sampling method, the comparison of fingerprinting of a bacteria community or a specific rumen bacterium is valid.
TI  - Particularities in diagnosis and treatment for infectious endocarditis in children.
AB  - Infectious endocarditis (IE) represents a rare pathology in children, but with lethal potential. The goal of the therapy is fast and total eradication of the infection. AIMS: To study particularities in diagnosis and treatment for infectious endocarditis in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Children with infectious endocarditis hospitalized between January 2007 - February 2012 in the Cardiology Department of the ,,Sfanta Maria" Children Emergency Hospital of lasi have been included in the study. RESULTS: The patients are aged between 23 days and 16 years, the average age being 4 years old. At approximately 88% of the patients (14 cases), the endocardial damage appeared in the pre-existent valvular lesions, specially mitral and aortal. As associated congenital malformations, the patients prevailingly presented ventricular septal defect, mitral valve prolapse, arterial canal persistence, aortic stenosis, coarctation of the aorta. Blood cultures were collected and the most frequent identified etiological agents were: Staphylococcus coagulase-positive, Streptococcus mitis, Staphylococcus speciae coagulase-negative, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus bovis, Escherichia coli, for which the antibiogram showed sensitivity for beta-lactam, cephalosporins, glycopeptides, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, rifampicin, quinolone, lincosamides, oxazolidinones, and thus specific treatment was set up according to the antibiogram. CONCLUSIONS: The infectious endocarditis is a serious disease that affects young age too, leading towards exitus in some cases. Diagnostic imaging and early blood cultures are of relevance in order to intervene promptly. The treatment must be targeted and applied as fast as possible.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Brazilian propolis extracts against rumen bacteria in vitro.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of three Brazilian propolis extracts was evaluated on  bacterial strains representing major rumen functional groups. The extracts were prepared using different concentrations of propolis and alcohol, resulting in different phenolic compositions. The propolis extracts inhibited the growth of Fibrobacter succinogenes S85, Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1, Ruminococcus albus 7, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens D1, Prevotella albensis M384, Peptostreptococcus sp. D1, Clostridium aminophilum F and Streptococcus bovis Pearl11, while R. albus 20, Prevotella bryantii B(1)4 and Ruminobacter amylophilus H18 were resistant to all the extracts. The inhibited strains showed also different sensitivity to propolis; the hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria (C. aminophilum F and Peptostreptococcus sp. D1) being the most sensitive. Inhibition of hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria by propolis would be beneficial to the animal. The extract containing the lowest amount of phenolic compounds (LLOS C3) showed the lowest antimicrobial activity against all the bacteria. The major phenolic compounds identified in the propolis extracts (naringenin, chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and Artepillin C) were also evaluated on four sensitive strains. Only naringenin showed inhibitory effect against all strains, suggesting that naringenin is one of the components participating to the antibacterial activity of propolis.
TI  - Starchy biomass-powered enzymatic biofuel cell based on amylases and glucose oxidase multi-immobilized bioanode.
AB  - The present study reports the design of a novel bioanode to directly utilize starch as a fuel in an enzymatic biofuel cell. The enzymatic fuel cell is based on three enzymes (alpha-amylase, glucoamylase and glucose oxidase). The carbon paste electrode containing these three enzymes and tetrathiafulvalene can both saccharize and oxidize starchy biomass. In cyclic voltammetry, catalytic currents were successfully observed with both glucose and starchy white rice used as a substrate. Finally, a membrane-less white rice/O2 biofuel cell was assembled and the electrochemical performance was evaluated. The three enzyme based electrode was used as a bioanode and an immobilized bilirubin oxidase (derived from Myrothecium verrucaria) electrode was used as a biocathode. The biofuel cell delivered an open circuit voltage of 0.522V and power density of up to 99.0 muWcm(-2). Our results show that a readily available fuel can be used for enzymatic fuel cells, and will lead to new designs.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis-related cholecystitis.
AB  - Acute cholecystitis is a common inflammatory condition of the gallbladder caused  most commonly by Escherichia coli, Enterococcus, and Klebsiella organisms. Streptococcus bovis is a Gram-positive, catalase-negative, anaerobic coccus found as a commensal inhabitant of the digestive system in 16% of healthy people. We report a rare case of acute cholecystitis caused by S bovis and discuss its implications with regard to the two known S bovis biotypes (I & II) both of which are associated with a number of other gastrointestinal diseases.
TI  - Molecular characterization of alpha-amylase from Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is one of the prominent Gram positive human pathogen secretes many surface and secretary proteins including various enzymes and pathogenic factors that favour the successful colonization and infection of host tissue. alpha-amylase is one of the enzymes secreted by S. aureus which catalyses the breakdown of complex sugars to monosaccharides, which are required for colonization and survival of this pathogen in any anatomical locales. In the present study we have cloned, sequenced, expressed and characterized alpha-amylase gene from S. aureus ATCC12600. The recombinant enzyme has a molecular weight of 58kDa and the kinetics showed Vmax 0.0208+/-0.033 (mg/ml)/mg/min and Km 10.633+/-0.737mg/ml. The multiple sequence analysis showed alpha- amylase of S. aureus exhibited large differences with Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus bovis. As the crystal structure of S. aureus alpha- amylase was unavailable, we used homology modelling method to build the structure. The built structure was validated by Ramachandran plot which showed 90% of the residues in the allowed region while no residue was found in the disallowed region and the built structure was close to the crystal structure with Z-Score: -6.85. The structural superimposition studies with alpha- amylases of Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus bovis showed distinct differences with RMSD values of 18.158Aand 7.091A respectively which correlated with enzyme kinetics, indicating alpha-amylase is different among these bacteria.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex fecal carriage, colorectal carcinoma, and infective endocarditis: a new appraisal of a complex connection.
AB  - The proportion of group D streptococcal infective endocarditis (IE) (predominantly due to Streptococcus gallolyticus) and the incidence of colorectal cancer are higher in France than in most European countries. We assumed that this could be explained by a high group D streptococci (GDS) fecal carriage rate. The aims of this study were to re-assess the GDS fecal carriage rate in France and its relationship with colorectal cancer. Consecutive adult subjects who were to undergo a complete colonoscopy were invited to participate. GDS were searched in subjects' stools before their colonoscopy using biomolecular techniques. Colonoscopic findings were sorted into four subgroups: normal colonoscopy, non-tumoral lesions, benign tumors, and premalignant/malignant tumors. GDS fecal carriages were calculated overall and in each subgroup and compared. The data from 259 subjects were analyzed. GDS were identified in the feces of 12 subjects, with the following distribution: S. lutetiensis (n = 9), S. pasteurianus (n = 2), and S. gallolyticus (n = 1). This accounted for an overall GDS fecal carriage rate of 4.6 %. The GDS fecal carriage rate was 6 % in case of normal colonoscopy, 1.3 % in case of non-tumoral lesions, 3.2 % in case of benign tumors, and 11 % in case of premalignant/malignant tumors. These four percentages were not statistically different. The GDS fecal carriage rate was lower than expected, which did not confirm our working hypothesis. Most strains belonged to S. bovis biotype II, while S. gallolyticus was found only once. These findings suggest that different GDS play different roles in the etiopathogenesis of IE and colorectal cancer.
TI  - Association of Streptococcus bovis endocarditis and advanced colorectal neoplasia: a case-control study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the association between Streptococcus bovis (S. bovis) endocarditis and advanced colorectal neoplasia. METHODS: This was a case-control study of patients with S. bovis endocarditis undergoing colonoscopic evaluation. Patients were matched 1:20 with controls by gender and age (+/-2 years) from a large screening colonoscopy database. The baseline, colonoscopic and clinicopathological characteristics of patients with S. bovis endocarditis were analyzed. RESULTS: From 1996 to 2010, 18 adult patients with S. bovis bacteremia were identified, of whom 10 with infective endocarditis (IE) underwent colonoscopic evaluation. Endocarditis involved a native or prosthetic valve in six and four of those patients, respectively. All 10 patients recovered without recurrence of IE (mean follow-up duration 49.6 months). None had a concurrent or preceding history of colon disease and only one had subclinical chronic liver disease. Advanced neoplasia, defined as the presence of polyps >/=1 cm (n = 6), villous histology (n = 3), high-grade focal dysplasia (n = 1) or cancer (n = 1), was found under colonoscopy in 6 of the 10 cases (60.0%) compared with 13/200 (6.5%) matched controls (OR 21.6, 95% CI 5.4-86.1, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: S. bovis endocarditis is strongly associated with the presence of advanced colorectal neoplasia. In the absence of any contraindication, colonoscopic examination is strongly recommended in patients with endocarditis. The exact pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this association and the predilection for S. bovis bacteremia in patients with advanced colonic neoplasia remain unclear.
TI  - Effect on quarter milk somatic cell count and antimicrobial susceptibility of Staphylococcus rostri causing intramammary infection in dairy water buffaloes.
AB  - In many parts of the world, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) are the predominant cause of intramammary infections (IMI) in dairy cows and in water buffaloes, as well. A longitudinal field study was carried out on one well-managed dairy water buffalo herd to determine the prevalence and distribution of CNS and a recently described CNS-species, Staphylococcus rostri, in milk samples to explore its relevance for buffaloes' udder health throughout lactation, and to gain insight into the susceptibility of the latter species toward commonly used antimicrobials. Twice weekly quarter milk samples from a cohort of 11 lactating water buffaloes were collected over an 8-mo period. The CNS (n=109; 76.2% of all culture-positive samples) were the predominant pathogens causing IMI, followed by Corynebacterium bovis (n=11; 7.6%) and Streptococcus spp. (n=9; 6.2%) other than Stretococcus uberis (n=2; 1.4%). Thirty-seven hemolytic staphylococci suspected to be Staphylococcus aureus were further differentiated using transfer DNA-intergenic spacer-PCR and rpoB-gene sequencing because they were coagulase-negative. Thirty-three of those isolates were identified as Staph. rostri, whereas 2 others were identified as Staphylococcus epidermidis. None of the Staph. rostri isolates displayed resistance to the antimicrobial agents tested. Mean quarter milk somatic cell count (qSCC) of all samples collected throughout lactation was 20,970 cells/mL. The qSCC at sampling of quarters infected with Staph. rostri (34,466 cells/mL) and CNS other than Staph. rostri (34,813 cells/mL) were significantly higher than the qSCC of noninfected quarters (20,287 cells/mL), yet not significantly different from each other. These findings provide novel insight into the prevalence and distribution, antimicrobial susceptibility, and relevance of Staph. rostri compared with other CNS species causing IMI in water buffaloes. Further studies are needed to pinpoint the relevance, niches, and transmission routes of Staph. rostri, as well as other CNS in water buffaloes.
TI  - Milk haptoglobin, milk amyloid A, and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity in bovines with naturally occurring clinical mastitis diagnosed with a quantitative PCR test.
AB  - The associations between quantitative bacteriological results from a real-time PCR test and concentrations of acute-phase proteins (APP) and N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (NAGase) activity in milk in naturally occurring clinical mastitis were investigated. Milk APP concentrations and NAGase activity in clinical mastitis caused by different udder pathogens were studied. The associations between the severity of the clinical signs and concentrations of APP and NAGase activity were estimated. Milk samples from 281 cases of clinical mastitis were collected from 3 Estonian dairy farms and analyzed by PCR to identify pathogens. Twenty-seven samples out of 281 (9.6%) were PCR negative. Milk samples containing 4 or more bacterial species (n=28) were considered possibly contaminated and excluded from all further analyses. In total, 443 bacterial identifications were made from the remaining 226 milk samples. A single bacterial species was detected in 68 samples (30.1%), 2 species were detected in 99 samples (43.8%), and 3 species were detected in 59 (26.1%) samples. To determine the inflammatory response in the udder, the concentrations of milk amyloid A (MAA) and haptoglobin (Hp) and NAGase activity in the milk were analyzed. A significant positive association was found between the severity of the clinical signs and inflammatory markers in the milk. Milk amyloid A and Hp concentrations and NAGase activity were significantly higher in samples with large quantities of bacterial DNA from Escherichia coli or Streptococcus dysgalactiae compared with milk samples not containing those species. Large quantities of bacterial DNA from Trueperella pyogenes or Streptococcus uberis in the milk were associated with elevated concentrations of Hp and high NAGase activity, but not with increased MAA concentrations. Milk samples containing Corynebacterium bovis and coagulase-negative staphylococci had significantly lower concentrations of MAA and Hp and lower NAGase activity compared with samples where these species were not detected. It can be concluded that concentrations of APP and NAGase activity in the milk were associated with the quantity of bacterial DNA in the milk samples.
TI  - Competence for natural genetic transformation in the Streptococcus bovis group streptococci S. infantarius and S. macedonicus.
AB  - Natural genetic transformation is common among many species of the genus Streptococcus, but it has never, or rarely, been reported for the Streptococcus pyogenes and S. bovis groups of species, even though many streptococcal competence genes and the competence regulators SigX, ComR, and ComS are well conserved in both groups. To explore the incidence of competence in the S. bovis group, 25 isolates of S. infantarius and S. macedonicus were surveyed by employing culture in chemically defined media devoid of peptide nutrients and treatment with synthetic candidate pheromone peptides predicted from the sequence of the gene comS. Approximately half of strains examined were transformable, many transforming at high rates comparable to those for the well-characterized streptococcal natural transformation systems. In S. infantarius, nanomolar amounts of the synthetic pheromone LTAWWGL induced robust but transient competence in high-density cultures, but mutation of the ComRS locus abolished transformation. We conclude that at least these two species of the S. bovis group retain a robust system of natural transformation regulated by a ComRS pheromone circuit and the alternative sigma factor SigX and infer that transformation is even more common among the streptococci than has been recognized. The tools presented here will facilitate targeted genetic manipulation in this group of streptococci.
TI  - Safety evaluation of the antimicrobial peptide bovicin HC5 orally administered to a murine model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bovicin HC5 is an antimicrobial peptide that shows a broad spectrum of activity and potential for biotechnological and therapeutic applications. To gain insight about the safety of bovicin HC5 application, the histological and immunostimulatory effects of orally administrated bovicin HC5 to BALB/c mice were evaluated. BALB/c mice were divided into three groups: negative control (NC group); mice given purified bovicin HC5 (Bov group); mice given ovalbumin (positive control, PC group; a murine model of enteropathy). The mice were initially pre-sensitized, and PBS, bovicin HC5 or ovalbumin were administered for 30 days by daily gavages. Histological and morphometric analysis were performed and the relative expression of cytokines was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: The oral administration of bovicin HC5 to BALB/c mice reduced weight gain and caused alterations in the small intestine, although absorptive changes have not been detected. The number of total goblet cells and the mucopolysaccharides production were not affected by bovicin HC5 administration. A hypertrophy of Paneth cells and an increase in the number of mitotic cells were observed in Bov group, while the number of mast cells remained unaltered. Increased expression of TNF-alpha, INF-gamma and IL-12 was observed in the small intestine upon bovicin HC5 administration. CONCLUSION: Bovicin HC5 has only minor effects on intestinal permeability and did not elicit an allergenic response upon oral administration to animal models. Considering the low in vivo toxicity of bovicin HC5, it might be a good candidate for enteral applications.
TI  - Relationship between concentration of lingual antimicrobial peptide and somatic cell count in milk of dairy cows.
AB  - Lingual antimicrobial peptide (LAP) belongs to the beta-defensin family in cattle and is found in milk. LAP concentrations increase in milk from mastitic udders; however, the relationship between LAP concentrations and the somatic cell count (SCC) in milk remains to be elucidated in detail. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to investigate the relationship between LAP concentrations and the SCC in bovine milk to assess whether LAP may be used as an indicator of SCC. Milk was collected from 66 udders showing various SCCs. The SCC and LAP concentrations were measured in the milk. A significantly higher LAP concentration was observed in milk having 500-5000 x 10(3)cells/ml and >5000 x 10(3)cells/ml SCC groups than in lower SCC groups (<50 x 10(3)cells/ml and 50-500 x 10(3)cells/ml). A significantly positive correlation between LAP concentrations and SCCs in milk was observed (r=0.68). In milk samples with >26 nM of LAP, 92.0% of milk samples had high SCCs (>200 x 10(3)cells/ml). The concentration of LAP in milk infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Escherichia coli was significantly higher than that in uninfected milk. These results suggest that the concentration of LAP can be a useful indicator of the SCC in dairy cows.
TI  - Insight into the evolution of the histidine triad protein (HTP) family in Streptococcus.
AB  - The Histidine Triad Proteins (HTPs), also known as Pht proteins in Streptococcus  pneumoniae, constitute a family of surface-exposed proteins that exist in many pathogenic streptococcal species. Although many studies have revealed the importance of HTPs in streptococcal physiology and pathogenicity, little is known about their origin and evolution. In this study, after identifying all htp homologs from 105 streptococcal genomes representing 38 different species/subspecies, we analyzed their domain structures, positions in genome, and most importantly, their evolutionary histories. By further projecting this information onto the streptococcal phylogeny, we made several major findings. First, htp genes originated earlier than the Streptococcus genus and gene-loss events have occurred among three streptococcal groups, resulting in the absence of the htp gene in the Bovis, Mutans and Salivarius groups. Second, the copy number of htp genes in other groups of Streptococcus is variable, ranging from one to four functional copies. Third, both phylogenetic evidence and domain structure analyses support the division of two htp subfamilies, designated as htp I and htp II. Although present mainly in the pyogenic group and in Streptococcus suis, htp II members are distinct from htp I due to the presence of an additional leucine-rich-repeat domain at the C-terminus. Finally, htp genes exhibit a faster nucleotide substitution rate than do housekeeping genes. Specifically, the regions outside the HTP domains are under strong positive selection. This distinct evolutionary pattern likely helped Streptococcus to easily escape from recognition by host immunity.
TI  - Comparative genome analysis of Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius CJ18, an African fermented camel milk isolate with adaptations to dairy environment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius (Sii) belongs to the Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex associated with several human and animal infections. Sii is a predominant bacterium in spontaneously fermented milk products in Africa. The genome sequence of Sii strain CJ18 was compared with that of other Streptococcus species to identify dairy adaptations including genome decay such as in Streptococcus thermophilus, traits for its competitiveness in spontaneous milk fermentation and to assess potential health risks for consumers. RESULTS: The genome of Sii CJ18 harbors several unique regions in comparison to Sii ATCC BAA-102T, among others an enlarged exo- and capsular polysaccharide operon; Streptococcus thermophilus-associated genes; a region containing metabolic and hypothetical genes mostly unique to CJ18 and the dairy isolate Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus; and a second oligopeptide transport operon. Dairy adaptations in CJ18 are reflected by a high percentage of pseudogenes (4.9%) representing genome decay which includes the inactivation of the lactose phosphotransferase system (lacIIABC) by multiple transposases integration. The presence of lacS and lacZ genes is the major dairy adaptation affecting lactose metabolism pathways also due to the disruption of lacIIABC.We constructed mutant strains of lacS, lacZ and lacIIABC and analyzed the resulting strains of CJ18 to confirm the redirection of lactose metabolism via LacS and LacZ.Natural competence genes are conserved in both Sii strains, but CJ18 contains a lower number of CRISPR spacers which indicates a reduced defense capability against alien DNA. No classical streptococcal virulence factors were detected in both Sii strains apart from those involved in adhesion which should be considered niche factors. Sii-specific virulence factors are not described. Several Sii-specific regions encoding uncharacterized proteins provide new leads for virulence analyses and investigation of the unclear association of dairy and clinical Sii with human diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The genome of the African dairy isolate Sii CJ18 clearly differs from the human isolate ATCC BAA-102T. CJ18 possesses a high natural competence predisposition likely explaining the enlarged genome. Metabolic adaptations to the dairy environment are evident and especially lactose uptake corresponds to S. thermophilus. Genome decay is not as advanced as in S. thermophilus (10-19%) possibly due to a shorter history in dairy fermentations.
TI  - The diagnostic utility of transthoracic echocardiography for the diagnosis of infective endocarditis in the real world of the Italian Registry on Infective Endocarditis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The choice of the imaging modality (transthoracic [TTE] vs. transesophageal echocardiography [TEE]) for the diagnosis of infective endocarditis (IE) depends on different variables. Aim of the present study is to provide updated data on the diagnostic sensitivity and the clinical usefulness of TTE vs. TEE from the Italian Registry on IE (RIEI). METHODS: The RIEI has enrolled consecutive cases of IE in every participating centre, evaluating diagnostic and therapeutic data from a real world practice perspective. RESULTS: From July 2007 to October 2010, 658 consecutive cases with definite IE according to Duke criteria have been enrolled in the RIEI (483 males). The following diagnostic echocardiographic exams were performed: 616 TTE (94%) and 476 TEE (72%). A positive TTE was recorded in 399 cases (65%), an uncertain TTE in 108 cases (17%), and a negative TTE in 109 cases (18%). For TEE, a positive study was reported in 451 cases (95%), uncertain in 13 cases (2.7%), and negative in 12 cases (2.5%) (P < 0.001). This difference is not evident in patients with tricuspid valve IE or i.v. drug addiction, and in Streptococcus bovis or Streptococcus viridans IE. TTE was significantly more performed before the admission and earlier than TEE during admission (P = 0.000). TTE was mainly responsible for the initial diagnosis in 59%. TEE contributed to changing the therapeutic approach in 42%. CONCLUSIONS: In the real world, TTE is performed earlier and more commonly, and it is the major echocardiographic tool for the initial diagnosis. TEE confirms its superior diagnostic sensitivity in most cases, although it is relatively underused.
TI  - [Streptococcus bovis, taxonomic status, clinical relevance and antimicrobial susceptibility].
AB  - Streptococcus bovis is a large bacterial complex of facultative anaerobic Gram-positive cocci that includes distinct, genetically-related species. Traditionally, S. bovis was classified into three biotypes: I (mannitol fermentation-positive), II/1 (mannitol-negative and beta-glucuronidase-negative), and II/2 (mannitol-negative and beta-glucuronidase-positive). The introduction of molecular techniques in the last few decades has led to proposals for a genetic classification of this complex: S. bovis biotype I belongs to Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, S. bovis biotype II/1 is, in fact, Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius, designated as Streptococcus lutetiensis, and S. bovis biotype II/2 is Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, commonly designated as Streptococcus pasteurianus. Although this modern taxonomy is currently accepted, many clinicians remain unfamiliar with these terms. The importance of correct identification lies in the strong association between bacteriemia, endocarditis and/or colon cancer and the various subspecies. In general, S. bovis is more susceptible to antimicrobial agents than other streptococci, but high levels of resistance to macrolides and tetracycline have been described.
TI  - Early in vitro and in vivo development of high-level daptomycin resistance is common in mitis group Streptococci after exposure to daptomycin.
AB  - The development of high-level daptomycin resistance (HLDR; MIC of >/= 256 mg/liter) after exposure to daptomycin has recently been reported in viridans group streptococcus (VGS) isolates. Our study objectives were as follows: to know whether in vitro development of HLDR after exposure to daptomycin was common among clinical isolates of VGS and Streptococcus bovis; to determine whether HLDR also developed during the administration of daptomycin to treat experimental endocarditis caused by the daptomycin-susceptible, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus mitis strain S. mitis 351; and to establish whether combination with gentamicin prevented the development of HLDR in vitro and in vivo. In vitro studies were performed with 114 VGS strains (mitis group, 92; anginosus group, 10; mutans group, 8; and salivarius group, 4) and 54 Streptococcus bovis strains isolated from 168 consecutive patients with infective endocarditis diagnosed between 1995 and 2010. HLDR was only observed after 24 h of exposure to daptomycin in 27% of the mitis group, including 27% of S. mitis isolates, 47% of S. oralis isolates, and 13% of S. sanguis isolates. In our experimental model, HLDR was detected in 7/11 (63%) and 8/12 (67%) isolates recovered from vegetations after 48 h of daptomycin administered at 6 mg/kg of body weight/24 h and 10 mg/kg/24 h, respectively. In vitro, time-kill experiments showed that daptomycin plus gentamicin was bactericidal against S. mitis 351 at tested concentrations of 0.5 and 1 times the MIC and prevented the development of HLDR. In vivo, the addition of gentamicin at 1 mg/kg/8 h to both daptomycin arms prevented HLDR in 21 out of 23 (91%) rabbits. Daptomycin plus gentamicin was at least as effective as vancomycin plus gentamicin. In conclusion, HLDR develops rapidly and frequently in vitro and in vivo among mitis group streptococci. Combining daptomycin with gentamicin enhanced its activity and prevented the development of HLDR in most cases.

TI  - Occurrence of bacteriuria in 18 catheterised cats with obstructive lower urinary  tract disease: a pilot study.
AB  - The incidence of catheter-associated urinary tract infections in cats catheterised for an obstructive lower urinary tract disease (LUTD) has not previously been evaluated. The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of significant bacteriuria in cats with obstructive LUTD managed for 48 h with a closed urine collection system. Eighteen male cats admitted for a non-infectious obstructive LUTD were evaluated. This was a prospective study. A standard protocol was used for aseptic catheter placement and maintenance. Three urine samples were collected from each animal through the catheter immediately after placement, 24 h after placement and just before removal. All samples underwent complete urinalysis, including bacterial culture. Catheter tips were tested by bacterial culture. Six cats (33.3%) developed significant bacteriuria during catheterisation. The causative bacteria were common feline uropathogens (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus species) in five cases, and Streptococcus bovis in one. One cat developed a fungal infection. The presence of bacteria in urinary sediment was correlated strongly with positive urine culture results. The catheter tips from 10/18 cats (55.5%) were positive for culture. The positive predictive value of a positive culture from the urinary catheter tip was 87.5%. The specificity was 53.8%. The same infectious agents were cultured from both urine and catheter tip in six cases. In summary, one-third of cats developed significant bacteriuria during catheterisation. Silent bacteriuria could not be clearly differentiated from true urinary tract infection. The presence of bacteria in the urinary sediment was strongly indicative of bacteriuria. The specificity of urinary catheter tip culture was low.
TI  - Streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus meningitis in an infant: a case report and literature review.
AB  - A case of 6-week-old male infant with meningitis and concurrent bacteremia caused by Streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus (Streptococcus bovis biotype 11.2) is presented. The isolates were susceptible to all beta-lactam antibiotics. Nevertheless, delayed defervescence and lack of satisfactory clinical improvement after treatment with multiple beta-lactam antibiotics prompted the combination therapy of vancomycin and penicillin G. The patient completed a 2-week course of antibiotics and recovered uneventfully.
TI  - Efficient synthesis of L-lactic acid from glycerol by metabolically engineered Escherichia coli.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to its abundance and low-price, glycerol has become an attractive carbon source for the industrial production of value-added fuels and chemicals. This work reports the engineering of E. coli for the efficient conversion of glycerol into L-lactic acid (L-lactate). RESULTS: Escherichia coli strains have previously been metabolically engineered for the microaerobic production of D-lactic acid from glycerol in defined media by disrupting genes that minimize the synthesis of succinate, acetate, and ethanol, and also overexpressing the respiratory route of glycerol dissimilation (GlpK/GlpD). Here, further rounds of rationale design were performed on these strains for the homofermentative production of L-lactate, not normally produced in E. coli. Specifically, L-lactate production was enabled by: 1), replacing the native D-lactate specific dehydrogenase with Streptococcus bovis L-lactate dehydrogenase (L-LDH), 2) blocking the methylglyoxal bypass pathways to avoid the synthesis of a racemic mixture of D- and L-lactate and prevent the accumulation of toxic intermediate, methylglyoxal, and 3) the native aerobic L-lactate dehydrogenase was blocked to prevent the undesired utilization of L-lactate. The engineered strain produced 50 g/L of L-lactate from 56 g/L of crude glycerol at a yield 93% of the theoretical maximum and with high optical (99.9%) and chemical (97%) purity. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the efficient conversion of glycerol to L-lactate, a microbial process that had not been reported in the literature prior to our work. The engineered biocatalysts produced L-lactate from crude glycerol in defined minimal salts medium at high chemical and optical purity.
TI  - Long-term clinical outcomes after Streptococcus bovis isolation in asymptomatic blood donors in Hong Kong.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Risk of transfusion-transmitted bacterial sepsis has been substantially reduced by a bacterial surveillance program (BST). However, new problems emerge as asymptomatic bacteremia is detected in blood donors. Streptococcus bovis bacteremia, which is known to associate with infective endocarditis and colonic carcinoma, is an example. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to examine the demographic and clinical outcome of this group of donors. All confirmed culture-positive cases under the BST were retrieved and those donors with S. bovis bacteremia were contacted for follow-up. Viable culture samples were sent for detailed microbiologic analysis. RESULTS: From 1998 to 2012, a total of 16 donors were found to have S. bovis bacteremia, giving an estimated prevalence of 1 in 110,800 donations. They consisted of nine men and seven women with median age of 43.5 years. Eight donors had undergone colonoscopy with colonic carcinoma detected in two and benign adenoma in four. Five of the 16 isolates could be retrieved for 16S DNA sequencing. Four were identified as S. gallolyticus ssp. pasteurianus and one as S. gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus. The two patients with colonic carcinoma had one each of subspecies pasteurianus and gallolyticus. CONCLUSION: The findings highlight a close association of S. bovis and colonic carcinoma. We recommend prompt donor follow-up if S. bovis bacteremia is detected. Besides, all confirmed S. bovis should be fully characterized by molecular technique.
TI  - Effects of soybean small peptides on rumen fermentation and on intestinal and total tract digestion of luxi yellow cattle.
AB  - Four Luxi beef cattle (400+/-10 kg) fitted with ruminal, duodenal and ileal cannulas were used in a 4x4 Latin square to assess the effects of soybean small peptide (SSP) infusion on rumen fermentation, diet digestion and flow of nutrient in the gastrointestinal tract. The ruminal infusion of SSP was 0 (control), 100, 200 and 300 g/d. Ruminal SSP infusion linearly (p<0.01) and quadratically (p<0.01) increased microbial protein synthesis and rumen ammonia-N concentration. Concentrations of total volatile fatty acid were linearly increased (p = 0.029) by infusion SSP. Rumen samples were obtained for analysis of microbial ecology by real-time PCR. Populations of rumen Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Streptococcus bovis, Ciliate protozoa, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Prevotella ruminicola were expressed as a proportion of total Rumen bacterial 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA). Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens populations which related to total bacterial 16S rDNA were increased (p<0.05), while Streptococcus bovis populations were linearly (p = 0.049) and quadratically (p = 0.020) decreased by infusion of SSP. Apparent rumen digestibility of DM and NDF were (Q, p<0.05; L, p<0.05) increased with infusion SSP. Total tract digestion of DM, OM and NDF were linearly (p<0.01) and quadratically (p<0.01) increased by infusing SSP. The flow of total amino acids (AA), essential amino acids (EAA) and individual amino acids were linearly (p<0.01) and quadratically (p<0.01) increased with infusion SSP. The digestibility of Lysine was quadratically (p = 0.033) increased and apparent degradability of Arginine was linearly (p = 0.032) and quadratically (p = 0.042) increased with infusion SSP. The results indicated that infusion SSP could improve nutrient digestion, ruminal fermentation and AA availability.
TI  - Mastitis diagnosis in dairy cows using PathoProof real-time polymerase chain reaction assay in comparison with conventional bacterial culture in a Northern German field study.
AB  - In the following field study, the commercial PathoProof Mastitis PCR Assay, a real-time PCR for identifying eleven mastitis pathogens and the staphylococcal beta-lactamase gene, was compared with conventional bacterial culture. For this purpose, 681 udder quarter samples from 173 clinically healthy cows with varying somatic cell count from four dairy herds in the region of Osnabruck, Lower Saxony, Germany, were collected between July 2010 and February 2011 and subjected to PCR and bacterial culture. The frequency of positive pathogen signals was markedly higher with PCR compared with culture (70.6% vs. 32.2%). This was accompanied by a substantial higher percentage of multiple pathogen identifications and a lower percentage of single identifications in the PCR compared with bacterial culture. Using bacterial culture as gold standard, moderate to high sensitivities (76.9-100%) and specificities (63.3-98.7%) were calculated for six out of seven pathogens with sufficient detection numbers. For Enterococcus spp, the sensitivity was only 9.1%. When the PCR results of pooled udder quarter samples of the 173 cows were compared with the single udder quarter samples, in 72% of the cases, major pathogen DNA was either not found in both types of samples, or in the case of a positive pool sample, the respective pathogens were found in at least one udder quarter sample. With both methods, the most frequently detected mastitis pathogens were coryneform bacteria (PCR: Corynebacterium bovis), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) and Staphylococcus (S.) aureus, followed by Arcanobacterium pyogenes/Peptoniphilus indolicus with PCR, and then with both methods, Streptococcus uberis. The staphylococcal beta-lactamase gene was found in 27.7% of the S. aureus and in 37.0% of the CNS identifications.

TI  - Streptococcus bovis endocarditis and colon cancer: myth or reality? A case report and literature review.
AB  - A relationship between infective endocarditis and colon cancer was established in 1950, and Streptococcus bovis was successfully isolated in 1970. However, this association and its pathogenesis still remain unclear. In this paper, we describe the clinical case of a patient with a history of colon cancer and infective endocarditis caused by Streptococcus bovis. The role of S bovis as an aetiological agent in the development of colon cancer is intriguing but uncertain. S bovis infection should be considered a silent sign of gastrointestinal malignancy or hepatic disease. We believe that in order to demonstrate the presence of colon cancer, all patients with S bovis infection require an endoscopic investigation of the colon.
TI  - Potentiation by metal ions of the efficacy of the ionophores, monensin and tetronasin, towards four species of ruminal bacteria.
AB  - Concentrations of Na(+), K(+) and Ca(2+) in the growth medium were varied within  limits normally found in vivo to determine how cation concentrations affect the sensitivity of ruminal bacteria to the ionophores, monensin (a Na(+)/H(+) and K(+)/H(+) exchanger) and tetronasin (Ca(2+)/H(+)). High [Na(+)] (172 mM cf. 137 mM in control medium) enhanced the efficacy of monensin towards Eubacterium ruminantium 2388, Streptococcus bovis C277, Lactobacillus casei LB17 and Prevotella albensis M384. High [K(+)] (35 mM cf. 19 mM) alone caused a decreased potency of both ionophores, except with L. casei. Added Ca(2+) (7.4 cf. 2.8 mM) increased the potency of tetronasin when [Na(+)] was low. High [Na(+)] alone also potentiated the efficacy of tetronasin. Monensin caused intracellular [Na(+)] and [K(+)] to be decreased in the most sensitive of these organisms, E. ruminantium, whereas only intracellular [Ca(2+)] fell with tetronasin. The changes were small; however, Deltap fell by only 20 mV after 2 h when ionophores caused immediate cessation of growth. ATP concentrations fell by 77% and 75% with monensin and tetronasin, respectively. Thus, altering cation concentrations might be used to potentiate the efficacy of ionophores, by increasing the rate of energy expenditure to maintain ionic homoeostasis in sensitive bacteria.
TI  - [Effects of secondary structure of the leader peptide on modification and processing of bovicin HJ50].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Elucidating the correlation between the secondary structure of the leader peptide of lantibiotic bovicin HJ50 and its modification and processing. METHODS: The variants with mutated leader peptide were synthesized by semi-in vitro biosynthesis, and their modification pattern were then analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. At the same time, the effect of leader peptide mutants on processing the modified propeptide was examined by HPLC and antimicrobial activity. RESULTS: We constructed 6 mutants (F-16A, V-15E, E-14L, E-8P, L-7D, L-4K) involved in forming secondary structure of the bovicin HJ50 leader peptide. F-16A, V-15E, L-4K showed very little effect on modification and processing whereas E-14L and E-8P caused changes in modification. In addition, we found that L-7D strongly affected the processing. CONCLUSION: The conserved helix structure in the leader peptide of bovicin HJ50 was closely related to the activity of BovM and BovT150, and the presence of secondary structure was very important to modification and processing of bovicin HJ50.
TI  - [Role of infectious agents in the emergence of malignant tumors].
AB  - According to the data of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC),  at least 6 virus species (HPV, EBV, HHV-8/KSHV, HTLV-1, HBV, HCV), 4 helminthes species (Schistosoma haematobium and japonicum, Opisthorchis viverrini, Clonorchis sinensis) and I bacterium species (Helicobacter pylori) have been proved to be capable of causing the development of cancer. The analysis of the data available shows that Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), John Cunningham polyomavirus (JCV), monkey virus 40 (SV40), cytomegalovirus (CMV), xenotropic murine leukemia virus (XMRV), Helicobacter bilis and hepaticus, Campylobacter jejuni, Fusobacterium varium, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Prevotella spp., Streptococcus bovis and anginosus, Treponema denticola, Salmonella typhi, paratyphi and typhimurium, Borrelia burgdorferi, Bartonella spp., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, trachomatis and psittaci, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Propionibacterium acnes, Tropheryma whippelii, Schistosoma mansoni, Opistorchis felineus, Strongyloides stercoralis, Taenia solium, Candida spp., Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Histoplasma capsulatum and Trichomonas vaginalis can also be potential etiological agents of cancer. Apparently, detection of new associations between infectious agents and risk of the development of cancer will facilitate progress in elaboration of prophylaxis measures, early diagnostic methods and, probably, methods of treatment of malignant tumors.
TI  - Characterization of a new CAMP factor carried by an integrative and conjugative element in Streptococcus agalactiae and spreading in Streptococci.
AB  - Genetic exchanges between Streptococci occur frequently and contribute to their genome diversification. Most of sequenced streptococcal genomes carry multiple mobile genetic elements including Integrative and Conjugative Elements (ICEs) that play a major role in these horizontal gene transfers. In addition to genes involved in their mobility and regulation, ICEs also carry genes that can confer selective advantages to bacteria. Numerous elements have been described in S. agalactiae especially those integrated at the 3' end of a tRNA(Lys) encoding gene. In strain 515 of S. agalactiae, an invasive neonate human pathogen, the ICE (called 515_tRNA(Lys)) is functional and carries different putative virulence genes including one encoding a putative new CAMP factor in addition to the one previously described. This work demonstrated the functionality of this CAMP factor (CAMP factor II) in Lactococcus lactis but also in pathogenic strains of veterinary origin. The search for co-hemolytic factors in a collection of field strains revealed their presence in S. uberis, S. dysgalactiae, but also for the first time in S. equisimilis and S. bovis. Sequencing of these genes revealed the prevalence of a species-specific factor in S. uberis strains (Uberis factor) and the presence of a CAMP factor II encoding gene in S. bovis and S. equisimilis. Furthermore, most of the CAMP factor II positive strains also carried an element integrated in the tRNA(Lys) gene. This work thus describes a CAMP factor that is carried by a mobile genetic element and has spread to different streptococcal species.
TI  - Effects of the oral administration of viable and heat-killed Streptococcus bovis  HC5 cells to pre-sensitized BALB/c mice.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides have been suggested as an alternative to classical antibiotics in livestock production and bacteriocin-producing bacteria could be added to animal feeds to deliver bacteriocins in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of ruminant and monogastric animals. In this study, viable (V) and heat-killed (HK) Streptococcus bovis HC5 cells were orally administered to pre-sensitized mice in order to assess the effects of a bacteriocin-producing bacteria on histological parameters and the immune response of the GI tract of monogastric animals. The administration of V and HK S. bovis HC5 cells during 58 days to BALB/c mice did not affect weight gain, but an increase in gut permeability was detected in animals receiving the HK cells. Viable and heat killed cells caused similar morphological alterations in the GI tract of the animals, but the most prominent effects were detected in the small intestine. The oral administration of S. bovis HC5 also influenced cytokine production in the small intestine, and the immune-mediated activity differed between V and HK cells. The relative expression of IL-12 and INF-gamma was significantly higher in the small intestine of mice treated with V cells, while an increase in IL-5, IL-13 and TNF-alpha expression was only detected in mice treated with HK cells. Considering that even under a condition of severe challenge (pre-sensitization followed by daily exposure to the same bacterial immunogen) the general health of the animals was maintained, it appears that oral administration of S. bovis HC5 cells could be a useful route to deliver bacteriocin in the GI tract of livestock animals.
TI  - Macedovicin, the second food-grade lantibiotic produced by Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198.
AB  - Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198 was found to produce a second lantibiotic named macedovicin in addition to macedocin. Macedovicin was purified to homogeneity and mass spectrometric analysis identified a peptide of approximately 3.4 kDa. Partial N-terminal sequence analysis and tandem mass spectrometry revealed that macedovicin was identical to bovicin HJ50 and thermophilin 1277 produced by Streptococcus bovis and Streptococcus thermophilus, respectively. Macedovicin inhibits a broad spectrum of lactic acid bacteria, several food spoilage species (e.g. Clostridium spp.) and oral streptococci. We determined the complete biosynthetic gene cluster of macedovicin. Even though the gene clusters of macedovicin, thermophilin 1277 and bovicin HJ50 were almost identical at the nucleotide level, there were important differences in their predicted genes and proteins. Bovicin HJ50-like lantibiotics were also found to be encoded by Streptococcus suis strains SC84 and D12, Enterococcus columbae PLCH2, Clostridium perfringens JGS1721 and several Bacillus strains. All these lantibiotics contained a number of conserved amino acids that may be important for their biosynthesis and activity, while phylogenetic analysis supported their dispersion by horizontal gene transfer. In conclusion, the production of multiple bacteriocins may enhance the bio-protective potential of S. macedonicus during food fermentation.
TI  - Proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. Bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. The objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. METHOD: Bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. Proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an ELISA plate reader and zymography. RESULTS: We identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. Of these, six were Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium, and Streptococcus bovis) and seven were Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Serratia marcescens) organisms. Two of these, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, are recognized wound pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. Matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.
TI  - Lipopeptide biosurfactants from Paenibacillus polymyxa inhibit single and mixed species biofilms.
AB  - Although biofilms are recognised as important in microbial colonisation, solutions to their inhibition are predominantly based on planktonic assays. These solutions have limited efficacy against biofilms. Here, a series of biofilm-orientated tests were used to identify anti-biofilm compounds from marine micro-flora. This led to the isolation of a complex of anti-biofilm compounds from an extract of Paenibacillus polymyxa (PPE). A combination of rpHPLC and mass spectrometry identified the principle components of PPE as fusaricidin B (LI-FO4b) and polymyxin D1, with minor contributions from surfactins. This complex (PPE) reduced the biofilm biomass of Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus bovis. In contrast, ampicillin was only effective against S. aureus. PPE also inhibited a self-assembling marine biofilm (SAMB) in co-incubation assays by 99.3% +/- 1.9 and disrupted established SAMB by 72.4% +/- 4.4, while ampicillin showed no significant reduction. The effectiveness of this complex of lipopeptides against single and multispecies biofilms suggests a future role in biofilm prevention strategies.
TI  - Early onset neonatal bacterial meningitis caused by Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. paste urianus.
AB  - We report a case of neonatal meningitis due to Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp.  pasteurianus born to a mother with an asymptomatic urinary tract infection due to Streptococcus group D and Escherichia coli. In the past, this organism may have been reported as Streptococcus bovis or S. bovis biotype II/2. Accurate identification of this organism is necessary to determine the etiology of infection and give correct treatment of neonatal meningitis, caused by this organism.
TI  - Persistent fever in a multicomplicated infective endocarditis.
AB  
TI  - [Fever as the presenting manifestation of colon cancer: a case series of 11 patients].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fever happens frequently in colon cancer but it is rarely the presenting manifestation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report a case series of patients with colon cancer revealed by fever in the three military hospitals in Paris. RESULTS: Of the 11 patients studied, seven were men and four were women, and their mean age was 70 years. Cancer was localized in the sigmoid colon (n=6), left colon (n=3) and right colon (n=2). Cancer staging (UICC TNM classification 2002) was respectively pTis (n=1), I (n=4), II (n=3) and III (n=3). Fever was the only reason for admission and two patients had a recurrent fever of unknown origin. All patients but one had bacterial infection. Blood cultures grew up in six cases, Escherichia coli (n=3), Streptococcus gallolyticus (ex bovis) (n=2) and anaerobic bacteria (n=1). There was one case of infective endocarditis caused by S. gallolyticus. Imaging showed a liver abscess (n=3) and a colon cancer complicated by an abscess (n=3). In seven patients, a familial history of colon cancer and symptoms of underlying colic disease were present (neglected rectal bleeding, iron deficiency anaemia, clinical evidence of an abdominal mass). CONCLUSIONS: Fever may reveal colon cancer at an early stage. Its main cause is a bacterial infection, such as bacteremia or abscess. Fever of unknown origin is a rare presentation. Detailed history, careful clinical examination and analysis of imaging contribute to recommend the prescription of colonoscopy.
TI  - Significant bacterial contamination risk reduction with the use of diversion pouch.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Significant efforts have been made towards bacterial risk minimization by limiting the chance of bacteria entering into collected blood, detecting its presence and eliminating them by pathogen reduction technology. Improved skin disinfection and the use of diversion pouch are effective upstream measures to reduce the risk of bacterial sepsis. Here we report on our experience with the use of blood bags with diversion pouch. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational study was performed to compare the bacterial contamination rate for two periods of time, i.e. before and after introduction of diversion pouch into blood bags. The incidence of bacterial contamination was monitored by the existing bacterial surveillance programme using pooled samples from 5 units of random donor platelets underwent aerobic culture in the BacT/ALERT 3D system. RESULTS: Between 1 June 2004 and 31 May 2006 (blood bag without diversion pouch), 50 (0.0213%) out of 234,252 units of random donor platelets were found to have bacteria on culture whereas 15 (0.0057%) isolates out of 262,156 units were found from 1 June 2007 to 31 May 2009 (after diversion pouch was introduced). Overall, there was an 85% reduction in bacterial contaminated risk due to skin flora (P < 0.0001) but an increasing trend of detection of non skin flora such as Streptococcus bovis was noted. CONCLUSION: Integration of diversion pouch into blood bags to divert the first 30 mL blood during blood collection on top of the current skin disinfection protocol can significantly reduce the risk of bacterial contamination.
TI  - Efficient and direct identification of fructose fermenting and non-fermenting bacteria from calf gut microbiota using stable isotope probing and modified T-RFLP.
AB  - The aim of this study was the development of an efficient method to identify the  prebiotics-assimilating-bacteria in gut microbiota using DNA-stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) technology. For efficient probing of microbiota with stable isotopes, a small-scale repeated batch culture using a low-carbon-source-containing medium was developed. Fecal samples from cattle were inoculated and [U-(13)C]-fructose was applied to the culture after 24 h stabilization. Organic acid production, pH value of the period and the total diversity of microorganisms of the culture were successfully maintained during the chasing period. DNA samples were extracted from the culture and were subjected to isopycnic centrifugation and fractionation in order to separate fructose fermenters from non-fermenters. T-RFLP (Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism) and the modified T-RFLP of each fraction suggested that Streptococcus bovis was the most dominant fructose fermenter in this culture. In addition, we improved the modified T-RFLP method and successfully identified Lactobacillus vitulinus and Megasphaella eldenii as minor fructose-fermenters and several species of Clostridium cluster IV as non-fermenters. From these results we concluded that the methods shown here provide a means for assessing the importance of individual prebiotics on gut microbiota.
TI  - Genetic and biochemical characterization of an acquired subgroup B3 metallo-beta-lactamase gene, blaAIM-1, and its unique genetic context in Pseudomonas aeruginosa from Australia.
AB  - Three clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (WCH2677, WCH2813, and WCH2837) isolated from the Women's and Children's Hospital, Adelaide, Australia, produced a metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-positive Etest result. All isolates were PCR negative for known MBL genes. A gene bank was created, and an MBL gene, designated bla(AIM-1), was cloned and fully characterized. The encoded enzyme, AIM-1, is a group B3 MBL that has the highest level of identity to THIN-B and L1. It is chromosomal and flanked by two copies (one intact and one truncated) of an ISCR element, ISCR15. Southern hybridization studies indicated the movement of both ISCR15 and bla(AIM-1) within the three different clinical isolates. AIM-1 hydrolyzes most beta-lactams, with the exception of aztreonam and, to a lesser extent, ceftazidime; however, it possesses significantly higher k(cat) values for cefepime and carbapenems than most other MBLs. AIM-1 was the first mobile group B3 enzyme detected and signals further problems for already beleaguered antimicrobial regimes to treat serious P. aeruginosa and other Gram-negative infections.
TI  - Examining the effect of intramammary infections with minor mastitis pathogens on  the acquisition of new intramammary infections with major mastitis pathogens--a systematic review and meta-analysis.
AB  - Major mastitis pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and the coliforms are usually considered more virulent and damaging to the udder than minor mastitis pathogens such as Corynebacterium bovis and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS). The current literature contains several studies detailing analyses with conflicting results as to whether intramammary infection (IMI) with the minor pathogens decreases, increases, or has no effect on the risk of a quarter acquiring a new intramammary infection (NIMI) with a major pathogen. To investigate the available scientific evidence regarding the effect of IMI with minor pathogens on the acquisition of NIMI with major pathogens, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. The total extant English- and French-language literature in electronic databases was searched and all publications cited by relevant papers were investigated. Results from 68 studies were extracted from 38 relevant papers. Random-effects models were used to investigate the effects of CNS and C. bovis on acquisition of new IMI with any of the major pathogens, as well as individually for the minor pathogens and Staph. aureus. Significant heterogeneity among studies exists, some of which could be accounted for by using meta-regression. Overall, observational studies showed no effect, whereas challenge studies showed strong and significant protective effects, specifically when major pathogens were introduced into the mammary gland via methods bypassing the teat end. Underlying risk can account for several unmeasured factors, and studies with higher underlying risk found more protective effects of minor pathogens. Larger doses of challenge organisms reduced the protective effect of minor pathogens, and studies with more stringent diagnostic criteria for pathogen IMI identified less protection. Smaller studies (those utilizing fewer than 40 cows) also showed a greater protective effect than larger studies.

TI  - Toxicity of bovicin HC5 against mammalian cell lines and the role of cholesterol  in bacteriocin activity.
AB  - Bacteriocins are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides produced by Bacteria and some Archaea. The assessment of the toxic potential of antimicrobial peptides is important in order to apply these peptides on an industrial scale. The aim of the present study was to investigate the in vitro cytotoxic and haemolytic potential of bovicin HC5, as well as to determine whether cholesterol influences bacteriocin activity on model membranes. Nisin, for which the mechanism of action is well described, was used as a reference peptide in our assays. The viability of three distinct eukaryotic cell lines treated with bovicin HC5 or nisin was analysed by using the MTT assay and cellular morphological changes were determined by light microscopy. The haemolytic potential was evaluated by using the haemoglobin liberation assay and the role of cholesterol on bacteriocin activity was examined by using model membranes composed of DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and DPoPC (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine). The IC(50) of bovicin HC5 and nisin against Vero cells was 65.42 and 13.48 microM, respectively. When the MTT assay was performed with MCF-7 and HepG2 cells, the IC(50) obtained for bovicin HC5 was 279.39 and 289.30 microM, respectively, while for nisin these values were 105.46 and 112.25 microM. The haemolytic activity of bovicin HC5 against eukaryotic cells was always lower than that determined for nisin. The presence of cholesterol did not influence the activity of either bacteriocin on DOPC model membranes, but nisin showed reduced carboxyfluorescein leakage in DPoPC membranes containing cholesterol. In conclusion, bovicin HC5 only exerted cytotoxic effects at concentrations that were greater than the concentration needed for its biological activity, and the presence of cholesterol did not affect its interaction with model membranes.
TI  - Trial Watch: Experimental Toll-like receptor agonists for cancer therapy.
AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are prototypic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) best known for their ability to activate the innate immune system in response to conserved microbial components such as lipopolysaccharide and double-stranded RNA. Accumulating evidence indicates that the function of TLRs is not restricted to the elicitation of innate immune responses against invading pathogens. TLRs have indeed been shown to participate in tissue repair and injury-induced regeneration as well as in adaptive immune responses against cancer. In particular, TLR4 signaling appears to be required for the efficient processing and cross-presentation of cell-associated tumor antigens by dendritic cells, which de facto underlie optimal therapeutic responses to some anticancer drugs. Thus, TLRs constitute prominent therapeutic targets for the activation/intensification of anticancer immune responses. In line with this notion, long-used preparations such as the Coley toxin (a mixture of killed Streptococcus pyogenes and Serratia marcescens bacteria) and the bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG, an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis originally developed as a vaccine against tuberculosis), both of which have been associated with consistent anticancer responses, potently activate TLR2 and TLR4 signaling. Today, besides BCG, only one TLR agonist is FDA-approved for therapeutic use in cancer patients: imiquimod. In this Trial Watch, we will briefly present the role of TLRs in innate and cognate immunity and discuss the progress of clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of experimental TLR agonists as immunostimulatory agents for oncological indications.
TI  - The relationship between the new taxonomy of Streptococcus bovis and its clonality to colon cancer, endocarditis, and biliary disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The nomenclature of Streptococcus bovis has changed. The study aims were to examine and compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of infections based on the new taxonomy and the genetic relatedness of strains. METHODS: Bacteremic cases from 2004 to 2010 at Assaf Harofeh Medical Center were reviewed. VITEK 2 later confirmed with polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was used for subspecies identification. VITEK 2 later confirmed with Etests was used for minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing. Repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR) was used to determine the genetic relatedness of strains. RESULTS: Twenty-four bacteremia cases were included. The median age of patients was 81 years (range 1 day to 91 years), two were neonates, three were pregnant, and 18 were elderly (>/= 65 years of age). The Charlson's combined conditional age-related score was 8.2 +/- 2.9, and 11 (58 %) patients were immunosuppressed. There were 13 patients who had S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, six had S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, four had S. infantarius subsp. coli, and one had S. infantarius subsp. infantarius. Ten of 19 non-pregnant adult patients had colon adenoma or carcinoma, three had acute biliary disease, and five had endocarditis. Two patients died in the hospital. rep-PCR revealed polyclonality. There were no significant associations between subspecies or genotypes and the various clinical characteristics or outcomes. CONCLUSION: S. bovis bacteremia is a serious disease that affects elderly immunosuppressed individuals. Infection is strongly associated with colon pathology and endocarditis, regardless of the new taxonomy or clone complex. The identification of S. bovis is of paramount importance, and microbiology laboratories should differentiate its processing from that of other S. viridans.
TI  - Effects of an extract of plant flavonoids (Bioflavex) on rumen fermentation and performance in heifers fed high-concentrate diets.
AB  - To study the effects of an extract of plant flavonoids [Bioflavex (FL)] in cattle fed high-concentrate diets, 2 experiments were designed. In the first experiment, the effects of Bioflavex on the development of rumen acidosis was evaluated in 8 Holstein-Friesian crossbreed heifers (451 kg; SEM 14.3 kg of BW) using a crossover design. Each experimental period lasted 22 d; from d 1 to 20, the animals were fed rye grass, on d 21 the animals were fasted, and on d 22, rumen acidosis was induced by applying 5 kg of wheat without [ CONTROL: (CTR) heifers who did not receive Bioflavex] or with flavonoids [heifers who received FL; 300 mg/kg DM] through a rumen cannula. Rumen pH was recorded continuously (from d 19 to d 22). On d 22, average rumen pH was significantly (P < 0.01) higher in the FL animals (6.29; SEM = 0.031) than it was in the CTR heifers (5.98; SEM = 0.029). After the wheat application, the rumen VFA concentration increased (P < 0.01), the proportion of acetic acid decreased (P < 0.01), and lactate concentration (mmol/L) increased, but the increase was not as great (P = 0.09) in the FL as it was in the CTR heifers (0.41 to 1.35 mmol/L; SEM = 0.24). On d 22, Streptococcus bovis and Selenomonas ruminantium titers increased after the wheat application, but Megasphaera elsdenii titers increased (P < 0.05) only in the FL heifers. In the second experiment, the effect of Bioflavex on the performance and rumen fermentation in finishing heifers was evaluated. Forty-eight Fleckvieh heifers (initial BW = 317 kg; SEM = 5.34) were used in a completely randomized design. Heifers were assigned to 1 of 4 blocks based on their BW and, within each block, assigned to 1 of 2 pens (6 heifers/pen). In addition, 16 heifers (2/pen) were rumen cannulated. Individual BW and group consumption of concentrate and straw were recorded weekly until the animals reached the target slaughter weight. Supplementation with FL did not affect ADG, feed consumption, or feed conversion ratio. Rumen pH and molar proportions of propionate were greater (P < 0.01) and acetate proportion was less in the FL (P < 0.01) than they were in the CTR heifers. Flavonoid supplementation might be effective in improving rumen fermentation and reducing the incidence of rumen acidosis. This effect of flavonoids may be partially explained by increasing the numbers of lactate-consuming microorganisms (e.g., M. elsdenii) in the rumen.
TI  - Oral and airway microbiota in HIV-infected pneumonia patients.
AB  - Despite the increased frequency of recurrent pneumonia in HIV-infected patients and recent studies linking the airway bacterial community (microbiota) to acute and chronic respiratory infection, little is known of the oral and airway microbiota that exist in these individuals and their propensity to harbor pathogens despite antimicrobial treatment for acute pneumonia. This pilot study compared paired samples of the oral and airway microbiota from 15 hospitalized HIV-infected patients receiving antimicrobial treatment for acute pneumonia. Total DNA was extracted, bacterial burden was assessed by quantitative PCR, and amplified 16S rRNA was profiled for microbiome composition using a phylogenetic microarray (16S rRNA PhyloChip). Though the bacterial burden of the airway was significantly lower than that of the oral cavity, microbiota in both niches were comparably diverse. However, oral and airway microbiota exhibited niche specificity. Oral microbiota were characterized by significantly increased relative abundance of multiple species associated with the mouth, including members of the Bacteroides, Firmicutes, and TM7 phyla, while airway microbiota were primarily characterized by a relative expansion of the Proteobacteria. Twenty-two taxa were detected in both niches, including Streptococcus bovis and Chryseobacterium species, pathogens associated with HIV-infected populations. In addition, we compared the airway microbiota of five of these patients to those of five non-HIV-infected pneumonia patients from a previous study. Compared to the control population, HIV-infected patients exhibited relative increased abundance of a large number of phylogenetically distinct taxa, which included several known or suspected pathogenic organisms, suggesting that recurrent pneumonia in HIV-infected populations may be related to the presence of these species.
TI  - The increasing incidence of Streptococcus bovis endocarditis and bacteraemia: a case series from 1997 to 2010.
AB  
TI  - The cryptic competence pathway in Streptococcus pyogenes is controlled by a peptide pheromone.
AB  - Horizontal gene transfer is an important means of bacterial evolution that is facilitated by transduction, conjugation, and natural genetic transformation. Transformation occurs after bacterial cells enter a state of competence, where naked DNA is acquired from the extracellular environment. Induction of the competent state relies on signals that activate master regulators, causing the expression of genes involved in DNA uptake, processing, and recombination. All streptococcal species contain the master regulator SigX and SigX-dependent effector genes required for natural genetic transformation; however, not all streptococcal species have been shown to be naturally competent. We recently demonstrated that competence development in Streptococcus mutans requires the type II ComRS quorum-sensing circuit, comprising an Rgg transcriptional activator and a novel peptide pheromone (L. Mashburn-Warren, D. A. Morrison, and M. J. Federle, Mol. Microbiol. 78:589-606, 2010). The type II ComRS system is shared by the pyogenic, mutans, and bovis streptococci, including the clinically relevant pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes. Here, we describe the activation of sigX by a small-peptide pheromone and an Rgg regulator of the type II ComRS class. We confirm previous reports that SigX is functional and able to activate sigX-dependent gene expression within the competence regulon, and that SigX stability is influenced by the cytoplasmic protease ClpP. Genomic analyses of available S. pyogenes genomes revealed the presence of intact genes within the competence regulon. While this is the first report to show natural induction of sigX, S. pyogenes remained nontransformable under laboratory conditions. Using radiolabeled DNA, we demonstrate that transformation is blocked at the stage of DNA uptake.
TI  - Molecular characterization of a novel mosaic tet(S/M) gene encoding tetracycline  resistance in foodborne strains of Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - The presence of antibiotic-resistance (AR) genes in foodborne bacteria of enteric origin represents a relevant threat to human health in the case of opportunistic pathogens, which can reach the human gut through the food chain. Streptococcus bovis is a human opportunistic pathogen often associated with infections in immune-compromised or cancer patients, and it can also be detected in the environment, including fermented foods. We have focused on the molecular characterization of a tetracycline (Tet)-resistance gene present in 39 foodborne isolates of S. bovis phenotypically resistant to this drug. The gene was identified as a novel tet(S/M) fusion, encoding a mosaic protein composed of the N-terminal 33 amino acids of Tet(S), in-frame with the Tet(M) coding sequence. Heterologous expression of the mosaic gene was found to confer Tet resistance upon Escherichia coli recipients. Moreover, the tet(S/M) gene was found to be transcriptionally inducible by Tet under the endogenous tet(S) promoter in both S. bovis and E. coli. Nucleotide sequencing of the surrounding genomic region of 16.2 kb revealed large blocks of homology with the genomes of Streptococcus infantarius and Lactococcus lactis. A subregion of about 4 kb containing mosaic tet(S/M) was flanked by two copies of the IS1216 mobile element. PCR amplification with primers directed outwards from the tet(S/M) gene identified the presence of a 4.3 kb circular form corresponding to the intervening chromosomal region between the two IS1216 elements, but lacking a replication origin. The circular element shared extensive overall homology with a region of the multidrug-resistance plasmid pK214 from Lc. lactis, containing tet(S), as well as the IS1216 transposase-containing element and intervening non-coding sequences. Linear reconstruction of the insertion events likely to have occurred within this genomic region, inferred from sequence homology, provides further evidence of the chromosomal rearrangements that drive genomic evolution in complex bacterial communities such as the gut and food microbiota.
TI  - Effects of hop varieties on ruminal fermentation and bacterial community in an artificial rumen (rusitec).
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a growing interest in the use of hops (Humulus lupulus) as an alternative to antibiotics to manipulate ruminal fermentation. However, the effects of different hop varieties on ruminal fermentation and bacterial populations have not been studied. Here the effects of three hop varieties, Cascade (CAS), Millennium (MIL) and Teamaker (TM), at a level of 800 microg mL(-1) inoculum on ruminal fermentation and microbial populations in an artificial rumen system (rusitec) fed a barley silage-based total mixed ration were investigated. Bacterial populations were assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction and expressed as a percentage of total bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies. RESULTS: All hops reduced (P < 0.001) total gas, methane and the acetate:propionate ratio. Liquid-associated Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus and Streptococcus bovis were reduced (P < 0.05) by MIL and TM. Feed particle-associated S. bovis was reduced (P < 0.01) by MIL and TM, but TM and CAS increased (P < 0.01) Ruminobacter amylophilus and Prevotella bryantii respectively. Methanogens were decreased (P < 0.05) by MIL in both liquid and solid fractions and by CAS in the solid fraction. The total amount of alpha- and beta-acids in hops affected the ruminal fermentation. CONCLUSION: Hop-induced changes in fermentation and microbial populations may improve energy efficiency use in the rumen. Further research is needed to determine the effects of hops on in vivo ruminal fermentation, microbial populations and animal performance.
TI  - Anaerobic bioremediation of RDX by ovine whole rumen fluid and pure culture isolates.
AB  - The ability of ruminal microbes to degrade the explosive compound hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) in ovine whole rumen fluid (WRF) and as 24 bacterial isolates was examined under anaerobic conditions. Compound degradation was monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identification of metabolites. Organisms in WRF microcosms degraded 180 muM RDX within 4 h. Nitroso-intermediates hexahydro-1-nitroso-3,5-dinitro-1,3,5-triazine (MNX), hexahydro-1,3-dinitroso-5-nitro-1,3,5-triazine (DNX), and hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitroso-1,3,5-triazine (TNX) were present as early as 0.25 h and were detected throughout the 24-h incubation period, representing one reductive pathway of ring cleavage. Following reduction to MNX, peaks consistent with m/z 193 and 174 were also produced, which were unstable and resulted in rapid ring cleavage to a common metabolite consistent with an m/z of 149. These represent two additional reductive pathways for RDX degradation in ovine WRF, which have not been previously reported. The 24 ruminal isolates degraded RDX with varying efficiencies (0-96 %) over 120 h. Of the most efficient degraders identified, Clostridium polysaccharolyticum and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans degraded RDX when medium was supplemented with both nitrogen and carbon, while Anaerovibrio lipolyticus, Prevotella ruminicola, and Streptococcus bovis IFO utilized RDX as a sole source of nitrogen. This study showed that organisms in whole rumen fluid, as well as several ruminal isolates, have the ability to degrade RDX in vitro and, for the first time, delineated the metabolic pathway for its biodegradation.
TI  - Interaction with lipid II induces conformational changes in bovicin HC5 structure.
AB  - Bovicin HC5 is a lantibiotic produced by Streptococcus bovis HC5 that targets the cell wall precursor lipid II. An understanding of the modes of action against target bacteria can help broadening the clinical applicability of lantibiotics in human and veterinary medicine. In this study, the interaction of bovicin HC5 with lipid II was examined using tryptophan fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy with model membrane systems that do or do not allow pore formation by bovicin HC5. In the presence of lipid II, a blue-shift of 12 nm could be observed for the fluorescence emission maximum of the tryptophan residue for all of the membrane systems tested. This change in fluorescence emission was paralleled by a decrease in accessibility toward acrylamide and phospholipids carrying a spin-label at the acyl chain; the tryptophan residue of bovicin HC5 was located near the twelfth position of the membrane phospholipid acyl chains. Moreover, the binding of lipid II by bovicin HC5 induced remarkable conformational changes in the bovicin HC5 structure. The interaction of bovicin HC5 with lipid II was highly stable even at pH 2.0. These results indicate that bovicin HC5 interacts directly with lipid II and that the topology of this interaction changes under different conditions, which is relevant for the biological activity of the peptide. To our knowledge, bovicin HC5 is the only bacteriocin described thus far that is able to interact with its target in extreme pH values, and this fact might be related to its unique structure and stability.
TI  - [Endocarditis caused by rare Gram-positive bacteria: investigate for gastrointestinal disorders].
AB  - Gemella haemolysans, Streptococcus equinus and Tropheryma whipplei are rare Gram-positive bacteria which may cause endocarditis and are associated with gastrointestinal disorders. We report on three patients with infective endocarditis caused by these microorganisms. G. haemolysans and S. equinus (Streptococcus bovis group) were isolated from blood cultures, and T. whipplei was diagnosed by molecular typing of an excised heart valve. The association between endocarditis caused by these microorganisms and gastrointestinal disorders warranted further examination. Endoscopic examination revealed a colonic carcinoma in the patient with G. haemolysans endocarditis and diverticulosis in the patient with S. equinus endocarditis. No gastrointestinal tract disorders were found in the patient with T. whipplei endocarditis, but this does not exclude Whipple's disease. Examination of the gastrointestinal tract for a focus of infection should be considered in patients with endocarditis caused by G. haemolysans, S. equinus and T. whipplei if no other source of bacteraemia is apparent.
TI  - Investigating clustering in interval-censored udder quarter infection times in dairy cows using a gamma frailty model.
AB  - Udder infections in dairy cows are observed at udder quarter level. Therefore, the best strategy to study infection dynamics of particular bacteria causing mastitis is to follow up and model individual udder quarter infection times. Udder quarter infection times, however, are not independent as they are clustered within a cow and herds. Another challenge in modelling infection times is that the exact infection time is unknown; it is only known that the infection has taken place in the interval between the last negative and the first positive sample. We applied a technique based on the gamma frailty model which handles the clustering and interval censoring simultaneously. Parameter estimates can be obtained analytically and their variance is obtained by the inverse of the hessian matrix. The proposed technique was applied to udder quarter infection times for Corynebacterium bovis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus uberis. Multiparous cows were more likely to get infected earlier in lactation with C. bovis or S. uberis than primiparous cows. The times to infection of all three bacteria were highly clustered at cow level and the results of a stratified model on a subset of herds suggested a high clustering on herd level for C. bovis and S. uberis.
TI  - Association between bacteremia due to Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (Streptococcus bovis I) and colorectal neoplasia: a case-control study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The association between bacteremia by Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (SGG) and colorectal neoplasia (CRN) is well established but the frequency of the association varies widely in different studies. We conducted a case-control study to assess the association between SGG bacteremia and CRN. METHODS: An analysis of all SGG bacteremias was performed during the period 1988-2011. The frequency of CRN in patients with SGG bacteremia was compared with the frequency of CRN in a symptomatic control group of patients matched at a 1:2 ratio for gender and age (+/-3 years) without S. bovis bacteremia and personal history of CRN and with increased risk of CRN (by the presence of symptoms, signs, or test suspicious of colonic pathology or by family history of CRN). RESULTS: One hundred nine cases of SGG bacteremia were detected (mean age, 66 years; 87% male). Colonoscopy was performed in 98 cases, diagnosing 69 cases of CRN: 57 adenomas (39 advanced adenomas) and 12 invasive carcinomas. Only 4 cases had suspected CRN before the blood culture. The prevalence of CRN was higher in patients with SGG bacteremia than in the 196 control patients (70% vs 32%; odds ratio [OR], 5.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.0-8.6). This difference was not significant when comparing nonadvanced adenomas (19% vs 12%), but we found significant differences in advanced adenomas (40% vs 16%; OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 2.0-6.1) and invasive carcinomas (12% vs 5%; OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.2-6.9). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of CRN among SGG infected patients is significantly increased compared with symptomatic age-matched controls, indicating that SGG infection is a strong indicator for underlying occult malignancy.
TI  - Life-threatening rhabdomyolysis induced by Streptococcus bovis sepsis in a 6-year-old girl presented to the pediatric emergency department.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis infection is an uncommon disease during infancy and childhood. Rhabdomyolysis is frequently a complication of a viral infection in children and typically has a benign course. It has rarely been reported as a complication in cases of bacterial infection, especially those caused by S. bovis. We describe a case of life-threatening rhabdomyolysis after a bacterial infection caused by S. bovis sepsis in a previously healthy 6-year-old girl who presented to our pediatric emergency department. She had an unusually high serum creatine kinase value (peak value, 436,449 IU/L), and she was successfully treated with adequate antibiotic treatment and effective renal replacement therapy. This case illustrates that, although uncommon, S. bovis can cause serious infections during childhood. Pediatric emergency physicians should be aware that uncommon organisms may be able to cause severe infections in susceptible children associated with life-threatening rhabdomyolysis.
TI  - Infective endocarditis due to Streptococcus gallolyticus associated with colonic  displasia.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus is a microorganism belonging to the Streptococcus bovis I group isolated in humans, bovines and equines pigeons, among other animals. Streptococcus bovis is a Streptococcus strain found in the rumen, and has been isolated in the milk of animals with mastitis. The authors describe a case of an adult immunocompetent patient with underlying valvular heart disease, with bacteraemia and infective endocarditis by Streptococcus gallolyticus, in whom adenomatous colonic polyps with dysplasia were identified.
TI  - Catalytic efficiency diversification of duplicate beta-1,3-1,4-glucanases from Neocallimastix patriciarum J11.
AB  - Four types of beta-1,3-1,4 glucanase (beta-glucanase, EC 3.2.1.73) genes, designated bglA13, bglA16, bglA51, and bglM2, were found in the cDNA library of Neocallimastix patriciarum J11. All were highly homologous with each other and demonstrated a close phylogenetic relationship with and a similar codon bias to Streptococcus equinus. The presence of expansion and several predicted secondary structures in the 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of bglA16 and bglM2 suggest that these two genes were duplicated recently, whereas bglA13 and bglA16, which contain very short 3'UTRs, were replicated earlier. These findings indicate that the beta-glucanase genes from N. patriciarum J11 may have arisen by horizontal transfer from the bacterium and subsequent duplication in the rumen fungus. beta-Glucanase genes of Streptococcus equinus, Ruminococcus albus 7, and N. patriciarum J11 were cloned and expressed by Escherichia coli. The recombinant beta-glucanases cloned from S. equinus, R. albus 7, and N. patriciarum J11 were endo-acting and had similar substrate specificity, but they demonstrated different properties in other tests. The specific activities and catalytic efficiency of the bacterial beta-glucanases were also significantly lower than those of the fungal beta-glucanases. Our results also revealed that the activities and some characteristics of enzymes were changed during the horizontal gene transfer event. The specific activities of the fungal beta-glucanases ranged from 26,529 to 41,209 U/mg of protein when barley-derived beta-glucan was used as the substrate. They also demonstrated similar pH and temperature optima, substrate specificity, substrate affinity, and hydrolysis patterns. Nevertheless, BglA16 and BglM2, two recently duplicated beta-glucanases, showed much higher k(cat) values than others. These results support the notion that duplicated beta-glucanase genes, namely, bglA16 and bglM2, increase the reaction efficiency of beta-glucanases and suggest that the catalytic efficiency of beta-glucanase is likely to be a criterion determining the evolutionary fate of duplicate forms in N. patriciarum J11.

TI  - Novel Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius variants harboring lactose metabolism genes homologous to Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius belongs to the Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex (SBSEC) commonly associated with human and animal infections. We elucidated the lactose metabolism of S. infantarius subsp. infantarius predominant in African fermented milk products. S. infantarius subsp. infantarius isolates (n = 192) were identified in 88% of spontaneously fermented camel milk suusac samples (n = 24) from Kenya and Somalia at log(1)(0) 8.2-8.5 CFU mL(-)(1). African S. infantarius isolates excreted stoichiometric amounts of galactose when grown on lactose, exhibiting a metabolism similar to Streptococcus thermophilus and distinct from their type strain. African S. infantarius subsp. infantarius CJ18 harbors a regular gal operon with 99.7-100% sequence identity to S. infantarius subsp. infantarius ATCC BAA-102(T) and a gal-lac operon with 91.7-97.6% sequence identity to S. thermophilus, absent in all sequenced SBSEC strains analyzed. The expression and functionality of lacZ was demonstrated in a beta-galactosidase assay. The gal-lac operon was identified in 100% of investigated S. infantarius isolates (n = 46) from suusac samples and confirmed in Malian fermented cow milk isolates. The African S. infantarius variant potentially evolved through horizontal gene transfer of an S. thermophilus-homologous lactose pathway. Safety assessments are needed to identify any putative health risks of this novel S. infantarius variant.

TI  - Comparison of nitroethane, 2-nitro-1-propanol, lauric acid, Lauricidin(R) and the Hawaiian marine algae, Chaetoceros, for potential broad-spectrum control of anaerobically grown lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The gastrointestinal tract of bovines often contains bacteria that contribute to  disorders of the rumen, and may also contain foodborne or opportunistic human pathogens as well as bacteria capable of causing mastitis in cows. Thus there is a need to develop broad-spectrum therapies that are effective while not leading to unacceptably long antibiotic withdrawal times. The effects of the CH(4)-inhibitors nitroethane (2 mg/mL), 2-nitro-1-propanol (2 mg/mL), lauric acid (5 mg/mL), the commercial product Lauricidin(R) (5 mg/mL), and a finely ground product of the Hawaiian marine algae, Chaetoceros (10 mg/mL), were compared in pure cultures of Streptococcus agalactia, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus bovis, and in a mixed lactic acid rumen bacterial culture. Lauricidin(R) and lauric acid exhibited the most bactericidal acidity against all bacteria. These results suggest potential animal health benefits from supplementing cattle diets with lauric acid or Lauricidin(R) to improve the health of the rumen and help prevent shedding of human pathogens.

TI  - [Diseases associated with bloodstream infections caused by the new species included in the old Streptococcus bovis group].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify possible diseases associated with bloodstream infections caused by new species of S. bovis group isolated in blood cultures and by studying patient records METHODS: Forty-four consecutive blood culture isolates initially designated S. bovis were further characterised using phenotypic methods Patient records were examined. RESULTS: We identified 15 Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, 24 Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, and 5 Streptococcus infantarius isolates in 44 BSI episodes. CONCLUSIONS: The association between S. bovis bacteraemia and endocarditis and/or colon carcinoma is highly dependent on the causative species. Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus is a surrogate for endocarditis and/or bowel disease, whereas Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus is a surrogate for hepato-biliary disease.
TI  - A fibrolytic enzyme additive for lactating Holstein cow diets: ruminal fermentation, rumen microbial populations, and enteric methane emissions.
AB  - The objective was to determine if supplementing a dairy cow diet with an exogenous fibrolytic enzyme additive (Econase RDE; AB Vista, Marlborough, Wiltshire, UK) altered fermentation, pH, and microbial populations in the rumen or enteric methane (CH(4)) emissions. In a companion study, this enzyme additive improved efficiency of fat-corrected milk production in a dose-dependent manner by up to 11% for early lactation dairy cows. Nine ruminally cannulated, lactating Holstein cows were used in a replicated 3 x 3 Latin square design with 21-d periods. Dietary treatments were 0 (control), 0.5 (low), and 1.0 (high) mL of enzyme/kg of total mixed ration dry matter. Rumen contents were collected on 2 d (d 15 and 19), ruminal pH was measured continuously for 6 d (d 13 to 18) by using an indwelling system, and enteric CH(4) production was measured for 3 d (d 16 to 18) using the sulfur hexafluoride tracer gas technique. The enzyme additive did not alter volatile fatty acids, NH(3), pH, or population densities of total protozoa, bacteria, and methanogens in ruminal fluid. However, population densities of certain bacteria, calculated as copy number of species-specific 16S-rRNA, were affected by enzyme treatment. Population density of Ruminobacter amylophilus was increased and that of Fibrobacter succinogenes tended to be increased by the high enzyme treatment. Selenomonas ruminantium tended to increase linearly with increasing levels of enzyme in the diet, although its population density was only numerically increased by the high enzyme treatment. Streptococcus bovis, however, tended to be decreased by the low enzyme treatment. Increasing the level of enzyme supplement in the diet also linearly increased enteric CH(4) production, even when adjusted for feed intake or milk production (19.3, 20.8, and 21.7 g of CH(4)/kg of dry matter intake or 12.9, 13.6, and 15.1g of CH(4)/kg of milk for the control, low, and high enzyme treatments, respectively). This shift in ruminal bacterial communities and higher CH(4) emissions could imply increased ruminal digestion of feed, which needs to be substantiated in longer term studies.

TI  - The role of lactoferrin binding protein B in mediating protection against human lactoferricin.
AB  - Bacteria that inhabit the mucosal surfaces of the respiratory and genitourinary tracts of mammals encounter an iron-deficient environment because of iron sequestration by the host iron-binding proteins transferrin and lactoferrin. Lactoferrin is also present in high concentrations at sites of inflammation where the cationic, antimicrobial peptide lactoferricin is produced by proteolysis of lactoferrin. Several Gram-negative pathogens express a lactoferrin receptor that enables the bacteria to use lactoferrin as an iron source. The receptor is composed of an integral membrane protein, lactoferrin binding protein A (LbpA), and a membrane-bound lipoprotein, lactoferrin binding protein B (LbpB). LbpA is essential for growth with lactoferrin as the sole iron source, whereas the role of LbpB in iron acquisition is not yet known. In this study, we demonstrate that LbpB from 2 different species is capable of providing protection against the killing activity of a human lactoferrin-derived peptide. We investigated the prevalence of lactoferrin receptors in bacteria and examined their sequence diversity. We propose that the protection against the cationic antimicrobial human lactoferrin-derived peptide is associated with clusters of negatively charged amino acids in the C-terminal lobe of LbpB that is a common feature of this protein.
TI  - Correlation between composition of the bacterial community and concentration of volatile fatty acids in the rumen during the transition period and ketosis in dairy cows.
AB  - The transition period is a severe challenge to dairy cows. Glucose supply cannot  meet demand and body fat is mobilized, potentially leading to negative energy balance (NEB), ketosis, or fatty liver. Propionate produces glucose by gluconeogenesis, which depends heavily on the number and species of microbes. In the present study, we analyzed the rumen microbiome composition of cows in the transition period, cows with ketosis, and nonperinatal cows by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) analysis of 16S rRNA genes and quantitative PCR. TRFLP analysis indicated that the quantity of Veillonellaceae organisms was reduced and that of Streptococcaceae organisms was increased in rumen samples from the transition period and ketosis groups, with the number of Lactobacillaceae organisms increased after calving. Quantitative PCR data suggested that the numbers of the main propionate-producing microbes, Megasphaera elsdenii and Selenomonas ruminantium, were decreased, while numbers of the main lactate-producing bacterium, Streptococcus bovis, were increased in the rumen of cows from the transition period and ketosis groups, with the number of Lactobacillus sp. organisms increased after calving. Volatile fatty acid (VFA) and glucose concentrations were decreased, but the lactic acid concentration was increased, in rumen samples from the transition period and ketosis groups. Our results indicate that the VFA concentration is significantly related to the numbers of Selenomonas ruminantium and Megasphaera elsdenii organisms in the rumen.

TI  - Effects of a combination of hinokitiol (beta-thujaplicin) and an organic acid mixture on ruminal fermentation in heifers fed a high-grain diet.
AB  - This study evaluated the effects of hinokitiol (a natural antibacterial compound  extracted from Thujopsis dolabrata var. hondai) and an organic acid mixture (citrate content 50%) on ruminal fermentation. Antibacterial properties were examined by measuring minimal inhibitory concentration. Hinokitiol at 1.56microg/mL or an organic acid mixture at 1600microg/mL inhibited Streptococcus bovis growth. The combination of 0.78microg/mL hinokitiol and 200microg/mL of an organic acid mixture also inhibited S. bovis growth. Both hinokitiol and the hinokitiol and an organic acid mixture combination showed strong antibacterial properties on Gram-positive bacteria such as S. bovis, but relatively weak antibacterial activities on Gram-negative bacteria such as Megasphaera elsdenii. Three ruminally cannulated heifers were fed a bloat-producing diet containing barley, pelleted alfalfa meal, soybean meal and salt without long-cut roughage to investigate the ruminal characteristics in vivo. Feeding to heifers a bloat-producing diet containing 7.8mg/kg hinokitiol and 0.2% of an organic acid mixture significantly decreased the increase in stable ingesta volume. Hinokitiol or an organic acid mixture did not affect ruminal volatile fatty acids, protozoa and bacteria. These results suggest that a combination of hinokitiol and an organic acid mixture might reduce frothy bloat in cattle fed high-grain diets.

AB  - A 75-year-old woman presented to the Tropical Diseases Hospital, Goiania, Brazil, with a two-day history of fever and chills followed by headache and vomiting over the last 24 hours. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed 270 leukocytes/mmc (30 percent neutrophils); 20 red cells/mmc; undetectable levels of glucose and 232 mg/dL of protein. The Gram stain revealed several Gram-positive cocci, and CSF culture yielded Streptococcus bovis. A colonoscopy showed diverticula in descendent and transverse colon. After a 14-day course of penicillin G, the patient was discharged in a good state of health, with only mild hearing impairment.
TI  - No need to search for the source of haematogenous arthroplasty infections.
AB  - QUESTIONS UNDER STUDY/PRINCIPLES: Prosthetic joint infections (PJI) may be a potential sentinel event for an unknown neoplastic or infectious source in elderly patients. However, the value and cost-effectiveness of investigations to determine the origin of these infections is unknown. METHODS: Retrospective study at Geneva University Hospitals, evaluating associated medical examinations performed in search of the origin of all presumed surgical site and haematogenous arthroplasty infections. RESULTS: A total of 182 PJI were found in 182 patients (median age 75 years). Seventy PJI (38%) were classified as probably haematogenous, occurring more than 2 years post-implantation, with 27 (15%) due to Gram-negative pathogens. Overall, the origin of PJI was found solely by admission history in 28 cases (15%). Among the remaining 154 cases, no remote origin could be detected despite 17 echocardiograms, 17 other sonograms, 49 chest x-rays, 23 computed tomograms, 107 urinary cultures, 11 endoscopies, 9 scintigraphies and 31 medical specialist consultations. The average cost of these exams was 675 Swiss francs (845 US$) per PJI. At long-term follow-up six patients were found to have developed a neoplasm, of which only one (hepatocellular carcinoma after PJI due to Streptococcus bovis) could eventually be attributed to prior infection. CONCLUSIONS: From an epidemiologic point of view, patient history is the best way to predict the origin of PJI. Blind additional radiographic or endoscopic exams are costly, inconclusive and do not contribute to the management of these cases.
TI  - Telemedicine can help to ensure that patients receive timely medical care.
AB  - We describe a case illustrating that telephone consultations can help to lower the psychological threshold for accessing medical care in people who are not aware of the seriousness of their symptoms, or who might otherwise be reluctant to access face-to-face care. A 69-year-old male patient called a teleconsultation service at the weekend because of acute fever. The patient was scheduled to have a hip replacement and the usual pre-operative check-up done the day before had been normal. However, a careful medical history taken during the teleconsultation revealed potentially serious symptoms. We therefore referred the patient to the emergency room immediately with the suspicion of severe infection, possibly due to colon cancer. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with septicaemia and adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid. This demonstrates that teleconsultation is not only a powerful tool for triage and diagnosis, but can also help to reduce delay in diagnosing severe diseases in primary health care.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of sphingoid bases and fatty acids against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - There is growing evidence that the role of lipids in innate immunity is more important than previously realized. How lipids interact with bacteria to achieve a level of protection, however, is still poorly understood. To begin to address the mechanisms of antibacterial activity, we determined MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of lipids common to the skin and oral cavity--the sphingoid bases D-sphingosine, phytosphingosine, and dihydrosphingosine and the fatty acids sapienic acid and lauric acid--against four Gram-negative bacteria and seven Gram-positive bacteria. Exact Kruskal-Wallis tests of these values showed differences among lipid treatments (P < 0.0001) for each bacterial species except Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. D-sphingosine (MBC range, 0.3 to 19.6 mug/ml), dihydrosphingosine (MBC range, 0.6 to 39.1 mug/ml), and phytosphingosine (MBC range, 3.3 to 62.5 mug/ml) were active against all bacteria except S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa (MBC > 500 mug/ml). Sapienic acid (MBC range, 31.3 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mitis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum but not active against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa, Corynebacterium bovis, Corynebacterium striatum, and Corynebacterium jeikeium (MBC > 500 mug/ml). Lauric acid (MBC range, 6.8 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against all bacteria except E. coli, S. marcescens, and P. aeruginosa (MBC > 500 mug/ml). Complete killing was achieved as early as 0.5 h for some lipids but took as long as 24 h for others. Hence, sphingoid bases and fatty acids have different antibacterial activities and may have potential for prophylactic or therapeutic intervention in infection.
TI  - Significant Association of Streptococcus bovis with Malignant Gastrointestinal Diseases.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis is a Gram-positive bacterium causing serious human infections, including endocarditis and bacteremia, and is usually associated with underlying disease. The aims of the current study were to compare prevalence of the bacterium associated with malignant and nonmalignant gastrointestinal diseases and to determine the susceptibility of the isolated strains to different antimicrobial agents. The result showed that the prevalence of S. bovis in stool specimens from patients with malignant or with nonmalignant gastrointestinal diseases was statistically significant. This result may support the idea that there is correlation between S. bovis and the malignant gastrointestinal diseases.
TI  - Survey of marbofloxacin susceptibility of bacteria isolated from cattle with respiratory disease and mastitis in Europe.
AB  - A monitoring programme conducted in Europe since 1994 to survey the marbofloxacin susceptibility of bacterial pathogens isolated from cattle has established the susceptibility of bacterial strains isolated before any antibiotic treatment from bovine mastitis and bovine respiratory disease (BRD) cases between 2002 and 2008. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by a standardised microdilution technique. For respiratory pathogens, Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica isolates (751 and 514 strains, respectively) were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (MIC</=0.03 microg/ml for 77.39 per cent of the strains) and only 1.75 per cent of M haemolytica strains were resistant (MIC>/=4 microg/ml). Histophilus somni isolates (73 strains) were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (0.008 to 0.06 microg/ml). Mycoplasma bovis MIC (171 strains) ranged from 0.5 to 4 microg/ml. For mastitis pathogens, the majority of Escherichia coli isolates were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (95.8 per cent of 617 strains). Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (568 and 280 strains) had a homogenous population with MIC centred on 0.25 microg/ml. Streptococcus uberis and Streptococcus dysgalactiae (660 and 217 strains) were moderately susceptible with MIC centred on 1 microg/ml. Marbofloxacin MIC for these various pathogens appeared stable over the seven years of the monitoring programme and was similar to previously published MIC results.
TI  - A novel multiplex PCR/RFLP assay for the identification of Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex members from dairy microbial communities based on the 16S rRNA gene.
AB  - The Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex (SBSEC) comprises pathogenic species associated with different degrees with human infections but also spontaneously fermented dairy products. We aimed therefore at developing a specific identification assay for the SBSEC targeting the 16S rRNA gene comprising a multiplex PCR followed by a differentiating restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP). The multiplex PCR assay was positively applied on 200 SBSEC isolates including reference strains. The assay did not yield false-positive amplifications with strains of closely related bacteria and isolates of non-SBSEC streptococci, lactococci, enterococci, and other genera of dairy origin. The downstream RFLP using MseI and XbaI enabled further discrimination of Streptococcus infantarius/S. bovis (biotype II.1) from Streptococcus gallolyticus (biotype I and II.2)/Streptococcus alactolyticus and S. equinus. Furthermore, the newly developed primers can be used directly for Sanger sequencing. Conclusively, this novel PCR/RFLP assay is applicable in the complex dairy microbial communities and provides an important tool to assess the prevalence of members of the SBSEC in dairy products.
TI  - Cow teat skin, a potential source of diverse microbial populations for cheese production.
AB  - The diversity of the microbial community on cow teat skin was evaluated using a culture-dependent method based on the use of different dairy-specific media, followed by the identification of isolates by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. This was combined with a direct molecular approach by cloning and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. This study highlighted the large diversity of the bacterial community that may be found on teat skin, where 79.8% of clones corresponded to various unidentified species as well as 66 identified species, mainly belonging to those commonly found in raw milk (Enterococcus, Pediococcus, Enterobacter, Pantoea, Aerococcus, and Staphylococcus). Several of them, such as nonstarter lactic acid bacteria (NSLAB), Staphylococcus, and Actinobacteria, may contribute to the development of the sensory characteristics of cheese during ripening. Therefore, teat skin could be an interesting source or vector of biodiversity for milk. Variations of microbial counts and diversity between the farms studied have been observed. Moreover, Staphylococcus auricularis, Staphylococcus devriesei, Staphylococcus arlettae, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus equinus, Clavibacter michiganensis, Coprococcus catus, or Arthrobacter gandavensis commensal bacteria of teat skin and teat canal, as well as human skin, are not common in milk, suggesting that there is a breakdown of microbial flow from animal to milk. It would then be interesting to thoroughly study this microbial flow from teat to milk.
TI  - A longitudinal case series description of meningitis due to Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus in infants.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, previously known as Streptococcus bovis biotype II.2, is known to cause multiple infectious complications, including bacterial meningitis, in adults. Only sporadic individual case reports have identified this pathogen as a cause of meningitis in infants. This study is the first to longitudinally document S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus as a cause of meningitis in four epidemiologically unrelated infants less than 2 weeks of age. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of all 4 isolates were identical, and further were identical to 3 central nervous system (CNS) strains (two adults and one child) reported in existing literature. S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus is an increasingly recognized cause of meningitis and bacteremia in the newborn period, and it merits further study with respect to etiology of infection.

TI  - Selective antibody response to Streptococcus gallolyticus pilus proteins in colorectal cancer patients.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (previously called Streptococcus bovis biotype I) infections have long been associated with colorectal cancer (CRC). This work aimed to investigate the CRC-associated humoral immune response to four pilus proteins of this bacterium by newly developed ELISAs. Pilus proteins are interesting diagnostic targets as they are the building blocks of pilin-like structures that mediate bacterial virulence and are readily exposed to the host immune system upon infection. The presence of serum antibodies against these pilus proteins was evaluated in Dutch and American populations. These analyses showed that an immune response to these antigens was specific for clinical S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus infections, but that increased serum antibody titers to multiple pilus proteins in single individuals were rarely observed. However, a multiplex approach based on antibody titers against any of these four antigens resulted in assay sensitivities between 16% and 43% for the detection of early-stage CRC. Together these findings underscore the potential of a multi-antigen approach to complement diagnosis of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus-associated CRC.

TI  - Clinical Importance of Streptococcus gallolyticus infection among colorectal cancer patients: systematic review and meta-analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus bovis has long been associated with colorectal cancer (CRC). However, not all genospecies are as closely related to CRC. With this systematic review, we aim to increase the awareness of the association between S. bovis biotype I (Streptococcus gallolyticus) and CRC and urge for uniform molecular microbiological classification. METHODS: In January 2011, the PubMed database was searched for all studies that investigated the association between S. bovis, infective endocarditis (IE), and CRC. A total of 191 studies were screened for eligibility and yielded 52 case reports and 31 case series, of which 11 were used for meta-analysis on the association between S. bovis biotype, IE, and adenomas/carcinomas (CRC). RESULTS: Among the S. bovis-infected patients who underwent colonic evaluation, the median percentage of patients who had concomitant adenomas/carcinomas was 60% (interquartile range, 22%), which largely exceeds the disease rate reported in the general asymptomatic population. Meta-analysis showed that patients with S. bovis biotype I infection had a strongly increased risk of having CRC (pooled odds ratio [OR], 7.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.94-13.36) and IE (pooled OR, 16.61; 95% CI, 8.85-31.16), compared with S. bovis biotype II-infected patients. Notably, CRC occurred more often among patients with S. bovis IE than among patients with S. bovis infection at other sites (pooled OR, 3.72; 95% CI, 2.03-6.81). CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis clearly indicates that S. bovis should no longer be regarded as a single species in clinical practice, because S. gallolyticus (S. bovis biotype I) infection, in particular, has an unambiguous association with CRC.
TI  - Septic arthritis due to Streptococcus bovis in a patient with liver cirrhosis due to hepatitis C virus: case report and literature review.
AB  - Monoarthritis remains a diagnostic challenge in Rheumatology and Orthopedics. The author reports a case of septic arthritis due to Streptococcus bovis after several episodes of joint effusion treated with hyaluronic acid (Hylan G-F 20) and methylprednisolone acetate in a 69-year-old patient with liver cirrhosis due to hepatitis C virus. Neither adenoma of the colon nor endocarditis was present. The diagnostic possibilities for this case of monoarthritis, the pathologies related to the microorganism of interest to the rheumatologist, and the possible involvement of joint reaction to hyaluronic acid as a predisposing factor to joint effusion are discussed.
TI  - Rapid identification of bovine mastitis pathogens by high-resolution melt analysis of 16S rDNA sequences.
AB  - Accurate identification of mastitis pathogens is often compromised when using conventional culture-based methods. Here, we report a novel, rapid assay tested for speciation of bacterial mastitis pathogens using high-resolution melt analysis (HRMA) of 16S rDNA sequences. Real-time PCR amplification of 16S rRNA gene fragment, spanning the variable region V5 and V6 was performed with a resulting amplicon of 290bp. First, a library was generated of melt curves of 9 common pathogens that are implicated in bovine mastitis. Six of the isolates, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus and Mycoplasma bovis, were type strains while the other 3, Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Corynebacterium bovis and Streptococcus dysgalactiae, were bovine mastitis field isolates. Four of the type strains, E. coli, S. agalactiae, K. pneumoniae and S. aureus, were found to be of human origin, while the other 3 type strains were isolated from bovine infections. Secondly, the melt curves and corresponding amplicon sequences of A. pyogenes, E. coli, S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae, K. pneumoniae, S. uberis and S. aureus were compared with 10 bovine mastitis field isolates of each pathogen. Based on the distinct differences in melt curves and sequences between human and bovine isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae, it was deemed necessary to select a set of bovine strains for these pathogens to be used as reference strains in the HRMA. Next, the HRMA was validated by three interpreters analyzing the differential clustering pattern of melt curves of 60 bacterial cultures obtained from mastitis milk samples. The three test interpreters were blinded to the culture and sequencing results of the isolates. Overall accuracy of the validation assay was 95% as there was difficulty in identifying the streptococci due to heterogeneity observed in the PCR amplicons of S. uberis. The present study revealed that broad-range real-time PCR with HRMA can be used as a powerful, fast and low-cost tool for the differentiation of clinically important bacterial mastitis pathogens.
TI  - The effect of recurrent episodes of clinical mastitis caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and other organisms on mortality and culling in Holstein dairy cows.
AB  - The objective of this study was to estimate the effects of recurrent episodes of  different types of clinical mastitis (CM) caused by gram-positive (Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus spp.) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas) bacteria, and other organisms (Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Mycoplasma, Corynebacterium bovis, yeast, miscellaneous) on the probability of mortality and culling in Holstein dairy cows. Data from 30,233 lactations in cows of 7 dairy farms in New York State were analyzed. Cows were followed for the first 10 mo in lactation, or until death or culling occurred, or until the end of our study period. Generalized linear mixed models with a Poisson error distribution were used to study the effects of recurrent cases of the different types of CM and several other factors (herd, parity, month of lactation, current year and season, profitability, net replacement cost, other diseases) on cows' probability of death (model 1) or being culled (model 2). Primiparous and multiparous cows were modeled separately because they had different risks of mortality and culling and potentially different CM effects on mortality and culling. Approximately 30% of multiparous cows had at least one case of CM in lactation compared with 16.6% of primiparous cows. Multipara also had higher lactational incidence risks of second (10.7%) and third (4.4%) cases than primipara (3.7% and 1.1%, respectively). For primipara, CM increased the probability of death, with each successive case occurring in a month being increasingly lethal. In multipara, gram-negative CM increased the probability of death, especially when the gram-negative case was the first or second CM case in lactation. Primiparous cows with CM were more likely to be culled after CM than if they did not have CM, particularly after a second or third case. In multipara, any type of CM increased the probability of being culled. Gram-negative CM cases were associated with the numerically highest risk of culling.

TI  - Infected aneurysm of brachial artery after mitral valve infective endocarditis.
AB  - We present a case of brachial artery infected aneurysm in a patient with infective endocarditis caused by Streptococcus bovis. A 49-year-old man presented with fever dyspnea and a pansystolic murmur with irradiation to axilla. The echocardiogram revealed vegetation in native mitral valve. After mitral valve replacement with bioprosthesis, it was observed pulsatile mass of five centimeters in diameter at antecubital fossa of right upper limb. It was made the diagnosis of infected aneurysm of the brachial artery, and the surgery was performed successfully. The aim of this case report is to show a rare complication after infective endocarditis.
TI  - Role of lipid II and membrane thickness in the mechanism of action of the lantibiotic bovicin HC5.
AB  - Lantibiotics are antimicrobial peptides produced by Gram-positive bacteria, nisin being the most well-known member. Nisin inhibits peptidoglycan synthesis and forms pores at sensitive membranes upon interaction with lipid II, the essential bacterial cell wall precursor. Bovicin HC5, a bacteriocin produced by Streptococcus bovis HC5, has the putative N-terminal lipid II binding motif, and we investigated the mode of action of bovicin HC5 using both living bacteria and model membranes, with special emphasis on the role of lipid II. Bovicin HC5 showed activity against Staphylococcus cohnii and Staphylococcus warneri, but bovicin HC5 hardly interfered with the membrane potential of S. cohnii. In model membranes, bovicin HC5 was not able to cause carboxyfluorescein release or proton influx from DOPC vesicles containing lipid II. Bovicin HC5 blocked lipid II-dependent pore formation activity of nisin, and a high-affinity interaction with lipid II was observed (apparent binding constant [K(a)] = 3.1 x 10(6) M(-1)), with a 1:1 stoichiometry. In DOPC vesicles containing lipid II, bovicin HC5 was able to assemble with lipid II into a prepore-like structure. Furthermore, we observed pore formation activity of bovicin HC5, which was stimulated by the presence of lipid II, in thin membranes. Moreover, bovicin HC5 induced the segregation of lipid II into domains in giant model membrane vesicles. In conclusion, bovicin HC5 has a primary mode of action similar to that of nisin, but some differences regarding the pore-forming capacity were demonstrated.
TI  - Streptococcus gallolyticus prosthetic joint infection associated with undiagnosed colonic malignancy.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus is a group D streptococcus which was previously classified as part of the S. bovis/S. equinus complex. It is a rare pathogen in prosthetic joint infection but has been demonstrated to have a strong association with colorectal carcinoma. In this case, a patient with no symptomatology suggestive of colorectal carcinoma presented with a S. gallolyticus prosthetic joint infection. Awareness of the association prompted investigation and subsequent diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma which was successfully treated prior to two-stage revision knee replacement. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: V.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis peritonitis complicating peritoneal dialysis--a review of 10  years' experience.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: An association of Streptococcus bovis bacteremia with carcinoma of colon has been reported, but data regarding peritoneal dialysis (PD) peritonitis caused by S. bovis is scarce. In this study, we examined the clinical characteristics, associations, and outcomes of this disease entity. METHODS: The case records of patients with S. bovis PD peritonitis presenting to 2 renal centers between January 2000 and September 2010 were reviewed. Clinical features and outcomes were identified and analyzed. RESULTS: Of cultures from 23 episodes of S. bovis peritonitis in 20 patients (1.28% of all peritonitis episodes at our center), 19 (82.6%) showed S. bovis alone, and 4 (17.4%) showed mixed growth. In 7 episodes, the S. bovis was moderately resistant to penicillin G. Rates of resistance to clindamycin and erythromycin were 43.5% and 47.8% respectively. In 18 episodes (78.3%), a primary response was achieved with a first-generation cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside. In 4 episodes, a secondary response was achieved after a switch from cephalosporin to vancomycin, and in 1 episode with mixed growth, the Tenckhoff catheter had to be removed. Repeat peritonitis occurred in 3 patients at a mean of 50.0 months (range: 24.2 - 83.1 months). Of the 20 patients of S. bovis peritonitis, 10 (50%) underwent either a barium enema or a colonoscopy. One patient had history of colonic carcinoma 2 years before the peritonitis, and a subsequent work-up revealed no recurrence. Three patients had diverticulosis, and one had a concomitant sigmoid polyp. Findings in the other 6 patients were normal. No colorectal malignancy had developed in the remaining 10 patients after a mean follow-up of 76.6 months (range: 0.8 - 125.1 months). CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes in S. bovis PD peritonitis were favorable, and an association with colorectal cancer was not found in our patients. Routine colonoscopy in these patients remains controversial and should be individualized.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of daptomycin tested against gram-positive strains collected in European hospitals: results from 7 years of resistance surveillance (2003-2009).
AB  - Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide approved by the European medicines Agency (EMEA) for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI) and Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis. We evaluated the in vitro activity of daptomycin and comparators tested against clinical isolates from european hospitals over a 7-year period (2003-2009). A total of 36,769 consecutive isolates were collected in 34 medical centers located in 13 European countries, Turkey and Israel. the collection included S. aureus (18,352; 27.2% oxacillin-resistant [MRSA]); coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 6,874), Enterococcus spp. (7,241; 9.4% vancomycin-resistant), beta-hemolytic (3,009), viridans group streptococci (1,176), and Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus (107). The organisms were isolated mainly from patients with bloodstream infection (56%) or cSSTI (23%). Daptomycin was very active against S. aureus and CoNS (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/l for both organisms), and its activity was not adversely influenced by oxacillin resistance. All Enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to daptomycin (MIC(50/90), 1/1 mg/l). Daptomycin (MIC(50/90), 2/2 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) and linezolid (MIC(50/90), 1/2 mg/l; 99.7% susceptible) were the most active agents tested against vancomycin-resistant E. faecium. Vancomycin- resistant and -susceptible enterococcal strains were equally susceptible to daptomycin. Daptomycin was also active against beta-hemolytic streptococci (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.25 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible), viridans group streptococci (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/l; 99.8% susceptible) and S. bovis (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.12 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible).In summary, daptomycin was very potent against this large collection (36,769) of Gram-positive organisms isolated in european hospitals, and its activity remained stable across the 7-year period evaluated (2003-2009), using reference methods and interpretive criteria. Decreases in daptomycin potency were not observed since EMEA approval and widespread clinical use, and emerging resistance to other compounds did not adversely influence daptomycin activity against contemporary Gram-positive species.
TI  - Reidentification of Streptococcus bovis isolates causing bacteremia according to  the new taxonomy criteria: still an issue?
AB  - All Streptococcus bovis blood culture isolates recovered from January 2003 to January 2010 (n = 52) at the Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal were reidentified on the basis of their genetic traits using new taxonomic criteria. Initial identification was performed by the semiautomatic Wider system (Fco. Soria-Melguizo, Spain) and the API 20 Strep system (bioMerieux, France). All isolates were reidentified by PCR amplification and sequencing of both the 16S rRNA and sodA genes and by mass spectrometry using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS; Bruker, Germany). Results of 16S rRNA/sodA gene sequencing were as follows: Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, 14/14 (number of isolates identified by 16S rRNA/number of isolates identified by sodA gene sequencing); Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, 24/24; Streptococcus spp., 7/0; Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius, 0/2; Streptococcus lutetiensis, 0/5; Leuconostoc mesenteroides, 4/0; and Lactococcus lactis, 3/3. MALDI-TOF MS identified 27 S. gallolyticus isolates but not at the subspecies level, 4 L. mesenteroides isolates, 3 L. lactis isolates, and 6 S. lutetiensis isolates, whereas 12 isolates rendered a nonreliable identification result. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis grouped all S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus isolates into 3 major clusters clearly different from those of the S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus isolates, which, in turn, exhibited no clonal relationship. The percentages of resistance to the tested antimicrobials were 38% for erythromycin, 23% for fosfomycin, 10% for levofloxacin, 6% for tetracycline, and 4% for co-trimoxazole. The most frequent underlying diseases were hepatobiliary disorders (53%), endocarditis (17%), and malignancies (12%). We conclude that sequencing of the sodA gene was the most discriminatory method and that S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus appears to have a higher genetic diversity than S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus.
TI  - Two weeks of postsurgical therapy may be enough for high-risk cases of endocarditis caused by Streptococcus viridans or Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - The duration of antimicrobial therapy after surgery for infective endocarditis (IE) is controversial. A short course of postsurgical therapy is currently accepted only for patients with negative valve culture. We performed a retrospective (1994-2008) analysis of patients who underwent surgery for IE in our hospital and had a high risk of complications ( one of more of the following: <2 weeks of antibiotic treatment before surgery; embolism; perivalvular extension; and positive valve culture) to compare outcomes of patients who received short-course antimicrobial therapy (SAT) (median 15 days) or long-course antimicrobial therapy (LAT) (median 32 days), irrespective of the results of valve culture. Our endpoints included length of hospital stay, renal and hepatic failure, relapse, re-infection, and mortality rates 1 year after surgery. During the study period, 140 patients underwent surgery for IE (valve replacement, 87.9%). Of these, 133 fulfilled the high-risk group criteria and 92 completed the antimicrobial schedule. Comparison of patients receiving SAT (37) and LAT (55) showed that the SAT group had a shorter length of hospital stay (29 vs. 40 days, p 0.01), and a trend towards lower frequency of renal failure (5.4% vs. 18.2%, p 0.11) and hepatic failure (5.4% vs. 9.1%, p 0.69), whereas mortality (5.4% vs. 3.6%, p 1), relapse (0% vs. 1.8%, p 1) and re-infection (5.4% vs. 3.6%, p 1) rates were similar between both groups. Multivariate analysis showed that IE caused by Streptococcus viridans or Streptococcus bovis was independently associated with SAT. Postsurgical SAT is safe, especially when IE is caused by Streptococcus viridans or Streptococcus bovis, even in patients at high risk of complications.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy for infective endocarditis: a ten-year prospective study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The length of treatment of infective endocarditis (IE) with parenteral antibiotics varies from 2 to 6 weeks. Although several studies indicate that outpatient parenteral antibiotic treatment (OPAT) could be safe for uncomplicated viridans-group streptococci (VGS) IE, the experience in Spain is limited and data on other types of endocarditis and OPAT are scarce worldwide. METHODS: Prospective single center study of a cohort including all patients with IE admitted to the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona OPAT program from January 1997 to December 2006. RESULTS: During the study period, 392 consecutive episodes of IE in non-drug abusers were attended to. Of these, 73 episodes (42 native-valve, 23 prosthetic-valve, and 8 pacemaker-lead) were admitted to the OPAT program (19%). The percentage of inclusion was higher for viridans group streptococci (VGS) or Streptococcus bovis (S. bovis) IE (32% of all VGS or S. bovis IE episodes diagnosed vs. 14% of the remaining etiologies, P<.001). Twelve patients (16%) were readmitted due to complications, of which 3 died (4%). Glycopeptides use was the only predictor factor of hospital readmission (OR 4.5, 95% confidence interval 1.2; 16.8, P=.026). No differences in OPAT outcome were found between VGS plus S. bovis IE and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) plus coagulase-negative staphylococci IE. Patients spent a median of 17 day on OPAT (interquartile range 11-26.5), which enabled 1,466 days of hospital stay to be saved. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that OPAT for IE may be a safe and effective therapeutic approach in the treatment of selected patients with types of endocarditis other than uncomplicated VGS or S. bovis endocarditis, although patients taking glycopeptides need close clinical OPAT monitoring.

TI  - [Descriptive analysis of diseases associated with Streptococcus bovis bacteremia].
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: It is well-known the relationship between Streptococcus bovis (S. bovis) bacteremia and colon cancer, liver cirrhosis and others neoplasms. However, a study protocol to rule out these underlying diseases has not been carried out yet. Our objective was to describe S. bovis bacteremia and associated diseases. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Multicenter, retrospective cohort study. S. bovis bacteremias episodes between 2001 and 2009 were included. Mean variables: colon neoplasm, non-colonic neoplasm or liver cirrhosis. Epidemiologist aspects, bacteremia related variables, personal and familiar history and clinical and analytical data were collected. RESULTS: Ninety three patients were included. One out of four individuals had a colon neoplasm. Fifty seven per cent were concomitant cases with bacteremia and six cases were diagnosed after bacteremia (time bacteremia-diagnosis of neoplasm [months], median [Q1-Q3], 2.6 [1-11]). Fourteen (15%) patients were diagnosed with any non-colonic neoplasm (mainly biliary and pancreatic [6 cases] or esophagus-gastric [3 cases]). There were three patients (21%) with concomitant bacteremia non-colonic neoplasm and two after it (1.2 and 10.4 months). Twenty-one (23%) patients suffered from liver cirrhosis. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with S. bovis bacteremia must undergo a study designed to rule out underlying diseases. We suggest that this study should include: a colonic evaluation, ideally by colonoscopy, a liver evaluation by serum chemistry, an abdominal ultrasound scan or a method of liver fibrosis assessment, a gastroscopy and an evaluation of biliary and pancreatic areas by magnetic resonance imaging.
TI  - Exploring internal features of 16S rRNA gene for identification of clinically relevant species of the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus is an economically important genus as a number of species belonging to this genus are human and animal pathogens. The genus has been divided into different groups based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. The variability observed among the members of these groups is low and it is difficult to distinguish them. The present study was taken up to explore 16S rRNA gene sequence to develop methods that can be used for preliminary identification and can supplement the existing methods for identification of clinically-relevant isolates of the genus Streptococcus. METHODS: 16S rRNA gene sequences belonging to the isolates of S. dysgalactiae, S. equi, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. bovis, S. gallolyticus, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. mitis, S. pneumoniae, S. thermophilus and S. anginosus were analyzed with the purpose to define genetic variability within each species to generate a phylogenetic framework, to identify species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. RESULTS: The framework based analysis was used to segregate Streptococcus spp. previously identified upto genus level. This segregation was validated using species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. 43 uncharacterized Streptococcus spp. could be identified using this approach. CONCLUSIONS: The markers generated exploring 16S rRNA gene sequences provided useful tool that can be further used for identification of different species of the genus Streptococcus.
TI  - Detection and characterization of pediocin PA-1/AcH like bacteriocin producing lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Fifty-five bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from seven different sources. Eight isolates were found to produce pediocin PA-1 like bacteriocin as detected by pedB gene PCR and dot-blot hybridization. The culture filtrate (CF) activity of these isolates exhibited strong antilisterial, antibacterial activity against tested food-borne pathogens and LAB. The identification and genetic diversity among the selected LAB was performed by conventional morphological and molecular tools like RFLP, RAPD, and 16S rDNA gene sequencing. The isolates were identified as, 1 each of Pediococcus acidilactici Cb1, Lactobacillus plantarum Acr2, and Streptococcus equinus AC1, 2 were of P. pentosaceus Cb4 and R38, and other 3 were Enterococcus faecium Acr4, BL1, V3. Partial characterization of the bacteriocins revealed that the peptide was heat-stable, active at acidic to alkaline pH, inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, and had molecular weight around 4.6 kDa and shared the properties of class IIa pediocin-family. The bacteriocin production at different temperatures, pH, and salt concentrations was studied to investigate the optimal condition for application of these isolates as a starter culture or as a biopreservative in either acidic or non-acidic foods.
TI  - Screening of species-specific lactic acid bacteria for veal calves multi-strain probiotic adjuncts.
AB  - The selection of promising specific species of lactic acid bacteria with potential probiotic characteristics is of particular interest in producing multi species-specific probiotic adjuncts in veal calves rearing. The aim of the present work was to select and evaluate in vitro the functional activity of lactic acid bacteria, Bifidobacterium longum and Bacillus coagulans strains isolated from veal calves in order to assess their potential use as multi species-specific probiotics for veal calves. For this purpose, bacterial strains isolated from faeces collected from 40 healthy 50-day-calves, were identified by RiboPrinter and 16s rRNA gene sequence. The most frequent strains belonged to the species B. longum, Streptococcus bovis, Lactobacillus animalis and Streptococcus macedonicus. Among these, 7 strains were chosen for testing their probiotic characteristics in vitro. Three strains, namely L. animalis SB310, Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei SB137 and B. coagulans SB117 showed varying individual but promising capabilities to survive in the gastrointestinal tract, to adhere, to produce antimicrobial compounds. These three selected species-specific bacteria demonstrated in vitro, both singularly and mixed, the functional properties needed for their use as potential probiotics in veal calves.
TI  - Isolated septic discitis associated with Streptococcus bovis bacteremia.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis is a Gram-positive coccus that can be found in the intestinal flora of healthy people; it is also associated with colon cancer and infective endocarditis. We report on a 79-year-old male who initially presented with acute-onset lower back pain. Streptococcus bovis was detected in repeated blood cultures, and magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine revealed septic discitis of the L2-L3 intervertebral disc. Excision and debridement of the intervertebral disc was performed and a tissue culture tested positive for S. bovis. Repeat echocardiography and colonoscopy showed no signs of vegetation or tumor lesions, respectively. We diagnosed the patient with isolated septic discitis caused by S. bovis-induced bacteremia. The patient was discharged after six weeks of antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis secondary to Streptococcus bovis in a patient with chronic chylous ascites.
AB  - Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a common complication of cirrhosis and ascites, and is predominantly caused by enteric organisms. Streptococcus bovis is a rare etiology of SBP that was first reported in 1994. Since then, few prior reports of SBP secondary to S. bovis have been observed in patients with underlying cirrhosis or hepatitis. We now present a case of SBP caused by S. bovis in the setting of chronic chylous ascites in a patient with no known liver pathology.
TI  - Effects of adding polyclonal antibody preparations on ruminal fermentation patterns and digestibility of cows fed different energy sources.
AB  - Nine ruminally cannulated cows fed different energy sources were used to evaluate an avian-derived polyclonal antibody preparation (PAP-MV) against the specific ruminal bacteria Streptococcus bovis, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Clostridium aminophilum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Clostridium sticklandii and monensin (MON) on ruminal fermentation patterns and in vivo digestibility. The experimental design was three 3 x 3 Latin squares distinguished by the main energy source in the diet [dry-ground corn grain (CG), high-moisture corn silage (HMCS), or citrus pulp (CiPu)]. Inside each Latin square, animals received one of the feed additives per period [none (CON), MON, or PAP-MV]. Dry matter intake and ruminal fermentation variables such as pH, total short-chain fatty acids (tSCFA), which included acetate, propionate, and butyrate, as well as lactic acid and NH(3)-N concentration were analyzed in this trial. Total tract DM apparent digestibility and its fractions were estimated using chromic oxide as an external marker. Each experimental period lasted 21 d. Ruminal fluid sampling was carried out on the last day of the period at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h after the morning meal. Ruminal pH was higher (P = 0.006) 4 h postfeeding in MON and PAP-MV groups when compared with CON. Acetate:propionate ratio was greater in PAP-MV compared with MON across sampling times. Polyclonal antibodies did not alter (P > 0.05) tSCFA, molar proportion of acetate and butyrate, or lactic acid and NH(3)-N concentration. Ruminal pH was higher (P = 0.01), 4 h postfeeding in CiPu diets compared with CG and HMCS. There was no interaction between feed additive and energy source (P > 0.05) for any of the digestibility coefficients analyzed. Starch digestibility was less (P = 0.008) in PAP-MV when compared with CON and MON. In relation to energy sources, NDF digestibility was greater (P = 0.007) in CG and CiPu vs. the HMCS diet. The digestibility of ADF was greater (P = 0.002) in CiPu diets followed by CG and HMCS. Feeding PAP-MV or monensin altered ruminal fermentation patterns and digestive function in cows; however, those changes were independent of the main energy source of the diet.
TI  - Novel clues on the specific association of Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp gallolyticus with colorectal cancer.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp gallolyticus ( Streptococcus bovis biotype I) endocarditis is in general low but very often linked to colorectal cancer. Therefore, this study aimed to reveal the virulence characteristics that distinguish this opportunistic pathogen from a panel of (closely related) intestinal bacteria. METHODS: The route of infection was reconstructed in vitro with adhesion, invasion, and translocation assays on differentiated Caco-2 cells. Furthermore, cellular immune responses upon infection and bacterial biofilm formation were analyzed in a comparative manner. RESULTS: S. gallolyticus subsp gallolyticus strains were demonstrated to have a relative low adhesiveness and could not internalize epithelial cells. However, these bacteria were uniquely able to paracellularly cross a differentiated epithelium without inducing epithelial interleukin 8 or 1beta responses. Importantly, they had an outstanding ability to form biofilms on collagen-rich surfaces, which in vivo are found at damaged heart valves and (pre)cancerous sites with a displaced epithelium. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data show that S. gallolyticus subsp gallolyticus has a unique repertoire of virulence factors that facilitate infection through (pre)malignant colonic lesions and subsequently can provide this bacterium with a competitive advantage in (1) evading the innate immune system and (2) forming resistant vegetations at collagen-rich sites in susceptible patients with colorectal cancer.
TI  - Isolation of Streptococcus bovis from apheresis platelets of asymptomatic donor warranted colonoscopy investigation: case report and literature review.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) products is one of the most serious complications of transfusion. Culturing PLT components may detect the presence of bacteria, thus reducing the risk of a septic result after transfusion. Streptococcus bovis has previously been reported as a contaminating microorganism in PLT products. Here we report an asymptomatic donor diagnosed with occult colon malignancy after positive isolation of S. bovis from his apheresis PLTs (APs). We also review previous cases. CASE REPORT: The PLT donor was a 50-year-old man with more than 150 prior plateletpheresis or whole blood donations. Bacterial culture of his AP components yielded two positive results: group D Streptococcus was isolated in July 2008 and S. bovis was reported in April 2010. The donor received further testing, and colonofibroscopic examination revealed colonic neoplasm. Pathologic examination of the biopsied tissue led to a diagnosis of invasive adenocarcinoma. He underwent a left hemicolectomy in July 2010. Examination of the resection specimen confirmed adenocarcinoma, Stage III with regional lymph node metastatic adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSION: Donated AP products positive for S. bovis should not be presumed to be due to contamination during collection. This bacteremia originating from donor factors needs to be carefully evaluated. Colonofibroscopic examination is recommended for these donors to detect colonic malignancy as early as possible.
TI  - Increased dietary zinc oxide changes the bacterial core and enterobacterial composition in the ileum of piglets.
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the effects of increased dietary ZnO on the bacterial core and enterobacterial composition in the small intestine of piglets that were fed diets containing a total of 124 or 3,042 mg of Zn per kilogram of diet, respectively. Zinc was supplemented to the basal diet as ZnO. Bacterial 16S rRNA genes of ileal DNA extracts were PCR-amplified with 2 bar-coded primer sets and sequenced by 454 pyrosequencing. The bacterial core species were calculated from the relative abundances of reads present in 5 of 6 samples per group and at a minimum of 5 sequences per sample. The reference database SILVA was used to assign sequence reads at an alignment minimum of 200 bases and 100% identity. Lactic acid bacteria dominated the bacterial core, but showed diverse responses to dietary ZnO. Of the dominant Lactobacillus spp., Lactobacillus reuteri was reduced due to increased dietary ZnO (44.7 vs. 17.9%; P=0.042), but L. amylovorus was not influenced. However, the changes of relative abundances of other lactic acid bacteria were more noteworthy; Weissella cibaria (10.7 vs. 23.0%; P=0.006), W. confusa (10.0 vs. 22.4%; P=0.037), Leuconostoc citreum (6.5 vs. 14.8%; P=0.009), Streptococcus equinus (0.14 vs. 1.0%; P=0.044), and S. lutetiensis (0.01 vs. 0.11%; P=0.016) increased in relative abundance. Nonlactic acid bacteria that were influenced by increased dietary ZnO included the strict anaerobic species, Sarcina ventriculi, which showed a strong numerical decrease in relative abundance (14.6 vs. 5.1%). Species of the Enterobacteriaceae increased their relative abundance, as well as species diversity, in the high dietary ZnO experimental group. Bacterial diversity indices were increased due to increased dietary ZnO (P < 0.05), which was traced back to the increase of sequences from subdominant species. Increased dietary ZnO led to an increase of less prominent species and, thus, had a major impact on the bacterial composition and diversity in piglets. This effect may help to stabilize the intestinal microbiota in the sensitive postweaning period.
TI  - Prevalence of colorectal cancer associated with Streptococcus bovis among inflammatory bowel and chronic gastrointestinal tract disease patients.
AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cause of cancer mortality among men and women worldwide; the risk of its occurrence has been shown to be increased by chronic bacterial infections. A case control study was therefore carried out at Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia (HUSM) to determine the incidence of colorectal cancer associated with S. bovis infection. A total of 166 stool specimens were collected from diseased patients and healthy individuals and S. bovis isolates were identified. Suspected colon tumor and cancer cases were diagnosed and confirmed. It was found that overall prevalence of S. bovis was 41 (24.7%) out of 166 cases studied. Some 41(48.6%) of these S. bovis isolates was found in patients with colonic polyps, adenocarcinomas, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and chronic gastrointestinal tract (GIT). It was also found that colorectal cancer incidence was 24.7%, adenocarinomas accounting for 51% with the highest incidence in the sigmoid part of the colon. Among the IBD and chronic GIT cases, ulcerative colitis featured in the majority of cases (41.4%). In conclusion, there is a high incidence of colorectal cancer associated with S. bovis.
TI  - Is it antiphospholipid syndrome?
AB  - The diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis remains a challenge, as nearly half of cases develop in the absence of preexistent heart disease and known risk factors. Not infrequently, a blunted clinical course at onset can lead to erroneous diagnoses. We present the case of a 47-year-old previously healthy man in which a presumptive diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome was made based on the absence of echocardiographically detected heart involvement, a negative blood culture, normal C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, a positive lupus anticoagulant (LAC) test, and evidence of splenic infarcts. The patient eventually developed massive aortic endocarditic involvement, with blood cultures positive for Streptococcus bovis, and was referred for valvular replacement. This case not only reminds us of the diagnostic challenges of bacterial endocarditis, but also underlines the need for a critical application of antiphospholipid syndrome diagnostic criteria.
TI  - Monitoring intestinal microbiota profile: a promising method for the ultraearly detection of colorectal cancer.
AB  - Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers and is very hard to be detected at an ultraearly stage because of lack of valuable predicating methods that often lead to treatment failure. Intestinal microbiota has long been considered to implicate in colorectal cancer pathology; and many recent reports point out a close linkage between the intestinal bacteria and the genesis of the tumor. Present studies indicate that the structure and characteristics of the intestinal microbiota are significantly altered in colorectal cancer, precancerous lesion, and high risk population compared with healthy controls and low risk population. Based on the current studies and theories, we postulate monitoring the intestinal bacterial profile by the molecular methods that could fulfill the ultraearly prediction about the degree of the risk developing into colorectal cancer. Further population-based epidemiological study is useful to reveal the characteristics of the intestinal microbiota in ultraearly colorectal cancer, which might provide some novel prophylactic and therapeutic strategies for the colorectal cancer.
TI  - [Microorganisms and cancer: scientific evidence and new hypotheses].
AB  - Microorganism involvement in cancer has been known for over a century, and different types of parasites, bacteria and viruses have been associated with oncogenic processes. Among the bacteria, the first recognised was Helicobacter pylori which causes gastric cancer and might be related to extra-gastric cancer in humans. Helicobacter hepaticus has been associated with liver cancers using animal models. Other bacteria, such as Chlamydia psitacii, Borrelia burgdorferi and Streptococcus bovis, have been associated with ocular, skin and colorectal cancers, respectively. Also, a commensal bacterium in the human intestine, Bacteroides fragilis, has been linked, very recently, with colorectal cancer using animal models.
TI  - Differentiation of species of the Streptococcus bovis/equinus-complex by MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry in comparison to sodA sequence analyses.
AB  - The Streptococcus bovis/equinus complex is a heterogeneous group within the group D streptococci with important clinical relevance regarding infective endocarditis, sepsis and colon carcinoma. The taxonomic identification of species and sub-species of this complex, by the standard methods remains difficult. In the present study, we compared the cluster analysis of 88 strains of species of the S. bovis/equinus complex by sequence analysis of the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase gene (sodA) and by Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time Of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). We observed a high congruence of strain grouping by MALDI-TOF MS in comparison with sodA sequence analyses, demonstrating the accuracy and reliability of MALDI-TOF MS in comparison to DNA sequence-based method. By generating mass spectra for each species and sub-species, we were able to discriminate all members of the S. bovis/equinus complex. Furthermore, we demonstrated reliable identifications to the species level by MALDI-TOF MS, independently of cultivation conditions.
TI  - The association of Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus with colorectal tumors: the nature and the underlying mechanisms of its etiological role.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis (S. bovis) bacteria are associated with colorectal cancer and adenoma. S. bovis is currently named S. gallolyticus. 25 to 80% of patients with S. bovis/gallolyticus bacteremia have concomitant colorectal tumors. Colonic neoplasia may arise years after the presentation of bacteremia or infectious endocarditis of S. bovis/gallolyticus. The presence of S. bovis/gallolyticus bacteremia and/or endocarditis is also related to the presence of villous or tubular-villous adenomas in the large intestine. In addition, serological relationship of S. gallolyticus with colorectal tumors and direct colonization of S. gallolyticus in tissues of colorectal tumors were found. However, this association is still under controversy and has long been underestimated. Moreover, the etiological versus non-etiological nature of this associationis not settled yet. Therefore, by covering the most of up to date studies, this review attempts to clarify the nature and the core of S. bovis/gallolyicus association with colorectal tumors and analyze the possible underlying mechanisms.
TI  - Acute cholecystitis and bacteraemia due to Streptococcus bovis biotype II.
AB  
TI  - How a bowel tumour led to meningitis.
AB  - This report summarises a case history in which a 75-year-old man was admitted with bacterial meningitis caused by Streptococcus bovis. A subsequent abdominal investigation in the light of the known association between invasive S bovis infection and colonic cancer confirmed the suspicion of a cancer located to the rectum. The patient died from Clostridium difficile enterocolitis with sepsis and multi-organ failure. This is a highly relevant and interesting case presentation, which besides providing a learning point that patients with S bovis infection should undergo investigation for abdominal cancer, describes a 'best practice' pattern in which clinicians followed up on a known association between a rare clinical presentation and underlying disease.
TI  - Getting to the heart of rectal bleeding: subacute bacterial endocarditis presenting as anaemia and a GI bleed.
AB  - In this case report, the authors demonstrate a case of subacute bacterial endocarditis presenting with anaemia. It is the first of its kind to describe a delay in diagnosis due to an initial patient investigation for a bleed rather than a cardiac evaluation. Astute clinicians need to be aware of the causes of anaemia in patients with endocarditis and consider that in Streptococcus bovis (S bovis) infection can be related to gastrointestinal polyps or malignancy resulting in bleeding. Although patients with S bovis endocarditis should undergo full gastrointestinal investigation after endocarditis is diagnosed, it should not delay medical treatment. In this article, the authors discuss the consequences of failing to achieve timely recognition of endocarditis along with common systemic complications. The authors also outline current recommendations for surgical intervention as heart valve replacement surgery was warranted in the patient to prevent fatal outcome.
TI  - Gene cluster for biosynthesis of thermophilin 1277--a lantibiotic produced by Streptococcus thermophilus SBT1277, and heterologous expression of TepI, a novel immunity peptide.
AB  - AIMS: To identify genes cluster for thermophilin 1277 produced by Streptococcus thermophilus SBT1277. METHODS AND RESULTS: To identify genes for thermophilin 1277 production, the chromosomal DNA region surrounding the structural gene, tepA, was sequenced using a primer-walking method. The thermophilin 1277 biosynthesis gene locus (tep) is a 9.9-kb region, which consists of at least ten open reading frames (ORFs) in the following order: tepAMTFEGKRI and ORF4. Homology analysis showed high similarity to genes involved in bovicin HJ50 production by Streptococcus bovis HJ50. tepI encodes a novel, small, positively charged hydrophobic peptide of 52 amino acids, which contains a putative transmembrane segment. By heterologous expression in Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris MG1363, the TepI-expressing strain exhibited at least 1.3 times higher resistance to thermophilin 1277. CONCLUSIONS: Thermophilin 1277 biosynthesis genes were encoded by a 9.9-kbp region containing at least ten ORFs. TepI is a novel immunity peptide, which protected Strep. thermophilus SBT1277 against thermophilin 1277 in addition to TepFEG, a putative ABC transporter. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first report regarding a lantibiotic gene cluster produced by Strep. thermophilus strain.
TI  - Diagnosis of intramammary infection in samples yielding negative results or minor pathogens in conventional bacterial culturing.
AB  - Up to half of quarter milk samples submitted for mastitis diagnosis are culture-negative results or lead to identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci or Corynebacterium bovis in conventional culturing, the so-called minor pathogens. The interpretation and usefulness of these results in terms of udder and animal health management is limited, even though the amount of resources spent is relatively high. This work aimed to test two methods of analysis of milk samples with the goal of increasing detection of intramammary pathogens. In the first study, 783 milk samples were processed in duplicate: before and after freezing at -20 degrees C for 24 h, using standard bacteriological techniques. There was a significant difference between the two methods with samples frozen for 24 h yielding significantly fewer Gram-positive catalase-positive cocci, Gram-negative bacilli, Gram-positive bacilli and significantly more samples leading to no growth, than samples before freezing. The number of samples yielding Gram-positive catalase-negative cocci was not significantly affected by freezing. In the second study, a real-time PCR-based test was performed on milk samples with an individual quarter somatic cell count above 500,000 cells/ml that were either negative (n=51 samples) or that led to the isolation of minor pathogens in culturing: Corynebacterium bovis (n=79 samples) or non-aureus staphylococci (NAS, n=32). A mastitis pathogen, beyond the result obtained with standard bacteriology, was detected on 47% of the no-growth samples, on 35% of the samples from which C. bovis had been isolated and on 25% of the samples from which NAS had been isolated. The most commonly detected major pathogen was Escherichia coli, followed by Streptococcus uberis, Arcanobacterium pyogenes/Peptoniphilus indolicus and Streptococcus dysgalactiae. These results suggest that simply freezing milk samples for 24 h does not increase the detection of intramammary bacteria in milk samples and therefore should not be recommended. However, use of the real-time PCR-based test may be useful in diagnosing intramammary infections when milk samples with high somatic cell counts are culture-negative or when culturing results in the detection of minor pathogens.
TI  - Autoregulation of lantibiotic bovicin HJ50 biosynthesis by the BovK-BovR two-component signal transduction system in Streptococcus bovis HJ50.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis HJ50 produces a lacticin 481-like 33-amino-acid-residue lantibiotic, designated bovicin HJ50. bovK-bovR in the bovicin HJ50 biosynthetic gene cluster is predicted to be a two-component signal transduction system involved in sensing signals and regulating gene expression. Disruption of bovK or bovR resulted in the abrogation of bovicin HJ50 production, suggesting both genes play important roles in bovicin HJ50 biosynthesis. Addition of exogenous bovicin HJ50 peptide to cultures of a bovM mutant that lost the capability for bovicin HJ50 production and structural gene bovA transcription in S. bovis HJ50 induced dose-dependent transcription of the bovA gene, demonstrating that bovicin HJ50 production was normally autoregulated. The transcription of bovA was no longer induced by bovicin HJ50 in bovK and bovR disruption mutants, suggesting that BovK-BovR plays an essential role in the signal transduction regulating bovicin HJ50 biosynthesis. A phosphorylation assay indicated that BovK has the ability to autophosphorylate and subsequently transfer the phosphoryl group to the downstream BovR protein to carry on signal transduction. Electromobility shift assays (EMSA) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene expression assays showed the specific binding of BovR to the bovA promoter, indicating that BovR regulates bovA expression by direct binding between them. Taken together, bovicin HJ50 biosynthesis is induced by bovicin HJ50 itself and regulated via the two-component signal transduction system BovK-BovR.
TI  - Microbial and viral pathogens in colorectal cancer.
AB  - The heterogenetic and sporadic nature of colorectal cancer has led to many epidemiological associations with causes of this disease. As our understanding of the underlying molecular processes in colorectal-cancer develops, the concept of microbial-epithelial interactions as an oncogenic trigger might provide a plausible hypothesis for the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. By contrast with other cancers of the gastrointestinal tract (gastric carcinoma, mucosa-associated lymphoid-tissue lymphoma), a direct causal link between microbial infection (bacteria and viruses) and colorectal carcinoma has not been established. Studies support the involvement of these organisms in oncogenesis, however, in colorectal cancer, clinical data are lacking. Here, we discuss current evidence (both in vitro and clinical studies), and focus on a putative role for bacterial and viral pathogens as a cause of colorectal cancer.
TI  - A novel double-tryptophan peptide pheromone controls competence in Streptococcus  spp. via an Rgg regulator.
AB  - All streptococcal genomes encode the alternative sigma factor SigX and 21 SigX-dependent proteins required for genetic transformation, yet no pyogenic streptococci are known to develop competence. Resolving this paradox may depend on understanding the regulation of sigX. We report the identification of a regulatory circuit linked to the sigX genes of mutans, pyogenic, and bovis streptococci that uses a novel small, double-tryptophan-containing sigX-inducing peptide (XIP) pheromone. In all three groups, the XIP gene (comS), and sigX have identical, non-canonical promoters consisting of 9 bp inverted repeats separated from a -10 hexamer by 19 bp. comS is adjacent to a gene encoding a putative transcription factor of the Rgg family and is regulated by its product, which we designate ComR. Deletion of comR or comS in Streptococcus mutans abolished transformability, as did deletion of the oligopeptide permease subunit oppD, suggesting that XIP is imported. Providing S. mutans with synthetic fragments of ComS revealed that seven C-terminal residues, including the WW motif, cause robust induction of both sigX and the competent state. We propose that this circuit is the proximal regulator of sigX in S. mutans, and we infer that it controls competence in a parallel way in all pyogenic and bovis streptococci.
TI  - Infectious endocarditis due to Streptococcus bovis in a patient with colon carcinoma.
AB  - We report the case of a 66 year-old female patient with infectious endocarditis due to Streptococcus bovis and adenocarcinoma of the colon that developed acute aortic insufficiency. She was submitted to aortic valve replacement surgery and later to tumor resection (right hemicolectomy). It is important to emphasize the need for complementing the study of the colon, even in asymptomatic individuals, when infectious endocarditis due to S. bovis is diagnosed.
TI  - Infective endocarditis caused by Streptococcus bovis complicated by a superior mesenteric artery mycotic aneurysm and systemic septic emboli in a patient with colon diverticulitis.
AB  - To date, Streptococcus bovis endocarditis complicated by a superior mesenteric artery mycotic aneurysm and systemic septic emboli in a patient with colon diverticulitis has never been reported. A 46-year-old man, with a history of colon diverticulitis identified by diagnostic colon fiberscope and with hypertension, presented with a 14-day history of intermittent fever. An echocardiogram revealed severe mitral regurgitation with two large floating vegetations attached to both mitral leaflets. A blood culture grew S. bovis. Abdominal pain and left leg weakness developed 10 days after admission. Computerized tomography identified a 5x3cm mycotic aneurysm, and angiography revealed a saccular aneurysm at the distal branch of the superior mesenteric artery. A duplex study revealed an intravascular mass at the left femoral artery bifurcation. The patient accordingly underwent surgical resection of the mycotic aneurysm, removal of the mycotic thrombi, and mitral valve replacement. The patient's recovery was unremarkable.
TI  - Association of symptoms with gastrointestinal microbiota in irritable bowel syndrome.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the correlations between self-reported symptoms of irritable  bowel syndrome (IBS) and the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota composition. METHODS: Fecal samples were collected from a total of 44 subjects diagnosed with IBS. Their symptoms were monitored with a validated inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire adjusted for IBS patients. Thirteen quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays were applied to evaluate the GI microbiota composition. Eubacteria and GI bacterial genera (Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Veillonella), groups (Clostridium coccoides/Eubacterium rectale, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans) and distinct bacterial phylotypes [closest 16S rDNA sequence resemblance to species Bifidobacterium catenulatum, Clostridium cocleatum, Collinsella aerofaciens (C. aerofaciens), Coprococcus eutactus (C. eutactus), Ruminococcus torques and Streptococcus bovis] with a suspected association with IBS were quantified. Correlations between quantities or presence/absence data of selected bacterial groups or phylotypes and various IBS-related symptoms were investigated. RESULTS: Associations were observed between subjects' self-reported symptoms and the presence or quantities of certain GI bacteria. A Ruminococcus torques (R. torques)-like (94% similarity in 16S rRNA gene sequence) phylotype was associated with severity of bowel symptoms. Furthermore, among IBS subjects with R. torques 94% detected, the amounts of C. cocleatum 88%, C. aerofaciens-like and C. eutactus 97% phylotypes were significantly reduced. Interesting observations were also made concerning the effect of a subject's weight on GI microbiota with regard to C. aerofaciens-like phylotype, Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. CONCLUSION: Bacteria seemingly affecting the symptom scores are unlikely to be the underlying cause or cure of IBS, but they may serve as biomarkers of the condition.
TI  - Rumen microbial population dynamics during adaptation to a high-grain diet.
AB  - High-grain adaptation programs are widely used with feedlot cattle to balance enhanced growth performance against the risk of acidosis. This adaptation to a high-grain diet from a high-forage diet is known to change the rumen microbial population structure and help establish a stable microbial population within the rumen. Therefore, to evaluate bacterial population dynamics during adaptation to a high-grain diet, 4 ruminally cannulated beef steers were adapted to a high-grain diet using a step-up diet regimen containing grain and hay at ratios of 20:80, 40:60, 60:40, and 80:20. The rumen bacterial populations were evaluated at each stage of the step-up diet after 1 week of adaptation, before the steers were transitioned to the next stage of the diet, using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis, 16S rRNA gene libraries, and quantitative real-time PCR. The T-RFLP analysis displayed a shift in the rumen microbial population structure during the final two stages of the step-up diet. The 16S rRNA gene libraries demonstrated two distinct rumen microbial populations in hay-fed and high-grain-fed animals and detected only 24 common operational taxonomic units out of 398 and 315, respectively. The 16S rRNA gene libraries of hay-fed animals contained a significantly higher number of bacteria belonging to the phylum Fibrobacteres, whereas the 16S rRNA gene libraries of grain-fed animals contained a significantly higher number of bacteria belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes. Real-time PCR analysis detected significant fold increases in the Megasphaera elsdenii, Streptococcus bovis, Selenomonas ruminantium, and Prevotella bryantii populations during adaptation to the high-concentrate (high-grain) diet, whereas the Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and Fibrobacter succinogenes populations gradually decreased as the animals were adapted to the high-concentrate diet. This study evaluates the rumen microbial population using several molecular approaches and presents a broader picture of the rumen microbial population structure during adaptation to a high-grain diet from a forage diet.
TI  - Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis caused by Streptococcus bovis: case report and  review of the literature.
AB  - Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a frequent and severe complication that occurs in patient with cirrhosis and ascites. It occurs in 10% to 30% of patients admitted to hospital. The organisms that cause SBP are predominantly enteric. Escherichia coli is the most frequent recovered pathogen, and Gram-positive bacteria, mainly Staphylococcus spp., are being considered an emerging causative agent of SBP. Streptococcus bovis that may be found as part of the commensal bowel flora in about 10% of healthy adults constitute an uncommon cause of peritonitis that was first reported in 1994. We describe the first case of SBP at the University Hospital of Santa Maria (HUSM) caused by S. bovis, resistant to the antibiotics erythromycin and clindamycin (inducible clindamycin resistance detected by disk diffusion test using the D-zone test).
TI  - Streptococcus bovis infection of total hip arthroplasty in association with carcinoma of colon.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis is normally found in the gastrointestinal tract of the human  population. The association between Streptococcus bovis and bowel neoplasia has been frequently reported. This report presents two cases of total hip arthroplasty with Streptococcus Bovis infection at 18 and 11 years after arthroplasty. The diagnosis was made with the help of clinical findings, standard radiographs, and laboratory tests (complete blood count, C-reactive protein, sedimentation rate, and the hip aspiration). Infections were treated by implant removal and antibiotic spacer implantation. Intravenous antibiotics were administered for 12 weeks. Revision arthroplasty was performed when laboratory tests (complete blood count, C-reactive protein, sedimentation rate) were within normal limits. Streptococcus bovis infection prompted the authors to investigate for any bowel malignancy. Colonoscopy and transrectal biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma in case 1, while case 2 had prior diagnosis of flat polyps in the colon. There are a limited number of reports in the literature reporting the presence of Streptococcus bovis infection concurrent with arthroplasty and bowel malignancy. These two case reports highlight the possibility of hematogenous seeding of arthroplasty components by Streptococcus bovis in patients with colonic neoplasia. Streptococcus bovis infection of hip arthroplasty may provide an opportunity for diagnosis of colonic neoplasia. Acute hip pain in patients with hip endoprostheses and simultaneous bowel malignancy should be evaluated promptly for hematogenous infection by standard radiograph, complete blood count, C-reactive protein, sedimentation rate, and hip aspiration.
TI  - Phenotyping and genotyping of streptococci in bovine milk in Argentinean dairy herds.
AB  - Most veterinary and milk hygiene laboratories identify streptococci and enterococci based on serological and biochemical tests. The analysis of 16S rDNA was suggested to be used for more exact identification; however, its use has not been considered so far in monitoring studies. The objective of the present study was to compare a conventional phenotypic method with restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of 16S rDNA (16S rDNA RFLP) for identification of streptococci isolated from composite milk samples collected in connection with intramammary infection (IMI) in six Argentinean dairy farms. Composite milk samples (n = 1223) from cows belonging to six herds were collected for bacteriological analysis. Twelve reference strains and fifty streptococci or streptococcuslike isolates were identified to species level by the API 20 Strep system, conventional biochemical tests and 16S rDNA RFLP in a blind assay. The remaining streptococci or streptococcus-like isolates (n = 40) were identified to the species level both by 16S rDNA RFLP and conventional biochemical tests. As indicated by Kappa values, agreement between the 16S rDNA RFLP and the conventional scheme for identification of Streptococcus agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae, S. uberis, S. equinus and Enterococcus faecalis was 0.91, 0.73, 0.92, 0.81 and 0.85, respectively. Together with the less frequently isolated streptococcal species, the conventional scheme correctly identified 77 out of 90 isolates (85.5%). Thus, the use of 16S rDNA RFLP is considered valuable for monitoring studies due to its affordable cost for standard laboratories.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis bacteraemia revisited: clinical and microbiological correlates in a contemporary series of 59 patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterise the clinical features, associations and outcome in a contemporary series of patients with Streptococcus bovis bacteraemia (SBB). METHODS: Retrospective analysis of all episodes of SBB at the University Hospital 12 de Octubre (Madrid, Spain) between January 1997 and November 2008 was performed. Patient data were reviewed, focusing on clinical and microbiological associations with the different biotypes of S. bovis. RESULTS: Fifty-nine episodes of SBB were documented in 59 adult patients (30 males; mean age: 70.9 +/- 15.0 years). Chronic liver disease was identified in 20 patients (33.9%). Sixteen patients (27.1%) presented infective endocarditis (IE) and 14 (23.7%) had a biliary source of bacteraemia. Thirty-three patients (55.9%) underwent colonic evaluation, adenomatous polyps being the most common finding (21 patients). Malignancy was diagnosed following SBB in 9 cases, including 6 patients with colorectal carcinoma (18.2% of those who underwent colonic evaluation). Of 22 isolates biotyped, 12 were S. bovis biotype I and 10 were S. bovis biotype II. IE was more frequent among patients with S. bovis biotype I (P =0.010), whereas bacteraemia due to biotype II species was more likely to be of biliary origin (P=0.078). CONCLUSIONS: S. bovis biotyping identifies some clinically relevant associations.
TI  - Dissection of the bridging pattern of bovicin HJ50, a lantibiotic containing a characteristic disulfide bridge.
AB  - Bovicin HJ50, a lantibiotic produced by Streptococcus bovis HJ50, is featured by  the presence of a disulfide bridge. This study described a simplified in vitro synthetic strategy for producing bovicin HJ50 totally based on Escherichia coli expression system. In this strategy termed as Semi-in vitro biosynthesis (SIVB), prepeptide BovA and modification enzyme BovM were co-expressed to generate posttranslationally modified BovA. Then a specific protease BovT150 was employed to remove the leader peptide in vitro and produce biologically active bovicin HJ50. Via SIVB, a series of ring-broken bovicin mutants C13A, C21A, C29A and T10A/C32A were prepared by introducing site-directed mutations into bovA gene. Further, we analyzed the bridging patterns of these mutants through chemical modification and successfully clarified the bridging pattern of bovicin HJ50. The results showed that two thioether bridges exist between Thr8 and Cys13, and Thr10 and Cys32, respectively, and that the disulfide bond bridging Cys21 and 29 is very relevant for the antimicrobial activity of bovicin HJ50. This is the first study that reports the bridging pattern of bovicin HJ50.
TI  - High temporal and inter-individual variation detected in the human ileal microbiota.
AB  - The diversity and temporal stability of the predominant bacteria in the human ileum was studied with the use of ileal effluent samples of seven individuals with Brooke ileostomies. The total number of bacteria within the ileal effluent was in the range of 10(7) -10(8) bacteria per gram (wet weight). The diversity of the bacteria in the ileal effluent showed marked differences compared with that in faecal samples from age-matched healthy adults. The ileal effluent had a higher relative abundance of species within the orders Lactobacillales and Clostridiales, mainly Streptococcus bovis-related species, and the Veillonella group, and a lower proportion of species related to Ruminococcus gnavus, R. obeum and Bacteroides plebeius. In addition, inter-individual differences were found, indicative of a highly personal ileal microbiota profile. Furthermore, temporal profiles showed large fluctuations per individual over a period of 9-28 days (average similarity over a period of 9 days was as low as 44%), and differences between morning and afternoon profiles were observed. Parallel cloning and sequencing efforts revealed several phylotypes that were not identified in previous studies (12 out of 65 phylotypes showed less than 97% sequence similarity with previously reported sequences). Achaea were found to be below detection limit by quantitative PCR. Overall, the results indicate that the microbiota of the human ileum is relatively unstable, less complex and consisting of different dominating phylotypes when compared with the colonic microbiota.
TI  - Increased exposure to bacterial antigen RpL7/L12 in early stage colorectal cancer patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer 2010. (c) 2010 American Cancer Society. : Intestinal bacteria  have long been implicated in colorectal cancer pathology, and many reports point to a close linkage between Streptococcus bovis biotype I (recently renamed Streptococcus gallolyticus) infections and tumors of the human colon. This work aims to investigate the humoral immune response to this bacterium during different stages of colorectal cancer. METHODS: The presence of serum antibodies against S. bovis antigen RpL7/L12, previously assigned as a potential diagnostic antigen, was evaluated in Dutch (n = 209) and American (n = 112) populations using a newly developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The analyses consistently showed that an immune response against this bacterial antigen was increased in polyp patients and stage I/II colorectal cancer patients as compared with asymptomatic individuals. This was not paralleled by increased antibody production to endotoxin, an intrinsic cell wall component of the majority of intestinal bacteria, which implies that the humoral immune response against RpL7/L12 is not a general phenomenon induced by the loss of colonic barrier function. Notably, increased anti-RpL7/L12 levels were not or were only mildly detected in late stage colorectal cancer patients having lymph node or distant metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer 2010. (c) 2010 American Cancer Society. : These findings are indicative of an increased exposure to antigen RpL7/L12 during early stages of colon carcinogenesis and suggest that intestinal bacteria such as S. bovis constitute a risk factor for the progression of premalignant lesions into early stage carcinomas. Clearly, the current findings emphasize the necessity for further studies on the possible etiologic relationship between intestinal bacteria and human colorectal cancer.
TI  - Activity of solvent extracts of Prosopis spicigera, Zingiber officinale and Trachyspermum ammi against multidrug resistant bacterial and fungal strains.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The emerging trends of multidrug resistance among several groups of microorganisms against different classes of antibiotics led different researchers to develop efficient drugs from plant sources to counter multidrug resistant strains. This study investigated different solvent extracts of Prosopis spicigera (P. Spicigera), Zingiber officinale, and Trachyspermum ammi (T. ammi) to determine their efficacy against multidrug resistant microbes. METHODOLOGY: Successive extractions of these plants were performed using a Soxhlet apparatus, using solvents with increasing polarities. Preliminary phytochemical analysis was also performed. Minimum inhibitory concentration was determined by a two-fold serial dilution method followed by determination of minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration. Multidrug resistant (MDR) strains of Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata, Escherichia coli and reference strains of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus bovis were used in the study. RESULTS: The ethanolic fraction of P. spicigera (least minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] - 4.88 microg/ml) demonstrated a remarkable inhibition of the microorganisms while fractions obtained from those of Zingiber officinale (least MIC-78.125 microg/ml) exhibited little activity. The petroleum ether fraction of T. ammi (least MIC- 625 microg/ml) showed best activity when compared to its other fractions. Qualitative analysis of the phytoconstituents was also performed. CONCLUSIONS: The potency shown by these extracts recommends their use against multidrug resistant microorganisms. This study also showed that P. spicigera could be a potential source of new antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Molecular characterization and significance of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase  in a ruminal bacterium, Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - To gain knowledge about the significance of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase (PCK) in Streptococcus bovis, the sequence of the gene encoding PCK (pck) was determined. Transcriptional analysis indicated that the pck is transcribed in a monocistronic fashion. The level of pck-mRNA was higher when cells were grown on lactose than on glucose, suggesting that PCK synthesis increases when the growth rate is low. The pck-mRNA level was higher in a mutant lacking ccpA, which encodes the catabolite control protein A (CcpA), than in the parent strain, suggesting that pck transcription is suppressed by CcpA. S. bovis PCK showed oxaloacetate (OAA)-decarboxylating activity, but no PEP-carboxylating activity (reverse reaction). In S. bovis, OAA was speculated to be produced from PEP via pyruvate. Disruption of pck in S. bovis resulted in decreased growth rate and cell yield. When a pck-disrupted mutant was grown in a medium lacking amino acids, the lag phase was longer and the cell yield was lower than the case of the parent strain. These results suggest that pck is involved in the initiation of growth, including the induction of amino acid synthesis and energy metabolism.
TI  - Involvement of two-component signal transduction system, ComDE, in the regulation of growth and genetic transformation, in the ruminal bacterium Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - In ruminants, Streptococcus bovis is considered to be associated with acute rumen acidosis. To elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of S. bovis growth, we investigated the function of the two components of the peptide pheromone-signaling system, ComD and ComE, which are encoded by comD and comE, respectively, via the competence-stimulating peptide ComC, which is encoded by comC. Deletion of entire comC and two-thirds of comD resulted in decreased growth rate, which may be related to the change in the expression of several proteins, as shown by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The transcript level of comED was decreased by the disruption of comCD, suggesting that the transcription of comED might be stimulated by ComC. The transformation frequency was decreased by the disruption of comCD. Addition of recombinant ComC to S. bovis cultures increased the growth rate and transformation frequency. In the cultures of mixed ruminal microbes, addition of mature ComC peptide increased the number of S. bovis per total bacterial counts as estimated by the cDNA amounts of 16SrRNA. Thus, the peptide pheromone-signaling system via ComC, D, and E might be involved in the control of S. bovis growth in addition to competence development. This is the first report suggesting that an autoinducing peptide functions in the ruminal ecosystem.
TI  - Effects of hops (Humulus lupulus L.) extract on volatile fatty acid production by rumen bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the effects of hops extract on in vitro volatile fatty acid (VFA) production by bovine rumen micro-organisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: When mixed rumen microbes were suspended in media containing carbohydrates, the initial rates of VFA production were suppressed by beta-acid-rich hops extract. The rates of VFA production increased over extended incubations (24 h), and hops extract caused an increase in the propionate to acetate ratio. Hops extract inhibited the growth and metabolism of Streptococcus bovis, but Selenomonas ruminantium and Megasphaera elsdenii were not affected. Likewise, the propionate production of M. elsdenii/S. bovis co-cultures, but not M. elsdenii/S. ruminantium co-cultures, was decreased in the presence of hops extract. CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the hops inhibit Gram-positive lactic acid bacteria (S. bovis), and the rumen microbial community requires a period of adaptation before normal VFA production resumes. Selenomonas bovis and S. ruminantium both produce lactate, which is the substrate for propionate production by M. elsdenii. However, S. ruminantium has an outer membrane, while S. bovis does not. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: The enhanced production of the gluconeogenesis precursor, propionic acid, provides further evidence that plant secondary metabolites from hops could be used to improve rumen fermentation.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in cirrhotic patients: case series and description of the prognostic role of acute renal failure.
AB  - AIM: To analyze the mortality risk factors in cirrhotic patients with bacterial meningitis (BM). BACKGROUND: Cirrhotic patients are susceptible to infections. Despite its high mortality rate, BM has not been extensively studied in this group of patients. STUDY: BM patients diagnosed with cirrhosis, between 1987 and 2008, were studied. BM was defined as the presence of signs or symptoms of meningitis and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leukocyte count >100/mm3 or the presence of bacteria in CSF. RESULTS: We identified 4955 infections among 7591 cirrhotic patients; 12 (0.2%) had BM. The mean age at diagnosis was 60+/-16 years. Abnormal mental status (83%), fever (67%), and neck stiffness (67%) were the most frequent clinical presentations. The sensitivity of CSF culture was 75% (Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2; Staphylococcus aureus, 2; Listeria monocytogenes, 1; Group B Streptococcus, 1; Streptococcus agalactiae, 1; Streptococcus bovis, 1; and Escherichia coli, 1), and its correlation with blood culture was 78%. Five patients died. On admission, the serum creatinine level was 1.63+/-0.93 mg/dL. A serum creatinine level >/=1.3 mg/dL was associated with increased mortality (P=0.028). The model for end-stage liver disease score, gastrointestinal bleeding, bilirubin level >3.5 mg/dL, hepatic encephalopathy, diabetes mellitus, and results of cytology and biochemistry tests of CSF were not associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: BM in cirrhotic patients is associated with a high mortality rate. The clinical and microbiologic features of BM in cirrhotic patients differ from those in the general population. A serum creatinine level >/=1.3 mg/dL on admission is associated with a higher risk of mortality.
TI  - A case of Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus infective endocarditis with colon cancer: identification by 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing.
AB  - Although the association between Streptococcus bovis endocarditis and colon carcinoma is well known, very few cases of S. bovis infection associated with underlying malignancies have been reported in Korea. The S. bovis group has been recently reclassified and renamed as Streptococcus gallolyticus and Streptococcus infantarius subspecies under a new nomenclature system. We report a case of infective endocarditis with colon cancer caused by S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (previously named S. bovis biotype I). A 59-yr-old woman presented with a 1-month history of fever. Initial blood cultures were positive for gram-positive cocci, and echocardiography showed vegetation on mitral and aortic valves. Antibiotic treatment for infective endocarditis was started. The infecting strain was a catalase-negative and bile-esculin-positive alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus susceptible to penicillin and vancomycin. The strain was identified as S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus with the use of the Vitek 2 GPI and API 20 Strep systems (bioMerieux, USA). The 16S rDNA sequences of the blood culture isolates showed 100% homology with those of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus reported in GenBank. The identification of the infecting organism, and the subsequent communication among clinical microbiologists and physicians about the changed nomenclature, led to the detection of colon cancer. The patient recovered after treatment with antibiotics, valve surgery, and operation for colon cancer. This is the first report of biochemical and genetic identification of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus causing infective endocarditis associated with underlying colon cancer in a Korean patient.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis meningitis and hemorrhoids.
AB  - We report a case of Streptococcus bovis (Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus) meningitis, a rare cause of central nervous system (CNS) infection in an adult, and comment on the importance of investigation of the lower gastrointestinal tract to identify a portal of entry in cases of systemic Streptococcus bovis infection.
TI  - The incidence of bacteraemia after argon plasma coagulation in patients with chronic radiation proctocolitis.
AB  - AIM: Argon plasma coagulation (APC) is considered a safe treatment for haemorrhagic chronic radiation proctocolitis (CRPC), but bacteraemia is a rare complication. The study aimed to evaluate the frequency of bacteraemia after APC. METHOD: A prospective study of 21 patients who underwent APC (30 procedures) for CRPC was carried out. Blood cultures (Bactec((R)) ) were obtained before and 30 min after the procedure (60 samples total). Patients were monitored for 48 h after the procedure to detect signs of infection. RESULTS: None of the 21 patients had fever or any sign suggestive of infection after any of the 30 sessions. All baseline blood cultures were negative and two (7%) of the 30-min blood cultures were positive (Staphylococcus hominis n = 1; Streptococcus bovis and Rhodotorula sp n = 1). The first was likely to be a contaminant and the second patient had no evidence of any other colonic disease (neoplasia or polyps) beside CRPC. CONCLUSION: APC is a low-risk procedure regarding bacteraemia and does not warrant prophylactic antibiotic administration.

TI  - Changes in faecal bacteria associated with concentrate and forage-only diets fed  to horses in training.
AB  - REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Diets rich in readily fermentable carbohydrates, fed traditionally to meet the increased energy requirements of the performance horse, are associated with a number of gastrointestinal disorders that involve disturbances in the intestinal microbiota, however, these changes are poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: With the long-term objective of improving intestinal health and to increase understanding of the relationship between diet and microbiota, the effect of feeding Standardbred horses a high-energy forage-only (F) diet was studied compared to a more traditional forage-concentrate (C) diet on faecal microbiota. METHODS: Diets were fed in a cross-over design to 6 mature geldings on a scheduled training regime, both periods consisting of 29 days. DNA was extracted from faecal samples collected at 4 time points from each period, bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified and community composition assessed by terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism, cloning and sequencing. Faecal pH and cultivable lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and enterobacteria were also assessed on the final collection day of each period. RESULTS: Diet F resulted in a microbial composition that was more stable between sampling periods and had lower counts (P < 0.05) of cultivable LAB and specifically members of the Streptococcus bovislequinus complex. Motile and swarming Lactobacillus ruminis was present in all horses on diet C and not in horses on diet F. Diet C also resulted in the increase (P < 0.05) in members of Clostridiaceae cluster III and a concomitant reduction (P < 0.05) in an unknown group of Bacteroidales. CONCLUSIONS AND POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: The greater microbial stability and reduction in LAB and members of the Streptococcus bovis/equinus complex on diet F indicate an opportunity to develop feeding strategies that support equine health and welfare. Novel changes identified in the faecal microbiota that resulted from carbohydrate inclusion merit further investigation.
TI  - Central nervous system infections in Filipino patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Infections including those of the central nervous system  (CNS) are a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This case series describes the etiology, contributing factors and outcomes of CNS infections in a group of Filipino patients with SLE. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of SLE patients diagnosed and confined for a CNS infection at the University of Santo Tomas Hospital in Manila, Philippines, from 1997 to 2007. RESULTS: A total of 23 SLE patients (22 females) diagnosed with CNS infection were included in this study. The mean age was 25.8 years (range 12-51) at SLE diagnosis, and 30.9 years (range 14-58) at CNS infection, with a mean disease duration of 55 months (range 7-125). Nineteen cases (82.6%) were meningitis, and four (17.4%) were diagnoses of brain abscess. The etiologic agents were identified as Cryptococcus neoformans in seven (30.4%), Mycobacterium tuberculosis in seven (30.4%), Streptococcus pneumoniae in two (8.7%), Salmonella sp. in one (4.4%), Corynebacterium bovis with Actinomyces sp. in one (4.4%), and no isolate in five (21.7%). The average daily prednisone dose was 28.9 mg (range 0-60 mg); 10 patients had recently received pulse cyclophosphamide, and two were on mycophenolate mofetil at the time of infection. Most cases had active SLE; the lone patient in disease remission had S. pneumoniae meningitis post-splenectomy. The most common presentation was headache (100%) and fever (87%). The infection resolved completely in nine patients (39.1%), and resolved with sequelae in two patients (8.7%); 12 patients (52.2%) died. CONCLUSION: We described the etiology and outcomes of CNS infections in a group of Filipino patients with SLE. Risk factors included active SLE in the majority of cases requiring moderate- to high-dose steroids and other immunosuppressants like cyclophosphamide. Although C. neoformans and M. tuberculosis were the most common etiologic agents, it is just as important to search for less common organisms which can produce disease in highly susceptible hosts. A high index of suspicion and early appropriate management are crucial to favorable outcome among these patients.
TI  - Streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus (biotype II/2), a newly reported cause of adult meningitis.
AB  - We report the first case of adult meningitis confirmed to be due to Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus. Phenotypically reported as Streptococcus bovis biotype II/2, 16S rRNA sequencing revealed S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus. Because of taxonomic uncertainties, S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus may be an underrecognized agent of systemic infections.
TI  - Identification of lactic acid bacteria associated with the production of plaa-som, a traditional fermented fish product of Thailand.
AB  - Plaa-som is a Thai fermented fish product for which whole fish or fish fillets are fermented with either cooked rice or steamed sticky rice, salt, and garlic. A total of 762 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated during plaa-som fermentation by culture on CaCO(3)-MRS agar plates. They were screened and grouped by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA), giving six groups that were identified by ribosomal DNA sequencing as Lactococcus garvieae, Streptococcus bovis, Weissella cibaria, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus fermentum. Freshly mixed ingredients contained low populations of LAB (less than 10 CFU/g) that subsequently grew during fermentation to final populations of approximately 10(7)CFU/g. Early stages of the process were dominated by the presence of Lc. garvieae, S. bovis, and W. cibaria. At 48 h into fermentation, W. cibaria, P. pentosaceus, and Lb. plantarum were prevalent, and gave way to a dominance of Lb. plantarum that completed the fermentation. A mixture of these LAB species could be considered as species for development of a starter culture for plaa-som fermentation.
TI  - Characterization of bacteriocin produced by Streptococcus bovis J2 40-2 isolated  from traditional fermented milk 'Dahi'.
AB  - A bacteriocin-producing strain Streptococcus bovis J2 40-2 was isolated from traditional fermented milk 'Dahi' in Bangladesh. Despite its narrow antimicrobial spectrum, it showed strong antimicrobial activity against extremely challenging and problematic organisms in foods, such as Listeria monocytogenes. Bacteriocin was sensitive to several proteolytic enzymes and showed antimicrobial activity over a wide pH range of 2.0-10.0. It was stable when heated to 110 degrees C for 20 min, but lost 25% of its activity when heated to 121 degrees C for 15 or 20 min. Optimum bacteriocin production (5600 AU/mL) was achieved when the strain was cultured at 37 degrees C for 24 h in MRS medium rather than in TYLG, GM17, or skim milk medium. Bacteriocin was partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation (80% saturation), dialysis (cut-off MW: 3500) and gel filtration chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that bacteriocin had a molecular weight of approximately 4.5 kDa.

TI  - Age-dependent profile of left-sided infective endocarditis: a 3-center experience.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The influence of age on the main epidemiological, clinical, echocardiographic, microbiological, and prognostic features of patients with infective endocarditis remains unknown. We present the series with the largest numbers and range of ages of subjects to date that analyzes the influence of age on the main characteristics of patients with isolated left-sided infective endocarditis. Furthermore, this series is the first one in which patients have been distributed according to age quartile. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 600 episodes of left-sided endocarditis consecutively diagnosed in 3 tertiary centers were stratified into age-specific quartiles and 107 variables compared between the different groups. With increasing age, the percentage of women, previous heart disease, predisposing disease (diabetes mellitus and cancer), and infection by enterococci and Streptococcus bovis also increased. Valvular insufficiency and perforation and Staphylococcus aureus infection were more common in younger patients. The therapeutic approach differed depending on patient age because of the growing proportion of older patients who only received medical treatment. Clinical course and hospital prognosis were worse in the older patients because of increased surgical mortality among them. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing age is associated with less valvular impairment (insufficiency and perforation), a more favorable microbiological profile, and increased surgical mortality among adults with left-sided infective endocarditis.
TI  - Genome sequence of Streptococcus gallolyticus: insights into its adaptation to the bovine rumen and its ability to cause endocarditis.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly known as Streptococcus bovis biotype I) is an increasing cause of endocarditis among streptococci and frequently associated with colon cancer. S. gallolyticus is part of the rumen flora but also a cause of disease in ruminants as well as in birds. Here we report the complete nucleotide sequence of strain UCN34, responsible for endocarditis in a patient also suffering from colon cancer. Analysis of the 2,239 proteins encoded by its 2,350-kb-long genome revealed unique features among streptococci, probably related to its adaptation to the rumen environment and its capacity to cause endocarditis. S. gallolyticus has the capacity to use a broad range of carbohydrates of plant origin, in particular to degrade polysaccharides derived from the plant cell wall. Its genome encodes a large repertoire of transporters and catalytic activities, like tannase, phenolic compounds decarboxylase, and bile salt hydrolase, that should contribute to the detoxification of the gut environment. Furthermore, S. gallolyticus synthesizes all 20 amino acids and more vitamins than any other sequenced Streptococcus species. Many of the genes encoding these specific functions were likely acquired by lateral gene transfer from other bacterial species present in the rumen. The surface properties of strain UCN34 may also contribute to its virulence. A polysaccharide capsule might be implicated in resistance to innate immunity defenses, and glucan mucopolysaccharides, three types of pili, and collagen binding proteins may play a role in adhesion to tissues in the course of endocarditis.
TI  - Development of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for the detection of Mycobacterium bovis.
AB  - Bovine tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium bovis is an important zoonosis. In this study, a simple, rapid method for detecting this organism was developed based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification of the mpt83 gene. The technique will be of value in the clinical and field-based diagnosis of M. bovis and can differentiate it from other bacteria such as Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-haemolytic streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The limit of detection was 10 copies/muL and the results were corroborated by PCR. The method was highly specific and more sensitive than PCR.
TI  - Rumen chemical and bacterial changes during stepwise adaptation to a high-concentrate diet in goats.
AB  - The correlation between rumen chemical and bacterial changes was investigated during a four periodical stepwise adaptation to a high-concentrate diet (concentrate level at 0%, 30%, 50% and 70% for diet I to IV, respectively) in goats. The results showed that ruminal pH decreased from 6.7 to 5.5 after switching from diet I to II, and was maintained at about 5.5 on diet III. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis results showed that the rumen bacterial community was relatively stable during the initial three feeding periods, except for the appearance of three bands when diet changed from I to II, suggesting that an appropriate concentrate level can promote the proliferation of some bacteria. After 12 days of feeding diet III, total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration and butyrate proportion decreased. At days 2 and 3 of feeding diet IV, ruminal pH declined sharply to 5.3 and 4.7, respectively, and total VFA concentration decreased further while lactic acid concentration increased markedly, suggesting a relation between lactic acid accumulation and ruminal pH decline. At the same time, many bacteria disappeared, including most fibrolytic-related bacteria while Streptococcus bovis and Prevotella-like species dominated. Interestingly, Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens-like species maintained throughout the experiment, suggesting its tolerance to low pH. In conclusion, rumen bacterial community was relatively stable feeding 0% to 50% concentrate diets, and it was observed that appropriate concentrate levels in the diet could increase the diversity of rumen bacteria. However, concentrate-rich diets caused lactic acid accumulation and low ruminal pH that caused the disappearance of most fibrolytic-related bacteria sensitive to low pH while S. bovis and genus Prevotella persisted.

TI  - Identification of tetracycline- and erythromycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci within the fermenting microflora of an Italian dairy food product.
AB  - AIMS: Microbiological and molecular analysis of antibiotic resistance in Gram-positive cocci derived from the Italian PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) dairy food product Mozzarella di Bufala Campana. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and seven coccal colonies were assigned to Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus bovis genera by ARDRA analysis (amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis). Among them, 16 Ent. faecalis, 26 L. lactis and 39 Strep. bovis displayed high minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for tetracycline, while 17 L. lactis showed high MIC values for both tetracycline and erythromycin. Strain typing and molecular analysis of the phenotypically resistant isolates demonstrated the presence of the tet(M) gene in the tetracycline-resistant strains and of tet(S) and erm(B) in the double-resistant strains. Southern blot analysis revealed plasmid localization of L. lactis tet(M), as well as of the erm(B) and tet(S) genes. Genetic linkage of erm(B) and tet(S) was also demonstrated by PCR amplification. Conjugation experiments demonstrated horizontal transfer to Ent. faecalis strain JH2-2 only for the plasmid-borne L. lactis tet(M) gene. CONCLUSIONS: We characterized tetracycline-and erythromycin-resistance genes in coccal species, representing the fermenting microflora of a typical Italian dairy product. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These results are of particular relevance from the food safety viewpoint, especially in the light of the potential risk of horizontal transfer of antibiotic-resistance genes among foodborne commensal bacteria.
TI  - pH dynamics and bacterial community composition in the rumen of lactating dairy cows.
AB  - The influence of pH dynamics on ruminal bacterial community composition was studied in 8 ruminally cannulated Holstein cows fitted with indwelling electrodes that recorded pH at 10-min intervals over a 54-h period. Cows were fed a silage-based total mixed ration supplemented with monensin. Ruminal samples were collected each day just before feeding and at 3 and 6h after feeding. Solid and liquid phases were separated at collection, and extracted DNA was subjected to PCR amplification followed by automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA). Although cows displayed widely different pH profiles (mean pH=6.11 to 6.51, diurnal pH range=0.45 to 1.39), correspondence analysis of the ARISA profiles revealed that 6 of the 8 cows showed very similar bacterial community compositions. The 2 cows having substantially different community compositions had intermediate mean pH values (6.30 and 6.33) and intermediate diurnal pH ranges (averaging 0.89 and 0.81 pH units). Fortuitously, these 2 cows alone also displayed milk fat depression, along with markedly higher ruminal populations of 1 bacterial operational taxonomic unit (OTU) and reduced populations of another ARISA amplicon. Cloning and sequencing of the elevated OTU revealed phylogenetic similarity to Megasphaera elsdenii, a species reportedly associated with milk fat depression. The higher populations of both M. elsdenii and OTU246 in these 2 cows were confirmed using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) with species-specific primers, and the fraction of total bacterial rDNA copies contributed by these 2 taxa were very highly correlated within individual cows. By contrast, the fraction of total bacterial rDNA copies contributed by Streptococcus bovis and genus Ruminococcus, 2 taxa expected to respond to ruminal pH, did not differ among cows (mean= <0.01 and 10.6%, respectively, of rRNA gene copies, determined by qPCR). The data indicate that cows with widely differing pH profiles can have similar ruminal bacterial community compositions, and that milk fat depression can occur at intermediate ruminal pH. The results support recent reports that milk fat depression is associated with shifts in bacterial community composition in rumine and is specifically related to the relative abundance of Megasphaera elsdenii.
TI  - Effects of acarbose on ruminal fermentation, blood metabolites and microbial profile involved in ruminal acidosis in lactating cows fed a high-carbohydrate ration.
AB  - The objective was to evaluate the effects of an inhibitor of alpha-amylase and glucosidase (acarbose, Pfizer Limited, Corby, UK) on ruminal fermentation, blood metabolism and microbial profile in dairy cows in a 2x2 cross-over experiment. Eight Holstein cows fitted with rumen cannulas (milk yield, 24.3+/-2.35 kg/d, body weight, 622+/-54 kg, days in milk, 183+/-67, 5 multiparous and 3 primiparous) were used. Treatments were: control (no additive, CTR) and alpha-amylase and glucosidase inhibitor (0.75 g acarbose-premix/cow per d, AMI). Animals were given ad-libitum access to a high non-fibre carbohydrate (NFC) partial mixed ration (PMR) containing 17.6% crude protein, 28.3% neutral detergent fibre, and 46.5% NFC in the dry matter and supplementary concentrate during milking. Blood samples were taken to determine blood glucose, insulin and urea within the first hour after the morning feeding on two separate days in each period. Samples of ruminal contents were collected during 3 d in each period at 0, 4 and 8 h after feeding to determine volatile fatty acid and ammonia-N concentrations and to quantify protozoa, Streptococcus bovis and Megasphaera elsdenii. Rumen pH was recorded electronically at 22-min intervals during 6 d in each period. Results were analysed using a mixed-effects model. Cows on AMI treatment spent less time with ruminal pH <5.6 compared with cows in the CTR group (3.74 and 6.52+/-0.704 h/d, respectively). Cows in the AMI group had greater daily average pH compared with those in the CTR group (6.05 and 5.92+/-0.042, respectively). AMI animals tended (P=0.09) to have lower Str. bovis to Meg. elsdenii ratio than CTR (4.09 and 26.8+/-12.0, respectively). These results indicate that dietary supplementation with acarbose in dairy cattle fed high-production rations may be effective in reducing the time for which rumen pH is suboptimal, with no negative effects on ruminal fermentation and blood metabolites.
TI  - Description of development of rumen ecosystem by PCR assay in milk-fed, weaned and finished lambs in an intensive fattening system.
AB  - This study examined the reticulo-rumen characteristics of the microbial community and its fermentative characteristics in milk-fed, at weaning and finished lambs in a conventional fattening system. Five lambs were assigned to each of three groups: milk-fed lambs slaughtered at 30 days (T30), weaned lambs slaughtered at 45 days (T45) and 'finished lambs' slaughtered at 90 days (T90). At slaughter, rumen size, fermentation parameters (pH, volatile fatty acids and microbial enzyme activity) and protozoal counts were recorded. Quantitative PCR was used to quantify the genes encoding 16S and 18S ribosomal DNA of the rumen bacterial and protozoal populations, respectively, and the sequential colonization of the rumen by cellulolytic (Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens) and amylolytic (Prevotella ruminicola, Streptococcus bovis) bacteria, and protozoa (Entodinium sp.). Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to study the development of rumen microbiota biodiversity. Intake of solid food before weaning caused a significant increase in rumen weight (p < 0.0001) and bacterial DNA (p < 0.05) and volatile fatty acid analysis concentration (p < 0.01), whereas pH declined. In milk-fed lambs, cellulolytic bacteria were evident after 30 days. Thereafter, in the 45-day and 90-day groups, the proportions of R. flavefaciens decreased and R. albus increased. Amylolytic bacteria were present in milk-fed lambs; the proportion of P. ruminicola increased in fattening lambs and S. bovis was the least abundant species. Protozoal concentrations were irregular; milk-fed lambs had a significant number of protozoa species from Entodinium and subfamily Isotrichiidae, but they disappeared at weaning. Lamb rumen were refaunated in some individuals at 90 days (Entodinium and subfamily Diplodiniinae spp.), although individual concentrations were variable.
TI  - Streptococcus sanguis endocarditis associated with colonic carcinoma.
AB  - Infective endocarditis caused by Streptococcus bovis is known to be associated with colorectal malignancy. Other less common streptococci, specifically Streptococcus sanguis, can be similarly associated with gastrointestinal carcinoma. We present a case of disseminated colorectal carcinoma occurring after a confirmed S sanguis endocarditis, that required mitral valve surgery. There may be a need for gastrointestinal surveillance in patients presenting with bacteraemia caused by less common streptococci.
TI  - Effect of Lactobacillus casei on Streptococcus bovis in faecal flora.
AB  - Bacteraemia caused by Streptococcus bovis is often associated with colorectal tumours. Also, experimental studies have been proposed that S bovis acts as a promoter of tumours. We report the case of a man with colon adenoma who had a high proportion of S bovis in his faecal flora. He was treated with a Lactobacillus casei preparation (BLP) and the effect on the faecal flora was examined. L casei reduced the proportion of S bovis (from 43% down to 9%), and the effect continued after the administration of BLP was stopped. Our data indicate that BLP can repress the excessive colonisation of S bovis.

AB  - Streptococci, enterococci and Streptococcus-like bacteria are frequent etiologic  agents of infective endocarditis and correct species identification can be a laboratory challenge. Viridans streptococci (VS) not seldomly cause contamination of blood cultures. Vitek 2 and partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene were applied in order to compare the results of both methods. STRAINS ORIGINATED FROM TWO GROUPS OF PATIENTS: 149 strains from patients with infective endocarditis and 181 strains assessed as blood culture contaminants. Of the 330 strains, based on partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing results, 251 (76%) were VS strains, 10 (3%) were pyogenic streptococcal strains, 54 (16%) were E. faecalis strains and 15 (5%) strains belonged to a group of miscellaneous catalase-negative, Gram-positive cocci. Among VS strains, respectively, 220 (87,6%) and 31 (12,3%) obtained agreeing and non-agreeing identifications with the two methods with respect to allocation to the same VS group. Non-agreeing species identification mostly occurred among strains in the contaminant group, while for endocarditis strains notably fewer disagreeing results were observed.Only 67 of 150 strains in the mitis group strains obtained identical species identifications by the two methods. Most VS strains belonging to the groups of salivarius, anginosus, and mutans obtained agreeing species identifications with the two methods, while this only was the case for 13 of the 21 bovis strains. Pyogenic strains (n=10), Enterococcus faecalis strains (n=54) and a miscellaneous group of catalase-negative, Gram-positive cocci (n=15) seemed well identified by both methods, except that disagreements in identifications in the miscellaneous group of strains occurred for 6 of 15 strains.
TI  - Dark hypopyon in Streptococcus bovis endogenous endophthalmitis: clinicopathologic correlations.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this report is to present a previously unreported causative organism associated with brown-pigmented hypopyon in a patient with endophthalmitis. METHODS: This is a retrospective case report which includes clinicopathologic correlations. RESULTS: Vitreous cultures demonstrated Streptococcus bovis infection resulting in a brown-pigmented hypopyon, with uveal pigment found intra- and extracellularly on pathologic examination of the pupillary membrane. CONCLUSIONS: S. bovis endophthalmitis may be a cause of dark hypopyon, especially in patients with a history of liver disease, and, when identified, warrants colonoscopy and cardiac workup.

TI  - Partial recN gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - Partial sequences of the recN gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. The partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. The mean DNA sequence similarity of recN gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be lower than those of the 16S rRNA gene (94.1 %), rpoB (84.6 %), sodA (74.8 %), groEL (78.1 %) and gyrB (73.2 %). Phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: Streptococcus salivarius, S. equinus, S. hyovaginalis/S. pluranimalium/S. thoraltensis, S. pyogenes, S. mutans and S. suis. The 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: Streptococcus sanguinis/S. cristatus/S. sinensis, S. anginosus/S. intermedius/S. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and S. mitis/S. infantis/S. peroris/S. oralis/S. oligofermentans/S. pneumoniae/S. pseudopneumoniae. The partial recN gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. This observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groEL, gyrB, rpoB and sodA). A high percentage of similarity was found between S. intermedius and S. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recN gene. To study the genetic diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recN, groEL, sodA, gyrB and rpoB sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. The results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.
TI  - Evolutionary relationships among salivarius streptococci as inferred from multilocus phylogenies based on 16S rRNA-encoding, recA, secA, and secY gene sequences.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococci are divided into six phylogenetic groups, i.e, anginosus, bovis, mitis, mutans, pyogenic, and salivarius, with the salivarius group consisting of only three distinct species. Two of these species, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus vestibularis, are members of the normal human oral microflora whereas the third, Streptococcus thermophilus, is found in bovine milk. Given that S. salivarius and S. vestibularis share several physiological characteristics, in addition to inhabiting the same ecosystem, one would assume that they would be more closely related to each other than to S. thermophilus. However, the few phylogenetic trees published so far suggest that S. vestibularis is more closely related to S. thermophilus. To determine whether this phylogenetic relationship is genuine, we performed phylogenetic inferences derived from secA and secY, the general secretion housekeeping genes, recA, a gene from a separate genetic locus that encodes a major component of the homologous recombinational apparatus, and 16S rRNA-encoding gene sequences using other streptococcal species as outgroups. RESULTS: The maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum parsimony (MP) phylogenetic inferences derived from the secA and recA gene sequences provided strong support for the S. vestibularis/S. thermophilus sister-relationship, whereas 16S rRNA-encoding and secY-based analyses could not discriminate between alternate topologies. Phylogenetic analyses derived from the concatenation of these sequences unambiguously supported the close affiliation of S. vestibularis and S. thermophilus. CONCLUSION: Our results corroborated the sister-relationship between S. vestibularis and S. thermophilus and the concomitant early divergence of S. salivarius at the base of the salivarius lineage.
TI  - Rumen microbiome composition determined using two nutritional models of subacute  ruminal acidosis.
AB  - Subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) is a metabolic disease in dairy cattle that occurs during early and mid-lactation and has traditionally been characterized by low rumen pH, but lactic acid does not accumulate as in acute lactic acid acidosis. It is hypothesized that factors such as increased gut permeability, bacterial lipopolysaccharides, and inflammatory responses may have a role in the etiology of SARA. However, little is known about the nature of the rumen microbiome during SARA. In this study, we analyzed the microbiome of 64 rumen samples taken from eight lactating Holstein dairy cattle using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (TRFLP) of 16S rRNA genes and real-time PCR. We used rumen samples from two published experiments in which SARA had been induced with either grain or alfalfa pellets. The results of TRFLP analysis indicated that the most predominant shift during SARA was a decline in gram-negative Bacteroidetes organisms. However, the proportion of Bacteroidetes organisms was greater in alfalfa pellet-induced SARA than in mild or severe grain-induced SARA (35.4% versus 26.0% and 16.6%, respectively). This shift was also evident from the real-time PCR data for Prevotella albensis, Prevotella brevis, and Prevotella ruminicola, which are members of the Bacteroidetes. The real-time PCR data also indicated that severe grain-induced SARA was dominated by Streptococcus bovis and Escherichia coli, whereas mild grain-induced SARA was dominated by Megasphaera elsdenii and alfalfa pellet-induced SARA was dominated by P. albensis. Using discriminant analysis, the severity of SARA and degree of inflammation were highly correlated with the abundance of E. coli and not with lipopolysaccharide in the rumen. We thus suspect that E. coli may be a contributing factor in disease onset.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis bacteremia related to colon adenoma in a chronic hemodialysis patient.
AB  - Abstract We report the case of a 54-year-old hemodialysis patient who presented with recurrent fever due to Streptococcus bovis bacteremia related to colonic tubulovillous adenoma. Following polypectomy and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, the patient totally recovered. In this paper, we discussed the relation between S. bovis bacteremia, colonic adenomas, and hemodialysis. Awareness of this association is critical for early diagnosis and management.
TI  - Surface-exposed histone-like protein a modulates adherence of Streptococcus gallolyticus to colon adenocarcinoma cells.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly known as Streptococcus bovis biotype I) is a low-grade opportunistic pathogen which is considered to be associated with colon cancer. It is thought that colon polyps or tumors are the main portal of entry for this bacterium and that heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) at the colon tumor cell surface are involved in bacterial adherence during the first stages of infection. In this study, we have shown that the histone-like protein A (HlpA) of S. gallolyticus is a genuine anchorless bacterial surface protein that binds to lipoteichoic acid (LTA) of the gram-positive cell wall in a growth phase-dependent manner. In addition, HlpA was shown to be one of the major heparin-binding proteins of S. gallolyticus able to bind to the HSPG-expressing colon tumor cell lines HCT116 and HT-29. Strikingly, although wild-type levels of HlpA appeared to contribute to adherence, coating of additional HlpA at the bacterial surface resulted in reduced binding to colon tumor cells. This may be explained by the fact that heparan sulfate and LTA compete for the same binding site in HlpA. Altogether, this study implies that HlpA serves as a fine-tuning factor for bacterial adherence.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of streptococci isolated from mastitic bovine milk samples in Korea.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial resistance of streptococci isolated from mastitic bovine milk samples. A total of 178 isolates belonging to 6 different Streptococcus species were examined: S. uberis (n = 99), S. bovis (n = 30), S. oralis (n = 24), S. salivarius (n = 13), S. intermedius (n = 7), and S. agalactiae (n = 5). Only 8.9% (16/178) of the isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents tested in this study, and S. agalactiae and S. intermedius isolates were all resistant to at least 1 antimicrobial agent tested. Overall, the most frequently observed resistance was to tetracycline (61.2%), followed by lincomycin (43.2%), gentamycin (35.3%), oxacillin (34.3%), and erythromycin (28.6%). Cephalothin and penicillin were the only antimicrobial agents to which most of the streptococci (>or=92%) were susceptible. Wide differences in the prevalence of resistance are apparent among the individual species: S. salivarius displayed exceptionally high resistance to cephalothin (23.0%) and oxacillin (76.9%) and S. agalactiae (20%) and S. intermedius (14.2%) to penicillin. Streptococcus salivarius and S. agalactiae were all susceptible to erythromycin, but others showed various rates of resistance ranging from 12.5% to 42.8%. Resistance to 3 or more of 7 antimicrobial agents was observed in all species (37.6%, 67/178).

TI  - A collagen-binding adhesin, Acb, and ten other putative MSCRAMM and pilus family  proteins of Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (Streptococcus bovis Group, biotype I).
AB  - Members of the Streptococcus bovis group are important causes of endocarditis. However, factors associated with their pathogenicity, such as adhesins, remain uncharacterized. We recently demonstrated that endocarditis-derived Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus isolates frequently adhere to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Here, we generated a draft genome sequence of an ECM protein-adherent S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strain and found, by genome-wide analyses, 11 predicted LPXTG-type cell wall-anchored proteins with characteristics of MSCRAMMs, including a modular architecture of domains predicted to adopt immunoglobulin (Ig)-like folding. A recombinant segment of one of these, Acb, showed high-affinity binding to immobilized collagen, and cell surface expression of Acb correlated with the presence of acb and collagen adherence of isolates. Three of the 11 proteins have similarities to major pilus subunits and are organized in separate clusters, each including a second Ig-fold-containing MSCRAMM and a class C sortase, suggesting that the sequenced strain encodes three distinct types of pili. Reverse transcription-PCR demonstrated that all three genes of one cluster, acb-sbs7-srtC1, are cotranscribed, consistent with pilus operons of other gram-positive bacteria. Further analysis detected expression of all 11 genes in cells grown to mid to late exponential growth phases. Wide distribution of 9 of the 11 genes was observed among S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus isolates with fewer genes present in other S. bovis group species/subspecies. The high prevalence of genes encoding putative MSCRAMMs and pili, including a collagen-binding MSCRAMM, among S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus isolates may play an important role in the predominance of this subspecies in S. bovis endocarditis.
TI  - Evidence-based semiquantitative methodology for prioritization of foodborne zoonoses.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To prioritize an extended list of food- and water-borne zoonoses to allow food safety authorities to focus on the most relevant hazards in the food chain. METHODS: An evidence-based semiquantitative methodology was developed. Scores were given by 35 scientific experts in the field of animal and public health, food, and clinical microbiology and epidemiology to 51 zoonotic agents according to five criteria related to public health (severity and occurrence in humans), animal health (severity of disease coupled with economic consequences and occurrence in animals), and food (occurrence in food). The scoring procedure was standardized and evidence-based as experts were provided, for each zoonotic agent, a same set of up-to-date help information data related to the five criteria. Independently, the relative importance of the five criteria was weighted by seven food chain risk managers. The zoonotic agents were ranked based on overall weighted scores and were grouped in four statistically different levels of importance. RESULTS: The following foodborne zoonotic pathogens were classified as "most important": Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli. A second group of "significant importance" included Toxoplasma gondii, the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, Clostridium botulinum, Staphylococcus aureus, Cryptosporidium parvum, Mycobacterium bovis, Echinococcus granulosus, Streptococcus spp., Echinococcus multilocularis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Mycobacterium avium, Fasciola hepatica, Giardia intestinalis, and Rotavirus. CONCLUSIONS: This methodology allowed to rank 51 zoonotic agents with objectivity and taking account of a combined input from risk assessors and risk managers. APPLICATIONS: These results support food safety policy makers to establish the multiannual monitoring program of foodborne zoonoses. They also enable to identify knowledge gaps on specific zoonotic agents and to formulate key research questions. Principally, this method of prioritization is of general interest as it can be applied for any other ranking exercise and in any country.

TI  - [Novel clinical and epidemiologic trends in elderly infective endocarditis].
AB  - The age of peak incidence of infective endocarditis (IE) has shifted from 45 years in the 50's to 70 years at the present time. Elderly persons carry a five times higher risk of IE than the general adult population. Factors accounting for this phenomenon include increased use of invasive procedures and implanted medical devices as well as a higher prevalence of degenerative valve disease. In the elderly, IE onset may be insidious, often masked by one or more underlying conditions such as cancer, diabetes and chronic organ failure, hence the diagnosis may be delayed. The leading pathogen is Staphylococcus aureus, more frequently methicillin-resistant, although Streptococcus bovis and enterococci are gaining prevalence. Vascular phenomena and embolic events are less common in the elderly, probably due to a lessened acute phase response and a larger use of antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs. Because of diminished renal clearance, antibiotics should be carefully titrated in aged IE patients. Cardiac surgery is performed less often in elderly IE due to poor preoperative conditions. Indeed, both these factors may account for the higher mortality rate, that is twice that of younger IE patients. Notwithstanding, age > or = 65 years has been found to be an independent predictor of mortality. Prophylactic measures residing mostly on the prevention of health-care associated acquisition need to be more widely implemented in this growing subgroup of IE patients.
TI  - Novel strategy for yeast construction using delta-integration and cell fusion to  efficiently produce ethanol from raw starch.
AB  - We developed a novel strategy for constructing yeast to improve levels of amylase gene expression and the practical potential of yeast by combining delta-integration and polyploidization through cell fusion. Streptococcus bovis alpha-amylase and Rhizopus oryzae glucoamylase/alpha-agglutinin fusion protein genes were integrated into haploid yeast strains. Diploid strains were constructed from these haploid strains by mating, and then a tetraploid strain was constructed by cell fusion. The alpha-amylase and glucoamylase activities of the tetraploid strain were increased up to 1.5- and tenfold, respectively, compared with the parental strain. The diploid and tetraploid strains proliferated faster, yielded more cells, and fermented glucose more effectively than the haploid strain. Ethanol productivity from raw starch was improved with increased ploidy; the tetraploid strain consumed 150 g/l of raw starch and produced 70 g/l of ethanol after 72 h of fermentation. Our strategy for constructing yeasts resulted in the simultaneous overexpression of genes integrated into the genome and improvements in the practical potential of yeasts.

Characterization of SPH was done by FT-IR, TGA, SEM, HPC and GCMS. The effects of pH and salinity on the swelling aptitude of the SPH were investigated along with its degradability in Streptococcus bovis medium.
TI  - Production of bacteriocins by Streptococcus bovis strains from Australian ruminants.
AB  - AIMS: To examine the prevalence of bacteriocin production in Streptococcus bovis  isolates from Australian ruminants and the feasibility of industrial production of bacteriocin. METHODS AND RESULTS: Streptococcus bovis strains were tested for production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (BLIS) by antagonism assay against Lactococcus lactis. BLIS production was associated with source animal location (i.e. proximity of other bacteriocin-positive source animals) rather than ruminant species/breed or diet. One bacteriocin showing strong inhibitory activity (Sb15) was isolated and examined. Protein sequence, stability and activity spectrum of this bovicin were very similar to bovicin HC5. Production could be increased through serial culturing, and increased productivity could be partially maintained during cold storage of cultures. CONCLUSIONS: BLIS production is geographically widely distributed in Eastern Australia, and it appears that the bacteriocin(+) trait is maintained in animals at the same location. The HC5-like bacteriocin, originally identified in North America, is also found in Australia. Production of bacteriocin can be increased through serial culturing. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The HC5-like bacteriocins appear to have a broad global distribution. Serial culturing may provide a route towards commercial manufacturing for use in industrial applications, and purified bacteriocin from S. bovis Sb15 could potentially be used to prevent food spoilage or as a feed additive to promote growth in ruminant species.
TI  - Effects of dietary changes and yeast culture (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) on rumen  microbial fermentation of Holstein heifers.
AB  - The effects of a dietary challenge to induce digestive upsets and supplementation with yeast culture on rumen microbial fermentation were studied using 12 Holstein heifers (277 +/- 28 kg of BW) fitted with a ruminal cannula, in a crossover design with 2 periods of 5 wk. In each period, after 3 wk of adaptation to a 100% forage diet, the dietary challenge consisted of increasing the amount of grain at a rate of 2.5 kg/d (as-fed basis) over a period of 4 d, until a 10:90 forage:concentrate diet was reached, and then it was maintained for 10 d. Between periods, animals were fed again the 100% forage diet without any treatment for 1 wk as a wash-out period. Treatments started the first day of each period, and they were a control diet (CL) or the same diet with addition of yeast culture (YC, Diamond V XPCLS). Digestive upsets were determined by visual observation of bloat or by a reduction in feed intake (as-fed basis) of 50% or more compared with intake on the previous day. Feed intake was determined daily at 24-h intervals during the adaptation period and daily at 2, 6, and 12 h postfeeding during the dietary challenge. Ruminal liquid samples were collected daily during the dietary challenge to determine ruminal pH at 0, 3, 6, and 12 h postfeeding, and total and individual VFA, lactic acid, ammonia-N, and rumen fluid viscosity at 0 and 6 h postfeeding. The 16s rRNA gene copies of Streptococcus bovis and Megasphaera elsdenii were determined by quantitative PCR. Foam height and strength of the rumen fluid were also determined the day after the digestive upset to evaluate potential foam production. A total of 20 cases (83.3%) of digestive upsets were recorded in both periods during the dietary challenge, all diagnosed due to a reduction in feed intake. Rumen fermentation profile at 0 h on the digestive upset day was characterized by low ruminal pH, which remained under 6.0 for 18 h, accompanied by elevated total VFA concentration and, in some cases, by elevated lactate concentration. Addition of YC during the dietary challenge did not affect the incidence (10 cases per treatment) or time (7.00 +/- 0.62 d) to digestive upset. However, YC reduced (P < 0.05) the foam strength on the day after digestive upset, suggesting potential benefits of reducing the risk of developing bloat. The proposed dietary challenge model was successful in causing a digestive upset as indicated by reduced feed intake, but the YC addition had no significant impact on rumen fermentation.
TI  - Pathogen detection in milk samples by ligation detection reaction-mediated universal array method.
AB  - This paper describes a new DNA chip, based on the use of a ligation detection reaction coupled to a universal array, developed to detect and analyze, directly from milk samples, microbial pathogens known to cause bovine, ovine, and caprine mastitis or to be responsible for foodborne intoxication or infection, or both. Probes were designed for the identification of 15 different bacterial groups: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, nonaureus staphylococci, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus canis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus parauberis, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycoplasma spp., Salmonella spp., Bacillus spp., Campylobacter spp., and Escherichia coli and related species. These groups were identified based on the 16S rRNA gene. For microarray validation, 22 strains from the American Type Culture Collection or other culture collections and 50 milk samples were tested. The results demonstrated high specificity, with sensitivity as low as 6 fmol. Moreover, the ligation detection reaction-universal array assay allowed for the identification of Mycoplasma spp. in a few hours, avoiding the long incubation times of traditional microbiological identification methods. The universal array described here is a versatile tool able to identify milk pathogens efficiently and rapidly.

TI  - Real-time polymerase chain reaction-based identification of bacteria in milk samples from bovine clinical mastitis with no growth in conventional culturing.
AB  - In more than 30% of milk samples from clinical and subclinical bovine mastitis, bacteria fail to grow even after 48 h of conventional culture. The "no-growth" samples are problematic for mastitis laboratories, veterinarians, and dairy producers. This study provides the first investigation of the bacteriological etiology of such samples, using a real-time PCR-based commercial reagent kit. The assay targets the DNA of the 11 most common bacterial species or groups in mastitis and the staphylococcal blaZ gene (responsible for penicillin resistance) and can identify and quantify bacterial cells even if dead or growth-inhibited. A study was made of 79 mastitic milk samples with no-growth bacteria in conventional culture, originating from cows with clinical mastitis. Of the 79 samples, 34 (43%) were positive for 1 (32 samples) or 2 (2 samples) of the target bacteria. The positive findings included 11 Staphylococcus spp. (staphylococci other than Staphylococcus aureus), 10 Streptococcus uberis, 2 Streptococcus dysgalactiae, 6 Corynebacterium bovis, 3 Staph. aureus, 1 Escherichia coli, 1 Enterococcus, and 1 Arcanobacterium pyogenes. The positive samples contained as many as 10(3) to 10(7) bacterial genome copies per milliliter of milk. This study demonstrates that in nearly half of the clinical mastitis cases in which conventional culture failed to detect bacteria, mastitis pathogens were still present, often in substantial quantities. The clearly elevated N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase activity values of the milk samples, together with clinical signs of the infected cows and quarters, confirmed the diagnosis of clinical mastitis and indicated that real-time, PCR-based bacterial findings are able to reveal bacteriological etiology. We conclude that all common mastitis bacteria can occur in large quantities in clinical mastitis samples that exhibit no growth in conventional culture, and that the real-time PCR assay is a useful tool for bacteriological diagnosis of such milk samples. Low bacterial concentration is commonly speculated to explain the no-growth milk samples. This hypothesis is not supported by the results of the current study.
TI  - Development of novel cell surface display in Corynebacterium glutamicum using porin.
AB  - We have developed a novel cell surface display in Corynebacterium glutamicum using porin proteins as anchor proteins. Porins are localized at C. glutamicum mycolic acid layer and exist as a hexamer. We used alpha-amylase from Streptococcus bovis 148 (AmyA) as a model protein to be displayed on the C. glutamicum cell surface. AmyA was fused to the C terminus of the porins PorB, PorC, or PorH. Expression vectors using fused proteins under the control of the cspB promoter were constructed and introduced into the C. glutamicum Cm strain. Immunostaining microscopy and flow cytometric analysis revealed that PorB-AmyA, PorC-AmyA, and PorH-AmyA were displayed on the C. glutamicum cell surface. AmyA activity was only detected in the cell fraction of C. glutamicum cells that displayed AmyA fused to PorB, PorC or PorH and AmyA activity was not detected in the supernatants of C. glutamicum culture broths after 72 h cultivation. Thus, we have demonstrated that C. glutamicum porins are very efficient anchor proteins for protein display in C. glutamicum.
TI  - The clinical importance of microbiological findings in the diagnosis and management of bloodstream infections.
AB  - Bloodstream infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Accurate identification of blood isolates to the species level and identification of the source of infection and/or the portal of entry are crucial for optimal management of these infections. These investigations-in addition to clinical findings and laboratory and imaging studies-are central to informing and directing efficient and effective diagnostic examinations and to choosing the optimal antimicrobial regimen. Four case studies that demonstrate the importance of identifying the causative agents and the source of infection are discussed to illustrate the central importance of microbiological findings in the diagnosis of bacteremia and bloodstream infections associated with infections at other sites.
TI  - A pyogenic discitis at c3-c4 with associated ventral epidural abscess involving c1-c4 after intradiscal oxygen-ozone chemonucleolysis: a case report.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A case report and clinical discussion. OBJECTIVE: To describe an unique case of purulent discitis at C3-C4 and an anterior C1-C4 epidural abscess secondary to oxygen-ozone therapy for the herniated cervical discs. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Previously reported complications secondary to ozone therapy are rarely documented. No cases of pyogenic discitis with associated epidural abscess after oxygen-ozone therapy have been reported to date. To our knowledge, this is the first such case reported in literature. METHODS: A 57-year-old female patient with nuchal stiffness was previously treated with ozone therapy at the discs of C3-C4, C4-C5, and C6-C7. Five days later, she presented with an attack of neck pain and fever followed by progressive quadriplegia with sudden onset of dyspnea and was referred to our hospital. On admission, physical examination revealed a temperature of 38.8 degrees C, evident neck tenderness, marked global weakness (grade 1-2/5 MRC) in bilateral upper-limb, and a modest global weakness in bilateral lower-limb (grade 4/5 MRC). Laboratory findings showed a significantly elevated WCC, ESR, and CRP. Blood culture was negative. Enhanced-MR imaging demonstrated a purulent discitis at C3-C4 and a ventral C1-C4 epidural abscess with homogenous enhancement indicative of a solid phlegmonous granulation tissue. RESULTS: We formulated a 3-stage treatment involving C1-C4 multilevel decompressive laminectomies, subtotal unilateral C3-C4 facetectomies, and tissue sampling for culture with application of a corset after surgery, followed by a delayed secondary posterior thorough drainage of epidural liquid pus using a suction-irrigation drainage, after the abscess had turned to a necrotic liquid abscess, on the basis of findings of enhanced-MR imaging, by 10-day duration of intravenously antibiotic therapy tailored to Streptococcus bovis isolated from infected tissue. Over the next few weeks, the patient made an excellent neurologic recovery. However, she did not consent to undergo further occipitocervical fusion until the follow-up MR imaging at 8 months demonstrated postlaminectomy kyphosis. After surgery, the patient remained clinically satisfactory in neurology without evidence of a recurrence of spinal infection. A slight improvement in the cervical spine curve was demonstrated in the follow-up radiograph at nearly 4-month postoccipitocervical fusion. CONCLUSION: This case report illustrates a rare but life-threatening complication of oxygen-ozone therapy for the cervical disc herniation. Infection is a common risk for any invasive spinal techniques involving puncture, so attention should be paid to the sterility during the procedures. A high index of suspicion along with reliance on enhanced-MRI is essential to diagnose the condition and institute appropriate treatment on an individual basis.
TI  - Bronchoalveolar lavage cytology from captive badgers.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid is evaluated for the diagnosis and study of lung disease and airway inflammation. Cytologic profiles for BAL fluid have not been reported for badgers and may be useful in understanding the pathogenesis of pulmonary diseases such as Mycobacterium bovis. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate cytologic and microbial findings in BAL fluid from captive European badgers (Meles meles) and identify correlates with the results of concurrently collected blood and fecal samples. METHODS: BAL fluid (by a nonbronchoscopic method) and jugular venous blood samples (for routine CBC) were obtained from 23 captive tuberculosis-free anesthetized badgers on 2 occasions 4 weeks apart. Fecal samples were collected for routine parasitology. Morphologic evaluation and 100-cell differentials were done on cytocentrifuged BAL specimens. Pellets from centrifuged BAL were aerobically cultured for bacteria. RESULTS: With the 2 BAL samples from each of the 23 badgers combined, the median (range) cell percentages were 73.0% (5-95%) neutrophils, 7.5% (2-16%) macrophages, 8.0% (0-27%) lymphocytes, and 9.5% (0-92%) eosinophils. Macrophages frequently contained silica-like crystals. Other findings included ciliated epithelial cells, goblet cells, mucus, and Aelurostrongylus sp. larvae. A light growth of Streptococcus, Pasteurella, or Escherichia coli was cultured in 6 badgers. Trypanosoma pestanai were identified in blood from 10 badgers and fecal parasites (mainly coccidia) were found in 20 badgers. No correlation was found between BAL and CBC results and the presence of parasites. CONCLUSIONS: The predominance of neutrophils in BAL fluid from badgers differs from the predominance of macrophages found in BAL from other species. This difference may reflect the burrowing lifestyle or the unique immune response of badgers.
TI  - Association of Streptococcus pluranimalium with valvular endocarditis and septicaemia in adult broiler parents.
AB  - The genus Streptococcus consists of more than 60 species, but only Streptococcus  equi subspecies zooepidemicus, Streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus, Streptococcus gallinaceus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus suis have been isolated from poultry. During investigations of the aetiology of increased mortality in broiler parent stock at the end of production, pure cultures of streptococcal-like organisms that could not be classified among these six species were obtained from 24 cases of septicaemia or valvular endocarditis and septicaemia. Phenotypic characterization using the API20 STREP kit identified the isolates as Aerococcus viridans (10), Aerococcus urinae (2), Leuconostoc species (4), Streptococcus salivarius (2), Streptococcus bovis II 3 (1), Enterococcus avium (3), Enterococcus faecium (1) or Gemella morbillorum (1). However, this identification was misleading as subsequent genetic investigations using pulse field gel electrophoresis and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes showed that 19 isolates were classified as Streptococcus pluranimalium, while the remaining isolates were E. avium (3), E. faecium (1) or Lactobacillus species (1). Misidentification by API20 STREP was related to the database provided by the manufacturer, as the phenotypic characteristics could identify these organisms as S. pluranimalium. The isolates of S. pluranimalium belonged to at least three different clones as determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis of SmaI-digested genomic DNA. The capacity that these isolates had to colonize the valvular endothelium was suggested by the occurrence of valvular endocarditis in 12 of 19 cases. Demonstration of the same clone in all four houses on a farm suggested the pathogenic potential of this organism.
TI  - The effect of carbon and nitrogen sources on bovicin HC5 production by Streptococcus bovis HC5.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the effect of media composition and agroindustrial residues  on bovicin HC5 production by Streptococcus bovis HC5. METHODS AND RESULTS: Batch cultures of S. bovis HC5 were grown in basal medium containing different carbon and nitrogen sources. The activity of cell-free and cell-associated bovicin HC5 was determined in culture supernatants and acidic extracts obtained from cell pellets, respectively. Streptococcus bovis HC5 produced bovicin using a variety of carbon and nitrogen sources. The highest specific activity was obtained in media containing 16 g l(-1) of glucose, after 16 h of incubation. The peak in cell-free and cell-associated bovicin HC5 activity was detected when S. bovis HC5 cultures reached stationary phase. The bovicin HC5 specific activity and bacterial cell mass increased approximately 3-fold when yeast extract and trypticase (0.5 and 1.0 g l(-1), respectively) were added together to the basal medium. Streptococcus bovis HC5 cultures produced bovicin HC5 in cheese whey and sugar cane juice and maximal volumetric productivity was obtained after 12 h of incubation. CONCLUSIONS: Streptococcus bovis HC5 is a versatile lactic acid bacterium that can utilize several carbon and nitrogen sources for bovicin HC5 production. This bacterium could be a useful model to study bacteriocin production in the rumen ecosystem. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The use of agroindustrial residues as carbon sources could have an economical impact on bovicin HC5 production. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show the use of sugar cane juice for bacteriocin production by lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Aorto-pulmonary fistula as a late complication of multiple valve replacement after Streptococcus Bovis endocarditis in a patient with occult colon carcinoma.
AB  - We report a case of aorto-pulmonary fistula following multiple valve surgery in a patient with colon carcinoma who had had recurrent episodes of Streptococcus Bovis endocarditis. Diagnosis was made by transesophageal echocardiography and aortography. Patient underwent emergency percutaneous implantation of an aortic endoprosthesis, but he continued to deteriorate and the fatal outcome could not be changed. This case underscores the importance of examination of gastrointestinal tract in patients with Streptococcus Bovis endocarditis.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis endocarditis, a silent sign for colonic tumour.
AB  - AIM: An association between colonic carcinoma and Streptococcus bovis endocarditis/bacteraemia was first suggested in 1951. This knowledge has great clinical implications, yet we found scant awareness amongst general surgical trainees. The aim of this article was to review the evidence available in the literature and explore the pathophysiology behind this association. METHOD: The literature was reviewed, between 1950 and 2008, using Pubmed, Embase and Ovid database searches. We utilized different combinations of the keywords: Streptococcus bovis, endocarditis, septicaemia and colon cancer/carcinoma. Quality assessment was determined using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine Levels of Evidence (May 2001). Studies were selected based on their relevance to the aims to be addressed. RESULTS: We included nine case reports and found 24 studies demonstrating an association between S. bovis bacteraemia/endocarditis and colon cancer; the reported incidence in studies was variable (6-67%). The majority of studies (20) were retrospective analysis of data; only four studies were prospective. A total of 12 of 24 studies also reported an association with extra-colonic malignancy (1-22%) and 12 with liver disease (3-57%). Eight studies relevant to the pathophysiology of this association were identified. CONCLUSION: Streptococcus bovis endocarditis and/or bacteraemia is an early clue to the likely presence of colorectal cancer. Whilst further studies are required to determine the precise pathophysiology, clinicians should be aware of this association. It is advisable to investigate rigorously for colon cancer in all patients presenting with S. bovis endocarditis/bacteraemia; such patients may also present with liver disease or, occasionally, extra-colonic malignancy.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of five herbal extracts against multi drug resistant (MDR) strains of bacteria and fungus of clinical origin.
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of the crude ethanolic extracts of five plants were screened against multidrug resistant (MDR) strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans. ATCC strains of Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus bovis, Pseudimonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans were also tested. The strains that showed resistance against the maximum number of antibiotics tested were selected for an antibacterial assay. The MDR strains were sensitive to the antimicrobial activity of Acacia nilotica, Syzygium aromaticum and Cinnamum zeylanicum, whereas they exhibited strong resistance to the extracts of Terminalia arjuna and Eucalyptus globulus. Community-acquired infections showed higher sensitivity than the nosocomial infections against these extracts. The most potent antimicrobial plant was A. nilotica (MIC range 9.75-313 microg/ml), whereas other crude plant extracts studied in this report were found to exhibit higher MIC values than A. nilotica against community acquired as well as nosocomial infection. This study concludes that A. nilotica, C. zeylanicum and S. aromaticum can be used against multidrug resistant microbes causing nosocomial and community acquired infections.
TI  - Physiological changes in rumen fermentation during acidosis induction and its control using a multivalent polyclonal antibody preparation in heifers.
AB  - Physiological changes in rumen fermentation during acidosis induction and its control using a multivalent polyclonal antibody preparation (PAP) were studied in a completely randomized experiment using 12 crossbred heifers (452 +/- 20 kg of BW). Treatments were control (CTR) or PAP. The acidosis induction protocol consisted of 3 periods: 3 mo of 100% fescue hay fed for ad libitum intake, 10 d (from d 1 to 10 of the experiment) of adaptation to the treatment (100% forage feeding + 10 mL/d of PAP top-dressed to the treatment group), and 5 d (from d 11 to 15 of the experiment) of transition, which consisted of increasing the concentrate (16.5% CP) 2.5 kg/d up to 12.5 kg/d while maintaining ad libitum intake of fescue and providing 10 mL/d of PAP to the treated heifers. Concentrate feeding of 12.5 kg/d was maintained until heifers developed acidosis (from d 16 to 22 of the experiment). When an animal was considered acidotic, it was changed to a 50:50 forage:concentrate diet, monitored for 4 d, and removed from the experiment. Samples of ruminal fluid were collected before and 6 h after feeding to determine pH, VFA, lactate, protozoa counts, and DNA extraction for quantitative real-time PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analyses. Only samples collected during adaptation to the treatment, at 3 and 1 d before acidosis, on the acidosis day, and at 1 and 4 d after acidosis were analyzed. Differences were declared at P < 0.05. Heifers (83% for CTR, and 50% for PAP) entered into acidosis 5.25 +/- 0.17 d after the beginning of the transition. The fermentation profile of animals with acidosis was similar between treatments. From 3 d before acidosis to acidosis day, decreases in pH and in acetate-to-propionate ratio and increases in total VFA, butyrate, and entodiniomorph counts were observed. However, the greatest concentrations of Streptococcus bovis and Megasphaera elsdenii (79 +/- 54 and 104 +/- 73 ng of DNA/mL of ruminal fluid, respectively) and a decrease in DMI (10.6 vs. 6.46 kg, respectively) were recorded 1 d after acidosis. Compared with CTR heifers, heifers fed PAP had greater pH before feeding on d 6 (6.70 vs. 6.11), 8 (6.54 vs. 5.95), and 9 (7.26 vs. 6.59) after the beginning of the feeding challenge. Heifers fed PAP tended to have greater total VFA concentrations than CTR (124 and 114 +/- 4.0 mM, respectively). These results indicate that PAP may be effective in controlling acidosis of heifers during a rapid transition to a high-concentrate diet.
TI  - Characteristics of the bovicin HJ50 gene cluster in Streptococcus bovis HJ50.
AB  - Bovicin HJ50 is a new lantibiotic containing a disulfide bridge produced by Streptococcus bovis HJ50; its encoding gene bovA was reported in our previous publication. To identify other genes involved in bovicin HJ50 production, DNA fragments flanking bovA were cloned and sequenced. The bovicin HJ50 biosynthesis gene locus was encoded by a 9.9 kb region of chromosomal DNA and consisted of at least nine genes in the following order: bovA, -M, -T, -E, -F, ORF1, ORF2, bovK and bovR. A thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase gene named sdb1 was located downstream of bovR. A knockout mutant of this gene retained antimicrobial activity and the molecular mass of bovicin HJ50 in the mutant was the same as that of bovicin HJ50 in S. bovis HJ50, implying that sdb1 is not involved in bovicin HJ50 production. Transcriptional analyses showed that bovA, bovM and bovT constituted an operon, and the transcription start site of the bovA promoter was located at a G residue 45 bp upstream of the translation start codon for bovA, while bovE through bovR were transcribed together and the transcription start site of the bovE promoter was located at a C residue 35 bp upstream of bovE. We also demonstrated successful heterologous expression of bovicin HJ50 in Lactococcus lactis MG1363, which lacks thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase genes; this showed that thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase genes other than sdb1 are not essential for bovicin HJ50 biosynthesis.
TI  - Bovicin HC5 inhibits wasteful amino acid degradation by mixed ruminal bacteria in vitro.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis HC5 produces a broad spectrum lantibiotic (bovicin HC5) that  inhibits pure cultures of hyper ammonia-producing bacteria (HAB). Experiments were preformed to see if: (1) S. bovis HC5 cells could inhibit the deamination of amino acids by mixed ruminal bacteria taken directly from a cow, (2) semi-purified bovicin was as effective as S. bovis HC5 cells, and 3) semi-purified and the feed additive monensin were affecting the same types of ammonia-producing ruminal bacteria. Because purified and semi-purified bovicin HC5 was as effective as S. bovis HC5 cells, it appeared that bovicin HC5 was penetrating the cell membranes of HAB before it could be degraded by peptidases and proteinases. Mixed ruminal bacteria that were successively transferred and enriched nine times with trypticase did not become significantly more resistant to either bovicin HC5 (50 AU mL(-1)) or monensin (5 microM), and amplified rDNA restriction analysis indicated that bovicin HC5 and monensin appeared to be selecting against the same types of bacteria.
TI  - Association between Streptococcus bovis and colon cancer.
AB  
TI  - The ability of non-bacteriocin producing Streptococcus bovis strains to bind and  transfer bovicin HC5 to other sensitive bacteria.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis HC5 produces a broad spectrum lantibiotic (bovicin HC5), but  S. bovis JB1 does not have antimicrobial activity. Preliminary experiments revealed an anomaly. When S. bovis JB1 cells were washed in stationary phase S. bovis HC5 cell-free culture supernatant, the S. bovis JB1 cells were subsequently able to inhibit hyper-ammonia producing ruminal bacteria (Clostridium sticklandii, Clostridium aminophilum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius). Other non-bacteriocin producing S. bovis strains also had the ability to bind and transfer semi-purified bovicin HC5. Bovicin HC5 that was bound to S. bovis JB1 was much more resistant to Pronase E than cell-free bovicin HC5, but it could be inactivated if the incubation period was 24 h. Acidic NaCl treatment (100 mM, pH 2.0) liberates half of the bovicin HC5 from S. bovis HC5, but it did not prevent bovicin HC5 from binding to S. bovis JB1. Acidic NaCl liberated some bovicin HC5 from S. bovis JB1, but the decrease in activity was only 2-fold. Bovicin HC5 is a positively charged peptide, and the ability of S. bovis JB1 to bind bovicin HC5 could be inhibited by either calcium or magnesium (100 mM). Acidic NaCl-treated S. bovis JB1 cells were unable to accumulate potassium, but they were still able to bind bovicin HC5 and prevent potassium accumulation by untreated S. bovis JB1 cells. Based on these results, bovicin HC5 bound to S. bovis JB1 cells still acts as a pore-forming lantibiotic.
TI  - Lactobacillus casei secreting alpha-MSH induces the therapeutic effect on DSS-induced acute colitis in Balb/c Mice.
AB  - The neuropeptide alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha- MSH) has anti-inflammatory property by downregulating the expressions of proinflammatory cytokines. Because alpha-MSH elicits the anti-inflammatory effect in various inflammatory disease models, we examined the therapeutic effect of oral administration of recombinant Lactobacillus casei, which secretes alpha-MSH (L. casei-alpha-MSH), on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in Balb/c mice. Thus, we constructed the alpha-MSH-secreting Lactobacillus casei by the basic plasmid, pLUAT-ss, which was composed of a PldhUTLS promoter and alpha-amylase signal sequence from Streptococcus bovis strain. Acute colitis was induced by oral administration of 5% DSS in drinking water for 7 days. To investigate the effect of L. casei-alpha-MSH on the colitis, L. casei or L. casei-alpha-MSH was orally administered for 7 days and their effects on body weight, mortality rate, cytokine production, and tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were observed. Administration of L. casei-alpha-MSH reduced the symptom of acute colitis as assessed by body weight loss (DSS alone: 14.45+/-0. 2 g; L. casei-alpha- MSH: 18.2+/-0.12 g), colitis score (DSS alone: 3.6+/-0.4; L. casei-alpha-MSH: 1.4+/-0.6), MPO activity (DSS alone: 42.7+/-4.5 U/g; L. casei-alpha-MSH: 10.25+/-0.5 U/g), survival rate, and histological damage compared with the DSS alone mice. L. casei-alpha-MSH-administered entire colon showed reduced in vitro production of proinflammatory cytokines and NF-kappaB activation. The alpha-MSH-secreting recombinant L. casei showed significant anti-inflammatory effects in the murine model of acute colitis and suggests a potential therapeutic role for this agent in clinical inflammatory bowel diseases.
TI  - Ecology and pathogenicity of gastrointestinal Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis is an indigenous resident in the gastrointestinal tracts of both humans and animals. S. bovis is one of the major causes of bacterial endocarditis and has been implicated in the incidence of human colon cancer, possibly due to chronic inflammatory response at the site of intestinal colonization. Certain feeding regimens in ruminants can lead to overgrowth of S. bovis in the rumen, resulting in the over-production of lactate and capsular polysaccharide causing acute ruminal acidosis and bloat, respectively. There are multiple strategies in controlling acute lactic acidosis and bloat. The incidence of the two diseases may be controlled by strict dietary management. Gradual introduction of grain-based diets and the feeding of coarsely chopped roughage decrease the incidence of the two disease entities. Ionophores, which have been used to enhance feed conversion and growth rate in cattle, have been shown to inhibit the growth of lactic acid bacteria in the rumen. Other methods of controlling lactic acid bacteria in the ruminal environment (dietary supplementation of long-chain fatty acids, induction of passive and active immune responses to the bacteria, and the use of lytic bacteriophages) have also been investigated. It is anticipated that through continued in-depth ecological analysis of S. bovis the characteristics responsible for human and animal pathogenesis would be sufficiently identified to a point where more effective control strategies for the control of this bacteria can be developed.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis causing perforating corneal ulcer.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to report the first case of Streptococcus  bovis causing a perforating corneal ulcer in a healthy adult. METHODS: Observational case report. RESULTS: A healthy 77-year-old man presented with rapidly progressing corneal ulcer, resulting in perforation within 4 days. Preoperative and operative cultures isolated the same organism, S. bovis, susceptible only to vancomycin and ceftriaxone. The patient underwent a successful corneal transplantation, with histopathology revealing full-thickness necrosis and scattered bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Although a rare pathogen in ocular infections, we report a case of devastating corneal infection caused by S. bovis and highlight consideration of this pathogen in rapidly progressing corneal ulcers.
TI  - Adherence characteristics of endocarditis-derived Streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus (Streptococcus bovis biotype I) isolates to host extracellular matrix proteins.
AB  - Members of the Streptococcus bovis group are frequent colonizers of the intestinal tract, which can also cause endocarditis. However, their ability to adhere to and colonize host tissues and the factors associated with pathogenicity are largely unknown. Here, we assessed 17 endocarditis-derived human isolates [identified here as 15 Streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus (S. bovis biotype I), one S. gallolyticus ssp. pasteurianus (biotype II/2) and one Streptococcus infantarius ssp. coli (biotype II/1)] for their in vitro adherence to components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Adherence to collagen type I was found to be the most common phenotype exhibited by 76% of isolates, followed by collagen type IV (53%), fibrinogen (47%), collagen type V (35%) and fibronectin (35%). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analyses showed that >50% of endocarditis-derived S. gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus isolates are genetically diverse, although two clusters of two and four isolates were observed. The diversity of strains and differences observed in adherence characteristics to distinct host ECM proteins suggest that isolates of S. gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus produce different surface components, similar to other gram-positive pathogens, to colonize the host and cause infection.
TI  - Screening of surface properties and antagonistic substances production by lactic  acid bacteria isolated from the mammary gland of healthy and mastitic cows.
AB  - Bovine mastitis (BM) is a costly disease in dairy cattle production. The prevention and treatment of mastitis is performed by applying antimicrobial products that negatively affect milk quality. In the last years, the use of probiotic microorganisms to prevent infections in humans and animals has being aggressively studied. Samples from teat canal and milk (foremilk and stripping) were taken from healthy and mastitic mammary quarters. A screening of the surface properties and antagonistic substances production of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from the mammary gland was performed to select potential probiotic strains to prevent mastitis. Somatic cell count, physico-chemical and microbiological studies were carried out. Pre-selected microorganisms were genetically identified. Compared with stripping milk, foremilk showed lower levels of fat and higher levels of pH, density, microorganism numbers, lower percentage of strains with mean and high hydrophobicity and mean autoaggregation and higher number of strains able to produce hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins. The other parameters analyzed were not statistically significant. One hundred and two LAB strains were isolated. Most of them had low degrees of hydrophobicity and autoaggregation. No correlation between these properties was found. Antagonistic metabolites were mainly produced by strains isolated from healthy quarters. Most of the pre-selected strains were identified as Streptococcus bovis and Weissella paramesenteroides. Three bacteriocin-producers were found and their products partially characterized. The results of this work are the basis for the further design of a specie-specific probiotic product able to prevent BM.
TI  - Properties and role of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in the control of fermentation pattern and growth in a ruminal bacterium, Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - To clarify the control of glycolysis and the fermentation pattern in Streptococcus bovis, the molecular and enzymatic properties of NAD(+)-specific glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were examined. The GAPDH gene (gapA) was found to cluster with several others, including those that encode phosphoglycerate kinase and translation elongation factor G, however, gapA was transcribed in a monocistronic fashion. Since biochemical properties, such as optimal pH and affinity for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP), were not very different between GAPDH- and NADP(+)-specific glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPN), the flux from GAP may be greatly influenced by the relative amounts of these two enzymes. Using S. bovis JB1 as a parent, JB1gapA and JB1ldh, which overproduce GAPDH and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), respectively, were constructed to examine the control of the glycolytic flux and lactate production. There were no significant differences in growth rates and formate-to-lactate ratios among JB1, JB1gapA, and JB1ldh grown on glucose. When grown on lactose, JB1ldh showed a much lower formate-to-lactate ratio than JB1gapA, which showed the highest NADH-to-NAD(+) ratio. However, growth rates did not differ among JB1, JB1gapA, and JB1ldh. These results suggest that GAPDH is not involved in the control of the glycolytic flux and that lactate production is mainly controlled by LDH activity.
TI  - Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor: a secreted pattern recognition receptor for mycobacteria.
AB  - RATIONALE: Human secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) displays bactericidal activity against pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Streptococcus. Furthermore, it has been reported that murine SLPI shows potent antimycobacterial activity. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to investigate whether human recombinant SLPI not only kills mycobacteria but also acts as a pattern recognition receptor for the host immune system. METHODS: For the in vivo experiment, BALB/c mice were infected by intranasal instillation with Mycobacterium bovis BCG and viable BCG load in lung homogenates was later determined. For the in vitro experiments, SLPI was incubated overnight with a suspension of M. bovis BCG or the virulent strain Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, and the percentage survival as well as the binding of SLPI to mycobacteria was determined. Furthermore, bacteria phagocytosis was also determined by flow cytometry. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Intranasal SLPI treatment decreased the number of colony-forming units recovered from lung homogenates, indicating that SLPI interfered with M. bovis BCG infection. Moreover, SLPI decreased the viability of both M. bovis BCG and H37Rv. We demonstrated that SLPI attached to the surface of the mycobacteria by binding to pathogen-associated molecular pattern mannan-capped lipoarabinomannans and phosphatidylinositol mannoside. Furthermore, we found that in the sputum of patients with tuberculosis, mycobacteria were coated with endogenous SLPI. Finally, we showed that phagocytosis of SLPI-coated mycobacteria was faster than that of uncoated bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: The present results demonstrate for the first time that human SLPI kills mycobacteria and is a new pattern recognition receptor for them.
TI  - Efficient production of optically pure D-lactic acid from raw corn starch by using a genetically modified L-lactate dehydrogenase gene-deficient and alpha-amylase-secreting Lactobacillus plantarum strain.
AB  - In order to achieve direct and efficient fermentation of optically pure D-lactic  acid from raw corn starch, we constructed L-lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhL1)-deficient Lactobacillus plantarum and introduced a plasmid encoding Streptococcus bovis 148 alpha-amylase (AmyA). The resulting strain produced only D-lactic acid from glucose and successfully expressed amyA. With the aid of secreting AmyA, direct D-lactic acid fermentation from raw corn starch was accomplished. After 48 h of fermentation, 73.2 g/liter of lactic acid was produced with a high yield (0.85 g per g of consumed sugar) and an optical purity of 99.6%. Moreover, a strain replacing the ldhL1 gene with an amyA-secreting expression cassette was constructed. Using this strain, direct D-lactic acid fermentation from raw corn starch was accomplished in the absence of selective pressure by antibiotics. This is the first report of direct D-lactic acid fermentation from raw starch.
TI  - Infectious agents and colorectal cancer: a review of Helicobacter pylori, Streptococcus bovis, JC virus, and human papillomavirus.
AB  - Based on the high volume of bacteria and viruses that the intestine is exposed to and the importance of infectious agents in some gastrointestinal and anogenital cancers, it is not surprising the many studies have evaluated the association between colorectal cancer and infectious agents. This review highlights investigations of four agents in relation to colorectal cancer. Helicobacter pylori, Streptococcus bovis, JC virus, and human papillomavirus have all been evaluated as possible etiologic agents for colorectal cancer. For each of these agents, a review of possible mechanisms for carcinogenesis and epidemiologic evidence is discussed, and future directions for research are proposed.
TI  - Direct production of cadaverine from soluble starch using Corynebacterium glutamicum coexpressing alpha-amylase and lysine decarboxylase.
AB  - Here, we demonstrated the one-step production of cadaverine from starch using a Corynebacterium glutamicum strain coexpressing Streptococcus bovis 148 alpha-amylase (AmyA) and Escherichia coli K-12 lysine decarboxylase (CadA). We constructed the E. coli-C. glutamicum shuttle vector, which produces CadA under the control of the high constitutive expression (HCE) promoter, and transformed this vector into C. glutamicum CSS secreting AmyA. The engineered C. glutamicum expressed both CadA and AmyA, which retained their activity. We performed cadaverine fermentation using 50 g/l soluble starch as the sole carbon source without pyridoxal-5'-phosphate, which is the coenzyme for CadA. C. glutamicum coexpressing AmyA and CadA successfully produced cadaverine from soluble starch and the yield of cadaverine was 23.4 mM after 21 h. CadA expression levels under the control of the HCE promoter were assumed to be sufficient to convert L-lysine to cadaverine, as there was no accumulation of L-lysine in the culture medium during fermentation. Thus, we demonstrated that C. glutamicum has great potential to produce cadaverine from biomass resources.
TI  - Identification of Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus as the etiological agent in a case of culture-negative multivalve infective endocarditis by 16S rDNA PCR analysis of resected valvular tissue.
AB  - Today, PCR using broad-range primers is being used increasingly to detect pathogens from resected heart valves. Herein is described the first case of multivalve infective endocarditis where 16S rDNA PCR was used to detect a single pathogen from two affected valves in a 61-year-old man. Triple heart valve replacement was required despite six weeks of appropriate antimicrobial therapy. The organism was confirmed as Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus, a member of the 'S. equinus/S. bovis' complex. To date, only one report has been made of human infection due to this organism. This may be due to the limited resolution of the routine diagnostic methods used and/or as a consequence of the complex nomenclature associated with this group of organisms.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis bacteraemia: identification within organism complex and association with endocarditis and colonic malignancy.
AB  - AIM: To identify Streptococcus bovis bacteraemia episodes and their clinical associations, including differences in associations by S. bovis biotypes (or species). METHODS: The study was performed at Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane. Streptococcus bovis blood culture results for 1999-2006 were retrieved. Patient data including diagnosis and investigations were retrospectively obtained from clinical records and compared with the microbiological result, including S. bovis biotype/species. RESULTS: Twenty evaluable S. bovis bacteraemia episodes were identified. Ten were S. bovis biotype I (Streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies gallolyticus) and 10 S. bovis II. For S. bovis I infections, six patients had a diagnosis of infective endocarditis. Nine had assessment for colonic pathology and all had malignant or premalignant colonic lesions. Of patients with S. bovis II infections, two were diagnosed with endocarditis and six had a hepatobiliary source of infection. Of five patients assessed in this group, three had premalignant colonic lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Endocarditis and hepatobiliary infections were the main causes of S. bovis bacteraemia. Endocarditis was diagnosed in the majority of S. bovis I bacteraemias and all patients assessed in this group had premalignant/malignant colonic lesions. Determining S. bovis biotype/species provides information on likely clinical associations of bacteraemia episodes.
TI  - Current features of infective endocarditis in elderly patients: results of the International Collaboration on Endocarditis Prospective Cohort Study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elderly patients are emerging as a population at high risk for infective endocarditis (IE). However, adequately sized prospective studies on the features of IE in elderly patients are lacking. METHODS: In this multinational, prospective, observational cohort study within the International Collaboration on Endocarditis, 2759 consecutive patients were enrolled from June 15, 2000, to December 1, 2005; 1056 patients with IE 65 years or older were compared with 1703 patients younger than 65 years. Risk factors, predisposing conditions, origin, clinical features, course, and outcome of IE were comprehensively analyzed. RESULTS: Elderly patients reported more frequently a hospitalization or an invasive procedure before IE onset. Diabetes mellitus and genitourinary and gastrointestinal cancer were the major predisposing conditions. Blood culture yield was higher among elderly patients with IE. The leading causative organism was Staphylococcus aureus, with a higher rate of methicillin resistance. Streptococcus bovis and enterococci were also significantly more prevalent. The clinical presentation of elderly patients with IE was remarkable for lower rates of embolism, immune-mediated phenomena, or septic complications. At both echocardiography and surgery, fewer vegetations and more abscesses were found, and the gain in the diagnostic yield of transesophageal echocardiography was significantly larger. Significantly fewer elderly patients underwent cardiac surgery (38.9% vs 53.5%; P < .001). Elderly patients with IE showed a higher rate of in-hospital death (24.9% vs 12.8%; P < .001), and age older than 65 years was an independent predictor of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective study, increasing age emerges as a major determinant of the clinical characteristics of IE. Lower rates of surgical treatment and high mortality are the most prominent features of elderly patients with IE. Efforts should be made to prevent health care-associated acquisition and improve outcomes in this major subgroup of patients with IE.
TI  - Effects of feeding polyclonal antibody preparations on rumen fermentation patterns, performance, and carcass characteristics of feedlot steers.
AB  - In a previous study, preparations of polyclonal antibodies (PAP) against Fusobacterium necrophorum (PAP-Fn) or Streptococcus bovis (PAP-Sb) were successful in decreasing ruminal counts of target bacteria and increasing ruminal pH in steers fed high-grain diets. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of feeding PAP-Fn or PAP-Sb on performance, carcass characteristics, and ruminal fermentation variables of feedlot steers. In Exp. 1, during 2 consecutive years, 226 or 192 Angus and Angus crossbred steers were fed a high-grain diet containing either PAP-Sb or PAP-Fn, or both. When measured on a BW basis, steers fed only PAP-Sb had a greater G:F (P < 0.05) than those fed no PAP. Nevertheless, when both PAP were fed, feed efficiency was similar (P > 0.10) to steers fed no PAP or only PAP-Sb. Steers receiving PAP-Fn (alone or in combination with PAP-Sb) had a decreased (P < 0.05) dressing percentage. Steers receiving PAP-Fn (alone or in combination with PAP-Sb) had a decreased severity of liver abscess (P < 0.05). No differences (P > 0.10) were observed in any other carcass characteristics. In Exp. 2, sixteen ruminally cannulated Angus crossbred steers (BW = 665 +/- 86 kg) were fed a high-grain diet containing either PAP-Sb or PAP-Fn, or both. Feeding only PAP-Fn or PAP-Sb for 19 d decreased (P < 0.05) ruminal counts of S. bovis when compared with steers fed both or no PAP. The ruminal counts of F. necrophorum in steers fed PAP-Fn alone or in combination with PAP-Sb were decreased by 98% (P < 0.05) after 19 d, when compared with the counts in control steers. Mean daily ruminal pH was greater (P < 0.05) in steers fed both PAP when compared with feeding either or no PAP. Ruminal pH in the first 4 h after feeding was greater (P < 0.05) for steers receiving PAP-Fn alone or in combination with PAP-Sb. Steers receiving either PAP alone or in combination had less (P < 0.05) ruminal NH(3)-N concentrations in the first 4 h after feeding when compared with those of control steers. Polyclonal antibody preparations against S. bovis were effective in enhancing G:F of steers fed high-grain diets, but dressing percentage was decreased. Mechanisms of enhancement of G:F remain unknown but may be related to changes in ruminal counts of target bacteria and associated effects on ruminal fermentation products.
TI  - [Recurrent infective endocarditis. A case report].
AB  - We report the case of a 63-year old patient presenting five infective endocarditis (IE) in a 13-years period, with different types of streptococcus. No entrance way had been found until the last relapse occurring on mitro-aortic bioprosthesis. This recurrence leads to the diagnosis of caecal adenocarcinoma by coloscopy, preceded and guided by PET scanner. It seems to be the initial entrance way which had been unrecognized because of its small size and its particular location, that is very difficult to observe by coloscopy. Recurrent streptococcus IE are rare and severe. When a gut or colic tumor is suspected, PET scan seems to be helpful in etiological survey.
TI  - CNS mastitis: nothing to worry about?
AB  - In this paper, we analyzed a very large field data set on intramammary infections (IMI) and the associated somatic cell count (SCC) in dairy cows. The objective of the study was to analyze the impact of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) IMI on cow SCC, both mean and variability, and on the potential of these infections to have a major impact on the bulk milk SCC (BMSCC). Data and milk samples for bacterial culture were collected by Quality Milk Production Services (QMPS) between 1992 and March of 2007. The QMPS program services dairy farms in New York State and other states in the Northeastern USA and operates in conjunction with Cornell University. Only records from cows where SCC and milk production data were available, and where only one organism was isolated from bacterial cultures of milk samples (or where culture was negative) were used for this analysis. A total of 352,614 records from 4200 whole herd mastitis screening sampling qualified for this study. Within herds an average of 15% (S.D. 12%) of cows sampled were infected with CNS, ranging between 0 and 100%. Average within herd prevalence of cows with a CNS IMI and an SCC over 200,000 cells/ml was 2% (S.D. 4%) with a minimum of 0% and a maximum of 50%. Results of linear mixed models showed three distinct populations of IMI statuses: negative cultures with the lowest SCC; CNS and Corynebacterium bovis with a moderate increase in SCC, and Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus showing an important increase in SCC. Surprisingly, milk production was slightly but significantly higher in CNS infected cows compared to culture-negative cows, whereas it was strongly reduced in cows with a major pathogen IMI. The percentage contribution of CNS infections to the BMSCC was 17.9% in herds with a BMSCC less than 200,000 cells/ml. This value decreased to 11.9 and 7.9% in herds with bulk milk SCC between 200,000 and 400,000 and over 400,000 cells/ml, respectively. We concluded that very few herds with milk quality problems would have an important increase in BMSCC that could be mostly attributed to CNS infections. On the other hand, in herds with low BMSCC, CNS infections may be an important contributor to the total number of somatic cells in the bulk milk.
TI  - Biotransformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by pure culture ruminal bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-one ruminal bacteria species were tested for their ability to degrade 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) within 24 h. Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Lactobacillus vitulinus, Selenomonas ruminantium, Streptococcus caprinus, and Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were able to completely degrade 100 mg/L TNT, with <5% of the original TNT recovered as diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. Eubacterium ruminantium, Lactobacillus ruminis, Ruminobacter amylophilus, Streptococcus bovis, and Wolinella succinogenes were able to completely degrade 100 mg/L TNT, with 23-60% of the TNT recovered as aminodinitrotoluene and/or diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. Clostridium polysaccharolyticum, Megasphaera elsdenii, Prevotella bryantii, Prevotella ruminicola, Ruminococcus albus, and Ruminococcus flavefaciens were able to degrade 80-90% of 100 mg/L TNT. Desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans, Prevotella albensis, and Treponema bryantii degraded 50-80% of the TNT. Anaerovibrio lipolytica was completely inhibited by 100 mg/L TNT. These results indicate that a variety of rumen bacteria is capable of transforming TNT.
TI  - A traditional Sudanese fermented camel's milk product, Gariss, as a habitat of Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius.
AB  - Samples of the traditional Sudanese fermented camel's milk product Gariss representing 9 different regions in Sudan were microbiologically characterized using an integrated approach including phenotypic and genotypic methods. Lactic acid bacteria [log(CFU/g)=7.76-8.66] and yeasts [log(CFU/g)=6.05-7.79] were detected in high numbers. A total of 180 LAB isolates were identified of which 123 isolates were found to belong to the Streptococcus bovis group. Thirteen representative isolates were characterized by PCR amplification and sequencing of the housekeeping genes rpoB and sodA and the streptococcal glucosyltransferase gene (gtf). All thirteen isolates were identified as Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius, a potential human pathogen. The gene encoding the virulence determinant gtf was detected in 10 of the 13 tested strains. The same isolates were able to survive exposure to 0.3% (w/v) oxgall for 4 h and pH=2.7 for 1-4 h. Also Lactobacillus fermentum were detected in high numbers, whereas Enterococcus faecium and Lactobacillus helveticus were detected more occasionally. The yeast microflora in all Gariss samples consisted of Kluyveromyces marxianus and Issatchenkia orientalis with the former being predominant in 7 out of 9 samples.
TI  - Comprehensive study of strains previously designated Streptococcus bovis consecutively isolated from human blood cultures and emended description of Streptococcus gallolyticus and Streptococcus infantarius subsp. coli.
AB  - Modern taxonomy has delineated Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, Streptococcus infantarius subsp. coli, and S. infantarius subsp. infantarius within the heterogenous group of previously designated clinical Streptococcus bovis bacteria. In the present study, 58 consecutive blood culture isolates initially designated S. bovis were further characterized by applying phenotypic and molecular genetic methods, and possible disease associations were investigated by studying the patients' records. Published phenotypic characteristics of S. gallolyticus and S. infantarius were not unequivocal and did not allow an unambiguous phenotypic differentiation of the 58 clinical isolates. However, full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences clearly assigned the strains to S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (n = 29), S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (n = 12), and S. infantarius subsp. coli (n = 17). Only 28% of the patients with available records presented with endocarditis and 7% presented with colon carcinoma, whereas 37% of the patients had altered liver parenchyma and 28% had gall bladder disease as underlying diseases. Detailed antimicrobial susceptibility data on both S. gallolyticus subspecies and S. infantarius subsp. coli are given for the first time. As a result of the extensive characterization of the largest number of S. gallolyticus and S. infantarius human clinical isolates published so far, emended species descriptions are given. It is recommended that both clinical microbiologists and infectious disease specialists avoid the designation S. bovis for true S. gallolyticus and S. infantarius strains in the future in order to get a clearer picture of the possible disease associations of these species.
TI  - Use of primers based on the heat shock protein genes hsp70, hsp40, and hsp10, for the detection of bovine mastitis pathogens Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis and Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, and Streptococcus bovis are three of the major pathogens which cause mastitis in dairy herds. Since conventional methods for the detection of these mastitis pathogens are laborious and time-consuming, rapid methods are needed. With an attempt to know if heat shock protein (HSP) genes other than HSP60 gene, could be used for PCR primer designing, in this study, we tried to design PCR primers based on the heat shock protein genes hsp70, hsp40, and hsp10 for the specific detection of S. agalactiae, S. uberis, and S. bovis, respectively. Using these primers, all the randomly selected target strains could be specifically detected. Bacterial species other than the target organisms, including strains of other Streptococcus spp., and strains of non-Streptococcus spp., would not generate any false positive results. As these PCR primers were used for direct detection of mastitis pathogens, the detection limit was N (N=1-9) x 10(3)CFU/ml of cell dilutions. If a 10h pre-enrichment step was performed, the detection limit was N x 10(0)CFU/ml. Thus, these primers could be used for the specific and sensitive detection of bovine mastitis bacteria.
TI  - Development of a novel biochip for rapid multiplex detection of seven mastitis-causing pathogens in bovine milk samples.
AB  - To efficiently prevent and treat bovine mastitis and minimize its effect on the dairy industry, a sensitive, rapid, and specific test is required for identifying the mastitis-causing pathogens. In this study, a biochip capable of detecting 7 common species of mastitis-causing pathogens, including Corynebacterium bovis, Mycoplasma bovis, Staphylococcus aureus, and the Streptococcus spp. S. agalactiae, S. bovis, S. dysgalactiae, and S. uberis, within 6 hr was developed. The technique is based on DNA amplification of genes specific to the target pathogens and consists of 4 basic steps: DNA extraction of bacteria, polymerase chain reaction, DNA hybridization, and colorimetric reaction. To examine the accuracy and specificity of this biochip, a preliminary test with 82 random quarter milk samples were analyzed and compared with results from conventional microbiological methods conducted simultaneously. Results from all but 1 sample analyzed by the biochip were in agreement with those analyzed by bacteriology. The biochip could be a feasible tool for rapidly diagnosing mastitis-causing pathogens in milk and providing information for a more effective treatment to cure mastitis.
TI  - Molecular properties and transcriptional control of the phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase genes in a ruminal bacterium, Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - Molecular properties of pyruvate kinase (PYK) and phosphofructokinase (PFK) in Streptococcus bovis and transcriptional control of the two enzymes were examined. Sequence analysis indicated that the PYK gene (pyk) clusters with the PFK gene (pfk) and several other genes. It was demonstrated that the pyk and pfk are cotranscribed and their transcription appeared to be regulated at the transcriptional level in response to the sugars supplied. The intracellular pyk-mRNA level was lower in a catabolite control protein A (CcpA)-disrupted mutant than in its parent strain, and a binding site of CcpA was found in the upstream region of pfk. These results suggest that pfk-pyk transcription is enhanced by CcpA. A recombinant pyk-overexpressing strain showed approximately five-fold higher PYK activity, but it did not affect the growth rate or formate-to-lactate ratio significantly, suggesting that the flux in the glycolytic pathway is not altered by an increase in PYK activity.
TI  - New strategy for enhancement of microbial viability in simulated gastric conditions based on display of starch-binding domain on cell surface.
AB  - The C-terminal region of the peptidoglycan hydrolase (CPH) of Lactococcus lactis  IL1403 fused to the linker region and the starch-binding domain (SBD) of the *-amylase of Streptococcus bovis 148 was produced intracellularly in Escherichia coli. The fusion protein (CPH-SBD) was able to bind to the cell surface of Lactobacillus casei NRRL B-441 and to corn starch. Therefore, adhesion of cells to corn starch was mediated by the fusion protein. At a cell density of 10(9) cfu/ml and a starch concentration of 5 mg/ml, CPH-SBD-displaying L. casei cells aggregated with corn starch, whereas the free cells of L. casei did not form any aggregates with corn starch. After incubation in simulated gastric juice (pH 3.0, 1 h), the survival percentages of free cells, amylose-coated free cells, and free cells mixed with corn starch were 0.074%, 7.2%, and 3.1% respectively. When CPH-SBD-displaying bacteria aggregated with corn starch, their survival percentage was 8% higher than that of free cells mixed with corn starch. The survival of the amylose-coated CPH-SBD-displaying L. casei cells was comparable to that of amylose-coated free cells, whereas the survival percentage of amylose-coated aggregates of CPH-SBD-displaying bacteria with corn starch was 28% higher than that of amylose-coated mixture of free cells with corn starch. These results demonstrate the potential usefulness of the cell-surface display technique for enhancement of the delivery of viable microorganisms to the intestinal tract.
TI  - Colonoscopy is mandatory after Streptococcus bovis endocarditis: a lesson still not learned. Case report.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Even though the relationship between certain bacterial infections and neoplastic lesions of the colon is well-recognized, this knowledge has not been sufficiently translated into routine practice yet. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 51-year-old man who was admitted to our Surgical Department due to rectal bleeding and abdominal pain. Preoperative colonoscopy, staging exams and subsequent surgery demonstrated a stenotic adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon, invading the left urinary tract and the homolateral bladder wall, with regional lymph nodes involvement and massive bilobar liver metastases (T4N1M1). After Hartmann's rectosigmoidectomy and despite systemic chemotherapy, a rapid progression occurred and the patient survived for only 5 months after diagnosis. Five years before detecting this advanced colonic cancer, the patient underwent aortic valve replacement due to a severe Streptococcus bovis endocarditis. Subsequent to this infection he never underwent a colonoscopy until overt intestinal symptoms appeared. CONCLUSION: As this case illustrates, in the unusual setting of a Streptococcus bovis infection, it is necessary to timely and carefully rule out occult colon cancer and other malignancies during hospitalization and, if a tumor is not found, to schedule endoscopic follow-up. Rigorous application of these recommendations in the case described would have likely led to an earlier diagnosis of cancer and maybe saved the patient's life.
TI  - The activity and stability of cell-associated activity of bovicin HC5, a bacteriocin from Streptococcus bovis HC5.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis HC5 cultures released a broad spectrum lantibiotic, bovicin HC5, into the cell-fee culture supernatant after they reached stationary phase, but most of the antibacterial activity remained cell-associated. Cell-associated bovicin HC5 was more resistant to degradation by Pronase E than the cell-free activity. Acidic NaCl (pH 2.0, 100 mM) did not release all of the cell-associated activity, and cells that were sequentially treated with acidic NaCl and Pronase E still had antibacterial activity. Cell-associated activity retained after acidic NaCl treatment was still able to catalyze potassium efflux from S. bovis JB1, a sensitive strain. These results indicate that cell-associated bovicin HC5 is more active and stable than cell-free bovicin HC5.
TI  - Infective endocarditis from Streptococcus viridans associated with colonic carcinoma: a case report.
AB  - Streptococcal bacteremia is an uncommon presentation for colorectal malignancy, yet most physicians would probably be aware of the association between Streptococcus bovis infection and such malignancy; however, many physicians may be unaware that other streptococcal species are also associated with colon and rectal cancers. We describe a 62-year-old male with adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon with the presentation of infective endocarditis due to infection by Streptococcus viridans, and we also report on the condition's successful treatment.
TI  - Bioethanol production from uncooked raw starch by immobilized surface-engineered  yeast cells.
AB  - Surface-engineered yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae codisplaying Rhizopus oryzae glucoamylase and Streptococcus bovis alpha-amylase on the cell surface was used for direct production of ethanol from uncooked raw starch. By using 50 g/L cells during batch fermentation, ethanol concentration could reach 53 g/L in 7 days. During repeated batch fermentation, the production of ethanol could be maintained for seven consecutive cycles. For cells immobilized in loofa sponge, the concentration of ethanol could reach 42 g/L in 3 days in a circulating packed-bed bioreactor. However, the production of ethanol stopped thereafter because of limited contact between cells and starch. The bioreactor could be operated for repeated batch production of ethanol, but ethanol concentration dropped to 55% of its initial value after five cycles because of a decrease in cell mass and cell viability in the bioreactor. Adding cells to the bioreactor could partially restore ethanol production to 75% of its initial value.

TI  - Semi-quantitative analysis of Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Fibrobacter succinogenes and Streptococcus bovis in the equine large intestine using real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - There is a need to further our understanding of the role that the equine hindgut  ecosystem plays in digestive processes and diseases. The aim of the present study was to utilise the real-time PCR technique to determine the abundance of candidate cellulolytic (Ruminococcus flavefaciens; Fibrobacter succinogenes) and non-cellulolytic (Streptococcus bovis) bacteria in lumen contents from the caecum, ventral and dorsal colon, and rectum of healthy horses (n 14). Total DNA was extracted from frozen and lyophilised lumen contents, and PCR primers and Taqman probes were designed based on 16S rDNA sequences for specific detection of candidate bacterial species. Overall, in frozen and lyophilised digesta, there were significantly (P F. succinogenes > S. bovis (P < 0.05), while in lyophilised digesta R. flavefaciens was present in significantly (P < 0.05) greater amounts than F. succinogenes and S. bovis. R. flavefaciens and F. succinogenes were abundant at significantly (P < 0.05) greater levels in lyophilised digesta v. frozen digesta, with no difference in S. bovis levels. These data indicate that for these bacteria at least, faeces are a suitable model for studying the bacterial ecosystem within the equine colon. The present study also indicates that the preservation method of digesta affects levels of bacteria detected.
TI  - PCR-RFLP assay for species and subspecies differentiation of the Streptococcus bovis group based on groESL sequences.
AB  - The sequence diversity of groESL genes among Streptococcus bovis group isolates was analysed, including five reference strains and 36 clinical isolates. Phylogenetic analysis of the groES and groEL sequences showed that the isolates that belonged to the same species or subspecies usually clustered together. The intergenic spacer region between groES and groEL was variable in size (67-342 bp) and sequence and appeared to be a unique marker for species or subspecies determination. Sequence similarities of the groESL genes among species and subspecies ranged from 84.2 to 99.0 % in groES, and from 88.0 to 99.0 % in groEL. Based on the sequences determined, a Streptococcus bovis group-specific PCR assay was developed, which may provide an alternative means of distinguishing the bovis group from other viridans streptococci. Restriction digestion of the amplicon with AclI further differentiated the species and subspecies.
TI  - Bovicin HC5, a lantibiotic produced by Streptococcus bovis HC5, catalyzes the efflux of intracellular potassium but not ATP.
AB  - Bovicin HC5, a broad-spectrum lantibiotic produced by Streptococcus bovis HC5, catalyzed the efflux of intracellular potassium from Streptococcus bovis JB1, a sensitive strain. The level of ATP also decreased, but this decline appeared to be caused by the activity of the F(1)F(0) ATPase rather than efflux per se.
TI  - Bidirectional cell-surface anchoring function of C-terminal repeat region of peptidoglycan hydrolase of Lactococcus lactis IL1403.
AB  - With the aim of constructing an efficient protein display system for lactic acid  bacteria (LABs), the effect of fusion direction on the cell-surface binding activity of the C-terminal region of the peptidoglycan hydrolase (CPH) of Lactococcus lactis IL1403 was studied. CPH fused to the alpha-amylase (AMY) of Streptococcus bovis 148 either at its C-terminus (CPH-AMY) or at its N-terminus (AMY-CPH) was expressed intracellularly in Escherichia coli. This domain was able to direct binding of AMY to the surface of L. lactis ATCC 19435 in both constructs. However, the number of bound molecules per cell and the specific activity for starch digestion in the case of CPH-AMY were 3 and 14 times greater than those in the case of AMY-CPH, respectively. Of the LABs tested, L. lactis ATCC 19435 showed the highest binding capability for CPH-AMY, up to 6 x 10(4) molecules per cell, with a dissociation rate constant of 5.00 x 10(-5) s(-1). The binding of CPH-AMY to the surface of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ATCC 9649 cells was very stable with a dissociation rate constant of 6.96 x 10(-6) s(-1). The production of CPH-AMY in the soluble form increased 3-fold as a result of coexpression with a molecular chaperone, trigger factor. The results of this study suggest the usefulness of CPH as a bidirectional anchor protein for the production of cell-surface adhesive enzymes in E. coli. Furthermore, the importance of the fusion direction of CPH in determining cell-surface binding and enzymatic activities was shown.
TI  - Surveillance of patients at increased risk of colon cancer: inflammatory bowel disease and other conditions.
AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. Colonoscopic screening with removal of adenomatous polyps in individuals at average risk is known to decrease the incidence and associated mortality from colon cancer. Certain conditions, notably inflammatory bowel disease involving the colon, a family history of polyps or cancer, a personal history of colon cancer or polyps, and other conditions such as acromegaly, ureterosigmoidostomy, and Streptococcus bovis bacteremia are associated with an increased risk of colonic neoplasia. This article reviews the CRC risks associated with these conditions and the currently recommended surveillance strategies.
TI  - Steptococcus bovis meningitis and sepsis associated with Strongyloidiasis in an immunocompetent patient.
AB  - We report the case of a 69-year-old female who presented with headache, stiff neck, and decreased level of consciousness. Lumbar puncture results were typical of bacterial meningitis. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures showed Streptococcus bovis. Subsequent serologic studies indicated concurrent Strongyloides stercoralis infection, and larvae were visualized in two separate stool specimens. The patient responded to treatment of both infections. She refused to undergo colonoscopy despite a known association between Streptococcus bovis and colonic carcinoma.
TI  - [A case of bacterial meningitis due to Streptococcus bovis in an infant with normal cerebrospinal fluid findings at the first CSF examination].
AB  - Streptococcus bovis very occasionally causes rarely sepsis, endocarditis, and meningitis in newborns and the elderly. We report the case of infant meningitis caused by S. bovis despite normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings at the first CSF examination. A 77-day-old boy with 21-trisomy and patent foramen ovale and seen for a high fever underwent blood examination and lumbar puncture due to toxic appearance despite a lack of meningeal signs, and was admitted. His CSF findings were normal and he was given intravenous ceftriaxone against potential bacteremia. He had systemic seizures with continuous fever for 2 days after admission and a second CSF examination. Gram-positive coccus grew from his CSF at the first examination, and CSF cells from the second lumbar puncture increased to 4060/tL (86% neutrophils), so vancomycin was added against potential enterococcal meningitis. S. bovis was finally grown from the first CSF, ceftriaxone discontinued, and intravenous ampicillin added. He recovered after 20 days of antibiotic administration. S. bovis becomes a potential pathogen for meningitis in infants, and must be considered as a cause of meningitis despite its very rarity. CSF findings at the first lumbar puncture may be normal for meningitis in newborns and infants at the first CSF examination, so we must be very careful in the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis even with normal CSF findings, and considered antibiotic treatment against potential bacterial meningitis.

TI  - The characterization of lactic acid producing bacteria from the rumen of dairy cattle grazing on improved pasture supplemented with wheat and barley grain.
AB  - AIMS: To identify and characterize the major lactic acid bacteria in the rumen of dairy cattle grazing improved pasture of rye grass and white clover and receiving a maize silage and grain supplement with and without virginiamycin. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-five bacterial isolates were obtained from the rumen of 16 Holstein-Friesian dairy cows. The isolates were initially grouped on the basis of their Gram morphology and by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the PCR amplified 16S rDNA. A more definitive analysis was undertaken by comparing the 16S rDNA sequences. Many of the isolates were closely related to other previously characterized rumen bacteria, including Streptococcus bovis, Lactobacillus vitulinus, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Prevotella bryantii and Selenomonas ruminantium. The in vitro production of L- and/or D-lactate was seen with all but five of the isolates examined, many of which were also resistant to virginiamycin. CONCLUSION: Supplementation of grain with virginiamycin may reduce the risk of acidosis but does not prevent its occurrence in dairy cattle grazing improved pasture. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study shows that lactic acid production is caused, not only by various thoroughly researched types of bacteria, but also by others previously identified in the rumen but not further characterized.
TI  - Bovicin HC5 reduces thermal resistance of Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris in acidic mango pulp.
AB  - AIMS: To test the effect of bovicin HC5 against vegetative cells and endospores of Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris DSMZ 2498 in synthetic media and in acidic mango pulp. METHODS AND RESULTS: Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris was grown in synthetic medium at 40 degrees C and pH 4.0. The effect on vegetative cells was assayed by adding bovicin HC5 to synthetic medium (40-160 AU ml(-1)) or to mango pulp (100 AU ml(-1)) at various pH values and determining the effect on growth (OD(600 nm)) and viable cell number, respectively. The effect of bovicin HC5 on spore germination and thermal sensitivity of A. acidoterrestris was tested in mango pulp (pH 4.0) containing 80 AU ml(-1) of bovicin HC5. Bovicin HC5 was bactericidal against vegetative cells of A. acidoterrestris at different pH values and showed sporicidal activity against endospores of this bacterium. When spores of A. acidoterrestris were heat treated in the presence of bovicin HC5, D-values decreased 77% to 95% compared to untreated controls at temperatures ranging from 80 to 95 degrees C. CONCLUSION: Bovicin HC5 was bactericidal and sporicidal against A. acidoterrestrsi DSMZ 2498. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These results indicated that bovicin HC5 has potential to prevent spoilage of acidic fruit juices by thermocidophilic spore-forming bacteria.
TI  - Characteristics of Streptococcus bovis endocarditis and its differences with Streptococcus viridans endocarditis.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the characteristics of infective endocarditis (IE) caused by S. bovis and compare them to those caused by streptococci of the viridans group (SVG). A prospective study was undertaken considering 55 consecutive cases of IE due to S. bovis and 41 to SVG over 18 years. The study was divided into two periods (1988-1996 and 1997-2005). S. bovis caused 24% of the IE in our centre and constituted the main aetiology for this disease, showing an increase of 358% during the second period studied. Biotype I was responsible for 94.5% of cases and there was a high degree of association with colon tumours (53%). Over the period of the study, 107 patients admitted to our hospital had bacteraemia caused by S. bovis and 310 patients had bacteraemia caused by SVG. In the first group, 55 (51%) were endocarditis cases, but only 41 (13%) of the patients with SVG bacteraemia had endocarditis (p < 0.0001). The distinguishing features of endocarditis caused by S. bovis in comparison with those caused by SGV were: a greater increase in cases during the 2nd period studied (from 12 to 43 vs. from 19 to 22, p < 0.01), a higher percentage of males (93% vs. 71%, p < 0.004), patients significantly older (median age 66 vs. 58.5, p < 0.004), less predisposing cardiopathy (42% vs. 76%, p < 0.0009), more bivalvular involvement (42% vs. 22%, p < 0.04), more spondylitis (9% vs. 0%, p < 0.04), a higher association with colonic tumours (53% vs. 5%, p < 0.0001), and a higher percentage of antibiotic resistance: erythromycin 66% vs. 19%, p < 0.0001; clindamycin 67% vs. 11%, p < 0.0001; cotrimoxazole 77% vs. 30.5%, p < 0.0001, respectively. IE due to S. bovis is an emergent disease in our environment, presenting different characteristics to those produced by SVG.
TI  - Streptococcus henryi sp. nov. and Streptococcus caballi sp. nov., isolated from the hindgut of horses with oligofructose-induced laminitis.
AB  - Four Gram-positive, catalase-negative, coccoid-shaped isolates were obtained from the caecum and rectum of horses with oligofructose-induced equine laminitis. Phenotypic and phylogenetic studies were performed on these isolates. Initial biochemical profiling assigned two of the isolates to Streptococcus bovis. The other two isolates, however, could not be assigned conclusively on the basis of their biochemical profiles. Gene sequence analysis demonstrated that the four new isolates were related most closely to Streptococcus suis based on the 16S rRNA gene and to Streptococcus orisratti based on the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase gene (sodA). Sequence divergence values from recognized Streptococcus species based on these two genes were >3 and >13%, respectively, for all four isolates. Phylogenetic and phenotypic analyses demonstrated that the four isolates formed two distinct clonal groups that are suggested to represent two novel species of the genus Streptococcus. The names proposed for these organisms are Streptococcus henryi sp. nov. (type strain 126(T) =ATCC BAA-1484(T) =DSM 19005(T)) and Streptococcus caballi sp. nov. (type strain 151(T) =ATCC BAA-1485(T) =DSM 19004(T)).

TI  - System using tandem repeats of the cA peptidoglycan-binding domain from Lactococcus lactis for display of both N- and C-terminal fusions on cell surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Here, we established a system for displaying heterologous protein to the C terminus of the peptidoglycan-binding domain (cA domain) of AcmA (a major autolysin from Lactococcus lactis). Western blot and flow cytometric analyses revealed that the fusion proteins (cA-AmyA) of the cA domain and alpha-amylase from Streptococcus bovis 148 (AmyA) are efficiently expressed and successfully displayed on the surfaces of L. lactis cells. AmyA was also displayed on the cell surface while retaining its activity. Moreover, with an increase in the number of cA domains, the quantity of cA-AmyA fusion proteins displayed on the cell surface increased. When three repeats of the cA domain were used as an anchor protein, 82% of alpha-amylase activity was detected on the cells. The raw starch-degrading activity of AmyA was significantly higher when AmyA was fused to the C terminus of the cA domain than when it was fused to the N terminus. In addition, cA-AmyA fusion proteins were successfully displayed on the cell surfaces of Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus casei.

TI  - Effect of a blend of essential oil compounds on the colonization of starch-rich substrates by bacteria in the rumen.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the mode of action of a blend of essential oil compounds on  the colonization of starch-rich substrates by rumen bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Starch-rich substrates were incubated, in nylon bags, in the rumen of sheep organized in a 4 x 4 latin square design and receiving a 60:40 silage : concentrate diet. The concentrate was either high or low in crude protein, and the diet was supplemented or not with a commercial blend of essential oil compounds (110 mg per day). The total genomic DNA was extracted from the residues in the bags. The total eubacterial DNA was quantified by real-time PCR and the proportion of Ruminobacter amylophilus, Streptococcus bovis and Prevotella bryantii was determined. Neither the supplementation with essential oil compounds nor the amount of crude protein affected the colonization of the substrates by the bacteria quantified. However, colonization was significantly affected by the substrate colonized. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of essential oils on the colonization of starch-rich substrates is not mediated through the selective inhibition of R. amylophilus. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study enhances our understanding of the colonization of starch-rich substrates, as well as of the mode of action of the essential oils as rumen manipulating agents.
TI  - Biological and genetic classification of canine intestinal lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  - To investigate the distribution of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) inhabiting canine intestines, a total of 374 gram-positive LAB and bifidobacteria (BF) isolated from large intestinal contents in 36 dogs were classified and identified by phenotypic and genetic analyses. Based on cell morphological sizes, these isolates were divided into seven biotypes containing the genera Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus. The LAB and BF isolates were classified into 38 chemotypes based on SDS-PAGE protein profile analysis of whole cells. Furthermore, partial 16S rDNA sequencing analysis demonstrated the presence of 24 bacterial species in the 38 chemotypes from 36 dogs. The identified species consisted of ten species belonging to the genus Lactobacillus (78.8%), seven species to the genus Bifidobacterium (6.8%), five species to the genus Enterococcus (11.6%), one species of Streptococcus bovis (2.0%), and one species of Pediococcus acidilactici (0.8%). In particular, the most predominant species in canine intestines were L. reuteri, L. animalis, and L. johnsonii and were found in the high frequency of occurrence of 77.8, 80.6, and 86.1%, respectively. Besides these, Enterococcus faecalis, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, Pediococcus acidilactici, and Streptococcus bovis were also isolated in the present study. The sequences of the isolates also showed high levels of similarity to those of the reference strains registered previously in the DDBJ and the similarity was above 97.2%. Their partial 16S rRNA genes were registered in the DDBJ.

TI  - Direct production of L-lysine from raw corn starch by Corynebacterium glutamicum  secreting Streptococcus bovis alpha-amylase using cspB promoter and signal sequence.
AB  - Corynebacterium glutamicum is an important microorganism in the industrial production of amino acids. We engineered a strain of C. glutamicum that secretes alpha-amylase from Streptococcus bovis 148 (AmyA) for the efficient utilization of raw starch. Among the promoters and signal sequences tested, those of cspB from C. glutamicum possessed the highest expression level. The fusion gene was introduced into the homoserine dehydrogenase gene locus on the chromosome by homologous recombination. L-Lysine fermentation was conducted using C. glutamicum secreting AmyA in the growth medium containing 50 g/l of raw corn starch as the sole carbon source at various temperatures in the range 30 to 40 degrees C. Efficient L-lysine production and raw starch degradation were achieved at 34 and 37 degrees C, respectively. The alpha-amylase activity using raw corn starch was more than 2.5 times higher than that using glucose as the sole carbon source during L-lysine fermentation. AmyA expression under the control of cspB promoter was assumed to be induced when raw starch was used as the sole carbon source. These results indicate that efficient simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of raw corn starch to L-lysine were achieved by C. glutamicum secreting AmyA using the cspB promoter and signal sequence.
TI  - Molecular profiling of Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, and Bifidobacterium species  in feces of active racehorses.
AB  - Diversity and compositions of the Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, and Bifidobacterium group in the feces of six healthy, actively racing horses (Thoroughbreds) were analyzed by using PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and real-time PCR with primer sets specific for each group. PCR-DGGE analysis of the feces showed that Lactobacillus equi, Lactobacillus johnsonii, a phylogenetic relative of Lactobacillus salivarius, a phylogenetic relative of Lactobacillus gastricus, and Weissella confusa were predominant in almost all of the feces tested, and Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus was predominant in the Streptococcus group. The Bifidobacterium group was not detected by single-PCR but atypical species of the group were found in three of the six Thoroughbreds tested by nested-PCR. Calculation and estimation of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria revealed that lactic acid bacteria were predominant in the feces and bifidobacteria were minor. These results indicate that the community of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria in horse feces are unique because of the presence of specific species for horse feces and a minority of the Bifidobacterium group. Repeated tests of the feces from the same horse over 3 months showed that the diversity and composition of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria in the feces was basically stable throughout the test period.
TI  - Infective endocarditis associated with spondylodiscitis and frequent secondary epidural abscess.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although many patients with IE complain of joint, muscle, and back pain, infections at these sights are rare. Indeed, in patients with back pain and endocarditis, less than 4% actually demonstrate spondylodiscitis. CASE DESCRIPTION: We recently encountered 4 patients with this complication, one each caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus mitis, and Enterococcus faecalis, and wondered whether the nature of the infecting organism determined the development of spondylodiscitis and epidural abscess. In a literature review, 36 patients with endocarditis and spondylodiscitis were identified. Only 9 (25%) were caused by Streptococcus viridans and the remainder by staphylococci, enterococci, and other streptococci. Usually more than 50% of all cases of IE were caused by Streptococcus viridans, although more recent studies would indicate an incidence of about 40%. CONCLUSION: We conclude that spondylodiscitis with epidural abscess is more likely to occur in those patients with endocarditis who are infected by organisms with pyogenic potential.
TI  - The energy spilling reactions of bacteria and other organisms.
AB  - For many years it was assumed that living organisms always utilized ATP in a highly efficient manner, but simple growth studies with bacteria indicated that the efficiency of biomass production was often at least 3-fold lower than the amount that would be predicted from standard biosynthetic pathways. The utilization of energy for maintenance could only explain a small portion of this discrepancy particularly when the growth rate was high. These ideas and thermodynamic arguments indicated that cells might have another avenue of energy utilization. This phenomenon has also been called 'uncoupling', 'spillage' and 'overflow metabolism', but 'energy spilling' is probably the most descriptive term. It appears that many bacteria spill energy, and the few that do not can be killed (large and often rapid decrease in viability), if the growth medium is nitrogen-limited and the energy source is in 'excess'. The lactic acid bacterium, Streptococcus bovis, is an ideal bacterium for the study of energy spilling. Because it only uses substrate level phosphorylation to generate ATP, ATP generation can be calculated with a high degree of certainty. It does not store glucose as glycogen, and its cell membrane can be easily accessed. Comparative analysis of heat production, membrane voltage, ATP production and Ohm's law indicated that the energy spilling reaction of S. bovis is mediated by a futile cycle of protons through the cell membrane. Less is known about Escherichia coli, but in this bacterium energy spilling could be mediated by a futile cycle of potassium or ammonium ions. Energy spilling is not restricted to prokaryotes and appears to occur in yeasts and in higher organisms. In man, energy spilling may be related to cancer, ageing, ischemia and cardiac failure.
TI  - Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of hindgut bacteria associated with the development of equine laminitis.
AB  - Carbohydrate-induced laminitis in horses is characterized by marked changes in the composition of the hindgut microbiota, from a predominantly Gram-negative population to one dominated by Gram-positive bacteria. The objective of this study was to monitor changes in the relative abundance of selected hindgut bacteria that have previously been implicated in the pathophysiology of equine laminitis using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Caecal cannulae were surgically implanted in five Standardbred horses and laminitis induced by oral administration of a bolus dose of oligofructose. Caecal fluid and faecal specimens were collected over a 48 h period at 2 to 4 h intervals post-oligofructose administration and subjected to FISH using probes specific for nine bacterial groups to determine changes in their relative abundance compared with total bacteria hybridizing to the generic EUBMIX probe. Additionally, hoof biopsies were taken over the course of the experiment at 6 h intervals and evaluated for histopathological changes consistent with laminitis, allowing changes in hindgut microbiota to be correlated with the onset of lesions in the foot. Of the microorganisms specifically targeted, streptococci of the Streptococcus bovis/equinus complex were the only bacteria that consistently proliferated in both caecal fluid and faeces immediately before the onset of histological signs of laminitis. Furthermore, lactobacilli, Enterobacteriaceae, Allisonella histaminiformans, enterococci, Bacteroides fragilis, Mitsuokella jalaludinii and Clostridium difficile did not establish significant populations in the hindgut before the onset of equine laminitis.
TI  - A case of endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis caused by Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus bovis is a gram-positive streptococcus present as normal flora in the digestive tracts of herbivores. It is occasionally isolated from the human intestine and may act as a causative organism of infectious endocarditis, urinary infections and meningitis. This report describes a rare case of a patient that underwent surgical treatment for endogenous endophthalmitis caused by S. bovis complicated by bacteremia and suppurative spondylitis. METHODS: Endophthalmitis of the right eye occurred in a 76-year-old man accompanied by hypopyon and prominent vitreous opacity complicated by suppurative spondylitis. The visual acuity of the right eye consisted of light perception. Lensectomy and vitrectomy were performed immediately using a perfusate containing antibiotics. Antibiotics were administered by intravenous infusion following surgery. RESULTS: S. bovis was detected in the cultures of blood and vitreous fluid collected during surgery. The visual acuity was 20/160 at 11 months after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Reports of endogenous endophthalmitis in human caused by S. bovis have not been found to date in a search of the MEDLINE database. This is the first report of acute endogenous endophthalmitis caused by S. bovis.
TI  - Bactericidal effect of bovicin HC5 and nisin against Clostridium tyrobutyricum isolated from spoiled mango pulp.
AB  - AIMS: To test the effect of bovicin HC5--a bacteriocin from Streptococcus bovis HC5--against the strains of Clostridium tyrobutyricum isolated from canned spoiled mango pulp. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bovicin HC5 [40-160 arbitrary unit (AU) ml(-1)] reduced the specific growth rate and increased the lag phase duration of the bacterial isolates inoculated in brain heart infusion media at 30 degrees C. The inhibitory activity of bovicin HC5 (100 AU ml(-1)) in mango pulp was bactericidal and more pronounced at acidic conditions. When C. tyrobutyricum was inoculated into mango pulp with bovicin HC5, gas production was not observed. Cultures that were successively transferred in the presence of sublethal doses of bovicin HC5 did not become resistant. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of bovicin HC5 to mango pulp might be effective in preventing deterioration by spoilage bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Bovicin HC5 and nisin have the potential to increase the shelf life of canned fruit pulps.
TI  - Repeated meningitis as a delayed complication of scoliosis surgery.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Case report. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of very delayed repeated meningitis after surgical treatment of scoliosis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Delayed infection after spine surgery is a well-reported phenomenon, presenting usually with local wound symptoms and back pain. The occurrence of meningitis after spinal instrumentation is reported but not common. Delayed repeated episodes of meningitis after surgical treatment of scoliosis have never been reported. CASE REPORT: We report a case of a 44-year-old gentleman, submitted to surgical treatment of scoliosis years ago, who presented with repeated episodes of meningitis due to the formation of an abnormal communication between an infected cyst in the bone cavity where the rods were located and the intradural space in the lumbar spine. Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed the presence of a bone cyst with thickened layering, and surgical exploration revealed the communication between this cystic cavity and the intradural space. After surgical closure of the dural space and cleaning of the cyst, the patient responded well to antibiotic therapy and was free of new episodes of meningitis up to the last follow-up, 1 year after the surgical treatment. Clinical diagnosis of delayed postoperative infection in spine surgery may be difficult if no wound signs are present. Clinical symptoms vary and may include increased back pain, wound redness, swelling and drainage, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and white blood count, fever, and malaise. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed meningitis can be a late complication of spinal instrumentation for scoliosis. A high index of suspicion is necessary.
TI  - Association of tannase-producing Staphylococcus lugdunensis with colon cancer and characterization of a novel tannase gene.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between Streptococcus (St.) bovis endocarditis and colon cancer is well known. In St. bovis, the biotype I strain (formerly, St. gallolyticus) produces tannase that degrades tannins. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of tannase-producing bacteria with colon cancer, and to identify the major tannase-producing bacteria and the gene involved. METHODS: Tannase-producing bacteria were isolated in tannic acid-treated selective agar medium from feces and rectal swabs of 357 patients who underwent colon endoscopy from 1999 to 2004. RESULTS: Tannase-producing bacteria were isolated more frequently from the colon cancer group (24.3%) than from the adenoma or normal groups (14.4%; P < 0.05). S. gallolyticus, Staphylococcus (S.) lugdunensis, Lactobacillus (L.) plantarum, and L. pentosus were all identified as tannase-producing bacteria. Of these, S. lugdunensis was significantly isolated from the advanced-stage cancer group (22.2%; P < 0.001) more than from the early-stage cancer (8.6%) or adenoma (4.9%) groups. The gene (tanA) for tannase in S. lugdunensis was cloned and sequenced. The tanA gene was associated with all S. lugdunensis but not with other bacteria by Southern blotting and polymerase chain reaction. CONCLUSIONS: Tannase-producing S. lugdunensis is associated with advanced-stage colon cancer, and the tanA gene is a useful marker for the detection of S. lugdunensis.
TI  - Characteristics and regional variations of group D streptococcal endocarditis in  France.
AB  - The proportion of infective endocarditis (IE) caused by group D streptococci (GDS; formerly Streptococcus bovis) increased markedly in France, to account for 25% of all cases of IE by 1999. In an attempt to explain this phenomenon, a comparative analysis of GDS and oral streptococci (OS) causing IE was performed. This study was based on data collected from a large cross-sectional population-based survey that was conducted in 1999. In total, 559 cases of definite IE were recorded, of which 142 involved GDS and 79 involved OS. Patients with GDS IE were older (62.7 vs. 56.6 years, p 0.01) and had a history of valve disease less frequently than did patients with OS IE (33.8% vs. 67.1%, p <0.0001). At-risk procedures for IE were performed less frequently in patients with GDS than in patients with OS (14.8% vs. 24.1%, p 0.08), but co-morbidities were more frequent in the GDS group (59.9% vs. 32.9%, p 0.0001). Diabetes, colon diseases and cirrhosis were also more frequent in the GDS group (p 0.006, p <0.0001 and p 0.08, respectively). Rural residents accounted for 31.0% of the GDS group, but for only 15.2% of the OS group (p 0.001). Likewise, the proportion of GDS IE was higher in regions with mixed (urban and rural) populations (Franche-Comte 81.8%, Marne 68.7%, Lorraine 70.3% and Rhone-Alpes 65.3%) than in exclusively urban regions (Paris and Ile de France 58.0%). Further investigations are required to elucidate the link in France between the incidence of GDS IE, rural residency and nutritional factors.

TI  - Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus septicaemia in goslings.
AB  - Increased mortality was observed in a group of 2-3-week old goslings. At post mortem examination, gross lesions included congestion and haemorrhages in the viscera. Histopathological lesions included generalised congestion of tissues with multifocal bacterial colonies, an acute septic fibrinoid splenitis, and an acute septic hepatitis, all consistent with acute septicaemia. Gram-stained sections of liver and lung confirmed the presence of Gram-positive bacteria and Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (Streptococcus bovis biotype II/2) was isolated in pure growth from two of the goslings, and in mixed growth from a third.
TI  - Pyogenic liver abscess presenting after malignant polypectomy.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis bacteremia has been linked to the presence of occult colon cancer since 1977. We present a case of pyogenic liver abscess and bacteremia with a different Streptococcus viridans 1 week after colonic adenocarcinoma was removed via polypectomy, discuss the likely etiology and review whether there is evidence to support looking for colon cancer in patients who present similarly but have not already undergone screening.
TI  - Improvement in lactic acid production from starch using alpha-amylase-secreting Lactococcus lactis cells adapted to maltose or starch.
AB  - To achieve direct and efficient lactic acid production from starch, a genetically modified Lactococcus lactis IL 1403 secreting alpha-amylase, which was obtained from Streptococcus bovis 148, was constructed. Using this strain, the fermentation of soluble starch was achieved, although its rate was far from efficient (0.09 g l(-1) h(-1) lactate). High-performance liquid chromatography revealed that maltose accumulated during fermentation, and this was thought to lead to inefficient fermentation. To accelerate maltose consumption, starch fermentation was examined using L. lactis cells adapted to maltose instead of glucose. This led to a decrease in the amount of maltose accumulation in the culture, and, as a result, a more rapid fermentation was accomplished (1.31 g l(-1) h(-1) lactate). Maximum volumetric lactate productivity was further increased (1.57 g l(-1) h(-1) lactate) using cells adapted to starch, and a high yield of lactate (0.89 g of lactate per gram of consumed sugar) of high optical purity (99.2% of L: -lactate) was achieved. In this study, we propose a new approach to lactate production by alpha-amylase-secreting L. lactis that allows efficient fermentation from starch using cells adapted to maltose or starch before fermentation.
TI  - Effect of bovicin HC5 on growth and spore germination of Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis isolated from spoiled mango pulp.
AB  - AIMS: To use bovicin HC5 to inhibit predominant bacteria isolated from spoiled mango pulp. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bovicin HC5 and nisin were added to brain heart infusion (BHI) medium (40-160 AU ml(-1)) or mango pulp (100 AU ml(-1)) and the growth of Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis was monitored. Cultures treated with bovicin HC5 or nisin showed longer lag phases and grew slower in BHI medium. Bovicin HC5 and nisin were bactericidal and showed higher activity in mango pulp at acidic pH values. To determine the effect on spore germination and D values, mango pulp containing bovicin HC5 was inoculated with 10(6) and 10(9) spores per ml(-1), respectively, from each strain tested. Bovicin HC5 reduced the outgrowth of spores from B. cereus and B. thuringiensis, but thermal sensitivity was not affected. CONCLUSIONS: Bovicin HC5 was bactericidal against B. cereus and B. thuringiensis isolated from spoiled mango pulp. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Bacillus cereus and B. thuringiensis had not been previously isolated from spoiled mango pulp and bovicin HC5 has the potential to inhibit such bacteria in fruit pulps.
TI  - Characterization of a bacteriocin, Thermophilin 1277, produced by Streptococcus thermophilus SBT1277.
AB  - AIMS: To assess the inhibitory activity and the influence of culture condition on the growth and bacteriocin, Thermophilin 1277, production by Streptococcus thermophilus SBT1277. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thermophilin 1277, which was produced by S. thermophilus SBT1277, showed an antimicrobial activity against several lactic acid bacteria and food spoilage bacteria including Clostridium butylicum, C. sprogenes and Bacillus cereus. Thermophilin 1277 was inactivated by proteinase K. Heating treatment did not affect the antimicrobial activity. The partially purified Thermophilin 1277 had an apparent molecular mass of 3.7 kDa. N-terminal sequence analysis revealed 15 amino acid residues that correspond with amino acid sequence of the lantibiotics bovicin HJ50 produced by Streptococcus bovis HJ50. The effects of culture condition for the bacteriocin production by S. thermophilus SBT1277 were studied. During the batch fermentation, Thermophilin 1277 was produced in M17 broth, but no bacteriocin production occurred in the sucrose-tryptone (ST) broth. Bacteriocin production was detected in pH controlled ST broth at pH values of 5.5-6.5. CONCLUSIONS: Thermophilin 1277 production from S. thermophilus strain depended on the culture conditions. Some characters and N-terminal amino acid sequence of Thermophilin 1277 differed from bacteriocins produced by S. thermophilus reported previously. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Streptococcus thermophilus SBT1277 or its bacteriocin which has a wide inhibitory spectrum has a potential use as a biopreservative in dairy products.

TI  - Identification of glucose-fermenting bacteria present in an in vitro model of the human intestine by RNA-stable isotope probing.
AB  - 16S rRNA-based stable isotope probing (SIP) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)  spectroscopy-based metabolic profiling were used to identify bacteria fermenting glucose under conditions simulating the human intestine. The TIM-2 in vitro model of the human intestine was inoculated with a GI tract microbiota resembling that of the small intestine, to which subsequently 4, 20 or 40 mM of [U-(13)C]-glucose were added. RNA was extracted from lumen samples after 0 (control), 1, 2 and 4 h and subjected to density-gradient ultracentrifugation. Phylogenetic analysis of unlabeled 16S rRNA revealed a microbial community dominated by lactic acid bacteria and Clostridium perfringens. Distinct (13)C-incorporation into bacterial RNA was only observed for the 40-mM addition. 16S rRNA fingerprinting showed an activity drop of Lactobacillus fermentum after glucose addition, while Streptococcus bovis and C. perfringens were identified as the most active glucose-fermenters. Accordingly, NMR analysis identified lactate, acetate, butyrate and formate as the principal fermentation products, constituting up to 91% of the (13)C-carbon balance. RNA-SIP combined with metabolic profiling allowed us to detect differential utilization of a general model carbohydrate, indicating that this approach holds great potential to identify bacteria involved in the fermentation of dietary relevant oligo- and polymeric carbohydrates in the human intestine.

This report describes a 46-year-old woman who presented with infectious endocarditis caused by S. bovis associated with colonic tubular-villous adenoma. Demonstration of bacterial DNA by polymerase chain reaction and identification by DNA sequencing was performed to establish the diagnosis.
TI  - Colon cancer presenting as Streptococcus gallolyticus infective endocarditis.
AB  - A 58-year-old Chinese man presented with a three-week history of fever. He had a  background history of rheumatic heart disease, hypertension, and thalassaemia. He was found to have infective endocarditis of the aortic valve due to Streptococcus gallolyticus. During the hospital stay, he developed a few episodes of haematochaezia and was subsequently found to have colonic carcinomain- situ. He completed appropriate antibiotic treatment for his infective endocarditis and underwent a left hemicolectomy with primary anastomosis. The association between Streptococcus gallolyticus infective endocarditis and colonic neoplasm is well documented. This case report stresses the importance of performing routine colonoscopy to look for colonic neoplastic change in patients diagnosed to have Streptococcus gallolyticus infective endocarditis. The early diagnosis of the colonic neoplasm has enabled our patient to have a curative surgery without compromising his quality of life.
TI  - Adherence and efficacy of an external teat sealant to prevent new intramammary infections in the dry period.
AB  - The efficacy and adherence of an external teat sealant applied at drying off was  evaluated in 2 studies between 1997 and 1999. At drying off, 2 quarters were randomized to receive intramammary dry-cow antibiotic therapy, and the remaining 2 quarters were treated with either a single or double application of external teat sealant. Approximately 3 d before calving, all teats that had been dipped at drying off were redipped in a single coating of teat sealant. Adherence of the teat sealant was scored for the first 2 wk after drying off, and physical traits of the teat skin and teat ends were recorded. Quarter milk samples were collected 1 wk before drying off, at drying off, 0 to 7 d, and 14 to 21 d postcalving. Somatic cell counts were determined from quarter samples taken at d 7 and 14 to 21 d after calving. Data were analyzed from 172 dry periods of 162 cows. The mean time of sealant adherence following drying off application was 3 +/- 0.13 d. Double sealant application significantly increased the duration of adherence by 0.67 d. Teats that had teat sealant applied twice at drying off and that had up to 3 d of adherence had the lowest linear score (LS) at 14 to 21 d (1.89 +/- 0.31) of all quarters. The LS of quarters that received antibiotic therapy only was 2.27 +/- 0.19. The majority of intramammary infections identified at drying off were caused by the minor pathogens, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Corynebacterium bovis (51 and 23%, respectively). The results from this study indicate that duration of sealant adherence to the teat-end should be considered when evaluating the impact of teat sealant treatment at drying off on the level of infection after calving. Double sealant application, cooler seasons, and longer teat lengths were associated with a significant increase in the duration of sealant adherence to the teat-end.

TI  - Dominance of Prevotella and low abundance of classical ruminal bacterial species  in the bovine rumen revealed by relative quantification real-time PCR.
AB  - Relative quantification real-time PCR was used to quantify several bacterial species in ruminal samples from two lactating cows, each sampled 3 h after feeding on two successive days. Abundance of each target taxon was calculated as a fraction of the total 16S rRNA gene copies in the samples, using taxon-specific and eubacterial domain-level primers. Bacterial populations showed a clear predominance of members of the genus Prevotella, which comprised 42% to 60% of the bacterial rRNA gene copies in the samples. However, only 2% to 4% of the bacterial rRNA gene copies were represented by the classical ruminal Prevotella species Prevotella bryantii, Prevotella ruminicola and Prevotella brevis. The proportion of rRNA gene copies attributable to Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Selenomonas ruminantium and Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were each generally in the 0.5% to 1% range. Proportions for Ruminobacter amylophilus and Eubacterium ruminantium were lower (0.1% to 0.2%), while Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Streptococcus bovis, Ruminococcus albus and Megasphaera elsdenii were even less abundant, each comprising <0.03% of the bacterial rRNA gene copies. The data suggest that the aggregate abundance of the most intensively studied ruminal bacterial species is relatively low and that a large fraction of the uncultured population represents a single bacterial genus.
TI  - Production of L-Lysine from starch by Corynebacterium glutamicum displaying alpha-amylase on its cell surface.
AB  - We engineered a Corynebacterium glutamicum strain displaying alpha-amylase from Streptococcus bovis 148 (AmyA) on its cell surface to produce amino acids directly from starch. We used PgsA from Bacillus subtilis as an anchor protein, and the N-terminus of alpha-amylase was fused to the PgsA. The genes of the fusion protein were integrated into the homoserine dehydrogenase gene locus on the chromosome by homologous recombination. L-Lysine fermentation was carried out using C. glutamicum displaying AmyA in the growth medium containing 50 g/l soluble starch as the sole carbon source. We performed L-lysine fermentation at various temperatures (30-40 degrees C) and pHs (6.0-7.0), as the optimal temperatures and pHs of AmyA and C. glutamicum differ significantly. The highest L-lysine yield was recorded at 30 degrees C and pH 7.0. The amount of soluble starch was reduced to 18.29 g/l, and 6.04 g/l L-lysine was produced in 24 h. The L-lysine yield obtained using soluble starch as the sole carbon source was higher than that using glucose as the sole carbon source after 24 h when the same amount of substrates was added. The results shown in the current study demonstrate that C. glutamicum displaying alpha-amylase has a potential to directly convert soluble starch to amino acids.
TI  - Identification of alpha-hemolytic streptococci by pyrosequencing the 16S rRNA gene and by use of VITEK 2.
AB  - Alpha-hemolytic streptococci are very difficult to identify by phenotypic methods. In this study, a pyrosequencing method for the identification of streptococcal species based on two variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene is described. Almost all studied streptococcal species (n = 51) represented by their type strains could be differentiated except for some closely related species of the Streptococcus bovis or S. salivarius group. The pyrosequencing results of alpha-hemolytic streptococci isolated from blood (n = 99) or from the normal pharyngeal microbiota (n = 25) were compared to the results obtained by the VITEK 2 with GP card (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). As expected, the results of the two methods did not completely agree, but 93 (75.0%) of the isolates assigned to the same streptococcal group by both methods and 57 (46.0%) reached consistent results at the species level. However, 10 strains remained unidentified by VITEK 2, and 4 isolates could not be assigned to any streptococcal group by pyrosequencing. Identification of members of the S. mitis and S. sanguinis groups proved difficult for both methods. Furthermore, the pyrosequencing analysis revealed great sequence variation, since only 43 (32.3%) of the 133 isolates analyzed by pyrosequencing had sequences identical to a type strain. The variation was greatest in the pharyngeal isolates, slightly lower in the blood culture isolates, and nonexistent in invasive pneumococcal isolates (n = 17) that all had the S. pneumoniae type strain sequence. The resolution of the results obtained by the two methods is impeded by the lack of a proper gold standard.
TI  - Geno- and phenotypic diversity of avian isolates of Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (Streptococcus bovis) and associated diagnostic problems.
AB  - Recently, strains of Streptococcus bovis were reclassified as Streptococcus gallolyticus. In the present study we describe for the first time an outbreak of S. gallolyticus in a broiler flock. Mortality during the first week was normal (<1%), with a final total mortality at the end of production reaching 4.3%. Specific symptoms were not observed. Postmortem pathology demonstrated enlarged and light spleens and livers accompanied by multifocal irregular necroses surrounded by a hemorrhagic zone. In addition, these birds suffered from arthritis and osteomyelitis. Strains isolated from liver and spleen lesions showed clonality as demonstrated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Compared to strains representing previously derived phylogeny, including the S. bovis-S. equinus complex, the 16S rRNA-derived phylogeny of the strains investigated in this study demonstrated a paraphyletic group (S. gallolyticus) well separated from two monophyletic groups: (i) S. equinus-S. bovis plus S. infantarius and (ii) S. alactolyticus plus S. intestinalis. According to information in GenBank, none of the strains included from the two monophyletic groups have been isolated from birds. Further biochemical analyses, including tannase activity, identified for the first time avian isolates belonging to S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus. However, these investigations also demonstrated a clear heterogeneity with pigeon isolates.
TI  - Gemella endocarditis: consider the colon.
AB  - Gemella species, including Gemella morbillorum, are part of the normal flora of the human oropharynx, upper respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract. Differentiation of Gemella from viridans streptococci in the laboratory may be difficult. Although uncommonly pathogenic, they have been implicated in a variety of human infections, most notably infective endocarditis. Dental instrumentation appears to be the usual source of infection. The case is reported of Gemella morbillorum native valve endocarditis, which was associated with an underlying colonic carcinoma. An association with colonic neoplasm has been described in three previous cases of endocarditis attributed to Gemella. It is well documented that Streptococcus bovis endocarditis may occur in the setting of colonic neoplasia. It is suggested that colonic investigation should be considered in patients with Gemella endocarditis, in whom no other source is apparent.
TI  - Bacterial competition between a bacteriocin-producing and a bacteriocin-negative  strain of Streptococcus bovis in batch and continuous culture.
AB  - A bacteriocin-producing Streptococcus bovis strain (HC5) outcompeted a sensitive  strain (JB1) before it reached stationary phase (pH 6.4), even though it grew 10% slower and cell-free bovicin HC5 could not yet be detected. The success of bacteriocin-negative S. bovis isolates was enhanced by the presence of another sensitive bacterium (Clostridium sticklandii SR). PCR based on repetitive DNA sequences indicated that S. bovis HC5 was not simply transferring bacteriocin genes to S. bovis JB1. When the two S. bovis strains were coinoculated into minimal medium, bacteriocin-negative isolates predominated, and this effect could be explained by the longer lag time (0.5 vs. 1.5 h) of S. bovis HC5. If the glucose concentration of the minimal medium was increased from 2 to 7 mg mL(-1), the effect of lag time was diminished and bacteriocin-producing isolates once again dominated the coculture. When the competition was examined in continuous culture, it became apparent that batch culture inocula were never able to displace a strain that had already reached steady state, even if the inoculum was large. This result indicated that bacterial selection for substrate affinity was even more important than bacteriocin production.
TI  - [The importance of Streptococcus bovis systemic infections].
AB  - Streptococcus bovis is relatively common cause of bacteremia and endocarditis, especially in older persons, or in patients that have some kind of chronic disease. These infections are frequently connected with malignant, potentially malignant, or benign colorectal neoplasia. Hematogenous dissemination of Streptococcus bovis could result with various clinical manifestations, namely purulent meningitis, brain abscess, osteomyelitis, spondylodiscitis, and many different kinds of infections in AIDS patients are reported. In this report, two patients hospitalized at the Departement of Infectious Diseases at the General Hospital "Dr. Josip Bencevic" in Slavonski Brod are presented. The first patient was addmited to the hospital because of fever of unknown origin, and in his blood cultures, Streptococcus bovis was isolated. He was an older man, who had undergone prostatectomy due prostatic adenoma several years before. The other patient, previously completely healthy younger man, suffered purulent meningitis caused by the same microorganism. Colon endoscopy was performed in both patients and it revealed colon polyps. Histologically, in both cases, those were benign neoplasia. In Croatia, until this report, there have been no other reports about patients suffering systemic Streptococcus bovis infections. At the same time, this report describes Streptococcus bovis purulent meningitis in a previously healthy adult, which is also extremely rare in the medical literature. Since Streptococcus bovis infections are associated with colon carcinoma, it is imperative to perform colonoscopy in each patient suffering infection with this germ, and to consider him as a high risk patient for developing colon cancer.
TI  - Successful treatment of polymicrobial multivalve infective endocarditis. Multivalve infective endocarditis.
AB  - A 57-year-old man presented with triple valve infective endocarditis. There were  vegetations on the tricuspid, mitral, and aortic valve. He had multiple complications such as pulmonary abscess, severe anaemia, and congestive heart failure. His general condition was extremely poor. Intensive medical therapy, such as blood transfusion, mechanical ventilation, and inotropic support, allowed him to tolerate surgery. Triple valve replacement was successfully performed without major complication. Vegetation cultures grew Streptococcus bovis and Enterecoccus faecalis. At 1 year follow-up, the patient is alive in NYHA functional class I.

TI  - Late Streptococcus bovis infection of knee arthroplasty and its association with  carcinoma of the colon: a case report.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis is a very rare cause of infection of joint arthroplasty. Infections with S. bovis have been reported to be associated with various gastrointestinal conditions. We present a case of total knee arthroplasty infected with S. bovis 40 months after a successful knee replacement. The diagnosis was established on joint fluid as well as blood cultures. Early diagnosis, arthroscopic wash out and appropriate antibiotics helped salvage the prosthesis. Early colonoscopy revealed carcinoma of the sigmoid colon that was surgically resected.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis Infection in young Infants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sporadic cases of invasive Streptococcus bovis disease have been reported in young infants. However, little is known about the clinical manifestations or the conditions that predispose to S. bovis infection in this population. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this case series and review of the literature was to describe cases of S. bovis infection treated at 2 children's hospitals and compare patients evaluated at our institutions with those reported in the literature. RESULTS: Seven infants with S. bovis infection were treated at our institutions; 4 of the patients had S. bovis meningitis and 3 of these also had S. bovis bacteremia. Five of the patients had signs of gastrointestinal disturbance at presentation. None of the 7 patients died. Twenty-three patients with S. bovis infection reported in the literature had meningitis with concurrent bacteremia (n = 9), bacteremia alone (n = 9), meningitis alone (n = 4), and pneumonia with overwhelming sepsis (n = 1). Six (26%) of the patients reported in the literature died as a consequence of S. bovis infection. The difference in median age between our patients (14 days; range, 1-43 days) and those reported in the literature (3 days; range, 1-60 days) was not statistically significant (P = 0.49). Abdominal distention was more commonly noted among patients in our series (71%) than among patients reported in the literature (10%; odds ratio = 21.3; 95% confidence interval = 1.7-319.0). CONCLUSIONS: Bacteremia and meningitis were the most common manifestations. Gastrointestinal disturbance was common among patients in our series. The mortality rate from S. bovis infection appears to be lower than suggested by previous reports.
TI  - Activity of DX-619 compared to other agents against viridans group streptococci,  Streptococcus bovis, and Cardiobacterium hominis.
AB  - Against 198 viridans group streptococci, 25 Streptococcus bovis strains, and 5 Cardiobacterium hominis strains, MICs of DX-619, a des-F(6)-quinolone, were between 0.004 and 0.25 microg/ml. These MICs were lower than those of other quinolones (< or = 0.008 to > 32 microg/ml). Beta-lactam MICs were between < or = 0.008 and 16 microg/ml. Azithromycin resistance was found in most species, while most were telithromycin susceptible. Glycopeptides and linezolid were active against viridans group strains but inactive against C. hominis.
TI  - Simultaneously performed mitral valve replacement and Hartmann's operation for infectious endocarditis from Streptococcus bovis and rectal cancer.
AB  - In patients with surgical indications for both cardiac surgery and a malignant neoplasm, cardiac surgery should generally be performed first; however, in some cases simultaneous surgery is recommended. We report a case of infectious endocarditis of the mitral valve caused by Streptococcus bovis with rectal cancer. Blood cultures showed a rise in coagulase-negative S. bovis, and the source of infection was thought to be the rectal cancer. The patient presented with cerebral infarction prior to surgery, and the possibility of recurrence of an infarction was predicted. The tumor of the rectum was hemorrhagic, so to avoid hemorrhagic complications due to perioperative heparinization and anticoagulant therapy and to remove the source of infection, mitral valve replacement and a Hartmann's operation were performed simultaneously. The postoperative course was uneventful.
TI  - The effect of calcium and magnesium on the activity of bovicin HC5 and nisin.
AB  - Some Gram-positive bacteria produce small peptides (bacteriocins) that have antimicrobial activity, but many bacteria can become bacteriocin resistant. Bovicin HC5, a lantibiotic produced by Streptococcus bovis HC5, has the ability to inhibit nisin-resistant bacteria. Because nisin resistance has in many cases been correlated with an alteration of lipoteichoic acids or the polar head groups of membrane phospholipids, we decided to examine the effect of divalent cations on nisin and bovicin HC5 activity. Both bacteriocins catalyzed potassium efflux from S. bovis JB1, a non-bacteriocin-producing strain. The addition of large amounts (100 mM) of calcium or magnesium increased the ability of S. bovis JB1 to bind Congo red (an anionic dye) and counteracted bacteriocin-mediated potassium loss. Calcium was more effective than magnesium in decreasing nisin activity, but the reverse was observed with bovicin HC5. Nisin-resistant S. bovis JB1 cells bound three times as much Congo red as nisin-sensitive cells, and this result is consistent with the idea that changes in cell surface charge can be a mechanism of bacteriocin resistance. The nisin-resistant cells were less susceptible to bovicin HC5, but bovicin HC5 still caused a 50% depletion of intracellular potassium. These results indicate that nisin and bovicin HC5 react differently with the cell surfaces of Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Streptococcus suis endocarditis and colon carcinoma: a case report.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis has classically been associated with colorectal carcinomas in literature. Curiously enough, no other Streptococcus species have hitherto been associated with such a malignancy or any other tumors. This report presents a case of early-stage colorectal carcinoma diagnosed in a patient with infection with the related Streptococcus species S suis. A discussion of possible pathogenetic implications follows.
TI  - Streptococcal PD peritonitis--a 10-year review of one centre's experience.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Detailed descriptive studies focusing on streptococcal peritonitis in patients on peritoneal dialysis are lacking. Most of the current information is available through isolated case reports. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of our peritoneal dialysis (PD) peritonitis database over the last decade to study the clinical profile and treatment outcomes of streptococcal peritonitis. RESULTS: A total of 68 patients (age: 57.12 +/- 16.6 years; male: 58.7%) with 104 episodes of streptococcal peritonitis (11.7% of total peritonitis) were identified. Of the patients, 18 (26.4%) were considered immunocompromised [failed renal transplant, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)] and 28 (41.1%) had diabetes. Streptococcus viridans accounted for the majority (94 episodes: 90.3%) of the streptococcal peritonitis. One patient developed S. viridans peritonitis after dental cleaning without antibiotic prophylaxis. Two (1.9%) infections with S. agalactiae and S. bovis each and seven (6.7%) with non-haemolytic Streptococcus were noted. Three patients had hospital-acquired infection. Twenty-six (25%) episodes needed 8 +/- 5.9 days of hospitalization. Concurrent infection with two organisms accounted for 17 (16.3%) episodes. Cefazolin (71) and vancomycin (29) were the primary antibiotics used for the treatment. Five episodes needed two antibiotics and one patient required antifungal treatment. A third of the patients (33.3%) had peritonitis that resolved slowly, although the majority of those (94%) did ultimately resolve with antibiotics alone. Five (4.8%) episodes required removal of the PD catheter. Three of them were associated with dual infections (one each with yeast, Stenotrophomonas and Enterococcus). Relapse occurred in eight (7.6%) episodes, and 11 (10.5%) recurred over the period from 4 weeks to 6 months after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Streptococci remain a significant cause of PD peritonitis. Viridans strep is the primary subtype responsible. Isolated infections with these organisms are associated with slower response, good outcome and higher rates of recurrence.
TI  - Tigecycline (GAR-936) activity against Streptococcus gallolyticus (bovis) and viridans group streptococci.
AB  - Viridans group streptococci including Streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly S. bovis) represent serious invasive pathogens often associated with endocarditis or sepsis among immunocompromised or cancer patients. Tigecycline (GAR-936), the first clinically studied glycylcycline, has a potent gram-positive activity with a potential treatment option for these streptococcal infections. The studied collection (848 strains) included 100 isolates each of Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, and fewer strains of S. gallolyticus (98 strains) and Streptococcus mutans (50 strains). These strains were isolated from patients on 3 continents in the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program and tested for susceptibility and interpreted by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute broth microdilution methods and criteria (< or = 0.25 microg/mL for tigecycline per US Food and Drug Administration). Penicillin susceptibility rates for the entire collection varied from 61% (S. sanguis) to 98% (S. constellatus), and macrolide susceptibility was also compromised (49-88%; average, 69%). Tigecycline was active against all isolates tested, in contrast to tetracycline resistance rates of 8-66%, and highest for S. gallolyticus. In conclusion tigecycline was quite active against bacteremic isolates of viridans group streptococci species and S. gallolyticus with an overall MIC90 at < or = 0.06 microg/mL; the highest MIC was only 0.25 microg/mL.
TI  - Identification of an erm(T) gene in strains of inducibly clindamycin-resistant group B Streptococcus.
AB  - Five inducibly clindamycin (CLI)-resistant group B Streptococcus (GBS) isolates,  all negative for erm(A) and erm(B) genes, were found to contain erm(T), a gene previously reported in erythromycin-resistant animal isolates of Lactobacillus spp. and human isolates of Streptococcus bovis. One additional GBS isolate, constitutively resistant to CLI, was also positive for the erm(T) gene in addition to erm(B). To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of erm(T) in GBS, the 2nd bacterial species from humans in which the erm(T) gene has been identified, and the 3rd erm gene to be found in GBS.
TI  - In vitro bacterial growth and in vivo ruminal microbiota populations associated with bloat in steers grazing wheat forage.
AB  - The role of ruminal bacteria in the frothy bloat complex common to cattle grazing winter wheat has not been previously determined. Two experiments, one in vitro and another in vivo, were designed to elucidate the effects of fresh wheat forage on bacterial growth, biofilm complexes, rumen fermentation end products, rumen bacterial diversity, and bloat potential. In Exp. 1, 6 strains of ruminal bacteria (Streptococcus bovis strain 26, Prevotella ruminicola strain 23, Eubacterium ruminantium B1C23, Ruminococcus albus SY3, Fibrobacter succinogenes ssp. S85, and Ruminococcus flavefaciens C94) were used in vitro to determine the effect of soluble plant protein from winter wheat forage on specific bacterial growth rate, biofilm complexes, VFA, and ruminal H2 and CH4 in mono or coculture with Methanobrevibacter smithii. The specific growth rate in plant protein medium containing soluble plant protein (3.27% nitrogen) was measured during a 24-h incubation at 39 degrees C in Hungate tubes under a CO2 gas phase. A monoculture of M. smithii was grown similarly, except under H2:CO2 (1:1), in a basal methanogen growth medium supplemented likewise with soluble plant protein. In Exp. 2, 6 ruminally cannulated steers grazing wheat forage were used to evaluate the influence of bloat on the production of biofilm complexes, ruminal microbial biodiversity patterns, and ruminal fluid protein fractions. In Exp. 1, cultures of R. albus (P < 0.01) and R. flavefaciens (P < 0.05) produced the most H2 among strains and resulted in greater (P < 0.01) CH4 production when cocultured with M. smithii than other coculture combinations. Cultures of S. bovis and E. ruminantium + M. smithii produced the most biofilm mass among strains. In Exp. 2, when diets changed from bermudagrass hay to wheat forage, biofilm production increased (P < 0.01). Biofilm production, concentrations of whole ruminal content (P < 0.01), and cheesecloth filtrate protein fractions (P < 0.05) in the ruminal fluid were greater on d 50 for bloated than for nonbloated steers when grazing wheat forage. The molecular analysis of the 16S rDNA showed that 2 different ruminal microbiota populations developed between bloated and nonbloated animals grazing wheat forage. Bloat in cattle grazing wheat pastures may be caused by increased production of biofilm, resulting from a diet-influenced switch in the rumen bacterial population.

TI  - Potential pathogens carried by Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica hispanica) in southern Spain.
AB  - The Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica hispanica) population of southern Spain was surveyed for potential pathogens associated with the conjunctiva, external ear canal, as well as reproductive and upper respiratory tracts. We sampled 321 ibex (131 adult males, 100 adult females, and 90 yearlings); these included 271 apparently healthy animals and 50 that were naturally infected with Sarcoptes scabiei. A total of 688 bacterial isolates were identified (377 gram-negatives, 225 gram-positives, and 86 Mycoplasma spp.); sex, age, location, infection with S. scabiei, and disposition of the animal (free-ranging versus captive) were evaluated as risk factors for infection. Infections with Mycoplasma agalactiae and Mycoplasma arginini were associated with age, having a higher frequency of isolation in young animals. With Escherichia coli, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida biotype A, and Staphylococcus aureus, significantly higher isolation rates were associated with adults. The isolation frequency for E. coli was higher in females, whereas Moraxella bovis isolations were mostly associated with males. The presence of mange increased the risk of infection with both Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus and M. haemolytica. The geographic origin of sampled animals was related to the isolation of Branhamella ovis, M. agalactiae, and all Pasteurella sp. Isolations of M. haemolytica, P. multocida biotype A, E. coli, and B. ovis were more prevalent in samples from free-ranging rather than captive animals. Of the gram-positive bacteria, S. aureus represented the predominant species isolated from nasal, vaginal, and ocular samples. Mycoplasma agalactiae and M. arginini were the predominant Mycoplasma spp., and both were associated most often with the external ear canal. The most frequently isolated gram-negative bacteria included E. coli, M. haemolytica, P. multocida biotype A, and B. ovis. Isolation rates of gram-negative species varied by source. In nasal samples, M. haemolytica and P. multocida biotype A were isolated most frequently, whereas in ocular and vaginal samples, B. ovis and E. coli, respectively, were most frequently isolated.
TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease and Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - Evidence suggests a trend for a higher fecal carriage rate of Streptococcus bovis in adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study defines the fecal carriage rate of S. bovis among children with IBD compared to controls. Subjects with IBD were prospectively enrolled from the patient population of a pediatric gastroenterology practice. Stool samples from IBD patients as well as controls were analyzed within 24 hr for the presence of S. bovis. The study enrolled 47 patients with IBD and 34 controls. Among the 47 IBD patients, 3 had a positive stool culture for S. bovis (6%) and 1 had an equivocal result between S. bovis and S. salivarius. Including this equivocal result, 8.5% of IBD patients were S. bovis carriers. Among the 34 controls, 3 (9%) were found to be fecal carriers of S. bovis. Assuming that the equivocal stool was indeed S. bovis, these groups are not statistically different as determined by Fisher's exact test (P=0.6). We conclude that the fecal carriage rate of S. bovis is not increased among pediatric patients with IBD compared with controls.
TI  - Effects of feeding polyclonal antibody preparations on ruminal bacterial populations and ruminal pH of steers fed high-grain diets.
AB  - Three experiments with factorial arrangements of treatments were designed to test the efficacy of avian-derived polyclonal antibody preparations (PAP) against Streptococcus bovis (PAP-Sb) or Fusobacterium necrophorum (PAP-Fn) in reducing ruminal counts of target bacteria in beef steers supplemented or not with feed additives (300 mg of monensin/d and 90 mg of tylosin/d; MT). Feeding increasing doses of PAP-Sb in Exp. 1 or a single dose in Exp. 2 reduced S. bovis counts in a cubic fashion (P = 0.014). In Exp. 1 and 2, inclusion of MT in the diet had no effect (P > 0.05) on ruminal S. bovis counts. In Exp. 2, ruminal pH was increased (P < 0.05) by feeding PAP-Sb, MT, and PAP-Sb plus MT. Ruminal F. necrophorum counts were reduced by feeding PAP-Fn (P = 0.002) and MT (P < 0.001). Reduction in ruminal F. necrophorum counts was greater (P = 0.008) when feeding MT alone than when feeding PAP-Fn and MT together. In Exp. 3, ruminal S. bovis counts were not affected (P = 0.64) by PAP-Fn. Ruminal pH was not affected (P = 0.61) by feeding PAP-Fn, and the total anaerobic bacterial count was not affected (P > 0.05) by either PAP-Sb or PAP-Fn in Exp. 1 or Exp. 3. In conclusion, PAP of avian origin and against S. bovis or F. necrophorum were effective in reducing target ruminal bacterial populations. These PAP could be effective in preventing the deleterious effects associated with these bacteria, and possibly in enhancing animal performance.
TI  - Unusual bacterial infections and colorectal carcinoma--Streptococcus bovis and Clostridium septicum: report of three cases.
AB  - Several types of unusual bacterial infections have been reported in association with colorectal malignancy. In the three cases described, uncommon infections resulted in further workup and subsequent resection for occult colonic malignancy. Awareness of this association is critical for early diagnosis and management.
TI  - Profiling the humoral immune response in colon cancer patients: diagnostic antigens from Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - The human bowel contains a large and dynamic bacterial population that is not only essential for intestinal health, but also critical for the development of diseases such as cancer. In this respect, the Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus bovis has been associated with colon cancer for many years. To investigate the clinical importance of this association, an immunocapture mass spectrometry assay was developed that can generate infection-related protein profiles. The composition of these profiles is governed by the capture of specific antigens by serum antibodies from colon cancer patients. This assay showed that S. bovis antigen profiles could distinguish 11 out of 12 colon cancer patients from 8 control subjects, whereas antigen profiles derived from the gut bacterium Escherichia coli were not diagnostic for colon cancer. Moreover, S. bovis antigen profiles were also detected in polyp patients, indicating that infection with this bacterium does occur early during carcinogenesis. Highly accurate tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify one of the diagnostic antigens as a surface-exposed heparin-binding protein, which might be involved in attachment of S. bovis to tumor cells. Together, these findings corroborate the hypothesis that colonic lesions provide a specific niche for S. bovis, resulting in tumor-associated "silent" infections. These infections, however, only become apparent in colon cancer patients with a compromised immune system (bacteremia) or coincidental cardiac valve lesions (endocarditis). This makes profiling of the humoral immune response against "silent" S. bovis infections a promising diagnostic tool for the early detection of human colon cancer, which is crucial for the effective treatment of this disease.
TI  - Prevalence of contagious mastitis pathogens in bulk tank milk in Prince Edward Island.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to 1) estimate the herd prevalence of contagious mastitis pathogens in bulk milk from Prince Edward Island (PEI) dairy farms, 2) determine the association between bulk milk culture results and mean bulk milk somatic cell count (BMSCC), and 3) investigate the agreement of repeated bulk milk cultures. Three consecutive bulk milk samples were obtained at weekly intervals from all 258 PEI dairy herds and were cultured using routine laboratory methods. Cumulative prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Mycoplasma spp. (M. bovis and M. alkalescens) was 74%, 1.6%, and 1.9%, respectively. Bulk milk somatic cell count of Staph. aureus-positive herds was higher than that of negative herds. Agreement for Staph. aureus isolation between 3 consecutive tests was moderate (kappa = 0.46). Mycoplasma bovis and M. alkalescens in bulk milk are being reported for the 1st time in PEI ever and in Canada since 1972.
TI  - Prevalence of mastitis pathogens and their resistance against antimicrobial agents in dairy cows in Brandenburg, Germany.
AB  - The primary objective of this study was to determine management practices concerning mastitis in Brandenburg, Germany, the prevalence of mastitis pathogens in dairy cows, and their resistance to selected antimicrobial agents. A further objective was to study the potential effect of parity and stage of lactation on the resistance of Staphylococcus aureus isolates against ampicillin. Milk samples for microbiological culture were collected from 4 groups of clinically healthy cows (first lactation, >1 lactation, >50 d in milk, and >250 d in milk; 8 cows/group) in 80 dairy herds. Resistance of gram-positive pathogens against 6 antimicrobial agents was tested using the broth microdilution method. Mastitis pathogens were isolated from 26.4% of the milk samples. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS, 9.1% of quarters) and Corynebacterium bovis (7.3%) were the pathogens most frequently isolated. Among the major pathogens, Staph. aureus (5.7%) and Streptococcus uberis (1.0%) had the highest prevalence. Streptococcus agalactiae was isolated in samples from 29% of the herds. Although the prevalence of most pathogens was higher in older cows, the prevalence of CNS was higher in primiparous cows. Results of the mastitis control questionnaire showed that cows with clinical mastitis were transferred to a sick cow pen in 70% of the herds. Cephalosporins were the drug of first choice for treatment of clinical mastitis cases followed by fixed combinations of antimicrobial agents, beta-lactamase-resistant penicillins, and penicillin. Most farmers treated cows 3 to 4 times per case. Cloxacillin, alone or in combination, and penicillin were most often used for dry-cow therapy. Antimicrobial resistance of the pathogens was within the range of other reports. Resistance of Staph. aureus to ampicillin increased significantly during the first lactation. Further research is required to determine the factors that lead to the selection of Staph. aureus strains that are resistant to ampicillin during the first lactation.
TI  - Aetiological diagnosis of infective endocarditis by direct amplification of rRNA  genes from surgically removed valve tissue. An 11-year experience in a Finnish teaching hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aetiology of infective endocarditis (IE) can be determined directly from surgically removed valve tissue using broad-range bacterial rDNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by sequencing. We sought to assess the value of this methodology in a routine clinical setting. METHODS: Broad-range PCR with primers targeting conserved bacterial rDNA sequences was applied to directly analyse valve samples from 56 patients operated on for diagnosed or suspected IE. Identification of the aetiological agent was performed by partial DNA sequencing of the 16S and 23S rDNA genes. RESULTS: The final diagnosis was definite IE in 36 patients and possible IE in 2 patients, while the diagnosis of IE was rejected in 18 patients. PCR analysis from removed valve tissue was positive in 25 patients with IE. Molecular identification was consistent with the blood culture finding in 20 of these patients. The PCR approach was the only method to yield the aetiological diagnosis in additional 4 patients (2 Staphylococcus species, 1 Streptococcus bovis, 1 Bartonella quintana), all of whom had received antimicrobials before blood cultures were taken. The mean duration of preoperative antimicrobial treatment for the patients with PCR-positive valves was 19.6 (range 1-58) days. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial DNA may persist during treatment in infected valves for long periods. The PCR method is especially useful when the causative agent of IE is fastidious or when the specimen is taken during antimicrobial treatment.
TI  - Isolation and identification of mixed linked beta -glucan degrading bacteria in the intestine of broiler chickens and partial characterization of respective 1,3-1,4-beta -glucanase activities.
AB  - Media with 1,3-1,4-beta -glucans as selective markers were used for isolation of  non-starch-polysaccharide (NSP) degrading bacteria from the intestinal tract of broiler chicken. Formerly unknown 1,3-1,4-beta endoglucanase activities in various bacterial species were identified in this study. E. faecium , Streptococcus , Bacteroides and Clostridium strains seem to be responsible for degradation of mixed linked beta -glucans in the small intestine and in the hind gut of chickens. Strict anaerobic bacteria (Bacteroides ovatus , B. uniformis , presumably B. capillosus and Clostridium perfringens ) as well as an unidentified bacterium with 98% 16S rDNA homology to an uncultered chicken cecum bacterium were isolated. Additionally, Streptococcus bovis with 1,3-1,4-beta -endoglucanase activity was also detected. Different 1,3-1,4-beta -endoglucanase activity profiles were observed in SDS/PAGE zymograms.

TI  - Evolution of surveillance methods for detection of bacterial contamination of platelets in a university hospital, 1991 through 2004.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Platelet (PLT) bacterial contamination (PBC) is the most common transfusion-associated infection. It is important to understand the impact of interventions addressing this problem. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: PBC was studied by prospective (active) and transfusion-reaction triggered (passive) surveillance from July 1991 to December 2004. Active surveillance, utilized for 10 years, included bacterial culture of all or 4- and 5-day-old PLTs at issue and intermittent use of Gram stain, pH measurements, and early (24-hr) culture of single-donor plateletpheresis (SDP) units. RESULTS: Active surveillance detected 38 instances of PBC, 7 in SDP units (1:2213) and 31 in random-donor PLT units (1:2090 units, p = 0.89; or 1:418 pools of 5 units, p < 0.001). Contaminants were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS; n = 27), Staphylococcus aureus (4), Bacillus cereus (1), Serratia marcescens (2), streptococci (2 S. bovis, 1 S. uberis), and CONS with viridans group streptococcus (1). Only one instance of contamination, caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was detected by passive surveillance, with fatal outcome. Colony counts of contaminants ranged from 0.5 x 10(2) to 4 x 10(11) colony-forming units per mL at time of issue. PBC was interdicted before transfusion in 6 cases through Gram stain screening. Transfusion reactions occurred in 13 of 32 recipients (41%), with 9 severe reactions (28%) and 3 deaths (9%). pH testing failed to detect 5 contaminated units and resulted in discard of nearly 2 percent of units, whereas culture of SDP units at 24 hours failed to identify a contaminated unit. CONCLUSION: Improved active surveillance methods for detecting PBC are needed to improve the safety of PLT transfusions.
TI  - Nocardia brain abscesses in a male patient with SLE: successful outcome despite delay in diagnosis.
AB  - We report a 37-year-old African-American man with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) diagnosed in May 2001 when he presented with biopsy-proven nephritis. He had been treated intermittently from May 2001 to November 2004 with intravenously (i.v.) administered cyclophosphamide and high doses of prednisone due to unrelenting proteinuria. In November 2004, he was admitted to the hospital because of deterioration of renal function and massive proteinuria (21 g dl(-1) 24 h(-1)) and treated with pulses of methylprednisolone and two courses of i.v. administered cyclophosphamide. His hospital course was complicated by cellulitis and bacteremia with Pseudomonas spp. and Streptococcus bovis. He was discharged on prednisone 60 mg daily, ciprofloxacin, augmentin, and hemodialysis. He was readmitted a week later with new onset of seizure activity, slurred speech, and left-sided hemiparesis. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed multiple ringlike enhancing foci in the frontal and occipital lobes. Brain biopsy was performed, and Gram stain and initial cultures were negative. Empiric tobramycin, cefepime, and metronidazole were administered. Diagnosis was delayed for several months, but culture eventually grew Nocardia asteroides. Trimethoprim-sulfomethoxazole and linezolid therapy was begun. This was followed by slow, but steady, clinical improvement. Risk factors, diagnostic clues, and treatment are reviewed.
TI  - Changes in equine hindgut bacterial populations during oligofructose-induced laminitis.
AB  - In the horse, carbohydrate overload is thought to play an integral role in the onset of laminitis by drastically altering the profile of bacterial populations in the hindgut. The objectives of this study were to develop and validate microbial ecology methods to monitor changes in bacterial populations throughout the course of experimentally induced laminitis and to identify the predominant oligofructose-utilizing organisms. Laminitis was induced in five horses by administration of oligofructose. Faecal specimens were collected at 8 h intervals from 72 h before to 72 h after the administration of oligofructose. Hindgut microbiota able to utilize oligofructose were enumerated throughout the course of the experiment using habitat-simulating medium. Isolates were collected and representatives identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The majority of these isolates collected belonged to the genus Streptococcus, 91% of which were identified as being most closely related to Streptococcus infantarius ssp. coli. Furthermore, S. infantarius ssp. coli was the predominant oligofructose-utilizing organism isolated before the onset of lameness. Fluorescence in situ hybridization probes developed to specifically target the isolated Streptococcus spp. demonstrated marked population increases between 8 and 16 h post oligofructose administration. This was followed by a rapid population decline which corresponded with a sharp decline in faecal pH and subsequently lameness at 24-32 h post oligofructose administration. This research suggests that streptococci within the Streptococcus bovis/equinus complex may be involved in the series of events which precede the onset of laminitis in the horse.
TI  - Artisanal and experimental Pecorino Siciliano cheese: microbial dynamics during manufacture assessed by culturing and PCR-DGGE analyses.
AB  - Traditional artisanal Pecorino Siciliano (PS) cheeses, and two experimental PS cheeses were manufactured using either raw or pasteurised ewes' milk with the addition of starter cultures. The bacterial diversity and dynamics of the different cheese types were evaluated both by culturing and characterisation of isolates, and a culture-independent approach based on the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. Following cultivation, artisanal and experimental cheese types showed similar microbial counts, and isolates belonging to Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides were identified by phenotypic characterisation and comparison of the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the 16S rRNA gene to that of reference species. The culture-independent fingerprinting technique PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of V6 to V8 regions of the 16S rRNA gene of samples taken during artisanal PS cheese manufacture, from raw milk to the ripened cheese, indicated relevant shifts in the microbial community structure. The dominance of Streptococcus bovis and Lactococcus lactis species in the traditional artisanal PS was revealed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Comparison of DGGE profiles of samples from milk to ripened cheese, derived from artisanal procedure and the two experimental PS cheeses during production showed similar trends with the presence of intense bands in common. Nevertheless, the profiles of several artisanal cheeses from different farms appeared more diverse, and these additional species are probably responsible for the generally superior flavour and aroma development of traditional PS cheese.
TI  - The association of Streptococcus bovis bacteremia and gastrointestinal diseases:  a retrospective analysis.
AB  - There is a well-established association between Streptococcus bovis bacteremia (SBB) and colorectal cancer. However, SBB is also frequently associated with chronic liver disease and has been described with other gastrointestinal disorders. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of gastrointestinal disease in patients with SBB. Retrospective analysis of the microbiology database at Jackson Memorial Medical Center, Miami, Florida, between 1992 and 2002, was performed. Patients' clinical records were reviewed, with special focus on underlying gastrointestinal disease or other major comorbidities. Thirty-eight patients (83%) were adults and eight (17%) were pediatric patients. Nineteen patients presented with gastrointestinal disorders associated with SBB (41%). Nine adult patients (19%) had end-stage liver disease (five female). Six patients had alcohol-induced liver disease (one with concomitant chronic hepatitis C), with the remaining three cases related to autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Colonic neoplasms (adenocarcinoma in 3 and adenomatous polyps in 3) were found in 6 of 10 adult patients in whom colonoscopic evaluation was performed. Seven adult patients had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (18%). Mortality in the patients with AIDS and SBB was high (71%). No significant association with gastrointestinal diseases was found in the pediatric population. Bacteremia due to S. bovis in adults is frequently associated with hepatic dysfunction (1:4), colonic neoplasms (1:6), and AIDS (1:6). This association was valid for our adult population only. SBB is an early clue to the likely presence of these serious underlying conditions and warrants rigorous investigation when recognized.
TI  - Assessment of biases associated with profiling simple, model communities using terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism-based analyses.
AB  - Community profiles based on terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analyses of amplified ribosomal RNA genes are used to monitor changes in microbial community structure and are sometimes employed for semi-quantitative estimates of species richness and abundance in environmental samples. To assess the accuracy of T-RFLP community profiles representing the relative abundance of bacteria in a sample, five species of ruminal bacteria were used to construct simple "communities". Template DNA for PCR amplification was generated either by mixing equal quantities of genomic DNA from pure cultures or by mixing equal numbers of cells prior to DNA extraction. Pairwise mixtures of Fibrobacter succinogenes S85 with Ruminococcus albus 8, Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49 and Streptococcus bovis JB1 were created and a 5-member community was constructed. With genomic DNA mixes, relative abundance calculations based on T-RFLP patterns did not reflect input ratios. These discrepancies could not be accounted for by differences in genome size and rRNA operon copy number. In cell mixing experiments, easily lysed cells were overrepresented. To determine if a numerical correction factor could be used to compensate for observed discrepancies, we attempted to quantify biases attributed to DNA extraction and PCR amplification. Biases attributable to these factors led to deviations from expected PCR product ratios by 6% to 38%. We found that interactions were so complex that a suitable factor could not be derived. The unsystematic dependence of T-RFLP peak ratios on variability of DNA extraction and PCR amplification prevents accurate quantification of the relative abundance of microorganisms designed to represent simplified natural populations.
TI  - Presence of NAD+-specific glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and CcpA-dependent transcription of its gene in the ruminal bacterium Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - To know the role of NADP+-specific glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPN) in Streptococcus bovis, the molecular properties and transcriptional control of the gene encoding GAPN (gapN) were examined. The GAPN in S. bovis was deduced to consist of 476 amino acids with a molecular mass of 51.1 kDa. The gapN gene was transcribed in a monocistronic fashion. GAPN synthesis appeared to be regulated at the transcriptional level in response to changes in growth conditions. In a mutant that lacks the ccpA gene encoding catabolite control protein A (CcpA), the gapN-mRNA level was lower than in the parent strain. A binding site of CcpA was found in the upper region of gapN. These results suggest that transcription of gapN is regulated through CcpA. Overexpression of GAPN in S. bovis did not affect the growth rate or formate-to-lactate ratio, suggesting that the flux in the glycolytic pathway is unlikely to be altered by GAPN activity. Streptococcus bovis GAPN was NADP+ dependent, but not phosphate dependent. In addition, S. bovis did not have other NADPH-producing systems such as the hexose monophosphate pathway and NADPH:NAD+ oxidoreductase. Therefore, GAPN may play an important role in NADPH production in S. bovis.
TI  - Septic discitis as initial manifestation of streptococcus bovis endocarditis.
AB  - A 68-year-old man with septic discitis of low lumbar spine is presented. The patient suffered an acute hemorrhagic stroke due to rupture of mycotic aneurysm. Streptococcus bovis biotype I was found in blood cultures. Echocardiography showed bioprosthesis aortic endocarditis. Cardiac surgery was not performed because of normal bioprosthesis function and absence of peri-annular complications. The patient was discharged after 6 weeks of antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Production of L-lactic acid from fresh cassava roots slurried with tofu liquid waste by Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - To reduce the production cost of biodegradable plastics, the fermentation performance of L-lactic acid for a new fermentation medium, fresh cassava roots (FCRs) as a substrate slurried with tofu liquid waste (TLW) as basal medium, was investigated by batch fermentation of Streptococcus bovis. The fermentation properties of the three substrates, namely, FCR, tapioca (cassava starch) and glucose, which were independently mixed with TLW, were compared with those independently mixed with the standard basal medium, trypto-soya broth (TSB). Experiments were conducted at various sugar concentrations of the substrates with CaCO(3) as a neutralizer. The maximum L-lactic acid concentrations (C(La)) obtained using the three substrates in TLW were about 75% of those obtained using TSB caused by less nutrients in the TLW. The L-lactic acid productivities (P(La)) and the specific growth rates of S. bovis (mu) in TLW were about 1/4 to 1/3 and 1/5 to 1/4 of those in TSB, respectively. The maximum C(La), P(La) and mu were obtained at 10% w/w sugar concentration. Total yields (eta) were nearly constant up to 10% w/w sugar concentration for TSB and TLW, that is, 80% to 85% and 50% to 60%, respectively. But their total yields decreased in more than 10% w/w sugar concentration in both basal media, because of substrate inhibition. The fermentation properties (C(La), P(La), mu, and eta) were found to be in the order of: FCR > tapioca > glucose for all concentrations of the three substrates. The fermentation properties for FCR and tapioca were higher than those for glucose, in TLW or TSB, because S. bovis in a medium containing starch (FCR and tapioca) has more amylase activity than in a medium containing glucose. The nutrients in FCR with poor nutrient basal medium (TLW) more strongly affected the fermentation properties than those in FCR with rich nutrient basal medium (TSB). The proposed fermentation medium of FCR slurried with TLW is worth studying in order to reduce production cost of biodegradable plastics.
TI  - Epidemiologic, clinical, and microbiologic profile of infective endocarditis in Argentina: a national survey. The Endocarditis Infecciosa en la Republica Argentina-2 (EIRA-2) Study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine the epidemiologic, clinical, microbiologic characteristics, and inhospital outcome of infective endocarditis (IE) in Argentina and compare the results with those of the 1992 IE national survey. METHODS: A prospective, multicenter study was conducted in 82 hospitals representing 16 of 24 provinces of Argentina. Patients with diagnosis of IE according to the Duke criteria were surveyed during an 18-month period. RESULTS: From 470 surveyed episodes of IE, 390 cases were classified as definite and 80 as possible IE. The mean age of the definite IE cases was 58.5 +/- 17.3 years; male sex, 70.0%; and male-female ratio, 2.3:1. Pathological evidence of IE was available in 26.2%. There was no previously known heart disease in 35.1%, and the proportion of prosthetic valve IE was 15.9%. Causative microorganisms were streptococci, 38.3% (Streptococcus viridans 27.0%, Streptococcus bovis 5.2%, others 6.1%); enterococci, 10.2%; staphylococci, 36.7% (Staphylococcus aureus 29.8%, coagulase-negative staphylococci 6.9%); HACEK group, 6.1%; fungal, 1.4%; and polymicrobial, 2.0%. Blood culture results were negative in 10.8%. Surgical treatment was performed in 26.2%, and the overall inhospital mortality was 24.6%. Patients from the 2002 survey were older (58.5 +/- 17.3 vs 51.3 +/- 18.7 years, P < .01) and more frequently had underlying heart disease (64.9% vs 55.0%, P < .01): degenerative valve disease (11.5% vs 4.8%, P < .01), congenital heart disease (9.5% vs 4.2%, P < .01), and prosthetic valve IE (15.9% vs 8.5%, P < .01). Conversely, the prevalence of rheumatic valve disease was significantly less than in the 1992 survey (5.4% vs 13.0%, P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: The EIRA-2 survey shows that the clinical profile of IE has changed in Argentina. Currently, patients with IE are older and have a higher frequency of underlying heart disease, degenerative valve disease, and prosthetic valve IE than previously. The incidence of staphylococcal IE has increased. Inhospital mortality remains high, suggesting that more aggressive measures are needed for the early identification, prevention, and treatment of IE.
TI  - Factors affecting the activity of bovicin HC5, a bacteriocin from Streptococcus bovis HC5: release, stability and binding to target bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the factors affecting the release, stability and binding of bovicin HC5 to sensitive bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Stationary phase Streptococcus bovis HC5 cultures had little cell-free bovicin HC5 activity until the final pH was <5.0, and even more bacteriocin was released by treatment with acidic NaCl (pH 2.0, 100 mmol l(-1)). Cultures grown with Tween 80 had more cell-free bovicin HC5 than untreated controls, but this nonionic detergent enhanced activity rather than release. Bovicin HC5 binding to S. bovis JB1 (a susceptible strain) was greater at pH values <6.0. Bovicin HC5 bound other sensitive Gram-positive bacteria, but not Gram-negative species. Cultures retained most of their activity for 35 days, but only if the final pH was <5.6. If the final pH was >5.6, peptidases destroyed much of the activity. CONCLUSIONS: Bovicin HC5 remains cell associated until the culture pH is <5.0, but it can be easily dissociated from the cell surface by acidic NaCl. It is highly stable in acidic environments and only binds sensitive bacteria at pH values <6.0. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Streptococcus bovis HC5 does not have generally regarded as safe status. However, bovicin HC5 has a broad spectrum of activity and sensitive bacteria do not become resistant. Based on these results, bovicin HC5 may be a useful bacteriocin model.
TI  - Display of alpha-amylase on the surface of Lactobacillus casei cells by use of the PgsA anchor protein, and production of lactic acid from starch.
AB  - We developed a new cell surface engineering system based on the PgsA anchor protein from Bacillus subtilis. In this system, the N terminus of the target protein was fused to the PgsA protein and the resulting fusion protein was expressed on the cell surface. Using this new system, we constructed a novel starch-degrading strain of Lactobacillus casei by genetically displaying alpha-amylase from the Streptococcus bovis strain 148 with a FLAG peptide tag (AmyAF). Localization of the PgsA-AmyA-FLAG fusion protein on the cell surface was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometric analysis. The lactic acid bacteria which displayed AmyAF showed significantly elevated hydrolytic activity toward soluble starch. By fermentation using AmyAF-displaying L. casei cells, 50 g/liter of soluble starch was reduced to 13.7 g/liter, and 21.8 g/liter of lactic acid was produced within about 24 h. The yield in terms of grams of lactic acid produced per gram of carbohydrate utilized was 0.60 g per g of carbohydrate consumed at 24 h. Since AmyA was immobilized on the cells, cells were recovered after fermentation and used repeatedly. During repeated utilization of cells, the lactic acid yield was improved to 0.81 g per g of carbohydrate consumed at 72 h. These results indicate that efficient simultaneous saccharification and fermentation from soluble starch to lactic acid were carried out by recombinant L. casei cells with cell surface display of AmyA.
TI  - Extracellular metabolomics: a metabolic footprinting approach to assess fiber degradation in complex media.
AB  - This work reports the implementation and optimization of a method for high-throughput analysis of metabolites produced by the breakdown of natural polysaccharides by microorganisms. Our simple protocol enables simultaneous separation and quantification of more than 40 different sugars and sugar derivatives, in addition to several organic acids in complex media, using 50-mul samples and a standard gas chromatography-mass spectrometry platform that was fully optimized for this purpose. As an implementation proof-of-concept, we assayed extracellular metabolite levels of three bacterial strains cultivated on complex medium rich in polysaccharides and under identical growth conditions. We demonstrate that the metabolic footprinting profile data distinguish among sample types such as typical metabolomics data. Moreover, we demonstrate that the differential metabolite-level data provide insight on specific fibrolytic activity of the different microbial strains and lay the groundwork for integrated proteome-metabolome studies of fiber-degrading microorganisms.
TI  - Abomasal bacteria produce an inhibitor of gastrin secretion in vitro.
AB  - Previously, proliferating microflora transferred with abomasal nematodes, were suspected to be the source of the gastrin inhibitor in some parasite excretory/secretory products. Aerobic cultures in HBSS of abomasal fluid from uninfected sheep became inhibitory during the static growth phase, unless antibiotics were present. Basal gastrin secretion was reduced by up to 90%. Rumen fluid and incubates and medium in which Streptococcus bovis and ovine rumen Actinomycete spp. had been grown also contained the inhibitor. Unlike abomasal cultures, rumen fluid and incubates also reduced the measurement of gastrin standards. Rumen incubates were less potent after exposure to pH 2-3, suggesting that inactivation normally occurs in the unparasitised abomasum. Contaminating bacteria which generate the gastrin inhibitor in parasite ES products are probably rumen organisms which survive in the abomasum and proliferate during subsequent incubation. Significantly, rumen bacteria have been shown to be capable of affecting the secretory activity of the gastric mucosa.
TI  - Ability of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 to participate in bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelial barrier.
AB  - Although hundreds of microbial species reside in the human intestinal tract, comparatively few (e.g., Escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, Enterococcus faecalis, etc.) are typically associated with systemic infection in postsurgical, shock, and trauma patients. Syndecan-1 is the predominant cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on epithelia, and there is substantial evidence that heparan sulfate participates in interactions of a variety of frankly pathogenic microbes with mammalian cells. To investigate the role of syndecan-1 in interactions of enteric flora with intestinal epithelium, bacteria that might use the enterocyte as a portal of entry for systemic infection (including E. faecalis, E. coli, and other enterobacteria, and several species of staphylococci and streptococci) were studied for their abilities to interact with syndecan-1. Streptococcus bovis, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis showed increased adherence to ARH-77 cells transfected to express syndecan-1. Heparin, a heparan sulfate analog, inhibited internalization of S. bovis, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, and S. aureus by HT-29 enterocytes (prominent syndecan-1 expression), but not Caco-2 enterocytes (relatively low syndecan-1 expression). Data from experiments with Chinese hamster ovary cells with altered glycosaminoglycan expression indicated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (glycosaminoglycans on the syndecan-1 ectodomain) participated in bacterial interactions with mammalian cells. Thus, although E. faecalis, E. coli, and other gram-negative enterobacteria did not appear to interact with syndecan-1, this heparan sulfate proteoglycan may mediate enterocyte interactions with some staphylococci and streptococci that are known to cause systemic infections in specific populations of high-risk, immunosuppressed, postsurgical, and trauma patients.
TI  - [Update on infectious endocarditis].
AB  - Although one of the oldest known cardiac disease, infectious endocarditis (IE) remains a subject of constant change from epidemiological, diagnostic and therapeutic points of view. In the epidemiological field, the main feature is the increasing incidence of IE due to streptococcus bovis. Representing a quarter of cases in France, this type of IE is particularly frequent in the elderly and underlying colonic disease should be investigated. In the diagnostic field, the progress of methods of microbiological identification has been considerable, especially in molecular (PCR) and histological diagnosis which are particularly useful in IE with negative blood cultures. From the prognostic point of view, the role of echocardiography has recently been emphasised not only for diagnosis but also for prognosis and for predicting the embolic risk. The longest vegetations (>10 or 15 mm) are associated with a greater risk not only of embolism but also in terms of prognosis. The recent recommendations of the French Society of Cardiology recall the main surgical indications in IE and include a new indication of echocardiography.
TI  - Observations on salpingitis, peritonitis and salpingoperitonitis in a layer breeder flock.
AB  - A flock of 13,951 hens and 1379 cockerels was monitored from 26 to 58 weeks of age for the complex of salpingitis, peritonitis and salpingoperitonitis (sps). Two hundred and forty-three hens (78 per cent of the hens that died) were examined postmortem, and sps was recognised by gross examination for inflammatory exudate, in the body cavity or oviduct in 111 (46 per cent) of them. Salpingoperitonitis was the most common form, followed by salpingitis and then peritonitis. There were acute and chronic cases in all three conditions, but only in peritonitis were acute cases more common than chronic cases. Seventeen birds that had died of sps were cultured for aerobic bacteria within 12 hours of death. Escherichia coli was recovered from a variety of tissues from all of them, and other bacteria, including staphylococci, Mannheimia haemolytica and Streptococcus bovis, were isolated from a few carcases, either alone or together with E coli. Relatively few isolations of E coli were made from normal hens cultured 48, 72 and 96 hours after death.
TI  - Efficient production of L-(+)-lactic acid from raw starch by Streptococcus bovis  148.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis 148 was found to produce L-(+)-lactic acid directly from soluble and raw starch substrates at pH 6.0. Productivity was highest at 37 degrees C, with 14.7 g/l lactic acid produced from 20 g/l raw starch. The yield and optical purity of L-lactic acid were 0.88 and 95.6%, respectively.
TI  - The erm(T) gene is flanked by IS1216V in inducible erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus.
AB  - We investigated the sequence and the genetic context of the erm(T) gene in six inducible erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (formerly S. bovis biotype II.2) isolates. In all isolates, the erm(T) genes were flanked by two IS1216V-like elements with the same polarity and were found to be inserted in the chromosome.
TI  - Cerebral ischemia caused by Streptococcus bovis aortic endocarditis: case report.
AB  - Cerebral ischemic processes associated with infective endocarditis caused by Streptococcus bovis are rare; only 2 cases having been reported. Here we report a case of a 50-year-old man with S. bovis endocarditis who presented signs of frontal, parietal and occipital lobe cerebral ischemia. This is the first case reported in which the presence of hemianopsia preceded the endocarditis diagnosis. Initially, the clinical manifestations suggested a systemic vasculitis. Later, vegetating lesions were identified in the aortic valve and S. bovis grew in blood cultures. Antibiotic use and aortic valve replacement eliminated the infection and ceased thromboembolic events. A video colonoscopy examination revealed no mucosal lesions as a portal of entry in this case, although such lesions have been encountered in up to 70% of reported cases of S. bovis endocarditis.
TI  - Characterization of culturable anaerobic bacteria from the forestomach of an eastern grey kangaroo, Macropus giganteus.
AB  - AIM: To determine the culturable biodiversity of anaerobic bacteria isolated from the forestomach contents of an eastern grey kangaroo, Macropus giganteus, using phenotypic characterization and 16S rDNA sequence analysis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bacteria from forestomach contents of an eastern grey kangaroo were isolated using anaerobic media containing milled curly Mitchell grass (Astrebla lappacea). DNA was extracted and the 16S rDNA sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. Forty bacterial isolates were obtained and placed in 17 groups based on phenotypic characteristics and restriction enzyme digestion of 16S rDNA PCR products. DNA sequencing revealed that the 17 groups comprised five known species (Clostridium butyricum, Streptococcus bovis, Clostridium sporogenes, Clostridium paraputrificum and Enterococcus avium) and 12 groups apparently representing new species, all within the phylum Firmicutes. CONCLUSIONS: Foregut contents from Australian macropod marsupials contain a microbial ecosystem with a novel bacterial biodiversity comprising a high percentage of previously unrecognized species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study adds to knowledge of Australia's unique biodiversity, which may provide a future bioresource of genetic information and bacterial species of benefit to agriculture.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology of Streptococcus bovis causing endocarditis and bacteraemia in Italian patients.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis is being recognised increasingly as a cause of infective endocarditis, and has also been associated with underlying gastrointestinal malignancy. This study evaluated the molecular epidemiology of S. bovis isolates responsible for endocarditis or bacteraemia in Italian patients between January 1990 and August 2003. S. bovis isolates were classified on the basis of their biochemical profiles, antimicrobial susceptibilities and genotypes. Of 25 isolates studied, 20 were S. bovis I and five were S. bovis II. Seven biochemical profiles were identified. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis identified 22 profiles that differed by at least two DNA fragments and showed a similarity of < 87%. Most PFGE patterns represented single isolates that differed in antimicrobial susceptibility, but three PFGE types were observed, with identical profiles and antibiotypes, in isolates from two different patients. S. bovis I and II isolates grouped into two distinct genetic clusters (I and II) with a similarity coefficient of 38%. Two sub-clusters (Ia and Ib), with a similarity coefficient of 47%, included 17 S. bovis I isolates with similar biochemical profiles (15 with biotype A, and two with biotype B), but different resistance phenotypes. Based on the phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity of the isolates, it is postulated that the increase in S. bovis endocarditis in this geographical area might have been caused by the selection of sporadic endemic clones from the endogenous intestinal flora.
TI  - [Study on treatment strategy for ventriculitis associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the treatment strategy for ventriculitis associated with ventriculo peritoneal shunt for hydrocephalus. METHODS: For all of the patients suspected to have cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infections, the first step of treatment was removal of the "infected" shunts, then a ventricular drainage was placed in frontal horn of the ventricle, and at the same time CSF was obtained from the ventricle for bacterial culture and tests of bacterial sensitivities to antibiotics. After the shunt removal and before the result from bacterial cultures was obtained, 25-50 mg of vancomycin was administered intraventricularly daily. As soon as the result from bacterial cultures was obtained, antibiotics should be adjusted according to the sensitivity test result. By the time of the infections being controlled, appropriate treatments including reshunting would finally be given for hydrocephalus if necessary. RESULTS: Among 11 patients, 9 were infected with coagulase-negative Staphylococci or Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus, one of them with concomitant infection of aerobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacteriaceae aerogenesis, 1 patient with Streptococci, and another one with Mycobacterium stercoris bovis. The tests of drug sensitivity showed that cocci in infection of 9 patients were all sensitive to vancomycin, but only 1 of them sensitive to gentamycin. There were other sensitive antibiotics for streptococcus in 1 case and for bacillus in 2 patients. Practically vancomycin was effective for 8 of 11 patients, including one case of streptococcal infection. The duration for anti-infection treatment was in a range of 16-36 days. Finally, all of 11 patients survived from the shunt ventriculitis, and 9 of them had significant improvement in their neurological functions. CONCLUSION: (1)Intraventricular administration of proper antibiotics is a reliable and effective way to treat ventriculitis associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunts. (2)Vancomycin is the preferred antibiotic for ventriculitis, but other kind(s) of some antibiotics are necessary in a few patients in addition to or instead of vancomycin. (3)The effect of systemic use of antibiotics could not be defined in this series of patients, but this may be used as an adjunct in the practice. (4)There are many problems related to diagnosis and treatment of shunt ventriculitis that should be studied more extensively and deeply.

TI  - Display of active enzymes on the cell surface of Escherichia coli using PgsA anchor protein and their application to bioconversion.
AB  - We have developed a novel Escherichia coli cell surface display system by employing PgsA as an anchoring motif. In our display system, C-terminal fusion to PgsA anchor protein from Bacillus subtilis was used. The enzymes selected for display were alpha-amylase (AmyA) from Streptococcus bovis 148 and lipase B (CALB) from Candida antarctica. The molecular mass values of AmyA and CALB are approximately 77 and 34 kDa, respectively. The enzymes were displayed on the surface as a fusion protein with a FLAG peptide tag at the C terminus. Both the PgsA-AmyA-FLAG and PgsA-CALB-FLAG fusion proteins were shown to be displayed by immunofluorescence labeling using anti-FLAG antibody. The displayed enzymes were active forms, and AmyA and CALB activities reached 990 U/g (dry cell weight) and 4.6 U/g (dry cell weight), respectively. AmyA-displaying E. coli cells grew utilizing cornstarch as the sole carbon source, while CALB-displaying E. coli cells catalyzed enantioselective transesterification, indicating that they are effective whole-cell biocatalysts. Since a target enzyme with a size of 77 kDa and an industrially useful lipase have been successfully displayed on the cell surface of E. coli for the first time, PgsA protein is probably a useful anchoring motif to display various enzymes.
TI  - Viridans group streptococci: an underestimated cause of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients with ascites.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to examine the characteristics of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) caused by streptococci, in particular viridans group streptococci (VGS), and to investigate a potential association between the long-term administration of norfloxacin and high-level resistance to fluoroquinolones in these organisms. METHODS: We reviewed 84 episodes of SBP and bacterascites caused by streptococci that occurred in 75 patients over a 6-year period. Isolates were tested for antibiotic susceptibility by the determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations. RESULTS: Of the 84 isolates, 46 (54.8%) were associated with SBP, 12 (14.3%) were associated with symptomatic bacterascites, and 26 (31%) were associated with asymptomatic bacterascites. VGS were responsible for 39 of the 58 episodes of SBP and symptomatic bacterascites, largely preceding group B streptococci (n=7), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=6) and Streptococcus bovis (n=5). Most of the episodes were community acquired. An extraperitoneal site of infection was found in three patients only. Positive blood cultures were less frequent in patients with VGS infection than in those with SBP caused by other streptococci (12.8 versus 52.6%, P<0.001). The rates of susceptibility to penicillin, amoxicillin and cefotaxime were 84.5, 87.9 and 91.4%, respectively. All isolates, including those from patients receiving norfloxacin, were susceptible to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: VGS are an underestimated cause of SBP in patients with cirrhosis. Most isolates are susceptible to beta-lactam agents and new fluoroquinolones.
TI  - Active infectious endocarditis: postoperative outcome.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Many changes have occurred in the natural history and the management of active infectious endocarditis (AIE) in recent years. Therefore, the records of patients admitted in a tertiary care specialized hospital presenting with the Duke criteria were reviewed. METHODS: Adults operated on to treat AIE were included during a 3-year period. Patients presenting with AIE associated with a pacemaker were not included. Bacteriologic investigations included blood cultures, intraoperative samplings (including polymerase chain reaction), and serologies. Clinical and bacteriologic factors associated with hospital mortality were studied by univariate regression analysis (p < 0.05). RESULTS: Ninety-eight of 164 patients (60%) admitted with the diagnosis of AIE underwent valvular surgery. The duration between the beginning of AIE and surgery was 23 +/- 16 (mean +/- standard deviation) days. Only 45 patients had a previous history of valvular disease. Seventy-two patients presented with aortic and 41 with mitral valve AIE. Fifty suffered from embolic events. Streptococcus species were responsible in 64 cases (23 were Streptococcus bovis) and Staphylococcus species in 24 cases. Death occurred postoperatively in 19 patients. The factors associated with fatal outcome were preoperative hemodynamic instability, age, Parsonnet and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II scores, diabetes mellitus, preexisting valvulopathy, antiarrhythmic treatment, hypoalbuminemia, renal dysfunction, duration of extracorporeal circulation, and red cell allogeneic transfusions. The type of bacteria did not influence mortality. The mean intensive care unit and hospital stays were 10 and 39 days, respectively. Eleven patients suffered from neurologic sequelae; 2 years later, 2 of them presented with severe deficit and 1 had died. CONCLUSIONS: AIE necessitating cardiac surgery should be considered as a severe and resource-consuming disease.
TI  - Gross abnormalities, bacteriology and histological lesions of uteri of dairy cows failing to conceive or maintain pregnancy.
AB  - AIM: To describe the gross pathology, bacteriology and histopathology of the reproductive tracts of dairy cows that failed to conceive or maintain pregnancy. METHODS: The reproductive tracts of 105 cows that were not pregnant at the end of the seasonal breeding programme were retrieved following slaughter. The tracts were examined grossly, both horns of the uterine lumen were swabbed for bacteriology, and tissue was collected from each horn and the body of the uterus for histopathology. Grossly enlarged uteri and tracts containing purulent vaginal content were excluded. Histopathology was performed on three sections of uterine tissue from each of three cows in which no gross pathological changes were detected and from which no bacteria were isolated, from three cows in which no gross pathology was detected but from which bacteria were isolated, and from three cows in which gross pathological changes were detected but from which no bacteria were isolated. RESULTS: Thirty-six (34%) cows had one or more gross lesions which involved the ovary, uterine tube, uterus or vagina. Bacteria were isolated from the uteri of 22 (21%) cows. Isolates included Arcanobacterium pyogenes (n = 1), Escherichia coli (n = 1), Fusobacterium spp (n = 1), Haemophilus somnus (n = 5), Streptococcus acidominimus (n = 12), S. bovis (n = 2), S. uberis (n = 1) and S. salivarious (n = 1). In only five cows were both gross pathology and bacteria detected. There was no relationship between the isolation of bacteria and the diagnosis of gross pathology of the uterus. There were no differences in the degree of histopathological changes in the uteri from the three groups of cows examined, and lesions present were minor. CONCLUSIONS: Gross pathological changes and intra-uterine bacteria were found in 34% and 20% of cows, respectively, but the correlation between the two was poor. Histopathological changes were unremarkable, suggesting the bacteriological findings were coincidental, that causative agents of infertility were not present at the time of examination, or that unrelated causes such as nutritional anoestrus may have been responsible for the failure of some cows to conceive.
TI  - [Accidental fall and word finding problems in heart valve disease].
AB  - Abscesses of the spleen are rare and, if untreated, lead to death. The usual mode of development is by hematogenous spread of infection. Treatment options are splenectomy, percutaneous drainage and in selected cases an antibiotic therapy. We report a case of a splenic abscess due to Streptococcus bovis treated with antibiotics only.
TI  - Risk of embolism and death in infective endocarditis: prognostic value of echocardiography: a prospective multicenter study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of embolic events (EE) and death is still high in patients with infective endocarditis (IE), and data about predictors of these 2 major complications are conflicting. Moreover, the exact role of echocardiography in risk stratification is not well defined. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a multicenter prospective European study, including 384 consecutive patients (aged 57+/-17 years) with definite IE according to Duke University criteria, we tested clinical, microbiological, and echocardiographic data as potential predictors of EE and 1-year mortality. Transesophageal echocardiography was performed in all patients. Embolism occurred before or after IE diagnosis (total-EE) in 131 patients (34.1%) and after initiation of antibiotic therapy (new-EE) in 28 patients (7.3%). Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus bovis were independently associated with total-EE, whereas vegetation length >10 mm and severe vegetation mobility were predictors of new-EE, even after adjustment for S aureus and S bovis. One-year mortality was 20.6%. In multivariable analysis, independently of the other predictors of death (age, female sex, creatinine serum >2 mg/L, moderate or severe congestive heart failure, and S aureus) and comorbidity, vegetation length >15 mm was a predictor of 1-year mortality (adjusted relative risk=1.8; 95% CI, 1.10 to 2.82; P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In IE, vegetation length is a strong predictor of new-EE and mortality. In combination with clinical and microbiological findings, echocardiography may identify high-risk patients who will need a more aggressive therapeutic strategy.
TI  - Molecular monitoring and characterization of the faecal microbiota of healthy dogs during fructan supplementation.
AB  - The large intestine of dogs contains a complex microbial ecosystem with predominance of streptococci, bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, Bacteroides and Clostridium. Generally, this predominant microbiota in dogs is relatively stable in time but much less is known about its taxonomic composition. Moreover, almost no studies have been conducted to investigate this stability of the faecal microbial population in dogs upon prebiotic administration. The objective of the present study was to monitor possible changes in faecal microbiota of seven healthy adult dogs related to the administration of two fructans, oligofructose and inulin. For this purpose, population fingerprints generated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of universal V3 16 S rRNA gene PCR amplicons were compared between control (baseline) samples and samples collected after prebiotic feeding. From these DGGE gels, marked changes were observed in the faecal microbiota between subjects and before and after fructan administration. One DGGE band that appeared or intensified after fructan intake was further analyzed. Sequence analysis could attribute this band to a member of the Streptococcus bovis-equinus group. Following cultivation on MRS medium, a set of faecal isolates that most likely represent the stimulated streptococci were allocated to the species Streptococcus lutetiensis by (GTG)(5)-PCR fingerprinting and partial 16 S rRNA and sodA gene sequencing. The data provided in this study demonstrate the ability of fructans to influence the bacterial composition of the gut microbiota in healthy dogs. More work is needed to unravel the relevance of S. lutetiensis or other autochthonous organisms of the dog gut as target groups for prebiotic supplementation.
TI  - Binding of porcine ficolin-alpha to lipopolysaccharides from Gram-negative bacteria and lipoteichoic acids from Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Protein(s) reactive with N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) was isolated from porcine nonimmune serum. The molecular weight of the purified protein was found to be mainly 40 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. The N-terminal 10 amino acid sequence of the purified protein were found to be identical to that of porcine ficolin-alpha reported previously. In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the purified protein was found to react with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from different Gram-negative bacteria such as Esherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella abortus equi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella flexeneri, and Serratia marcescens and with lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus sanguis, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. The purified protein also reacted with E. coli O26 isolated from food poisoning and bovine feces and heat-treated Gram-positive bacteria such as S. aureus, B. cereus, B. subtilis, Enterococcus faecium, and Corynebacterum bovis. On the other hand, porcine IgG isolated from nonimmune serum showed different reactivity with these LPS, LTA, and heat-treated bacterial cells. From the present findings, purified porcine serum protein reactive with GlcNAc is concluded to be ficolin-alpha playing an important role(s) in innate immunity against microbial infection with Gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
TI  - Molecular study on cloned endoglucanase gene from rumen bacterium.
AB  - An endoglucanase gene was subcloned from anaerobic rumen bacterium Ruminococcus flavefaciens strain 17. To express endoglucanase gene in Escherichia coli and Streptococcus bovis JB1, an endoglucanase gene fragment was inserted into pVA838-based shuttle vectors. Removal of endoglucanase gene promoter and expression of endoglucanase by promoter of S. bovis JB1 alpha-amylase gene (pACMCS) was also achieved. Survival of constructs pVACMCI, pTACMC and pACMCS, which carry endoglucanase gene, and stability of endoglucanase gene in S. bovis JB1, were observed. Maximal endoglucanase activities from S. bovis JB1/pVACMCI were 2- to 3-fold higher than from E. coli/pVACMCI. Specific cell activity of E. coli/pACMCS was found to be approximately 2- to -3 fold higher than the both E. coli/pVACMCI and E. coli/pTACMC. Specific cell activity of S. bovis JB1/pACMCS was also found to be approximately 2-fold higher than the both S. bovis/pVACMCI and S. bovis JB1/pTACMC.
TI  - HIV infection associated with Strongyloides stercoralis colitis resulting in Streptococcus bovis bacteraemia and meningitis.
AB  - We report the case of an HIV infected patient with Streptococcus bovis bacteraemia and meningitis associated with gastrointestinal Strongyloides stercoralis infection. To our knowledge, this has been reported once previously and serves as a reminder to actively exclude asymptomatic S stercoralis infection in HIV infected individuals presenting with bacteraemia.
TI  - Clinical characteristics and significance of Streptococcus salivarius bacteremia  and Streptococcus bovis bacteremia: a prospective 16-year study.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the clinical significance of Streptococcus salivarius isolates recovered from blood cultures and compare them with isolates of Streptococcus bovis biotypes I and II. Seventeen of the 52 (32%) S. salivarius isolates recovered were considered clinically significant, compared with 62 of the 64 (97%) S. bovis isolates (p<0.0001). Bacteremia caused by S. salivarius occurred mostly in patients who showed relevant disruption of the mucous membranes and/or serious underlying diseases. Patients with S. salivarius bacteremia were younger than those with S. bovis bacteremia (57 vs. 67 years; p<0.01). Patients with S. salivarius bacteremia and patients with S. bovis II bacteremia had similar rates of endocarditis, colon tumors, and non-colon cancer. On the other hand, when compared with S. bovis I bacteremia, S. salivarius bacteremia was associated with lower rates of endocarditis (18% vs. 74%, respectively) (p<0.01) and colon tumors (0% vs. 57%, respectively) (p<0.005) and higher rates of non-colon cancer (53% vs. 9.5%, respectively) (p<0.01). Bacteremia caused by S. bovis II had a hepatobiliary origin in 50% of the patients, while, in contrast, that due to S. salivarius or S. bovis I was less frequently associated with a hepatobiliary origin (12% and 5%, respectively) (p<0.00001). The rate of penicillin resistance was 31% among S. salivarius isolates and 0% among S. bovis isolates (p<0.0001). In conclusion, the clinical characteristics of S. salivarius bacteremia and S. bovis II bacteremia are similar, and the isolation of S. salivarius in blood should not be systematically regarded as contamination.
TI  - A comparative field trial of cephalonium and cloxacillin for dry cow therapy for  mastitis in Australian dairy cows.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate and compare the therapeutic efficacy of dry cow agents  containing either cephalonium or cloxacillin within Australian dairy herds. DESIGN: A treatment-control trial. METHODS: Milk from infected quarters of cows with high somatic cell counts in milk on eight Australian dairy farms was cultured to identify bacterial pathogens. Cows were randomly assigned to treatment groups and one group was treated with cephalonium at drying off and the other group was treated with cloxacillin at drying off. Milk samples from infected quarters were collected immediately after calving and were cultured for pathogens. The effect of treatment on bacteriological cure was examined and somatic cell counts from infected cows from the first two herd tests after calving were examined for a treatment effect. On four farms, milk samples were collected for culture from all cases of clinical mastitis identified within the first 7 days after calving. The effect of treatment upon incidence of clinical mastitis after calving was examined. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between treatments on quarter cure rates for new infections, for chronic infections and for infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus uberis. Infected quarters treated with cephalonium had a significantly higher cure rate than quarters treated with cloxacillin when Corynebacterium bovis and Staphylococcus epidermids were included as pathogens combined (80.3% versus 70.7%). There was no significant difference between the treatments on somatic cell counts of infected cows at the first two herd tests after calving. There was no difference between treatments on the incidence of clinical mastitis in the first 7 days after calving.
TI  - Blood culture-negative endocarditis in a reference center: etiologic diagnosis of 348 cases.
AB  - To identify the current etiologies of blood culture-negative infective endocarditis and to describe the epidemiologic, clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic characteristics associated with each etiology, as well as with unexplained cases, we tested samples from 348 patients suspected of having blood culture-negative infective endocarditis in our diagnostic center, the French National Reference Center for Rickettsial Diseases, between 1983 and 2001. Serology tests for Coxiella burnettii, Bartonella species, Chlamydia species, Legionella species, and Aspergillus species; blood culture on shell vial; and, when available, analysis of valve specimens through culture, microscopic examination, and direct PCR amplification were performed. Physicians were asked to complete a questionnaire, which was computerized. Only cases of definite infective endocarditis, as defined by the modified Duke criteria, were included. A total of 348 cases were recorded-to our knowledge, the largest series reported to date. Of those, 167 cases (48%) were associated with C. burnetii, 99 (28%) with Bartonella species, and 5 (1%) with rare, fastidious bacterial agents of endocarditis (Tropheryma whipplei, Abiotrophia elegans, Mycoplasma hominis, Legionella pneumophila). Among 73 cases without etiology, 58 received antibiotic drugs before the blood cultures. Six cases were right-sided endocarditis and 4 occurred in patients who had a permanent pacemaker. Finally, no explanatory factor was found for 5 remaining cases (1%), despite all investigations.Q fever endocarditis affected males in 75% of cases, between 40 and 70 years of age. Ninety-one percent of patients had a previous valvulopathy, 32% were immunocompromised, and 70% had been exposed to animals. Our study confirms the improved clinical presentation and prognosis of the disease observed during the last decades. Such an evolution could be related to earlier diagnosis due to better physician awareness and more sensitive diagnostic techniques. As for Bartonella species, B. quintana was recorded more frequently than B. henselae (53 vs 17 cases). For 18 patients with Bartonella endocarditis, the responsible species was not identified. Species determination was achieved through culture and/or PCR in 49 cases and through Western immunoblotting in 22. Comparison of B. quintana and B. henselae endocarditis revealed distinct epidemiologic patterns. The 2 cases due to T. whipplei reflect the emerging role of this agent as a cause of infective endocarditis. Because identification of the bacterium was possible only through analysis of excised valves by histologic examination, PCR, and culture on shell vial, the prevalence of the disease might be underestimated. Among patients who received antibiotic drugs before blood cultures, 4 cases (7%) were found to be associated with Streptococcus species (2 S. bovis and 2 S. mutans) through 16S rDNA gene amplification directly from the valve, which shows the usefulness of this technique in overcoming the limitations of previous antibiotic treatment. Right-sided endocarditis occurred classically in young patients (mean age, 36 yr), intravenous drug users in 50% of cases, and suffering more often from embolic complications. Finally, 5 cases without etiology or explaining factors were all immunocompetent male patients with previous aortic valvular lesions, and 3 of the 5 presented with an aortic abscess. Further investigations should be focused on this group to identify new agents of infective endocarditis.

TI  - Recurrent Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess in a diabetic patient followed by Streptococcus bovis endocarditis--occult colon tumor plays an important role.
AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae is the leading cause of liver abscess in diabetic patients  in Taiwan. We report the case of a diabetic patient with a history of four episodes of K. pneumoniae liver abscess within 3 years. The patient later developed Streptococcus bovis bacteremia originating from a colon tumor with complications of endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and silent splenic abscess. Occult colon tumor may have played an important role in our case, with recurrent infection arising from colonizers of the gastrointestinal tract. As our case shows, the possible association between occult colon tumor and K. pneumoniae liver abscess in diabetic patients should be surveyed.

AB  - A study of 340 necropsied dairy cattle from northern Bavaria resulted in 31 animals (9%) showing evidence of pyemic thromboembolism. The most frequent pathomorphologic lesions consisted in endocarditis valvularis thromboticans of the tricuspid and/or mitral valve (21), embolic pneumonia (26), nephritis (13) and renal infarction (12). The most common isolate found in bacteriologic culture was Arcanobacterium pyogenes in 26 of 31 cases, followed by Staphylococcus aureus (2), Mannheimia haemolytica (2) and Streptococcus bovis (1) in rare cases. In 27 of 31 cows a possible cause of pyemic thromboembolism was found; in 23 cases claw diseases and decubital ulcera were probably responsible.
TI  - Genetic basis of antibiotic resistance in clinical isolates of Streptococcus gallolyticus (Streptococcus bovis).
AB  - Among 128 Streptococcus gallolyticus (Streptococcus bovis) isolates, 77.7% were resistant to tetracyclines and contained tet(M) and/or tet(L) and/or tet(O). A total of 59.4% had macrolide resistance and contained erm(B) and, rarely, mef(A). Among the one-third of isolates highly resistant to kanamycin and streptomycin, most harbored aphA3 and aad-6 genes.
TI  - WASP- mice exhibit defective immune responses to influenza A virus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Mycobacterium bovis BCG.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To quantify the immune response of WASP- mice to three different pathogens: influenza A virus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Mycobacterium bovis. METHODS: Primary and secondary T-cell responses to influenza A virus were quantified via tetramer assays. Viral clearance from lung was also measured. Lethality of intranasal inoculation with luminescent S. pneumoniae was assessed by dose escalation and direct luminescence imaging. After intravenous inoculation with M. bovis, residual mycobacteria in lung, liver, and spleen were measured by standard culture methods. RESULTS: The reduced secondary T-cell response to influenza A virus correlates with a relative but not absolute loss of splenic T and B cells similar to that seen in clinical Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS), and slower clearance of virus from lung. The reduced magnitude of the secondary T-cell response correlates with a progressive loss of influenza-specific T cells after primary inoculation. WASP- mice show an increased susceptibility to lethal pneumonia after intranasal inoculation with S. pneumoniae, which is among the most frequent causes of clinical complications in WAS patients. WASP- mice clear M. bovis bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) more slowly from lung, liver, and spleen. Bone marrow-derived macrophages, however, show normal ex vivo cytokine secretion in response to M. bovis. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that WASP- mice are functionally immunodeficient in regard to three different pathogens, and provide relevant end points for the study of treatment modalities in this model. They also suggest a specific physiologic mechanism, failure to accumulate memory T cells, for at least one of the defective immune responses.

TI  - Daptomycin tested against 915 bloodstream isolates of viridans group streptococci (eight species) and Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the activity of daptomycin tested against numerous species of viridans group streptococci and Streptococcus bovis, which are associated with wound infections, sepsis, cellulitis, endocarditis, abscesses and dental caries. The incidence of penicillin-resistant (non-susceptible) and MLS(B)-resistant strains among viridans group streptococci often varies by species. METHODS: The activity of daptomycin was compared with seven other antimicrobial classes using reference broth microdilution and disc diffusion methods tested against 915 bacteraemic isolates of streptococci (815 viridans group strains; 100 S. bovis). RESULTS: Among all species of viridans group streptococci and S. bovis, 99.9% of isolates were susceptible to daptomycin (MIC values, < or = 0.016-2 mg/L). In contrast, penicillin, erythromycin and tetracycline susceptibility varied widely between species. Erythromycin susceptibility was in the range 48.6-88.7%, penicillin susceptibility in the range 65.5-98.1% and tetracycline in the range 35.0-93.9%. The inter-method agreement between daptomycin and linezolid resistance (comparison agent) disc diffusion and broth microdilution test results was high, each showing near complete susceptibility (99.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Daptomycin is an active antimicrobial agent that has a usable potency against eight species of viridans group streptococci, as well as S. bovis, with all MIC values at < or =2 mg/L.
TI  - Effect of the microbial feed additive Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-1077 on protein and peptide degrading activities of rumen bacteria grown in vitro.
AB  - We investigated the potential of the ruminant feed additive Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-1077 on protein and peptide degrading activities of the rumen bacterial species Prevotella albensis M384, Streptococcus bovis 20480, and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 3071 grown in vitro. Alive or heat-killed yeast cells were added to bacterial cultures in a complex casein-glucose medium. After incubation of the cultures at 39 degrees C under O(2)-free CO(2), peptidase activities were determined in the absence or in the presence of yeasts. Protease activities were detected after PAGE in gelatin-copolymerized gels. In co-incubations of bacteria and live S. cerevisiae I-1077, proteinase activities were reduced compared to the activities in the bacterial monocultures. Measurement of peptidase activities and microbial enumerations in the co-incubations suggested that live yeasts and bacteria interacted in a competitive way, leading to a decrease in peptidase activities. The mechanism responsible for such an effect could be mainly a competition for substrate utilization, but the release of small competitive peptides by the yeast cells is also likely to be implicated.
TI  - In vitro activity of telithromycin against viridans group streptococci and Streptococcus bovis isolated from blood: antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in different groups of species.
AB  - The in vitro activities of penicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, and telithromycin were determined against 155 viridans group streptococci (VGS) and 18 Streptococcus bovis blood isolates. Heterogeneity in the susceptibility patterns and macrolide resistance phenotypes and genotypes in the different groups of VGS was detected. We found seven telithromycin-resistant S. bovis isolates all harboring the erm(B) gene.

TI  - Emergence of endocarditis due to group D streptococci: findings derived from the  merged database of the International Collaboration on Endocarditis.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to compare the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of Streptococcus bovis endocarditis with those of endocarditis caused by oral streptococci, using data obtained from a large international database of uniformly defined cases of infective endocarditis. S. bovis, a well-known cause of infective endocarditis, remains the common name used to designate group D nonenterococcal streptococci. In some countries, the frequency of S. bovis endocarditis has increased significantly in recent years. Data from the International Collaboration on Endocarditis merged database was used to identify the main characteristics of S. bovis endocarditis and compared them with those of infective endocarditis (IE) due to oral streptococci. The database contained 136 cases of S. bovis IE and 511 cases of IE due to oral streptococci. Patients with S. bovis IE were significantly older those with IE due to oral streptococci (63+/-16 vs. 55+/-18 years, P<0.00001). The proportion of streptococcal IE due to S. bovis increased from 10.9% before 1989 to 23.3% after 1989 (P=0.0007) and was 56.7% in France as compared with 9.4% in the rest of Europe and 6.0% in the USA (P<0.00001). Patients with S. bovis IE had more comorbidity and never used intravenous drugs. Complication rates, rates of valve replacement, and mortality rates were similar in the two groups. In conclusion, this study confirmed that S. bovis IE has unique characteristics when compared to endocarditis due to oral streptococci and that it emerged in the 1990s, mainly in France, a finding that is yet unexplained.
TI  - Coaggregation profiles of the microflora from root surface caries lesions.
AB  - Bacterial coaggregation reactions between different species and the auto aggregation of the same species are associated with the initiation and development of dental plaque and biofilms. As no such data is available on isolates from root caries lesions, we evaluated, by a visual, semi-quantitative scoring system and a spectrophotometric, quantitative assay, the coaggregation of 22 different wild-type microbial species comprising ten bacterial genera and a single Candida spp. The quantitative coaggregation assay we used proved to be a more sensitive method than the semi-quantitative, visual evaluation as the results yielded the percent coaggregation. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus bovis II/2 and Gemella morbillorum were observed having higher degrees of autoaggregation than the other examined strains. Significant levels of inter-species coaggregation was seen between: (1) Actinomyces spp. and Veillonella spp.; (2) Actinomyces israelii and Peptostreptococcus prevotii; (3) Campylobacter gracilis and Actinomyces spp.; (4) Prevotella intermedia and nine different species; and (5) Fusobacterium nucleatum and six other species. The single Candida albicans isolate did not coaggregate to a significant extent with any of the 21 bacterial isolates studied. Scanning electron microscopy observation of the coaggregation interactions between bacterial pairs having strong coaggregation reactions revealed varying adhesive patterns. Our findings on coaggregation amongst these isolates imply existence of multiple interactions between the coaggregation-inducing bacterial species in root caries. In particular, Actinomyces spp., Veillonella spp., Prevotella spp. and Fusobacterium spp. appear to play a significant role in this context.
TI  - ARDRA and RAPD analyses of human and animal isolates of Streptococcus gallolyticus.
AB  - A total of 23 Streptococcus gallolyticus strains, consisting of 12 strains from feces of healthy animals and 11 from clinical cases of human or cow mastitis milk, were examined genealogically. Four strains of S. bovis "biotype II/1" and 3 strains of S. equinus, the closely related organisms to S. gallolyticus, were also analyzed for outgroup comparison. Neither the amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) nor the randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis that had been designed to recognize S. gallolyticus strains virulent in pigeons could differentiate clinical strains from the others of S. gallolyticus. No correspondence between the DNA profile in either analysis and the host animal species was detected.

TI  - The influence of endoscopic procedures upon the contamination of Helicobacter pylori cultures.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Among the various diagnostic methods for the detection of Helicobacter pylori infection, histological examination and microbiological processing of gastric biopsy samples are assumed to be the gold standard techniques. AIMS: Since H. pylori culture can be affected by the presence of non-H. pylori bacteria, we evaluated the efficacy of endoscope disinfection and the influence of endoscopic procedures on culture contamination. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The procedures used during the first two routine endoscopies were evaluated during 28 consecutive days. Endoscopy room, forceps and endoscopic channel were analyzed before and after the beginning of normal procedures. After disinfection, a biopsy simulation was performed to verify the gastric bacteria. RESULTS: Endoscope disinfection removed all organisms from forceps and endoscopic channel with 100% efficacy. The most frequent non-H. pylori bacteria detected were Streptococcus bovis, Enterobacter hormaechei, and Staphylococcus aureus. The sensibility of the H. pylori culture was affected by the presence of non-H. pylori bacteria. CONCLUSION: The risk of transmission of microorganisms was not detectable when sterilized biopsy forceps and stringent disinfection standards were employed. Whilst S. bovis and E. hormaechei may be common in gastric microbial flora, the presence of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus indicated that the manipulation of biopsies could be responsible for culture contamination with these bacteria.

AB  - Although most physicians and the public are primarily concerned about the risk of transmitting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis virus during a platelet transfusion, bacterial contamination is actually the most common infectious complication. Unlike red blood cells, platelets are stored at room temperature (20-24 degrees C), which raises the risk of bacterial proliferation. The risk of bacterial sepsis is 2.5-fold higher for each unit of transfused platelets compared to each unit of red blood cells. We report an unusual case of Streptococcus bovis septic shock associated with a contaminated platelet transfusion.
TI  - Molecular characterization and transcription of the luxS gene that encodes LuxS autoinducer 2 synthase in Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - Presence of the luxS gene that encodes LuxS autoinducer 2 (AI-2) synthase in Streptococcus bovis was demonstrated, and the molecular properties and transcription of the gene were examined. The S. bovis luxS was transcribed in a monocistronic fashion. Intracellular luxS-mRNA increased sharply during the initial exponential growth, and decreased abruptly after the middle exponential phase. The large drop in luxS transcription began before the glucose supply to cells decreased or the growth rate declined. Transcription of luxS was not directly related to cell density, and continued at a maximal rate when cells were kept growing at a maximal rate. It is conceivable that AI-2 activity in S. bovis acts as a signal for adjusting cell physiology and metabolism in response to environmental conditions. However, the role of LuxS in S. bovis, including the regulation of AI-2 synthesis,, remains to be clarified.
TI  - Protozoa involved in butyric rather than lactic fermentative pattern during latent acidosis in sheep.
AB  - We used six ruminally cannulated Texel wethers to study the relative role of protozoa and lactate-metabolizing bacteria in ruminal fermentative patterns during an induced latent acidosis. The sheep were fed an alfalfa hay diet (H) and latent acidosis was induced, following a short transition period of one week, with a grain-rich acidotic diet (W, 60% wheat + 40% alfalfa hay). Ruminal pH, ruminal volatile fatty acids (VFA), lactate and NH3 concentrations, protozoa and lactate-utilizing bacterial counts, the relative proportions of three main bacteria implicated in lactate metabolism (a lactate-producing species, Streptococcus bovis, and two lactate-utilizing species, Selenomonas ruminantium, and Megasphaera elsdenii) using specific 16S-rRNA-targeting oligonucleotide probes, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity were determined for both diets. The pH parameters (mean, minimum, maximum, time and area under pH 6.0 and 5.5) measured with the W diet were indicative of a latent (i.e., subacute and maintained) acidosis. However, a butyric rather than lactic latent acidosis was observed in this study. Total ruminal lactate concentration remained at low levels with the acidotic diet (< 4 mmol x L(-1)), but changes were observed in VFA composition, which was oriented towards butyrate at the expense of acetate (P < 0.05), while propionate remained constant. In agreement with the low ruminal lactate concentration, no changes in the proportion of S. bovis 16S-rRNA were observed. The lactate-metabolizing bacterial population also remained fairly constant in number, proportion and activity. The increase in butyrate concentration was accompanied by a proliferation of entodiniomorphs (P < 0.01). These results suggest that the protozoa limited lactate accumulation and possibly also the decrease in pH during latent acidosis. Experiments with defaunated and faunated sheep could provide further evidence of the role of protozoa in the development of rumen latent acidosis.
TI  - Vasculitic purpura with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-positive acute renal  failure in a patient with Streptococcus bovis case and Neisseria subflava bacteremia and subacute endocarditis.
AB  - Subacute bacterial endocarditis is frequently associated with extracardiac manifestations and renal failure. Clinical variety of endocarditis manifestation is wide and has the potential to mimic vasculitis. Whereas Streptococcus bovis is often isolated and associated with colonic tumors, Neisseriaceae are rarely found. An association of subacute bacterial endocarditis and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies has been described. We report on a 62-year-old man who was admitted to our hospital with acute oliguric renal failure and a nonpruritic purpural rush without fever. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody diagnostic revealed perinuclear staining with a titre of 1 : 512 and antiproteinase-3 specificity. Immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis without extracapillary proliferation was diagnosed in renal biopsy. Finally, blood cultures became positive for Streptococcus bovis and Neisseria flava. Echocardiography showed mobile vegetations on tricuspid valve. Under treatment with penicillin G and gentamicin, skin efflorescences and renal function recovered, but vegetations increased. A colonic tumor could be excluded, a disastrous dental status may have been a predisposal factor. When classical findings of subacute bacterial endocarditis are less clear, the presence of renal failure and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in absence of fever may lead to misdiagnosis and deleterious immunosuppressive therapy. Neisseria subflava, an upper respiratory tract commensal, may cause subacute bacterial endocarditis without typical symptoms.
TI  - Characterization of Streptococcus bovis from the rumen of the dromedary camel and Rusa deer.
AB  - AIMS: Isolation and characterization of Streptococcus bovis from the dromedary camel and Rusa deer. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bacteria were isolated from the rumen contents of four camels and two deer fed lucerne hay by culturing on the semi-selective medium MRS agar. Based on Gram morphology and RFLP analysis seven isolates, MPR1, MPR2, MPR3, MPR4, MPR5, RD09 and RD11 were selected and putatively identified as Streptococcus. The identity of these isolates was later confirmed by comparative DNA sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene with the homologous sequence from S. bovis strains, JB1, C14b1, NCFB2476, SbR1, SbR7 and Sb5, from cattle and sheep, and the Streptococcus equinus strain NCD01037T. The percentage similarity amongst all strains was >99%, confirming the identification of the camel isolates as S. bovis. The strains were further characterized by their ability to utilize a range of carbohydrates, the production of volatile fatty acids (VFA) and lactate and the determination of the doubling time in basal medium 10 supplemented with glucose. All the isolates produced l-lactate as a major fermentation end product, while four of five camel isolates produced VFA. The range of carbohydrates utilized by all the strains tested, including those from cattle and sheep were identical, except that all camel isolates and the deer isolate RD11 were additionally able to utilize arabinose. CONCLUSIONS: Streptococcus bovis was successfully isolated from the rumen of camels and deer, and shown by molecular and biochemical characterization to be almost identical to S. bovis isolates from cattle and sheep. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Streptococcus bovis is considered a key lactic acid producing bacterium from the gastrointestinal tract of ruminants, and has been implicated as a causative agent of lactic acidosis. This study is the first report of the isolation and characterization of S. bovis from the dromedary camel and Rusa deer, and suggests a major contributive role of this bacterium to fermentative acidosis.
TI  - Use of community genome arrays (CGAs) to assess the effects of Acacia angustissima on rumen ecology.
AB  - This research developed a community genome array (CGA) to assess the effects of Acacia angustissima on rumen microbiology. A. angustissima produces non-protein amino acids as well as tannins, which may be toxic to animals, and CGA was used to assess the effects of this plant on the ecology of the rumen. CGAs were developed using a 7.5 cmx2.5 cm nylon membrane format that included up to 96 bacterial genomes. It was possible to separately hybridize large numbers of membranes at once using this mini-membrane format. Pair-wise cross-hybridization experiments were conducted to determine the degree of cross-hybridization between strains; cross-hybridization occurred between strains of the same species, but little cross-reactivity was observed among different species. CGAs were successfully used to survey the microbial communities of animals consuming an A. angustissima containing diet but quantification was not precise. To properly quantify and validate the CGA, Fibrobacter and Ruminococcus populations were independently assessed using 16S rDNA probes to extracted rRNA. The CGA detected an increase in these populations as acacia increased in the diet, which was confirmed by rRNA analysis. There was a great deal of variation among strains of the same species in how they responded to A. angustissima. However, in general Selenomonas strains tended to be resistant to the tannins in the acacia while Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens was sensitive. On the other hand some species, like streptococci, varied. Streptococcus bovis-like strains were sensitive to an increase in acacia in the diet while Streptococcus gallolyticus-like strains were resistant. Strep. gallolyticus has independently been shown to be resistant to tannins. It is concluded that there is significant variation in tannin resistance between strains of the same species. This implies that there are specific molecular mechanisms at play that are independent of the phylogenetic position of the organism.
TI  - Molecular characterization of CcpA and involvement of this protein in transcriptional regulation of lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate formate-lyase in the ruminal bacterium Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - A ccpA gene that encodes global catabolite control protein A (CcpA) in Streptococcus bovis was identified and characterized, and the involvement of CcpA in transcriptional control of a gene (ldh) encoding lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and a gene (pfl) encoding pyruvate formate-lyase (PFL) was examined. The ccpA gene was shown to be transcribed as a monocistronic operon. A catabolite-responsive element (cre) was found in the promoter region of ccpA, suggesting that ccpA transcription in S. bovis is autogenously regulated. CcpA required HPr that was phosphorylated at the serine residue at position 46 (HPr-[Ser-P]) for binding to the cre site, but glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, and NADP had no effect on binding. Diauxic growth was observed when S. bovis was grown in a medium containing glucose and lactose, but it disappeared when ccpA was disrupted, which indicates that CcpA is involved in catabolite repression in S. bovis. The level of ccpA mRNA was higher when cells were grown on glucose than when they were grown on lactose, which was in line with the level of ldh mRNA. When cells were grown on glucose, the ldh mRNA level was lower but the pfl mRNA level was higher in a ccpA-disrupted mutant than in the parent strain, which suggests that ldh transcription is enhanced and pfl transcription is suppressed by CcpA. The ccpA-disrupted mutant produced less lactate and more formate than the parent, probably because the mutant had reduced LDH activity and elevated PFL activity. In the upper region of both ldh and pfl, a cre-like sequence was found, suggesting that the complex consisting of CcpA and HPr-[Ser-P] binds to the possible cre sites. Thus, CcpA appears to be involved in the global regulation of sugar utilization in S. bovis.

TI  - Bovine mastitis in Finland 2001--prevalence, distribution of bacteria, and antimicrobial resistance.
AB  - A nationwide survey was conducted in Finland to estimate prevalence of bovine mastitis, distribution of mastitis pathogens, and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of different mastitis pathogens. In total, 12,661 quarter milk samples were collected from 3282 dairy cows at 216 farms. These were randomly selected from a database covering all Finnish dairy farms. Quarter milk samples collected by the dairy advisors were submitted for somatic cell counting, bacteriological examination, and testing for antimicrobial susceptibility. If the milk SCC of a cow or of a quarter exceeded 300,000/mL, the cow was defined as having mastitis. The results were compared with those of a previous survey done in 1995. The prevalence of mastitis continued to decrease from 38% in 1995 to 31% in 2001. Compared with the study from 1995, the number of quarters with bacterial growth in 2001 increased significantly from 21.0 to 33.5%. This mainly resulted from increased prevalence of Corynebacterium bovis. Coagulase-negative staphylococci remained the most common bacterial group, comprising almost one-half of the pathogens isolated, whereas the relative number of Staphylococcus aureus isolations decreased from the time of the previous study. According to in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the enterococci demonstrated the highest level of resistance. Compared with the other Nordic countries, penicillin resistance among the staphylococci was still at a relatively high level in Finland (52.1 and 32.0% for Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, respectively). Streptococci isolated from mastitis were very susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, as also found in the previous survey in 1995.
TI  - Efficacy of extended ceftiofur intramammary therapy for treatment of subclinical  mastitis in lactating dairy cows.
AB  - Little research has focused on treatment of cows with subclinical mastitis during lactation. Ceftiofur is a new broad-spectrum, third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic for veterinary use that inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by interfering with enzymes essential for peptidoglycan synthesis. Ceftiofur should be effective against a wide range of contagious and environmental mastitis pathogens. Objectives of the present study were to evaluate the efficacy of ceftiofur for treatment of subclinical mastitis in lactating dairy cows, and to determine if extended therapy regimens enhanced efficacy of ceftiofur. Holstein and Jersey dairy cows (n = 88) from 3 dairy research herds were used. Cows were enrolled in the study based on milk somatic cell counts >400,000/mL and isolation of the same mastitis pathogen in 2 samples obtained 1 wk apart. Cows with one or more intramammary infections (IMI) were blocked by parity and DIM and allocated randomly to 1 of 3 different ceftiofur treatment regimens: 2-d (n = 49 IMI), 5-d (n = 41 IMI), and 8-d (n = 38 IMI) treatment regimens. For all groups, 125 mg of ceftiofur hydrochloride was administered via intramammary infusion. Eighteen cows with 38 IMI were included as an untreated negative control group. A bacteriological cure was defined as a treated infected mammary quarter that was bacteriologically negative for the presence of previously identified bacteria at 14 and 28 d after the last treatment. Efficacy of ceftiofur therapy against all subclinical IMI was 38.8, 53.7, and 65.8% for the 2-, 5-, and 8-d ceftiofur treatment regimens, respectively. Four of 38 (10.5%) IMI in control cows were cured spontaneously without treatment. All 3 ceftiofur treatment regimens were significantly better than the negative control, and the 8-d extended ceftiofur treatment regimen treatment group was significantly better than the standard 2-d treatment group. Pathogen groups had significantly different cure rates from one another. The cure rate for the 8-d extended ceftiofur treatment regimen was 70% for Corynebacterium bovis, 86% for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, 36% for Staph. aureus, 80% for Streptococcus dysgalactiae ssp. dysgalactiae, and 67% for Strep. uberis.
TI  - Molecular characteristics of phosphoenolpyruvate: mannose phosphotransferase system in Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - To elucidate the regulatory mechanism of catabolite control in Streptococcus bovis, we investigated the molecular properties and gene expression of the mannose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-dependent sugar: phosphotransferase system (PTS). The mannose PTS gene cluster (man) was found to comprise a gene encoding enzyme (E) II AB (manL) and genes encoding EIIC (manM), EIID (manN), and a putative regulator (manO). The gene cluster (man operon) was transcribed from one transcriptional start site, which was located 40 bp upstream of the manL start codon. However, two transcriptional start sites were found between manN and manO in primer extension analysis, and the manO may be transcribed independently from the man operon. The man operon and manO were constitutively transcribed without being affected by culture conditions, such as the sugar supplied (glucose, galactose, fructose, maltose, lactose, sucrose, or mannose), growth rate, or pH.
TI  - Influence of dipeptidyl peptidase inhibitors on growth, peptidase activity, and ammonia production by ruminal microorganisms.
AB  - The aim was to investigate known and potential new inhibitiors of dipeptidyl peptidases (DPP) for their effects on ruminal microorganisms. Gly-Phe diazomethylketone (GPD), Ala-Ala chloromethylketone (AAC), benserazide (DL-serine 2-(2,3,4- trihydroxybenzyl) hydrazide), and diprotin A (Ile-Pro-Ile) inhibited DPP activities of Prevotella albensis, P. ruminicola, P. bryantii, P. brevis, and mixed ruminal microorganisms, though incompletely and, except for diprotin A, without absolute specificity for any of the peptidases. Leucine aminopeptidase activity of Streptococcus bovis was also inhibited by GPD and benserazide. The inhibitors had no effect on the growth of the bacteria, except for GPD, which inhibited growth of P. albensis when only peptides were available for growth. Benserazide had some inhibitory effects on the growth of Megasphaera elsdenii and Prevotella spp., even in the absence of peptides. The predatory activity of ciliate protozoa on bacteria was unaffected by DPP inhibitors. Ammonia production from casein by mixed ruminal microorganisms was inhibited significantly (P < 0.05) by AAC (29% inhibition) and benserazide (33%). It was concluded that DPP inhibitors can influence the rate of NH3 production in the rumen and may form the basis for developing protein-sparing feed additives for ruminants.
TI  - Direct production of ethanol from raw corn starch via fermentation by use of a novel surface-engineered yeast strain codisplaying glucoamylase and alpha-amylase.
AB  - Direct and efficient production of ethanol by fermentation from raw corn starch was achieved by using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae codisplaying Rhizopus oryzae glucoamylase and Streptococcus bovis alpha-amylase by using the C-terminal-half region of alpha-agglutinin and the flocculation functional domain of Flo1p as the respective anchor proteins. In 72-h fermentation, this strain produced 61.8 g of ethanol/liter, with 86.5% of theoretical yield from raw corn starch.
TI  - Improved survival in experimental sepsis with an orally administered inhibitor of apoptosis.
AB  - The pathophysiology of sepsis involves excessive lymphocyte apoptosis, which correlates with adverse outcomes, and disordered cytokine production, which may promote host injury. As the protease inhibitor (PI) class of antiretroviral agents is known to prevent apoptosis in vitro, we evaluated their effect on survival, lymphocyte apoptosis, and consequent cytokine production in mice with sepsis induced by cecal ligation and perforation. Mice pretreated with PIs have improved survival (67%; P<0.0005) compared with controls (17%) and a significant (P<0.05) reduction in lymphocyte apoptosis. Even mice receiving therapy beginning 4 h after perforation demonstrated improved survival (50%; P<0.05) compared with controls. PI therapy is also associated with an increase in the Th1 cytokine TNF-alpha (P<0.05) early in sepsis and a reduction in the Th2 cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 (P<0.05) late in sepsis; despite no intrinsic antibacterial effects, PI also reduced quantitative bacterial blood cultures. The beneficial effects of PI appear to be specific to lymphocyte apoptosis, as lymphocyte-deficient Rag1-/- mice did not experience benefit from treatment with PI. Thus, inhibition of lymphocyte apoptosis by PI is a candidate approach for the treatment of sepsis.
TI  - Simple and rapid PCR method for identification of streptococcal species relevant  to animal infections based on 23S rDNA sequence.
AB  - A PCR identification system targeting 23S rDNA sequences for the identification of eight streptococcal species relevant to animal infections (Streptococcus agalactiae, S. bovis, S. canis, S. dysgalactiae, S. equi, S. porcinus, S. suis and S. uberis) was developed. This system consists of two PCR reactions, A and B, in which seven and eight primers, respectively, are used simultaneously, and was designed so that each amplification product indicates a species by its size. A total of 111 cultures, including the type strain of eight species, could be successfully identified and differentiated as individual species, except for the cross reactivity between S. bovis and S. equinus. The developed PCR system can complete the identification procedure for eight streptococcal species through two tube reactions per isolate, and, therefore, might provide a rapid, simple and accurate diagnostic tool for veterinary laboratories.
TI  - Association of Streptococcus bovis bacteremia with colonic neoplasia and extracolonic malignancy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The association between Streptococcus bovis bacteremia and colonic neoplasia is well described; however, the relationship between S bovis and neoplasia outside the colon has not been well evaluated. HYPOTHESIS: S bovis bacteremia may be associated with colonic neoplasia and extracolonic malignancy. DESIGN: Retrospective review of all documented cases of S bovis bacteremia identified by a search of computerized bacteriology records. SETTING: One tertiary referral hospital and 1 community hospital located in the same city. PATIENTS: Forty-five patients (41 adults, 4 children) with documented S bovis bacteremia during a 12-year period were identified. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Available patient records were reviewed to identify the presence of colonic neoplasia, the use of gastrointestinal endoscopy, and the presence of gastrointestinal or extraintestinal malignancies. RESULTS: Seventeen patients (41% of adult patients) underwent colonoscopy. Colonic neoplasia was present in 16 patients (39% of adults), with 3 of these patients having invasive colorectal cancer (7% of adults). Invasive cancer was present in 13 patients (32% of adults). Eight patients had malignant lesions arising within the gastrointestinal tract, and 5 patients had extraintestinal malignancies. CONCLUSION: S bovis bacteremia is associated with both colonic neoplasia and extracolonic malignancy.
TI  - Effects of the overexpression of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase on fermentation pattern and transcription of the genes encoding lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate formate-lyase in a ruminal bacterium, Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - Whether fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) triggers the transcriptional regulation of the gene expression of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and pyruvate formate-lyase (PFL) in Streptococcus bovis was examined by constructing a recombinant strain that overexpresses FBP aldolase (FBA). When the recombinant strain was grown on glucose, intracellular FBP was much lower as compared to the parent strain, whereas dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) were slightly higher. Intracellular ATP and ADP were slightly lower, but the NADH/NAD(+) ratio was not different. When glucose was replaced by lactose, a less readily utilized substrate, there was no great difference in FBP, DHAP, GAP, or adenine nucleotides. Overexpression of FBA decreased the level of LDH-mRNA, and increased the level of PFL-mRNA. Consequently, FBP concentration was positively related to the LDH-mRNA level and inversely related to the PFL-mRNA level. On the contrary, DHAP and GAP concentrations were positively related to the PFL-mRNA level and inversely related to the LDH-mRNA level. The levels of these mRNA were proportional to the amounts of corresponding enzymes in cells. As a result, the ratio of formate to lactate produced was increased by the overexpression of FBA. From these results, it could be presumed that FBP is involved in the transcriptional control of LDH and PFL synthesis in S. bovis.
TI  - New group D streptococcal species.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: The heterogeneity of group D streptococci led to the identification of various biotypes of Streptococcus equinus and Streptococcus bovis and to the description of new species. The objective of the present study was to improve the phenotypic delineation between species and to clarify their respective phylogenetic position. METHODS: Physiological and genomic analyses were carried out in 84 representative strains of the group D streptococci. Biotypes were determined with the API 20 strep and rapid ID 32 STREP systems of identification. Quantitative DNA-DNA hybridization under stringent conditions and values of the deltaT(m) allowed to delineate species and subspecies. The phylogenic position of the different genomic groups was determined by comparing the sequences of their 16S rDNA. RESULTS: Four DNA-clusters, including seven species or subspecies, were characterized. Differential associations of biochemical characters allowed their identification. S. equinus and the type strain of S. bovis belonged to a single species. S. gallolyticus, S. bovis biotype II.2, and S. macedonicus formed a single DNA-cluster including three different subspecies. These were designated as S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, and S. gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus. The two other DNA-clusters corresponded to the two subspecies of S. infantarius, and to S. alactolyticus. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: This study presented a new classification associated with an identification scheme of group D streptococci. The changes in this classification demonstrate the interest of a polyphagic approach of the bacterial identification.
TI  - Changing incidence of detected streptococcal bacteraemia in North Yorkshire, England.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Streptococcal bacteraemia remains a major and challenging clinical problem throughout the world. The epidemiology of these infections appears to be changing. In the present study we analysed the data collected over a period of 20 yr (1978-1999) to throw light on this. METHODS: Laboratory records of all patients yielding clinically significant, non-pneumococcal, nonenterococcal streptococcal bacteraemia were reviewed for the decades 1978-1988 and 1990-1999 in the two districts (combined population 260,000). RESULTS: From a total of 3134 patients with detected bacteraemia 338 (10.8%) yielded streptococci. The organisms comprised: in the beta-haemolytic group (n=169), GAS (32%), GBS (34%), GCS (5%), GGS (28%), GRS (1%); in the non-haemolytic/Streptococcus milleri group (n=160): S. milleri (21%), S. bovis (10%), S. sanguis (30%), S.mitis (10%), S. oralis (8%) and other 'viridans' streptococci (20%); nine isolates were of anaerobic streptococci. There was a steady increase in the number of blood cultures submitted for investigation during the period and streptococcal isolations of all species rose in proportion (approximately x 2.5) in the second decade compared with the first. Complementary data on the occurrence of necrotising fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome in these districts suggested a real increase in the occurrence of serious forms of GAS infection. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: An increase in the level of detected streptococcal bacteraemia was seen in this part of England over 20 yr, involving a wide variety of different streptococcal species. This represented both improved ascertainment of infection and an increase in the burden of disease in the population.
TI  - [Fever, malaise and new onset mitral valve insufficiency. Subacute Streptococcus  bovis mitral valve endocarditis ].
AB  - A 62-year-old patient with low grade fever, fatigue, arthralgia and newly discovered mitral regurgitation was diagnosed with subacute endocarditis. Streptococcus bovis grew from all six blood culture bottles. Streptococcus bovis is known to be associated with gastrointestinal neoplasias. Therefore a colonoscopy was performed and two polyps were removed. Histological analysis revealed a tubulovillous adenoma and a serrated adenoma. Colonoscopy is mandatory for all patients with Streptococcus bovis endocarditis even without any symptoms for colorectal neoplasia. The significance of Streptococcus bovis for the carcinogenesis of colorectal neoplasias and the possible alternative pathway for colorectal carcinomas through serrated adenomas will be discussed.
TI  - Non-life-threatening sepsis: report of two cases.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis is one of the nonenterococcal species included among the streptococci group D. It is part of the normal bowel flora in humans and animals, but it is also responsible for infectious diseases (10-15% of all cases of bacterial endocarditis). Many cases of bacteremia and metastatic abscesses (spleen, liver, soft tissues, bone, meninges, endocardium) caused by S. bovis were reported as associated with digestive tract diseases, mainly colonic disease, and, in particular colonic neoplasms, or chronic liver diseases. A role in carcinogenesis has been suggested for this microorganism. The authors report two cases of S. bovis sepsis, one associated with colonic neoplasm and the other with liver cirrhosis and gastric carcinoma. Discussion is focused on probable mechanisms that favor gastric colonization and systemic diffusion of S. bovis from the gut in patients with gastrointestinal neoplasms or chronic liver disease and provides clinical recommendations for patients with S. bovis infections.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis endocarditis and its association with chronic liver disease:  an underestimated risk factor.
AB  - Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of Streptococcus bovis endocarditis  were prospectively studied among 199 patients with definite endocarditis. Thirty patients (15.1%) had S. bovis endocarditis. Compared with patients with non-S. bovis endocarditis, these 30 patients were older (mean age, 58.6+/-12.4 years vs. 46.0+/-17.0 years; P<.001) and had higher rates of bivalvular involvement (43.3% vs. 7.7%; P<.001), embolism (73.3% vs. 40.2%; P=.002), and diskitis (23.3% vs. 0.6% P<.001). In patients with S. bovis biotype I (S. bovis I) endocarditis, advanced liver disease was present in 56.7%, compared with 15.3% of patients with non-S. bovis endocarditis (P<.001), and colonic adenoma was present in 46.7%. The in-hospital mortality rate (16.7%) was correlated with delayed diagnosis and advanced liver diseases. In our city, S. bovis I endocarditis is frequently correlated with liver diseases; diskitis may be the first sign of the disease.
TI  - Resistance of rumen bacteria murein to bovine gastric lysozyme.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lysozymes, enzymes mostly associated with defence against bacterial infections, are mureinolytic. Ruminants have evolved a gastric c type lysozyme as a digestive enzyme, and profit from digestion of foregut bacteria, after most dietary components, including protein, have been fermented in the rumen. In this work we characterized the biological activities of bovine gastric secretions against membranes, purified murein and bacteria. RESULTS: Bovine gastric extract (BGE) was active against both G+ and G- bacteria, but the effect against Gram- bacteria was not due to the lysozyme, since purified BGL had only activity against Gram+ bacteria. We were unable to find small pore forming peptides in the BGE, and found that the inhibition of Gram negative bacteria by BGE was due to an artefact caused by acetate. We report for first time the activity of bovine gastric lysozyme (BG lysozyme) against pure bacterial cultures, and the specific resistance of some rumen Gram positive strains to BGL. CONCLUSIONS: Some Gram+ rumen bacteria showed resistance to abomasum lysozyme. We discuss the implications of this finding in the light of possible practical applications of such a stable antimicrobial peptide.
TI  - Antimicrobial spectrum and activity of NVP PDF-713, a novel peptide deformylase inhibitor, tested against 1,837 recent Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - Continued emergence of antimicrobial resistances among gram-positive pathogens requires further development of compounds with novel modes of action. The peptide deformylase inhibitor NVP PDF-713 was tested against 1,837 recent strains of Gram-positive organisms. All NVP PDF-713 MICs were at < or = 4microg/mL except for 6 enterococci (0.3% of strains overall). NVP PDF-713 MIC(90) results were: Staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic and viridans group streptococci and Streptococcus bovis at 1 microg/ml; coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Listeria spp. at 2 microg/mL; and the enterococci at 4 microg/mL. NVP PDF-713 appears to be a promising new agent worthy of continued in vivo development.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and macrolide resistance genes of viridans  group streptococci from blood cultures in Korea.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to study the antimicrobial susceptibilities and macrolide resistance mechanisms of viridans group streptococci (VGS) in a Korean tertiary hospital. METHODS: MICs of five antimicrobials were determined for 106 VGS isolated from blood cultures. The macrolide resistance mechanisms of erythromycin non-susceptible isolates were studied by the double-disc test and PCR. RESULTS: In all, 42.4% of the isolates were susceptible to penicillin. Nine of 61 penicillin non-susceptible isolates were fully resistant (MIC >/= 4 mg/L). Rates of non-susceptibility to erythromycin, clindamycin and ceftriaxone were 33.9%, 17.9% and 9.4%, respectively. Twenty-two (61.1%) of 36 erythromycin non-susceptible isolates expressed constitutive resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B antibiotics (a constitutive MLS(B) phenotype); 13 isolates (36.1%) expressed an M phenotype; and one isolate, a Streptococcus bovis isolate, had an inducible MLS(B) resistance phenotype. erm(B) was found in isolates with constitutive/inducible MLS(B) phenotypes, and mef(A) in isolates with the M phenotype. In three isolates (two isolates with a constitutive MLS(B) phenotype and in one isolate with the M phenotype), none of erm(A), erm(B), erm(C) or mef(A) was detected by PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Penicillin non-susceptible VGS were more resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin and ceftriaxone than were penicillin-susceptible isolates. A constitutive MLS(B) phenotype associated with erm(B) was the predominant mechanism of macrolide resistance among erythromycin non-susceptible isolates from this Korean hospital.
TI  - The use of PCR for the identification and characterisation of bacteriocin genes from bacterial strains isolated from rumen or caecal contents of cattle and sheep.
AB  - PCR primers were designed to amplify the gene that encodes bovicin 255 from Streptococcus gallolyticus LRC0255 and the bacteriocin genes from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens strains AR10 and OR79A (bviD and bvi79A) in order to screen for their incidence in rumen and caecal B. fibrisolvens and Streptococcus bovis-like isolates from New Zealand and North American ruminants. None of the B. fibrisolvens-like strains (n=34) isolated from New Zealand or North America had the genes encoding for butyrivibriocins AR10 (bviD) or OR79 (bvi79A). However, seven S. bovis isolates from New Zealand ruminants and three from North American animals had the bovicin 255 gene. Sequence comparison of cloned bovicin 255 PCR products indicated a 92.9-95.7% similarity to that of the corresponding bovicin 255 gene sequence of S. gallolyticus. Four of the New Zealand bovicin 255 positive S. bovis isolates were from the caecal contents of the same sheep and had identical PFGE profiles. Two other S. bovis isolates sharing the same PFGE profile were isolated from a separate animal from the same flock. PFGE analysis of the North American strains indicated that all three were closely related as two of three had identical PFGE profiles with the remaining isolate differing only by a single band position. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of the 10 isolates were at least 99.8% identical to S. bovis. All 10 S. bovis isolates having the gene for bovicin 255 produced bacteriocin activity that inhibited the growth of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius D1 in a deferred antagonism plating (DAP) assay. Certain S. bovis isolates obtained from ruminants have bacteriocin activity associated with a distinct bovicin 255 gene sequence but it appears that bacteriocin production by the rumen anaerobe B. fibrisolvens may be uncommon in strains isolated from cattle and sheep in New Zealand.
TI  - Bacteremic Streptococcus bovis infections at a university hospital, 1992-2001.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The association of Streptococcus bovis biotypes with types of clinical infection and underlying malignancies has rarely been reported in Taiwan. The aim of this study was to characterize the clinical features and microbiological characteristics of patients with S. bovis bacteremia. METHODS: From January 1992 to December 2001, 62 patients with S. bovis bacteremia were treated at National Taiwan University Hospital. Their demographic characteristics, clinical features, results of imaging studies, pathological findings, and laboratory data were retrospectively analyzed. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined using the agar dilution method and biotypes were determined using the API 20 Strep system. RESULTS: The majority of cases (76%) occurred during the 1996-1997 and 1999-2000 periods. Thirty five patients were male, and the mean age of the 62 patients was 61 years. Underlying diseases included malignancies (40%), cardiac diseases (27%), diabetes mellitus (24%), and liver cirrhosis (21%). Fifty two percent (n = 32) of patients presented with primary bacteremia and 24% (15) with definite or possible infective endocarditis. Thirteen percent (8) presented with hepatobiliary infections (acute cholecystitis and biliary tract infection). Ten patients (16%) had polymicrobial bacteremia. All of the concomitant pathogen(s) were Gram-negative rods, among which Escherichia coli predominated. The mortality rate on day 30 of illness was 21%. High Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score on the day of positive blood culture was associated with high mortality. Among the 19 patients (31%) who underwent colonoscopy, 9 (47%) had colonic lesions (tubular adenomas or carcinomas). Of the 26 patients (41%) who underwent echocardiography, 14 (54%) had vegetation in the valves. Of the 47 S. bovis isolates examined for biotypes, 37 (79%) were biotype II (29 of biotype II/2 and 8 of biotype II/1) and 10 (21%) were biotype I. The majority of isolates causing primary bacteremia (92%), hepatobiliary infections (100%) and primary bacterial peritonitis (100%) were biotype II, while 67% of isolates associated with infective endocarditis were biotype I. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin. CONCLUSIONS: Infective endocarditis should be highly suspected in patients with bacteremia due to S. bovis biotype I. Investigations for intra-abdominal foci other than the colon should be undertaken in patients with bacteremia caused by S. bovis biotype II. Due to the increasing number of S. bovis bacteremia patients at the hospital and unknown origins of about 50% of bacteremia cases, the need for colonoscopy and echocardiography in each case and biotyping of each blood isolate should be emphasized.
TI  - Causative organisms of infective endocarditis according to host status.
AB  - A prospective study of infective endocarditis (IE) was conducted between 1994 and 2000 in Marseilles, France, and included 170 definite cases diagnosed with the use of modified Duke criteria. Classification of IE based on the aetiological agent was related to epidemiological characteristics, including age, gender and the nature of the injured valve. Enterococci and Streptococcus bovis were identified more frequently in older subjects (p 0.02), and S. bovis was also associated with mitral valve infection (p 0.03). Streptococcus spp. were found to be associated with native valves (p < 10(-3)), whereas coagulase-negative staphylococci and Coxiella burnetii were associated with intracardiac prosthetic material (p < 0.05). S. bovis and Staphylococcus aureus were the predominant species associated with presumably healthy valves (p < 0.05), whereas oral streptococci caused IE exclusively in patients with previous valve damage. The basic host status of IE patients has been linked to specific microorganisms, and this may be of value when empirical treatment is needed in patients who have received previous antibiotic therapy and whose blood cultures are negative.

TI  - The value of comparison.
AB  - With the number of published microbial genomes now in excess of 100, any new genome that is sequenced is likely to have a close relative available for comparison. Indeed, it is increasingly difficult to perform any genomic analysis that is not comparative. This should, however, not be seen as a drawback; it is often the case that a large amount of information can be drawn from these comparisons, especially between closely related organisms. Several genome sequences published recently indicate the value of comparisons at the genomic level.
TI  - Otitis in cattle, an aetiological review.
AB  - Otitis externa in cattle has a significant impact in tropical and subtropical regions, and the aetiological agents are predominantly rhabditiform nematodes and mites of the genus Raillietia. Its prevalence is higher in mature and Zebu cattle. In advanced clinical cases there can be irreversible and fatal neural lesions. Ear infection in calves has been associated with concurrent respiratory diseases and mixed infection. The principal reported agents of otitis in calves are bacteria such as Actinomyces spp., Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus somnus, Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas spp., Streptococcus spp. and Mycoplasma bovis. The control and treatment of bovine otitis is not standardized and there is little evidence-based support for the diverse treatments available in the literature.
TI  - [Streptococcus bovis infectious endocarditis: clinical and epidemiological characteristics].
AB  - This paper shows our experience concerning the study of Streptococcus bovis infectious endocarditis (EI): 47 patients, with no prior history of IV drug abuse (NTD), who suffered EI caused by Streptococcus bovis were excerpted from a case record of 1053 cases with diagnosis of EI defined in accordance with Duke's Hospital criteria. For each patient we considered age, sex, complications, echocardiographic findings, antibiotic therapy, eventual heart-surgery and final outcome of the disease. We then compared the parameters of our patients, with the ones of 216 NTD patients suffering non Streptococcus bovis EI, selected according to age correspondence and concomitant onset of the disease. The characteristics of Streptococcus bovis EI are analogous to the ones of EIs caused by other micro-organisms in NTD patients, except for a non statistically significant trend of higher frequency in old age and in males. Concerning possible predisposing conditions, we considered the association extensively described in the literature between Streptococcus bovis EI and gastroenteric pathology (above all colon neoplasms): this association was not frequently observed in our study because appropriate instrumental investigations of the digestive tract were carried out only in a minority of patients.
TI  - Effect of pH on the activity of bovicin HC5, a bacteriocin from Streptococcus bovis HC5.
AB  - The bacteriocin, bovicin HC5, catalyzed potassium efflux from Streptococcus bovis JB1, and this activity was highly pH dependent. When the pH was near neutral, glucose-energized cells were not affected by bovicin HC5, but the intracellular steady-state concentration of potassium decreased at acidic pH values. The idea that pH was affecting bovicin HC5 binding was supported by the observation that acidic pH also enhanced the efflux of potassium from non-energized cells that had been loaded with potassium. The relationship between bovicin HC5 concentration and potassium depletion was a saturation function, but cooperativity plots indicated that the binding of one bovicin molecule to the cell membrane facilitated the binding of another.
TI  - rpoB gene sequence-based identification of aerobic Gram-positive cocci of the genera Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Gemella, Abiotrophia, and Granulicatella.
AB  - We developed a new molecular tool based on rpoB gene (encoding the beta subunit of RNA polymerase) sequencing to identify streptococci. We first sequenced the complete rpoB gene for Streptococcus anginosus, S. equinus, and Abiotrophia defectiva. Sequences were aligned with these of S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, and S. pneumoniae available in GenBank. Using an in-house analysis program (SVARAP), we identified a 740-bp variable region surrounded by conserved, 20-bp zones and, by using these conserved zones as PCR primer targets, we amplified and sequenced this variable region in an additional 30 Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Gemella, Granulicatella, and Abiotrophia species. This region exhibited 71.2 to 99.3% interspecies homology. We therefore applied our identification system by PCR amplification and sequencing to a collection of 102 streptococci and 60 bacterial isolates belonging to other genera. Amplicons were obtained in streptococci and Bacillus cereus, and sequencing allowed us to make a correct identification of streptococci. Molecular signatures were determined for the discrimination of closely related species within the S. pneumoniae-S. oralis-S. mitis group and the S. agalactiae-S. difficile group. These signatures allowed us to design a S. pneumoniae-specific PCR and sequencing primer pair.
TI  - The effect of pH and a bacteriocin (bovicin HC5) on Clostridium sporogenes MD1, a bacterium that has the ability to degrade amino acids in ensiled plant materials.
AB  - Fresh plant materials can be fermented and preserved as silage for cattle, but clostridia that deaminate amino acids increase pH. If the pH of the silage rises, spoilage microorganisms proliferate, and undesirable products accumulate. Rod-shaped, anaerobic bacteria with spores were isolated from fresh alfalfa, fresh corn, and silages. Strain MD1 had the highest specific activity of amino acid deamination, and it was most closely related to Clostridium botulinum A and B. However, because strain MD1 did not produce a toxin, it was classified as Clostridium sporogenes. Washed cell suspensions of C. sporogenes MD1 had specific activities as great as 690 nmol ammonia mg protein(-1) min(-1), and this rate did not decrease until the pH was less than 4.5. Batch cultures of C. sporogenes MD1 did not initiate growth if the initial pH was less than 5.0, but continuous cultures (0.1 h(-1) dilution rate) persisted until the pH in the culture vessel was 4.6. When C. sporogenes MD1 was co-cultured with a bacteriocin-producing Streptococcus bovis HC5, ammonia production was greatly reduced. The ability of S. bovis HC5 to inhibit strain MD1 was pH-dependent. When the pH was 5.5 or less, strain MD1 could no longer be detected. These latter results support the idea that bacteriocin-producing bacteria may be used to improve silage quality.
TI  - Carcinogenic properties of proteins with pro-inflammatory activity from Streptococcus infantarius (formerly S.bovis).
AB  - Several studies reported linkage between bacterial infections and carcinogenesis. Streptococcus bovis was traditionally considered as a lower grade pathogen frequently involved in bacteremia and endocarditis. This bacterium became important in human health as it was shown that 25-80% of patients who presented a S.bovis bacteremia had also a colorectal tumor. Moreover, in previous experiments, we demonstrated that S.bovis or S.bovis wall extracted antigens (WEA) were able to promote carcinogenesis in rats. The aim of the present study was: (i) to identify the S.bovis proteins responsible for in vitro pro-inflammatory properties; (ii) to purify them; (iii) to examine their ability to stimulate in vitro IL-8 and COX-2 expression by human colon cancer cells; and (iv) to assess in vivo their pro-carcinogenic potential in a rat model of colon carcinogenesis. The purified S300 fraction, as determined by proteomic analysis, contained 72 protein spots in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis representing 12 different proteins able to trigger human epithelial colonic Caco-2 cells and rat colonic mucosa to release CXC chemokines (human IL-8 or rat CINC/GRO) and prostaglandins E2, correlated with an in vitro over-expression of COX-2. Moreover, these proteins were highly effective in the promotion of pre-neoplastic lesions in azoxymethane-treated rats. In the presence of these proteins, Caco-2 cells exhibited enhanced phosphorylation of the three classes of MAP kinases. Our results show a relationship between the pro-inflammatory potential of S.bovis proteins and their pro-carcinogenic properties, confirming the linkage between inflammation and colon carcinogenesis. These data support the hypothesis that colonic bacteria can contribute to cancer development particularly in chronic infection/inflammation diseases where bacterial components may interfere with cell function.
TI  - Bovicin HJ50, a novel lantibiotic produced by Streptococcus bovis HJ50.
AB  - A bacteriocin-producing strain was isolated from raw milk and named Streptococcus bovis HJ50. Like most bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria, bovicin HJ50 showed a narrow range of inhibiting activity. It was sensitive to trypsin, subtilisin and proteinase K. Bovicin HJ50 was extracted by n-propanol and purified by SP Sepharose Fast Flow, followed by Phenyl Superose and Sephadex G-50. Treatment of Micrococcus flavus NCIB8166 with bovicin HJ50 revealed potassium efflux from inside the cell in a concentration-dependent manner. The molecular mass of bovicin HJ50 was determined to be 3428.3 Da. MS analysis of DTT-treated bovicin HJ50 suggested that bovicin HJ50 contains a disulfide bridge. The structural gene of bovicin HJ50 was cloned by nested PCR based on its N-terminal amino acid sequence. Sequence analysis showed that it encodes a 58 aa prepeptide consisting of an N-terminal leader sequence of 25 aa and a C-terminal propeptide domain of 33 aa. Bovicin HJ50 shows similarity to type AII lantibiotics. Chemical modification using an ethanethiol-containing reaction mixture showed that two Thr residues are modified.
TI  - Molecular characteristics and transcription of the gene encoding a multifunctional alcohol dehydrogenase in relation to the deactivation of pyruvate formate-lyase in the ruminal bacterium Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - To clarify the deactivation mechanism of pyruvate formate-lyase (PFL) and its role in the regulation of fermentation in Streptococcus bovis, the molecular properties and genetic expression of multifunctional alcohol dehydrogenase (ADHE) were investigated. S. bovis was found to have ADHE, which was deduced to consist of 872 amino acids with a molecular mass of 97.4 kDa. The ADHE was shown to harbor three enzyme activities: (1) alcohol dehydrogenase, (2) coenzyme-A-linked acetaldehyde dehydrogenase that catalyzes the conversion of acetyl-CoA to ethanol, and (3) PFL deactivase. Similar to Escherichia coli ADHE, S. bovis ADHE required Fe2+ for its activity. The gene encoding ADHE ( adhE) was shown to be monocistronic. The level of adhE mRNA changed in parallel with the mRNA levels of the genes encoding PFL (pfl) and PFL-activating enzyme (act) as the growth conditions changed, although these genes are independently transcribed. Synthesis of ADHE, PFL-activating enzyme, and PFL appears to be regulated concomitantly. Overexpression of ADHE did not cause a change in the formate-to-lactate ratio. It is conceivable that ADHE is not significantly involved in the reversible inactivation of active PFL under anoxic conditions. Partition of the flow from pyruvate appears to be mainly regulated by the activities of lactate dehydrogenase and PFL.
TI  - A case of septicaemia, meningitis and pneumonia caused by Streptococcus bovis type II.
AB  - We present a case of septicaemia, pneumonia and meningitis due to Streptococcus bovis type-II in a patient who had undergone a total hip prosthesis under general anaesthesia three weeks earlier. This organism is an uncommon human pathogen that sometimes causes bacteraemia and endocarditis and is usually connected with colon pathology and dental procedures. In the reported case, there were no risk factors for S. bovis infection except for the hip operation. S. bovis type II sensitive to penicillin was isolated from all blood and pleural fluid cultures. The patient recovered and was discharged from hospital two weeks after presentation.

TI  - Inhibition of Listeria monocytogenes by bovicin HC5, a bacteriocin produced by Streptococcus bovis HC5.
AB  - Cattle can be infected with Listeria monocytogenes by consuming contaminated plant materials, soil or silage, and farmers have sought ways of preventing this contamination. Recent work indicated that Streptococcus bovis HC5 produced a bacteriocin (bovicin HC5) that could inhibit a variety of gram-positive bacteria, and we examined the ability of bovicin HC5 to inhibit 10 strains of L. monocytogenes that had been isolated from plant materials, soil, silage and infected cattle. Growth experiments indicated that all of the L. monocytogenes strains were inhibited by 100 activity units (AU) of bovicin HC5 ml(-1). L. monocytogenes cultures that were transferred with sublethal doses (12.5 AU ml(-1)) could be adapted in stepwise fashion to higher doses of bovicin HC5. However, even 'adapted' cultures did not grow if 400 AU ml(-1) was added. The effect of bovicin HC5 on L. monocytogenes was bactericidal, and viability decreased 5-7 logs after only 2 h of exposure. Bovicin HC5 caused a nearly complete efflux of intracellular potassium in 15 min but only if the pH was less than 6.0. When the pH was greater than 6.0, the cells maintained their potassium pool. L. monocytogenes cells that were acid-adapted (final pH of 4.6) were as sensitive to bovicin HC5 as those that were not acid-adapted (final pH of 6.3). These results support the idea that bovicin HC5 could be effective in controlling listeria in contaminated silages.
TI  - Infective endocarditis due to Streptococcus bovis in a series of nonaddict patients: clinical and morphological characteristics of 20 cases and review of the literature.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Controversy frequently exists about the actual frequency of Streptococcus bovis infective endocarditis (IE), its incidence of malignancy and its outcome. Consequently, the characteristics of S bovis IE were examined in an unselected population of nondrug-addicted patients. The literature was also reviewed. METHODS: Nondrug-addicted patients with S bovis IE were retrospectively reviewed. Clinically definite IE was diagnosed according to the Duke classification criteria at the single reference hospital for a defined population in northwestern Spain over a 13-year period. The clinical features, need for surgery and mortality rate of these patients were compared with those of other nondrug-addicted patients with IE examined during the same time period. RESULTS: Between 1987 and 1999, S bovis IE was diagnosed in 20 consecutive patients. This pathogen was responsible for 16.8% of the cases of definite IE in nondrug-addicted patients. Underlying conditions and embolic septic events were common. The aortic valve was the most common site of IE. Simultaneous involvement of two cardiac valves and moderate to severe regurgitation were more common in patients with S bovis IE. Colonic neoplasms were observed in 77% of patients. However, in-hospital mortality rate, need for in-hospital surgery and surgery during follow-up did not differ between patients with S bovis IE and the other nondrug-addicted patients with IE. CONCLUSIONS: In unselected patients, the rate of mortality due to S bovis IE is similar to that observed in IE due to other microorganisms. However, colonoscopic evaluation during admission and follow-up is required.
TI  - Late infection of a total knee arthroplasty with Streptococcus bovis in association with carcinoma of the large intestine.
AB  - Infection of a total knee arthroplasty with Streptococcus bovis in a 76-year-old  man that led to the diagnosis of a bowel carcinoma is reported. Investigation revealed a malignancy in the ascending colon with extension into the adrenal gland. S bovis in conjunction with colonic neoplasia has been reported in several orthopedic conditions: vertebral osteomyelitis, discitis, lateral neck abscess, and osteomyelitis of the ileum. The relationship of S bovis to endocarditis, meningitis, brain abscesses, and peritonitis has also been well described. However, S bovis is a rare pathogen infecting joint prostheses and should raise the possibility of a gastrointestinal lesion.
TI  - Evaluation of the microbiological status of milk and various structures in mammary glands from naturally infected dairy cows.
AB  - A knowledge of the microbiological status of milk and of the different structures in the mammary glands has great importance in elucidating the pathogenesis of mammary gland infections. The objective of this study was to evaluate the microbiological status of various structures in the mammary glands from naturally infected dairy cows following slaughter. A total of 94 samples of milk, 184 samples of mammary parenchyma, 168 samples of gland cisterns, and 168 samples of teat cisterns were collected for microbiological examination. Microorganisms were detected in 59.9% of all samples, 67.0% of the milk samples, 70.1% of the mammary parenchymas, 55.9% of the gland cisterns and 48.8% of the teat cistern samples. When all samples were considered, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus were the most prevalent (35.7%) followed by coagulase-positive Staphylococcus (12.2%), Corynebacterium bovis (2.4%), Prototheca sp. (1.9%), and Streptococcus dysgalactiae (1.5%). There was a significantly higher occurrence of microorganisms in the milk and mammary parenchyma compared to the gland cisterns and teat cisterns.
TI  - Verrucous endocarditis associated with Streptococcus bovis in mink (Mustela vison).
AB  - Between 1998 and 2001, mortalities due to verrucous endocarditis were experienced at several mink farms. Gram-positive cocci were isolated from the endocardium of all the animals examined but not always from other internal organs. Almost all the isolates were identified as Streptococcus bovis and only a few isolates belonged to other Streptococcus species. Typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of a selection of isolates revealed several patterns and several different clones. Attempts to reproduce disease by the injection of cultures of a field isolate into healthy mink failed.
TI  - Geographical difference of disease association in Streptococcus bovis bacteraemia.
AB  - From 1996 to 2001, 48 Streptococcus bovis strains were isolated from blood cultures of 37 patients in one hospital. Median patient age was 68 years (range: 1 day-88 years). The male : female ratio was 23 : 14. Most patients (97 %) had underlying diseases, including biliary tract disease in 14 (38 %), diabetes mellitus in 12 (32 %), liver parenchymal disease in seven (19 %), carcinoma of the colon in four (11 %) and other malignancies in four (11 %). No infective foci (indicative of primary bacteraemia) were identified in 15 patients (40 %) and 14 (38 %) had acute cholangitis/cholecystitis, but only four (11 %) had infective endocarditis. Two (5 %), three (8 %) and 32 (87 %) patients had S. bovis of biotypes I, II/1 and II/2, respectively, and three (8 %), two (5 %) and 32 (87 %) patients had S. bovis of genotypes 1, 2a and 2b, respectively. All isolates were sensitive to penicillin, cephalothin and vancomycin, 24 (65 %) were resistant to erythromycin and 15 (41 %) were resistant to clindamycin (these strains were also resistant to erythromycin). Thirteen isolates that were erythromycin- and clindamycin-resistant possessed the ermB gene, 10 possessed the ermT gene and one possessed both the ermB and ermT genes. Overall, seven patients (19 %) died. In contrast to most other reports from western countries, where carcinoma of the colon and infective endocarditis were the major underlying disease and infective focus associated with S. bovis bacteraemia, biliary tract disease and acute cholangitis and/or cholecystitis were the major underlying diseases associated with S. bovis bacteraemia in our locality.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance patterns of vancomycin-resistant Streptococcus equinus isolated from animal foods and epidemiological typing of resistant S. equinus by microbial uniprimer kit.
AB  - Raw milk samples, and cow and chicken intestines were tested to isolate vancomycin-resistant, gram-positive bacteria. From these samples, we isolated seven vancomycin-resistant Streptococcus equinus, two vancomycin-resistant viridans Streptococcus and two vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The MICs of several antibiotics, including vancomycin, against these strains were tested. Seven isolates of S. equinus showed high level resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin (>100 microg/mL). The cell wall thickness of these strains was compared with that of the sensitive strain by TEM and no differences were obserbed between these strains. We compared the strains of vancomycin-resistant Streptococcus equinus using PCR with Microbial Uniprimer Kit. We concluded that it is necessary to combine other methods in order to cluster and identify all isolates of S. equinus.
TI  - Septic arthritis due to Streptococcus bovis in a patient with cirrhosis of enolic etiology.
AB  - We present a case of bacteremia and septic arthritis due to Streptococcus bovis biotype I after shock, in a patient with liver cirrhosis of enolic etiology. Diagnosis was made based on a clinical setting of fever and a painful shoulder. The presence of colonic neoplasia was ruled out in this patient and the bacteremia developed without endocarditis.
TI  - [Metabolism of rumen microbial populations formed on biosubstrates with different assimilation under the effect of pentachlorophenol].
AB  - It has been established that metabolism of mixed microbial population formed on easy assimilated sources of energy and nitrogen (concentrate diet) progressed on higher level. There is increase of amilolytic activity, formation of lactate, ammonia, low molecular carbonic acids with predomination of propionate molar fraction. The increased resistance to effect of pentachlorophenol (PCP) is characteristic nature of the latter. The role of the most resistant synthrophic bacteria to PCP increases. The pure strains of Streptococcus bovis and Megasphaera elsdenii do not stop metabolism at 100 microM of PCP. Mixed population of microorganisms formed on hard accessible biosubstrates (cellulose) and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens have the increased cellulosolytic activity and while the high sensibility even to low doses of PCP (10-40 microM) is observed. It has been supposed that mechanism of PCP effect is ambiguous for various species of microbial complex of rumen. It's effect strength on all main chains of metabolism (membrane transport, energetic exchange, protein biosynthesis, etc.) significantly depends on capacity of pool of metabolic intermediates formed as a result of definite program of biotechnology of nurture, but significantly decreases the harmful effect of biocides.
TI  - Establishing populations of Megasphaera elsdenii YE 34 and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens YE 44 in the rumen of cattle fed high grain diets.
AB  - AIM: To determine whether Megasphaera elsdenii YE34 (lactic acid degrader) and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens YE44 (alternative starch utilizer to Streptococcus bovis) establish viable populations in the rumen of beef cattle rapidly changed from a forage-based to a grain-based diet. METHODS AND RESULTS: Five steers were inoculated with the two bacterial strains (YE34 and YE44) and five served as uninoculated controls. With the exception of one animal in the control group, which developed acidosis, all steers rapidly adapted to the grain-based diet without signs of acidosis (pH decline and accumulation of lactic acid). Bacterial populations of S. bovis, B. fibrisolvens and M. elsdenii were enumerated using real-time Taq nuclease assays. Populations of S. bovis remained constant (except in the acidotic animal) at ca 10(7) cell equivalents (CE) ml-1 throughout the study. Megasphaera elsdenii YE34, was not detectable in animals without grain in the diet, but immediately established in inoculated animals, at 10(6) CE ml-1, and increased 100-fold in the first 4 days following inoculation. Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, initially present at 10(8) CE ml-1, declined rapidly with the introduction of grain into the diet and was not detectable 8 days after grain introduction. CONCLUSION: Megasphaera elsdenii rapidly establishes a lactic acid-utilizing bacterial population in the rumen of grain-fed cattle 7-10 days earlier than in uninoculated cattle. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The study has demonstrated that rumen bacterial populations, and in particular the establishment of bacteria inoculated into the rumen for probiotic use, can be monitored by real-time PCR.
TI  - Ability of lysozyme and 2-deoxyglucose to differentiate human and bovine Streptococcus bovis strains.
AB  - Human and bovine Streptococcus bovis strains had the same 16S ribosomal DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism and often had the same patterns of starch, mannitol, lactose, and raffinose utilization. PCRs of BOX sequences differed, but numerical analyses indicated that some human strains clustered with bovine strains. However, human and bovine strains had distinctly different sensitivities to lysozyme and 2-deoxyglucose.
TI  - Microbial and physiological characterization of weakly amylolytic but fast-growing lactic acid bacteria: a functional role in supporting microbial diversity in pozol, a Mexican fermented maize beverage.
AB  - Pozol is an acid beverage obtained from the natural fermentation of nixtamal (heat- and alkali-treated maize) dough. The concentration of mono- and disaccharides from maize is reduced during nixtamalization, so that starch is the main carbohydrate available for lactic acid fermentation. In order to provide some basis to understand the role of amylolytic lactic acid bacteria (ALAB) in this fermented food, their diversity and physiological characteristics were determined. Forty amylolytic strains were characterized by phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. Four different biotypes were distinguished via ribotyping; Streptococcus bovis strains were found to be predominant. Streptococcus macedonicus, Lactococcus lactis, and Enterococcus sulfureus strains were also identified. S. bovis strain 25124 showed extremely low amylase yield relative to biomass (139 U g [cell dry weight](-1)) and specific rate of amylase production (130.7 U g [cell dry weight](-1) h(-1)). In contrast, it showed a high specific growth rate (0.94 h(-1)) and an efficient energy conversion yield to bacterial cell biomass (0.31 g of biomass g of substrate(-1)). These would confer on the strain a competitive advantage and are the possible reasons for its dominance. Transient accumulation of maltooligosaccharides during fermentation could presumably serve as energy sources for nonamylolytic species in pozol fermentation. This would explain the observed diversity and the dominance of nonamylolytic lactic acid bacteria at the end of fermentation. These results are the first step to understanding the importance of ALAB during pozol fermentation.

AB  - Many surface epithelial cells express adrenomedullin, a multifunctional peptide found in a wide number of body and cell systems. Recently, we and others have proposed that adrenomedullin has an important novel role in host defense. This peptide has many properties in common with other cationic antimicrobial peptides, including the human beta-defensins. Upon exposure of human gastric epithelial cells to viable cells of invasive or noninvasive strains of Helicobacter pylori, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, or Streptococcus bovis, a significant increase in adrenomedullin secretion from these cells was demonstrated. Adrenomedullin gene expression was also increased in response to these microorganisms. Similar observations were noted when these cells were incubated with proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha and lipopolysaccharide. In cultured cells and an animal infection model, increased adrenomedullin peptide and gene expression was demonstrated when exposed to E. coli or Mycobacterium paratuberculosis, respectively. The data suggest there is a strong association between epithelial infection, inflammation, and adrenomedullin expression, which may have clinical relevance. The regulation of adrenomedullin expression may have therapeutic applications, such as improving or enhancing mucosal immunity.
TI  - Neonatal sepsis caused by Streptococcus bovis variant (biotype II/2): report of a case and review.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis is an uncommon cause of infection in neonates. However, S. bovis is capable of causing fulminant neonatal sepsis or meningitis that is indistinguishable clinically from that caused by group B streptococcus. S. bovis and S. bovis variant (sometimes referred to as S. bovis biotypes I and II, respectively) are phenotypically similar but may be differentiated by expanded testing. In adults, specific associations between disease states and different biotypes of S. bovis are apparent. No data exist on possible differences or clinical relevance of neonatal infection caused by different biotypes or newer species of S. bovis. We report a 3-day-old neonate with bacteremia and meningitis caused by S. bovis variant (S. bovis biotype II/2) and review the literature.
TI  - Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis caused by Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - The first case of Streptococcus bovis peritonitis associated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) in a 40-year-old Chinese woman suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus is reported. Streptococcus bovis is part of the normal flora in the human intestine and, less commonly, the female genital tract. Being a rare cause of peritonitis, the possible link between genital tract colonization by Streptococcus bovis and retrograde invasion of the peritoneal cavity is postulated to be the cause of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis peritonitis in this patient. Since invasive Streptococcus bovis infection is associated with gastrointestinal pathology (Streptococcus bovis biotype I) and chronic liver diseases (Streptococcus bovis biotype II), identifying the biotype of Streptococcus bovis could guide treatment by indicating that further investigation of these underlying diseases is required.
TI  - Reappraisal of the taxonomy of the Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex and related species: description of Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus subsp. nov., S. gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus subsp. nov. and S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus subsp. nov.
AB  - 'Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus' is a large bacterial complex including different species frequently isolated from infections of humans (Streptococcus gallolyticus, Streptococcus infantarius) or animals (S. bovis, S. equinus, Streptococcus alactolyticus). The separation of S. bovis into three different biotypes has been partially correlated with genetic differentiation. In addition, recent advances in bacterial phylogeny have led to the inclusion of Streptococcus macedonicus and Streptococcus waius in this complex. The aim of this study was to improve physiological differentiation between species related to the complex and to clarify their respective phylogenetic positions. In this study, physiological, genetic and phylogenetic analyses of a set of 88 streptococcal strains were performed. The diversity of strains of S. bovis biotype II was analysed, and it was confirmed that they belong to different species, either S. equinus or S. infantarius. It was demonstrated that S. gallolyticus, S. bovis biotype II.2, S. macedonicus and S. waius form a single DNA cluster separated into three different subspecies. They are delineated by different biochemical traits, limited DNA-DNA relatedness and noticeable divergence in 16S rDNA sequences. According to the current definition of species, the names S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus subsp. nov., S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus subsp. nov. and S. gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus subsp. nov. are proposed for these three subspecies.
TI  - Ischemic stroke and splenic rupture in a case of Streptococcus bovis endocarditis.
AB  - A 58-year-old man with an acute stroke suffered from splenic rupture. Streptococcus bovis was found in blood cultures, and gram-negative cocci were found in the infarcted spleen. Hemorrhagic transformation of the stroke occurred. Echocardiography showed aortic endocarditis. Cardiac surgery was not performed because of concern about cerebral bleeding. The patient died due to cerebral rehemorrhage after 3 weeks.
TI  - Expression of Ruminococcus albus xylanase gene ( xynA) in Streptococcus bovis 12-U-1.
AB  - The objective of this study was to ligate the xylanase gene A ( xynA) isolated from Ruminococcus albus 7 into the promoter and signal-peptide region of the lichenase [beta-(1,3-1,4)-glucanase] gene of Streptococcus bovis JB1. This fusion gene was inserted into the pSBE11 vector, and the resulting recombinant, plasmid pXA, was used to transform S. bovis 12-U-1 cells. The transformant, S. bovis 12UXA, secreted the xylanase, which was stable against freeze-thaw treatment and long-time incubation at 37 degrees C. The introduction of pXA and production of xylanase did not affect cell growth, and the xylanase produced degraded xylan from oat-spelt and birchwood.
TI  - Infectious endocarditis from Streptococcus bovis associated with colonic carcinoma: case report and literature review.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many studies in the literature have warned of the need for investigation of colonic lesions among patients, especially elderly ones, who have bacteremia and/or endocarditis from Streptococcus bovis. Bacteremia and infectious endocarditis from Streptococcus bovis may be related to the presence of neoplastic lesions in the large intestine and hepatic disease. AIM: This report describes a patient who presented infectious endocarditis from Streptococcus bovis associated with colonic carcinoma and tubular-villous adenomas. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of this bacterium among patients with septicemia and/or endocarditis is also related to the presence of villous or tubular-villous adenomas in the large intestine. For this reason, complete and detailed investigation of the large intestine must be performed in patients with infectious endocarditis, even in the absence of intestinal symptoms. An increased incidence of this condition or hepatic dysfunction has been reported among patients with infectious endocarditis from Streptococcus bovis. Patients with infectious endocarditis from Streptococcus bovis and normal colonoscopy may be included in the group at risk for developing colonic cancer. The knowledge that there is an association between endocarditis from Streptococcus bovis and carcinoma of the colon has important clinical implications. If the lesion can be discovered at an early stage, curative resection may become possible.
TI  - [Infectious endocarditis. A study of 50 patients in a non-university hospital].
AB  - The authors report the results of a single centre study of 50 consecutive patients (average age 66 +/- 14 years; 36 men), admitted between 1992 and 2001 to a peripheral hospital for infectious endocarditis (IE). The median interval to diagnosis was 57 days. There was an underlying cardiac disease in 52% of cases, usually valvular (42%). The site of the IE was the mitral valve in 21 cases, the aortic valve in 19 cases, mitro-aortic valves in 5 cases, native tricuspid valves in 2 cases and pacing catheters in 4 cases (associated with valvular endocarditis in one patient). The causal organism was usually a streptococcus (60%, including 28% of streptococcus bovis), or a staphylococcus (22%): no organism could be found in 7 patients. The average follow-up was 33 +/- 30 months: surgery was indicated in half the patients and 3 patients were turned down because of their poor general condition. In all, 34% of patients died (24% of their IE) in a median interval of 6 months, mainly from infectious or haemodynamic complications. Poor prognostic factors were: age > 70 years, "blind" antibiotic therapy, large-sized vegetations, embolism and renal failure. These data, comparable to the results observed in large series in the literature, underline the importance of multi-disciplinary management of IE and strict prophylaxis.
TI  - [Streptococcus bovis as an opportunistic pathogen during advanced HIV disease]
AB  - Three rare case reports of HIV-related Streptococcus bovis bacteremia are described, and discussed on the basis of a literature review. The association with an advanced immunodeficiency, leukopenia-neutropenia, and liver cirrhosis is underlined as well as the possibility of multiple recurrences and the lack of apparent gastrointestinal lesions as risk factors.
TI  - Isolated cerebrospinal fluid eosinophilia due to Streptococcus bovis meningitis in an infant.
AB  
TI  - Streptococcus bovis revisited: a clinical review of 81 bacteremic episodes paying special attention to emerging antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Following 2 Cases of Streprococcus bovis endocarditis with a high level of resistance to clindamycin during 2002, the authors reviewed their clinical experience with S. bovis bacteremia during 2 periods, starting in 1980. 81 episodes of S. bovis bacteremia represented approximately 1% of all episodes of bacteremia. In 32 (40%) cases the bacteremia represented endocarditis, in 15 (19%) the bacteremia originated from sick bowel, 11 (14%) were suspected to arise from urinary tract infection, 10 (12%) originated from biliary or peritoneal infection, and 13 from other or unknown sources. 25 (31%) of the bacteremias were polymicrobial. All of the isolates were highly susceptible to penicillin and clindamycin, with the following exceptions: 2 isolates had a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.5 mg/l to penicillin (in 1997) and 5 isolates had an MIC of > 2 mg/l to clindamycin (in 1997, 1998, 2000 and 2002). The 2 most recent of these 5 had high-level resistance to clindamycin of > 256 mg/l. It seems that clindamycin resistance in S. bovis is an emerging phenomenon, in contrast to penicillin resistance, high levels of which have not yet been described in S. bovis.
TI  - Identification of equine cecal bacteria producing amines in an in vitro model of  carbohydrate overload.
AB  - Acute laminitis has been associated with the overgrowth of gram-positive bacteria within the equine hindgut, causing the release of factor(s) leading to ischemia-reperfusion of the digits. The products of fermentation which trigger acute laminitis are, as yet, unknown; however, vasoactive amines are possible candidates. The objectives of this study were to use an in vitro model of carbohydrate overload to study the change in populations of cecal streptococci and lactobacilli and to establish whether certain species of these bacteria were capable of producing vasoactive amines from amino acids. Cecal contents from 10 horses were divided into aliquots and incubated anaerobically with either corn starch or inulin (fructan; both at 1 g/100 ml). Samples were taken at 6-h intervals over a 24-h period for enumeration of streptococci, lactobacilli, and gram-negative anaerobes by a dilution method onto standard selective growth media. The effects of the antibiotic virginiamycin (1 mg/100 ml) and calcium hydrogen phosphate (CaHPO(4); 0.3 g/100 ml) were also examined. Fermentation of excess carbohydrate was associated with increases in numbers of streptococci and lactobacilli (2- to 3.5-log unit increases; inhibited by virginiamycin) but numbers of gram-negative anaerobes were not significantly affected. A screening agar technique followed by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis enabled the identification of 26 different bacterial strains capable of producing one or more vasoactive amines. These included members of the species Streptococcus bovis and five different Lactobacillus spp. These data suggest that certain bacteria, whose overgrowth is associated with carbohydrate fermentation, are capable of producing vasoactive amines which may play a role in the pathogenesis of acute laminitis.
TI  - NO synthesis in human saliva.
AB  - Human saliva contains nitrate that is converted into nitrite by the activity of facultative, anaerobic bacteria of the oral cavity. Nitrite can be reduced to NO in the acidic gastric milieu; some NO may also form in the mouth at acidic pH values. In this paper, we show that bacteria (S. salivarius, S. mitis and S. bovis) isolated from saliva, may contribute to NO production in human saliva. NO formation by bacteria occurs at neutral pH values and may contribute to the antibacterial activity of saliva.
TI  - 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region sequence variation in Streptococcus thermophilus and related dairy streptococci and development of a multiplex ITS-SSCP analysis for their identification.
AB  - The 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of several Streptococcus thermophilus strains and some related dairy streptococci, S. macedonicus, S. salivarius and S. bovis, was analysed by sequence analysis. All the Streptococcus species were easily discriminated on the basis of sequence variations principally located upstream and downstream of the region encompassing the double-stranded processing sites and the tRNA(Ala) gene. Comparison between tRNA(Ala) gene sequences highlighted a high level of sequence conservation among the Streptococcus species investigated despite their belonging to separated phylogenetic clusters, i.e. the S. salivarius and S. bovis rRNA groups. A low but significant degree of variability was detected among the S. thermophilus strains, allowing the identification of four different ITS sequences. Similarity analysis of the ITS sequences showed that the Streptococcus species were clustered in two main branches, one containing S. macedonicus and S. bovis strains, and one containing S. thermophilus and S. salivarius strains. With the aim of developing a rapid tool for the identification of the dairy streptococci species a multiplex ITS-SSCP analysis of two discrete regions within the ITS locus was carried out.
TI  - [Streptococcus bovis endocarditis - predictor of colonic carcinoma? ].
AB  - The association of Streptococcus bovis endocarditis with colonic neoplasia is classically described and exceeds 50 percent. The prevalence of Streptococcus bovis in fecal cultures from patients with carcinoma of the colon is significantly increased (56%) as compared to that in controls (10%) and also in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (28%). Streptococcus bovis endocarditis is relatively benign, but it stresses the frequency of the associated colonic carcinoma, requiring colonoscopy and making the treatment of the high-risk lesion mandatory. The article covers a literature review and a case report.
TI  - Molecular characterization of HPr and related enzymes, and regulation of HPr phosphorylation in the ruminal bacterium Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - Molecular properties of HPr, enzyme I, and HPr kinase in Streptococcus bovis, and the regulation of HPr phosphorylation were examined. The genes encoding HPr (ptsH) and enzyme I (ptsI) were found to be cotranscribed. Two transcriptional start sites were detected in a region upstream of the HPr kinase gene (hprK). HPr kinase had both HPr-phosphorylating and HPr-dephosphorylating activities. The importance of phosphorylation of Ser-46 in HPr was shown by using a mutant HPr in which Ser-46 was replaced by Ala. When S. bovis was grown in glucose-limited medium, the amount of seryl-phosphorylated HPr (HPr-[Ser-P]) decreased drastically as the growth rate decreased. In contrast, the amount of histidyl-phosphorylated HPr (HPr-[His-P]) increased gradually as the growth rate decreased. The amount of HPr kinase did not greatly change with the growth phase, whereas the intracellular P(i) concentration increased as the growth rate decreased. HPr-[Ser-P] decreased as the intracellular P(i) increased as a consequence of inhibition of HPr kinase activity by P(i) and simultaneous enhancement of HPr-[Ser-P] phosphatase activity by P(i). Thus, it is conceivable that the ratio of HPr-[Ser-P] to HPr-[His-P] is regulated by the bifunctional activity of HPr kinase in response to intracellular P(i) concentration.
TI  - Diet influences the ecology of lactic acid bacteria and Escherichia coli along the digestive tract of cattle: neural networks and 16S rDNA.
AB  - In this manuscript, the authors have sought to gain a better understanding of the interactions between Escherichia coli and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from Rogossa MRS agar along the digestive tract of grain- and forage-fed cattle. E. coli from cattle receiving a high-grain diet were more numerous (P<0.05) than from the high-forage diet and the highest numbers were in the faeces. Isolates on Rogossa MRS agar were always greater in the high-grain diet (P<0.05) and contained a significant number of LAB. A random set of Rogossa MRS agar colonies was selected and artificial neural networks were used to develop a relationship between colony description and species which was validated using sequence analysis (16S rDNA). The neural networks correctly predicted species in more than 80 % of cases and was composed, primarily, of Lactobacillus vitulinus, Lactobacillus ruminis, Selenomonas ruminantium, Streptococcus bovis, Acidaminococcus fermentans and Megasphaera elsdenii. In conjunction with statistical diversity indices, it was demonstrated that diversity in the high-fibre diet was always lower and was a consequence of the dominance of Str. bovis. In contrast, the diversity in the high-grain diet was greater (P<0.05) and was a consequence of the decline in Str. bovis. These data demonstrate that there is a positive relationship between coliform and LAB isolates throughout the digestive tract of cattle, and diet is the major factor regulating bacterial composition.
TI  - Molecular diagnosis of infective endocarditis by PCR amplification and direct sequencing of DNA from valve tissue.
AB  - We used broad-range eubacterial PCR amplification followed by direct sequencing to identify microbial pathogens in heart valve material from 29 patients with histologically confirmed infective endocarditis and 23 patients free of infective endocarditis. Microorganisms cultured by conventional techniques matched those identified by PCR in 21 cases. PCR alone identified the causative agent in three cases (Streptococcus bovis, Staphylococcus cohnii, and Coxiella burnetii), allowing better patient management. PCR corrected the initial bacteriological diagnosis in three cases (Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus mutans, and Bartonella henselae). Among the 29 cases of histologically confirmed infective endocarditis, PCR findings were positive in 27 cases and were consistent with the bacterial morphology seen at Gram staining (26 cases) or with the results obtained by immunohistologic analysis with an anti-C. burnetii monoclonal antibody (one case). In two other cases of histologically confirmed infective endocarditis, PCR remained negative in a blood culture-negative case for which no bacteria were seen at histological analysis and in one case with visualization of cocci and blood cultures positive for Enterococcus faecalis. Ten clinical diagnoses of possible infective endocarditis were ruled out by histopathological analysis of the valves and subsequently by PCR. PCR was negative in 13 of the 14 patients in whom infective endocarditis was rejected on clinical grounds; the other patient was found to have Coxiella burnetii infective endocarditis on the basis of PCR and histopathological analysis and was subsequently included in the group of 29 definite cases. In total, PCR contributed to the diagnosis and management of infective endocarditis in 6 of 29 (20%) cases.
TI  - Regulation of lactate dehydrogenase synthesis in a ruminal bacterium, Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was purified from three strains of Streptococcus bovis, and the gene ldh was cloned and sequenced. The ldh of S. bovis from a goat (TH1) was different from the ldhs of two other strains from cattle (TH2, JB1) in that Asp(220) was substituted for Glu. Northern blot analysis revealed that the LDH-mRNA of S. bovis was approximately 1.0 kbp, which was transcribed in a monocistronic fashion. When cells were grown at pH 6.9 in a batch culture, the level of ldh transcript decreased as the growth phase changed; from exponential growth to the cessation of growth. The level of ldh transcript was higher in cells grown at pH 4.5 than at pH 6.9. This observation was consistent with the amounts of LDH in cells and the percentages of lactate produced. These results support the hypothesis that S. bovis regulates LDH synthesis at the transcriptional level probably in response to intracellular pH.
TI  - Lotus corniculatus condensed tannins decrease in vivo populations of proteolytic  bacteria and affect nitrogen metabolism in the rumen of sheep.
AB  - Condensed tannins in forage legumes improve the nutrition of sheep by reducing ruminal degradation of plant protein and increasing crude protein flow to the intestine. However, the effects of condensed tannins in forage legumes on rumen bacterial populations in vivo are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the specific effects of condensed tannins from Lotus corniculatus on four proteolytic rumen bacteria in sheep during and after transition from a ryegrass (Lolium perenne)-white clover (Trifolium repens) diet (i.e., low condensed tannins) to a Lotus corniculatus diet (i.e., higher condensed tannins). The bacterial populations were quantified using a competitive polymerase chain reaction. Lotus corniculatus was fed with or without ruminal infusions of polyethylene glycol (PEG), which binds to and inactivates condensed tannins, enabling the effect of condensed tannins on bacterial populations to be examined. When sheep fed on ryegrass-white clover, populations of Clostridium proteoclasticum B316T, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens C211a, Eubacterium sp. C12b, and Streptococcus bovis B315 were 1.5 x 10(8), 1.1 x 10(6), 4.6 x 10(8), and 7.1 x 10(6) mL(-1), respectively. When the diet was changed to Lotus corniculatus, the average populations (after 8-120 h) of C. proteoclasticum, B. fibrisolvens, Eubacterium sp., and S. bovis decreased (P < 0.001) to 2.4 x 10(7), 1.1 x 10(5), 1.1 x 10(8), and 2.5 x 10(5) mL(-1), respectively. When PEG was infused into the rumen of sheep fed Lotus corniculatus, the populations of C. proteoclasticum, B. fibrisolvens, Eubacterium sp., and S. bovis were higher (P < 0.01-0.001) than in sheep fed Lotus corniculatus without the PEG infusion, with average populations (after 8-120 h) of 4.9 x 10(7), 3.8 x 10(5), 1.9 x 10(8), and 1.0 x 10(6), respectively. Sheep fed the Lotus corniculatus diet had lower rumen proteinase activity, ammonia, and soluble nitrogen (P < 0.05-0.001) than sheep that were fed Lotus corniculatus plus PEG. The Lotus corniculatus diet reduced rumen nitrogen digestibility (P < 0.05) and ammonia pool size and increased the flow of undegraded feed nitrogen to the abomasum. The nitrogen intake, rumen non-ammonia nitrogen pool size, rumen microbial non-ammonia nitrogen pool size, and abomasal microbial non-ammonia nitrogen fluxes were similar both in sheep fed only Lotus corniculatus and in sheep fed Lotus corniculatus plus PEG, but nonmicrobial non-ammonia nitrogen flux to the abomasum was higher (P < 0.01) for the sheep fed only Lotus corniculatus. Although condensed tannins in Lotus corniculatus reduced the populations of some proteolytic bacteria, total ruminal microbial protein and microbial protein outflow to the abomasum were unchanged, suggesting a species-specific effect of condensed tannins on bacteria in the rumen.
TI  - Infected left atrial myxoma.
AB  - A 47-year-old Japanese woman with a continuing high fever was promptly diagnosed  as having infected atrial myxoma one day after admission based on transthoracic echocardiographic findings and positivity for bacteria in blood culture. The mass was removed by an urgent open heart surgery. Histopathological examination confirmed that this mass was a myxoma with gram-positive bacterial colonies. Generally, antemortem diagnosis is difficult and there is a high mortality of patients with infected myxoma; however, this patient completely recovered from the illness because of the prompt diagnosis. This is the 37th case of definite infected myxoma reported in the literature. The cause of infection of this patient might have been the acupuncture therapy she underwent for weight reduction.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis bacteremia from a venous access port in a patient with AIDS.
AB  - We report the first case of S. bovis bacteremia related to endoluminal colonization of a venous access port in a setting of advanced HIV infection, neutropenia and co-infection with HBV. The patient had no bowel abnormalities. The clinical picture was mild and was resolved by removal of the device.
TI  - The binding and degradation of nisin by mixed ruminal bacteria.
AB  - We found that nisin catalyzed potassium efflux from glycolyzing Streptococcus bovis JB1 cell suspensions and that the steady state concentration of residual potassium was dependent upon the amount of nisin added. The relationship between nisin concentration and potassium depletion was a saturation function that had considerable cooperativity. By pre-incubating mixed ruminal bacteria with nisin and removing them prior to S. bovis JB1 addition, it was possible to estimate the ability of mixed ruminal bacteria to bind or degrade nisin. Low concentrations of mixed ruminal bacteria did not bind or degrade all of the nisin in 6 h, but little nisin remained if the mixed ruminal bacteria were present at more than 50 microg protein ml(-1). Because cell-free ruminal fluid (10% v/v) inactivated the nisin in less than 2 h, and this inactivation could be counteracted by autoclaving, ultra-filtration or proteinase inhibitor, it appeared that there was an enzymatic degradation of nisin. Mixed ruminal bacteria degraded nisin rapidly, but this degradation did not prevent potassium depletion from mixed ruminal bacteria. These latter results indicated that nisin binding was faster than nisin degradation. The idea that nisin binding could protect nisin from degradation was supported by the observation that intact nisin could be extracted from mixed ruminal bacteria. These observations support the hypothesis that bacteriocins can be used to modify ruminal fermentation, but further work will be needed to see if these peptides can be produced economically.
TI  - The effect of bovicin HC5, a bacteriocin from Streptococcus bovis HC5, on ruminal methane production in vitro.
AB  - Methane represents a loss of feed energy to ruminant animals, and nutritionists have sought methods of inhibiting ruminal methane production. When mixed ruminal bacteria (approximately 400 mg protein ml(-1)) from a cow fed timothy hay were incubated in vitro with carbon dioxide and hydrogen (0.5 atm) for less than 8 h, the first-order rate of methane production was 17 micromol ml(-1). Semi-purified bacteriocin from Streptococcus bovis HC5 (bovicin HC5) inhibited methane production, by as much as 50%, and even a low concentration of bovicin HC5 (128 activity units (AU) ml(-1)) caused a significant decrease. Mixed ruminal bacteria that were transferred successively retained their ability to produce methane from carbon dioxide and hydrogen, and the first-order rate of methane production did not decrease. Cultures that were treated with bovicin HC5 (128 AU ml(-1)) gradually lost their ability to produce methane, and methane was not detected after four transfers. These latter results indicated that ruminal methanogens could not adapt and become resistant to bovicin HC5. When the chromosomal DNA was amplified with 16S rDNA primers specific to archaea, digested with restriction enzymes (HhaI and HaeIII) and separated on agarose gels, approximately 12 fragments were observed. DNA from control and treated cultures (third transfer) had the same fragment pattern indicating bovicin HC5 was not selective. Given the perception that the routine use of antibiotics in animal feeds should be avoided, bacteriocins may provide an alternative strategy for decreasing ruminal methane production.
TI  - Effects of pneumoperitoneum on hemodynamic and systemic immunologic responses to  peritonitis in pigs.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Experimental evidence supporting the safety of laparoscopic intervention during sepsis is limited. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of pneumoperitoneum on immunologic and hemodynamic responses to peritoneal sepsis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A porcine model of peritonitis was created using an intraperitoneal autologous fecal inoculum. Pigs were then subjected to one of four procedures 24 h postinoculation (n = 6 per group): laparotomy, CO(2) laparoscopy, helium laparoscopy, and anesthesia only (1.5% isoflurane in 100% O(2), mechanical ventilation). Venous blood samples were obtained prior to inoculation, and at 24 (prior to procedure), 30, 48, 72, and 96 h postinoculation to determine white blood count (WBC) with differential, C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor, and bacteremia. Heart rate, end-tidal CO(2) (ETCO(2)), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), and arterial blood gas variables were also measured at baseline and every 30 min throughout the procedure. RESULTS: Postoperative blood cultures confirmed systemic bacteremia in all groups at all time periods postinoculation. Following inoculation, WBC, band cell count, and CRP remained elevated above baseline in all groups throughout the study (P < 0.01). However, no significant differences in these parameters were observed among groups. In the CO(2) laparoscopy group, MAP, ETCO(2), and arterial pCO(2) were increased above baseline, while pH was decreased throughout the procedure (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In this animal model of peritonitis, CO(2) pneumoperitoneum induced hypercapnia, acidemia, and systemic hypertension intraoperatively, without a discernable effect on systemic immune function.

AB  
TI  - Factors affecting the antibacterial activity of the ruminal bacterium, Streptococcus bovis HC5.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis HC5 inhibits a variety of S. bovis strains and other Gram-positive bacteria, but factors affecting this activity had not been defined. Batch culture studies indicated that S. bovis HC5 did not inhibit S. bovis JB1 (a non-bacteriocin-producing strain) until glucose was depleted and cells were entering stationary phase, but slow-dilution-rate, continuous cultures (0.2 h(-1)) had as much antibacterial activity as stationary-phase batch cultures. Because the activity of continuous cultures (0.2-1.2 h(-1)) was inversely related to the glucose consumption rate, it appeared that the antibacterial activity was being catabolite repressed by glucose. When the pH of continuous cultures (0.2 h(-1)) was decreased from 6.7 to 5.4, antibacterial activity doubled, but this activity declined at pH values less than 5.0. Continuous cultures (0.2 h(-1)) that had only ammonia as a nitrogen source had antibacterial activity, and large amounts of Trypticase (10 mg ml(-1)) caused only a 2.0-fold decline in the amount of HC5 cell-associated protein that was needed to prevent S. bovis JB1 growth. Because S. bovis HC5 was able to produce antibacterial activity over a wide range of culture conditions, there is an increased likelihood that this activity could have commercial application.
TI  - Bovicin HC5, a bacteriocin from Streptococcus bovis HC5.
AB  - Previous work indicated that Streptococcus bovis HC5 had significant antibacterial activity, and even nisin-resistant S. bovis JB1 cells could be strongly inhibited. S. bovis HC5 inhibited a variety of Gram-positive bacteria and the spectrum of activity was similar to monensin, a commonly used feed additive. The crude extracts (ammonium sulfate precipitation) were inactivated by Pronase E and trypsin, but the activity was resistant to heat, proteinase K and alpha-chymotrypsin. Most of the antibacterial activity was cell associated, but it could be liberated by acidic NaCl (100 mM, pH 2.0) without significant cell lysis. When glycolysing S. bovis JB1 cells were treated with either crude or acidic NaCl extracts, intracellular potassium declined and this result indicated the antibacterial activity was mediated by a pore-forming peptide. The peptide could be purified by HPLC and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis indicated that it had a molecular mass of approximately 2440 Da. The terminal amino acid sequence was VGXRYASXPGXSWKYVXF. The unnamed amino acid residues (designated by X) had approximately the same position as dehydroalanines found in some lantibiotics, but samples that were reduced and alkylated prior to Edman degradation did not have cysteine residues. The only other bacteriocin that had significant similarity was the lantibiotic precursor of Streptococcus pyogenes SF370, but the identity was only 55%. Based on these results, the bacteriocin of S. bovis HC5 appears to be novel and the authors now designate it as bovicin HC5.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis bacteremia and fetal death.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preterm premature rupture of membranes leading to intraamniotic infection and fetal death may be due to unusual bacterial species. CASE: A young multipara presented at 24 weeks and 6 days' gestation with rupture of membranes of 2 days' duration. She was febrile and hypotensive. No fetal heart activity was noted. Antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and oxytocin were begun with delivery of a 798-g stillborn fetus. Maternal and fetal cultures demonstrated Streptococcus bovis as the infectious agent. CONCLUSION: Unusual bacteria such as S bovis are sometimes responsible for severe maternal and fetal infections. Aggressive fluid resuscitation, uterine evacuation, and triple antibiotic therapy until culture results are available are indicated.

TI  - What happened to the streptococci: overview of taxonomic and nomenclature changes.
AB  - Since the division of the Streptococcus genus into enterococci, lactococci, and streptococci in 1984, many changes in the nomenclature and taxonomy of the Streptococcus genus have taken place. The application of genetic comparisons has improved the proper classification of the different species. The Lancefield system of serogrouping the streptococci by the expression of beta-hemolysis on blood agar plates is still very useful for the identification of streptococci for patient management. The Lancefield grouping system cannot be used in itself for accurate identification of specific beta-hemolytic species, but it can be a useful part of the identification procedure. Except for identification of the "Streptococcus bovis group" of species and Streptococcus suis, Lancefield grouping is of little value in identification of the non-beta-hemolytic streptococci and related genera. In fact, identification of the non-beta-hemolytic species is problematic for conventional as well as commercially available identification procedures. A combination of conventional tests and specific chromogenic tests suggested by several investigators is presented and discussed. Tables are included that suggest tests and procedures to guide investigators attempting to identify all the species.
TI  - Are ruminal bacteria protected against environmental stress by plant antioxidants?
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the activity response of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide  dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) of the rumen bacterium Streptococcus bovis following exposure to mercury(II) chloride (HgCl(2) in the presence of plant antioxidants. METHODS AND RESULTS: Streptococcus bovis was grown with 0 or 5 microg ml(-1) of HgCl(2) alone or together with antioxidant substances (AOS): seleno-l-methionine (Se), alpha-tocopherol (alpha toc), beta-carotene (beta car), melatonin (mel). The activities of SOD and GHPx were estimated in supernatants of disrupted bacterial cells. A significant decrease in the Strep. bovis SOD activity in the presence of HgCl(2) and tested AOS, except mel, was observed. The GSHPx activity of Strep. bovis was under the same cultivation conditions nonsignificantly changed and a significant decrease in the GSHPx activity was recorded only in the presence of beta car. CONCLUSIONS: The positive effect of Se, alpha toc and beta car on the elimination of environmental stress, evoked by mercury, in ruminal bacterium Strep. bovis in vitro was documented. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The potential role of plant antioxidants in elimination of the environmental stress of ruminal bacteria evoked by heavy metals is discussed.
TI  - Reevaluation of Streptococcus bovis endocarditis cases from 1975 to 1985 by 16S ribosomal DNA sequence analysis.
AB  - Studies that detected an association between Streptococcus bovis endocarditis and colon carcinoma have not taken into account the recently identified genetic diversity among organisms historically classified as S. bovis. With near full-length 16S ribosomal DNA sequence analysis, organisms cultured from the blood of endocarditis patients at the Mayo Clinic from 1975 to 1985 and previously identified as S. bovis or streptococcus group D nonenterococci were shown to represent S. bovis biotypes I (11 isolates) and II/2 (1 isolate), S. salivarius (1 isolate), and S. macedonicus (1 isolate). Two of the S. bovis biotype I cases were associated with colon cancer. Whether S. bovis biotype II or other organisms closely related to and historically identified as S. bovis (e.g., S. macedonicus) are associated with malignant (or premalignant) colon lesions in humans remains to be definitively determined.
TI  - Video-assisted cardioscopy for infectious endocarditis.
AB  - We successfully resected vegetation of infectious endocarditis in right ventricular outflow tract using a video-assisted cardioscopy without ventriculotomy. Video-assisted cardioscopy provided clear and precise visualization of vegetation on the anterior wall of right ventricular outflow. This technique is effective to visualize remote intra-cardiac structures, and to facilitate repairs, while avoiding the need for extended cardiac incisions.
TI  - groESL sequence determination, phylogenetic analysis, and species differentiation for viridans group streptococci.
AB  - The full-length sequences of the groESL genes (also known as cpn10/60) of Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus sanguis and the near full-length sequence of the groESL genes of Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus salivarius were determined. The lengths of the groES genes from the 10 species listed above ranged from 282 to 288 bp, and the full-length sequences of groEL determined for 4 species (S. anginosus, S. constellatus, S. gordonii, and S. sanguis) revealed that each was 1,623 bp. The intergenic region (spacer) between the groES and groEL genes varies in size (15 to 111 bp) and sequence between species. The variation of the groES sequences among the species tested was greater (62.1 to 95.1% nucleotide sequence identities) than that of the groEL sequences (77.2 to 95.2% nucleotide sequence identities). Phylogenetic analysis of the groES and groEL genes yielded evolutionary trees similar to the tree constructed by use of the 16S rRNA gene. The intraspecies variation of the spacer was minimal for clinical isolates of some species. The groESL sequence data provide an additional parameter for identification of viridans group streptococcal species.
TI  - Cholesterol assimilation by lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria isolated from the human gut.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of human gut-derived lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria on cholesterol levels in vitro. Continuous cultures inoculated with fecal material from healthy human volunteers with media supplemented with cholesterol and bile acids were used to enrich for potential cholesterol assimilators among the indigenous bacterial populations. Seven potential probiotics were found: Lactobacillus fermentum strains F53 and KC5b, Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC 15697, Streptococcus bovis ATCC 43143, Enterococcus durans DSM 20633, Enterococcus gallinarum, and Enterococcus faecalis. A comparative evaluation regarding the in vitro cholesterol reduction abilities of these strains along with commercial probiotics was undertaken. The degree of acid and bile tolerance of strains was also evaluated. The human isolate L. fermentum KC5b was able to maintain viability for 2 h at pH 2 and to grow in a medium with 4,000 mg of bile acids per liter. This strain was also able to remove a maximum of 14.8 mg of cholesterol per g (dry weight) of cells from the culture medium and therefore was regarded as a candidate probiotic.
TI  - Quarter milk somatic cell count in infected dairy cows: a meta-analysis.
AB  - The aim of this paper was to evaluate the effects associated with intramammary infection (IMI) by a bacterium or a group of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, coliforms, Staphylococci other than S. aureus, and Corynebacterium bovis) on the somatic cell count (SCC) in quarter milk of dairy cows. Papers selected for analysis had to provide SCC values associated with the natural infection in quarters by different bacteria. Sampling for measurement of SCC and determination of the infection had to be done on the same day. Only papers published in English or in French after 1971 were considered. Twenty-one papers fulfilled the selection criteria. The animals sampled, the measurement techniques for SCC and the bacteriological identification, as well as the definition of the infection, all differed widely among the selected studies. The meta-analysis method was used to estimate both the mean SCC (arithmetic and geometric) value and the average increase on SCC of each type of infection. The geometric mean SCC in bacteriologically negative quarters was 68 000 c/mL. In case of IMI, the retained SCC was 357 000, 857 000, 547 000, 1 024 000, 1 151 000, 138 000 and 105 000 c/mL in quarters infected by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, coliforms, staphylococci other than S. aureus and Corynebacterium bovis, respectively. The variation factors that could influence these SCC values and the bacteriological results are discussed.
TI  - Characterization of a bacteriocin produced by a newly isolated Bacillus sp. Strain 8 A.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this research was to investigate the production of bacteriocins  by Bacillus spp. isolated from native soils of south of Brazil. METHODS AND RESULTS: A bacteriocin produced by the bacterium Bacillus cereus 8 A was identified. The antimicrobial activity was produced starting at the exponential growth phase, although maximum activity was at stationary growth phase. A crude bacteriocin obtained from culture supernatant fluid was inhibitory to a broad range of indicator strains, including Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, and several species of Bacillus. Clinically relevant bacteria such as Streptococcus bovis and Micrococcus luteus were also inhibited. Bacteriocin was stable at 80 degrees C, but the activity was lost when the temperature reached 87 degrees C. It was resistant to the proteolytic action of trypsin and papain, but sensitive to proteinase K and pronase E. Bacteriocin activity was observed in the pH range of 6.0-9.0. CONCLUSIONS: A bacteriocin produced by Bacillus cereus 8 A was characterized, presenting a broad spectrum of activity and potential for use as biopreservative in food. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: The identification of a bacteriocin with large activity spectrum, including pathogens and spoilage microorganisms, addresses an important aspect of food safety.
TI  - Effects of bacterial direct-fed microbials on ruminal fermentation, blood variables, and the microbial populations of feedlot cattle.
AB  - A study was conducted to determine whether bacterial direct-fed microbials (DFM)  could be used to minimize the risk of acidosis in feedlot cattle receiving high concentrate diets. Six ruminally cannulated steers, previously adapted to a high concentrate diet, were used in a double 3 x 3 Latin square to study the effects of DFM on feed intake, ruminal pH, and ruminal and blood characteristics. Steers were provided ad libitum access to a diet containing steam-rolled barley, barley silage, and a protein-mineral supplement at 87, 9, and 4% (DM basis), respectively. Treatments were as follows: control, Propionibacterium P15 (P15), and Propionibacterium P15 and Enterococcus faecium EF212 (PE). The bacterial treatments (10(9) cfu/g) plus whey powder carrier, or whey powder alone for control, were top-dressed once daily at the time of feeding (10 g/[steer/d]). Periods consisted of 2 wk of adaptation and 1 wk of measurements. Ruminal pH was continuously measured for 6 d using indwelling electrodes. Dry matter intake and ruminal pH (mean, minimum, hours, and area pH < 5.8 or < 5.5) were not affected by treatment (P > 0.05). However, supplementation with P15 increased protozoal numbers (P < 0.05) with a concomitant increase in ruminal NH3 concentration (P < 0.01) and a decrease in the number of amylolytic bacteria (P < 0.05) compared with the control. Streptococcus bovis, enumerated using a selective medium, was numerically reduced with supplementation of PE. Although blood pH and blood glucose were not affected by DFM supplementation, steers fed PE had numerically lower concentrations of blood CO2 than control steers, which is consistent with a reduced risk of metabolic acidosis. Although the bacterial DFM used in this study did not induce changes in DMI or ruminal and blood pH, some rumen and blood variables indicated that the bacterial DFM used in this study may decrease the risk of acidosis in feedlot cattle.
TI  - Identification of Streptococcus bovis biotype I strains among S. bovis clinical isolates by PCR.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis causes 24% of all streptococcal infective endocarditis cases. There are many reports linking both S. bovis bacteremia and endocarditis with various forms of gastrointestinal disease (primarily colonic cancers). S. bovis is divided into two biotypes: I and II. The biotype I strain is much more frequently isolated from patients with endocarditis, gastrointestinal disease, or both. We describe here the isolation of biotype I-specific DNA sequences and the development of a PCR test which can identify S. bovis biotype I strains among S. bovis clinical isolates.
TI  - Taxonomic dissection of the Streptococcus bovis group by analysis of manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase gene (sodA) sequences: reclassification of 'Streptococcus infantarius subsp. coli' as Streptococcus lutetiensis sp. nov. and of Streptococcus bovis biotype 11.2 as Streptococcus pasteurianus sp. nov.
AB  - The taxonomic dissection of the Streptococcus bovis-Streptococcus equinus group was carried out upon obtaining sequences for the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase gene (sodA) of the type strains of S. bovis, Streptococcus caprinus, S. equinus, Streptococcus gallolyticus, Streptococcus infantarius, Streptococcus macedonicus and Streptococcus waius. The sodA sequences of 29 streptococcal strains of animal and human origin that were related to S. bovis were also sequenced. A phylogenetic analysis of the sodA sequences revealed that the S. bovis-S. equinus group comprises five different clusters that correspond to five distinct species. The type strains of S. bovis and S. equinus were associated in the same cluster, corresponding to the species S. equinus. The type strains of S. caprinus, S. gallolyticus, S. macedonicus and S. waius were associated in the same cluster, which defined a single species containing S. gallolyticus and its junior synonym S. caprinus, and S. macedonicus and its junior synonym S. waius. The two subspecies thought to constitute the species S. infantarius, namely S. infantarius subsp. infantarius and 'S. infantarius subsp. coli', were located in two distinct clusters. One of these clusters defined the species S. infantarius and included the type strain of S. infantarius subsp. infantarius. The other cluster defined 'S. infantarius subsp. coli', leading to the proposal of its reclassification as the novel species Streptococcus lutetiensis (NEM 782T = CIP 106849T). The remaining cluster comprised all of the strains previously identified as belonging to S. bovis biotype 11.2, leading to the proposal to reassign these strains to the novel species Streptococcus pasteurianus (NEM 1202T = CIP 107122T). The results of the phylogenetic analysis were confirmed by DNA-DNA hybridization experiments, thus demonstrating that sequence databases of defined DNA targets, such as sodA, may constitute a valuable alternative approach for modern bacterial systematics.
TI  - [Streptococcus bovis meningitis. An infrequent cause of bacterial meningitis in the adult patient].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bacterial meningitis in adult patients, produced by streptococci other than Streptococcus pneumoniae, is not common. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 74 year old male patient with meningitis and endocarditis due to Streptococcus bovis (group D, not enterococcus), sensitive to penicillin (CMI< 0.1 mg/L), with no characteristic clinical or analytical discoveries. A gastrointestinal exploration revealed only diverticles in the colon and two lesions compatible with splenic infarction, observed by using computerised axial tomography of the abdomen. The patient responded favourably to a four week course of antibiotics; he remained asymptomatic, afebrile and culture negative after the therapy was stopped. CONCLUSIONS: In many previously reported cases, there is an association with gastrointestinal illness, endocarditis or oral lesions. Gram staining of the cerebrospinal fluid is usually negative and the neurological signs are often subtle. In the case of bacteraemia, endocarditis or S. bovis meningitis, the presence of an underlying pathology of the colon due to the frequent association between these processes must be ruled out. Treatment with penicillin G is usually sufficient.
TI  - The bacteriocins of ruminal bacteria and their potential as an alternative to antibiotics.
AB  - Beef cattle have been fed ionophores and other antibiotics for more than 20 years to decrease ruminal fermentation losses (e.g methane and ammonia) and increase feed efficiency, and these improvements have been explained by an inhibition of gram-positive ruminal bacteria. Ionophores are not used to treat human disease, but there has been an increased perception that antibiotics should not be used as feed additives. Some bacteria produce small peptides (bacteriocins) that inhibit gram-positive bacteria. In vitro experiments indicated that the bacteriocin, nisin, and the ionophore, monensin, had similar effects on ruminal fermentation. However, preliminary results indicated that mixed ruminal bacteria degraded nisin, and the ruminal bacterium, Streptococcus bovis, became highly nisin-resistant. A variety of ruminal bacteria produce bacteriocins, and bacteriocin production has, in some cases, been correlated with changes in ruminal ecology. Some ruminal bacteriocins are as potent as nisin in vitro, and resistance can be circumvented. Based on these results, ruminal bacteriocins may provide an alternative to antibiotics in cattle rations.

TI  - Fermentation of pectin and glucose, and activity of pectin-degrading enzymes in the rabbit caecal bacterium Bifidobacterium pseudolongum.
AB  - AIMS: In a rabbit caecal bacterium Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, metabolites of pectin and glucose, and activities of enzymes involved in the degradation of pectin were assayed. Simultaneously, activities of these enzymes were assayed in a rumen pectinolytic strain of Streptococcus bovis. METHODS AND RESULTS: A strain B. pseudolongum P6 which grew best on pectin was selected among bifidobacteria isolated from the rabbit caecum. Cultures of B. pseudolongum P6 grown on pectin produced significantly less formate, lactate and ethanol, and more acetate and succinate than cultures grown on glucose. No CO2 production on pectin was observed. Pectin macromolecule was degraded by extracellular pectinase (EC 3.2.1.15). Cell extracts possessed the activity of 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDPG) aldolase (EC 4.1.2.14). Streptococcus bovis X4, possessed activity of exopectate lyase and pectinase, but not that of KDPG aldolase. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are consistent with the assumption that in B. pseudolongum P6 acidic products of pectin degradation are catabolized via a modified Entner-Doudoroff pathway, as shown previously in rumen pectin-utilizing bacteria. The missing KDPG aldolase activity in Strep. bovis X4 seems to be the reason for the absence of growth of this bacterium on pectin. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Information on polysaccharide metabolism in bifidobacteria is fragmentary. This study extends the knowledge on pectin metabolism in intestinal bacteria.
TI  - Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis caused by Streptococcus bovis: case series and  review of the literature.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis is the rare cause of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in decompensated cirrhosis. S. bovis bacteremia has long been known to be associated with colon cancer. We describe seven patients and review the seven previous reports of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis patients with S. bovis infection. Most of the patients had cirrhosis and presented with fever, abdominal pain, abdominal distention, and jaundice. Colonic adenomatous polyps with dysplastic change were found in 18.2% of the patients. The approach to this group of patients requires diagnostic paracentesis, blood cultures, ascitic fluid culture, and treatment with antimicrobial agents. Intravenous penicillin is still the antimicrobial agent of first choice (mean minimum inhibitory concentration for penicillin = 0.05 microg/ml). S. bovis is an infrequent cause of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The physician could make a case that colonoscopy is not needed because the patient is very sick and the possibility of GI pathology, especially colonic lesions, has been low. However, it may be that colonoscopy should be done if there are clinical suggestions to do so or the patient is well enough to withstand surgery.
TI  - Special issues in the management of infective endocarditis caused by gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Gram-positive cocci, mainly streptococci and staphylococci, continue to cause the majority of cases of infective endocarditis. Among the streptococci causing IE, the long-standing predominance of oral or viridans-group streptococci has progressively faded, while the number of cases caused by "enteric streptococci" (Streptococcus bovis and enterococci) has increased. While most oral streptococci and S. bovis strains remain fully sensitive to penicillin, nutritionally variant streptococci--now renamed Abiotrophia--and enterococci can exhibit resistance to penicillin and/or glycopeptides that makes endocarditis more difficult to treat. Among the staphylococci causing endocarditis, the increasing proportion of coagulase-negative and methicillin-resistant strains observed in recent years has changed the approach to choice of antibiotic therapy. The purpose of this paper is to focus on some new aspects of the management of antibiotic therapy of IE due to streptococci and staphylococci, including recent developments such as once-daily aminoglycoside administration in IE, outpatient antibiotic therapy, and the evaluation of new antibiotics.
TI  - Source of enterococci in a farmhouse raw-milk cheese.
AB  - Enterococci are widely distributed in raw-milk cheeses and are generally thought  to positively affect flavor development. Their natural habitats are the human and animal intestinal tracts, but they are also found in soil, on plants, and in the intestines of insects and birds. The source of enterococci in raw-milk cheese is unknown. In the present study, an epidemiological approach with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to type 646 Enterococcus strains which were isolated from a Cheddar-type cheese, the milk it was made from, the feces of cows and humans associated with the cheese-making unit, and the environment, including the milking equipment, the water used on the farm, and the cows' teats. Nine different PFGE patterns, three of Enterococcus casseliflavus, five of Enterococcus faecalis, and one of Enterococcus durans, were found. The same three clones, one of E. faecalis and two of E. casseliflavus, dominated almost all of the milk, cheese, and human fecal samples. The two E. casseliflavus clones were also found in the bulk tank and the milking machine even after chlorination, suggesting that a niche where enterococci could grow was present and that contamination with enterococci begins with the milking equipment. It is likely but unproven that the enterococci present in the human feces are due to consumption of the cheese. Cow feces were not considered the source of enterococci in the cheese, as Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus bovis, which largely dominated the cows' intestinal tracts, were not found in either the milk or the cheese.
TI  - Molecular characterization and expression of pyruvate formate-lyase-activating enzyme in a ruminal bacterium, Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - To clarify the significance of the activation of pyruvate formate-lyase (PFL) by  PFL-activating enzyme (PFL-AE) in Streptococcus bovis, the molecular properties and gene expression of PFL-AE were investigated. S. bovis PFL-AE was deduced to consist of 261 amino acids with a molecular mass of 29.9 kDa and appeared to be a monomer protein. Similar to Escherichia coli PFL-AE, S. bovis PFL-AE required Fe(2+) for activity. The gene encoding PFL-AE (act) was found to be polycistronic, and the PFL gene (pfl) was not included. However, the act mRNA level changed in parallel with the pfl mRNA level, responding to growth conditions, and the change was contrary to the change in the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) mRNA level. PFL-AE synthesis appeared to change in parallel with PFL synthesis. Introduction of a recombinant plasmid containing S. bovis pfl and the pfl promoter into S. bovis did not affect formate and lactate production, which suggests that the activity of the pfl promoter is low. When the pfl promoter was replaced by the S. bovis ldh promoter, PFL was overexpressed, which caused an increase in the formate-to-lactate ratio. However, when PFL-AE was overexpressed, the formate-to-lactate ratio did not change, suggesting that PFL-AE was present at a level that was high enough to activate PFL. When both PFL-AE and PFL were overexpressed, the formate-to-lactate ratio further increased. It is conceivable that LDH activity is much higher than PFL activity, which may explain why the formate-to-lactate ratio is usually low.
TI  - Study of the intra- and interlaboratory reproducibility of partial single base C-sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and its applicability for the identification of members of the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - The use of Single Base C-Sequencing of the first 500 bases of the 16S rRNA-gene (SBCS) combined with capillary electrophoresis was evaluated for the identification of reference strains of 30 different species within the genus Streptococcus. For SBCS, only dd-CTP's are used in the sequencing reactions instead of the four dideoxy bases and the primer is fluorescently labeled. The reproducibility, interlaboratory exchangeability and discriminative power of this method were studied by comparing the patterns obtained in three laboratories under highly standardized conditions. The interlaboratory reproducibility proved to be high, enabling the construction of a common database for the identification of strains belonging to the streptococcal species studied. Most of the examined species generated distinguishable profiles. SBCS did not differentiate between the closely related species S. constellatus and S. intermedius. Also S. thermophilus and S. vestibularis as well as S. mitis and S. pneumoniae showed highly resembling profiles. The previously reported heterogeneity within the species S. equinus was reflected by SBCS. For all other species, strains belonging to the same species generated indistinguishable patterns. In conclusion, Single Base C-sequencing of the first 500 bases of the 16S rRNA-gene could be a useful and widely applicable method for the identification of bacteria at the species level, with the added advantage of being more rapid and easier to automatize than full sequence determination.

AB  
TI  - Comparison between Streptococcus macedonicus and Streptococcus waius strains and  reclassification of Streptococcus waius (Flint et at. 1999) as Streptococcus macedonicus (Tsakalidou et al. 1998).
AB  - Two species of dairy streptococci, Streptococcus waius and Streptococcus macedonicus, were originally characterized by 16S-23S intergenic spacer sequence analysis, random amplified polymorphic DNA fingerprinting, PFGE analysis and DNA-DNA reassociation experiments. All genetic data suggested that S. waius strains belong to the previously described species S. macedonicus. Likewise, the phenotypic characterization showed that strains of S. macedonicus and S. waius were highly related and easily differentiated from the closest phylogenetic neighbour, Streptococcus bovis, principally by their failure to produce a blackening reaction in medium containing aesculin. The utilization of maltose and cellobiose by S. macedonicus/S. waius strains allowed their differentiation from the most studied dairy species, Streptococcus thermophilus. On the basis of genetic and phenotypic data S. macedonicus and S. waius species should be considered synonyms and S. macedonicus has the priority.
TI  - Isolation from a shea cake digester of a tannin-degrading Streptococcus gallolyticus strain that decarboxylates protocatechuic and hydroxycinnamic acids, and emendation of the species.
AB  - A facultatively anaerobic, mesophilic, non-motile, non-sporulating bacterium, designated strain B7, was isolated from an anaerobic digester fed with shea cake rich in tannins and aromatic compounds, after enrichment on tannic acid. The coccoid cells (less than 2 microm in diameter) occurred in pairs or short chains and stained gram-positive. Strain B7 fermented a wide range of carbohydrates (cellobiose, fructose, galactose, glucose, lactose, maltose, mannitol, melibiose, raffinose and trehalose), grew optimally at pH 7.0 and had a G+C content of 40.4+/-0.3 mol%. Strain B7 was closely related to Streptococcus gallolyticus ACM 3611T, a member of the Streptococcus bovis rRNA cluster, with a sequence similarity of 98% and a DNA hybridization value of 86 mol%. Isolate B7 hydrolysed tannic acid and decarboxylated gallic acid to pyrogallol, traits also observed in S. gallolyticus ACM 3611T. In addition, both strains decarboxylated protocatechuic acid to catechol, p-coumaric acid to 4-vinylphenol, caffeic acid to 4-vinylcatechol and ferulic acid to 4-vinylguaiacol. An unsubstituted para-hydroxyl group on the benzene ring was required for decarboxylation. Glucose addition markedly increased the conversion rate. As these traits were not described previously, emendation of the description of the species Streptococcus gallolyticus is proposed.
TI  - Effects of exogenous ammonia or free amino acids on proteolytic activity and protein breakdown products in Streptococcus bovis, Prevotella albensis, and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens.
AB  - We studied in details the ammonia or free amino acids (AA) effects on proteolytic activity of three ruminal bacteria: enzymatic activities and protein breakdown products were measured at the end of the exponential growth phase. In Streptococcus bovis the simultaneous uptake of ammonia and probably small peptides induced a decline in total proteolytic activity as a result of changes in endopeptidasic activities. With free AA, the tendency for the endopeptidasic activities to specialise was more evident and the total proteolytic activity decreased too. In Prevotella albensis, the inhibition of proteolysis with free AA was linked to the disappearance of free endopeptidases, to the specialization of cell-associated endopeptidases and to the decrease in exopeptidases. The decrease of proteolysis in P. albensis when ammonia was added was more difficult to interpret. With ammonia or AA Butyrivibro fibrisolvens developed a distinct behavior of those expressed by the other species: the increase of the total proteolytic activity could be explained by a better balance of the endopeptidases expressed. It then clearly appeared that the expression of the proteolytic activities are linked to the nature and/or to the quantity of the nitrogen source. This leads each species to adopt its own nutritional strategy in order to adapt to the environmental conditions of the ruminal ecosystem.
TI  - Development and application of quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay based on the ABI 7700 system (TaqMan) for detection and quantification of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis.
AB  - Numerous reports have described diagnostic methods based on the polymerase chain  reaction (PCR) used to detect Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, the causative agent of Johne's disease. The result of conventional PCR tests has been only qualitative, either positive or negative; it does not present any quantitative information about the number of the agents in the specimen. A quantitative PCR method (IS900 TaqMan) was developed to measure the number of M. a. paratuberculosis organisms present in field and clinical samples. The sensitivity of IS900 TaqMan was 1 colony-forming unit (CFU) for M. a. paratuberculosis ATCC 19698. The specificity of the method was determined by testing 14 mycobacterial species (M. abscessus, M. asiaticum, M. avium subsp. avium, M. bovis, M. fortuitum subsp. fortuitum, M. intracellulare, M. kansasii, M. marinum, M. phlei, M. scrofulaceum, M. simiae, M. smegmatis, M. terrae, and M. ulcerans) and 9 nonmycobacterial species (Borrelia burgdorferi, Chlamydia psittaci, Ehrlichia canis, E. equi, E. risticii, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Streptococcus equi, and S. zooepidemicus). Even at high cell numbers (10(5) CFU/reaction), most of the organisms tested negative for the IS900 insertion element except M. marinum and M. scrofulaceum. This finding for M. scrofulaceum was consistent with previous reports that several M. scrofulaceum-like isolates were positive for IS900. Those isolates had 71-79% homology with M. a. paratuberculosis in the region of IS900. When used in conjunction with the new liquid medium-based ESP culture system II for bovine clinical fecal samples, IS900 TaqMan confirmed that the ESP II-positive samples contained 10(5)-10(6) CFU/ml of M. a. paratuberculosis. All of the 222 ESP II-positive and acid-fast bacilli-positive samples tested in this study were positive by IS900 TaqMan. IS900 TaqMan was also useful in the study of growth characteristics of 3 groups of M. a. paratuberculosis strains in bovine fecal samples from 3 shedding levels (heavy, medium, and low) based on cell numbers measured by Herrold egg yolk (HEY) agar culture. When cultured in ESP medium, M. a. paratuberculosis reached 10(5)-10(6) CFU/ml within 2 weeks for heavy shedders, 3-4 weeks for medium, and 6-8 weeks for low shedders. No significant growth was observed after up to 5 weeks of incubation for some of low shedders. No or extremely slow growth characteristic of low shedders might be a possible explanation for frequent false-negative results by HEY. The detection time was dependent on the inoculum size and the growth rate of M. a. paratuberculosis. Generation times were inversely proportional to the shedding level: 1-2 days for medium and heavy shedders and >4 days for low shedders. IS900 TaqMan could be a useful tool for determining viable cell counts by measuring changes in cell numbers over the incubation period.
TI  - Successful treatment of a ruptured mycotic aneurysm of the ileocolic artery with  transcatheter embolization and antibiotic therapy.
AB  - We report a case of mycotic aneurysm of the ileocolic artery due to Streptococcus bovis endocarditis and acute septicemia complicated by active hemorrhage, that was treated successfully with transcatheter embolization and subsequent intravenous antibiotic treatment. This case suggests that a mycotic aneurysm can be treated successfully by percutaneous embolization in an emergent situation (active bleeding, septicemia) even without previous antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis meningitis in a neonate with Ivemark syndrome.
AB  - Although Streptococcus bovis infections in adults are associated with endocarditis and bowel neoplasms, S. bovis-associated meningitis is rare in neonates. We describe the case of a neonate with Ivemark syndrome, which possibly predisposed her to infection with this bacterium.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis meningitis in a healthy adult patient.
AB  - We describe the first case in the English language of Streptococcus bovis meningitis in a 45-y-old patient without any underlying disease or predisposing condition. S. bovis biotype II was isolated from his spinal fluid and blood. The illness was community-acquired and was clinically and biologically similar to disease caused by the classical meningeal pathogens. The patient was cured after 10 d of therapy with ceftriaxone and, 2.5 y later, is currently healthy. As a result of this case and a similar case published recently in the Spanish literature we conclude that S. bovis should be considered a microorganism capable of causing meningitis in the absence of any underlying condition or clear focus of infection.
TI  - Role of aminoglycosides in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis.
AB  - Aminoglycosides are often used in combination with glycopeptides and beta-lactams for the treatment of bacterial endocarditis caused by alpha-haemolytic streptococci, staphylococci and enterococci. Recommendations on dosing and duration of aminoglycoside therapy vary; we detail the laboratory and clinical evidence base for the treatment regimens advised. A number of deficiencies in the published guidelines are highlighted, as is the limited evidence base upon which many of the regimens are recommended. With the increasing use of outpatient treatment of severe infections and once daily administration of aminoglycosides the opportunity should be taken for larger, multicentre clinical trials to evaluate formally both old and new regimens.
TI  - Isolated pulmonary valve endocarditis caused by Streptococcus bovis: case report  and review.
AB  
TI  - Rapid immunohistochemical detection of Rhodococcus equi in impression smears from affected foals on postmortem examination.
AB  - The first objective of this study was to develop an immunohistochemical procedure for rapid detection of Rhodococcus equi in impression smears from affected organs of foals on postmortem examination. The second aim was to demonstrate whether R. equi can be detected in smears of tracheal exudates collected from the same foals using an immunohistochemical method. Impression smears and cryostat and paraffin-embedded sections were made from the lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes of three foals (A, B and C) that had died of respiratory disease caused by R. equi, and also from the caudal mesenteric lymph node of foal A. Impression smears were made from the tracheal exudates of all foals. An affinity purified rabbit IgG was used for the immunohistochemical demonstration of R. equi. This antibody reacted with serotype 1 of R. equi in Ouchterlony's immunodiffusion and in the passive haemagglutination test, but not with other serotypes or with Streptococcus equi ssp. equi or Staphylococcus aureus, and failed to give an immunohistochemical reaction with Mycobacterium bovis or M. paratuberculosis. The immunohistochemical method proved to be of identical sensitivity to bacterial culture; moreover, from the lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes of one foal, R. equi could only be detected by this method. R. equi was demonstrated in smears of the tracheal exudates of all three foals. The results of this study indicate that the immunohistochemical method may be used for the rapid detection of R. equi in impression smears from the affected organs, especially abscesses, obtained postmortem, and possibly as a tool for diagnosing R. equi pneumonia in live foals by examining smears of tracheal aspirates.
TI  - Microbial diversity of a mesophilic hydrogen-producing sludge.
AB  - A hydrogen-producing sludge degraded 99% of glucose at 36 degrees C and pH 5.5, producing a methane-free biogas (comprising 64% hydrogen) and an effluent comprising mostly butyrate, acetate, and ethanol. The yield was 0.26 l H2 g(-1) glucose and the production rate per gram of volatile suspended solids was 4.6 1 H2 day(-1). A 16S rDNA library was constructed from the sludge for microbial species determination. A total of 96 clones were selected for plasmids recovery, screened by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and sequenced for rDNA. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the rDNA sequences, 64.6% of all the clones were affiliated with three Clostridium species (Clostridiaceae), 18.8% with Enterobacteriaceae, and 3.1% with Streptococcus bovis (Streptococcaceae). The remaining 13.5% belonged to eight operational taxonomic units, the affiliations of which were not identified.
TI  - Discitis associated with pregnancy and spinal anesthesia.
AB  - Discitis (inflammation of the intervertebral disk) most commonly develops as a rare complication of bacterial infection or chemical or mechanical irritation during spine surgery (1) with a postoperative incidence of 1%-2.8% (2). It is also a complication of discography-the intradiscal injection of saline or contrast material (3). The incidence of postdiscography discitis is 1%-4% (3); no cases have been reported when prophylactic antibiotics have been used, supporting the theory of bacterial contamination (3). Although it is controversial whether discitis can be caused by an aseptic or infectious process, recent data suggest that persistent discitis is almost always bacterial (4). Honan et al. (5) reported 16 cases of spontaneous discitis and reviewed another 52 patients from the literature. In their series, patients tended to have one or more comorbid conditions, such as diabetes, vertebral fracture, or a preexisting spine injury. Spontaneous discitis has also been associated with advanced age, IV drug abuse, IV access contamination, urinary tract infection, and immunocompromised states (5,6). No cases of infectious discitis associated with pregnancy and spinal anesthesia have been reported in the English literature. Discitis presents as spasmodic pain in the back that may be referred to the hips or groin (7). The pain may radiate to the lower extremities. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is usually increased. Radiological changes in discitis include narrowing of the intervertebral disk space, vertebral sclerosis, and erosion of the end plates. The best diagnostic measure may be magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or a combination of bone and gallium scanning (2). The mainstay for discitis treatment is pain control and antibiotics; surgical intervention is usually not required. Complications of discitis include intervertebral fusion, epidural abscess, and paralysis. IMPLICATIONS: This is a case report of a disk infection (discitis) caused by the bacteria, Streptococcus bovis after spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery. S. bovis rarely causes discitis, and spinal anesthesia for labor and delivery has not been reported as a cause of discitis.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of Mycobacterium bovis BCG pcp gene encoding pyrrolidone carboxyl peptidase.
AB  - The Mycobacterium bovis bacilli Calmette-Guerin (BCG) pcp gene that encodes the pyrrolidone carboxyl peptidase (Pcp) was cloned from a lambdagtll genomic library and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence contains a 669 bp open reading frame coding for a protein of 222 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 23,209 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence is highly homologous to the Pcps from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. A multiple sequence alignment revealed highly conserved domains. The BCG pcp gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The Pcp was purified to homogeneity. The recombinant protein was further confirmed by an enzymatic assay.
TI  - [Susceptibility to penicillin and 13 antimicrobial agents in erythromycin-resistant viridans group streptococci isolated from blood cultures].
AB  - From March 1998 to June 1999, we studied 63 sequential blood culture isolates of  viridans group streptococci which showed a 49% resistance to erythromycin. A high level of resistance to penicillin (46%) was also found. A statistically significant correlation was detected between the two types of resistance. The erythromycin-resistant strains were phenotypically and genotypically characterized, and no differences were found between the resistance to penicillin and the M or MLS(B) phenotypes. The penicillin-erythromycin-resistant strains included: 16 S. mitis, five S. sanguis and one S. salivarius. The rank order of activity (% of susceptibility) for all 14 agents against 31 erythromycin- resistant isolates was the following: vancomycin = rifampicin (100) > chloramphenicol (98) > meropenem (65) > cefotaxime (61) > amoxicillin- clavulanic acid (42) > cefepime = ciprofloxacin (39) > tetracycline = trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (36) > cefuroxime (32) > penicillin = ampicillin = cefaclor (29). The species S. milleri and S. bovis were the most susceptible. The most resistant strains were two S. mitis and one S. sanguis and showed multiresistance to six different groups of antimicrobial agents. The frequent association between macrolide resistance and resistance to other antimicrobial agents suggests that the susceptibility of all clinically significant isolates needs to be evaluated and alternative agents for the prevention and treatment of viridans group streptococci infections should be identified.
TI  - Development of a Brucella suis specific hybridisation probe and PCR which distinguishes B. suis from Brucella abortus.
AB  - A genomic library was prepared from Brucella suis DNA (MboI digested) and cloned  into the BamHI site of pUC18. Colony hybridisation using a probe prepared from purified B. suis DNA labelled with alpha 32P was carried out to identify colonies of interest. About 20 colonies, which gave an intense signal upon hybridisation with whole B. suis genomic DNA as a probe, were selected. Because of the high degree of DNA homology between B. suis and Brucella abortus, a short probe was chosen as it would more likely give species specificity. Of seven fragments selected to probe whole B. suis, B. abortus, and Yersinia enterocolitica DNA, one was found to hybridise with B. suis only. The probe was sequenced in two directions and sense and anti sense primers of 25bp in length were chosen to yield a product of 421bp. After optimisation of the PCR, a product of 420bp was obtained with B. suis template DNA and two bands of 420 and 650bp were detected with B. abortus template DNA. This is the first reported PCR of the Brucella genome where a single pair of primers will discriminate between B. suis and B. abortus. No band was observed when the two primers were used to amplify E. coli, Y. enterocolitica, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, Corynebacterium bovis, or Serratia marcescens template DNA.
TI  - [Infectious endocarditis in France today].
AB  - Infectious endocarditis (IE) is an uncommon condition carrying a relatively high  mortality and morbidity. Two epidemiological studies, undertaken eight years apart, provide data allowing an appreciation of changes in the epidemiological and clinical profiles of IE. They show a progressive increase in the age of patients affected by IE and a decrease in percentage of IE on native pathological valves and valvular prostheses, compensated by the increase in incidence of IE occurring in patients with no known underlying cardiac disease. Moreover, there has been a change in microbiological profile, with the emergence of Streptococcus bovis and increase in staphylococcal IE, a decrease in IE due to oral streptococci and an improvement in microbiological diagnosis with negative blood cultures. Finally, from the therapeutic point of view, surgery is used more frequently and at an earlier stage of the disease. The global mortality of IE at the end of the initial hospital period remains 16%.
TI  - High prevalence of inducible erythromycin resistance among Streptococcus bovis isolates in Taiwan.
AB  - Susceptibilities to 13 antimicrobial agents were determined by measurement of MICs for 60 isolates of Streptococcus bovis from blood cultures. Thirty-eight isolates (63.3%) had high-level resistance to erythromycin (MICs, >or=128 microg/ml). Among the 38 erythromycin-resistant strains, 21 isolates (55%) had inducible resistance to macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin B (iMLS isolates) and 17 (45%) had constitutive resistance to macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin B (cMLS isolates). Tetracycline resistance was also found among all of the erythromycin-resistant strains. None of the strains displayed resistance to penicillin, chloramphenicol, or vancomycin. Detection of erythromycin resistance genes by PCR and sequencing indicated that all 17 cMLS isolates were positive for the ermB gene and that 7 of 21 iMLS isolates carried the ermB gene and the remaining 14 iMLS isolates carried the ermT gene. Sequence analysis of amplified partial ermB fragments (594 bp) from S. bovis isolates revealed a 99.8% nucleotide identity and a 100% amino acid homology compared with the sequences from gene banks. The sequences of amplified fragments with primers targeted for ermC were shown to be very similar to that of ermGT (ermT) from Lactobacillus reuteri (98.5% nucleotide identity). This is the first report to describe the detection of the ermT class of erythromycin resistance determinants in S. bovis. The high rate of inducible erythromycin resistance among S. bovis isolates in Taiwan was not reported before. The iMLS S. bovis isolates were shown to be heterogeneous by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis. These results indicate that the prevalence of inducible erythromycin resistance in S. bovis in Taiwan is very high and that most of the resistant strains carry the ermT or the ermB gene.
TI  - Recombinant Escherichia coli engineered for production of L-lactic acid from hexose and pentose sugars.
AB  - Recombinant Escherichia coli have been constructed for the conversion of glucose  as well as pentose sugars into L-lactic acid. The strains carry the lactate dehydrogenase gene from Streptococcus bovis on a low copy number plasmid for production of L-lactate. Three E. coli strains were transformed with the plasmid for producing L-lactic acid. Strains FBR9 and FBR11 were serially transferred 10 times in anaerobic cultures in sugar-limited medium containing glucose or xylose without selective antibiotic. An average of 96% of both FBR9 and FBR11 cells maintained pVALDH1 in anaerobic cultures. The fermentation performances of FBR9, FBR10, and FBR11 were compared in pH-controlled batch fermentations with medium containing 10% w/v glucose. Fermentation results were superior for FBR11, an E. coli B strain, compared to those observed for FBR9 or FBR10. FBR11 exhausted the glucose within 30 h, and the maximum lactic acid concentration (7.32% w/v) was 93% of the theoretical maximum. The other side-products detected were cell mass and succinic acid (0.5 g/l).
TI  - Comparison of clinical and echocardiographic characteristics of Streptococcus bovis endocarditis with that caused by other pathogens.
AB  - The aim of our study was to compare the clinical, echographic, and prognostic features of Streptococcus bovis (S. bovis) endocarditis with those caused by other streptococci and pathogens in a large sample of patients with definite endocarditis by Duke criteria, using transesophageal echocardiography. Two hundred six patients (149 men, mean age 57 +/- 15 years) with a diagnosis of infective endocarditis formed the study population. All patients underwent multiplane transesophageal echocardiography and blood cultures. Cerebral, thoracoabdominal computed tomographic scan was performed in almost all patients (95%). All patients with S. bovis endocarditis underwent colonoscopy. Incidence of S. bovis endocarditis in our sample was 19%. Patients with S. bovis endocarditis were older than other groups. Multiple valve involvement, native valves, and large vegetations (>10 mm) were more frequent in patients with S. bovis. There was a significantly higher occurrence of embolism in the S. bovis group. Splenic embolism and multiple embolisms were significantly more frequent in patients with S. bovis. Gastrointestinal lesions, anemia, and spondylitis were observed more frequently with S. bovis endocarditis. In addition to the requirement for gastrointestinal examination for S. bovis endocarditis, our study underlines the need for systematic screening for vertebral and splenic localizations, and suggests the use of early surgery to prevent the high risk of embolism in these patients.
TI  - The effect of condensed tannins from Lotus pedunculatus and Lotus corniculatus on the growth of proteolytic rumen bacteria in vitro and their possible mode of action.
AB  - Five strains of proteolytic rumen bacteria were treated with condensed tannins (CT) purified from Lotus pedunculatus and Lotus corniculatus to investigate their effect on the growth of these bacteria in vitro. Streptococcus bovis NCFB 2476, Eubacterium sp. C124b, Prevotella bryantii B14, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens H17c, and Clostridium proteoclasticum B316T were tested against 200, 400, and 600 microg CT x mL(-1) extracted from L. pedunculatus and L. corniculatus. In the absence of CT, all bacterial strains showed typical growth and reached maximum optical density (OD) after 6-8 h of incubation in a plant protein medium. Growth of Eubacterium sp., P. bryantii, and B. fibrisolvens was inhibited (P < 0.01-0.001) more by the CT from L. pedunculatus than by the CT from L. corniculatus. All strains continued to grow in the presence of 200 microg x mL(-1) of the CT from L. pedunculatus, but attained significantly (P < 0.05-0.01) lower maximum OD600 values than (minus CT) controls, except for S. bovis. At 400 and 600 microg x mL(-1), the addition of CT from L. pedunculatus inhibited (P < 0.05-0.001) the growth of all bacterial strains tested compared with controls. The growth of Eubacterium sp. and P. bryantii was stimulated for the first 4-6 h of incubation (P < 0.001) by 200 microg x mL(-1) of CT from L. corniculatus, but then declined leading to a significant difference in OD values compared with the controls. At 400 microg x mL(-1), the CT from L. corniculatus reduced (P < 0.05-0.01) the growth of all strains except S. bovis, while 600 microg x mL(-1) inhibited (P < 0.01-0.001) the growth of all strains. To study the mechanism of CT action, the degradation of the large subunit (LSU) of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco; Fraction 1 Leaf protein) was followed after bacterial cells or Rubisco were preincubated with CT extracted from L. corniculatus and L. pedunculatus. Both preincubations decreased LSU degradation, but they differed in their response to polyethylene glycol (PEG) addition. Addition of PEG to CT-Rubisco preincubations negated the effects of CT, while PEG addition to CT-bacteria preincubations did not. This implies that the CT-bacterial interaction is stronger than the CT-Rubisco interaction or the interaction is of a different type. Also, L. pedunculatus CT reduced the degradation of the LSU to a greater extent than the CT from L. corniculatus when preincubated with bacteria.
TI  - Prevalence of liver disease in patients with Streptococcus bovis bacteraemia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between Streptococcus bovis bacteraemia and gastrointestinal disease (mainly colon cancer) is well known. Patients with advanced liver disease are prone to bacteraemia. Less attention has been paid to the association between liver disease and Streptococcus bovis bacteraemia in the literature. AIMS: To evaluate the prevalence of liver disease in patients with S. bovis bacteraemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-two episodes of S. bovis bacteraemia in 20 adults (13 males and seven females, with a median age of 61 years, range 32-94 years) were detected in a single hospital over a 7-year period. Ten of them had endocarditis. Patients' clinical records were reviewed, with special focus on underlying liver and gastrointestinal disease. RESULTS: Eleven patients (55%) had a chronic liver disease. Nine of them were cirrhotics. Ten patients had a history of chronic alcohol abuse, and four patients had hepatitis C virus antibodies (associated with alcohol abuse in three cases). Large bowel disease was present in six out of 13 evaluable patients (adenocarcinoma in three cases). Patients with liver disease were younger than patients without it. Mortality related to S. bovis bacteraemia was particularly high among patients with advanced liver disease (Child-Pugh state C). Bacteraemia recurred two times in one alcoholic cirrhotic, who was diagnosed as having a Dukes-B colon cancer 4.5 years after the first episode of S. bovis bacteraemia. CONCLUSIONS: In our area, S. bovis bacteraemia is frequently associated with chronic liver disease. Liver disease may be a predisposing factor for S. bovis bacteraemia.
TI  - Restriction and modification systems of ruminal bacteria.
AB  - A high frequency of type II restriction endonuclease activities was detected in Selenomonas ruminantium but not in other rumen bacteria tested. Eight different restriction endonucleases were characterized in 17 strains coming from genetically homogeneous local population. Chromosomal DNA isolated from S. ruminantium strains was found to be refractory to cleavage by various restriction enzymes, implying the presence of methylase activities additional to those required for protection against the cellular endonucleases. The presence of Dam methylation was detected in S. ruminantium strains as well as in several other species belonging to the Sporomusa subbranch of low G + C Gram-positive bacteria (Megasphaera elsdenii, Mitsuokella multiacidus).
TI  - [Pneumonia in calves: characterization of the bacterial spectrum and the resistance patterns to antimicrobial drugs].
AB  - The population under study included young calves with pneumonia (group A, n = 13) and their controls (group B, n = 9), as well as older calves from which the lungs with (group C, n = 90) or without (group D, n = 10) lesions were collected after slaughter. Arcanobacterium pyogenes was the organism most commonly isolated from calves in group A (46%), followed by Haemophilus somnus (23%), Mannheimia haemolytica (15%), Streptococcus suis and Pasteurella multocida (7.7% each). Only S. suis (22%) and P. multocida (11%) were found in group B. P. multocida was isolated from 32% group C calves, H. somnus from 11%, A. pyogenes from 7.8%, M. haemolytica from 2.2% and S. suis from 1.1%. No specific pathogens were isolated in group D. Prevalence of Mycoplasma bovis infection was 69% in group A and 37% in group C. Ninety-eight strains were tested for resistAnce to antibiotics. Resistance to penicillin and ampicillin was present only in M. haemolytica (46%). High percentages of resistant strains were observed for streptomycin (48-100%), tetracycline (15-43%), sulfonamides alone (14-100%) or in combination with trimethoprim (0-100%). Therapeutic approaches to bacterial calf pneumonia in the area under study should be modified according to the isolated bacterial population, the observed antimicrobial resistances and the growing importance of Mycoplasma bovis.
TI  - [Agranulocytosis and epileptic seizure during prolonged ceftriaxone treatment].

TI  - Dextran acceptor reaction of Streptococcus sobrinus glucosyltransferase GTF-I as  revealed by using uniformly 13C-labeled sucrose.
AB  - A sucrose glucosyltransferase GTF-I from cariogenic Streptococcus sobrinus transferred the uniformly 13C-labeled glucosyl residue ([U-(13)C]Glc) from [U-(13)C]sucrose to exogenous dextran T500 at the non-reducing-end, mostly by alpha-(1-->6) linkages and partially by alpha-(1-->3) linkages, as revealed by the 13C-(13)C NMR coupling pattern. With increasing amounts of [U-(13)C]sucrose, transfer of [U-(13)C]Glc to the alpha-(1-->3)-linked chain became predominant without increase in the number of chains. The transfer of [U-(13)C]Glc to an isomaltopentaose acceptor occurred similarly to its transfer to T500. alpha-(1-->3)-branches in the [U-(13)C]dextran, specifically synthesized from [U-(13)C]sucrose by a Streptococcus bovis dextransucrase, were not formed by GTF-I, as judged by the observation that a newly-formed alpha-1,3,6-branched [U-(13)C]Glc was not detected, which could have been formed by transferring the unlabeled Glc from sucrose to the internal alpha-(1-->6)-linked [U-(13)C]Glc at C-3. The 13C-(13)C one-bond coupling constants (1J) were also recorded for the C-1--C-6 bond of the internal alpha-(1-->6)-linked [U-(13)C]Glc and of the non-reducing-end [U-(13)C]Glc.
TI  - Optimisation of the prevention and treatment of bacterial endocarditis.
AB  - This paper reviews currently established guidelines for the prevention and treatment of bacterial endocarditis. Endocarditis remains a life-threatening disease with substantial morbidity and mortality. Primary prevention of endocarditis, whenever possible, is therefore very important. In an individual with endocarditis, rapid diagnosis and effective treatment are essential to good patient outcome. The guidelines discussed here are largely based on those issued by the American Heart Association. While most cases of endocarditis are not attributable to an invasive procedure, certain procedures are associated with bacteraemia by organisms commonly associated with endocarditis, and antibacterial prophylaxis is recommended before such procedures. Patient cardiac conditions are stratified into high, moderate and negligible risk categories based on potential outcome if endocarditis develops. For oral, dental, respiratory tract, and oesophageal procedures (most often associated with viridans streptococci) the standard antibacterial regimen is oral amoxicillin. For gastrointestinal and genitourinary procedures (most often associated with enterococci), parenteral antibacterials are most often recommended. For high-risk patients, intramuscular or intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin (or vancomycin and gentamicin in penicillin-allergic individuals) is recommended. For moderate risk patients, an option of oral amoxicillin or parenteral ampicillin is offered. Treatment of bacterial endocarditis is guided by identification of the causative micro-organism. Approximately 80% of cases of endocarditis are due to the gram-positive cocci: streptococci and staphylococci. Other gram-positive organisms include enterococci (predominantly Enterococcusfaecalis and E. faecium) and the HACEK group of organisms (Haemophilus parainfluenzae, H. aphrophilus, Actinobacillus [Haemophilus] actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella kingae). In general, for uncomplicated cases of endocarditis due to penicillin-susceptible viridans streptococci or Streptococcus bovis 4 weeks of benzylpenicillin (or ceftriaxone) is the preferred regimen for most patients aged >65 years. A 2-week course of treatment can be used when gentamicin is added, in patients at low risk for adverse events caused by gentamicin therapy. When endocarditis is caused by strains of viridans streptococci or S. bovis relatively resistant to penicillin, or by enterococci, both benzylpenicillin and gentamicin are recommended. For staphylococcal endocarditis on native heart valves, nafcillin or oxacillin with or without gentamicin is the preferred regimen. In prosthetic valve staphylococcal endocarditis, nafcillin (or oxacillin) with rifampicin and gentamicin is recommended. For all of the above situations, vancomycin is recommended for the patient allergic to penicillin (or methicillin). Finally, consideration of out-of-hospital therapy in selected patients is discussed.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) compared to eleven other antimicrobial agents against streptococcal isolates, excluding Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - The purpose of the study presented here was to determine the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin compared with that of 11 other antimicrobial agents (5 of them quinolones) against 400 isolates of beta-haemolytic and viridans group streptococci. The minimum inhibitory concentration values for gemifloxacin against 90% of the streptococci tested were as follows: Lancefield groups A, C and G, 0.06 microg/ml; Lancefield group B, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus bovis, 0.125 microg/ml; and Streptococcus milleri, 0.03 microg/ml. Resistance to penicillin, ampicillin and erythromycin was found mainly in the Streptococcus mitis isolates; tetracycline showed variable results, and no vancomycin resistance was encountered. Higher rates of ciprofloxacin resistance were identified in the Streptococcus bovis, mitis and mutans isolates. In conclusion, gemifloxacin was the most active quinolone tested followed by trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, especially against isolates resistant to beta-lactam agents, macrolides and tetracycline.
TI  - The replicon of the cryptic Plasmid pSBO1 isolated from Streptococcus bovis JB1.
AB  - The cryptic plasmid pSBO1 (3904 bp) was isolated from Streptococcus bovis JB1. pSBO1 contained an open reading frame (ORF) that is homologous to sequences encoding the replication protein (Rep) in pEFC1 (isolated from Enterococcus faecalis), pSK639 (Staphylococcus epidermidis), pLA103 (Lactobacillus acidophilus), and pUCL287 (Tetragenococcus halophila). In addition, four 22-bp direct repeats (DRs) were located upstream of the putative replication gene (rep) of pSBO1. Recombinant plasmids (pSBE10 and pSBE11) containing the DRs and putative rep of pSBO1 replicated in S. bovis 12-U-1 and no8 strains. This result indicates that the putative rep encoded Rep and that the replicon of pSBO1 contained the DRs and the rep. Gel shift assays showed that the Rep of pSBO1 bound the 22-bp DRs.
TI  - Diet-dependent shifts in the bacterial population of the rumen revealed with real-time PCR.
AB  - A set of PCR primers was designed and validated for specific detection and quantification of Prevotella ruminicola, Prevotella albensis, Prevotella bryantii, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Selenomonas ruminantium-Mitsuokella multiacida, Streptococcus bovis, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Ruminobacter amylophilus, Eubacterium ruminantium, Treponema bryantii, Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, and Anaerovibrio lipolytica. By using these primers and the real-time PCR technique, the corresponding species in the rumens of cows for which the diet was switched from hay to grain were quantitatively monitored. The dynamics of two fibrolytic bacteria, F. succinogenes and R. flavefaciens, were in agreement with those of earlier, culture-based experiments. The quantity of F. succinogenes DNA, predominant in animals on the hay diet, fell 20-fold on the third day of the switch to a grain diet and further declined on day 28, with a 57-fold reduction in DNA. The R. flavefaciens DNA concentration on day 3 declined to approximately 10% of its initial value in animals on the hay diet and remained at this level on day 28. During the transition period (day 3), the quantities of two ruminal prevotella DNAs increased considerably: that of P. ruminicola increased 7-fold and that of P. bryantii increased 263-fold. On day 28, the quantity of P. ruminicola DNA decreased 3-fold, while P. bryantii DNA was still elevated 10-fold in comparison with the level found in animals on the initial hay diet. The DNA specific for another xylanolytic bacterium, E. ruminantium, dropped 14-fold during the diet switch and was maintained at this level on day 28. The concentration of a rumen spirochete, T. bryantii, decreased less profoundly and stabilized with a sevenfold decline by day 28. The variations in A. lipolytica DNA were not statistically significant. After an initial slight increase in S. dextrinosolvens DNA on day 3, this DNA was not detected at the end of the experiment. S. bovis DNA displayed a 67-fold increase during the transition period on day 3. However, on day 28, it actually declined in comparison with the level in animals on the hay ration. The amount of S. ruminantium-M. multiacida DNA also increased eightfold following the diet switch, but stabilized with only a twofold increase on day 28. The real-time PCR technique also uncovered differential amplification of rumen bacterial templates with the set of universal bacterial primers. This observation may explain why some predominant rumen bacteria have not been detected in PCR-generated 16S ribosomal DNA libraries.
TI  - Infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis and lymphofollicular hyperplasia of the third eyelid in heifers.
AB  - On a dairy cattle farm, infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis was diagnosed in 29 (24%) calves and heifers aged from 2 weeks to 1 year old. The highest infection rate (18%) occurred in animals aged 3-6 months. The bacteriological examination of swabs from the affected animals yielded several species of bacteria: Moraxella bovis, Neisseria ovis, N. cuniculi, plasma coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp., alpha-haemolytic Streptococcus spp., Arcanobacterium pyogenes and Escherichia coli. Moraxella bovis and N. ovis were the most common isolates. Hyperplasia of the lymphatic tissue of the third eyelid in the form of nodules 7-8 mm in diameter was diagnosed in two heifers aged 8 and 10 months.
TI  - Aggregation substance-mediated adherence of Enterococcus faecalis to immobilized  extracellular matrix proteins.
AB  - Aggregation substance (AS) of Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), a sex pheromone plasmid encoded cell surface protein, mediates the formation of bacterial aggregates, thereby promoting plasmid transfer. The influence of pAD1-encoded AS, Asa1, on binding to immobilized extracellular matrix proteins was studied. The presence of AS increased enterococcal adherence to fibronectin more than eight-fold, to thrombospondin more than four-fold, to vitronectin more than three-fold, and to collagen type I more than two-fold (P<0.001). In contrast, binding to laminin and collagen type IV occurred independently of AS. Adherence of the constitutively AS expressing E. faecalis OG1X(pAM721) to immobilized fibronectin was found to be approximately five times higher than that of Staphylococcus aureus Cowan and approximately 30 times higher than that of Streptococcus bovis. Investigation of strains with various deletions within the structural gene of asa1 suggests that attachment to immobilized fibronectin is mainly mediated by amino acids within the variable region or by neighbouring residues. Thus, AS may promote adherence to injured epithelium and endothelium, where extracellular matrix proteins are exposed, thereby facilitating colonization and infection.
TI  - A first case of Streptococcus bovis bacteremia and peritonitis from endometrial cancer origin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The most important clinical infections caused by Streptococcus Bovis  are bacteremia and endocarditis. Usually, Streptococcus Bovis bacteremia has been described in association with bowel pathology. CASE REPORT: A 67-year-old woman with an history of endometrial cancer Ic was admitted with the suspicion of peritonitis at examination. At exploratory laparotomy, a total hysterectomy was performed and the abdomen was drained. Histology revealed an uterine adenocarcinoma staged IIIa with intramyometrial cocci accumulation. Streptococcus Bovis was isolated from the peritoneal fluid cultures and three haemocultures. CONCLUSION: Because we excluded bowel pathology and endocarditis, this is the first case of Streptococcus Bovis bacteremia from endometrial cancer origin.
TI  - Rapid identification of tissue micro-organisms in skin biopsy specimens from domestic animals using polyclonal BCG antibody.
AB  - Immunostaining with polyclonal anti-Mycobacterium bovis (BCG) was evaluated as a  single screening method for the histological identification of micro-organisms in skin biopsy specimens from various veterinary species. Confirmed archival cases infected with Mycobacteria, Nocardia, Actinobacillus, Actinomyces, Streptococcus/Staphylococcus, Dermatophilus, spirochetes, Blastomyces, Coccidioides, Cryptococcus, Histoplasma, dermatophytes, Malassezia, Sporothrix, Leishmania, Pythium, phaeohyphomycetes and Prototheca organisms were selected. A total of 70 skin biopsy specimens from the dog, cat, horse, ox and llama were evaluated. The anti-BCG immunostain labelled bacteria and fungi with high sensitivity and minimal background staining but did not label spirochetes and protozoa (Leishmania). Differences were not noted between veterinary species. The results indicate that immunostaining with polyclonal anti-BCG is a suitable screening technique for the rapid identification of most common bacterial and fungal organisms in paraffin-embedded specimens. Also, mycobacterial and nocardial organisms were identified more readily with the anti-BCG immunostain in comparison to the histochemical stains.

TI  - Definite streptococcus bovis endocarditis: characteristics in 20 patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the specific characteristics of Streptococcus bovis infective endocarditis (IE) by reviewing our own experience of S. bovis IE. METHODS: Twenty episodes of definite S. bovis IE were reviewed in 20 patients hospitalized from 1980 to 1996. RESULTS: The mean age was 62 +/- 14 years, and 14 (70%) patients had no known predisposing cardiac condition. The principal antimicrobials used were penicillin G (N = 10) and amoxycillin (N = 8). Surgery was required in four (20%) patients. Neurologic complications occurred in eight (40%) patients, after initiation of therapy in six (75%) (mean time: 14 days). An unfavorable outcome was observed in four of 20 patients and tended to be more frequent in patients who had had neurologic complications (P = 0.10). Colonic tumors were present in 11 of 16 (69%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced age, occurrence of IE on presumably normal valves, high rate of neurologic complications, associated gastrointestinal diseases and low mortality rate during initial follow-up are characteristic features of S. bovis IE observed in this study.
TI  - Effect of hydrolysable and condensed tannins on growth, morphology and metabolism of Streptococcus gallolyticus (S. caprinus) and Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus (S. caprinus) was resistant in vitro to at least 7% (w/v) tannic acid and 4% (w/v) acacia condensed tannin, levels 10-fold greater than those tolerated by S. bovis. Growth of S. gallolyticus in liquid medium was characterized by a lag period which increased, and a growth rate which decreased, with increasing tannin concentration. S. gallolyticus was also more tolerant to the presence of simple phenolic acid monomers than was S. bovis, but the lag period was still concentration dependent. Gallate decarboxylase activity in S. gallolyticus was elevated in the presence of tannic acid or gallic acid but not with other phenolic acids. Scanning electron microscopic analysis showed that both the size and shape of S. gallolyticus and S. bovis changed in response to tannin but only S. gallolyticus was surrounded by an extracellular polysaccharide matrix which accumulated in a tannin-concentration-dependent fashion. Washing of the cells to remove extracellular polysaccharide increased the lag period of S. gallolyticus in the presence of 1% (w/v) tannic acid from 4 h to 6 h. In contrast, increasing extracellular polysaccharide synthesis in S. bovis did not increase its tolerance to tannic acid. These data demonstrate that S. gallolyticus has developed a number of mechanisms to reduce the potential effect of tannins on cell growth, and that these mechanisms provide the organism with a selective advantage over S. bovis when grown in the presence of tannins.
TI  - 16S ribosomal DNA sequence analysis distinguishes biotypes of Streptococcus bovis: Streptococcus bovis Biotype II/2 is a separate genospecies and the predominant clinical isolate in adult males.
AB  - We characterized 22 human clinical strains of Streptococcus bovis by genotypic (16S rRNA gene sequence analysis [MicroSeq]; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) and phenotypic (API 20 Strep and Rapid ID32 Strep systems (bioMerieux Vitek, Hazelton, Mo.) methods. The strains, isolated from blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and urine, formed two distinct 16S ribosomal DNA sequence clusters. Three strains which were associated with endocarditis urinary tract infection (UTI), and sepsis clustered with the S. bovis type strain ATCC 33317 (cluster 1); other closely related type strains were S. equinus and S. infantarius. Nineteen strains clustered at a distance of about 2.5% dissimilarity to the S. bovis type strain (cluster 2) and were associated with central nervous system (CNS) disease in addition to endocarditis, UTI, and sepsis. All strains were distinct from S. gallolyticus. Within cluster 2, a single strain grouped with ATCC strain 43143 (cluster 2a) and may be phenotypically distinct. All the other strains formed a second subgroup (cluster 2b) that was biochemically similar to S. bovis biotype II/2 (mannitol negative and beta galactosidase, alpha galactosidase, beta glucuronidase, and trehalose positive). The API 20 Strep system identified isolates of cluster 2b as S. bovis biotype II/2, those of cluster 1 as S. bovis biotype II/1, and that of cluster 2a as S. bovis biotype I. There was an excellent correlation of biotype and genotype: S. bovis biotype II/2 isolates form a separate genospecies distinct from the S. bovis, S. gallolyticus, and S. infantarius type strains and are the most common isolates in adult males.
TI  - The physiological and genetic diversity of bovine Streptococcus bovis strains(1).
AB  - Laboratory Streptococcus bovis strains and isolates obtained from a steer fed increasing amounts of grain had similar growth characteristics, but they differed in their sensitivity to 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), a non-metabolizable glucose analog. The addition of 2DG decreased both growth rate (0.92+/-0.34 h(-1)) and growth yield (ranging from 25 to 63%), but these differences could not be correlated with diet. However, isolates from a steer fed a 90% grain diet were more prone to 2DG-dependent lysis than those from a hay diet (P<0.001). All S. bovis laboratory strains and isolates had an identical restriction fragment length polymorphism pattern, when their 16S rDNA was digested with HaeIII and HhaI. However, when genomic BOX elements were amplified, 5-12 bands were observed, and the S. bovis isolates and laboratory strains could be grouped into 13 different BOX types. Strains 26 and 581AXY2 had the same BOX type, but the remaining laboratory strains did not form closely related clusters. Strains JB1 and K27FF4 were most closely related to each other. Most of the fresh isolates (24 out of 30) could be grouped into a single cluster (>90% Dice similarity). This cluster contained isolates from all three diets, but it did not have any of the laboratory strains. The majority (90%) of the isolates obtained from the hay-fed steer exhibited the same BOX type. Because more BOX types were observed if grain was added to the diet, it appears that ruminal S. bovis diversity may be a diet-dependent phenomenon.
TI  - In vitro evidence for a bacterial pathogenesis of equine laminitis.
AB  - Utilizing an in vitro laminitis explant model, we have investigated how bacterial broth cultures and purified bacterial proteases activate matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and alter structural integrity of cultured equine lamellar hoof explants. Four Gram-positive Streptococcus spp. and three Gram-negative bacteria all induced a dose-dependent activation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and caused lamellar explants to separate. MMP activation was deemed to have occurred if a specific MMP inhibitor, batimastat, blocked MMP activity and prevented lamellar separation. Thermolysin and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SpeB) both separated explants dose-dependently but only thermolysin was inhibitable by batimastat or induced MMP activation equivalent to that seen with bacterial broths. Additionally, thermolysin and broth MMP activation appeared to be cell dependent as MMP activation did not occur in isolation. These results suggest the rapid increase in streptococcal species in the caecum and colon observed in parallel with carbohydrate induced equine laminitis may directly cause laminitis via production of exotoxin(s) capable of activating resident MMPs within the lamellar structure. Once activated, these MMPs can degrade key components of the basement membrane (BM) hemidesmosome complex, ultimately separating the BM from the epidermal basal cells resulting in the characteristic laminitis histopathology of hoof lamellae. While many different causative agents have been evaluated in the past, the results of this study provide a unifying aetiological mechanism for the development of carbohydrate induced equine laminitis.

AB  - Many types of infections associated with colorectal cancer have been reported. Here, we describe a rare case of thoracic empyema that was observed during immunotherapy for recurrent colon cancer. Culture of the pleural fluid yielded Streptococcus bovis, which is known to be associated with gastrointestinal lesions, especially colorectal malignancies. The possible correlation between these two clinical entities-empyema and colon cancer-is discussed.
TI  - [Streptococcus gallolyticus infections in racing pigeons, a literature review].
AB  - S. gallolyticus, formerly known as S. bovis is known since 1988 as a facultative  pathogen of racing pigeons. Important clinical signs include acute mortality, inability to fly, lameness, weight loss and slimy green diarrhea. A pathognomonic sign at post mortem examination is the presence of well circumscribed areas of necrosis in the pectoral muscle. Furthermore tenosynovitis of the supracoracoid muscle and arthritis of the knee, shoulder and hock can be observed. In one study S. gallolyticus septicaemia was diagnosed in 10% of necropsied pigeons. Since S. gallolyticus was also isolated from nearly 40% of clinical healthy pigeons it is regarded as a facultative pathogen. Various biotypes, serotypes and culture supernatant phenotypes can be distinguished. Supernatant phenotypes are identified on the basis of the presence of either a T1, T2 or T3 protein triplet and the presence or absence of an extracellular A protein. S. gallolyticus strains with A protein are highly virulent, while strains with only T3 or T2 protein are of moderately or low virulence respectively. Fimbriae are only seen in highly virulent and some of the moderately virulent strains. Possible virulence factors include survival in macrophages, adhesion to cells and toxin production. Infection with serotype 1 and 2 induces some degree of protection against re-infection with serotype 1, which offers perspectives for the development of a vaccine. Experimentally ampicillin, doxycycline and erythromycin have shown therapeutic effects. For the treatment of clinical cases the use of ampicillin is advocated, together with hygienic measures, such as the use of grid floors and avoiding overcrowding.
TI  - Antibody response in sheep following immunization with Streptococcus bovis in different adjuvants.
AB  - Recent studies have shown that immunization with Streptococcus bovis using Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) may confer protection against lactic acidosis in sheep. The major objective of this study was to compare the antibody responses to S. bovis in a practically acceptable adjuvant (Freund's incomplete adjuvant (FIA); QuilA; dextran sulphate (Dex); Imject Alum; or Gerbu) and in FCA. Thirty-five sheep were randomly allocated to 7 treatment groups. Six groups were immunized with S. bovis in an adjuvant; the other group served as the non-immunization control. The primary immunization was administered intramuscularly on day 0. followed by a booster injection on day 28. Immunization with FCA induced the highest saliva and serum antibody responses. The saliva antibody concentrations in the FIA and QuilA groups were significantly higher than those in the Alum, Dex and Gerbu groups (p < 0.01). The serum antibody concentration in the FIA group was significantly higher than those in the QuilA, Alum. Dex and Gerbu groups (p < 0.01). Immunization enhanced the antibody level in faeces (p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference between the different adjuvant groups (p > 0.05). Seven and 14 days following booster immunization, the saliva antibody levels induced by QuilA and/or FIA were comparable with the level stimulated by FCA (p > 0.05). There was a strongly positive correlation (R2 = 0.770, p < 0.01) between the antibody concentrations in salival and serum. Compared with the controls, a higher faecal dry matter content was observed in the animals immunized with either FCA or QuilA. The change in faecal dry matter content was positively associated with the faecal antibody concentration (R2 = 0.441, p < 0.05). These results indicate that FIA and QuilA were effective at inducing high levels of antibody responses to S. bovis, and suggest that either Freund's incomplete adjuvant or QuilA may be useful for preparing a practically acceptable vaccine against lactic acidosis.

TI  - Competition among three predominant ruminal cellulolytic bacteria in the absence  or presence of non-cellulolytic bacteria.
AB  - Competition among three species of ruminal cellulolytic bacteria - Fibrobacter succinogenes S85, Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1 and Ruminococcus albus 7 - was studied in the presence or absence of the non-cellulolytic ruminal bacteria Selenomonas ruminantium or Streptococcus bovis. Co-cultures were grown under either batch or continuous conditions and populations were estimated using species-specific oligonucleotide probes to 16S rRNA. The three cellulolytic species co-existed in cellobiose batch co-culture, but inclusion of either Sel. ruminantium or Str. bovis yielded nearly a monoculture of the non-cellulolytic competitor. In cellobiose chemostats, R. albus completely dominated the triculture, but R. flavefaciens became predominant over F. succinogenes and R. albus when Sel. ruminantium was co-inoculated into the chemostats. Similar effects on competition were observed in the presence of Str. bovis at a lower (0.021 h(-1)), but not at a higher (0.045 h(-1)) dilution rate. In cellulose batch co-cultures, R. albus was more abundant than both F. succinogenes and R. flavefaciens, regardless of the presence of the non-cellulolytic species. Co-existence among the three cellulolytic species was observed in almost all cellulose chemostats, but Sel. ruminantium altered the relative proportions of the cellulolytic species. R. albus and R. flavefaciens were found to produce inhibitors that suppressed growth of R. flavefaciens and F. succinogenes, respectively. These data indicate that interactions among cellulolytic bacteria, while complex, can be modified further by non-cellulolytic species.
TI  - Nisin resistance of Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - The growth of Streptococcus bovis JB1 was initially inhibited by nisin (1 microM), and nisin caused a more than 3-log decrease in viability. However, some of the cells survived, and these nisin-resistant cells grew as rapidly as untreated ones. To see if the nisin resistance was merely a selection, nisin-sensitive cells were obtained from agar plates lacking nisin. Results indicated that virtually any nisin-sensitive cell could become nisin-resistant if the ratio of nisin to cells was not too high and the incubation period was long enough. Isolates obtained from the rumen were initially nisin sensitive, but they also developed nisin resistance. Nisin-resistant cultures remained nisin resistant even if nisin was not present, but competition studies indicated that nisin-sensitive cells could eventually displace the resistant ones if nisin was not present. Nisin-sensitive, glucose-energized cells lost virtually all of their intracellular potassium if 1 microM nisin was added, but resistant cells retained potassium even after addition of 10 microM nisin. Nisin-resistant cells were less hydrophobic and more lysozyme-resistant than nisin-sensitive cells. Because the nisin-resistant cells bound less cytochrome c, it appeared that nisin was being excluded by a net positive (i.e., less negative) charge. Nisin-resistant cells had more lipoteichoic acid than nisin-sensitive cells, and deesterified lipoteichoic acids from nisin-resistant cells migrated more slowly through a polyacrylamide gel than those from nisin-sensitive cells. These results indicated that lipoteichoic acids could be modified to increase the resistance of S. bovis to nisin. S. bovis JB1 cultures were still sensitive to monensin, tetracycline, vancomycin, and bacitracin, but ampicillin resistance was 1,000-fold greater.
TI  - Identification of bacteriocin-like inhibitors from rumen Streptococcus spp. and isolation and characterization of bovicin 255.
AB  - Streptococci obtained from rumen sources were tested for the production of antibacterial compounds using a deferred-antagonism plating assay. Of 35 isolates tested, 7 were identified that inhibited the growth of other streptococci. None of the inhibitory activity was due to bacteriophage. Three isolates, LRC0253, LRC0255, and LRC0476, were selected for further characterization. Analysis of 16S ribosomal DNA indicated that LRC0476 was a strain of Streptococcus bovis, while isolates LRC0253 and LRC0255 are likely strains of Streptococcus gallolyticus. The antibacterial compounds produced by these bacteria were protease sensitive, remained active in a pH range from 1 to 12, and did not lose activity after heating at 100 degrees C for 15 min. The inhibitory peptide from strain LRC0255 was purified using pH-dependent adsorption and desorption to bacterial cells, followed by ammonium sulfate precipitation and reversed-phase chromatography and gel filtration. The peptide was 6 kDa, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. An oligonucleotide probe based on the N-terminal sequence of the purified peptide was used to identify the gene encoding the inhibitory peptide. The antibacterial peptide has characteristics that are very similar to those described for class II bacteriocins of gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Characterization of the cryptic plasmid pSBO2 isolated from Streptococcus bovis JB1 and construction of a new shuttle vector.
AB  - A cryptic plasmid designated pSBO2 (3582 bp) was isolated from Streptococcus bovis JB1. The pSBO2 contained putative sites for a double-strand origin (dso), a small transcriptional repressor protein (Cop), countertranscribed RNAs (ctRNAs), and a replication protein (Rep), which were similar to those from pMV158 and pLS1, which were isolated from S. agalactiae, and pWVO1, isolated from Lactococcus lactis. The putative single-strand origin (sso) of pSBO2 was similar to pER341 and pST1, which were isolated from S. thermophilus. Recombinant plasmid designated pSBE2 was constructed to bind pECM184 vector and the DNA fragment containing sso, dso, Cop, ctRNAs, and Rep of pSBO2. When pSBE2 was introduced into S. bovis 12-U-1 and no8, the plasmids in the transformants had deleted the 160-bp fragment between sso and dso. This plasmid, designated pSBE2A, was capable of transforming Escherichia coli and S. bovis strains 12-U-1 and no8 on high frequency; therefore, pSBE2A is an effective shuttle vector.
TI  - Regulation of H(+)-ATPase synthesis in response to reduced pH in ruminal bacteria.
AB  - The capacity of ruminal bacteria to regulate H(+)-ATPase synthesis in response to reduced pH was investigated to explain acid tolerance. The activity of H(+)-ATPase in Streptococcus bovis, an acid-tolerant bacterium, was 2.2-fold higher at pH 4.5 than at pH 5.5. The increase in the amount of H(+)-ATPase protein was similar, suggesting that the increase in H(+)-ATPase activity is owing to the increase in H(+)-ATPase synthesis. The level of atp-mRNA at pH 4.5 was 2.5-fold higher than at pH 5.5, indicating that H(+)-ATPase synthesis is regulated at the transcriptional level, responding to low pH. In Ruminococcus albus, an acid-sensitive bacterium, H(+)-ATPase activity, the amount of H(+)-ATPase protein, and the level of atp-mRNA at pH 7.0 were similar to the values at pH 6.0, the lowest pH permitting growth. This result suggests that R. albus is incapable of enhancing H(+)-ATPase synthesis at low pH. Thus, acid tolerance appeared to be related to the capacity to augment the synthesis of H(+)-ATPase responding to low pH.
TI  - Significance of fecal volatile fatty acids in shedding of Escherichia coli O157 from calves: experimental infection and preliminary use of a probiotic product.
AB  - Cattle have been recognized as a principal reservoir of Escherichia coli O157:H7. This organism appears to be confined to the gastrointestinal tract and is shed in feces. A probiotic product containing lactic acid-producing Streptococcus bovis LCB6 and Lactobacillus gallinarum LCB 12 isolated from adult cattle was developed, and a preliminary experiment was conducted to evaluate its effect on the elimination of E. coli O157 from experimentally infected calves. Eight 4-month-old Holstein calves were orally challenged with E. coli O157 and the probiotic product was administered against four calves continued fecal shedding of E. coli O157 by the 7th day after infection. Fecal shedding of E. coli O157 was completely inhibited and re-shedding was not detected in any of the animals. Remarkable increase of VFAs, especially that of acetic acid in feces after the administration of probiotic bacteria correlated with the diminution of E. coli O157. Four calves that had spontaneously ceased fecal shedding of E. coli O157 by the 7th day exhibited a high concentration of VFAs in feces before and after experimental infection. Although our results are preliminary and obtained from calves under limited conditions, the possible application of probiotic product to reduce fecal shedding of E. coli O157 from cattle is suggested.

TI  - Emerging and reemerging pathogens.
AB  - From 1973 to 1995, 29 new and reemerging pathogenic microbes were recognized. However, in discussions about emerging infectious diseases, the focus is often on the clinical effects of the host-parasite relationship, rather than the examination of the biology of the pathogen. Many of what we refer to as emerging diseases are characterized better as 'diseases of human progress'. Thus, the aerosolization of water has played an important role in the emergence of Legionella pneumophila infections. New diseases are superimposed on endemic diseases such as diarrhoeal diseases, malaria and tuberculosis. In addition, many pathogens are becoming increasingly resistant to standard antimicrobial drugs, making treatment difficult and in some cases impossible. We summarize our experience on emerging parasitic diseases (primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, respiratory cryptosporidiosis, and diplogonoporiasis), and selected problems of bacterial resistance (MDR tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium bovis and macrolide-resistance mechanisms of Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes).
TI  - Identification of corynebacterium bovis and other coryneforms isolated from bovine mammary glands.
AB  - Bovine mastitis remains the most economically important disease in dairy cows. Corynebacterium bovis, a lipid-requiring Corynebacterium spp., is frequently isolated from the milk of infected mammary glands of dairy cows and is associated with reduced milk production. A total of 212 coryneform bacteria isolated from the milk of dairy cows were obtained from mastitis reference laboratories in the United States and Canada. All isolates had been presumptively identified as Corynebacterium bovis based on colony morphology and growth in the presence of butterfat. Preliminary identification of the isolates was based on Gram stain, oxidase, catalase, and growth on unsupplemented trypticase soy agar (TSA), TSA supplemented with 5% sheep blood, and TSA supplemented with 1% Tween 80. Of the 212 isolates tested, 183 were identified as Corynebacterium spp. based on preliminary characteristics. Of the strains misidentified, one was identified as a yeast, two as Bacillus spp., 11 as Enterobacteriaceae, 18 as staphylococci, one as a Streptococcus spp., and one as an Enterococcus spp. Eighty-seven coryneforms were selected for identification to the species level by direct sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, the Biolog system and the API Coryne system. Fifty strains were identified as C. bovis by 16S rRNA gene similarity studies: the Biolog and API Coryne systems correctly identified 54.0 and 88.0% of these strains, respectively. The other coryneforms were identified as other Corynebacterium spp., Rhodococcus spp., or Microbacterium spp. These data indicate that the coryneform bacteria isolated from bovine mammary glands are a heterogeneous group of organisms. Routine identification of C. bovis should include Gram-stain, cell morphology, catalase production, nitrate reduction, stimulated growth on 1% Tween 80 supplemented media, and beta-galactosidase production as the minimum requirements.
TI  - Infective endocarditis in patients receiving long-term hemodialysis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the predominant characteristics of patients receiving long-term dialysis who develop infective endocarditis (IE). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the records of all chronic hemodialysis patients who had IE at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn, between 1983 and 1997. RESULTS: Twenty episodes of IE occurred in 17 patients. One patient had 3 episodes of IE, and 1 patient had 2 episodes of IE; each episode was caused by a different organism. The mean +/- SD age of our patients was 63 +/- 11 years; there were 13 males; 6 patients had diabetes mellitus; and the mean +/- SD duration of hemodialysis prior to IE was 24.2 +/- 20.5 months. This analysis included 10 episodes of IE (occurring in 9 patients) within the Mayo Clinic Dialysis System during which time 223,358 hemodialysis treatments were delivered, giving a rate of 10 IE episode per 223,336 hemodialysis treatments. Among all 20 IE episodes, there were 14 synthetic arteriovenous grafts, 4 permanent venous dialysis catheters, 2 temporary venous dialysis catheters, and 2 native arteriovenous fistulas (2 accesses in 2 patients), and access had been in place for a mean +/- SD of 15.9 +/- 18.6 months. The portal of infection was the hemodialysis access in 13 episodes of IE. The causative organisms for IE were Staphylococcus aureus in 8 cases, Enterococcus sp in 4 cases, viridans streptococcus in 3 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 2 cases, and 1 case each of Streptococcus bovis, group G beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and Aspergillus sp. The mitral valve was involved in 9 cases, the aortic valve was involved in 5 cases, and the tricuspid and pulmonic valves were involved in 1 case each. Patient survival (after the first episode of IE) was 71% at 30 days; 53% at 60 days; and 35% at 1 year. Echocardiography was performed in 19 episodes of IE. The transthoracic echocardiogram was 62.5% sensitive and 40% specific for the presence of definite or probable vegetations. Univariate analysis for factors affecting 60-day survival show that presence of right-sided IE, vegetation size greater than 2.0 cm3, diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, and initial leukocyte count greater than 12.5 x 10(9)/L were poor prognostic factors. Aortic valve involvement carried a better prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Infective endocarditis in hemodialysis patients is relatively infrequent but has a high mortality. Patients with synthetic intravascular dialysis angioaccess (synthetic grafts and venous catheters) are more likely to develop IE than patients with native arteriovenous fistulas. Transesophageal echocardiography is a preferred echocardiographic study for suspected cases of IE. Prolonged antibiotic therapy is needed for all patients, and close monitoring is needed for patients with right-sided IE, large vegetations, diabetes mellitus, and an elevated leukocyte count.
TI  - Effects of thymol on ruminal microorganisms.
AB  - Thymol (5-methyl-2-isopropylphenol) is a phenolic compound that is used to inhibit oral bacteria. Because little is known regarding the effects of this compound on ruminal microorganisms, the objective of this study was to determine the effects of thymol on growth and lactate production by the ruminal bacteria Streptococcus bovis JB1 and Selenomonas ruminantium HD4. In addition, the effect of thymol on the in vitro fermentation of glucose by mixed ruminal microorganisms was investigated. Neither 45 nor 90 microg/ml of thymol had any significant effect on growth or lactate production by S. bovis JB1, but 180 microg/ml of thymol completely inhibited growth and lactate production. In the case of S. ruminantium HD4, 45 microg/ml of thymol had little effect on growth and lactate production; however, 90 microg/ml of thymol completely inhibited growth of S. ruminantium HD4. Thymol also decreased glucose uptake by whole cells of both bacteria. When mixed ruminal microorganisms were incubated in medium that contained glucose, 400 microg/ml of thymol increased final pH and the acetate to propionate ratio and decreased concentrations of methane, acetate, propionate, and lactate. In conclusion, thymol was a potent inhibitor of glucose fermentation by S. bovis JB1 and S. ruminantium HD4. Even though thymol treatment decreased methane and lactate concentrations and increased final pH in mixed ruminal microorganism fermentations of glucose, concentrations of acetate and propionate were also reduced.

TI  - Effects of pH and energy supply on activity and amount of pyruvate formate-lyase  in Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - The enzyme system of pyruvate formate-lyase (PFL) in Streptococcus bovis was investigated by isolating PFL and PFL-activating enzyme (PFL-AE) from S. bovis, flavodoxin from Escherichia coli, and chloroplasts from spinach. In this study, the PFL and PFL-AE in S. bovis were found to be similar to those in E. coli, suggesting that the activating mechanisms are similar. The optimal pH of S. bovis PFL was 7.5, which is in contrast to the optimal pH of S. bovis lactate dehydrogenase, which is 5.5. The apparent K(m) of S. bovis PFL was 2 mM. The intermediates of glycolysis, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP), were shown to inhibit PFL activity. The concentrations of intracellular DHAP and GAP in S. bovis ranged from 1.9 mM to less than 0.1 mM and from 0.6 mM to less than 0.05 mM, respectively, depending on the energy supply. The wide variations in DHAP and GAP levels indicated that PFL activity is allosterically regulated by these triose phosphates in vivo. The amount of PFL protein, as determined by Western blot analysis with polyclonal antibody, changed in parallel with the level of pfl-mRNA, responding to the culture conditions. These observations confirm that PFL synthesis is regulated at the transcriptional level and support the hypothesis that S. bovis shifts the fermentation pathway from acetate, formate, and ethanol production to lactate production when the pH is low and when excess energy is supplied.
TI  - Streptococcus infantarius sp. nov., Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius  subsp. nov. and Streptococcus infantarius subsp. coli subsp. nov., isolated from humans and food.
AB  - Eighteen strains isolated from human specimens or from food products were characterized as atypical variants of mannitol-negative Streptococcus bovis. They were tested for extended biochemical criteria, ribotyping and DNA-DNA hybridization in order to define their taxonomic status. These strains were demonstrated to constitute a DNA relatedness group that includes strains of DNA group 4 of Farrow et al. (1984). Comparative analysis of 16S rRNA sequences demonstrated that these strains represent a new species which belongs to the Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex and which has been provisionally named S. infantarius by Bouvet et al. (1997). Biotyping and ribotyping allowed differentiation of these strains from the aesculin-positive strains of S. bovis belonging to the previously described biotypes I, II.1 and II.2. The results of the ribotyping and hybridization assays demonstrated the presence of two different DNA subgroups within the 18 strains. On the basis of these data, the names S. infantarius subsp. infantarius (aesculin-negative for five strains out of seven, including the type strain HDP 90056T = NCDO 599T) and S. infantarius subsp. coli (aesculin-positive, reference strain HDP 90248 = NCDO 2620) are proposed as the names for these two subspecies within the S. infantarius species.

TI  - Deoxyribonuclease activity in Selenomonas ruminantium, Streptococcus bovis, and Bacteroides ovatus.
AB  - Six Selenomonas ruminantium strains (132c, JW13, SRK1, 179f, 5521c1, and 5934e),  Streptococcus bovis JB1, and Bacteroides ovatus V975 were examined for nuclease activity as well as the ability to utilize nucleic acids, ribose, and 2-deoxyribose. Nuclease activity was detected in sonicated cells and culture supernatants for all bacteria except S. ruminantium JW13 and 179f sonicated cells. S. ruminantium strains were able to utilize several deoxyribonucleosides, while S. bovis JB1 and B. ovatus V975 showed little or no growth on all deoxyribonucleosides. When S. ruminantium strains 5934e, 132c, JW13, and SRK1 were incubated in medium that contained 15 mm ribose, the major end products were acetate, propionate, and lactate. S. ruminantium 5521c1 and S. bovis JB1 did not grow on ribose, and none of the S. ruminantium strains or S. bovis JB1 grew on 15 mm 2-deoxyribose. In contrast, B. ovatus V975 was able to grow on ribose and 2-deoxyribose. In conclusion, all S. ruminantium strains, S. bovis JB1, and B. ovatus V975 had nuclease activity. However, not all bacteria were able to utilize deoxyribonucleosides, ribose, or 2-deoxyribose.
TI  - [Meningitis due to Streptococcus bovis type II].
AB  - Meningitis due to Streptococcus bovis is rare. Only 14 cases having been reported in the English literature. All patients (including the patient described) had an underlying disease or were treated by pharmacological agents that predisposed the patient to the infection. Most were treated by monotherapy with penicillin G (or amoxicillin) and recovered. We describe a 74-year-old woman who had splenectomy as treatment for hairy cell leukemia 6 months before hospitalization for meningitis and sepsis by S. bovis type II. She was successfully treated with intravenous amoxicillin. There was neither evidence of endocarditis nor carcinoma of the colon. Although the association between S. bovis meningitis and endocarditis or carcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract is not well established, we recommend a full work-up for GI malignancy and endocarditis in every patient with S. bovis meningitis.

TI  - Effects of various adjuvants on efficacy of a vaccine against Streptococcus bovis and Lactobacillus spp in cattle.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine efficacy of vaccines incorporating QuilA, alum, dextran combined with mineral oil, or Freund adjuvant for immunization of feedlot cattle against Streptococcus bovis and Lactobacillus spp. ANIMALS: 24 steers housed under feedlot conditions. PROCEDURE: Steers were randomly assigned to 4 experimental groups and a control group. Animals in experimental groups were inoculated on days 0 and 26 with vaccines containing Freund adjuvant (FCA), QuilA, dextran combined with mineral oil (Dex), or alum as adjuvant. Serum anti-S bovis and anti-Lactobacillus IgG concentrations were measured, along with fecal pH, ruminal fluid pH, and number of S bovis and Lactobacillus spp in ruminal fluid. RESULTS: Throughout the study, serum anti-S bovis and anti-Lactobacillus IgG concentrations for animals in the Dex, QuilA, and alum groups were similar to or significantly higher than concentrations for animals in the FCA group. Serum anti-S bovis and anti-Lactobacillus IgG concentrations were significantly increased on days 26 through 75 in all 4 experimental groups, and there was a linear relationship between anti-S bovis and anti-Lactobacillus IgG concentrations. For animals in the QuilA and Dex groups, mean pH of feces throughout the period of experiment were significantly higher and numbers of S bovis and Lactobacillus spp in ruminal fluid on day 47 were significantly lower than values for control cattle. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggest that immunization of feedlot steers against S bovis and Lactobacillus spp with vaccines incorporating Freund adjuvant, QuilA, dextran, or alum as an adjuvant effectively induced high, long-lasting serum anti-S bovis and anti-Lactobacillus IgG concentrations. Of the adjuvants tested, dextran may be the most effective.
TI  - Lack of GATC sites in the genome of Streptococcus bovis bacteriophage F4.
AB  - A strong bias against GATC sites was observed in the genome of phage F4, a lytic  Streptococcus bovis bacteriophage. Only three GATC sites were found within the 60.4-kbp genome of this phage. The comparative lack of GATC sequences within the F4 genome was probably not due to dam methylation, as no modification within this site was detected using methylation-sensitive isoschizomer pair restriction endonuclease analysis. The short oligonucleotide composition of available S. bovis DNA sequences suggested the existence of an unknown mechanism for counterselection of GATC sites in S. bovis bacteriophages.

TI  - Effects of ammonia and amino acids on the growth and proteolytic activity of three species of rumen bacteria: Prevotella albensis, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - The addition of increasing physiological concentrations of ammonia or amino acids had distinct effects on the growth and proteolytic activity of Streptococcus bovis JB1, Prevotella albensis, and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens DSM3071. The growth of S. bovis and B. fibrisolvens was enhanced by NH(3) and AA, and that of P. albensis was reduced compared with a control with protein as the sole source of nitrogen. The proteolytic activity of S. bovis and P. albensis was reduced, but that of B. fibrisolvens was improved. NH(3) seemed to act mainly on the cell-associated fraction of the proteolytic activity, while the action of AA was not specific. In the rumen the proteolytic activity of S. bovis and P. albensis would be optimal at low concentrations of NH(3) or AA (<0.05 and <0.27 g/L respectively). In contrast, B. fibrisolvens would need higher concentrations (0.5 g/L of NH(3) or 2.7 g/L of AA). It can be assumed that these bacteria will grow in different ecological niches.
TI  - Effect of steroidal saponin from Yucca schidigera extract on ruminal microbes.
AB  - The effects of steroidal saponins (SAP) isolated from Yucca schidigera extract on ruminal bacteria and fungi were investigated in pure culture studies. Prevotella bryantii, Ruminobacter amylophilus, Selenomonas ruminantium and Streptococcus bovis were cultured through ten 24-h transfers in ruminal fluid medium containing 0 or 25 microg SAP ml-1 (measured as smilagenin equivalents). The four strains, each non-exposed or pre-exposed to SAP, were then inoculated into medium containing 0 or 250 microgram smilagenin equivalents ml-1 and 24-h growth curves were determined. The cellulolytic ruminal bacteria Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Fibrobacter succinogenes and Rc. albus were cultured for 72 h on Whatman no. 1 filter paper in medium containing 0, 9, 90 or 180 microgram SAP ml-1 for the determination of filter paper digestion and endoglucanase activity. The ruminal bacteria differed in their responses to SAP. Steroidal saponins in the medium reduced the growth of Strep. bovis (P < 0.01 at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 h), P. bryantii (P < 0.05 at 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 24 h) and Rb. amylophilus (P < 0.05 at 14 and 24 h), but the growth of S. ruminantium was enhanced (P < 0.05) at 10, 14 and 24 h. The growth curves of all four non-cellulolytic species were similar (P > 0.05) between pre-exposed and non-exposed cultures and the concentrations of total SAP and soluble (deglycosylated) SAP in the liquid fraction were unchanged (P > 0.05) over time. Steroidal saponins inhibited the digestion of filter paper by all three cellulolytic bacteria, but F. succinogenes was less (P < 0.05) sensitive to SAP and more (P < 0. 05) effective at deglycosylating SAP than were Rc. flavefaciens or Rc. albus. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that SAP altered the cell walls of the SAP-inhibited non-cellulolytic bacteria. The ruminal fungi, Neocallimastix frontalis and Piromyces rhizinflata, were cultured on filter paper in medium containing 0, 0. 45, 2.25 or 4.5 microgram SAP ml-1. Filter paper digestion by both fungi was completely inhibited by 2.25 microgram SAP ml-1. Steroidal saponins from Y. schidigera inhibit cellulolytic ruminal bacteria and fungi, but their effects on amylolytic bacteria are species dependent and similar to the effects of ionophores. As such, SAP may be useful in nutritional applications targeting starch-digesting ruminal micro-organisms.

TI  - Identification of virulence associated markers in the cell wall of pigeon Streptococcus gallolyticus strains.
AB  - The cell wall protein profiles of 56 isolates of Streptococcus gallolyticus of differing virulence for pigeons were compared by SDS-PAGE. Additionally, Western blot analysis was performed on the cell wall proteins of 14 strains using sera of pigeons, experimentally infected with A(+)T1 or A(-)T2 strains of S. gallolyticus. The profile of silver stained gels exhibited a complex array of 20-50 bands ranging from less than 6.5-210kDa. A band with molecular mass of 114kDa was only observed in isolates that belonged to the highly virulent A(+)T1, A(+)T2, A(+)T3 and A(-)T1 culture supernatant groups. A band with a slightly higher molecular mass (115kDa) as well as a 207kDa band were only detected in isolates that belonged to the moderately A(-)T3 or low A(-)T2 virulent culture supernatant groups. The 114 and 115kDa band were recognised by all homologous and heterologous pigeon sera used whereas the 207kDa band was only recognised by sera of pigeons infected with a A(-)T2 strain. These findings may indicate that the 114, 115 and 207kDa bands are useful as additional virulence associated markers for pigeon S. gallolyticus strains.
TI  - Immunization with Streptococcus bovis protects against lactic acidosis in sheep.
AB  - Lactic acidosis is a gastrointestinal disorder resulting from the rapid overgrowth of lactic acid-producing bacteria when ruminants are suddenly introduced to grain feed. The present study has investigated the ability of live and killed bacterial vaccines to reduce lactic acidosis in sheep, via a stimulation of specific antibody production against lactic acid-producing bacteria. Forage-fed sheep were immunized with live or killed Streptococcus bovis Sb-5 vaccine, with or without adjuvant, via intramuscular injection. After the primary immunization, three boosters were given at 2-4 week intervals. Sheep were subsequently challenged by a sudden switch to a grain-based diet. Following challenge, vaccinated sheep maintained significantly higher feed intake, and had higher rumen pH, lower L-lactate concentrations, and less severe diarrhoea scores than non-vaccinated control sheep. Higher rumen pH, lower mortality and less severe diarrhoea were found in the animals immunized with live vaccine compared to the animals immunized with killed vaccines. Significant increases in mucosal and systemic antibody responses were observed after boosting; the S. bovis-specific antibody concentrations were significantly higher in samples of saliva, rumen fluid and serum from sheep immunized with live vaccine than with killed vaccines. These results demonstrate that lactic acidosis can be reduced by immunization against S. bovis, and that live Sb-5 vaccine is effective in invoking mucosal as well as systemic antibody responses.
TI  - Immunization with a Streptococcus bovis vaccine administered by different routes  against lactic acidosis in sheep.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis is an important lactic acid bacterium in the rumen, which contributes to the development of lactic acidosis. This study was designed to test the efficacy of immunization with S. bovis primed either intramuscularly (i.m.) or intraperitoneally (i.p. ) against lactic acidosis. Forty-five wethers were allocated to three treatment groups. Two groups were injected with a S. bovis vaccine by either the i.m. or i.p. route for primary immunization; both groups were further immunized by the same route(s) (oral and/or i.m.) for boosters. The third group was not immunized (control). Antibody concentrations were measured in saliva prior to and following animals being fed a grain diet, and also in the rumen fluid, before the animals were suddenly introduced to a grain diet. The average antibody concentration in the animals of the i.m. group was higher than the i.p. group (P< 0.05). The antibody concentration in the rumen fluid of immunized sheep was higher than the control animals (P< 0.01). The difference in the rumen fluid antibody concentration between the i.m. and i.p. groups was not statistically significant (P> 0.05). In the i.m. group, there was a significantly greater feed intake, higher rumen pH, lower diarrhoea scores, and less increase in blood packed cell volume following grain feeding than in the animals of the control group. The severity of diarrhoea and the increase of blood packed cell volume in the animals of the i. p. group were also less than in the animals of the control group. The results suggest that the risk of lactic acidosis can be reduced by immunization against S. bovis, and that the immunization primed i. m. is more effective than the immunization primed i.p.
TI  - Unusual association: Streptococcus bovis tricuspid endocarditis with atrial-septal aneurysm and patent foramen ovale.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis endocarditis is a frequent cause of streptococcal endocarditis and is associated with colonic tumours. The tricuspid valve is very rarely affected and its involvement is a complication which can lead to a less favourable outcome. We report the seventh case of tricuspid valve endocarditis due to S. bovis, and the first, to our knowledge, to be associated with an atrial-septal aneurysm and a patent foramen ovale. The underlying medical conditions and predisposing factors for development of tricuspid valve endocarditis are described and interesting new echocardiographic data are presented. The current guidelines on antibiotic therapy for S. bovis tricuspid valve endocarditis are reviewed.

TI  - Udder health and risk factors for subclinical mastitis in organic dairy farms in  Switzerland.
AB  - 1+ were submitted for somatic cell counting (SCC), bacteriological examination and to test for antibiotic susceptibility. The SCC and germ-cell counts of monthly bulk-tank milk samples were available through Dairy Inspection and Advisory Services and milk production data of 567 herd-book cows were available from breeding associations. Possible individual and environmental predictors of subclinical mastitis were identified using logistic models adjusted for clustering of the data at herd and cow levels. Data were analyzed separately for cows from 7 to 100 and from 101 to 305 days post partum. Prevalences of subclinical mastitis at the quarter level were 21.2% for lactation period 7-100 days and 34.5% for 101-305 days post partum. The geometric mean SCC in bulk-tank milk samples was 85.6x10(3)cells/ml. Samples at 7-100 and 101-305 days post partum were positive for Staphylococcus aureus in 16.0 and 7.4%, for coagulase-negative Staphylococci in 51.5 and 50.6%, for Streptococcus agalactiae in 0.0 and 0.8%, for other Streptococci in 19.4 and 15.6%, for E. coli in 1.0 and 0.4%, and for Corynebacterium bovis in 25.7 and 45.1%, respectively. Risks of subclinical mastitis increased significantly with increasing days post partum and advancing age of cow. Cows that were sampled when staying in alpine dairies had considerably higher risks of subclinical mastitis than cows staying in home barns. Significantly lower risks of subclinical mastitis were observed in farms where CMT was performed regularly as a control measure. Bacteria in milk from cows with mastitis exhibited antibiotic resistance at a comparable frequency as found previously in conventional farms.
TI  - Promotion of intestinal carcinogenesis by Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - The involvement of Streptococcus bovis, an member of the human gut flora, in colorectal neoplastic diseases is an object of controversy. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of S.bovis and of antigens extracted from the bacterial cell wall on early preneoplastic changes in the intestinal tract. Adult rats received i. p. injections of azoxymethane (15 mg/kg body weight) once per week for 2 weeks. Fifteen days (week 4) after the last injection of the carcinogen, the rats received, by gavage twice per week during 5 weeks, either S.bovis (10(10) bacteria) or wall-extracted antigens (100 microg). One week after the last gavage (week 10), we found that administration of either S.bovis or of antigens from this bacterium promoted the progression of preneoplastic lesions through the increased formation of hyperproliferative aberrant colonic crypts, enhanced the expression of proliferation markers and increased the production of IL-8 in the colonic mucosa. Our study suggests that S.bovis acts as a promoter of early preneoplastic lesions in the colon of rats. The fact that bacterial wall proteins are more potent inducers of neoplastic transformation than the intact bacteria may have important implications in colon cancer prevention.
TI  - Protonmotive force regulates the membrane conductance of Streptococcus bovis in a non-ohmic fashion.
AB  - Because the DCCD (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide)-sensitive, F-ATPase-mediated, futile  ATP hydrolysis of non-growing Streptococcus bovis JB1 cells was not affected by sodium or potassium, ATP hydrolysis appeared to be dependent only upon the rate of proton flux across the cell membrane. However, available estimates of bacterial proton conductance were too low to account for the rate of ATP turnover observed in S. bovis. When de-energized cells were subjected to large pH gradients (2.75 units, or -170 mV), internal pH declined at a rate of 0.15 pH units s(-1). Based on an estimated cellular buffering capacity of 200 nmol H+ (mg protein)(-1) per pH unit, H+ flux across the cell membrane (at -170 mV) was 108 mmol (g protein)(-1) h(-1). When potassium-loaded cells were treated with valinomycin in low-potassium buffers, initial K+ efflux generated membrane potentials in close agreement with values predicted by the Nernst equation. These artificial membrane potentials drove H+ uptake, and H+ influx was counterbalanced by a further loss of cellular K+. Flame photometry indicated that the rate of K+ loss was 215 (+/-26) mmol K+ (g protein)(-1) h(-1) at -170 mV, but the potassium-sensitive fluorescent compound CD222 indicated that this rate was only 110 (+/-44) mmol K+ (g protein)(-1) h(-1). As pH gradients or membrane potentials were reduced, the rate of H+ flux declined in a non-ohmic fashion, and all rates were <25 mmol (g protein)(-1) h(-1) at a driving force of -80 mV. Previous estimates of bacterial proton flux were based on low and unphysiological protonmotive forces, and the assumption that H+ influx rate would be ohmic. Rates of H+ influx into S. bovis cells [as high as 9x10(-11) mol H+ (cm membrane)(-2) s(-1)] were similar to rates reported for respiring mitochondria, but were at least 20-fold greater than any rate previously reported in lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Identification and enumeration of oleic acid and linoleic acid hydrating bacteria in the rumen of sheep and cows.
AB  - The diversity and population densities of facultative anaerobic bacteria with the capacity to hydrate oleic acid and linoleic acid in the rumen of sheep and dairy cows were determined. The screening of representative colonies, from rumen fluid plated aerobically on a range of agar media, revealed that sheep rumen fluid contained hydration-positive strains of Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus and Pediococcus, whereas cow rumen fluid contained hydration-positive strains of Streptococcus, Lactobacillus and Staphylococcus. Mean counts of facultative anaerobic bacteria in sheep and cattle rumen were log10 7.29 and log10 6.40, respectively, and were independent of diet. Approximately 56% of facultative anaerobic bacteria were able to hydrate oleic and/or linoleic acid in anaerobic broth culture. For both sheep and cows, the most numerous hydration-positive isolates were strains of Strep. bovis. The results, which are the first to show that pediococci have the capacity to hydrate unsaturated fatty acids, suggest that lactic acid bacteria are the major unsaturated fatty acid hydrating bacteria in the rumen.

AB  - Although Streptococcus equinus has been isolated from the human bowel in an appreciable percentage of the adult general population, it has only rarely been described as a human pathogen. Our report describes the occurrence of S. equinus endocarditis in a patient who had no history of pre-existing heart disease, but who showed evidence of a late-stage pulmonary histiocytosis X. Endocarditis resolved promptly after antibiotic treatment, but required aortic valve substitution. Abnormalities of the immune system that have been demonstrated in patients with histiocytosis X could explain the occurrence of endocarditis in this patient.
TI  - Infective endocarditis in a tertiary-care hospital in southern Israel.
AB  - During the years 1980-1994, 84 patients were treated in our institution due to suspected infective endocarditis (IE). Seventy-one of these episodes occurring in 71 patients, classified definite or possible according to the Duke criteria, were retrospectively analyzed in this study. There were 52 cases of native valve endocarditis, 7 cases of early prosthetic valve endocarditis, and 12 cases of late prosthetic valve endocarditis. The incidence of IE did not change significantly during the study period. The overall mortality rate was 15%. Only one case of drug addiction appeared in our series despite its growing frequency in Israel. Rheumatic heart disease remained the main underlying cardiac condition and Streptococcus viridans remained the most common pathogen. Streptococcus bovis was found to be a significant pathogen causing IE in our patient population, while Staphylococcus aureus appeared to be less frequent. The Duke criteria significantly classified a greater proportion of cases as definitive, as opposed to the von Reyn criteria. Fewer cases were rejected by the Duke criteria, especially culture-negative cases, and those without histopathological confirmation. Application of the Duke criteria permits a more consistent approach to the diagnosis of IE, even in a non-drug-addict patient population.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 Gram-positive microorganisms. The MIC(90) (mg/L) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus anginosus and Actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for Streptococcus sanguis and Listeria monocytogenes, 2 for Corynebacterium jekeium and Bifidobacterium bivius. Over 50% of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, quinolone-resistant staphylococci, Nocardia steroides and Clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/L moxifloxacin. Moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards Gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against Gram-positive bacilli.
TI  - Production of cytokines by monocytes, epithelial and endothelial cells activated  by Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - There are numerous reports documenting the correlation between Streptococcus bovis bacteraemia and endocarditis in conjunction with colonic diseases. The adherence of S. bovis to either buccal or intestinal epithelial cells seems to be the initial process in colonization and subsequent infection of the host, allowing further adhesion of S. bovis to either endothelial cells or extracellular matrix components which leads to infective endocarditis. Bacterial entry at tumour sites is further assisted by the local action of cytokines that promotes vasodilatation and increased capillary permeability. Thus the ability of S. bovis to adhere to and to stimulate human cells may contribute to the pathogenicity of this bacteria. In the present study, we have shown the ability of S. bovis and wall-extracted antigens (WEA) to adhere to human buccal (KB) or intestinal (Caco-2) epithelial cell lines, to human saphenous vein endothelial cells, to human monocytic cell line (THP-1) and to extracellular matrix components (ECM) (fibronectin, collagen and laminin). The fixation of S. bovis on cells was followed by the synthesis of IL-8 from all the cells except Caco-2, whereas S. bovis WEA was able to induce cytokine synthesis from all of them, showing the immunomodulatory effect of S. bovis and S. bovis WEA on different cells.
TI  - Development of molecular methods for identification of Streptococcus bovis from human and ruminal origins.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis has been identified as a causative agent in humans for a variety of diseases, including endocarditis, meningitis, and septicemia. Identification of S. bovis strains of human origin in clinical settings has been problematic due to variations in biochemical tests as compared to ruminal strains of S. bovis, and other streptococcal species. DNA-DNA hybridization with chromosomal DNA from various S. bovis strains indicates that strains of human origin are different from those of ruminal origin. Specific probes have been designed from S. bovis 16S rDNA gene sequences that differentiate strains of human and ruminal origin by direct hybridization and PCR analyses. These techniques now allow for rapid identification of S. bovis strains for clinical and other scientific investigations.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis meningitis in an infant.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis is a nonenterococcal, group D streptococcus which has been identified as a causative agent for serious human infections, including endocarditis, bacteremia, and septic arthritis. Several cases of adult S. bovis meningitis have been reported, usually in association with underlying disease. In the neonatal period, it is an uncommon agent of meningitis. We report, to our knowledge, the third documented case of neonatal S. bovis meningitis in the English language literature. As in the previous cases, this neonate showed no anatomical or congenital immunologic lesion which might be expected to predispose the patient to meningitis. Sequencing of the 16S ribosomal DNA gene was performed and a new PCR test was used to secure a more reliable identification of the strain.
TI  - On the microbiological profile of traditional Portuguese sourdough.
AB  - Traditional manufacture of bread from maize has been noted to play important roles from both economic and social standpoints; however, enforcement of increasingly strict hygiene standards requires thorough knowledge of the adventitious microbiota of the departing dough. To this goal, sourdough as well as maize and rye flours from several geographic locations and in two different periods within the agricultural year were assayed for their microbiota in sequential steps of quantification and identification. More than 400 strains were isolated and taxonomic differentiation between them was via Biomerieux API galleries (375 of which were successfully identified) following preliminary biochemical and morphological screening. The dominant groups were yeasts and lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The most frequently isolated yeasts were Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida pelliculosa. The most frequently isolated LAB were (heterofermentative) Leuconostoc spp. and (homofermentative) Lactobacillus spp.; L. brevis, L. curvatus, and L. lactis ssp. lactis were the dominant species for the Lactobacillus genera; Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis for lactococci; Enterococcus casseliflavus, E. durans, and E. faecium for enterococci; and Streptococcus constellantus and S. equinus for streptococci.
TI  - Lactoferrin concentration in milk of bovine clinical mastitis.
AB  - The lactoferrin (LF) concentration in the milk from dairy cows with clinical mastitis was determined to evaluate the relationship between the LF concentration (LFC) in milk and the non-specific defensive capability of the udder. The mean LFC in 368 milk samples from 319 cows with clinical mastitis was significantly higher (p < 0.01) than that of normal cows. The mean LFC in milk from quarters infected with Mycoplasma bovis or Staphylococcus aureus was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that of quarters infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS). In Escherichia coli mastitis, the level of LFC in milk from cows with peracute mastitis was significantly lower (p < 0.01) than that from cows with acute mastitis. In cases of mastitis due to E. coli, the mean LFC in milk from cows that needed more than 10 days to recover from the mastitis or were not cured was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than that for cows which took less than 10 days to be cured. The mean LFC in milk from cows with peracute E. coli mastitis was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than that for cows with mastitis associated with environmental streptococci or CNS, although these low LF levels were somewhat increased after 46 h from the occurrence of mastitis. These results suggest that the decreased levels of LF in peracute E. coli mastitis may be associated with the progress of inflammation in the early phase of mastitis.
TI  - Identification of aesculin-hydrolyzing streptococci, lactococci, aerococci and enterococci from subclinical intramammary infections in dairy cows.
AB  - Aesculin-hydrolyzing, catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci isolated from subclinical intramammary infections in dairy cows were identified to species level using growth characteristics and biochemical activity. The results indicated that the aesculin-hydrolyzing cocci associated with this type of infection are a very heterogenic group. S. uberis strains, including inulin- or beta-glucuronidase-negative isolates, accounted for only about one-third of the collection, and Enterococcus faecalis strains for one-fifth. Other species of some importance included (in descending order of isolation frequency) Aerococcus viridans, Streptococcus pluranimalium, Lactococcus garvieae, Streptococcus bovis and Streptococcus gallolyticus.
TI  - Molecular and physiological characterization of dominant bacterial populations in traditional mozzarella cheese processing
AB  - The development of the dominant bacterial populations during traditional Mozzarella cheese production was investigated using physiological analyses and molecular techniques for strain typing and taxonomic identification. Analysis of RAPD fingerprints revealed that the dominant bacterial community was composed of 25 different biotypes, and the sequence analysis of 16S rDNA demonstrated that the isolated strains belonged to Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, Leuc. lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Strep. bovis, Strep. uberis, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, L. garviae, Carnobacterium divergens, C. piscicola, Aerococcus viridans, Staphylococcus carnosus, Staph. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. sulphureus and Enterococcus spp. The bacterial populations were characterized for their physiological properties. Two strains, belonging to Strep. thermophilus and L. lactis subsp. lactis, were the most acidifying; theL. lactis subsp. lactis strain was also proteolytic and eight strains were positive to citrate fermentation. Moreover, the molecular techniques allowed the identification of potential pathogens in a non-ripened cheese produced from raw milk.
TI  - Sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria as indicators of diffuse human faecal pollution in estuarine watersheds.
AB  - Sorbitol fermenting bifidobacteria were evaluated as indicators of non-point source human faecal pollution to three sub-estuaries with elevated faecal coliform densities. Human-specific bifidobacteria correlated with identifiable human sanitary deficiencies in feeder streams to estuarine creeks in two of three watersheds examined, one rural and one moderately developed. Sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria were recovered at densities ranging from 1 to 90 colony-forming-units 100 ml-1 in 11 of 258 water samples but were undetected in sediment (n = 68) and scat from resident wildlife (deer, muskrat and raccoon, n = 20). Failure to detect sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria in water samples during the summer months was consistent with laboratory microcosm results showing non-recoverability of Bifidobacterium adolescentis after 5-9 d in membrane-filtered estuarine water at 23 and 30 degrees C, but persistence for 4 weeks at 10 degrees C. Persistence of sewage-derived bifidobacteria in membrane-filtered freshwater at 15 degrees C was also observed. Recovery of sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria was complicated by high background levels of Gram-positive rods and cocci. Use of propionic acid and reduced pH (pH = 5.0), or use of a two-step resuscitation protocol using non-selective and selective media, did not improve recovery. Although human specific bifidobacteria hold promise as indicators of diffuse faecal contamination, methodological constraints now limit its application to situations of gross contamination, or sampling potential sources during environmental conditions conducive to bifid persistence.
TI  - A novel staining method for detecting phytase activity.
AB  - Differential agar media for the detection of microbial phytase activity use the disappearance of precipitated calcium or sodium phytate as an indication of enzyme activity. When this technique was applied to the study of ruminal bacteria, it became apparent that the method was unable to differentiate between phytase activity and acid production. Strong positive reactions (zones of clearing around microbial colonies) observed for acid producing, anaerobic bacteria, such as Streptococcus bovis, were not corroborated by subsequent quantitative assays. Experimentation revealed that acidic solutions generated false positive results on the selected differential medium. Empirical studies undertaken to find a solution to this limitation determined the false positive results could be eliminated through a two step counterstaining treatment (cobalt chloride and ammonium molybdate/ammonium vanadate) which reprecipitates acid solubilized phytate. This report discusses the application of the developed two step counterstaining treatment for the screening of phytase producing ruminal bacteria as well as its use in phytase zymogram assays.
TI  - Epidemiological typing of bovine streptococci by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
AB  - Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to investigate the epidemiology  of streptococcal mastitis in dairy cattle. The most prevalent streptococcal species, Streptococcus uberis (60-80% of streptococcal isolates), was highly heterogeneous, with different cows only rarely sharing the same pulsotype. S. agalactiae was rarely encountered, however all eight isolates from one farm generated identical PFGE profiles, which differed from those of all other isolates examined, confirming cow-to-cow transmission. Fifty-two isolates of S. dysgalactiae from 27 cows on 5 farms generated 6 different profiles. However, on individual farms, only one or two pulsotypes usually predominated. This species is generally regarded as an environmental pathogen but our data suggest that cow-to-cow transmission of S. dysgalactiae may occur. In spite of the variation in PFGE profiles of isolates from different cows, persistent infections in individual cows were usually caused by the same pulsotype of S. uberis or S. dysgalactiae.
TI  - Evaluation of a postmilking teat disinfectant containing a phenolic combination for the prevention of mastitis in lactating dairy cows.
AB  - A trial was conducted for 12 months in a herd of 120 Holstein cows in order to determine the efficacy of a teat disinfectant, which contained a phenolic combination, for the prevention of bovine intramammary infections during lactation. Postmilking teat disinfection was compared to a negative control using a split-udder experimental design. The percentage of quarters newly infected by mastitis pathogens was 45% lower in mammary glands with teats that had been dipped in the experimental teat disinfectant after milking than it was in undipped controls. New infections caused by Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, and Corynebacterium bovis were significantly lower in mammary glands with teats that had been dipped in the experimental teat disinfectant than in undipped controls. No statistical differences in the incidence of clinical mastitis between treatment groups were observed. No irritation or chapping of teats dipped in the experimental teat disinfectant were observed. The results of this study suggest that the experimental teat disinfectant containing a phenolic combination is an effective postmilking teat disinfectant for use in the prevention of new intramammary infections by both contagious and environmental mastitis pathogens.
TI  - Feasibility of using total purines as a marker for ruminal bacteria.
AB  - A procedure for measuring total purine content of mixed ruminal bacteria was adapted for use in the determination of purines in pure cultures of ruminal bacteria. Recovery of adenine and guanine, alone or in mixture, was quite variable. The problem was traced to solubility of the silver salt of adenine in the acid wash solution. When the precipitating solution was used as the wash, recovery of the purines was over 97%. Recovery of a 1:1 mixture of adenine and guanine added to yeast RNA was 100.6+/-3.2%. Purine, protein, and bacterial concentrations were determined for 10 pure cultures of ruminal bacteria: Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, D16f, H10b, and H17c; Fibrobacter succinogenes B21a; Lachnospira multiparus D25e; Lactobacillus lactis ARD26e; Prevotella ruminicola H15a; Ruminococcus albus 7; Ruminococcus flavefaciens B34b; and Streptococcus bovis ARD5d. The CV for the most-probable-number (MPN) assay (bacterial concentrations), purine analysis, and protein analysis were 55.86, 5.25 and 6.52%, respectively. Considerable variation was found among bacterial species and strains when purine and protein concentrations were compared as the amount per individual cell. More consistent values were obtained when these components were expressed on a dry matter basis. Purine:protein ratios for the 10 pure cultures ranged from .023 to .1299, with a mean value of .0883. For samples of mixed bacteria separated from ruminal fluid, this ratio was found to average .0306, which is approximately one-third of the value for the pure cultures. The value determined for the mixed bacterial sample is similar to previously reported values. Based on the ratio obtained with the pure cultures, the microbial protein flow out of the rumen has probably been overestimated in most previous reports. Limited studies suggest that the samples of mixed ruminal bacteria used as a standard are probably contaminated with feed particles containing protein, which results in lower purine:protein ratios.
TI  - Physiological characterization of Streptococcus bovis mutants that can resist 2-deoxyglucose-induced lysis.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis JB1 does not normally lyse, but stationary phase lysis can be induced by including 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) in the growth medium. Isolates deficient in glucose/2DG phosphotransferase activity (PTS-) also lysed when 2DG was present (Lys+) and this result indicated that 2DG phosphorylation via the PTS was not an obligate requirement for 2DG-induced lysis. Cells and cell walls from 2DG-grown cultures lysed faster when proteinase K was added, but glucose-grown cultures and cell walls were not affected. A lipoteichoic acid (LTA) extract (aqueous phase from hot phenol treatment) from glucose-grown cells inhibited the lysis of 2DG-grown cultures, but a similar extract prepared from 2DG-grown cells was without effect. Thin-layer chromatography and differential staining indicated that wild-type and Lys+ PTS- cells incorporated 2DG into LTA, but lysis-resistant cultures (Lys- PTS+ and Lys- PTS-) did not. LTA from lysis-resistant (Lys- PTS+ and Lys- PTS-) cells grown with glucose and 2DG also prevented 2DG-dependent lysis of the wild-type. LTA could not inhibit degradation of cell walls isolated from 2DG-grown cultures, but LTA inhibited the lysis of Micrococcus lysodeikticus (Micrococcus luteus) cells that were exposed to supernatants from 2DG-grown S. bovis cultures. Group D streptococci (including S. bovis) normally have an alpha-1,2 linked glucose disaccharide (kojibiose) in their LTA, but kojibiose cannot be synthesized from 2DG. This observation suggested that the kojibiose moiety of LTA was involved in autolysin inactivation. Wild-type S. bovis had ATP- as well as PEP-dependent mechanisms of 2DG phosphorylation and one lysis-resistant phenotype (Lys- PTS-) had reduced levels of both activities. However, the Lys- PTS+ phenotype was still able to phosphorylate 2DG via ATP and PEP and this result indicated that some other step of 2DG incorporation into LTA was being inhibited. Based on these results, growth in the presence of 2DG appears to prevent synthesis of normal LTA, which is involved in the regulation of autolytic enzymes.
TI  - Immunological cross-reactivity between the vaccine and other isolates of Streptococcus bovis and Lactobacillus.
AB  - Recent studies have showed that immunisation with Streptococcus bovis (Sb-5) and  Lactobacillus (LB-27) may confer protection against lactic acidosis in sheep and cattle. The present study was designed to determine the degree of immunological cross-reactivity between Sb-5 and eight other strains of Streptococcus bovis; and between LB-27 and four other isolates of Lactobacillus. The cross-reactivity index (CRI, a low CRI indicates a high degree of immunological cross-reactivity) ranged from 7.3 to 56.1% between the strains of S. bovis (the encapsulated strains with CRIs ranging from 7.3 to 12.4%). For isolates of Lactobacillus the CRIs ranged from 11.5 to 72.2%. The results indicate that all the isolates tested have a certain degree of immunological homology with Sb-5 and LB-27, and suggest that the vaccine may cross-react with a large number of strains of S. bovis and Lactobacillus which may cause lactic acidosis. As most of the S. bovis strains in the rumen are encapsulated, the high degree of homology between Sb-5 and encapsulated S. bovis strains further suggests that the vaccine containing Sb-5 may be effective against a wide range of strains of S. bovis in sheep and cattle.
TI  - Meningitis caused by streptococci other than Streptococcus pneumoniae: a retrospective clinical study.
AB  - We reviewed the medical records of 26 patients (median age 62 years, range 5-76 years) admitted to our institution during 1978-98 with acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) caused by streptococci other than Streptococcus pneumoniae (comprising 1.9% of all patients with ABM). 19 cases were community-acquired and 7 were nosocomial. 73% had comorbid or predisposing conditions and 73% had an identifiable extracerebral focus; only in 2 patients no comorbid disease, primary focus or predisposing condition was present. Five patients had cerebral abscesses, and 5 had endocarditis. Beta-haemolytic streptococci were grown in 14 cases (serotype A: 4, B: 5, C: 1, G: 4) and were predominant among patients with endocarditis, whereas alpha- or non-haemolytic strains grew in 12 cases (S. mitis: 4, S. constellatus: 2, E. faecalis: 2, S. bovis: 1, unspecified: 3) and were predominant in patients with a brain abscess. Staphylococcus aureus grew together with a streptococcus in 2 cases. Blood culture was positive in 9 cases (35%). Neurologic complications occurred in 11 patients (42%) and extraneurologic complications in 18 patients (69%). Adverse outcomes occurred in 10 patients (38%), including 3 patients who died. Occurrence of seizures at any time of disease was significantly associated with an adverse outcome; no other clinical or paraclinical features appeared to affect outcome.
TI  - Binding of selected extracellular matrix proteins to enterococci and Streptococcus bovis of animal origin.
AB  - Thirty-three enterococcal strains and 10 Streptococcus bovis strains were investigated for their protein-binding cell surface components. Seven extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins were immobilized on Difco latex beads to detect these components on the surface of all enterococcal strains and eight non-autoaggregating S. bovis strains by a particle agglutination assay (PAA). Twenty-three selected strains were also examined in microtiter plate assays. According to the absorbance readings (A(570nm)), 11 strains were classified as nonadherent (A(570nm) < 0.1), 10 strains as weakly adherent (0.1 < A(570nm) > 0.3), and 2 strains as strongly adherent (A(570nm) > 0.3) in these assays. A direct correlation was found between the values obtained in PAA and A(570nm) readings of microtiter plate assays. Binding of (125)I-labeled bovine lactoferrin to enterococci and streptococci was in the range of 6%-30% and of (125)I-labeled human vitronectin in the range of 9%-33% to streptococci. The binding of(125)I-labeled ECM proteins to selected strains was much more effectively inhibited by sulfated carbohydrates than by non-sulfated hyaluronic acid, indicating the importance of the sulfate groups of these inhibitors. An inhibition effect of heparin on bLf binding to four selected strains was higher in comparison with fucoidan in the microtiter plates. Thirty-five out of 44 strains had agglutinated rabbit erythrocytes. However, these strains showed no ability to agglutinate bovine or sheep erythrocytes.
TI  - Natural genetic transformation in the rumen bacterium Streptococcus bovis JB1.
AB  - Natural transformation of Streptococcus bovis JB1 was demonstrated after development of competence in normal culture medium. Transformation efficiencies were not significantly increased when heat-inactivated horse serum was added to the medium before growth. This is the first time that a resident rumen bacterial species has been shown to be naturally transformable. Transformation allowed the acquisition of plasmids or integration of sequences into the chromosome. No transformation was observed in the presence of undiluted autoclaved or filter-sterilised ovine rumen fluid or filter-sterilised ovine saliva, suggesting that transformation in the ruminant digestive tract is a rare event, although transformation was observed in the presence of 1% and 0.5% filter-sterilised rumen fluid. The use of natural transformation of S. bovis should facilitate further molecular biological studies on this species.
TI  - Genetic homogeneity and phage susceptibility of ruminal strains of Streptococcus  bovis isolated in Australia.
AB  - The genetic homogeneity of 37 strains of ruminal streptococci was investigated by comparing DNA fragment profiles on agarose gels following restriction endonuclease digestion with Hae III, Cfo I and Msp I. Thirty strains were indistinguishable from Streptococcus bovis strains, 2B, H24 and AR3. The remaining three strains were similar but not identical to a ruminal strain of Strep. intermedius (AR36). In addition, the susceptibility of these strains to infection by five bacteriophages was examined. Three of the phages (phi Sb02, phi Sb03 and phi Sb04) were specific to the strain of Strep. bovis from which they were isolated, while phages 2BV and phi Sb01 infected one and two strains, respectively, in addition to their primary host. It was concluded that although Strep. bovis is relatively homogeneous genetically, broad host range phages appear to be uncommon with this bacterial species.
TI  - The ability of "low G + C gram-positive" ruminal bacteria to resist monensin and  counteract potassium depletion.
AB  - Gram-negative ruminal bacteria with an outer membrane are generally more resistant to the feed additive, monensin, than Gram-positive species, but some bacteria can adapt and increase their resistance. 16S rRNA sequencing indicates that a variety of ruminal bacteria are found in the "low G + C Gram-positive group," but some of these bacteria are monensin resistant and were previously described as Gram-negative species (e.g., Selenomonas ruminantium and Megasphaera elsdenii). The activity of monensin can be assayed by its ability to cause potassium loss, and results indicated that the amount of monensin needed to catalyze half maximal potassium depletion (K(d)) from low G + C gram-positive ruminal bacteria varied by as much as 130-fold. The K(d) values for Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49, Streptococcus bovis JB1, Clostridium aminophilum F, S. ruminantium HD4, and M. elsdenii B159 were 10, 65, 100, 1020, and 1330 nM monensin, respectively. B. fibrisolvens was very sensitive to monensin, and it did not adapt. S. bovis and C. aminophilum cultures that were transferred repeatedly with sub-lethal doses of monensin had higher K(d) values than unadapted cultures, but the K(d) was always less than 800 nM. S. ruminantium and M. elsdenii cells were highly resistant (K(d) > 1000 nM), and this resistance could be explained by the ability of these low G + C Gram-positive bacteria to synthesize outer membranes.
TI  - Proteolytic activities of the starch-fermenting ruminal bacterium, Streptococcus  bovis.
AB  - The objective of this study was to characterize the extracellular proteolytic activity of Streptococcus bovis. Strains KEG, JB1, NCFB 2476, and K11.21.09.6C produced very similar large molecular weight (160-200 kDa) extracellular proteases that were specifically inhibited by PMSF, a serine protease inhibitor. Further experiments with S. bovis KEG indicated that cultures grown with casein as the sole added N source produced the greatest level of proteolytic activity, and the level of proteolytic activity was independent of growth rate. Clarified ruminal fluid (CRF) decreased proteolytic activity by 54% compared with cultures grown with casein alone, and addition of exogenous peptides and carbohydrates (CHO) to the CRF further reduced the level of proteolytic activity by 44% and 52%, respectively. These results suggested that the proteolytic activity of S. bovis KEG was modulated by available N source and that the proteolytic activity was present for reasons other than providing N for growth. The role of S. bovis in ruminal proteolysis requires further definition, but phenotypic similarity among some ruminal strains would suggest a common niche in ruminal proteolysis. The uniformity of proteolytic activities could make S. bovis a prime candidate for manipulation in ruminal proteolysis control strategies.

TI  - Effect of virginiamycin on ruminal fermentation in cattle during adaptation to a  high concentrate diet and during an induced acidosis.
AB  - The objective of Exp. 1 was to compare the effects of virginiamycin (VM; 0, 175,  or 250 mg x animal(-1) x d(-1)) and monensin/tylosin (MT; 250/ 90 mg x animal(-1) x d(-1)) on ruminal fermentation products and microbial populations in cattle during adaptation to an all-concentrate diet. Four ruminally cannulated, Holstein steers were used in a 4x4 Williams square design with 21-d periods. Steers were stepped up to an all-concentrate diet fed at 2.5% of BW once daily. Ruminal pH, protozoal counts, and NH3-N and VFA concentrations generally were unaffected by VM or MT. Mean counts of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus bovis were lower (P<.05) for VM-treated compared with control or MT-treated steers. Both VM and MT prevented the increase in Fusobacterium necrophorum counts associated with increasing intake of the high-concentrate diet observed in the control. The objective of Exp. 2 was to compare the effects of VM and MT on ruminal pH, L(+) lactate and VFA concentrations, and F. necrophorum numbers during carbohydrate overload. Six ruminally cannulated Holstein steers were assigned randomly to either the control, VM (175 mg/d), or MT (250 + 90 mg/d) treatments. Acidosis was induced with intraruminal administration of a slurry of ground corn and corn starch. The VM and MT premixes were added directly to the slurry before administration. Carbohydrate challenge induced acute ruminal acidosis (pH was 4.36 and L (+) lactate was 19.4 mM) in controls by 36 h. Compared with the controls, steers receiving VM or MT had higher (P<.05) ruminal pH, and the VM group had a lower (P<.05) L (+) lactate concentration. Fusobacterium necrophorum numbers initially increased in VM- and MT-administered steers. In the control steers, F. necrophorum was undetectable by 36 h. Virginiamycin seemed to control the growth of ruminal lactic acid-producing bacteria and, therefore, has the potential to moderate ruminal fermentation in situations that could lead to rapid production of lactic acid.

TI  - Streptococcal meningitis in adult patients: current epidemiology and clinical spectrum.
AB  - Streptococci other than Streptococcus pneumoniae are a rare cause of bacterial meningitis in adults. We report 29 cases of streptococcal meningitis (1977-1997). The patients comprised 19 men and 10 women, with a mean age +/- standard deviation of 47 +/- 18 years. Nine cases were secondary to neurosurgical procedures, seven to brain abscess, five to cerebrospinal fluid pericranial fistula, and three to endocarditis. Causative microorganisms included the following: viridans group streptococci, 20 cases; anaerobic streptococci, 3; Streptococcus agalactiae, 3; Streptococcus bovis, 2; and Streptococcus pyogenes, 1. Four Streptococcus mitis strains showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin (MIC, 0.5-2 microg/mL). Five patients (17%) died. The infection is increasing in the hospital setting. Streptococci resistant to penicillin should be considered in the empirical treatment of nosocomial meningitis. In cases of community-acquired infection, anaerobic streptococci or streptococci of the Streptococcus milleri group should alert the clinician to the presence of an undiagnosed brain abscess, whereas oral streptococci of the viridans group suggest the diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis.
TI  - Use of corticosteroids in glomerulonephritis related to infective endocarditis: three cases and review.
AB  - We report the cases of three patients treated for infective endocarditis (IE) for whom corticosteroids were added to the antibiotic treatment. They all had clinical and biological evidence of immune-mediated glomerulonephritis. The microorganisms responsible for IE were Coxiella burnetii, Streptococcus bovis, and Cardiobacterium hominis. Median duration of IE before antimicrobial therapy was 7 months. In all patients, renal function deteriorated despite appropriate antimicrobial treatment for a mean duration of 16 days, but it improved after addition of corticosteroid therapy. All patients were cured of IE. A literature review revealed four additional cases of IE-related glomerulonephritis in which adjunctive immunosuppressive therapy was considered to be effective. Although corticosteroid therapy is generally not recommended for IE, it should be considered for patients whose renal dysfunction secondary to glomerulonephritis does not improve with appropriate antimicrobial treatment, especially if the duration of the illness is long.

TI  - Immunisation against lactic acidosis in cattle.
AB  - The present study was designed to investigate the efficacy of control of lactic acidosis by immunisation against lactic acid-producing bacteria, Streptococcus bovis and Lactobacillus. Ten steers were allocated to two treatment groups. One group was immunised with a vaccine containing S. bovis (strain Sb-5) and Lactobacillus (LB-27) cells, and the other was a non-immunised control group. The vaccine, using Freund's complete adjuvant for primary immunisation and Freund's incomplete adjuvant for boosters, was administered intramuscularly. After primary immunisation, boosters were given at 2 to 4 week intervals. Both anti- S. bovis and anti- Lactobacillus IgG levels in saliva increased significantly (P < 0.01) after the 1st booster which were lower (P < 0.05) than the IgG levels after the 2nd and 3rd boosters, but were not significantly different (P > 0.05) from the IgG levels prior to a grain challenge (after the 4th booster). There were positive correlations between the anti- S.bovis and anti- Lactobacillus IgG in serum and saliva. Compared with the control group, steers in the immunised group had higher (P < 0.05) feed intakes, lower (P < 0.05) rumen concentrations of lactate and lower numbers of S. bovis and Lactobacillus. Three of the control animals were withdrawn from the grain challenge due to their rumen pH persisting below 5.2, while only one animal in the immunised group was withdrawn. These results suggest that the risk of lactic acidosis can be reduced by immunisation against S. bovis and Lactobacillus.
TI  - Bacteremia complicated by vertebral osteomyelitis due to Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - The diagnosis of vertebral osteomyelitis is easily missed, especially in the elderly in whom clinical signs of bacteremia might not be manifest. Spontaneously occurring disc-space infection in adults often has an insidious presentation. The infecting microorganism can be difficult to identify. Although discitis due to Streptococcus bovis is occasionally found, it is often difficult to fully confirm the diagnosis. Here, a case of vertebral osteomyelitis due to this microorganism is reported.
TI  - Bacterial complications of strongyloidiasis: Streptococcus bovis meningitis.
AB  - We report the case of a 64-year-old veteran who had Streptococcus bovis meningitis as a result of a long latent Strongyloides infection that became acute when he was treated with prednisone. We reviewed 38 reported cases of serious bacterial infections associated with strongyloidiasis. Patients most frequently had nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms. Of these 38 patients, 21 (55%) had meningitis, and 28 (73%) had bacteremia that was polymicrobial in 3 cases (8%). Other sites of infection included lung, bone marrow, ascites, mitral valve, and lymph node. Most infections were due to enteric gram-negative bacteria. There is one previously reported case of S bovis meningitis. Thirty-four of the patients (89%) were immunosuppressed; 21 of these (55%) were taking pharmacologic doses of adrenal corticosteroids. Thirty-three of the 38 (87%) patients died. Patients with enteric bacterial infection without an obvious cause should be tested for the presence of strongyloidiasis.
TI  - [Investigations on the behavior of C-reactive protein, cell count, lactose content as well as electric conductivity in quarter milk samples of subclinically diseased quarters of the udders in relation to bacteriologic results].
AB  - Inflammations of the udder influence the amount of somatic cells and lactose as well as electrical conductivity in milk. They are often caused by bacterial agents. Similar reactions are to be seen in relation to C-reactive protein (CRP). The amount of CRP in milk depends on concentration and characteristics of the agents and the phase of inflammation. We found a significant increase of CRP in milk samples with Streptococcus (Sc.) uberis. There was no significant difference in CRP concentrations in samples with coagulase positive Staphylococcus spp. (CPS) and bacteriological negative samples and such with Corynebacterium (C.) bovis, Micrococcus spp. and Staphylococcus (S.) epidermidis. We only found high correlations to the amount of somatic sells and lactose as well as electrical conductivity in samples with Sc. uberis. The results of our investigations show that CRP may be a parameter for better understanding subclinical inflammations of udder.
TI  - Streptococcus waius sp. nov., a thermophilic Streptococcus from a biofilm.
AB  - Thermophilic streptococci were isolated from biofilms on stainless steel samples  exposed to pasteurized skimmed milk and from dairy products from a dairy manufacturing plant. The phenotypic characters of these isolates were distinct from those of other thermophilic streptococci of dairy origin (Streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus bovis). Genotypic data [restriction endonuclease analysis, ribotyping, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) profiles, DNA-DNA hybridization and G + C contents] support the classification of these isolates as a new species. The sequence of the 16S rRNA was compared with that of 29 species of streptococci and shown to be significantly different. The sequence of the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region also differed from published sequences of closely related species. A fluorescent in situ hybridization probe prepared to a specific part of the 16S rRNA gene sequence was able to distinguish the unknown isolates from reference isolates of S. thermophilus and S. bovis. It is proposed that these thermophilic streptococcal isolates from a dairy environment be classified in the genus Streptococcus as a new species, Streptococcus waius (from waiu, the New Zealand Maori word for milk). The type strain is 3/1T (= NZRCC 20100T).

TI  - Subarachnoid hemorrhage due to septic embolic infarction in infective endocarditis.
AB  - During antibiotic therapy, a 56-year-old man with a Streptococcus bovis endocarditis developed an infarction of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA). Thirty hours after stroke onset, cranial computed tomography controls demonstrated a secondary subarachnoid hemorrhage, marked in the cistern of the right MCA. The latent period, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, angiographic and pathologic findings favor the assumption of a pyogenic arterial wall necrosis of the MCA due to a septic embolus. This pathomechanism of intracranial hemorrhage in infective endocarditis should be distinguished from a rupture of a mycotic aneurysm.
TI  - Structure and transcriptional regulation of the gene encoding pyruvate formate-lyase of a ruminal bacterium, Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - The gene (pfl) encoding pyruvate formate-lyase (Pfl) from Streptococcus bovis was sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of Pfl was similar to Streptococcus mutans Pfl, and included the conserved regions necessary for free-radical formation and a catalytic site. The Pfl of S. bovis appeared to be a free-radical-containing enzyme because of its dioxygen sensitivity and its amino acid sequence similarity with the Escherichia coli enzyme. The pfl mRNA of S. bovis was approximately 2.3 kb and was transcribed in a monocistronic fashion. When cells were grown in batch culture at pH 6.9, the level of pfl transcript increased as the growth phase changed from exponential growth to stationary phase. This result was in constrast to the previous observation that the level of lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh) mRNA decreased during the later stages of growth. Continuous culture experiments conducted at pH 6.9 under glucose-limited and ammonia-limited conditions revealed that pfl mRNA was decreased by an excess supply of glucose, as well as by a high growth rate. On the contrary, ldh mRNA increased when excess glucose was supplied and the growth rate was high. The amount of pfl mRNA in cells was lower at pH 4.5 than pH 6.9, whereas the level of ldh mRNA was higher at pH 4.5. This result was consistent with the amounts of Pfl and Ldh in cells and the proportion of formate and lactate produced. These results support the hypothesis that S. bovis regulates Pfl and Ldh synthesis at the transcriptional level in response to growth conditions.

TI  - GC-MS analysis of diaminopimelic acid stereoisomers and amino acid enantiomers in rumen bacteria.
AB  - The amounts and the configuration of the stereoisomers of 2,6-diaminopimelic acid (Dap) and the enantiomeric content of other amino acids were determined in five individual species (Fibrobacter succinogenes, Streptococcus bovis, Selenomonas ruminantium, Prevotella ruminicola and Anaerovibrio lipolytica) of rumen bacteria, and in samples of mixed rumen bacteria isolated from sheep. The separation and quantification of the Dap stereoisomers was achieved by gas chromatography (GC) of trifluoroacetyl 2-propyl esters on a Chirasil-L-Val fused silica column, and detection was achieved by selected ion monitoring mass spectrometry (SIM-MS). No isomers of Dap were detected in S. bovis and P. ruminicola, two of the bacterial isolates. LL- and DD-Dap were not detected in any of the bacterial samples. As only the meso-isomer of Dap was detected in these microorganisms, it was quantified by adding LL-Dap as an internal standard before the bacteria were acid-hydrolyzed. Amounts of between 4.8 and 12.0 mg meso-Dap per gram of bacterial dry matter (DM) were determined. The presence in the rumen bacteria of free amino acid enantiomers, extractable with 70% aqueous ethanol, were determined by GC-SIM-MS; the D-amino acids were predominantly Ala, Asp and Glu, but there was considerable variation between the species.
TI  - Spectrum and antimicrobial activity of alexomycin (PNU-82, 127), a peptide compound projected for use in animal health.
AB  - Alexomycin (PNU-82, 127) is a thiopeptide antimicrobial complex intended for veterinary practice that belongs to a series of cyclic peptides produced by Streptomyces arginensis. MICs against selected routine and fastidious clinical isolates of animal and human origin were determined by broth microdilution or agar dilution reference methods. Alexomycin was active against Gram-positive pathogens such as oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (260 strains; MIC90, 0.5 microgram/mL), as well as Enterococcus species (95 strains; MIC90, 0.25 to 0.5 microgram/mL), and generally inactive against Gram-negative aerobes. Alexomycin had more potent activity against Streptococcus bovis (MIC90, 0.12 microgram/mL), S. agalactiae (MIC90, 0.12 microgram/mL), Corynebacterium species (MIC90, 0.06-0.12 microgram/mL), and Listeria monocytogenes (MIC90, 0.5 microgram/mL). Alexomycin activity was limited against Bacillus species (MIC90, 1 microgram/mL), Neisseria meningiditis (MIC90, 2 micrograms/mL), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, 8 micrograms/mL), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 16 micrograms/mL), and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC90, 32 micrograms/mL). This thiopeptide complex was also found to be stable at low concentrations (0.015-32 micrograms/mL) in Mueller-Hinton broth for up to 24 h, possesses static antimicrobial activity and did not produce resistant mutants after multiple passages at subinhibitory drug concentrations. Alexomycin seems to have potential for use as a feed additive to increase feed efficiency and promote growth in poultry and swine as well as other applications against Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Overwhelming Streptococcus bovis infection as a cause of intrauterine death.
AB  
TI  - Pacemaker-related endocarditis. Report of 7 cases and review of the literature.
AB  - We report on 7 patients with pacemaker endocarditis diagnosed during the workup of long-standing fever. Persistent positive blood cultures and echocardiography led to the diagnosis in 6 patients whereas autopsy was diagnostic in another. Causative microorganisms were Staphylococcus epidermidis (3), Staphylococcus lugdunensis (1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), Streptococcus bovis (1), and Streptococcus mitis-Streptococcus sanguis (1). Pulmonary embolism was present in nearly 50% of the cases, a figure clearly higher than previously reported. In all but 1 case the initial medical approach was not successful, and thus the pacing system was finally removed. None of the cases relapsed after the removal. We have reviewed the literature regarding pacemaker endocarditis, particularly with respect to treatment.
TI  - Ultrastructure of surface components of Streptococcus gallolytics (S. bovis) strains of differing virulence isolated from pigeons.
AB  - Virulence of Streptococcus gallolyticus (S. bovis) strains isolated from pigeons  is associated with the presence of the extracellular proteins A, T1, T2 and T3. Based on the presence or absence of these proteins, six supernatant-phenotypes are distinguished. Experimental infection studies have indicated that strains belonging to the A-T1, A+T1, A+T2 and A+T3 groups are highly virulent for pigeons, strains belonging to the A-T3 groups are moderately virulent and A-T2 strains are of low virulence. In this study the surface structure of 15 pigeon S. gallolyticus strains representing high, moderate and low virulence supernatant-phenotypes was examined by electron microscopy. The presence of capsular material was determined by transmission electron microscopy after polycationic ferritin labelling and immunostabilization. Capsules from cells labelled with polycationic ferritin were usually thicker than those from cells exposed to antiserum. The capsule of the virulent strains had a regular, continuous appearance whilst irregularity of the capsule was a characteristic of the low virulence A-T2 strains. Negative staining revealed the presence of fimbriae in all strains belonging to the high virulence A-T1, A+T1, A+T2 and A+T3 supernatant groups and in one strain of the moderately virulent A-T3 group. The fimbriae were thin, flexible structures with a diameter of approximately 3-4 nm and a length of up to 700 nm. Fimbriae as described above were absent in two other A-T3 strains examined and in the low virulence A-T2 strains. Results from this study indicate that morphological differences in surface structure exist among virulent and low virulence pigeon S. gallolyticus strains, and that the capsule and/or fimbriae are possibly involved in virulence.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of SCH27899 (Ziracin), a novel everninomicin derivative, tested against Streptococcus spp.: disk diffusion/etest method evaluations and quality control guidelines. The Quality Control Study Group.
AB  - To combat the increasing rates of penicillin resistance among pneumococci and viridans group streptococci, new Gram-positive active agents are needed to avoid the overuse of vancomycin. SCH27899 is an everninomicin derivative with strong activity against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, and penicillin-resistant streptococci. This study tests the in vitro activity of SCH27899 against 304 strains of streptococci and evaluates the quality of the agar dilution, broth microdilution, disk diffusion, and Etest methods for this antimicrobial agent. Quality-control (QC) ranges for SCH27899 are also proposed. SCH27899 broth microdilution MICs among the penicillin-susceptible and -resistant streptococci tested ranged from < or = 0.008-0.5 microgram/mL. Organism groups with their respective MIC90s were as follows: Streptococcus pneumoniae (100 strains) and beta-haemolytic streptococci (70 strains), 0.12 microgram/mL; Streptococcus bovis (10 strains), 0.25 microgram/mL; and viridans group streptococci (124 strains), 0.5 microgram/mL. Etest SCH27899 MICs correlated well with broth microdilution MICs (92% +/- one log2 dilution, 98% +/- two log2 dilutions). Agar dilution SCH27899 MICs correlated well with broth microdilution MICs, but a shift toward slightly higher agar dilution MICs was attributed to difficulties in reading trailing endpoints with this method. Three concentrations (2.5, 5, and 10 micrograms) of SCH27899 were used for the disk diffusion method with small inhibition zone diameters (range, 11 to 19 mm) and limited variation between diameters (+/- 2 mm) as a result, both products of this compound's high molecular weight and poor diffusion through agar mediums. Proposed control ranges for SCH27899 when testing S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 from a nine-center (30 tests per center) quality-control trial are < or = 0.016 to 0.032 microgram/mL for Etest, and 0.008 to 0.032 microgram/mL for broth microdilution tests from an earlier study. Because of the limited diffusion ability and bacteriostatic nature of SCH27899, MICs should be read at 80% of inhibition with agar in vitro systems (Etest, agar dilution), and the disk diffusion method is not recommended.
TI  - A case of Streptococcus bovis bacteremia and endocarditis.
AB  
TI  - Streptococcus bovis clone causing two episodes of endocarditis 8 years apart.
AB  - A patient had endocarditis caused by Streptococcus bovis twice 8 years apart. According to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) the two isolates were identical. Seven unrelated blood isolates of S. bovis yielded unique PFGE patterns. Considering this heterogeneous population structure our findings demonstrate the long-term persistence of an S. bovis clone in a patient with recurrent endocarditis.
TI  - [Streptococcus bovis endocarditis and colonic involvement].
AB  - McNeal and Blevins published the first report of Streptococcus bovis infective endocarditis in 1945. In 1951, McCoy suggested, for the first time, that an association could exist between Group D Streptococcus infective endocarditis and colon carcinoma; this association would be demonstrated later (1977) by Klein and unquestionably confirmed by several posterior works. Due to a clinical case of Streptococcus bovis infective endocarditis, which we had the opportunity of diagnosing, a review is made of the existent literature about the association between infection by this agent and the presence of lesions in the colon. Some recommendations are made in what respects the diagnosis and evaluation of patients with Streptococcus bovis infective endocarditis. Finally, the implications and therapeutic strategies in these patients are discussed.

TI  - Manipulation of ruminal fermentation with organic acids: a review.
AB  - The dicarboxylic acids aspartate, fumarate, and malate stimulate lactate utilization by the predominant ruminal bacterium, Selenomonas ruminantium. Malate stimulates lactate uptake by S. ruminantium more than does aspartate or fumarate, and it seems that malate and sodium are involved in stimulating lactate utilization by this bacterium. Based on the ability of S. ruminantium to grow on malate in the presence of extracellular hydrogen and produce succinate, malate may be acting as an electron sink for hydrogen in the succinate-propionate pathway used by S. ruminantium. Incorporation of DL-malate into soluble starch and cracked corn fermentations with mixed ruminal microorganisms changed final pH, CH4, and VFA in a manner analogous to ionophore effects. When compared with either dicarboxylic acids or monensin alone, dicarboxylic acid plus monensin addition to cracked corn incubations stimulated the mixed ruminal microorganism fermentation to produce more propionate, less lactate, and increased final pH. Reduced lactate concentrations in dicarboxylic acid- and monensin-treated incubations most likely represents an additive effect of decreased lactate production by monensin-sensitive bacteria (i.e., Streptococcus bovis) and increased lactate utilization by the monensin-resistant S. ruminantium. The inclusion of malate as a feed additive into the diets of ruminants is currently not economically feasible; however, forages rich in organic acids might serve as vehicles for providing malate to ruminants. When five alfalfa varieties and three bermudagrass hay varieties were surveyed for malate content, the concentration of malate in both plant species declined as maturity increased. However, after 42 d of maturity, the concentration of malate in both forages ranged between 1.9 and 4.5% of the DM. These results suggest that the incorporation of forage varieties that are high in malate may include malate economically into the diet and reduce losses associated with ruminal acidosis.
TI  - A bacteriocin-mediated antagonism by Enterococcus faecium BC25 against ruminal Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - A bacteriocin-like activity produced by Enterococcus faecium BC25, isolated from  the the rumen of a cow, was partially purified and characterized. The active substance was prepared by ammonium sulfate and chloroform/methanol precipitation of culture supernatant. The bacteriocin was a protein of molecular mass 17.5 kDa. Activity was inactivated by trypsin and proteinase K. The bacteriocin BC25 inhibited growth of amylolytic ruminal strains of Streptococcus bovis, including S. bovis AO 24/85. Results showed that bacteriocine substance BC25 has a bacteriostatic effect when present in concentrations exceeding 125 AU/ml. Agar overlays and batch culture growth experiments proved that E. faecium BC25 was producing bacteriocin that inhibited the growth of S. bovis.
TI  - Clinical and morphological characteristics in Streptococcus bovis endocarditis: a comparison with other causative microorganisms in 177 cases.
AB  - AIM: To compare the clinical and morphological characteristics of patients with Streptococcus bovis endocarditis with those of patients with endocarditis caused by other microorganisms. METHODS: 177 consecutive patients (Streptococcus bovis, 22; other streptococci, 94; staphylococci, 44; other, 17) with definite infective endocarditis according to the Duke criteria were included. All patients underwent transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiography. In 88 patients, findings from surgery/necropsy were obtained. RESULTS: S bovis endocarditis was associated with older patients, with a higher mortality (p = 0.04), and with a higher rate of cardiac surgery (p < 0.001) than other microorganisms, although embolic events were observed less often (p = 0.02). Pathological gastrointestinal lesions were detected in 45% of the patients. Multiple valves were affected in 68% of the patients with S bovis endocarditis and in 20% of those with other organisms (p < 0.001). Moderate or severe regurgitation occurred more often in S bovis endocarditis than with other microorganisms (p = 0.05). When surgery or necropsy was performed, infectious myocardial infiltration of the left ventricle was confirmed histopathologically in 36% of the patients with S bovis endocarditis and in 10% of those with other organisms (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: S bovis endocarditis is a severe illness because of the more common involvement of multiple valves, and of the frequent occurrence of haemodynamically relevant valvar regurgitation and infectious myocardial infiltration.
TI  - Hydration of linoleic acid by bacteria isolated from ruminants.
AB  - Two strains of Enterococcus faecalis isolated from the ovine rumen and known to hydrate oleic acid were shown to transform linoleic acid by hydration into two products. The products, identified as 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid and 13-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid, were formed during stationary phase in yields of 13% and 6% respectively. Yields increased to 22% and 14% when culture conditions were optimised. To our knowledge, this is the first report of 13-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid production by bacteria. During a search for further linoleic-acid-hydrating bacteria, a strain of Streptococcus bovis isolated from bovine faeces and the ruminal strain S. bovis JB1 were found to hydrate linoleic acid. Both strains formed only one product and the most rapid appearance occurred during exponential growth. The S. bovis product, identified as 13-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid, formed in a yield of 28%. This study provides the first information on linoleic acid hydration by ruminal bacteria.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis bacteremia: unusual complications.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis bacteremia is known to be related to neoplastic lesions of the colon. We describe a patient with several complications of S bovis bacteremia and adenocarcinoma of the colon--endocarditis, spondylodiskitis, and splenic abscess. We believe this is the eighth known case of endocarditis and diskitis caused by S bovis and the third case of endocarditis and splenic abscess by S bovis in a patient with adenocarcinoma of the colon.
TI  - [Streptococcus bovis endocarditis. Clinical and microbiological observations and  review of the literature].
AB  - Fourteen patients (11 men and 3 women) with Streptococcus bovis infective endocarditis have been observed by the Infectious Disease Section of our Department of Clinical Medicine between the years 1988-1998. The mean age was 63.2 years (range 35-85 years); 5 patients previously suffered valvular disease or had a valvular prosthesis, the infection involved the mitral valve in 6 patients, the aortic in 8, the prosthetic valve in 1. No patient developed cardiac failure or died during hospitalization; only 1 episode of major embolism (spleen) was observed. No patient required cardiac surgery. All patients became afebrile after starting antibiotic treatment; no cases of Streptococcus bovis relapse have been observed, during a six-month follow-up after antibiotics discontinuation, in 13 patients fully evaluated. The remaining patient was lost to follow-up. An underlying asymptomatic colonic neoplasm was diagnosed at colonoscopy in 7 of 11 evaluated patients. This study confirms that Streptococcus bovis infective endocarditis is relatively benign, but it stresses the frequency and potential severity of the associated colonic lesions, requiring colonoscopy and making the treatment of high risk lesion mandatory.
TI  - Differentiation between Streptococcus gallolyticus strains of human clinical and  veterinary origins and Streptococcus bovis strains from the intestinal tracts of ruminants.
AB  - Strains formerly identified as Streptococcus bovis were allotted to two groups by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of whole-cell proteins. Strains from humans with infections, mostly patients with endocarditis, and strains from pigeons with septicemia clustered with the recently described species Streptococcus gallolyticus. The original S. bovis type strain and strains exclusively from ruminants formed the second cluster. The findings indicate that S. gallolyticus is more likely to be involved in human and animal infections than S. bovis. Growth characteristics and several biochemical reactions were found to be useful in the differentiation of S. gallolyticus from S. bovis.
TI  - Effects of laidlomycin propionate and monensin on glucose utilization and nutrient transport by Streptococcus bovis and Selenomonas ruminantium.
AB  - The objective of this study was to compare the effects of laidlomycin propionate  and monensin on cell growth, glucose fermentation, and glucose uptake in Streptococcus bovis strain JB1 and Selenomonas ruminantium strain HD4. Experiments were also conducted to compare the effects of both ionophores on sodium-dependent serine transport and cell yield in S. bovis. Batch cultures (500 mL) of each bacterium were grown on 3.6 g/L D-glucose in semidefined medium and treated with either 5 ppm monensin or 2 ppm laidlomycin propionate (n=2). Cell growth was monitored by measuring optical density at 600 nm (OD600). Glucose and L-lactate concentrations were measured using coupled enzyme assays. In S. bovis, both monensin and laidlomycin propionate decreased OD600, glucose utilization, and L-lactate production. Neither ionophore had any effect on glucose utilization by S. ruminantium. [14C]Glucose uptake between 5 and 30 min by both bacteria was not altered by either ionophore. Sodium-dependent [14C]serine uptake by S. bovis was inhibited by monensin but not laidlomycin propionate. When S. bovis was grown in glucose-limited continuous culture (dilution rate=.10 h(-1)) at extracellular pH 6.7, increasing concentrations of both ionophores decreased bacterial yield, and both ionophores were more potent at an extracellular pH of 5.7. However, monensin was a more potent inhibitor than laidlomycin propionate at pH 6.7 and 5.7. Collectively, these results suggest that the ionophore laidlomycin propionate inhibits the Gram-positive bacterium S. bovis in a manner similar to that of monensin, but, at the concentrations used in this study, laidlomycin propionate seems to be less potent than monensin in inhibiting serine uptake and cell yield.
TI  - Speciation of presumptive viridans streptococci from early onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  - Twenty isolates resembling viridans streptococci, 16 from blood and four from gastric aspirates, from 17 cases of early onset neonatal sepsis were identified by the API20 Strep, Rapid ID 32 Strep and conventional tests plus hydrolysis of methylumbelliferyl glycoside substrates. Nineteen of the isolates were identified as species of viridans streptococci and one as a Leuconostoc sp. Ten of the isolates were Streptococcus oralis, three S. mitis biotype 1, two S. mitis biotype 2 and one each of S. sanguis, S. vestibularis, S. salivarius and S. intermedius. The Rapid ID 32 Strep and conventional plus methylumbelliferyl tests gave the same species identity for 17 of the isolates. S. intermedius was identified by the Rapid ID 32 Strep as S. constellatus and S. salivarius as S. equinus, with S. salivarius at lower probability. The API20 Strep failed to identify S. vestibularis and identified S. salivarius as S. defectivus. The absence of certain critical tests, including urea hydrolysis, does not allow the API20 Strep to identify all the currently recognised species of viridans steptococci. The species distribution was unexpected and the incidence of S. oralis and other viridans streptococci in vaginal swabs from prenatal patients is being investigated further.
TI  - [The microbiology of infectious endocarditis].
AB  - If streptococci and staphylococci remain the main bacteria responsible for infective endocarditis (80%), the emergence of Streptococcus bovis associated with intestinal lesions, the confirmation of the role of Coxiella burnetii, and the discovery of the responsibility of Bartonella sp in case of negative blood culture endocarditis have been the principal microbiological modifications during the last few years. Blood cultures performed under the best technical conditions and the examination and culture of the valve after surgery remain the better means for diagnosing infective endocarditis. In case of negative blood culture (11% of the infective endocarditis), the serologic tests against C. burnetii and Bartonella should decrease the rate of diagnostic uncertainty. The development of bacteriological techniques, particularly molecular methods, should improve the microbiology of infective endocarditis lead to the discovery new aetiological agents.
TI  - [Infectious endocarditis on permanent endocavitary stimulation leads: apropos of  2 cases].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Permanent endocavitary pacemaker lead infectious endocarditis is rare. Two new cases are reported. CASE REPORTS: The first case appeared in a 63-year-old white woman with a permanent endocavitary pacemaker for 3 years. It was caused by Streptococcus bovis, unique to this pathology. The second case was caused by Streptococcus epidermidis in a diabetic 72-year-old woman. In these two cases, the clues to the diagnosis were hemocultures and transesophageal echocardiography. CONCLUSION: These two cases emphasize the importance of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for diagnosis and for driving treatment. Treatment is based on appropriate antibiotics and pacemaker removal. In the second, case, the material was surgically removed under cardiopulmonary bypass because of the size of the infection.
TI  - A prospective controlled study of the association of Streptococcus bovis with colorectal carcinoma.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the ability of Streptococcus bovis to colonise colorectal cancers. PATIENTS: 19 patients with colorectal cancer and 23 controls without malignancy. SETTING: University teaching hospital. METHODS: Prospective study comparing unselected patients with known colorectal cancer with age and sex matched controls. Carcinoma tissue from patients with colorectal cancer and normal colonic mucosa, stool, and blood from both patients and control subjects were cultured. RESULTS: In contrast to published data, the faecal carriage rate was similar in cancer (11%) and control groups (13%). CONCLUSIONS: Faecal colonisation by Str bovis in colorectal cancer patients is lower than previously reported and does not differ significantly from controls.
TI  - Phenotypic and phylogenetic characterization of ruminal tannin-tolerant bacteria.
AB  - The 16S rRNA sequences and selected phenotypic characteristics were determined for six recently isolated bacteria that can tolerate high levels of hydrolyzable and condensed tannins. Bacteria were isolated from the ruminal contents of animals in different geographic locations, including Sardinian sheep (Ovis aries), Honduran and Colombian goats (Capra hircus), white-tail deer (Odocoileus virginianus) from upstate New York, and Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) from Oregon. Nearly complete sequences of the small-subunit rRNA genes, which were obtained by PCR amplification, cloning, and sequencing, were used for phylogenetic characterization. Comparisons of the 16S rRNA of the six isolates showed that four of the isolates were members of the genus Streptococcus and were most closely related to ruminal strains of Streptococcus bovis and the recently described organism Streptococcus gallolyticus. One of the other isolates, a gram-positive rod, clustered with the clostridia in the low-G+C-content group of gram-positive bacteria. The sixth isolate, a gram-negative rod, was a member of the family Enterobacteriaceae in the gamma subdivision of the class Proteobacteria. None of the 16S rRNA sequences of the tannin-tolerant bacteria examined was identical to the sequence of any previously described microorganism or to the sequence of any of the other organisms examined in this study. Three phylogenetically distinct groups of ruminal bacteria were isolated from four species of ruminants in Europe, North America, and South America. The presence of tannin-tolerant bacteria is not restricted by climate, geography, or host animal, although attempts to isolate tannin-tolerant bacteria from cows on low-tannin diets failed.
TI  - Bacterial endocarditis associated with crescentic glomerulonephritis in a kidney  transplant patient: first case report.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endocarditis-induced crescentic glomerulonephritis is a well-described complication in nontransplant patients. Its occurrence in transplant patients has not been reported to date. METHODS: A 50-year-old man who had received a renal allograft 13 years before and been treated with prednisone, 10 mg/day, was admitted for progressive renal failure, purpura, edema of the lower limbs, and fever. RESULTS: Blood cultures isolated Streptococcus bovis and cardiac ultrasound examination revealed a 23-mm-large vegetation on the mitral valve. His plasma creatinine level was 478 micromol/L and his proteinuria was 5.5 g/day. A renal biopsy showed diffuse crescentic glomerulonephritis. Long-term antibiotic treatment and three methylprednisolone pulses were effective in treating the endocarditis and glomerulonephritis. CONCLUSION: Endocarditis-induced glomerulonephritis is an immune-mediated disease that can also occur on a renal allograft. It is likely that a low daily dose of immunosuppressive treatment may have been a facilitating factor.
TI  - Identification of streptococci from Greek Kasseri cheese and description of Streptococcus macedonicus sp. nov.
AB  - Taxonomic studies were performed on some Streptococcus-like organisms isolated from naturally fermented Greek Kasseri cheese. By SDS-PAGE analysis of whole-cell proteins the group was found to be quite different from Streptococcus thermophilus. Comparative 16S and 23S rRNA sequence analyses showed that the isolates represent a new species within the genus Streptococcus, where they are most closely related to the Streptococcus bovis cluster. On the basis of these phylogenetic results and some phenotypic differences, a new species, Streptococcus macedonicus, is proposed. The type strain is ACA-DC 206.
TI  - Intracellular alpha-amylase of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Sequencing upstream of the Streptococcus mutans gene for a CcpA gene homolog, regM, revealed an open reading frame, named amy, with homology to genes encoding alpha-amylases. The deduced amino acid sequence showed a strong similarity (60% amino acid identity) to the intracellular alpha-amylase of Streptococcus bovis and, in common with this enzyme, lacked a signal sequence. Amylase activity was found only in S. mutans cell extracts, with no activity detected in culture supernatants. Inactivation of amy by insertion of an antibiotic resistance marker confirmed that S. mutans has a single alpha-amylase activity. The amylase activity was induced by maltose but not by starch, and no acid was produced from starch. S. mutans can, however, transport limit dextrins and maltooligosaccharides generated by salivary amylase, but inactivation of amy did not affect growth on these substrates or acid production. The amylase digested the glycogen-like intracellular polysaccharide (IPS) purified from S. mutans, but the amy mutant was able to digest and produce acid from IPS; thus, amylase does not appear to be essential for IPS breakdown. However, when grown on excess maltose, the amy mutant produced nearly threefold the amount of IPS produced by the parent strain. The role of Amy has not been established, but Amy appears to be important in the accumulation of IPS in S. mutans grown on maltose.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and efficacy of amoxycillin in the treatment of an experimental  Streptococcus bovis infection in racing pigeons (Columba livia).
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of amoxycillin in pigeons (Columba livia) and the efficacy of amoxycillin treatment in pigeon streptococcosis, were investigated. After intravenous administration of 150 mg.kg-1 amoxycillin, the drug plasma concentration-time profile fitted an open two-compartment model. Amoxycillin was quickly cleared from the circulation with a mean half-life of 66 min and showed a distribution volume of 0.9 L.kg-1. The absolute oral bioavailability of amoxycillin was 50.1%. A 5-day drinking water treatment with amoxycillin (1500 mg.L-1, corresponding to 112.0 mg.kg-1.day-1 during day-light hours) significantly reduced the postinoculation morbidity in pigeons experimentally infected with Streptococcus bovis, compared to untreated infected controls.
TI  - Strategies that ruminal bacteria use to handle excess carbohydrate.
AB  - When ruminal bacteria have insufficient nitrogen and other nutrients, excess carbohydrate can be toxic. Pure cultures that are nitrogen-limited can convert only some of the excess carbohydrate to intracellular polysaccharide, but this pool can be quickly saturated. Fibrobacter succinogenes cultures that have excess cellobiose secrete glucose and cellotriose into the culture medium, and Prevotella ruminicola produces methylglyoxal, a highly toxic substance that causes a dramatic decrease in viability. Some ruminal bacteria (e.g., Streptococcus bovis and Selenomonas ruminantium) have mechanisms to decrease ATP production or spill the ATP that has already been produced. These mechanisms of decreasing intracellular ATP seem to protect the cell. Most ruminal bacteria can use ammonia as a nitrogen source, but amino nitrogen increases the growth efficiency of mixed ruminal bacteria. Amino nitrogen-dependent improvements in growth efficiency can be explained by an increase in growth rate and a decrease in energy spilling. Amino nitrogen is only beneficial if the rate of carbohydrate fermentation is rapid and carbohydrate is in excess.
TI  - De novo synthesis of amino acids by the ruminal bacteria Prevotella bryantii B14, Selenomonas ruminantium HD4, and Streptococcus bovis ES1.
AB  - The influence of peptides and amino acids on ammonia assimilation and de novo synthesis of amino acids by three predominant noncellulolytic species of ruminal bacteria, Prevotella bryantii B14, Selenomonas ruminantium HD4, and Streptococcus bovis ES1, was determined by growing these bacteria in media containing 15NH4Cl and various additions of pancreatic hydrolysates of casein (peptides) or amino acids. The proportion of cell N and amino acids formed de novo decreased as the concentration of peptides increased. At high concentrations of peptides (10 and 30 g/liter), the incorporation of ammonia accounted for less than 0.16 of bacterial amino acid N and less than 0.30 of total N. At 1 g/liter, which is more similar to peptide concentrations found in the rumen, 0.68, 0.87, and 0.46 of bacterial amino acid N and 0.83, 0.89, and 0.64 of total N were derived from ammonia by P. bryantii, S. ruminantium, and S. bovis, respectively. Concentration-dependent responses were also obtained with amino acids. No individual amino acid was exhausted in any incubation medium. For cultures of P. bryantii, peptides were incorporated and stimulated growth more effectively than amino acids, while cultures of the other species showed no preference for peptides or amino acids. Apparent growth yields increased by between 8 and 57%, depending on the species, when 1 g of peptides or amino acids per liter was added to the medium. Proline synthesis was greatly decreased when peptides or amino acids were added to the medium, while glutamate and aspartate were enriched to a greater extent than other amino acids under all conditions. Thus, the proportion of bacterial protein formed de novo in noncellulolytic ruminal bacteria varies according to species and the form and identity of the amino acid and in a concentration-dependent manner.
TI  - Correlation between quinolone susceptibility patterns and sequences in the A and  B subunits of DNA gyrase in mycobacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activities of seven quinolones and the sequences of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDR) in the A and B subunits of DNA gyrase were determined for 14 mycobacterial species. On the basis of quinolone activity, quinolones were arranged from that with the greatest to that with the least activity as follows: sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, flumequine, and nalidixic acid. Based on MICs, the species could be organized into three groups: resistant (Mycobacterium avium, M. intracellulare, M. marinum, M. chelonae, M. abscessus [ofloxacin MICs, >/=8 microg/ml]), moderately susceptible (M. tuberculosis, M. bovis BCG, M. kansasii, M. leprae, M. fortuitum third biovariant, M. smegmatis [ofloxacin MICs, 0.5 to 1 microg/ml]), and susceptible (M. fortuitum, M. peregrinum, M. aurum [ofloxacin MICs, </=0.25 microg/ml]). Peptide sequences of the QRDR of GyrB were identical in all the species, including the amino acids at the three positions known to be involved in acquired resistance to quinolone, i.e., 426 (Asp), 447 (Arg), and 464 (Asn) (numbering system used for Escherichia coli). The last two residues could be involved in the overall low level of susceptibility of mycobacteria to quinolones since they differ from those found in the very susceptible E. coli (Lys-447 and Ser-464) but are identical to those found in the less susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Peptide sequences of the QRDR of GyrA were identical in all the species, except for the amino acid at position 83, which was an alanine in the two less susceptible groups and a serine in the most susceptible one, as in E. coli, suggesting that this amino acid is involved in the observed differences of quinolone susceptibility within the Mycobacterium genus.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis and its association with bowel cancer.
AB  
TI  - The diversion of lactose carbon through the tagatose pathway reduces the intracellular fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and growth rate of Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - Twenty strains of Streptococcus bovis grew more slowly on lactose (1.21 +/- 0.12  h-1) then than on glucose (1.67 +/- 0.12 h-1), and repeated transfers or prolonged growth in continuous culture (more than 200 generations each) did not enhance the growth rate on lactose. Lactose transport activity was poorly correlated with growth rate, and slow growth could not be explained by the ATP production rate (catabolic rate). Batch cultures growing on lactose always had less intracellular fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Frul,6P2) than cells growing on glucose (6.6 mM compared to 16.7 mM), and this difference could be explained by the pathway of carbon metabolism. Glucose and the glucose moiety of lactose were metabolized by the Embden-Meyerhoff-Parnas (EMP) pathway, but the galactose moiety of lactose was catabolized by the tagatose pathway, a scheme that by-passed Frul,6P2. A mutant capable of co-metabolizing lactose and glucose grew more rapidly when glucose was added, even though the total rate of hexose fermentation did not change. Wild-type S. bovis grew rapidly with galactose and melibiose, but these galactose-containing sugars were activated by galactokinase and catabolized via EMP. On the basis of these results, rapid glycolytic flux through the EMP pathway is needed for the rapid growth (more than 1.2 h-1) of S. bovis.
TI  - A method for the selective enumeration and isolation of ruminal Lactobacillus and Streptococcus.
AB  - Ruminal lactic acid-producing bacteria were selectively isolated and enumerated using a one hour aerobic exposure prior to incubation on a semi-selective Lactobacillus medium, MRS, under anaerobic conditions. The technique allowed growth of pure cultures of ruminal Lactobacillus spp. and Streptococcus bovis without supporting the growth of pure cultures of any of the prominent ruminal bacterial species. In mixed cultures, the one hour aerobic pre-incubation inhibited the growth of the obligate anaerobic ruminal bacteria which can otherwise grow on the MRS medium, and the subsequent anaerobic incubation permitted maximal recovery of the weakly aerotolerant ruminal lactic acid-producing Lactobacillus spp. and Streptococcus spp. The efficacy of this technique in selecting exclusively for the lactic acid-producing bacteria was also demonstrated from populations of rumen bacteria from mixed culture end-point in vitro fermentation, continuous in vitro culture and isolations from fresh ruminal samples.
TI  - Effects of chlorhexidine diacetate on ruminal microorganisms.
AB  - The objectives of this study were to examine the effects of chlorhexidine diacetate on growth and L-lactate production by Streptococcus bovis JB1 as well as the effects of this antimicrobial compound on the mixed ruminal microorganism fermentation. Addition of 1.8 microM chlorhexidine diacetate to glucose medium resulted in a lag in growth by S. bovis JB1, and growth was completely inhibited in the presence of 3.6, 9.0, and 18 microM chlorhexidine. When 6.2 microM chlorhexidine diacetate was added to glucose medium after 2 h of incubation, glucose utilization and L-lactate production by S. bovis JB1 were reduced. Phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of 14C-glucose by toluene-treated cells of S. bovis JB1 was inhibited by increasing concentrations (1.8 to 18 microM) of chlorhexidine, whereas only the 18 microM concentration reduced the membrane potential (delta psi). Chlorhexidine diacetate was a potent inhibitor of L-lactate and methane production from glucose fermentation by mixed ruminal microorganisms. However, because chlorhexidine also decreased acetate and propionate concentrations and increased ammonia concentrations in mixed-culture incubations, this antimicrobial compound may have limited application as a ruminant feed additive.
TI  - Bile-esculin test for presumptive identification of enterococci and streptococci: effects of bile concentration, inoculation technique, and incubation time.
AB  - The bile-esculin test is used to differentiate enterococci and group D streptococci from non-group D viridans group streptococci. The effects on test performance of the concentration of bile salts, inoculum, and duration of incubation were examined with 110 strains of enterococci, 30 strains of Streptococcus bovis, and 110 strains of non-group D viridans group streptococci. Optimal sensitivity (> 99%) and specificity (97%) of the bile-esculin test can be obtained with a bile concentration of 40%, a standardized inoculum of 10(6) CFU, and incubation for 24 h.
TI  - Inhibition effect of enterocin CCM 4231 in the rumen fluid environment.
AB  - Enterocin CCM 4231 is a bacteriocin with a broad antimicrobial spectrum produced  by the ruminal strain Enterococcus faecium CCM 4231. Its inhibitory effect towards enterococci, Ent. faecium EF 26/42, staphylococci, Streptococcus bovis AO 24/85 and Escherichia coli, as well as towards Listeria monocytogenes OHIO strain, in the rumen fluid environment was studied during culture at 37 and 30 degrees C for 24 h and 20 days. Enterocin CCM 4231 was added to the samples at a concentration of 3200 AU ml-1. The best inhibitory effect was noted against enterococci at both cultivation temperatures. A decrease in total cell count from 10(8) cfu ml-1/or 10(4) cfu ml-1 and from 10(5) cfu ml-1 to 10(1) cfu ml-1 was detected. Addition of enterocin to the rumen fluid also inhibited staphylococci (from 10(5) cfu ml-1 to 10(4) cfu ml-1 and/or 10(3) cfu ml-1). Gram-negative E. coli cells were inhibited at both cultivation temperatures (decrease from 10(6) cfu ml-1 to 10(1) cfu ml-1 at 37 degrees C, and from 10(7) cfu ml-1 to 10(5) cfu ml-1 at 30 degrees C). Enterococcus faecium EF 26/42 and Streptococcus bovis AO 24/85, the strains growing in the rumen fluid, were the most sensitive to the addition of enterocin during the first 24 h of fermentation (decrease from 10(10) cfu ml-1 and 10(8) cfu ml-1 to 10(6) cfu ml-1 and 10(4) cfu ml-1). An antilisterial effect of the bacteriocin was also confirmed. Further application of bacteriocin in ruminal ecology was indicated.
TI  - Lack of surface receptors not restriction-modification system determines F4 phage resistance in Streptococcus bovis II/1.
AB  - The resistance of Streptococcus bovis strain II/1, the producer of SbvI restriction endonuclease, to F4 phage infection was demonstrated by the double-agar-layer method. Despite the presence of restriction endonuclease SbvI which can cleave F4 phage DNA to numerous fragments in vitro, the evidence that adsorption inhibition is the most important defence mechanism in phage resistance of S. bovis II/1 strain was obtained by adhesion experiments in vivo. Electron microscopy of phage-host mixtures showed many phage particles on the bacterial surface of phage-sensitive S. bovis 47/3 control strain in comparison with no phage particles seen on S. bovis II/1 (phage-resistant) strain surface.
TI  - [Meningitis due to Streptococcus bovis in a healthy woman].
AB  
TI  - Relationship between intracellular phosphate, proton motive force, and rate of nongrowth energy dissipation (energy spilling) in Streptococcus bovis JB1.
AB  - When the rate of glucose addition to nongrowing Streptococcus bovis cell suspensions was increased, the fermentation was homolactic, fructose-1,6-diphosphate (FDP) increased, intracellular inorganic phosphate (P(i)) declined, and the energy-spilling rate increased. ATP and ADP were not significantly affected by glucose consumption rate, but the decrease in P(i) was sufficient to cause an increase in the free energy of ATP hydrolysis (delta G'p). The increase in delta G'p was correlated with an increase in proton motive force (delta p). S. bovis continuous cultures (dilution rate of 0.65 h-1) that were provided with ammonia as the sole nitrogen source also had high rates of lactate production and energy spilling. When Trypticase was added as a source of amino acids, lactate production decreased; a greater fraction of the glucose was converted to acetate, formate, and ethanol; and the energy-spilling rate decreased. Trypticase also caused a decrease in FDP, an increase in P(i), and a decrease in delta p. The change in delta p could be explained by P(i)-dependent changes in the delta G'p. When P(i) declined, delta G'p and delta p increased. The ratio of delta G'p to delta p (millivolt per millivolt) was always high (> 4) at low rates of energy spilling but declined when the energy-spilling rate increased. Based on these results, it appears that delta p and the energy-spilling rate are responsive to fluctuations in the intracellular P(i) concentration.
TI  - Streptococcus sanguis bacteremia and colorectal cancer.
AB  - Streptococcal bacteremia is an uncommon presentation for colorectal malignancy, yet most physicians are aware of the association between Streptococcus bovis infection and these malignancies. Many are unaware, however, that other streptococcal species are associated with colon and rectal cancers. In this case report and brief review, we highlight this association and discuss a case of Streptococcus sanguis bacteremia associated with an early invasive rectal cancer.
TI  - [Genotyping of isolates of bacteria and Candida].
AB  - Strain differentiation of Staphylococcus species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, and Candida species was performed by restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) of genomic DNA with HinfI or HaeIII followed by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis. REA of 19 methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates and 19 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolates revealed 8, and 14 patterns, respectively. Fifty-three isolates of S. epidermidis were divided into 39 groups on the basis of REA pattern. REA patterns obtained from different strains of the same species were more similar than those from different Staphylococcus species. A total of 67 patterns were noted among 215 S. pneumoniae isolates. There was some correlation between the REA patterns and serotypes. In addition, all 61 isolates showing the pattern 6 (serotype 19) were penicillin-resistant. Sixteen isolates of E. coli O157 and 18 isolates of E. coli O25 were analyzed by REA with HaeIII. Among 14 epidemiologically unrelated E. coli O157:H7 isolates, REA patterns were either identical or differed only by a few fragment bands. REA patterns of 7 isolates of heat stable enterotoxin producing E. coli O25 from an outbreak were identical. Eight distinct REA patterns were noted among 7 toxigenic C. difficile strains, and one to two strains were included in each group. Candida strains belonging to different six Candida species were analysed by REA. All C. albicans isolates (148 strains) showed one to four bright bands ranging from 4 to 8kb in size, and these strains were divided into 37 groups according to the REA patterns. Each Candida strain showed species-specific REA patterns. Twenty-one isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex were analyzed by PCR with primer complementary to the inverted repeat of IS6110(IS6110-PCR). The results of PCR of 19 M. tuberculosis isolates and 2 M. bovis BCG isolates revealed 15 patterns, and 1 pattern, respectively. Our results demonstrated that REA of genomic DNA with HinfI or HaeIII was a useful tool for strain differentiation. By comparing the species-specific REA patterns of reference strains, clinical isolates of Candida and Staphylococci could be identified to the species level if they could not be identified by routine biochemical methods. Because IS6110-PCR is simple and rapid to perform, it seems to be a good screening method to differentiate M. tuberculosis strains.
TI  - A review of bloat in feedlot cattle.
AB  - Improvements in feedlot management practices and the use of various feed additives have reduced, but not eliminated, the occurrence of bloat in feedlot cattle. Feedlot bloat reduces the profitability of production by compromising animal performance and more directly by causing fatalities. In feedlots, bloat is associated with the ingestion of large amounts of rapidly fermented cereal grain and destabilization of the microbial populations of the rumen. An abundance of rapidly fermented carbohydrate allows acid-tolerant bacteria (e.g., Streptococcus bovis and Lactobacillus spp.) to proliferate and produce excessive quantities of fermentation acids. As a result, ruminal pH becomes exceedingly low, and this impairs rumen motility. Further, the excessive production of mucopolysaccharide or "slime" increases the viscosity of ruminal fluid and stabilizes the foam implicated in frothy feedlot bloat. Although protocols have been developed to treat feedlot bloat, the most profitable approach is to use management strategies to reduce its likelihood. Amount of roughage, grain processing techniques, selection of cereal grain (e.g., corn, barley, and wheat), dietary adaptation periods, and various additives (e.g., ionophores) can influence the occurrence of bloat in feedlot cattle. Successful management of these factors depends on a thorough understanding of the behavioral, dietary, and microbial events that precipitate bloat in feedlot cattle.
TI  - Ruminal microbial and fermentative changes associated with experimentally induced subacute acidosis in steers.
AB  - We used six ruminally cannulated steers in a two-period crossover design to study ruminal fermentative and microbial changes associated with induced subacute acidosis. Steers were adapted to either an 80% alfalfa hay (hay-adapted)- or corn grain (grain-adapted)-based concentrate diet. After feed was withheld for 24 h, steers were overfed with an all-grain diet at 3.5 x NEm daily for 3 d. Ruminal contents and jugular blood samples were collected before withholding feed and at 0 and 12 h daily for 3 d during the overfeeding period. Ruminal samples were analyzed for pH, lactate, VFA concentrations, and counts of total anaerobic, amylolytic, lactic acid-producing and -fermenting bacteria, and ciliated protozoa. Blood samples were analyzed to assess acid-base status. Ruminal pH declined to a range of 5.5 to 5.0 with increased VFA concentrations, but normal lactate concentrations (<5 mM) were indicative of subacute acidosis. Total viable and amylolytic bacterial counts were higher (P < .05) in grain-adapted than hay-adapted steers. Anaerobic lactobacilli counts increased over time (P < .01) in both groups and were generally higher in grain-adapted than hay-adapted steers. Lactate-utilizing bacteria were initially greater in grain-adapted than hay-adapted steers and increased over time in both groups following grain challenge. Total ciliates were initially higher (P < .05) in grain-adapted than hay-adapted steers and decreased after 48 h in both groups. Blood acid-base changes were minimal. Bacterial changes associated with subacute acidosis resemble those reported during adaptation to grain feeding, and the decline in ciliated protozoa may be the only microbial indicator of a potentially acidotic condition in the rumen.
TI  - The ability of 2-deoxyglucose to promote the lysis of Streptococcus bovis JB1 via a mechanism involving cell wall stability.
AB  - The non-metabolizable glucose analog, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), decreased the growth rate and optical density of Streptococcus bovis JB1 20%, but it had an even greater effect on stationary phase cultures. Control cultures receiving only glucose (2 mg/ml) lysed very slowly (<5% decline in optical density in 48 h), but cultures that had been grown with glucose and 2-DG (2 mg/ml each) lysed much faster (>85% decline in optical density in 48 h). Cultures that were treated with inhibitors that decreased intracellular ATP (sodium fluoride, nigericin, and valinomycin or tetrachlorosalicylanilide) or membrane potential (sodium fluoride, nigericin, and valinomycin, tetrachlorosalicylanilide, or phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) did not promote lysis. 2-DG had its greatest effect when it was added at inoculation. If 2-DG was added at later times, less lysis was observed, and cells that were given 2-DG just prior to stationary phase were unaffected. Cells that were grown with glucose and 2-DG were more susceptible to cell wall-degrading enzymes (lysozyme and mutanolysin) than cells that had been grown only with glucose, but sublethal doses of penicillin during growth did not promote lysis after the cells had reached stationary phase. The idea that 2-DG might be affecting autolytic activity was supported by the observation that cultures washed and resuspended in fresh medium with or without 2-DG lysed at a slower rate than cultures that were not centrifuged or were resuspended in the culture supernatant.
TI  - Extracellular proteins and virulence in Streptococcus bovis isolates from pigeons.
AB  - The association between virulence and the occurrence of the extracellular proteins A, T1, T2 and T3 in the culture supernatant of pigeon Streptococcus bovis strains, was examined in experimental infection studies. Fourteen groups of 10-17 pigeons were inoculated intravenously with 1 x 10(9) CFU of S. bovis strains that belonged to the phenotypes A + T1, A - T1, A + T2, A - T2, A + T3 and A - T3, respectively. The overall postinoculation morbidity in the phenotype groups was 85%, 87%, 70%, 5%, 100% and 37%, respectively. These results indicate that strains producing A or T1 are of high virulence, those producing T3 only are of moderate virulence and those producing T2 are of low virulence. Virulence of S. bovis for pigeons was more clearly correlated with supernatant-phenotype than with serotype.
TI  - Identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  - We have used a PCR assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (sodA(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (S. acidominimus, S. agalactiae, S. alactolyticus, S. anginosus, S. bovis, S. constellatus, S. canis, S. cricetus, S. downei, S. dysgalactiae, S. equi subsp. equi, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, S. equinus, S. gordonii, S. iniae, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguis, S. pneumoniae, S. porcinus, S. pyogenes, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus, S. suis, S. thermophilus, and S. vestibularis). Phylogenetic analysis of these sodA(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16S rRNA sequences. We have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their sodA(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the sodA(int) fragments of the type species. We propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.
TI  - [Native valve infective endocarditis caused by Streptococcus bovis. Efficacy of short-term antibiotic therapy and usefulness of serial echocardiographic evaluation].
AB  - We report a case of infective endocarditis on native valve, due to Streptococcus  bovis, treated successfully with short time antibiotic therapy (10 days versus minimum suggested treatment of two weeks) by using penicillin G together with streptomycin (six days), followed, by treatment with imipenem (four days) because of allergic reactions. Diagnosis was simpler thanks to Durack's new criteria that include positive echocardiographic findings (valvular vegetations) within major clinical criteria for definite diagnosis of infective endocarditis, different from preceding Von Reyn's criteria which did not provide diagnostic weight for echocardiographic data. Serial echocardiograms have also been useful to evaluate the early response to the treatment and its persistent efficacy in the follow-up.

TI  - Clinical mastitis in dairy cattle in Ontario: frequency of occurrence and bacteriological isolates.
AB  - The objective of this study was to describe the frequency of occurrence of clinical mastitis in dairy herds in Ontario. The study group consisted of 65 dairy farms involved in a 2-year observational study, which included recording all clinical mastitis cases and milk sampling of quarters with clinical mastitis. Lactational incidence risks of 9.8% for abnormal milk only, 8.2% for abnormal milk with a hard or swollen udder, and 4.4% for abnormal milk plus systemic signs of illness related to mastitis were calculated for 2840 cows and heifers. Overall, 19.8% of cows experienced one or more cases of clinical mastitis during location. Teat injuries occurred in 2.1% of lactations. Standard bacteriology was performed on pretreatment milk samples from 834 cows with clinical mastitis. The bacteria isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (6.7%), Streptococcus agalactiae (0.7%), other Streptococcus spp. (14.1%), coliforms (17.2%), gram-positive bacilli (5.5%), Corynebacterium bovis (1.7%), and other Staphylococcus spp. (28.7%). There was no growth in 17.7% of samples, and 8.3% of samples were contaminated. Clinical mastitis is a common disease in dairy cows in Ontario; approximately 1 in 5 cow lactations have at lease one episode of clinical mastitis. There is, however, considerable variation in the incidence of clinical mastitis among farms. The majority of 1st cases of clinical mastitis occur early in lactation, and the risk of clinical mastitis increases with increasing parity. Environmental, contagious, and minor pathogens were all associated with cases of clinical mastitis.
TI  - Influence of parity and stage of lactation on the somatic cell count in bacteriologically negative dairy cows.
AB  - This study examines the influence of parity, stage of lactation, and single isolations (i.e., the isolation of a microorganism that could not be reisolated in the same quarter in the next sampling) of staphylococci other than Staphylococcus aureus (coagulase-negative staphylococci), Corynebacterium bovis, or esculin-positive cocci other than Streptococcus uberis (referred to as esculin-positive cocci throughout) on the monthly log(e)-transformed somatic cell count (SCC) for 180 first, second, and third parity cows that were observed over a whole lactation. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to analyze the data. No significant effect was found for the infection variable. However, the results indicated that even single isolations of coagulase-negative staphylocci, C. bovis, or esculin-positive cocci resulted in a numerical or statistically significant increase in SCC. Least squares mean SCC (log(e)-transformed) for bacterio-logically negative cows and cows with single isolations of coagulase-negative staphylococci, C. bovis, or esculin-positive cocci were 3.90, 3.97, 4.08, and 4.17, respectively. Significant effects of parity, stage of lactation, and the interaction of parity and stage of lactation could not be found when only bacteriologically negative cows were considered. Least squares mean SCC for first, second, and third parity cows were 3.80, 3.93, and 3.97, respectively. However, the effects of parity, stage of lactation, and the interaction of parity and stage of lactation were significant when all 180 cows were included. Therefore, these effects must be due to factors that were present in the infected groups.
TI  - Purification, characterization, and nucleotide sequence of an intracellular maltotriose-producing alpha-amylase from Streptococcus bovis 148.
AB  - An intracellular alpha-amylase from Streptococcus bovis 148 was purified and characterized. The enzyme was induced by maltose and soluble starch and produced about 80% maltotriose from soluble starch. Maltopentaose was hydrolyzed to maltotriose and maltose and maltohexaose was hydrolyzed mainly to maltotriose by the enzyme. Maltotetraose, maltotriose, and maltose were not hydrolyzed. This intracellular enzyme was considered to be a maltotriose-producing enzyme. The enzymatic characteristics and hydrolysis product from soluble starch were different from those of the extracellular raw-starch-hydrolyzing alpha-amylase of strain 148. The deduced amino acid sequence of the intracellular alpha-amylase was similar to the sequences of the mature forms of extracellular liquefying alpha-amylases from Bacillus strains, although the intracellular alpha-amylase did not contain a signal peptide. No homology between the intracellular and extracellular alpha-amylases of S. bovis 148 was observed.
TI  - Application of the extracellular alpha-amylase gene from Streptococcus bovis 148  to construction of a secretion vector for yogurt starter strains.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus ATCC 19258, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus T-11, and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis IL1403 were transformed with the alpha-amylase gene (amyA) from Streptococcus bovis 148 by using a wide host-range vector, and all the transformants secreted the alpha-amylase successfully. Since the promoter and the secretion signal of the amyA gene were functional in these strains, we constructed a secretion vector using the expression elements of amyA. Trials to secrete foreign enzymes in yogurt starter strains were performed using this novel secretion vector.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis infection of the central nervous system: report of two cases  and review.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis is an uncommon cause of meningitis and subdural empyema. We report one case each of meningitis and subdural empyema in which S. bovis biotype II was isolated from both the spinal fluid and blood. In one case, the organisms were seen on a gram-stained preparation of cerebrospinal fluid. The first patient presented with gastrointestinal symptoms of unknown etiology, was immunosuppressed, and recovered. The second patient presented with syncope, developed a subdural empyema, and died; at autopsy, a colonic adenoma was found. A review of the English-language literature revealed only 14 previously reported cases of meningitis due to S. bovis and no cases of subdural empyema due to S. bovis. These cases indicate the importance of complete laboratory identification of specific organisms and confirm the need for a thorough neurological examination and search for underlying gastrointestinal disease in cases of S. bovis infection.
TI  - Use of the Malthus conductance growth analyser to determine numbers of thermophilic streptococci on stainless steel.
AB  - The use of the Malthus conductance growth analyser for the detection of Streptococcus bovis attached to stainless steel surface was evaluated. A comparison between the results from acridine orange epifluorescence direct counts, swab recovery viable count and conductance estimates of attached cell concentrations, based on calibrations for planktonic cells, showed that the conductance results were up to 2 log10 greater than the epifluorescence results and the swab counts. The growth rates of planktonic and attached cells were similar over 16 h using the Malthus technique. This suggests that the Malthus technique detects more attached cells of Strep. bovis than epifluorescence microscopy or swab recovery.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the secY gene homolog from Mycobacterium bovis BCG.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of a 1,513 bp fragment of Mycobacterium bovis BCG containing the secY gene homolog and partial adk gene that encodes an adenylate kinase has been determined. The secY gene of BCG has an open reading frame of 441 amino acids with homology to the SecY protein family. Comparative analyses of the deduced amino acid sequence of additional partial ORF revealed strong similarity to the known adenylate kinases.
TI  - Isolation and overexpression of a gene encoding an extracellular beta-(1,3-1,4)-glucanase from Streptococcus bovis JB1.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis JB1 was found to produce a 25-kDa extracellular enzyme active against beta-(1,3-1,4)-glucans. A gene was isolated encoding a specific beta-(1,3-1,4)-glucanase that corresponds to this size and belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 16. A 4- to 10-fold increase in supernatant beta-glucanase activity was obtained when the cloned beta-glucanase gene was reintroduced into S. bovis JB1 by use of constructs based on the plasmid vector pTRW10 or pIL253. The beta-(1,3-1,4)-glucanase gene was also expressed upon introduction of the pTRW10 construct pTRWL1R into Lactococcus lactis IL2661 and Enterococcus faecalis JH2-SS, although extracellular activity was 8- to 50-fold lower than that in S. bovis JB1. The beta-(1,3-1,4)-glucanase purified from the culture supernatant of S. bovis JB1 carrying pTRWL1R showed a K(m) of 2.8 mg per ml and a Vmax of 338 mumol of glucose equivalents per min per mg of protein with barley beta-glucan as the substrate. The S. bovis beta-(1,3-1,4)-glucanase may contribute to the ability of this bacterium to utilize starch by degrading structural polysaccharides present in endosperm cell walls.
TI  - Coronary embolism complicating aortic valve endocarditis: treatment with placement of an intracoronary stent.
AB  - A 37-year-old man, who had received 3 weeks of antimicrobial therapy for aortic value endocarditis, presented with an acute anteroseptal wall myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography demonstrated occlusion of the mid left anterior descending artery, thought to have been caused by embolization of a sterile vegetation. Following failure of balloon dilation to achieve vessel patency, this was achieved by placement of an intracoronary stent.
TI  - Perforated cecal adenocarcinoma presenting as a thigh abscess.
AB  - Complicated colorectal carcinoma has several symptoms, the most common being bleeding and obstruction. Occasionally it will cause perforation, which carries a worse prognosis. We report a case of perforated adenocarcinoma of the cecum that presented as an abscess of the thigh. We also present a review of the literature on this subject.
TI  - Isolated tricuspid valve endocarditis in nonaddicted patients: a diagnostic challenge.
AB  - Isolated native nonrheumatic tricuspid valve endocarditis rarely is described in  the absence of intravenous drug use, intracardiac catheters, or cardiac anomalies. We diagnosed tricuspid valve endocarditis in two elderly nonaddicted patients with recurrent pulmonary infiltrates, anemia, and microscopic hematuria that occurred during several months and was caused by Gemella morbillorum and Candida glabrata, respectively. We have reviewed 27 other cases of nonaddicted patients with tricuspid valve endocarditis from the literature and discussed etiology, clinical characteristics, and outcome. Mean age was 53.5 years (range, 22 to 74 years old), and 72% had underlying medical conditions. Staphylococcus oureus, Streptococcus bovis, and candida species were the causative organisms in 70% of the cases. Average duration of infection before diagnosis was 9.3 months. We conclude that isolated tricuspid valve endocarditis in nonaddicted patients occurs mainly in the middle-aged and older persons, mimicking chronic illness and community-acquired pneumonia. In the absence of a history of intravenous drug use, diagnostic delays are common. We suggest that right-sided endocarditis must be considered in any patient with the "Tricuspid Syndrome," consisting of recurrent pulmonary events, anemia, and microscopic hematuria. Careful evaluation of prior medical records and clinical course can be very helpful. Echocardiography and serial blood cultures provide the key to diagnosis.
TI  - Gene knockout of the intracellular amylase gene by homologous recombination in Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis expresses two different amylases, one intracellular and the other secreted. A suicide vector containing part of the intracellular alpha-amylase gene from Streptococcus bovis WI-1 was recombined into the S. bovis WI-1 chromosome to disrupt the endogenous gene. Recombination was demonstrated by Southern blot, and zymogram analysis confirmed the loss of the intracellular amylase. Amylase activity in cell-free extracts of the recombinant grown in the presence of 1% starch was only 7% of wild type. The rate of logarithmic growth of the recombinant was 15-20% of the wild type in medium containing either 1% glucose, starch, or cellobiose. Revertants and non-amylase control recombinants had logarithmic growth rates that were the same as wild type. Plasmid transformants containing multiple copies of the cloned gene expressed up to threefold higher levels of intracellular amylase activity than wild type but did not demonstrate elevated growth rates. These results suggest that a critical level of expression of the intracellular amylase gene may be important for rapid growth of the bacterium.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of vancomycin constant-rate infusion in the treatment of chronic Gram-positive bone and joint infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of vancomycin constant-rate infusion over 24 h in the treatment of Gram-positive bone infections, METHODS: Vancomycin (40 mg/kg/day) was administered without a loading dose to 15 patients (12 male, three female) aged 23--90 years, weighing 46--85 kg, with postoperative chronic bone and joint infections. The 24-h dose was adjusted to maintain plasma levels between 25 and 35 mg/L. Mean duration of therapy was 6.2 months (4--8.5) via a portable infusion pump. Sites of infection included hip and femur (10), tibia (three), patella (one) and vertebrae (one). Sequestrectomy (two), removal of material (7/8 prosthetic hips, 1/5 metal implants) and debridement (two) were performed at the beginning of the treatment. Involved bacteria included Staphylococcus aureus (eight, six methicillin resistant), S. epidermidis (four methicillin-resistant), Enterococcus faecalis (one), Enterococcus avium (one) and Streptococcus bovis (one). RESULTS: MIC of vancomycin ranged from 1 to 4 mg/L. The mean vancomycin bone concentration when available was 67.7plus minus38.9 microg/L. Based on a mean post-treatment follow-up of 14plus minus4 months (6--20.6), cure was achieved in 10 patients (66.6%). Failures were related to the inability to remove the infected prosthesis (one) or implants (three) and to the persistence of a deep wound abcess (one). Adverse events included pruritus (four cases), tinnitus (two), mild transient elevation of creatinine level (three) and transient neutropenia (two). Vancomycin was maintained in all the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged treatment with vancomycin constant-rate infusion is effective and safe for treatment of Gram-positive chronic bone and joint infections, providing that complete surgical debridement and prosthetic material removal are performed.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin against Gram-positive bloodstream isolates.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, rifampicin, imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 414 bloodstream isolates of Gram-positive cocci. Quinupristin-dalfopristin inhibited strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae at 0.12 mg/L, methicillin- and/or erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at 0.5 mg/L, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus anginosus at 1 mg/L and Enterococcus faecalis at 8 mg/L.
TI  - Estimation of interdependence among quarters of the bovine udder with subclinical mastitis and implications for analysis.
AB  - Interdependency among udder quarters with subclinical mastitis was evaluated on 150 farms using a total of 35,828 udder quarters. The occurrence of high somatic cell count (SCC) (> 250,000 cells/ml) in 0, 3, and 4 quarters occurred at a higher rate than would be expected based on independence of the quarters. For all bacterial species, intramammary infection in 0, 2, 3, or 4 quarters of the same cow occurred at a higher rate than would be expected based on independence of the quarters. Intramammary infection and high SCC were found less often in front quarters than in rear quarters. High SCC and intramammary infection occurred more often in right front quarters than in left front quarters. High SCC in diagonal quarters occurred at a lower rate than expected. Corynebacterium bovis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Staphylococcus aureus had the highest intraclass correlation within herd. Streptococcus uberis had a very low intraclass correlation within herd. The intraclass correlation within cow for the natural logarithm of SCC was 0.47. Corynebacterium bovis and Strep. agalactiae had the highest intraclass correlation within cow, and Streptococcus dysgalactiae had the lowest. Analytical methods were proposed to manage the problem of interdependence and its effect on the design or evaluation of field studies on subclinical mastitis.
TI  - [Infection by Strongyloides stercoralis in the county of Safor, Spain].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Strongyloides stercoralis is an endemic nematode in tropical and subtropical regions, but almost unknown in Spain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In order to know some epidemiological, clinical and analytic features of this infection in our area (La Safor, Valencia), we performed a prospective study for 19 months. Through the search for the parasite in feces of patients with eosinophilia, we identified 37 subjects who were studied at diagnosis and 4 months later. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients (89%) were currently, or had been agricultural workers, and thirty had worked barefooted and/or had drunk contaminated irrigation water. Twenty-three patients (62%) had a chronic or immunosuppressive diseases, and two of them on steroid treatment, developed a disseminated strongyloidiasis. Thirteen patients (35%) were asymptomatic; the rest had clinical manifestations attributed S. stercoralis, mainly digestive. Two of the patients with disseminated strongyloidiasis also had concomitant bacterial infections by Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus faecalis and Enterobacter sp. At diagnosis, besides eosinophilia, 86.5% had raised levels of IgE. Four months later treatment, the number of eosinophils was normal and IgE levels significantly decreased. The diagnostic yield of parasitic study of feces was increased with the number of samples examined. Thiabendazole achieved erradication of the parasite in 35 patients, and the other two died because of disseminated strongyloidiasis. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of eosinophilia in patients from rural areas with subtropical climate should raise suspicion about infection by S. stercoralis, which, although sometimes is asymptomatic, may cause systemic bacterial infections in cases of hyperinfestation, specially when glucocorticoid treatment is given.
TI  - [Combination of colorectal tumor and Streptococcus bovis endocarditis. Apropos of 3 cases].

TI  - Lateral neck abscess caused by Streptococcus bovis in a patient with undiagnosed  colon cancer.
AB  - Bacteraemia or endocarditis caused by Streptococcus bovis, a non-enterococcal group D streptococcus, is a very common finding in patients suffering from intestinal tumours or other colon diseases. A case of a patient with a laternal neck abscess caused by S. bovis is reported. During the treatment the patient was found to have colonic malignant lesions. The problems in the appropriate diagnosis and the possible correlation between these two clinical entities are presented and discussed.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis infection in turkey poults.
AB  - Increased mortality associated with Streptococcus bovis infection occurred on three independent turkey facilities in California. The age of the flocks during these outbreaks ranged from 1 to 3 weeks of age. Gross lesions included extensive pale foci in the pectoral muscles, markedly enlarged, dark and friable or mottled spleens, and swollen livers. Histopathology revealed multifocal necrosis in the spleen and Kupffer cell hypertrophy with necrosis of macrophages. Electron microscopy of liver showed replicating coccoid bacteria within the phagosomes of macrophages. 5. bovis was consistently isolated from bone marrow, liver and spleen.

AB  - A gene which was shown to be cotranscribed with the NAD+-dependent malic enzyme gene (maeE) of Streptococcus bovis ATCC 15352 was revealed to encode L-malate-specific permease (MaeP), which showed high activity at low pHs (pH 5.1 to 5.9). MaeP was strongly inhibited by the ionophores nigericin and valinomycin.
TI  - Activity of H(+)-ATPase in ruminal bacteria with special reference to acid tolerance.
AB  - Batch culture experiments showed that permeabilized cells and membranes of Ruminococcus albus and Fibrobacter succinogenes, acid-intolerant celluloytic bacteria, have only one-fourth to one-fifth as much H(+)-ATPase as Megasphaera elsdenii and Streptococcus bovis, which are relatively acid tolerant. Even in the cells grown in continuous culture at pH 7.0, the acid-intolerant bacteria contained less than half as much H(+)-ATPase as the acid-tolerant bacteria. The amounts of H(+)-ATPase in the acid-tolerant bacteria were increased by more than twofold when the cells were grown at the lowest pH permitting growth, whereas little increase was observed in the case of the acid-intolerant bacteria. These results indicate that the acid-intolerant bacteria not only contain smaller amounts of H(+)-ATPase at neutral pH but also have a lower capacity to enhance the level of H(+)-ATPase in response to low pH than the acid-tolerant bacteria. In addition, the H(+)-ATPases of the acid-intolerant bacteria were more sensitive to low pH than those of the acid-tolerant bacteria, although the optimal pHs were similar.
TI  - Cloning, sequence, and expression of the L-(+) lactate dehydrogenase of Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - The ldh gene encoding the fructose-1,6-diphosphate-dependent L-(+) lactate dehydrogenase from the ruminal bacterium Streptococcus bovis was cloned and sequenced. A genomic library of S. bovis JB1 DNA was constructed in lambda ZAP II and screened by use of a heterologous probe derived from the cloned Streptococcus mutans ldh gene. Several clones were isolated that contained a common 2.9-kb fragment as determined by restriction analysis. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a 987-bp open reading frame with extensive homology to Streptococcus thermophilus and S. mutans ldh nucleic acid and amino acid sequences. Expression of the cloned S. bovis ldh gene in Escherichia coli was confirmed by the ability to complement the ldh mutation of E. coli FMJ39, by using an in-gel activity screen and by enzymatic assay. Increased LDH activity was observed in S. bovis JB1 containing the cloned ldh genes on a multicopy plasmid.
TI  - Association between management practices, dairy herd characteristics, and somatic cell count of bulk tank milk.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether particular dairy management practices and herd characteristics were associated with somatic cell count (SCC) of bulk tank milk. DESIGN: Analysis of records. SAMPLE POPULATION: Milk samples collected from 59,435 cows housed in 843 dairy herds between March 1992 and June 1994. PROCEDURE: Results of bacterial culture of milk samples and data on farm housing, sanitation, milking system, and management were collected. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine sources of variation in bulk tank milk SCC among herds. RESULTS: Prevalence of Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus mastitis was associated with bulk tank milk SCC. In herds free of S agalactiae mastitis, prevalence of S aureus and Corynebacterium bovis mastitis were important. For herds without S agalactiae mastitis, use of sawdust bedding was associated with a decrease in SCC and a dirty loose housing area was associated with an increase. Increased milk production, repeated mastitis control visits, and use of particular predip compounds were significantly associated with reduced SCC in all herds, regardless of whether any cows in the herd had S agalactiae mastitis. In herds with S agalactiae mastitis, use of iodine (certain concentrations), chlorhexidine, peroxide, or sodium chlorite-lactic acid as a predip was associated with a decrease in SCC. Only use of sodium chlorite-lactic acid predip was significantly associated with a decrease in SCC in herds without S agalactiae mastitis. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Important factors associated with bulk tank milk SCC were prevalence of S agalactiae and S aureus mastitis, careful application of particular predip compounds, avoiding a dirty loose housing area, and use of a service to regularly monitor prevalence of mastitis in the herd.
TI  - In-vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin compared with other widely used antibiotics against strains isolated from patients with endocarditis.
AB  - The activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin was compared with that of other widely  used antibiotics against 355 strains isolated from patients with endocarditis. MICs were determined by a standard agar dilution method. Quinupristin/dalfopristin was inhibitory at 1 mg/L for all coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 36) and for the majority of Staphylococcus aureus strains (n = 87). The activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against 186 viridans streptococci was somewhat dependent on the species, with MIC50s ranging from 0.5 to 2 mg/L, being least active against Streptococcus bovis and most active against Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus mitis. For the staphylococci, quinupristin/dalfopristin was as active against erythromycin-susceptible as erythromycin-resistant strains. Viridans streptococci showed a slight but significant correlation between sensitivity to erythromycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin. It is concluded that quinupristin/dalfopristin has the potential to treat serious infections such as endocarditis caused by Gram-positive cocci.

TI  - Peptidases of the rumen bacterium, Prevotella ruminicola.
AB  - Prevotella (formerly Bacteroides) ruminicola is a numerous rumen bacterium which  plays a significant role in the metabolism of proteins and peptides in the rumen. Measurement of the hydrolysis of synthetic aminopeptidase substrates by sonicated extracts and whole cells of different species of rumen bacteria indicated that P. ruminicola had the greatest range and specific activity of dipeptidyl peptidases among the species tested. Streptococcus bovis hydrolysed some dipeptidyl peptidase substrates to a lesser extent, and several species broke down Ala2-p-nitroanilide, including Ruminobacter amylophilus, Ruminococcus spp. and Veillonella parvula. Dipeptidyl peptidases, which cleave dipeptides from the amino-terminus of longer peptides, were much more active than aminopeptidases removing single amino acids in P. ruminicola. Ion-exchange chromatography of sonicated extracts of P. ruminicola M384 revealed at least four distinct activities: one hydrolysed Ala2-p-nitroanilide, ValAla-p-nitroanilide, Ala4and Ala5; another was an O2-sensitive activity hydrolysing GlyArg-4-methoxynapthylamide, ArgArg-4-methoxynaphthylamide, Gly5 and ValGlySerGlu, similar to dipeptidyl peptidase type I DPP-1); a third hydrolysed GlyPro-p-nitroanilide and GlyPro-4-methoxynapthylamide and was similar to dipeptidyl peptidase type IV XDPP-4); a fourth broke down LysAla-4-methoxynaphthylamide. All of the enzymes, and particularly those active against Ala2-p-nitroanilide and GlyPro-p-nitroanilide, were inhibited by serine protease inhibitors, and all except DPP-4 were inhibited by EDTA. Both DPP-1 and the enzyme hydrolysing LysAla-4-methoxynaphthylamide were inhibited strongly by iodoacetate. DPP-4 was inhibited completely by diprotin A. Competitive inhibition experiments suggested that DPP-1 was less important than the other enzymes in the breakdown of peptide mixtures.
TI  - [Evaluation of a rapid method for the identification of the Enterococcus genus].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The evaluation of the reliability of a group of three tests: pyrrolidonil-arilamidase, rapid test in NaCl esculin broth and group D antistreptococci agglutination for the rapid identification of the Enterococcus genus were performed. METHODS: One hundred fifty-eight strains of streptococci: 110 strains of Enterococcus faecalis, 8 E. faecium, 3 E. avium, 16 Streptococcus intermedius, 7 S. salivarius, 4 S. bovis, 4 S. constellatus, 2 S. sanguis and 1 strain of S. equinus, S. mitis, S. uberis and S. mutans were studied. The tests used were: rapid test in NaCl- esculin broth, pyrrolidonyl-arilamidase and antigroup D streptococcus agglutination (Patho Dx Strep D/PYR; Diagnostic Product Corporation). All catalase-negative gram-positive cocci or coccibacilli which were positive in the three tests were considered to belong to the Enterococcus genus. The usefulness of Gram staining in culture in thioglycolate broth was also studied comparing it with the results obtained with solid medium. RESULTS: The results of the proposed identification scheme were evaluated calculating different parameters: sensitivity 98%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value, 100%, and negative predictive value 94%. No significant differences were observed between the results obtained with Gram staining with thioglycolate broth and those obtained with solid medium except in the case of the Streptococcus mutans strain. CONCLUSIONS: The application of a combination of tests: pyrroidonyl-arilamidase, antistreptococci group D agglutination and rapid test in NaCl-esculin broth to catalase-negative gram-positive cocci and coccobacilli allows reliable identification in a maximum of three hours of strains belonging to the Enterococcus genus.
TI  - An effective method of RNA extraction from bacteria refractory to disruption, including mycobacteria.
AB  - A high yield, rapid and simple procedure is described for extracting RNA from mycobacteria and other micro-organisms refractory to disruption. The method yielded 20 microg RNA/109 Mycobacterium bovis BCG, more than 10 times greater than our previous method. Intact full length hsp 70 (dnaK) mRNA was detected by northern blotting and quantitated after heat shock by slot blot hybridisation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of natural udder infection with minor pathogens on subsequent natural infection with major pathogens. SAMPLE POPULATION: 7 dairy herds with low bulk milk somatic cell count. PROCEDURE: During a 20-month prospective study, milk samples were collected from diary cows at regular intervals and from quarters with clinical signs of mastitis. Incidence of intramammary infection was calculated in uninfected quarters and in quarters infected with minor pathogens. A within-cow, matched case-control analysis was used to evaluate the effect of minor pathogens on subsequent infection with major pathogens. RESULTS: Quarters infected with minor pathogens had higher somatic cell count than did uninfected quarters. In quarters infected with Corynebacterium bovis, the rate of infection with major pathogens was lower, whereas in quarters infected with coagulase-negative Micrococcaceae, the rate of infection with major pathogens was higher than that in uninfected quarters. From the within-cow comparison, it appeared that, in quarters infected with minor pathogens, infection with major pathogens was significantly lower than that in comparable control quarters not infected with minor pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Minor pathogens have a protective effect against infection with major pathogens. The protective effect of C bovis against subsequent infection with major pathogens appears to be greater than the effect of coagulase-negative Micrococcaceae.
TI  - Emergence of vancomycin resistance in the genus Streptococcus: characterization of a vanB transferable determinant in Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis NEM760 was isolated from a stool swab collected on admission  from a patient as surveillance for vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Strain NEM760 was identified as S. bovis by conventional biochemical methods and partial sequence analysis of its 16S rRNA. This strain was resistant to a low level of vancomycin (MIC, 64 micrograms/ml) but was susceptible to teicoplanin (MIC, 1 micrograms/ml), and vancomycin induced resistance to both glycopeptides. The presence of a vanB-related gene in NEM760 was demonstrated in a PCR assay which enabled specific amplification of a 635-hp internal segment of vanB. Sequence analysis of the corresponding PCR product revealed that it was highly homologous (96% identity) to the prototype vanB sequence of Enterococcus faecalis V583. The VanB resistance of determinant of S. bovis NEM760 was transferred by conjugation to E. faecalis and Enterococcus faecium at a similar frequency of 2 x 10(-5) per donor. SmaI-digested genomic DNAs of independently obtained transconjugants of E. faecalis and E. faecium were analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and Southern hybridization with a vanB DNA probe. The electrophoretic and hybridization patterns obtained with all transconjugants of the same species were indistinguishable and revealed vanB-containing chromosomal insertions of approximately 100 kb. These results suggest that the genes mediating VanB-type resistance in S. bovis NEM760 are part of large transferable genetic elements. The results presented in the report demonstrate for the first time the role of streptococci in the dissemination of vancomycin resistance among gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Secreted antigens as virulence associated markers in Streptococcus bovis strains  from pigeons.
AB  - SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis were performed on the culture supernatant of 7 pigeon S. bovis reference strains belonging to the serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 5. The culture supernatant of highly virulent serotype 1, 2 and 5 strains contained four antigens that were absent in low virulent serotype 3 strains, notably a 185 kDa minor protein band (A) and a triplet (T1) of 70 kDa. The less virulent serotype 3 strains on the other hand contained protein triplets, that had a molecular mass of either 68 kDa (T2) or 74 kDa (T3). The prevalence of A, T1, T2 and T3 was examined in 68 S. bovis strains isolated from healthy pigeons and in 68 S. bovis strains isolated from pigeons that died of S. bovis septicaemia. Six supernatant phenotypes were identified: A-T1 (32 strains), A- T2 (10 strains), A- T3 (7 strains), A+ T1 (84 strains), A+ T2 (1 strain) and A+ T3 (2 strains). Ninety-four percent of the strains lacking the A and T1 proteins were isolated from healthy pigeons, and only 6% were isolated from septicaemia. Strains expressing A and/or T1, however, were isolated form septicaemia in 57% of the cases. These observations may indicate that the A and/or T1 proteins are associated with virulence.
TI  - [Serologic study in patients with streptococcal infective endocarditis].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infective endocarditis is a systemic disease in which there are a continuously antigenic stimulation of immunologic system. Streptococcus is still the most frequent cause of infective endocarditis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated the presence of antibody (AB), total and IgM by indirect immune fluorescence technique, in four groups of population: streptococcal infective endocarditis (SIE), streptococcal bacteraemia (SB), Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis, and healthy people. Antigens used were: 1) their own strain isolated from the blood of patients with SIE and SB inverted question markhomologous AB inverted question mark, and; 2) seven species of Streptococcus: Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus sanguis I, Streptococcus sanguis II, nutritional dependent streptococci and Enterococcus faecalis (heterologous AB). RESULTS: Homologous antibodies: titers > or = 1/512 were found in all patients with SIE and only in 2 with SB (sensitivity 100% and specificity 93%). IgM titer (threshold 1/32) was positive only in patients with SIE (sensitivity 75,5% and specificity 100%). The fall of the AB titer was continuous and slow, despite the good clinical evolution of patients. (AB titers were > or = 1/512 and IgM > or = 1/64 in 30% of patients 1 year later). Heterologous AB: in spite of statistically significant difference found in SIE versus the other groups, sensitivity of this test (threshold 1/256) is low, confidence interval include expected random value (50%), specificity is 88%. CONCLUSIONS: The utility of homologous AB for diagnosing infective endocarditis is demonstrated. On the contrary for heterologous AB, antigenic common fractions must be found in the different species.
TI  - Characterization of proteolytic activities of rumen bacterial isolates from forage-fed cattle.
AB  - The proteolytic activities of eight strains of ruminal bacteria isolated from New Zealand cattle were characterized with respect to their cellular location, response to proteinase inhibitors and hydrolysis of artificial proteinase substrates. The Streptococcus bovis strains had predominantly cell-bound activity, which included a mixture of serine and cysteine-type proteinases which had high activity against leucine p-nitroanilide (LPNA). The Eubacterium strains had a mainly cell-associated activity with serine and metallo-type proteinases which showed high activity against the chymotrypsin substrate, N-succinyl alanine alanine phenylalanine proline p-nitroanilide (NSAAPPPNA) and some LPNA activity. A Butyrivibrio strain, C211, had a cell-bound mixture of cysteine and metallo-proteinase activities and strongly hydrolysed NSAAPPPNA and LPNA while the high activity Butyrivibrio-like strain, B316, had a cell-bound, mainly serine proteinase activity which strongly hydrolysed NSAAPPPNA. A Prevotella-like strain, C21a, had a mixture of cysteine, serine and metallo-proteinase activities which were cell-bound and hydrolysed LPNA. The activities of these strains did not match those of the bacterial fraction of rumen fluid, which contained activities mainly of the cysteine type with specificity towards the substrate N-succinyl phenylalanine p-nitroanilide. The contribution of these strains to proteolysis in the rumen is discussed.
TI  - Catabolite regulation in a diauxic strain and a nondiauxic strain of Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis JB1 utilized glucose preferentially to lactose and grew diauxically, but S. bovis 581AXY2 grew nondiauxically and used glucose preferentially only when the glucose concentration was very high (greater than 5 mM). As little as 0.1 mM glucose completely inhibited the lactose transport of JB1. The lactose transport system of 581AXY2 was at least tenfold less sensitive to glucose, and 1 mM glucose caused only a 50% inhibition of lactose transport. Both strains had phosphotransferase systems (PTSs) for glucose and lactose. The glucose PTSs were constitutive, but little lactose PTS activity was detected unless lactose was the energy source for growth. JB1 had approximately threefold more glucose PTS activity than 581AXY2 (1600 versus 600 nmol glucose (mg protein)-1(min)-1. The glucose PTS of JB1 showed normal Michaelis Menten kinetics, and the affinity constant (Ks) was 0.12 mM. The glucose PTS of 581AXY2 was atypical, and the plot of velocity versus velocity/substrate was biphasic. The low capacity system had a Ks of 0.20 mM, but the Ks of the high capacity system was greater than 6 mM. On the basis of these results, diauxic growth is dependent on the affinity of glucose enzyme II and the velocity of glucose transport.
TI  - [Biology of lysogenic strains of Streptococcus bovis and virulent mutants of their temperate phages].
AB  - Three lysogenic streptococcal strains and four virulent mutants of temperate phages were studied. The bacterial strains proved to be close to the type strain of Streptococcus bovis in their morphological, cultural, physiological, and biochemical properties. Investigation into the interaction of the lysogenic cultures with virulent mutants of temperate phages showed that the culture age optimal for infecting was 3-5 h; intense lysis began in the second hour after infection and was virtually completed by the end of the third hour, i.e., the procedure of obtaining phages in HMT medium took 7-8 h. Phage titers in phage lysates varied from 3.93 x 10(10) to 11.25 x 10(10) active phage particles per ml; residual amounts of viable bacteria varied from 0.7 x 10(6) to 34.0 x 10(6) cells per ml. In liquid HMT medium, phage production by lysogenic cultures was not limited by 0.3% glucose or maltose, 0.5% peptone, or casein hydrolysate. Descriptions of virulent mutants VM 6/6, VM 32/6, VM 28/28, and VM 54/54 of temperate phages of Str. bovis are presented.
TI  - [Bacteremia and endocarditis caused by Streptococcus bovis in patients with alcoholic hepatopathy without evidence of colonic pathology].
AB  - The association of Streptococcus bovis bacteremia and endocarditis with colonic pathology, mainly neoplastic, is well known. Its relationship with liver disease without evidence of gastrointestinal disease has been rarely described. To analyze the association between S. bovis infection and liver disease, positive blood cultures for this microorganism in hospitalized patients in the Internal Medicine and Gastroenterology Departments from December 1993 until October 1995, have been reviewed. Three cases of S. bovis infection (one bacteremia, two endocarditis) were found. Alcoholic liver disease was diagnosed in all three patients, with associated hepatitis C virus in one of them. Colonic pathology was excluded by colonoscopy and/or barium enema. Other gastrointestinal disorders were excluded by means of gastroscopy, barium gastrointestinal study and abdominal ultrasonography. Antibiotic therapy was based in betalactamics, with associated aminoglycoside in two cases. One patient needed aortic and mitral valve replacement and another one needed orthotopic liver transplantation. No new gastrointestinal pathology emerged in the follow-up (5-23 months). Cases of S. bovis bacteremia and endocarditis should be screened not also for colonic pathology, but also for liver disease, particularly in alcoholics.

TI  - Effects of a strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Levucell SC1), a microbial additive for ruminants, on lactate metabolism in vitro.
AB  - The effect of Levucell SC, a strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae marked as a feed  additive for ruminants, was investigated in vitro on lactate metabolism by the ruminal bacteria Streptococcus bovis and Megasphaera elsdenii. The coculture between 10(7) live cells x mL(-1) of SC and a Streptococcus bovis strain in the presence of glucose reduced lactate production by the bacterial strain. Live yeast cells were able to compete with Streptococcus bovis for glucose utilization in strictly anaerobic conditions, so less glucose was available for the bacterium. SC also stimulated L-lactate utilization by a strain of M. elsdenii. The effect depended on the concentration of yeast cells added. Bacterial growth and fermentation end-product concentrations were also increased in the presence of SC. Some amino acids and vitamins, but not dicarboxylic acids, stimulated the bacterial specific activity of L-lactate uptake. SC was able to provide amino acids to M. elsdenii. In a coculture of Streptococcus bovis and M. elsdenii on glucose, the reduction of lactate concentration was improved by SC, the same trend being observed when maltose or soluble starch were used as carbon and energy source. These results indicate that SC can be a very useful tool to reduce lactate accumulation in vitro during fermentation of soluble sugars.
TI  - Purification and partial characterization of a novel antibacterial agent (Bac1829) Produced by Staphylococcus aureus KSI1829.
AB  - A novel antimicrobial agent from Staphylococcus aureus KSI1829, designated Bac1829, was purified by sequential steps of ammonium sulfate precipitation, Sephadex G-50 gel filtration chromatography, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Purified Bac1829 has a molecular mass of 6,418 +/- 2 Da. The peptide in heat stable, since full biological activity is retained after heating at 95 degrees C for 15 min, and it is destroyed by digestion with proteases. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed a high concentration of Ala and Gly residues, which respectively comprised 24 and 19% of the total amino acid content. Additionally, high levels of hydrophobic amino acids were present, accounting for the hydrophobic nature of Bac1829. Purified Bac1829 killed exponentially growing Corynebacterium renale in a dose-dependent manner by a bactericidal mode of action. A partial inhibitory spectrum analysis revealed that the following organisms were sensitive to the inhibitory activity of Bac1829: S. aureus RN4220, Streptococcus suis, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, C. renale, Corynebacterium diptheriae, Haemophilus parasuis, Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella bronchoseptica, Moraxella bovis, and Pasteurella multocida.

We emphasize three aspects: 1) the rarity of associated epidural abscess and bilateral psoas abscesses, 2) the rarity of the germ isolated (Streptococcus bovis), and 3) the diagnostic difficulties when both processes are associated, particularly in patients with an underlying disease that may simulate other common, clinical pictures.
TI  - Use of fura-2/AM to measure intracellular free calcium in Selenomonas ruminantium.
AB  - This paper describes a procedure for loading the acetoxymethyl ester of fura-2 (fura-2/AM), and the subsequent measurement of the concentration of intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) in Selenomonas ruminantium (S. ruminantium) using this technique. To ascertain the optimal loading conditions, the effect was examined on the loading of fura-2/AM of ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA), lysozyme, pluronic F127 alone, or the simultaneous application of EDTA and pluronic F127. Individual administration of either EDTA, lysozyme or pluronic F127 did not produce an optimal loading of fura-2/ AM. The co-application of pluronic F127 and bovine serum albumin after treatment with EDTA increased the ratio of the fluorescence due to excitation at 340 nm to that at 380 nm (R340/380) markedly, with a high signal intensity for intracellular fura-2, indicating that adequate loading had been obtained. Using the present loading method, it was found that the resting free [Ca2+]i of S. ruminantium was 48.1 +/- 2.2 nM (n = 6). This is approximately one half that found in Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, Streptococcus bovis and eucaryote cells. This is the first measurement of free [Ca2+]i using fura-2/AM in the Gram-negative strict anaerobe S. ruminantium.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with alcoholic  cirrhosis.
AB  - Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a frequent cause of decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis. The authors describe the first two cases caused by infection with Streptococcus bovis. They suggest that this microorganism may be present in the intestinal flora of these patients more frequently than assumed. Furthermore, the course of SBP due to S. bovis may be particularly severe.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a malic enzyme from the ruminal bacterium Streptococcus bovis ATCC 15352 and cloning and sequencing of its gene.
AB  - Malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.39), which catalyzes L-malate oxidative decarboxylation and pyruvate reductive carboxylation, was purified to homogeneity from Streptococcus bovis ATCC 15352, and properties of this enzyme were determined. The 2.9-kb fragment containing the malic enzyme gene was cloned, and the sequence was determined and analyzed. The enzymatic properties of the S. bovis malic enzyme were almost identical to those of other malic enzymes previously reported. However, we found that the S. bovis malic enzyme catalyzed unknown enzymatic reactions, including reduction of 2-oxoisovalerate, reduction of 2-oxoisocaproate, oxidation of D-2-hydroxyisovalerate, and oxidation of D-2-hydroxyisocaproate. The requirement for cations and the optimum pH of these unique activities were different from the requirement for cations and the optimum pH of the L-malate oxidative decarboxylating activity. A sequence analysis of the cloned fragment revealed the presence of two open reading frames that were 1,299 and 1,170 nucleotides long. The 389-amino-acid polypeptide deduced from the 1,170-nucleotide open reading frame was identified as the malic enzyme; this enzyme exhibited high levels of similarity to malic enzymes of Bacillus stearothermophilus and Haemophilus influenzae and was also similar to other malic enzymes and the malolactic enzyme of Lactococcus lactis.
TI  - In vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500) against a large collection of infrequently isolated or tested species.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500, Synercid) is a parenteral streptogramin combination antimicrobial that possesses a synergistic and often bactericidal action against many Grampositive species. In this study, a collection of 1270 uncommonly isolated or tested strains were evaluated for susceptibility to quinupristin/dalfopristin using agar dilution minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods described in the National Committe for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The greatest antimicrobial activity observed for quinupristin/dalfopristin was against staphylococci, streptococci, the pathogenic neisseria, Legionella spp., Lactobacillus spp., and Peptostreptococcus spp. (MIC90 range, 0.5-2 micrograms/ml). Marginal activity (MIC90s, 4 to 8 micrograms/ml) was identified for the rarer enterococci, Leuconostoc spp., Pediococcus spp., and Streptococcus bovis. Against Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Fusobacterium spp., and Prevotella spp., the streptogramin was inactive. Although no susceptible breakpoint has been approved for quinupristin/dalfopristin, three possible breakpoints (< or = 1, < or = 2, or < or = 4 micrograms/mL) were evaluated. Acceptance of the lower breakpoints (< or = 1 or < or = 2 micrograms/mL) would limit quinupristin/dalfopristin use to staphylococci, streptococci, gonococci, meningococci, and Legionella spp. These results markedly expand the understanding of the usable spectrum of quinupristin/dalfopristin.
TI  - The effect of amino nitrogen on the energetics of ruminal bacteria and its impact on energy spilling.
AB  - The predominant ruminal bacteria that were obtained from a 10(8) dilution of ruminal fluid could be maintained as a mixed population for long periods as long as the bacteria were provided with a complex mixture of carbohydrates. Growth of predominant ruminal bacteria in carbohydrate-limited, ammonia-excess, continuous cultures (0.07/h) had a low requirement for maintenance energy, but the nongrowth energy dissipation of ammonia-limited, carbohydrate-excess, predominant ruminal bacteria was approximately 10-fold higher (0.96 vs. 0.09 mg of hexose equivalent/mg of protein per h, respectively). Mathematical derivations indicated that this additional nongrowth energy dissipation could be accommodated by an energy spilling function that was independent of the growth rate. Peptides and amino acids had little impact on the yield of carbohydrate-limited, ammonia-excess, continuous cultures (0.07/ h), but amino N greatly increased the growth rate and yield of excess-energy batch cultures. The change in growth rate and yield that was dependent on amino N indicated that the energy-excess batch cultures had the same capacity to spill energy as did the ammonia-limited, carbohydrate-excess, predominant ruminal bacteria (0.80 vs. 0.86 mg of hexose equivalent/mg of protein per h, respectively). When the energy-excess batch cultures were provided with amino N, the growth rate increased, the difference in anabolic and catabolic rates was smaller, and less energy was spilled.
TI  - Rapid identification of Streptococcus and Enterococcus species using diffuse reflectance-absorbance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and artificial neural networks.
AB  - Diffuse reflectance-absorbance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was used to analyse 19 hospital isolates which had been identified by conventional means to one Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, Streptococcus bovis, S. mitis, S. pneumoniae, or S. pyogenes. Principal components analysis of the FT-IR spectra showed that this 'unsupervised' learning method failed to form six separable clusters (one of each species) and thus could not be used to identify these bacteria base on their FT-IR spectra. By contrast, artificial neural networks (ANNs) could be trained by 'supervised' learning (using the back-propagation algorithm) with the principal components scores of derivatised spectra to recognise the strains from their FT-IR spectra. These results demonstrate that the combination of FT-IR and ANNs provides a rapid, novel and accurate bacterial identification technique.
TI  - A Role for Fructose 1,6-Diphosphate in the ATPase-Mediated Energy-Spilling Reaction of Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - The amount of ATP produced by Streptococcus bovis was larger than the amount that could be attributed to growth and maintenance, and even glucose-limited continuous cultures used ATP inefficiently (spilled ATP). Rapid-dilution-rate cultures always spilled more ATP than those growing at slow dilution rates, but rates of ATP spilling could also be enhanced by amino acid deprivation (with only ammonia as a nitrogen source). Energy spilling and intracellular ATP were not correlated, but energy spilling was always greatest when the rate of lactate production was high. The relationship between lactate production and energy spilling was supported by the observation that amino acid deprivation increased lactate production and ATP spilling. The lactate production rate of nongrowing (energy-spilling) S. bovis cells was fructose 1,6-diphosphate (FDP) dependent, and previous work showed that the lactate dehydrogenase of S. bovis was activated by FDP (M. J. Wolin, Science 146:775-777, 1964). The role of FDP in energy spilling was supported by the observation that the membrane-bound ATPase of S. bovis could be stimulated by FDP. FDP decreased the K(infm) for ATP by as much as fivefold. Other glycolytic intermediates could not stimulate the ATPase of washed membrane preparations, and FDP had no effect on soluble ATPase activity.
TI  - Comparison of infective endocarditis in patients with and without previously recognized heart disease.
AB  - In a consecutive series of patients with infective endocarditis, we compared the  charts of 123 nonaddicted patients without previously known heart disease with those of 174 patients with native valve disease. The 2 groups were similar in age, sex, clinical findings, and mortality rates, but infective endocarditis was more often located on the aortic valve, more often due to Streptococcus bovis and enterococci in patients without previously known heart disease.
TI  - Detection and localization of peptidases in Lactococcus lactis with monoclonal antibodies.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies against peptidases of Lactococcus lactis were isolated and  characterized: PEPN1-4 against a lysyl aminopeptidase PepN, PEPT1-5 against a tripeptidase PepT and PEPD1-3 against a dipeptidase PepD. These monoclonal antibodies reacted specifically with their respective antigens in crude cell extracts of Lc. lactis subspp. cremoris and lactis. A number of monoclonal antibodies cross reacted with proteins of other (lactic acid) bacteria. PEPT1, 2, 4 and 5 cross reacted weakly with a 35 kDa protein in Lactobacillus delbrueckii, while PEPT1 and PEPT2 reacted with proteins in the cell-free extract of Streptococcus thermophilus and Clostridium fervidus. Of the four isolated monoclonal antibodies against PEPN, only PEPN3 cross reacted weakly with a 90 kDa protein in Escherichia coli cell-free extract, and the other three antibody species against PEPN3 cross reacted with 80 kDa proteins of Lb. casei, Lb. delbrueckii, and Str. bovis, but not of Esch. coli. Of the three monoclonal antibodies against PepD, only PEPD1 and PEPD2 cross reacted with 40 kDa proteins of Lb. casei, Lb. delbrueckii and Str. bovis. All PEPN, PEPD and PEPT antibodies reacted with components in cell-free extracts of eleven different Lc. lactis strains, indicating that the peptidases of these strains were very similar to those of Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris WG2. However, Lc. lactis subsp. hordniae appeared to differ from the other Lc. lactis subspecies since only PEPT1, 2 and 5 reacted with a protein in the cell-free extract. Immunogold labelling of Lc. lactis WG2 with the isolated monoclonal antibodies revealed that PepN, PepD and PepT were located intracellularly. The intracellular location of these peptidases is discussed in relation to the supply of essential amino acids and peptides.
TI  - [Sepsis due to Streptococcus bovis].
AB  
TI  - The prevalence of mastitis in primiparous heifers in eleven Waikato dairy herds.
AB  - The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence of mastitis among primiparous heifers at calving and at drying off in 11 Waikato dairy herds during the 1993-94 dairy production season. Duplicate quarter milk samples were collected aseptically from 458 heifers within 5 days after calving for bacteriological analysis. Mastitis was diagnosed in at least one quarter in 35.6% of these heifers. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were isolated from 21.8% of the heifers. The prevalence of coagulase-negative staphylococci varied between herds from 4.3% to 44.8%. Environmental streptococci caused mastitis in 12.2% of heifers, ranging from 5.6% to 24.1% between herds. Streptococcus uberus was the pathogen identified most frequently at calving and accounted for more than 90% of the streptococcal isolates. Staphylococcus aureus and coliforms were isolated from less than 1% of samples. Clinical mastitis was observed in 8.1% of heifers at calving; environmental streptococci were isolated from 67.6% of these clinical clinical cases. Only 2.8% of heifers developed clinical mastitis during lactation and environmental streptococci were isolated from 38.5% of these cases. The prevalence of mastitis among 428 of the heifers at drying off was 64.7%; a 1.8 fold increase during lactation. Corynebactetium bovis was isolated from 43% of heifers at drying off even though it was not isolated from any heifers at calving. During the season, the prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus mastitis increased to 2.8% while mastitis caused by environmental streptococci declined to 2.8%. The prevalence of environmental mastitis pathogens decreased during lactation while contagious pathogens increased in each of the 11 herds. Ineffective post-milking teat sanitation probably contributed to the increase in mastitis caused by contagious pathogens. Specific factors were not determined that affected the variation in prevalence between herds.
TI  - Purification and properties of extracellular glucosyltransferase from Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - Eight Streptococcus bovis strains were classified into 3 types on the basis of isoelectric point (pI) and molecular mass (M(r)) of extracellular glucosyltransferase. Strains ATCC 9809, 35034 and 43143 produced glucosyltransferase of pI 3.7 and M(r) 165 kDa; strains ATCC 15351, 27960 and 33317 produced glucosyltransferase of pI 4.1 and M(r) 140 kDa; strains ATCC 43085 and 43144 did not produce any glucosyltransferase. The glucosyltransferase form S. bovis 9809 was purified by Bio-Gel hydroxyapatite chromatography and DEAE-Toyopearl chromatography. The S. bovis 9809 glucosyltransferase was immunologically identical with the other 5 S. bovis glucosyltransferases and not related to mutants streptococcal glucosyltransferases. The specific activity, the optimum pH and the Km value for sucrose were 17.9 U/mg protein, 6.0 and 5.0 mM, respectively. The first 11 N-terminal amino acid residues of the glucosyltransferases were DETSAVTLTRE, and the region was hydrophilic. The glucosyltransferases from S. bovis 9809 and 3317 synthesized from sucrose 1, 6-alpha-D-glucan with 9 and 2 mol%, 1, 3, 6-alpha-branched glucose, respectively.
TI  - Inducer expulsion is not a determinant of diauxic growth in Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - When Streptococcus bovis JB1 was repeatedly transferred in a medium that contained the non-metabolizable glucose analog, 2-deoxyglucose, it lost its phosphotransferase system (PTS) for glucose but was still able to take up glucose via a facilitated diffusion mechanism. The wild type (JB1) had an inducible enzyme II lactose, but the mutant (JB1(2DG)) had a constitutive lactose PTS. JB1(2DG) was no longer able to exclude lactose when it was provided with glucose, but it retained its ability to expel a non-metabolizable lactose analog. Because JB1(2DG) could utilize glucose and lactose simultaneously and grow in a non-diauxic fashion, it appeared that inducer expulsion was not an important catabolite regulatory mechanism. Based on these results, inducer expulsion may be an artifact of non-metabolizable sugars.
TI  - Polymerase chain reaction of bacterial genomes with single universal primer: application to distinguishing mycobacteria species.
AB  - The polymerase chain reaction with a single universal primer (UP-PCR) was applied to bacterial strains and mycobacteria isolates alongside conventional methods. A universal protocol of preparation of PCR samples from cultures representing Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis, and several non-tuberculous mycobacteria was found to be reproducible and efficient with these organisms. The bands of UP-PCR products observed in an agarose gel after electrophoresis were species-specific and provided an efficient means of distinguishing bacterial species. The applicability of this approach to mycobacteria identification was assessed by comparing the DNA bands obtained for different strains. Three reference strains and 22 clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis and M. bovis produced very similar DNA banding patterns. They comprised a triplet of prominent and several minor fragments within the 200-500 base pair (bp) size range and were the easiest to interpret. The DNA profiles of unrelated mycobacteria clearly differed from each other when subjected to electrophoretic analysis and correlated well with results of culture method. The method provides a real promise of its application in clinical studies as a simple assay for distinguishing between tubercle bacilli.
TI  - Highly expressed human sialyl Lewis antigen on cell surface of streptococcus gallolyticus.
AB  
TI  - Inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an HPr(Ser-P)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-P), has been documented for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus bovis, and Lactococcus lactis, but not for other Gram-positive bacteria. Using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that Enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated ATP-dependent HPr(Ser) kinase that phosphorylates Ser-46 in HPr of the phosphotransferase system. A small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, HPr(Ser-P)-activated sugar-P phosphatase (Pase II), previously identified only in Lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, or Bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. Further, Lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks Pase II. The results reveal that Pase II is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-P hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. They provide correlative evidence that Pase II initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis endocarditis and vertebral osteomyelitis.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis recovered from blood cultures may represent bacteremia alone, bacteremia from an extravascular source, or endocarditis. Patients with S. bovis endocarditis frequently have a gastrointestinal focus. S. bovis has been associated with many gastrointestinal diseases and in particular with colon carcinoma. S. bovis endocarditis may be complicated by embolic events or osteomyelitis. Vertebral osteomyelitis is a rare complication of S. bovis endocarditis. We report the third known case of S. bovis endocarditis with vertebral osteomyelitis.
TI  - Transformation of Streptococcus bovis protoplasts by plasmid DNA.
AB  - The transformation and subsequent regeneration of ruminal strain Streptococcus bovis AO24/85 protoplasts by plasmid DNA was studied. The best stabilizer for regeneration of protoplasted cells was 5% sucrose in the regeneration medium and in the agar plates. Optimal concentration of polyethylene glycol 6000 in the transformation medium was 25% for both plasmids tested. Addition of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions (2.5 mmol l-1) to the transformation medium increased the proportion of regenerated cells. Transformation frequencies were 3 x 10(3) transformants per microgram of pNZ12 and 2.4 x 10(2) per microgram of pJK108, respectively.
TI  - Effects of freezing on the viability of nine pathogens from quarters with subclinical mastitis.
AB  - Milk samples from 45 quarters containing mastitis pathogens were collected from lactating cows to determine the viability of those pathogens after freezing. An initial bacteria count was conducted, and samples were divided into 2-ml portions and frozen. Weekly bacteria counts were conducted for 6 wk. Viability after freezing was determined on five isolates of nine bacterial species: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hyicus, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus xylosus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Corynebacterium bovis, and Escherichia coli. Bacteria counts were converted to logarithm base 10, and analysis of variance was conducted to determine alterations in viability over the 6-wk period. Freezing of quarter milk samples for 6 wk did not affect viability of any of these pathogens.
TI  - Breakdown of peptides from a casein hydrolysate by rumen bacteria. Simultaneous study of enzyme activities and physicochemical parameters.
AB  - The breakdown of a pancreatic hydrolysate of casein (tryptone) by an inoculum of  ruminal mixed bacteria was studied in vitro. Peptides were degradated at 33% after 5 h. The dipeptidyl aminopeptidase type 1 (DAP-1), exoaminopeptidase and leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) like activities were measured using, respectively, Gly-Arg-MNA, Ala-pNa and Leu-pNA as substrates. While the total proteolytic activity remained stable throughout peptide breakdown, the DAP-1 already present at the beginning of fermentation increased until two times its early activity. This peptidase activity is a major index for the presence of Prevotella ruminicola. A peak of exoaminopeptidase and LAP activities were observed at 3 h incubation. This latter activity, which was associated with the production of lactate after 3 h, suggested that Streptococcus bovis was present in the environment. With the use of high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC), the size of the peptides during their breakdown could be measured, showing that high molecular weight peptides (4 to 2 kDa) were apparently more rapidly broken down to the profit of small-sized peptides (< 0.5 kDa), which increased. These degradation abilities were closely linked to DAP-1 activity. Separation of tryptone peptides by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed that more hydrophilic peptides disappeared than hydrophobic peptides. Moreover, a few peaks eluting for one in the hydrophilic area and for the others in the hydrophobic area resisted the bacterial breakdown. In contrast, amino acid profiles indicated that hydrophobic amino acids were not taken up significantly faster than the hydrophobic amino acids by mixed ruminal bacterial.
TI  - [Serum bactericidal rate. Methodological proposal to predict the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy].
AB  - Several in vitro techniques have been developed, which are able to quantify the bactericidal activity of a determined antibacterial drug against an infective agent. The Serum Bactericidal Rate (SBR) is proposed as a complementary technique for the determination of the "killing curve", the serum bactericidal test or the minimal bactericidal concentration. SBR takes into account the most advantageous features of both of them. SBR is based on quantifying at different times the survival of the bacterial inoculum exposed to the patient's serum. Thus, bactericide speed is evaluated in the first hours of contact with the microorganism (as in the "killing curve"), but taking into account drug concentrations which have been reached by the patient (as in the serum bactericidal test). Preliminary assays suggest that SBR may have greater capacity to discriminate an infectious agent in answer to different therapeutic schemes than other determinations, although prospective studies are required to evaluate its predictive value.
TI  - Isolated tricuspid valve endocarditis due to Streptococcus bovis.
AB  
TI  - Field trial evaluation of two teat dips containing nisin or polyvinylpyrrolidone  iodophor designed for use before and after milking.
AB  - In a first trial involving six commercial dairy herds and 291 cows for a period of eight months, pre-milking udder sanitation by dipping teats in a 0.25% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) iodophor product followed by wiping with paper towels was compared in each herd with traditional teat washing and wiping with individual udder cloths. The incidence of new intramammary infections by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis and Corynebacterium bovis were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced, respectively by 48%, 60% and 47%. There were no significant differences in the two groups of cows for other intramammary infections, total bacterial counts, clostridia spore counts, iodine residues in milk or teat condition scores. In a second trial involving nine commercial dairy herds and 367 cows for a period of seven months, a teat dip containing nisin used before and after milking was compared in each herd with a classical 0.5% iodophor product used in the same way. There was no significant difference in the incidence of new intramammary infections, in spite of a higher rate of new Staphylococcus aureus infections in the group of cows teat-dipped with the nisin product (P = 0.06). It was concluded that pre-dipping with teat dips specifically designed to be safely used before milking can be more efficient than traditional pre-milking udder preparation. These teat dips, when used before and after milking, seem to be as efficient as products which should normally be restricted to post-milking use.
TI  - [Streptococcus bovis as the cause of combined endocarditis of the aortic, mitral  and tricuspid valves].
AB  - A case of combined endocarditis of the aortic-, mitral- and tricuspid valves in an otherwise healthy cattle farmer is described. The infective agent was Streptococcus bovis. The relation between S. bovis infection and endocarditis is discussed.
TI  - Antibiotic treatment of adults with infective endocarditis due to streptococci, enterococci, staphylococci, and HACEK microorganisms. American Heart Association.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide guidelines for the treatment of endocarditis in adults caused by the following microorganisms: viridans streptococci and other streptococci, enterococci, staphylococci, and fastidious gram-negative bacilli of the HACEK group. PARTICIPANTS: An ad hoc writing group appointed by the American Heart Association under the auspices of the Committee on Rheumatic Fever, Endocarditis, and Kawasaki Disease, Council on Cardiovascular Disease in the Young. EVIDENCE: Published studies of the treatment of patients with endocarditis and the collective clinical experience of this group of experts. CONSENSUS PROCESS: The recommendations were formulated during meetings of the working group and were prepared by a writing committee after the group had agreed on the specific therapeutic regimens. The consensus statement was subsequently reviewed by standing committees of the American Heart Association and by a group of experts not affiliated with the working group. CONCLUSIONS: Sufficient evidence has been published that recommendations regarding treatment of the most common microbiological causes of endocarditis (viridans streptococci, enterococci, Streptococcus bovis, staphylococci, and the HACEK organisms) are justified. There are insufficient published data to make a strong statement regarding the efficacy of specific therapeutic regimens for cases of endocarditis due to microorganisms that uncommonly cause endocarditis. As a useful aid to the practicing clinician, the writing group developed a consensus opinion regarding management of endocarditis caused by the most commonly encountered microorganisms and regarding those cases due to infrequent causes of endocarditis.
TI  - Treatment of streptococcal endocarditis with a single daily dose of ceftriaxone and netilmicin for 14 days: a prospective multicenter study.
AB  - A 2-week course of ceftriaxone (2 g) plus netilmicin (4 mg/kg), administered as one short daily iv infusion, was evaluated for the treatment of streptococcal endocarditis in an open multicenter study. Of the 52 patients, 31 were infected with viridans streptococci, 18 with Streptococcus bovis, two with Gemella morbillorum, and one with group C Streptococcus; 48 patients were assessable. Infection was cured in 42 cases, 35 treated medically and seven treated both medically and surgically. Five patients died without evidence of active infection, and one relapsed. The bacteriologic failure was due to a strain of G. morbillorum against which no synergy of ceftriaxone and netilmicin was evident in vitro. The serum creatinine level increased during treatment in four cases, all involving patients > 65 years old who had renal risk factors; in two of these cases, values did not return to baseline during follow-up. Of 40 patients assessed for auditory function, only one developed decreased perception of borderline significance. Other adverse reactions were mild. This regimen was efficacious, safe, and cost-effective for the treatment of streptococcal endocarditis. However, it must be used with caution for patients with preexisting renal impairment or concomitant exposure to other potentially nephrotoxic agents.
TI  - Infective endocarditis due to Streptococcus bovis. A report of 53 cases.
AB  - Fifty-three patients (42 men; 11 women) with Streptococcus bovis infective endocarditis attended a tertiary cardiology hospital between 1980 and 1991, and constituted 11% of the total number of infective endocarditis cases hospitalized there during that period. The mean age was 59 +/- 15 years; 15 had previously suffered valvular disease (12) or had a valvular prosthesis (3); one patient had had a previous infective endocarditis. The infective episode involved the aortic valve in 26 patients, both the aortic and mitral valves in 18 patients, the mitral valve only in six and other valves in three. Echocardiographic examination showed one or more vegetations in 44 patients. Cardiac failure was diagnosed in 35 patients and embolic episodes in 22, of whom 11 were cerebrovascular accidents. The patients became afebrile 19 +/- 39 days after starting antibiotic treatment. Valve replacement was performed in 37 patients during their initial hospitalization, and in four during follow-up. After a mean follow-up of 4.6 +/- 3.1 years with a 100% follow-up, 15 patients died: 1 preoperatively, one in the first 30 days after operation, 13 later (8141 operated patients and 5/12 non-operated patients). Actuarial survival was 73% at 5 years. Gastrointestinal signs were present in 12 patients; 43 patients (81%) had a full colonic examination which showed polyps in 20 patients and adenocarcinomas in seven. Of 11 late deaths four were related to a malignant colonic tumour. This study confirms that Streptococcus bovis infective endocarditis is 'relatively benign', but it stresses the frequency and potential severity of the associated colonic lesions, requiring colonoscopy and making the treatment of high risk lesions mandatory.
TI  - Evaluation of the automicrobic system for the identification of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The performance of the Automicrobic System with the Vitek gram-positive identification card (bioMerieux, France) in identifying strains of Streptococcus mutans was studied. Of 160 strains assayed, 72.5% were confirmed to be Streptococcus mutans; the remainder were identified as other species of streptocci (Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus sanguis I and II, Streptococcus intermedius, and Streptococcus constellatus).
TI  - Properties of two sugar phosphate phosphatases from Streptococcus bovis and their potential involvement in inducer expulsion.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis possesses two sugar phosphate phosphatases (Pases). Pase I is a soluble enzyme that is inhibited by the membrane fractions from lactose-grown cells and is insensitive to activation by S46D HPr, an analog of HPr(ser-P) of the sugar phosphotransferase system. Pase II is a membrane-associated enzyme that can be activated 10-fold by S46D HPr, and it appears to play a role in inducer expulsion.
TI  - [Streptococcus bovis in a surgical wound and a colonic neoplasm].
AB  - The association of colorectal carcinoma and septicemia or endocarditis by Streptococcus bovis is well known. Nonetheless, other localizations of infection by Streptococcus bovis have not been associated with colorectal carcinoma. The case of association of colon neoplasm with infection by Streptococcus bovis localized in the surgical wound of resection of a prostate adenoma by the transvesical route carried out four months previously is presented. Possible intraoperative bacteremia colonizing the surgical wound due to colic compression during surgery may have been the cause. This localization of infection by Streptococcus bovis should be taken into account in screening of colorectal carcinoma.
TI  - Differentiation of ruminal and human Streptococcus bovis strains by DNA homology  and 16s rRNA probes.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis is commonly present in the rumen, but strains of S. bovis have also occasionally been isolated from human blood or fecal samples. Studies were undertaken with 16s rRNA gene sequences and DNA hybridizations to define the genetic relationships between these two groups of strains. Ruminal strains were found to yield genomic DNA restriction endonuclease digest patterns different from human strains when either the 16s rRNA gene amplified from ruminal S. bovis strain JB1 or a conserved universal 23s rRNA fragment was used as probes. A DNA probe based on the V1 region of the 16s rRNA of S. bovis JB1 was found to hybridize to DNAs of other ruminal S. bovis strains (K27FF4, 21-09-6C, five new ruminal isolates, and weak hybridization was found with DNAs from S. bovis 33317 (type strain), S. equinus 9812, and six other ruminal isolates. No hybridization occurred with strains representing different major human biotypes/homology groups (43143, 43144, 27960, V1387). All ruminal S. bovis strains had a guanosine plus cytosine DNA content of 37.4-38.8 mol% and, based on DNA-DNA genomic hybridizations, could be separated into two homology groups, one of which included S. equinus 9812 and S. bovis 33317. Both ruminal groups had less than 38% DNA homology to the human strains, indicating ruminal strains are clearly two separate species distinct from the human strains.
TI  - A gene-targeting suicide vector for Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - A gene-targeting suicide vector for Streptococcus bovis has been constructed using the Escherichia coli/Streptococcus shuttle plasmid, pMU1328, and a region derived from the broad host-range, Gram-positive transposon, Tn916. This suicide plasmid replicates autonomously in E. coli, but not in Strep. bovis or Strep. bovis Tn916. Under positive selection, the plasmid was shown to integrate into Strep. bovis Tn916 chromosomal DNA at a frequency of 3 x 10(-8) cell-1 and was stably maintained for at least 100 generations in the absence of selection. This is the first report of a recombination system in ruminal bacteria. The ability to target genes, knock out specific functions or introduce novel genes into these micro-organisms will allow ruminal species to be manipulated and may eventually lead to improved animal production.
TI  - Spontaneous peritonitis caused by Streptococcus bovis: search for colonic neoplasia.
AB  
TI  - Carcinoma of the colon presenting as Streptococcus sanguis bacteremia.
AB  - Bacteremia by streptococci that normally inhabit the gastrointestinal tract has been associated with colon carcinoma. Such association is best known for Streptococcus bovis, but has also been reported for other streptococci. In the present communication a patient is described who presented with Streptococcus sanguis bacteremia and was subsequently found to suffer from an adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid. A possible association between bacteremia by commensal streptococci of both the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract and colon carcinoma is discussed.
TI  - Regulation of the lactose phosphotransferase system of Streptococcus bovis by glucose: independence of inducer exclusion and expulsion mechanisms.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis had a diauxic pattern of glucose and lactose utilization, and both of these sugars were transported by the sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS). Lactose catabolism was inducible, and S. bovis used the tagatose pathway to ferment lactose. Since a mutant that was deficient in glucose PTS activity transported lactose as fast as the wild-type, it appeared that S. bovis has separate enzyme IIs for glucose and lactose. The nonmetabolizable glucose analogue 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) was a noncompetitive inhibitor of methyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (TMG) transport, and cells that were provided with either glucose or 2-DG were unable to transport TMG or lactose. Because the glucose-PTS-deficient mutant could ferment glucose, but could not exclude TMG, it appeared that enzyme IIGlc rather than glucose catabolism per se was the critical feature of inducer exclusion. Cells that had accumulated TMG as TMG 6-phosphate expelled free TMG when glucose was added, but 2-DG was unable to cause TMG expulsion. The glucose-PTS-deficient mutant could still expel TMG in the presence of exogenous glucose. Membrane vesicles also exhibited glucose-dependent TMG exclusion and TMG expulsion. Membrane vesicles that were electroporated with phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and HPr retained TMG for more than 3 min, but vesicles that were electroporated with PEP plus HPr and fructose 1,6-diphosphate (FDP) (or glycerate 2-phosphate) lost their ability to retain TMG. Because FDP was able to trigger the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of HPr, it appeared that inducer expulsion was mediated by an FDP-activated protein kinase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Streptococcus bovis-infected total hip arthroplasty.
AB  - The case of a 51-year-old man who underwent a total hip arthroplasty following failed AO screw fixation of a subcapital femoral neck fracture is reported. Infection of the prosthesis with Streptococcus bovis type 1 followed a febrile illness. Further investigation revealed an occult premalignant polyp in the proximal colon. Colonic neoplasia and S. bovis bacteremia are associated with endocarditis; however, S. bovis is a rare pathogen infecting joint prostheses and should raise the possibility of a gastrointestinal lesion.
TI  - Identification of proteolytic rumen bacteria isolated from New Zealand cattle.
AB  - The protease activities of 212 strains of rumen bacteria isolated from New Zealand cattle grazing pasture were measured. Thirty-seven per cent of strains had activity greater than or equal to the proteolytic rumen bacterium Prevotella ruminicola and 43 of these isolates were identified by morphology, carbon source utilization, Gram stain, biochemical tests and fermentation end-product analysis. Hierarchical Cluster Analysis showed that the strains formed four clusters: cluster A contained 26 strains and clustered with a reference strain of Streptococcus bovis; cluster C contained three strains and clustered with a reference strain of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, while clusters B (10 strains) and D (three strains) did not cluster with any of the remaining rumen bacterial type strains. Further tests identified strains of cluster B as Eubacterium budayi, while cluster D strains most closely resembled B. fibrisolvens and were described as B. fibrisolvens-like. An unclustered strain, C21a, was identified as P. ruminicola. The significance of these proteolytic bacterial populations is discussed in relation to protein breakdown in New Zealand ruminants.
TI  - Intracellular survival and multiplication of virulent and less virulent strains of Streptococcus bovis in pigeon macrophages.
AB  - The intracellular fate of pigeon S. bovis strains ingested by macrophages was studied in vivo and in vitro. During in vivo experiments, histological and electron microscopical examinations demonstrated numerous cocci, which appeared to be actively multiplying, within splenic macrophages of pigeons experimentally inoculated with a highly virulent S. bovis serotype 1 strain. In pigeons inoculated with a low virulence serotype 3 strain, intracellular cocci were only occasionally observed. For in vitro experiments, pigeon peritoneal macrophages were inoculated with a S. bovis serotype 1 or serotype 3 strain and incubated. Following an initial decrease, an increase in the number of intracellular bacteria was observed in tests performed with the S. bovis serotype 1 strain, demonstrating intracellular multiplication. Macrophages in these experiments had all died after 7 h of incubation, possibly indicating that the intracellular replication of S. bovis resulted in the release of substances toxic for macrophages. In experiments performed with the S. bovis serotype 3 strain, the number of intracellular bacteria continuously decreased, reflecting killing of organisms. Significant changes in the number of adhering macrophages in S. bovis serotype 3 inoculated cultures were not observed. These results indicate S. bovis in pigeons is a facultative intracellular bacterium and intracellular multiplication may be involved in virulence.
TI  - Contaminated toothbrushes and their disinfection.
AB  - Twenty toothbrushes used by healthy subjects were screened for the presence of microorganisms. Microbes were dislodged from the brushes by vortexing, and an average of 4 x 10(3) CFU/mL were recovered from the suspending fluid. Bristles removed from the vortexed brushes still yielded confluent bacterial growth on brain-heart infusion agar medium. Virkon (one per cent), Listerine, Cepacol, Scope, and Plax were tested for their bactericidal effects on microorganisms sedimented from the suspending fluid, on toothbrush bristles and proxabrushes, and on various test species including Candida albicans, Mycobacterium smegmatis, M. bovis, and Streptococcus mitis. Virkon and Listerine killed all the test species and virtually all the microorganisms on the toothbrush bristles and proxabrushes. Six volunteers tested the efficacy of a Listerine soaking regime to prevent the bacterial contamination of toothbrushes. Soaking the toothbrush head (bristles) in Listerine for 20 minutes after brushing was sufficient to eliminate bacterial contamination.
TI  - Cellodextrin efflux by the cellulolytic ruminal bacterium Fibrobacter succinogenes and its potential role in the growth of nonadherent bacteria.
AB  - When glucose or cellobiose was provided as an energy source for Fibrobacter succinogenes, there was a transient accumulation (as much as 0.4 mM hexose equivalent) of cellobiose or cellotriose, respectively, in the growth medium. Nongrowing cell suspensions converted cellobiose to cellotriose and longer-chain cellodextrins, and in this case the total cellodextrin concentration was as much as 20 mM (hexose equivalent). Because cell extracts of glucose- or cellobiose-grown cells cleaved cellobioise and cellotriose by phosphate-dependent reactions and glucose 1-phosphate was an end product, it appeared that cellodextrins were being produced by a reversible phosphorylase reaction. This conclusion was supported by the observation that the ratio of cellodextrins to cellodextrins with one greater hexose [n/(n + 1)] was approximately 4, a value similar to the equilibrium constant (Keq) of cellobiose phosphorylase (J. K. Alexander, J. Bacteriol. 81:903-910, 1961). When F. succinogenes was grown in a cellobiose-limited chemostat, cellobiose and cellotriose could both be detected, and the ratio of cellotriose to cellobiose was approximately 1 to 4. On the basis of these results, cellodextrin production is an equilibrium (mass action) function and not just an artifact of energy-rich cultural conditions. Cellodextrins could not be detected in low-dilution-rate, cellulose-limited continuous cultures, but these cultures had a large number of nonadherent cells. Because the nonadherent cells had a large reserve of polysaccharide and were observed at all stages of cell division, it appeared that they were utilizing cellodextrins as an energy source for growth.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Mycotic aneurysm of the posterior tibial artery and pseudo-phlebitis: contribution of color Doppler ultrasonography].
AB  - Mycotic aneurysm of the posterior tibial artery and pseudophlebitis: role of color Doppler sonography A case of a 78-year-old male patient presenting with endocarditis caused by Streptococcus bovis and pseudophlebitis of the left lower limb is described. Color Doppler sonography ruled out thrombophlebitis and showed a large pulsatile mass of the posterior compartment of the leg due to a mycotic aneurysm of the posterior tibial artery. This aneurysm was confirmed by angiography and treated by surgery. The important role of color Doppler sonography for the diagnosis of this particular case is emphasized.
TI  - [The isolation of Streptococcus morbillorum from vaginal exudates].
AB  - We have tested 195 vaginal secretions sent by Gynecology Service of this hospital between the years 1988-1990. We achieved positive culture for streptococci in 58 (30%) of these cultures, 26 (44.8%) corresponding to Streptococcus morbillorum 9 (15.5%), to Gardnerella vaginalis 5 (8.6%), to Enterococcus faecalis-durans and to Streptococcus agalactiae, 3 (5.1%) to Streptococcus mitis and milleri 2 (3.4%), to Streptococcus bovis and cremoris, and 1 (1.7%) to Streptococcus salivarius, equinus and sanguis II respectively. We previously found that 52.8% of these patients were positive for vaginal candidiasis. The bacteriological identification done by the API 20 STREP System (bioMerieux GmbH, Nutingen, Germany) provides a typical pattern ("good identification") for the Streptococcus morbillorum.
TI  - Determination of 16S rRNA sequences of Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus gordonii and phylogenetic relationships among members of the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - We determined the 16S rRNA sequences of the type strains of Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus gordonii and calculated the phylogenetic distances between those organisms and other members of the genus Streptococcus. The viridans group streptococci were separated into five phylogenetic groups; we named these groups the anginosus group, the mitis group, the salivarius group, the bovis group, and the mutans group. S. mitis and S. gordonii clustered in the mitis group together with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus parasanguis at levels of sequence homology of more than 96%. Within this group, S. mitis, S. oralis, and S. pneumoniae exhibited more than 99% sequence homology with each other, although the DNA-DNA similarity values for their total chromosome DNAs were less than 60%.
TI  - Identification of intracellular amylase activity in Streptococcus bovis and Streptococcus salivarius.
AB  - The ruminal bacterium Streptococcus bovis has been demonstrated to produce an extracellular amylase activity. We previously reported on the cloning of a gene from S. bovis encoding for what was initially believed to be the extracellular amylase. DNA sequence analyses indicated that the amylase produced by the cloned gene did not match the N-terminus amino acid sequence of the purified extracellular amylase and contained no apparent leader sequence for secretion. Analyses of crude extracts demonstrated the presence of an intracellular amylase in S. bovis JB1 that differed in molecular weight (56,000) from that of the extracellular amylase (70,000). The 56,000 molecular weight amylase was identical to the amylase produced by Escherichia coli containing the cloned amylase gene. Low levels of intracellular amylase activity were also detected in other strains of S. bovis and also Streptococcus salivarius. Introduction of the plasmid pVA838 containing the cloned amylase gene into S. bovis and S. sanguis resulted in enhanced intracellular amylase production by both organisms. The amylase gene has been sequenced, and analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence for the amylase indicates a high degree of similarity with secreted amylases from Bacillus species.
TI  - Heterologous expression of an endoglucanase gene (endA) from the ruminal anaerobe Ruminococcus flavefaciens 17 in Streptococcus bovis and Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - The heterologous expression of a cloned endoglucanase gene (endA) from the ruminal bacterium Ruminococcus flavefaciens 17 was demonstrated in the Streptococcus species S. bovis JB1 and S. sanguis DL1. The endA gene was introduced into S. bovis and S. sanguis using the Escherichia coli/Streptococcus shuttle vector pVA838. Expression of the gene was detected by clearing zones around the recombinant colonies on agar plates containing carboxymethylcellulose stained with Congo red. S. bovis JB1 containing the endA gene was capable of utilizing cellotetraose at a faster rate than the parent strain. This is the first demonstration that Streptococcus species can express a gene from a Ruminococcus flavefaciens strain.
TI  - The in vitro uptake and metabolism of peptides and amino acids by five species of rumen bacteria.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis JB1, Prevotella ruminicola B(1)4, Selenomonas ruminantium Z108, Fibrobacter succinogenes S85 and Anaerovibrio lipolytica 5S were incubated with either 14C-peptides (mol. wt, 200-1000) or 14C-amino acids to compare their rates of uptake and metabolism. In experiment 1, the bacteria were grown and incubated in a complex medium, but no uptake of 14C-labelled substrates occurred. When casein digest was omitted, uptake rates of 14C-peptides were different (P < 0.01) with each species, but nil for 14C-amino acids. In experiment 2, to minimize the effects of non-radiolabelled peptides and amino acids, defined and semi-defined media were used. Patterns of 14C-peptide uptake resembled those of experiment 1. The 5-min rate for Strep. bovis JB1 was almost twice that of P. ruminicola B(1)4, though by 15 min they were similar and threefold greater than other species; that of A. lipolytica 5S was especially low. Incubations with 14C-amino acids resulted in a wide range (P < 0.01) of uptake rates; after 5 min P. ruminicola B(1)4 possessed the lowest and Strep. bovis JB1 the highest, but after 15 min, that of Sel. ruminantium Z108 was even higher. All bacteria, with the exception of P. ruminicola B(1)4, assimilated 14C-amino acids faster (P < 0.01) than 14C-peptides. Only Strep. bovis JB1 and P. ruminicola B(1)4 were capable of extensively metabolizing 14C-peptides, but all five species metabolized 14C-amino acids; there was evidence of substantial degradation and some synthesis. Calculations suggest that peptides could supply up to 43%, and amino acids 62% of the N requirements of rumen bacteria.
TI  - Location of the alpha-amylase gene in rumen Streptococcus bovis strains distinguished by unstable amylase activity.
AB  - Genetic stability of amylase activity after serial subcultivation experiments with amylolytic ruminal Streptococcus bovis strains was investigated. Two strains Amy+ and Amy- were obtained. Loss of amylase activity connected with the loss of plasmid DNA was not found in these strains. The presence of the gene responsible for the amylase activity in the chromosome of these strains was revealed by hybridization of the alpha-amylase gene on pJK108 against chromosomal DNA of S. bovis and Bacillus subtilis after a complete restriction with EcoRI.
TI  - [Neurologic complications of infectious endocarditis].
AB  - Ten patients with neurological complications (NC) among a retrospective series of 53 consecutive cases of infective endocarditis were studied: 6 males and 4 females, mean age 60 years. NC were present at admission in 6 cases: 2 generalized seizures, 4 strokes, associated with 2 meningeal syndromes. Four cases of NC occurred during hospitalization: 1 stroke with come, 1 transient ischaemic attack, 2 generalized seizures. Blood cultures were positive in 7 cases: 6 group D Streptococci, 1 Gram negative bacillus. Five digestive portal of entry were identified. Cerebrospinal fluid was purulent in 1 patient, aseptic in 1, haemorragic in 2, and normal in 1. Cranial computed tomography revealed: infarct in 4 cases, brain abscess in 1 case, absence of abnormality in 1 case. There was no angiographic documentation. Antimicrobial therapy was maintained 5 to 6 weeks. Two patients underwent cardiac surgery. Two patients died of subarachnoid haemorrage. Comparison of patients with NC, and the 43 without NC, revealed two different point: vegetations were more frequent in the NC (8 cases out of 10) than without NC (19 cases out of 43) (p = 0.04). Streptoccus was often more found in NC (6 cases out of 6) than without NC (6 cases out of 24) (p < 0.01). Compared with the previously reported studies, where Staphylococcus was usually described, our results showed a higher frequency of Streptococcus D bovis, an older age, a higher frequency of stroke and digestive portal of entry. Vegetations were more frequent with NC than without.
TI  - Rumen fermentation and metabolic profile in conventional and gnotobiotic lambs.
AB  - Observations were carried out of actual acidity, volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations, enzyme activity in the rumen, total protein, urea, total lipid and glucose in the serum of conventional (CL) and gnotobiotic lambs (GL) in the period of milk nutrition. The inoculum of gnotobiotic lambs contained Streptococcus bovis, Prevoxella ruminicola, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and Selenomonas ruminantium at a concentration of 1.10(6) each. Throughout the observation period the pH of the rumen contents of gnotobiotic lambs ranged within 6.5-6.8 with a significant difference at an age of 7 weeks. Total VFA concentrations in the rumen contents were increased in the CL throughout milk nutrition: the differences at 4 and 5 weeks of age were significant. Total VFA in the conventional lambs revealed an increasing tendency between weeks 4 and 7, reaching higher levels at 7 weeks of age (57.1 mmol.l-1), whereas in the gnotobiotic animals the range (24.3-30.1 mmol.l-1) was narrow and the peak occurred at 6 weeks of age. In GL significantly increased molar proportions of acetic acid were observed whereas in CL the molar proportions of propionic acid proved to be significant increased. The molar proportions of butyric and valeric acids were increased in CL but the group differences were not significant. In GL no isoacids were found. Alpha amylase (E.C.3.2.1.1.) activity of the rumen contents was significantly increased in GL between weeks 2 and 6 of age whereas cellulase (endoglucanase E.C.3.2.1.4. and cellobiohydrolase E.C.3.2.1.91.) activity was significantly increased in 4-week-old CL. Over the whole period of milk nutrition no significant differences were observed in urease (E.C.3.5.1.5.) activity of the rumen contents in the examined groups. At 5 weeks of age significantly increased total protein levels were observed in the conventional animals with maximum levels occurring at 4 weeks of age (CL-59.5 g.l-1 GL-55.3 g.l-1). Urea levels in 6-week old conventional lambs were significantly higher than in the gnotobiotic animals (CL-6.4 mmol.l-1 vs. GL-1.9 mmol.l-1). As to glycaemia no significant group differences were recorded. In the conventional animals total lipid levels were significantly increased at 1 and 6 weeks of age with a peak occurring in the first week of life (7.5 g.l-1) whereas in the gnotobiotic lambs a significant increase was observed at 3 weeks of age, the peak being recorded in 4 week-old animals (4.3 g.l-1). Throughout the period of interest the mean daily weight gains in the conventional and gnotobiotic lambs presented 0.164 and 0.162 kg, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Survey of urease activity in ruminal bacteria isolated from domestic and wild ruminants.
AB  - A total of 909 strains, including Selenomonas ruminantium, Lactobacillus sp., Enterococcus sp. and Staphylococcus sp., from the rumen of 104 domestic and wild ruminants was used in tests for urease activity. Tests showed that 56.7% of S. ruminantium strains and 18.5% of lactobacilli manifested medium urease activity with mean values of 14.4 +/- 2.5 and 13.85 +/- 0.25 nkat ml-1, respectively. Most of the Enterococcus faecium (62.2%) and all of the E. faecalis isolates expressed urease activity with mean values of 3.9 +/- 0.05 and 4.1 +/- 0.06 nkat ml-1. E. malodoratus, E. solitarius, E. mundtii, Streptococcus bovis and S. uberis did not produce any urease. All the staphylococci screened were urease-producing strains, mostly with medium or low urease activity. The highest level of urease was measured in the rumen epithelial wall of isolates SE30 (19.7 +/- 2.71 nkat ml-1 of rumen content), SCU32 (29.3 +/- 1.6 nkat ml-1) and also in the rumen content isolates EF35 (19.9 +/- 0.94 nkat ml-1) and S. ruminantium 77 (25.35 nkat ml-1). This survey contributes new data to existing information relating to the ureolytic microbial ecosystem in ruminants.
TI  - Streptococcus sanguis bacteremia and colorectal cancer: a case report.
AB  - Streptococcus sanguis, usually considered a nonpathogen of the oral cavity, was isolated from blood cultures from a patient who was subsequently found to have a cecal adenocarcinoma. Further studies are needed to determine if Streptococcus sanguis infections have diagnostic implications similar to those of Streptococcus bovis.
TI  - Cyclic AMP in ruminal and other anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - An examination of cAMP levels in predominant species of ruminal bacteria and other anaerobic bacteria was conducted. Cellular cAMP concentrations of glucose-grown cultures of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49, Prevotella ruminicola D31d, Selenomonas ruminantium HD4 and D, Megasphaera elsdenii B159, Streptococcus bovis JB1, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron 5482, and Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 were determined at various times during growth by a competitive binding radioimmunoassay procedure. The results were compared to those for Escherichia coli NRRL B3704. The levels of cAMP ranged from undetectable for B. thetaiotaomicron to approximately 15 pmol/mg cell protein for P. ruminicola D31d. Varying the growth substrate in a manner previously shown to elicit regulatory response did not alter the level of cAMP in these organisms. In general, cAMP concentrations present in these organisms were much lower than the 6-25 pmol/mg cell protein observed for E. coli. The levels of cAMP in P. ruminicola were consistently higher than levels in other anaerobes, particularly during the early exponential and stationary phases of growth. Based on these data it seems unlikely that cAMP is involved in regulation of substrate catabolism in the anaerobic bacteria examined except in P. ruminicola where it may have an unknown regulatory function.
TI  - Protective humoral response against pneumococcal infection in mice elicited by recombinant bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccines expressing pneumococcal surface protein A.
AB  - Pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA), a cell-surface protein present on all strains of pneumococci, has been shown to elicit protective antibody responses in mice in the absence of capsular polysaccharide. Whereas PspA is polymorphic, considerable cross-reactivity and cross-protection have been demonstrated among PspA proteins of pneumococci exhibiting different capsular and PspA serotypes. A gene segment encoding the nonrepetitive variable NH2-terminal portion of PspA has been cloned into three distinct recombinant Bacille Calmette-Guerin (rBCG) vectors, allowing for expression of PspA as a cytoplasmic or secreted protein, or a chimeric exported membrane-associated lipoprotein. All rBCG-PspA strains elicited comparable anti-PspA ELISA titers, ranging from 10(4) to 10(5) (reciprocal titers) in both BALB/c and C3H/HeJ mice. However, protective responses were observed only in animals immunized with the rBCG-PspA vaccines expressing PspA as a secreted protein or chimeric exported lipoprotein. In addition, anti-PspA immune sera elicited by the rBCG vaccines passively protected X-linked immunodeficient mice from lethal challenge with the highly virulent, encapsulated WU2 strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae and two additional virulent strains exhibiting heterologous PspA and capsular serotypes. These studies confirm previous PspA immunization studies showing cross-protection against heterologous serotypes of S. pneumoniae and demonstrate a potential for rBCG-based PspA vaccines to elicit protective humoral responses against pneumococcal disease in humans.
TI  - Use of cephalexin-aztreonam-arabinose agar for selective isolation of Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Cephalexin-aztreonam-arabinose agar (CAA), a new selective agar, was examined in  comparison with nalidixic acid-colistin agar for the differentiation of Enterococcus faecium from other enterococci and the ability to isolate the organism from feces. Two hundred sixteen enterococcus isolates and a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative control strains were inoculated onto both media. All control strains of E. faecium were easily differentiated from Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus durans on the basis of arabinose fermentation on CAA. Differentiation of E. faecium from other enterococci or Streptococcus bovis was not possible on nalidixic acid-colistin agar. Increased isolation of E. faecium was demonstrated on CAA when both media were compared for the isolation of the organism from feces. CAA has been shown to possess excellent differential and selective features allowing the simple and effective isolation of E. faecium from heavily contaminated sites.
TI  - Spontaneous peritonitis caused by Streptococcus bovis.
AB  
TI  - Positive inotropic effect of Streptococcus faecalis in isolated cardiac muscle.
AB  - Infective endocarditis is caused by bacterial colonization of the endocardium. Because endocardium modulates mechanical performance of subjacent myocardium, we studied acute effects of bacteria on isolated cardiac muscle and on the functional role of the endocardium. Bacteria, grown in broth at 37 degrees C, were added at increasing concentrations (10(2) to 10(6) bacteria/ml) to cat papillary muscles in Krebs-Ringer solution (1.25 mM Ca2+, 35 degrees C). The endocardial surface was damaged by exposing muscles to a stream of dry air for 30 s. Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis induced significant increases in total peak isometric twitch tension (TT) and maximal velocity of unloaded shortening (Vmax) and significant decreases in time to TT (TtTT) and time to half isometric twitch tension decline (RT 1/2), both before and after removal of endocardial endothelium. This response could also be elicited with bacterial filtrate, after boiling the filtrate or after extracting the polysaccharides from it with KIO4. Increasing Ca2+ concentrations progressively reduced the response to the filtrate. Propranolol slightly, although not significantly, diminished the effects on TT and Vmax while abolishing the effects on TtTT and on RT 1/2. By contrast, Streptococcus bovis and Staphylococcus aureus did not affect TT or Vmax but induced a slight but significant decrease in TtTT at the highest concentration of bacteria. Accordingly, the filtrate of Strep. faecalis induces a positive inotropic effect. The active component is neither a protein nor a polysaccharide, and its effect may be partly beta-adrenoceptor mediated. Strep. bovis and Staph. aureus have negligible acute effects on contractility.
TI  - Immunity in pigeons against homologous and heterologous serotypes of Streptococcus bovis after infection.
AB  - Groups of 20, 20 and 10 pigeons were intravenously inoculated with 1 x 10(9) CFU  of a Streptococcus bovis serotype 1, 2 and 3 strain, respectively. Groups which received the highly virulent serotypes 1 or 2 strains were treated with antibiotics starting from 2 days post inoculation in order to prevent the development of clinical signs. Pigeons inoculated with the low virulence S. bovis serotype 3 strain were left untreated. Another group of 10 non-inoculated pigeons was used as challenge control. Four weeks later, pigeons were challenged intravenously with S. bovis serotype 1. Morbidity after challenge infection was 19%, 36% and 70% in groups previously inoculated with serotypes 1, 2 and 3, respectively, whereas it was 100% in the control group. Results demonstrate that pigeons developed significant protective immunity to S. bovis serotype 1 septicaemia following infection with S. bovis serotype 1 and 2 strains but not after infection with the serotype 3 strain. Protection did not correlate with the presence of antibodies as detected in ELISA.
TI  - [Clinical significance of bacteremia caused by streptococci of the viridans group].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The viridans group Streptococcus (SVG) include species which may have different pathogenic capacity. This study was aimed at evaluating the clinical significance of bacteremia by different species of SVG. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred ninety-four clinical records of patients with blood culture(s) isolation (Hemoline/BioMerieux) of SVG (Api 20 STREP/BioMerieux) over 9 years were reviewed with criteria of clinical significance being established and the results analyzed by the chi square test. RESULTS: The most frequent species of SVG isolated were: S. sanguis II (29.4%), S. mitis (27.3%) and S. anginosus (12.9%). With regard to the criteria established, 36% of the isolates were clinically significant, associating S. anginosus with significant bacteremia (p = 0.001) and S. mitis with non significant bacteremia (p = 0.04). More than half of the isolations of S. anginosus, S. bovis, S. mutans and S. adjacens were clinically significant with this rate being lower in the remaining species (S. sanguis I, S. sanguis II, S. mitis, S. salivarius and S. acidominimus). The significant isolations correspond with endocarditis (S. sanguis II being responsible for 44%; p = 0.05). In 54.3% of the cases followed by abscesses or other localized infections and severe sepsis in patients with a solid or hematologic tumor with a mortality of 20%. The endocarditis/other disease relation was: greater for the existence of endocarditis for S. sanguis II, S. sanguis I, S. mutans, S. bovis and S. adjacens; similar in both diseases for S. mitis, and greater for the existence of a non endocardic disease for S. anginosus. CONCLUSIONS: In this series the isolation of SVG group was clinically significant in 36% of cases with a probability of clinical significance and disease association related to the species isolated of SVG.
TI  - Nutrient transport by ruminal bacteria: a review.
AB  - Fermentation pathways have been elucidated for predominant ruminal bacteria, but  information is limited concerning the specific transport mechanisms used by these microorganisms for C, energy, and N sources. In addition, it is possible that changes in ruminal environmental conditions could affect transport activity. Five carrier-mediated soluble nutrient transport mechanisms have been identified in bacteria: 1) facilitated diffusion, 2) shock sensitive systems, 3) proton symport, 4) Na+ symport, and the 5) phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (PEP-PTS). Several regulatory mechanisms are also involved at the cell membrane to coordinate utilization of different sugars. Recent research has shown that predominant ruminal bacteria are capable of transporting soluble nutrients by several of the mechanisms outlined above. Megasphaera elsdenii, Selenomonas ruminantium, and Streptococcus bovis transport glucose by the PEP-PTS, and S. ruminantium and S. bovis also possess PEP-PTS activity for disaccharides. Glucose PTS activity in S. bovis was highest at a growth pH of 5.0, low glucose concentrations, and a dilution rate of .10 h-1. The cellulolytic ruminal bacterium Fibrobacter succinogenes uses a Na+ symport mechanism for glucose transport that is sensitive to low extracellular pH and ionophores. Sodium also stimulated cellobiose transport by F. succinogenes, and there is evidence for a proton symport in the transport of both arabinose and xylose by S. ruminantium. A chemical gradient of Na+ seems to play an important role in AA transport in several ruminal bacteria. Studying nutrient transport mechanisms in ruminal bacteria will lead to a better understanding of the ruminal fermentation.
TI  - Alternative strategies of 2-deoxyglucose resistance and low affinity glucose transport in the ruminal bacteria, Streptococcus bovis and Selenomonas ruminantium.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis and Selenomonas ruminantium grew in the presence of the glucose analog, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), but the cells no longer had high affinity glucose transport. In S. bovis, 2-DG resistance was correlated with a decrease in phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-dependent glucose phosphotransferase (PTS) activity. The 2-DG-selected S. bovis cells relied solely upon a low affinity, facilitated diffusion mechanism of glucose transport and a 2-DG-resistant glucokinase (ATP-dependent). The glucokinase activity of S. ruminantium was competitively inhibited by 2-DG, and the 2-DG selected cells continued to use PEP-dependent PTS as a mechanism of glucose transport. In this latter case, the 2-DG selected cells switched from a mannosephosphotransferase (enzyme II) that phosphorylated glucose, mannose, and 2-DG, but not alpha-methylglucose to a glucosephosphotransferase (enzyme II) that phosphorylated glucose and alpha-methylglucoside but not 2-DG or mannose. The glucosephosphotransferase (enzyme II) had a very low affinity for glucose and the transport kinetics were similar to the facilitated diffusion system of S. bovis.

AB  - Four anaerobic strains were isolated from the rumen of the cattle which no specific toxic symptoms were seen when Leucaena was fed in Weizhou island Beihai city, Guangxi Province, China. All of these strains (BR-1, BR-2, BR-5 and BR-7) possess degradative activities to toxic mimosine, 3-hydroxy-4 (1H) -pyridone (3, 4-DHP) and 2, 3-dihydroxypyridine (2, 3DHP) from Leucaena, that were confirmed by analysis of HPLC. Pure and mixed cultures of these four strains in vitro degraded 44-59% of mimosine, 30-47% of 3, 4 DHP, and 58-60% of 2, 3 DHP respectively in 3 days. Strains of Both BR-1 and BR-2 were almost identical and were characterized as Lactobacillus, may be a new species. Strains of BR-5 and BR-7 were characterized as Streptococcus bovis and Clostridium sporogenes respectively. It has not yet been reported that these Gram positive facultatively and obligately anaerobic bacteria were able to degrade mimosine, 3, 4 DHP and 2, 3 DHP. These detoxic bacteria were existing in the rumen microflora of cattle in Weizhou island, protecting therefore their hosts animal from Leucaena toxicity.

TI  - Streptococcus bovis infections in pigeons: virulence of different serotypes.
AB  - In a first experiment, the relative virulence for pigeons of 5 strains of S. bovis was assessed by experimental inoculations. Two S. bovis serotype 1 strains, one serotype 2 strain and two serotype 3 strains were examined. One of the serotype 1 strains and the serotype 2 strain were isolated from pigeons that died from septicaemia. The other strains were isolated from cloaca samples of healthy pigeons. For each strain, 10-20 pigeons were intravenously inoculated with 1 x 10(9) CFU. Morbidity after infection with the serotype 1 and 2 strains varied between 75% and 90%. Disease signs included inability to fly, lameness, emaciation, production of slimy, green droppings, polyuria and sudden death. In groups of pigeons inoculated with the serotype 3 strains, morbidity was 0% and 6%, respectively. Results demonstrate that serotype 3 strains are less virulent for pigeons than serotype 1 and 2 strains. In a second experiment, bacteriological and histological examinations were performed on organs of pigeons serially killed between 1 and 10 days after experimental inoculation with an S. bovis serotype 3 strain of low virulence. Results were compared with results of studies carried out with a highly virulent serotype 1 strain. Notwithstanding bacterial spread and replication in various organs of inoculated pigeons, clinical disease was not observed and histological lesions were scarce and of limited extent.

AB  - There is a well-known association between colon carcinoma and bacteraemia with Streptococcus bovis biotype I. There are also associations, less well known, with other streptococci of the viridans group. In three patients, a man of 44, a woman of 53 and one of 52 years old, colorectal carcinomas were diagnosed in association with bacteraemia with S. salivarius, S. milleri, and S. salivarius respectively.
TI  - Prevalence of Streptococcus bovis in racing pigeons.
AB  - The prevalence of S. bovis in the intestinal tract of healthy racing pigeons was  determined. Crop and cloaca swab samples obtained from 810 pigeons from 14 different lofts and from 122 pigeons that were presented for routine health control were examined for the presence of S. bovis. Pooled faecal samples were also obtained from pigeons in 82 different pigeon lofts. S. bovis was isolated from crop or cloaca samples of approximately 40% of pigeons of all ages by direct culture and from 80% of the pooled faecal samples by enrichment culture. In a longitudinal study, crop and cloaca samples were collected every 3 months from pigeons in seven different pigeon lofts. The prevalence of S. bovis in these pigeons ranged from 0 to 100%. The carriage rate was not related to the season or to the age of the pigeons. The prevalence of S. bovis in organ lesions of pigeons examined at necropsy was investigated over a 35-month period. S. bovis was isolated from 10% of the birds examined. The incidence of S. bovis septicaemia was significantly higher in January to August than in September to December. It was concluded that S. bovis is an opportunistic pathogenic agent in pigeons.

TI  - Identification and composition of the streptococcal and enterococcal flora of tonsils, intestines and faeces of pigs.
AB  - Streptococcus suis was the most frequent Streptococcus spp. in pig tonsils, followed by the beta-haemolytic porcine 'equisimilis' ecovar of Strep. dysgalactiae. The intestinal streptococcal flora was composed of Strep. bovis, Strep. hyointestinalis and Strep. suis. Many of these intestinal Strep. suis belonged to a beta-glucuronidase-negative biotype which is infrequent in lesions. Nearly half of the strains presumptively identified as Strep. alactolyticus produced acid from lactose. This species was not found in tonsils and intestines but was about equally prevalent as Strep. hyointestinalis in pig faeces and rectal swabs. Other streptococci were rare in this material. Enterococci were much less frequently identified than streptococci in tonsils and faeces. In intestinal samples Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium, Ent. hirae and Ent. cecorum were most frequently found. In faeces Ent. faecium was the most prevalent enterococcus. The characteristics of the less well known species Strep. alactolyticus and Strep. hyointestinalis are described in detail, and guidelines for their differentiation from Strep. bovis and Strep. suis given.
TI  - [Formate metabolism by lactate-producing and lactate-utilizing rumen bacteria].
AB  - Physiological concentrations [< 11 mM] of formate do not violate the metabolism of S. bovis and M. elsdenii. A significant inhibition is caused by concentrations of 22 and 44 mM. In this case the process of ammonia formation in S. bovis is inhibited more pronouncedly. Peculiar effects of formate (11 mM) on LDH, FDH, aconitase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, fumarase, L-MDH and malic-enzyme have been stated. The changes show that it enhances assimilation of sugars fermented to lactate in S. bovis, in contrast to M. elsdenii, where it activates the utilization of lactic acid. During the log-phase S. bovis utilized only 11.5% of [14C] H2O2, whereas M. elsdenii uses 33.4% of it. The major amount of the label is transferred from intracellular inclusions to nucleic acids (in S. bovis--74.7%, in M. elsdenii--87%) and then incorporated into low molecular substances (23.5 and 11.9%, respectively), the rest being incorporated into proteins and lipids.
TI  - [Regulation of microbiologic processes in the rumen of ruminants by bacteriophages of Streptococcus bovis].
AB  - Influence of bacteriophages of Streptococcus bovis on microbial activity in the rumen was investigated in experiments on cows. Main elements of the mechanism of bacteriophage action on the microflora have been detected. The daily feeding with bacteriophages results in productive infection of sensitive to them rumen bacteria and is associated with increasing bacteriophage concentration in the rumen contents, lower number and activity of amylolytic bacteria, higher cellolytic activity and increased number of bacteria utilizing xylan, cellobiose and xylose. The fermentation is usually shifted to a higher production of propionate and butyrate at the expense of lower acetate. The regulating action of a single bacteriophage feeding on the rumen microflora and its metabolic activity stops on the fifth day. Daily introduction of bacteriophages into the ration of cows under moderate or high levels of feed increases the milk fat by 0.1-0.3%.
TI  - Substrate Preference in a Strain of Megasphaera elsdenii, a Ruminal Bacterium, and Its Implications in Propionate Production and Growth Competition.
AB  - The NIAH 1102 strain of Megasphaera elsdenii utilized lactate in preference to glucose when the two substrates were present. Even when lactate was supplied to cells fermenting glucose, the cells switched substrate utilization from glucose to lactate and did not utilize glucose until lactate decreased to a low concentration (1 to 2 mM). Since substrate utilization was shifted gradually without intermittence, typical diauxic growth was not seen. The cyclic AMP content did not rise markedly with the shift in substrate utilization, suggesting that this nucleotide is not involved in the regulation of the shift. It was unlikely that propionate was produced from glucose, which was explicable by the fact that lactate racemase activity dropped rapidly with the exhaustion of lactate and cells actively fermenting glucose did not possess this enzyme. A coculture experiment indicated that M. elsdenii NIAH 1102 is overcome by Streptococcus bovis JB1 in the competition for glucose, mainly because M. elsdenii NIAH 1102 is obliged to utilize lactate produced by S. bovis JB1; i.e., glucose utilization by M. elsdenii NIAH 1102 is suppressed by the coexistence of S. bovis JB1.
TI  - Binding of radiolabeled monensin and lasalocid to ruminal microorganisms and feed.
AB  - Gram-negative, ionophore-resistant ruminal bacteria and Gram-positive, ionophore-sensitive species bound similar amounts of [14C]lasalocid, but neither group bound large amounts of [14C]monensin. Membrane vesicles also bound more lasalocid than monensin (P < .05). The binding was first-order at low cell or vesicle concentrations and saturable at high cell or vesicle densities. Streptococcus bovis was inhibited by both monensin and lasalocid (5 microM), but cells that were re-incubated in medium lacking ionophore grew rapidly. Lasalocid-treated cells grew very slowly when they were resuspended in fresh medium. Based on these results, it seemed that lasalocid had a higher affinity for bacterial membranes than monensin. Mixed bacteria, however, bound nearly equal amounts of [14C]monensin and [14C]lasalocid (P > .05). Monensin binding was greatly reduced when the mixed ruminal bacteria were pretreated with Tris+EDTA (P < .05), but Tris+EDTA did not affect the binding of lasalocid. Mixed ruminal protozoa always took up more lasalocid than monensin (P < .05), but feed particles bound equal amounts of [14C]lasalocid and [14C]monensin (P > .05). Based on the binding capacity of mixed ruminal bacteria, ruminal protozoa, and feed particles, there would be little free ionophore in ruminal fluid.
TI  - Energy-spilling reactions of Streptococcus bovis and resistance of its membrane to proton conductance.
AB  - Glucose-excess cultures of Streptococcus bovis consumed glucose faster than the amount that could be explained by growth or maintenance, and nongrowing chloramphenicol-treated cells had a rate of glucose consumption that was 10-fold greater than the maintenance rate. Because N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, an inhibitor of the membrane-bound F1F0 ATPase, eliminated the nongrowth energy dissipation (energy spilling) without a decrease in ATP and the rate of energy spilling could be increased by the protonophore 3,3',4',5-tetrachlorosalicylanilide, it appeared that a futile cycle of protons through the cell membrane was responsible for most of the energy spilling. When the rate of energy spilling was decreased gradually with iodoacetate, there was only a small decrease in the phosphorylation potential (delta G'p) and the theoretical estimate of H+ per ATP decreased from 4.2 to 3.6. On the bases of this ratio of H+ to ATP and the rate of ATP production, the flux of protons (amperage) across the cell membrane was directly proportional to the rate of energy spilling. Amperage values estimated from delta G'p were, however, nearly twice as great as values which were estimated from the heat production (delta H) of the cells [amperage = (0.38 x wattage)/delta p]. The last comparison indicated that only a fraction of the delta G of ATP hydrolysis was harvested by the F1F0 ATPase to pump protons. Both estimates of amperage indicated that the resistance of the cell membrane to proton conductance was inversely proportional to the log of the energy-spilling rate.
TI  - Influence of Yucca shidigera extract on ruminal ammonia concentrations and ruminal microorganisms.
AB  - An extract of the desert plant Yucca shidigera was assessed for its possible benefit in ruminal fermentation. The extract bound ammonia in aqueous solution when concentrations of ammonia were low (up to 0.4 mM) and when the extract was added at a high concentration to the sample (20%, vol/vol). The apparent ammonia-binding capability was retained after autoclaving and was decreased slightly following dialysis. Acid-precipitated extract was inactive. No evidence of substantial ammonia binding was found at higher ammonia concentrations (up to 30 mM). When Y. shidigera extract (1%, vol/vol) was added to strained rumen fluid in vitro, a small (6%) but significant (P < 0.05) decrease in ammonia concentration occurred, apparently because of decreased proteolysis. Inclusion of Y. shidigera extract (1%, vol/vol) in the growth medium of the rumen bacterium Streptococcus bovis ES1 extended its lag phase, while growth of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens SH13 was abolished. The growth of Prevotella (Bacteroides) ruminicola B(1)4 was stimulated, and that of Selenomonas ruminantium Z108 was unaffected. Protozoal activity, as measured by the breakdown of 14C-leucine-labelled S. ruminantium in rumen fluid incubated in vitro, was abolished by the addition of 1% extract. The antimicrobial activities were unaffected by precipitating tannins with polyvinylpyrrolidone, but a butanol extract, containing the saponin fraction, retained its antibacterial and antiprotozoal effects. Saponins from other sources were less effective against protozoa than Y. shidigera saponins. Y. shidigera extract, therefore, appears unlikely to influence ammonia concentration in the rumen directly, but its saponins have antimicrobial properties, particularly in suppressing ciliate protozoa, which may prove beneficial to ruminal fermentation and may lead indirectly to lower ruminal ammonia concentrations.
TI  - Penetration of ceftriaxone into the intervertebral disc.
AB  - Concentrations of ceftriaxone in serum and intervertebral disc tissue were determined with high-pressure liquid chromatography in forty-five patients after a single intravenous loading dose of 1000 milligrams given at different intervals before an operation on the spine. The mean serum concentrations in this study corresponded well with reported values. The mean tissue concentrations were 5.6 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 3.6 to 6.8 micrograms per gram) one to less than two hours after administration of the antibiotic, 6.4 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 2.8 to 10.0 micrograms per gram) two to less than four hours, and 3.6 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 0.6 to 6.6 micrograms per gram) at fourteen to less than sixteen hours. These drug concentrations exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration that was effective against 90 per cent of the bacteria for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus; for Streptococcus pyogenes, agalactiae, viridans, pneumoniae, and bovis; and for community-acquired Enterobacteriaceae. The average serum-to-tissue ratio was 191:1 at less than one-half hour and 13:1 at less than one and a half hours. The lower values of the 95 per cent confidence intervals for the concentration of the antibiotic exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentrations in the disc tissue against most susceptible bacteria during the period between one and a half and four hours, but a larger bolus would be needed to maintain this level for a longer period (such as in a longer operation) and as prophylaxis against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci.

Tannins bound to cell coat polymers in all strains. Morphological changes in B. fibrisolvens and S. bovis implicated the cell wall as a target of tannin toxicity.

There were no predisposing factors such as i.v. drug abuse or congenital heart disease. The clinical course was complicated with an epidose of pulmonary emboli occurring after the onset of treatment. The patient responded to the appropriate antibiotics without requiring valve surgery. The association of Streptococcus bovis endocarditis and bacteremia with colonic neoplasia has been reported in the literature. In this case the evaluation of the colon was negative.

TI  - Regulation of two aspartokinase isozymes in Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis has been found to contain two distinct aspartokinases that can be separated by gel filtration chromatography. One of these isozymes elutes on Sephadex G-200 gel filtration at a molecular weight greater than 250,000. The molecular weight of the other isozyme is approximately 125,000. The earlier peak of aspartokinase activity is slightly inhibited by meso-diaminopimelate, while the second peak is sensitive to inhibition by lysine. The latter aspartokinase is not formed when the organism is grown in a medium containing more than 1 mM lysine. The level of lysine-sensitive aspartokinase is decreased during the growth cycle, whereas diaminopimelate-sensitive activity is little affected by the growth conditions. The regulatory properties of the two aspartokinases suggest that they may play different physiological roles.
TI  - Endocarditis with pericardial bioprostheses: clinico-pathologic characteristics,  immediate and long term prognosis.
AB  - Between 1977 and 1992, 30 consecutive episodes of infective endocarditis in 28 patients involving pericardial bioprostheses were diagnosed and treated in our hospital. Eleven (37%) were early pericardial valve endocarditis occurring in the first 60 days following valve surgery, and 19 (63%) were late endocarditis. In both the early and late groups, more aortic that mitral valves were affected (19/30). The most frequent pathogen in the early cases was staphylococcus, (S. epidermidis in five cases, S. aureus in one). The most frequent pathogen among late cases was streptococcus: (St. viridans in four, St. faecalis in two, St. bovis in one). In four cases (13%) no pathogen was isolated. Twelve patients received antibiotic treatment alone, six specific for the pathogen and other six only arbitrarily chosen regimen. All patients were cured in the former and all patients died in the latter group (four with negative blood cultures and two in whom identification of the pathogen was delayed-Proteus mirabillis in one case and Brucella mellitensis in the other). Valve replacement during the infective endocarditis episode was necessary in 18 cases, either because of failure of the antibiotic treatment or because of heart failure secondary to prosthetic malfunction. Peri-annular abscess was present in five cases. Surgical mortality was 22.2% (4/18). In all, 11 patients (39%) died during the active stage of infective endocarditis. The most frequent cause of death was heart failure (45.5%). All four patients with negative blood cultures died. The most advisable strategy for treating bacterial endocarditis of pericardial bioprostheses is a combination of antibiotic therapy and early surgery, especially in cases of staphylococcus endocarditis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Streptococcus bovis bacteremia and meningitis associated with Strongyloides stercoralis colitis in a patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus.
AB  - We present a case of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection complicated by  Streptococcus bovis meningitis and bacteremia and severe Strongyloides stercoralis colitis. The association between S. bovis infection and strongyloidiasis has not been described previously. This case highlights the importance of searching for larvae of S. stercoralis as part of the evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract of patients with bacteremia or meningitis due to certain enteric organisms. The role of HIV infection in the development of severe S. stercoralis colitis in association with S. bovis bacteremia and meningitis is unclear.
TI  - An unusual outbreak of Streptococcus bovis septicaemia in racing pigeons (Columba livia).
AB  - In December 1991, an outbreak of Streptococcus bovis septicaemia occurred in a Belgian pigeon loft where 25 male and 25 female racing pigeons were housed. The main clinical signs included inability to fly and poor breeding results. None of the female pigeons and only one male pigeon was able to fly. Nine affected pigeons were necropsied. Histologically a tenosynovitis of the tendon of the deep pectoral muscle was observed in most of them and S bovis was isolated from the canalis triosseus or the shoulder joints of five of the nine pigeons. The pigeons were successfully treated with ampicillin administered in the drinking water for seven days.
TI  - Conjugative transfer of tetracycline resistance in rumen streptococcal strains.
AB  - In 11% of tested Streptococcus bovis strains a conjugative transfer of tetracycline resistance was observed when mating experiments were carried out on membrane filters. The recipient strain used was S. bovis BM114 with chromosomal resistance to rifampicin. In addition, in two strains tetracycline resistance was transferred also to recipient strain Enterococcus faecium AL6. The transfer frequencies were in the range of 10(-6) to 10(-3). The donor strains were screened for the presence of plasmids and one up to four bands of plasmid DNA in all tested strains were revealed. In spite of that isolation of plasmid DNA was successful only in 53/4/114 transconjugants. Transconjugant 32/114 contained amylase activity which was higher than in the donor strain.
TI  - [Analysis of key enzyme activities involved in aspartate amino acid biosynthesis  in Streptococcus bovis].
AB  - The first and the third steps in the aspartate biosynthesis pathway in Streptococcus bovis are catalyzed by two different forms of aspartokinase and a single homoserine dehydrogenase, respectively. These enzymes can be separated by ammonium sulfate fractionation and gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. The two aspartokinase isozymes differ in molecular weights and are subject to differential regulation. The aspartokinase system of S. bovis is characterized by the absence of specific negative allosteric effectors among the end products of the synthesis of amino acids of the aspartic family. Homoserine dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the third step of the aspartic family amino acid synthesis, also has such negative effectors as threonine and methionine. The aspartokinase isozymes do not form multienzyme complexes with homoserine hydrogenase in S. bovis.
TI  - [Rumen bacterial metabolism as affected by extracellular redox potential].
AB  - The redox potential (Eh) in the digestive tract of ruminants varies mostly within the ranges from -300 to +200 mV, in the rumen medium: from -130 to -200 mV. Eh and pH changes are of a linear character. Enhanced fermentation moves Eh towards negative values and improves growth of microorganisms. Eh values become even more negative as affected by Na2S, NaOH, cysteine and NaHSO3. Addition of picrate, sodium nitrate, hydrochloric acid, copper sulphate, gaseous oxygen and particularly heavy metals (silver and mercury) promotes positive Eh values and inhibits metabolism. Optimum Eh values for Megasphaera elsdenii are more negative, than those for Streptococcus bovis. In the process of S. bovis growth, the production of lactate, VFA, CH2O2 and NH3 increases, Eh and pH values decrease. More positive Eh values inhibit metabolism and growth rates of Selenomonas ruminantium, Bacteroides amylophilus, Bacteroides succinogenes and Streptococcus bovis to different degrees.
TI  - Protective immunity elicited by rBCG vaccines.
AB  - The live attenuated Mycobacterium bovis strain Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is still widely used as a vaccine against tuberculosis and therefore offers potential advantages as a safe, live vaccine vehicle for the expression and delivery of protective recombinant antigens. As an attenuated intracellular bacterium residing in macrophages, BCG would seem to be particularly suited for eliciting cellular responses and not humoral responses. Efforts to improve the potential for recombinant BCG (rBCG) vaccines to elicit protective humoral responses were undertaken by developing vectors systems which export or secrete foreign antigens. Expression of the OspA antigen of Borrelia burgdorferi, as a chimaeric membrane-associated lipoprotein, resulted in high-titred protective humoral responses when compared to cytoplasmic or secreted expression of OspA. Expression of the PspA antigen of Streptococcus pneumoniae as a secreted or membrane-associated lipoprotein by rBCG did not result in higher-titred humoral responses in comparison to PspA expressed cytoplasmically but apparently improved the quality of protective PspA specific antibodies. Based on these pre-clinical studies, rBCG vaccines for Lyme and pneumococcal diseases are being developed for clinical trials in humans. The potential for eliciting mucosal responses to antigens delivered by rBCG was also investigated. Nasal immunization was superior at eliciting substantial lasting mucosal responses at multiple mucosal sites and also resulted in systemic responses comparable to those obtained with parenteral immunization.
TI  - The adherence of three Streptococcus bovis strains to cells of rumen epithelium primoculture under various conditions.
AB  - Three Streptococcus bovis strains were tested in biotype assay and examined for the adherence to cells of rumen epithelium primoculture. The adherence pattern of ruminal streptococci in phosphate buffered saline at pH values ranging from 4.1 to 8.5 was determined. Our isolates of Streptococcus bovis strains adhered best at pH 7.0-7.3. To characterize the adhesive determinants, the bacterial cells were exposed to various treatments. Protease treatment dramatically decreased the adherence of all Streptococcus bovis strains, thus suggesting that the determinants responsible for the adherence are largely proteinaceous. Carbohydrates could be also significantly involved in the active sites of bacterial surface because metaperiodate-treated cells adhered much more poorly than control, sodium iodate-treated cells. Addition of carbohydrates (lactose, maltose and saccharose) had no significant effect on the adherence of Streptococcus bovis strains although a slight decrease in the adhesion was detected.
TI  - Effect of extracellular lactate on growth of rumen lactate producers.
AB  - The addition of Na-lactate (50-150 mmol/l) to media with glucose had only marginal effect on the growth of rumen lactate-producing bacteria at pH between 6.5 and 5.8. Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens was somewhat more sensitive to external lactate than Streptococcus bovis, Lactobacillus fermentum and Selenomonas ruminantium. It can be concluded that rumen lactate producers, which proliferate at the onset of rumen lactic acidosis, are not influenced by the lactate accumulation, except some non-specific osmotic effects.

An additional case is her by reported.
TI  - LlaAI and LlaBI, two type-II restriction endonucleases from Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris W9 and W56 recognizing, respectively, 5'-/GATC-3' and 5'-C/TRYAG-3'.
AB  - Two type-II restriction endonucleases have been purified from Lactococcus lactis  subsp. cremoris W9 and W56, the strains isolated from a mixed Cheddar starter. Their characterization showed that LlaAI was an isoschizomer of MboI from Morexella bovis with the cleaving sequence, 5'/GATC-3', being sensitive to methylation of the adenine residue; LlaBI was an isoschizomer to SfcI from Streptococcus faceium with the cleaving sequence, 5'-C/TRYAG-3'. Both LlaAI and LlaBI restriction-modification (R-M) systems are encoded by the plasmids, respectively, pFW094 and pJW563, protecting the harboring strain against phage attack.
TI  - Serological investigation into the association between Streptococcus bovis and colonic cancer.
AB  - AIMS: To determine if there was an increase in antibody titre to Streptococcus bovis in patients with colonic cancer, and if this might be a useful marker of the presence for colonic cancer. METHODS: Serum samples from 16 patients and 16 age matched controls were tested by immunoblot and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against antigen preparations from two strains of S bovis and one strain of Enterococcus faecalis. RESULTS: No distinction between cancer patients and controls could be made using immunoblots. ELISA did show an increase in antibodies to S bovis, but there was a greater increase in antibodies to E faecalis. The increase in antibody titres was greatest with antigens which had been treated with periodate, and was therefore thought not to be caused by antibody to the shared group D carbohydrate antigen. CONCLUSION: It may be possible to construct a test for the detection of colonic cancer based on the detection of antibody to S bovis or E faecalis, though considerable further development of this concept is required.
TI  - [Bacterial endocarditis: current bacteriological data].
AB  - The bacteria causing infective endocarditis have not changed significantly despite the diversity of potential portals of entry. Streptococci (viridans) cause 35 to 45% of cases of endocarditis. Group D streptococci of gastrointestinal origin cause about 20% of cases of endocarditis: Streptococcus bovis is the most commonly isolated species followed by the enterococcus. The beta-haemolytic streptococci of Groups A, B, C and G are rarely isolated. Seventeen to thirty per cent of endocarditis is caused by staphylococci, above all Staphylococcus aureus. These infections are mainly observed in patients with prosthetic valves or intravenous catheters and in intravenous drug addicts. With respect to gram-negative bacilli, enterobacteria are rarely responsible for endocarditis and those of the HACEK group (Haemophilus, Actinobacillus, Cardiobacterium, etc.) were isolated in 3% of cases. Q fever and Chlamydia endocarditis are rare, as are fungal infections usually due to Candida. Endocarditis with negative blood cultures is still observed in about 10% of cases.
TI  - SbvI restriction endonuclease from Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - Restriction endonuclease SbvI, an isoschizomer of HaeIII, has been isolated from  rumen amylolytic bacterium Streptococcus bovis II/1. SbvI was purified from cell extract by phosphocellulose chromatography and heparin-Sepharose chromatography. The recognition sequence of SbvI was identified by digestion of pBR322, pUC9 and lambda-DNA and comparing the cleavage patterns obtained with computer-derived data. SbvI recognizes the 4-bp palindrome, 5'-GGCC-3' and cleaves DNA after the second G in the sequence, producing blunt ends.
TI  - [Pulmonary valve endocarditis, bilateral deep vein thrombosis amd recurrent pulmonary emboli].
AB  - A 57-year-old obese man with hypertensive heart disease and long-standing varicose veins developed recurrent bouts of fever, lung infiltrations, cardiac arrhythmias and increasing dyspnoea. On admission multiple lung emboli and bilateral deep vein thromboses were confirmed. The echocardiogram demonstrated floating vegetations on all three pulmonary valve cusps. Biochemical tests indicated an inflammatory constellation (ESR 62/105 mm, C-reactive protein 13.3 mg/dl), partial respiratory insufficiency (pO2 54.6 mm Hg; pCO2 29 mm Hg). Streptococcus bovis was grown from several blood cultures. Conservative treatment over several weeks, complicated by "drug fever", with penicillin G (10 mega IU four times daily) and gentamicin (80 mg twice daily intravenously), later vancomycin (500 mg four times daily intravenously), then roxithromycin (150 mg three times daily by mouth), as well as maintenance anticoagulation with heparin (800-1,200 IU/h intravenously, later 15,000 IU subcutaneously twice daily), followed by phenprocoumon, contained the disease. One year after onset of treatment a good functional results had been achieved.
TI  - Molecular cloning and expression of two alpha-amylase genes from Streptococcus bovis 148 in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The alpha-amylase genes of Streptococcus bovis 148 were cloned in Escherichia coli MC1061, using pBR322. The recombinant plasmids were classified into two groups on the basis of their restriction maps. Southern blot analysis did not show homology between the two types of alpha-amylase genes, and the two alpha-amylase genes existed on the chromosomal DNA of S. bovis 148. The enzymatic properties and N-terminal amino acid sequences of the two purified enzymes produced by the cloned E. coli strains were quite different from each other. Particularly, one alpha-amylase (Amy I) was adsorbed on raw corn starch and hydrolyzed raw corn starch, and another (Amy II) was not adsorbed on raw corn starch and did not hydrolyze raw corn starch. Amy I was considered to be the same as the extracellular alpha-amylase of S. bovis 148 in raw starch absorbability, ability to hydrolyze raw corn starch, enzymatic characteristics, N-terminal amino acid sequence, and mode of action on soluble starch. Amy II showed a unique pattern of oligosaccharide production from soluble starch compared with the extracellular alpha-amylase of S. bovis 148. Amy II was suggested to be an intracellular alpha-amylase of S. bovis 148.
TI  - Contagious mastitis.
AB  - Contagious mastitis is defined. The major mastitis pathogens are Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium bovis, Mycoplasma sp, and Streptococcus dysgalactiae. These pathogens are discussed relative to prevalence, virulence factors, pathology, and control. These control measures include milking time hygiene, segregation, culling, vaccination, and treatment.
TI  - Development of infection with Streptococcus bovis and Aspergillus sp. in irradiated mice after glycopeptide therapy.
AB  - The use of ofloxacin and glycopeptides was evaluated for the treatment of infections arising in C3H/HeN female mice irradiated with 8.3 Gy from a 60Co source. The 21 day regimen began 72 h after irradiation when each of five sets of experimental animals received three antimicrobial therapy regimens and a saline-treated control group. With 40 mice in each group, 20 were used to monitor survival, 20 for the recovery of bacteria from the liver culture. Treatment groups were oral ofloxacin 20 mg/kg/day; oral or intramuscular vancomycin 50 mg/kg/day; oral teicoplanin 50 mg/kg/day; ofloxacin and vancomycin; ofloxacin and teicoplanin; or saline. Bacteria recovered from saline treated mice were Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcus spp. By comparison, fewer Enterobacteriaceae were isolated from ofloxacin treated mice and fewer Streptococcus spp. in both vancomycin and teicoplanin treated mice. However, glycopeptide-treated mice developed infection with Aspergillus fumigatus and glycopeptide resistant Streptococcus bovis. Mortality rates within 60 days of irradiation were 100% in all treatment and control groups with the exception of ofloxacin which was 25%-35%. These data suggest that glycopeptide therapy increases rates of systemic infection with fungi and antibiotic resistant bacteria in irradiated mice.
TI  - Recurrent infective endocarditis.
AB  - Infective endocarditis is a serious disease associated with high mortality. Patients surviving recurrent bouts of infective endocarditis are reported infrequently. We report on a non-drug abuser patient who experienced seven episodes of infective endocarditis--the largest number reported to our knowledge in a single non-drug abuser patient.
TI  - Antibiotic treatment of Streptococcus bovis infections in pigeons.
AB  - The antibiotic susceptibility pattern of 5. bovis strains isolated from pigeons was studied. In vitro, S. bovis strains were sensitive to penicillins, macrolides, lincomycin, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol and nitrofurans. However, the prevalence of acquired resistance against tetracyclines was approximately 40%. Sulphonamides and trimethoprim had little in vitro activity against 5. bovis while activity of the quinolone enrofloxacin and the aminoglycoside antibiotics, neomycin and gentamicin, were in or near to the intermediate range. The comparative efficacy of 5 antimicrobials administered via the drinking water for the treatment of experimental S. bovis infection in pigeons was also tested. Morbidity after intravenous inoculation of S. bovis in groups of pigeons treated with ampicillin, erythromycin, doxycycline, enrofloxacin and trimethoprim was 20%, 30%, 20%, 70% and 90%, respectively. Morbidity in an untreated control group was 90%.
TI  - Acetohydroxy acid synthase and threonine deaminase activities, and the biosynthesis of isoleucine-leucine-valine in Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - Acetohydroxy acid synthase (AHAS) and threonine deaminase (TD) activities were found in Streptococcus bovis and shown to be involved in the biosynthesis of the branched chain amino acids isoleucine, leucine and valine. Apparent lack of repression of AHAS synthesis by the end-products and reduced sensitivity of S. bovis growth to analogues of the branched chain amino acids suggested that secretion of isoleucine, leucine and valine in the growth medium may be a consequence of the regulatory features of AHAS. A glycyl-leucine-resistant mutant with reduced TD activity secreted a reduced amount of isoleucine and an increased amount of valine, which might be a result of the reduced rate of synthesis of the isoleucine precursor alpha-ketobutyrate and of a consequent preferential carbon flow through the valine branch of the pathway.
TI  - [Regulation of enzymes of the first and last stage of lysine biosynthesis in Streptococcus bovis and Enterococcus faecium].
AB  - Regulation of aspartate kinase and diaminopimelate decarboxylase activities in Streptococcus bovis and Enterococcus faecium cell-free extracts was studied. The levels of synthesis of aspartate kinase and diaminopimelate decarboxylase in both microorganisms are growth-dependent. The synthesis of these enzymes is depressed by lysine, but the activity of aspartate kinase is induced by addition of this amino acid and threonine to the reaction system. Meso-diaminopimelate dehydrogenase activity was not found in the extracts of Streptococcus bovis and Enterococcus faecium. The data excludes the possibility of lysine formation via six enzyme reactions.
TI  - Prevalence of antibodies to Streptococcus bovis serotype 1 in racing pigeons.
AB  - Indirect ELISA techniques for the detection of antibodies to S. bovis serotypes 1, 2 and 3 in pigeon plasma were developed. Whole formaldehyde-inactivated bacteria were used as coating antigens. Bound antibodies were detected with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-pigeon serum and OPD and H2O2 as chromogen and substrate, respectively. ELISA was used to determine the prevalence of antibodies to S. bovis serotype 1 in healthy Belgian racing pigeons. Antibodies were demonstrated in 83 (= 37%) of 225 samples tested. Results indicate that pigeons may build up plasma antibodies in the absence of clinical signs resembling septicaemia.
TI  - The inhibition by ionophores in vitro of an Enterococcus-like pathogen of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss.
AB  - Streptococcosis is a major disease of several fish species in Australia, Japan and South Africa. The minimum inhibitory concentration of some ionophores (lasalocid, monensin, narasin and salinomycin) was determined in vitro for an Enterococcus-like species pathogenic for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in Australia. Forty isolates of the fish pathogen were tested, together with control strains of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Streptococcus bovis ATCC 9809. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of erythromycin, the drug of choice for controlling streptococcosis, ranged between 0.1 and 0.8 microgram/ml whereas the MIC values for the ionophores ranged between 0.2 and 1.5 micrograms/ml. Of the ionophores tested, narasin was the most inhibitory (0.2-0.4 microgram/ml), while monensin was the least inhibitory (0.4-1.5 micrograms/ml). Salinomycin was marginally more inhibitory (0.4-0.8 microgram/ml) than lasalocid (0.8 microgram/ml).
TI  - A case of infective endocarditis in a farmer caused by Streptococcus equinus.
AB  - The following is a case report of a farmer with documented aortic valve disease who developed bacterial endocarditis secondary to Streptococcus equinus. This is a rare pathogen in man and its acquisition in this case may be related to the subject's occupation.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis meningitis: no association with colonic malignancy.
AB  
TI  - Development of a DNA probe for Streptococcus bovis by using a cloned amylase gene.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis is a normal inhabitant of the rumen but has been implicated as a causative agent for ruminal lactic acidosis and related problems. While rarely isolated from humans, S. bovis has been identified as a causative agent for endocarditis, meningitis, and septicemia. Recent reports have also suggested a correlation between human colonic carcinoma and increased levels of S. bovis. Identification of S. bovis strains of human origin has been problematic because of variations in results of biochemical tests compared with results for ruminal strains. We have tested a cloned amylase gene from the ruminal strain S. bovis JB1 as a potential DNA probe for rapid and accurate identification of S. bovis strains from all sources. DNAs from strains identified as S. bovis, of both human and ruminal origin, were found to hybridize with the probe under stringent conditions. The probe also hybridized with variants of S. bovis that did not grow on starch. The probe did not hybridize with DNA isolated from other bacteria of human colonic and ruminal origin, including Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ruminicola, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and Enterococcus faecalis but did demonstrate hybridization with Streptococcus salivarius.
TI  - The glutamine cyclotransferase reaction of Streptococcus bovis: a novel mechanism of deriving energy from non-oxidative and non-reductive deamination.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis deaminated glutamine by a mechanism that did not involve glutaminase. Since pyroglutamate and ammonia were the only end-products, it appeared that glutamine deamination was catalyzed by a cyclotransferase reaction. Stationary S. bovis cells had essentially no intracellular ATP or membrane potential (delta psi), however, when they were provided with glutamine, intracellular ATP and delta psi increased to 0.52 mM and 158 mV, respectively. When glutamine-energized cells were treated with N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD, 150 microM), there was an even greater increase in intracellular ATP (> 5-fold) and the delta psi was dissipated. Because toluene-treated cells produced ATP from ADP and Pi, it did not appear that the cell membrane was directly involved in glutamine-dependent ATP generation. The rate of ammonia production was directly proportional to the glutamine concentration, but the stoichiometry of ATP to ammonia was always 1 to 1. Based on these results, it appeared that glutamine was deaminated by glutamine cyclotransferase which was coupled to ATP formation. The membrane bound ATPase then used the ATP to create a delta psi.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis does not selectively colonize colorectal cancer and polyps.
AB  - The objective was to determine if Streptococcus bovis selectively colonizes colorectal cancer and polyps. Stools were submitted before colonoscopy; fluid and selected tissue biopsies obtained during colonoscopy were cultured for S. bovis. The setting was a large multispecialty clinic. Outpatients undergoing colonoscopy for suspected colorectal cancer and polyps were the participants. Forty studies on 35 patients were performed. One of 35 stools (2.9%) obtained before colonoscopy yielded S. bovis. S. bovis was cultured from three of 40 fluid aspirations (7.5%), one of 33 adenomas biopsied (3%), none of six adenocarcinomas, none of 14 nonneoplastic polyps, one of 40 (2.5%) biopsies from normal mucosa adjacent to an adenoma, and none of 40 mucosal biopsies remote from any lesion. These data do not support selective colonization of colorectal neoplasms by S. bovis.
TI  - Characterization of bacteriocins from Enterococcus faecium with activity against  Listeria monocytogenes.
AB  - Laboratory cultures and environmental isolates of bacteria were screened for antagonism towards Listeria monocytogenes using an agar spot test. Seven of the 163 strains that were tested, one Streptococcus bovis, one Enterococcus casseliflavus, two E. avium and three E. faecium, consistently displayed antilisterial activity. Cell-free, pH-neutralized supernatants prepared from the three E. faecium strains (JBL1061, JBL1083 and JBL1351) exhibited strong antilisterial activity against L. monocytogenes, and were subjected to more detailed analyses. The antagonistic factors produced by these three strains were sensitive to chloroform and several proteolytic enzymes, resistant to heat (121 degrees C, 20 min), and stable over a wide pH range (3.0-10.0). Moreover, they were listericidal without causing cell lysis. These data suggest that a bacteriocin(s) is involved in the inhibition of L. monocytogenes by E. faecium JBL1061, JBL1083 and JBL1351.
TI  - Adherence of glucan-positive and glucan-negative strains of Streptococcus bovis to human epithelial cells.
AB  - Adherence to buccal epithelial cells (BEC) and the role played in the binding by  lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and other superficial components have been studied in reference and clinical strains of Streptococcus bovis either glucan-positive biotype I or glucan-negative biotype II. To avoid the synthesis of glucan by biotype I strains, adherence was studied in bacteria grown in Todd-Hewitt broth, a sucrose deficient medium. Both biotypes were shown to bind to BEC and clinical isolates, irrespective of biotype attached to the same degree but in greater numbers than reference strains. Inhibition studies suggest that at least two mechanisms,--LTA and protein-mediated--are responsible for the adherence of both glucan-positive and negative strains of S. bovis. Moreover, in glucan-positive strains capsular polysaccharides may be also involved.
TI  - Effect of amino acids on the heat production and growth efficiency of Streptococcus bovis: balance of anabolic and catabolic rates.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis JB1 grew nearly twice as fast (0.9 versus 1.6 h-1) and had a  40% greater growth yield (18 versus 12.5 mg of protein per mmol of glucose) when an ammonia-based medium was supplemented with amino acids, but the glucose consumption rate (88 mumol mg of protein-1 h-1) and specific rate of heat production (2.1 mW/mg of protein) were unaffected. Amino acid availability had little effect on the catabolic rate, but the specific heat decreased 40% (8.8 to 5.2 J/mg of protein). These growth rate-dependent changes in metabolic efficiency were fivefold greater than the maintenance energy. Chloramphenicol (100 mg/l), an inhibitor of protein synthesis, caused a gradual decrease in anabolic (growth) rate, but there was little change in the rate of glucose consumption and the specific heat increased. When growth was inhibited by iodoacetate, the catabolic and anabolic rates both declined and there was not increase in specific heat. On the basis of these results, the benefit of amino acid supplementation was largely explained by the balance of anabolic and catabolic rates. When amino acids were available, the anabolic and catabolic rates were more closely matched and less energy was spilled as heat.
TI  - Use of modified Rambach agar to differentiate Streptococcus uberis from other mastitis streptococci.
AB  - The medium of Rambach was modified to permit differentiation of mastitis streptococci. A total of 377 streptococci isolated from bovine IMI was used in the study. Of the 159 strains identified as Streptococcus uberis, 151 strains (94.9%) were beta-galactosidase-positive and yielded blue colonies on modified Rambach agar. In comparison, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Enterococcus saccharolyticus, or Enterococcus faecalis strains were negative for propylene glycol utilization (red colonies) or beta-galactosidase production; all strains yielded colorless colonies on modified Rambach agar. However, 5 of 35 (14.3%) Streptococcus equinus strains were also positive for beta-galactosidase. Results indicate that modified Rambach agar is a convenient medium for the differentiation of the Strep. uberis from the other mastitis streptococci. Furthermore, modified Rambach agar could be easily incorporated as a screening medium for Strep. uberis in mastitis bacteriology laboratories.
TI  - Purification and characterization of the extracellular alpha-amylase from Streptococcus bovis JB1.
AB  - The extracellular alpha-amylase (1,4-alpha-D-glucanglucanohydrolase; EC 3.2.1.1)  from maltose-grown Streptococcus bovis JB1 was purified to apparent homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography (Mono Q). The enzyme had an isoelectric point of 4.50 and an apparent molecular mass of 77,000 Da, as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme was rich in acidic and hydrophobic amino acids. The 15-amino-acid NH2-terminal sequence was 40% homologous with the Bacillus subtilis saccharifying alpha-amylase and 27% homologous with the Clostridium acetobutylicum alpha-amylase. alpha-Amylase activity on soluble starch was optimal at pH 5.0 to 6.0. The enzyme was relatively stable between pH 5.5 and 8.5 and at temperatures below 50 degrees C. When soluble potato starch was used as the substrate, the enzyme had a Km of 0.88 mg.ml-1 and a kcat of 2,510 mumol of reducing sugar.min-1.mg of protein-1. The enzyme exhibited neither pullulanase nor dextranase activity and was 40 to 70% as active on amylopectin as on amylose. The major end products of amylose hydrolysis were maltose, maltotriose, and maltotetraose.
TI  - The efficacy of teicoplanin in the treatment of endocarditis caused by gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-six patients with endocarditis caused by Streptococcus viridans (n = 12),  Enterococcus faecalis (n = 5), Streptococcus bovis (n = 2), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 4) were treated with teicoplanin at a dose of 600 mg/day in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance 80-120 mL/min) and at a dose of 400 mg/day in patients with moderately impaired renal function (creatinine clearance < 75 mL/min). In nine patients valve replacements were performed. Twenty-one patients were cured by medical treatment with teicoplanin, five patients had a surgical intervention during treatment which was subsequently stopped. Overall, eighteen patients with native valve endocarditis were cured. Out of eight patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis six patients were cured. In one patient teicoplanin therapy was withdrawn because of clinical failure. One patient had a clinical relapse. All cultures taken from blood, endocardium and excised artificial valves were sterile after a minimum of seven days therapy. Side effects were seen in seven patients and included a moderate increase in liver enzymes and mild leucopenia. No renal toxicity was observed, trough serum levels of teicoplanin were not correlated with renal function, a slight accumulation of teicoplanin on day 28 being seen. Our study confirms that teicoplanin is effective as single agent therapy in the treatment of endocarditis due to Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefpirome, a new fourth-generation cephalosporin in comparison with other agents.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefpirome was compared with amoxycillin/clavulanic  acid, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin and amikacin against 743 non-duplicate clinical isolates. MIC50 and MIC90 showed that the antibiotic was active against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms. Cefpirome was highly active against most of the Enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive Proteus spp., Aeromonas spp. (MIC < or = 1 mg/L) and Salmonella spp. (MIC < or = 0.5 mg/L). Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producers) were all susceptible, with MIC less than 0.5 and 0.25 mg/L respectively. Cefpirome was more active than cefuroxime and ceftazidime against Campylobacter spp. (MIC < or = 2 mg/L), but less active than ceftazidime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefpirome was active against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Streptococcus bovis and coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC < or = 0.5 mg/L) and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MIC < or = 2 mg/L). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobes were resistant to cefpirome. The stability of cefpirome to TEM-1, TEM-2, PSE-1, SHV-1 and the chromosomal-mediated P99 and K-1 beta-lactamases was comparable to ceftazidime.
TI  - In vitro effects of a thiopeptide and monensin on ruminal fermentation of soluble carbohydrates.
AB  - Using a purified diet and a mixed culture of ruminal microorganisms, we studied the in vitro effects of a sulfur-containing peptide (A10255) and monensin on ruminal VFA and lactic acid concentrations. After 22 h of fermentation, total VFA concentration was greater in cultures with A10255 and monensin (2.5 ppm each) than in untreated controls (84.1, 91.9, and 65.2 mM for cultures with A10255, monensin, and control, respectively). The molar proportions of propionate were more than 40% greater, and the molar proportions of acetate were about 15% less, in treated than in untreated cultures. The molar proportions of the remaining VFA were lowest in monensin-treated cultures, intermediate in A10255-treated cultures, and greatest in untreated cultures. Addition of A10255 or monensin also prevented the accumulation of lactate and maintained higher pH than in untreated cultures. In pure culture, growth of Streptococcus bovis was slowed by A10255 at pH 5.5 and 6.5. Growth of S. bovis was reduced markedly with addition of monensin at pH 6.5 and inhibited at pH 5.5. Growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus was inhibited more at pH 5.5 than 6.5 with monensin but was unaffected by A10255. The thiopeptide A10255 and monensin inhibited ruminal lactate production, but sensitivities of lactate-producing bacteria differed between compounds.

TI  - [The characteristics of the regulation of lysine biosynthesis in Streptococcus bovis].
AB  - The effect of threonine and methionine on the growth of and lysine synthesis in Streptococcus bovis st. A024/85 was studied. The character and the degree of manifestation of growth and regulation effects of these amino acids depend on their contents in the fermentation medium. The target in the regulation of lysine biosynthesis is aspartate kinase, whose synthesis is controlled by threonine and methionine. Lysine excretion was stimulated by the addition of a low concentration of dimethylsulfoxide in the medium during fermentation.
TI  - Comparison of fluorescent gentamicin-thallous-carbonate and KF streptococcal agars to enumerate enterococci and fecal streptococci in meats.
AB  - Two selective and differential media were compared for their abilities to enumerate enterococci and fecal streptococci in pork, beef, and poultry products. Counts obtained on KF streptococcal (KF) agar were compared with counts obtained on fluorescent gentamicin-thallous-carbonate (fGTC) agar. Reactions of 13 known enterococcal species were also observed. All 13 species of enterococci as well as Streptococcus bovis and Streptococcus equinus grew equally well on fGTC agar. KF streptococcal medium allowed growth of most species of enterococci but not S. bovis and S. equinus. Quantitative comparisons between the two media inoculated with pure cultures of known species of enterococci revealed equivalent plate counts following incubation. However, when meat samples were plated, counts on fGTC agar were consistently and significantly higher than counts on KF agar for all sample sources.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FK-037, a parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK-037, 5-amino-2-[[(6R, 7R)-7-[[(Z)-2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2- methoxyimino) acetyl] amino]-2-carboxy-8-oxo-5-thia-1- azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-en-3-yl]methyl]-1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1H-pyrazoli um hydroxide, inner salt, sulfate (1:1), a new parenteral cephem, was compared with those of cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. FK-037 inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylocci at < or = 4 micrograms/ml. Of 98 isolates of homogenous methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 55 (56.1%) were inhibited by 8 micrograms of FK-037 per ml, compared to 3.1% for cefepime. Imipenem was the most active beta-lactam tested against staphylococci. The MIC of FK-037 for 90% of the strains tested (MIC90) was 0.06 micrograms/ml for hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci, and Streptococcus bovis. The MIC90 for many of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae was 1 microgram/ml, similar to that of cefepime and lower than those of ceftazidime and imipenem. The MIC90 for Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae was 8 micrograms/ml, similar to that for cefepime, but all isolates were inhibited by 2 micrograms of imipenem per ml. K. pneumoniae isolates with cefotaxime and ceftazidime MICs of > 32 micrograms/ml with Bush type 2b' beta-lactamases were inhibited by 4 micrograms of FK-037 per ml. E. cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and S. aureus stably resistant to FK-037 could be selected by repeated transfer in the presence of FK-037. The FK-037 MIC90 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 4 microgram/ml, compared to 32 microgram/ml for cefepime and ceftazidime and 8 microgram/ml for imipenem. Xanthomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas cepacia, Acinetobacter anitratus, and Bacteroides species were resistant to FK-037 (MIC, more than or equal 32 microgram/ml). MBCs were identical to or within twofold of the MICs except for a 32-fold greater MBC for P. aeruginosa. Inoculum size and acid environment did not lower the activity of FK-037. FK-037 was not appreciably hydrolyzed by Bush group 1, 2a, 2b, and 2e beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by 2b' and 2d enzymes at rates comparable to that of ceftazidime. Nonetheless, FK-037 inhibited bacteria possessing TEM-3, -5, and -7 and SHV -5 at less than or equal 8 microgram/ml. Overall, FK-037 has lower MICs against staphylococci and P. aeruginosa than the currently available iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporins and has activity against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae comparable to that of cefepime.
TI  - Diversity of chromosomal genetic elements and gene identification in antibiotic-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - Antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (26 strains) and Streptococcus bovis (28 strains), devoid of R plasmids, were examined for DNA-DNA homology to Tn916 and Tn3701. Tn916-like structures were found in 17 S. pneumoniae and 21 S. bovis strains. Tn916-modified structures were present in 6 S. pneumoniae and 2 S. bovis strains. Two strains of each species carried elements having a Tn3701-like composite structure. All these elements were chromosome-borne. No chromosomal elements were detected in 1 S. pneumoniae and 3 S. bovis strains.

TI  - Scleral flap necrosis and infectious endophthalmitis after cataract surgery with  a scleral tunnel incision.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long scleral tunnel dissection techniques have been developed for cataract surgery incisions. These incisions reduce postoperative astigmatism and keratorefractive instability. If fashioned correctly, the internal lip of the incision produces a tight seal to the anterior chamber, permissible of sutureless surgery. The behavior of such a wound during intraocular infection is unknown. METHODS: The authors describe two elderly patients in whom postoperative bacterial endophthalmitis was accompanied by infectious scleritis, infectious sclerokeratitis or keratitis, and rapid scleral flap necrosis. One of the patients had a painless disease process. RESULTS: Intraocular isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus equinus were recovered from the two patients, respectively. Management was complicated by loss of tectonic integrity that followed scleral flap necrosis, by impaired vitreoretinal visualization associated with rapidly progressive sclerokeratitis or keratitis, and by bacterial scleritis in the base of the scleral flap. No light perception was retained in either eye. CONCLUSION: Scleral tunnel incisions create a potential abscess cavity. Although a rare occurrence, postoperative endophthalmitis in such an eye may present major surgical and therapeutic problems intrinsic to the wound design.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the proBA operon of Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - A genomic DNA library of the rumen bacterium Streptococcus bovis was constructed  in Escherichia coli, and recombinant plasmids able to complement proA and proB mutations of the host were found. Southern hybridization and restriction analysis showed that a 3.5-kb fragment of S. bovis DNA contained two genes, organized in an operon and coding for enzymes functionally similar to the glutamyl phosphate reductase-glutamyl kinase enzyme complex that in E. coli catalyzes the first step of proline biosynthesis. Complementation of the E. coli mutations was observed with the fragment inserted in both orientations, which suggested that the S. bovis proBA operon was transcribed from its own promoter. Genetic and biochemical data suggested that the proline biosynthetic pathway of S. bovis is similar to the one previously characterized for E. coli.
TI  - Streptococci and enterococci associated with tonsils of cattle.
AB  - Streptococcus suis, Streptococcus bovis and the mastitis pathogens Streptococcus  dysgalactiae and Streptococcus uberis were the most frequently occurring streptococci in tonsils of cattle. Streptococcus suis dominated in samples from calves between 1 month and 1 year of age, but was much less frequent in calves less than 1 month old. The mastitis pathogen Strep. dysgalactiae was found more often in calves than in older animals. Enterococci were relatively rare, except in the youngest age group. Nearly one third of the strains examined could not be identified to known species.
TI  - [Occurrence of streptococci resistant to antibiotics in the rumen of calves].
AB  - The occurrence and antibiotic-resistance spectrum of some strains of rumen streptococci were investigated in calves of four age categories in the milk diet period at 1-3, 4-7, 8-14 days of age and 6-8 weeks of age. More than 75% of the strains isolated from the calves of all age categories were resistant to more than one tested antibiotic (tetracycline, neomycin, erythromycin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol). The average number of streptococci isolated from the ingesta of calves during the period of observation was 10(5) per ml. The per cent of resistant strains showed an increasing trend from birth to the age of 8-14 days (Tab. I). The occurrence of resistant strains in 6-8 week calves was even lower than in the calves of the youngest age category. A four-marker type of resistance (41.6-50%) prevailed within 14 days of age. Two-marker types of resistance (42.6%) occurred most frequently in the calves of the oldest age category. Tab. II shows the spectrum of resistant strains. Tetracycline-resistant amylolytic strains of Streptococcus bovis were selected from among the isolated strains to be used as donor strains in conjugation experiments. Successful resistance transmission was observed in solid-surface conjugation. The transmission frequency ranged within the transconjugate values of 10(-3) to 10(-5) per donor cell within the species (Tab. III). A chromosomally rifampicin-resistant strain of Streptococcus bovis BM114 was used as a recipient as it did not contain any plasmids and was sensitive to the tested antibiotics. Agarose-gel electrophoresis was used to visualize the presence of plasmid DNA in donor strains (Fig. 1).
TI  - Prevention of bovine mastitis by a premilking teat disinfectant containing chlorous acid and chlorine dioxide.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a premilking teat disinfectant for the prevention of mastitis in dairy cows under natural exposure conditions. Predipping was compared with a negative control using a split udder experimental design. All teats were dipped after milking with the same teat dip. Percentage of quarters newly infected by major mastitis pathogens was 34% lower in quarters with teats predipped and postdipped than in quarters with teats postdipped only. New IMI by Streptococcus uberis and Staphylococcus aureus were significantly lower in quarters with teats predipped and postdipped than in quarters with teats postdipped only. Differences in incidence of clinical mastitis between treatment groups approached significance. Predipping and postdipping were no more effective against Gram-negative bacteria, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, and Corynebacterium bovis than postdipping only. No chapping or irritation of teats was observed, and no adverse effects were noted using the test product as a premilking and postmilking teat disinfectant. Results of this study suggest that predipping and then postdipping with the test product was a more effective procedure against major mastitis pathogens than postdipping only.
TI  - Development and use of species-specific oligonucleotide probes for differentiation of Streptococcus uberis and Streptococcus parauberis.
AB  - Oligonucleotide probes specific for 16S rRNA and capable of differentiating Streptococcus uberis and S. parauberis from each other and other esculin-hydrolyzing streptococci were developed. Use of a mini-RNA extraction technique for gram-positive cocci associated with bovine mastitis has allowed the probes to be used for identification of esculin-hydrolyzing streptococci from two dairy herds at the Institute for Animal Health, Compton, United Kingdom. One hundred seventy-nine of 206 isolates were identified as S. uberis, 3 were identified as S. parauberis, and 24 were not identified. Isolates not identified by the probes were tested biochemically and found to be mainly Enterococcus faecium, E. faecalis, or S. bovis.
TI  - The efficacy and safety of piperacillin/tazobactam in the therapy of bacteraemia.
AB  - The efficacy of the combination of piperacillin plus tazobactam was studied in 142 patients who had a bacteriologically proven bacteraemia. Seventy-three patients were bacteriologically evaluable and, of these, 55 had a follow-up blood culture; there was no follow-up culture in the other 18 patients, so that any cure could only be presumptive. Of the 55 patients who were fully followed up, 32 received only piperacillin and tazobactam and 23 also received an aminoglycoside. Overall, there were 67 cures and six failures out of 73 evaluable cases (three Staphylococcus aureus, two Staphylococcus epidermidis and one Streptococcus bovis). There were 11 deaths, eight of which occurred in neutropenic patients. In no case was death drug related. Side-effects were mild; the commonest adverse events noted were mild elevations of liver enzymes. Piperacillin plus tazobactam appeared efficacious and safe in the therapy of bacteraemia.
TI  - Comparative effect of salinomycin and monensin on Streptococcus bovis strain ATCC 9809.
AB  - The effect of salinomycin (2.5 mg/l) on the in vitro growth of Streptococcus bovis strain ATCC 9809, on its catabolism of glucose and on its anabolism of lactic acid was compared with that of monensin (5.0 mg/l). In control cultures containing no ionophore, glucose consumption and lactic acid production were completed concomitantly with maximal growth which was reached after 2 h of incubation at 37 degrees C. No further growth of S. bovis was observed within 2 h after the addition of one or the other ionophore to exponentially growing cultures. Glucose consumption and lactic acid production continued for 6 h after the addition of monensin and for 8 h after the addition of salinomycin. As observed in cultures without ionophore, glucose was totally consumed and lactic acid was stoichiometrically produced in cultures grown in the presence of one or the other ionophore. Thus, salinomycin and monensin inhibited bacterial growth but not fermentation of glucose by S. bovis.
TI  - Probiotics and manipulation of rumen development and function.
AB  - There is good evidence that the bacterial and fungal probiotics are effective in  the manipulation of rumen development and function. The effects of adherent Streptococcus bovis preparations were manifested by significant increase of adherent S. bovis bacteria and alpha amylase activity in the rumen wall of young ruminants. Fungal probiotics based on Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus oryzae are rapidly gaining acceptance as a means of improving productivity in adult ruminants. However, fungal probiotics may also have a complementary role to bacterial probiotics in young animals. Dietary yeast improved performance of calves and lambs in terms of feed intake and live weight gain and Aspergillus foetidus was effective in altering rumen fermentation in newly weaned lambs.
TI  - Regulation and cloning of the gene encoding amylase activity of the ruminal bacterium Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis is an important starch-degrading ruminal bacterium that has been implicated as being important in the etiology of a number of ruminal pathologies associated with diets high in grains. Previous studies with S. bovis have shown that amylase production was influenced by the growth substrate, but the nature of this regulation was not determined. The current study was conducted to better describe the regulatory phenomena and gain a better understanding of the molecular characteristics of this activity. Nutritional experiments demonstrated that the presence of starch or the starch-derived disaccharide maltose was required for maximum amylase production. Subsequent time-course experiments showed that amylase synthesis was induced by maltose and repressed by glucose, cellobiose, and fructose, while inulin and lactose had little effect on enzyme accumulation. The effects of the added antibiotics rifampin and tetracycline were consistent with transcriptional control of amylase synthesis. Analysis of S. bovis cells grown on glucose or maltose showed that they contained similar low levels of cyclic AMP, indicating that it was unlikely that regulation of amylase synthesis was mediated through a mechanism involving this nucleotide. The amylase gene from S. bovis JB1 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The amylase produced in E. coli was of lower molecular weight than that synthesized by S. bovis and had catalytic characteristics different from those of S. bovis amylase. When the gene was introduced back into S. bovis JB1, only one form of amylase activity was detected, indicating that the entire gene was present on this insert. The use of the amylase gene as a genetic probe for identification of S. bovis strains is discussed.
TI  - [The effect of culture media on bacteriocin production in various strains of bacteria].
AB  - Some staphylococcus and enterococcus strains were used to investigate the effect  of culture medium on bacteriocin production. Staphylococcus cohnii SC7, Staphylococcus sp. ZTJ 151, S. saprophyticus SS 877, Enterococcus faecium EF1 and E. faecalis EFG2 were isolated from the rumen wall and contents of lambs, calves and fallow deer, Enterococcus gallinarum EG10 and E. avium EA12 were isolated from the caecum of Japanese quail. The tested bacteria belong to producers with a wide antimicrobial effectiveness spectrum, they have low to medium adherence and urease activity (Tab. III). These culture media were used to test the effect of culture medium on bacteriocin production: nutrient agar no. 2 and VL agar enriched with 2% of glucose and lactose (ZAG, ZAL, VLG, VLL), agar for isolation of faecal streptococci (SA) and the base for blood agar no. 4 and no. 2 (KA4, KA2). The strains Streptococcus bovis AO 24/85 and Staphylococcus aureus Oxford 209 P were used as indicator bacteria. Tables I and II show the results of these tests. The tested strains produced the widest inhibition zones (6 mm) with both indicators on SA medium, and this indicates massive bacteriocin production. On ZAG medium, the zones of enterococci with the AO 24/85 strain were larger size than those of staphylococci, but the zones were dim. All strains with the 209P indicator produced dim zones of the 2mm size. The larger inhibition zones (2-5mm) in comparison with staphylococci were observed in enterococci on the ZAL medium with the AO24/85 strain. The production of tested strains was balanced on VLG agar with respect to the use of both indicators.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Infective endocarditis: analysis of 300 episodes].
AB  - PURPOSE: Study of clinical features and etiologic agents, treatment and mortality of patients with infective endocarditis (IE). PATIENTS AND METHODS: 300 episodes of IE occurring in 288 patients, ages ranged between 0.2 and 78 (mean 30.76) years; 185 (62%) episodes occurred in males. RESULTS: a) etiologic agents: viridans group streptococci in 93 (31%) episodes, enterococci en 21 (7%), group D-non enterococci in 19 (6%) (13 S. bovis), other streptococci in 14 (5%), Staphylococcus aureus in 59 (20%), Staphylococcus epidermidis in 14 (5%), gram-negative bacteria in 16 (5%), gram-positive bacteria other than streptococci and staphylococci and staphylococci in 8 (3%), fungi in 4 (1%). The etiologic agents were not identified in 52 (17%) episodes; b) underlying cardiac diseases: valvular heart disease in 119 (40%) episodes, congenital heart disease in 37 (12%), prosthetic heart valves in 69 (23%), other heart diseases in 6 (2%). There was no evidence of previous heart disease in 69 (23%); c) treatment: surgical treatment was undertaken in 102 (34%) episodes. The frequency of surgical treatment in relation to the etiologic agents ranged between 1% (non-group D streptococcus) and 62% (negative blood cultures). The frequency of operation in relation to underlying heart disease ranged between 17% (other heart diseases), 19% (congenital heart disease) and 54% (prosthetic heart valve); d) mortality: 78 (26%) patients died, 56 (28%) of the 198 submitted to medical treatment and 22 (21%) of the 102 submitted also to surgical treatment. The mortality in the different groups of etiologic agents ranged between 5% (non group D streptococcus) and 62% (gram-positive bacteria other than streptococci ans staphylococci); in relation to the underlying with other heart disease, 19% in valvular heart disease patients, 21% in patients with congenital heart disease, 23% in patients without known heart disease and 43% in patients with prosthetic heart valves. CONCLUSION: The mortality associated with IE remains still high in spite of modern treatment; the mortality is different in relation to the cardiac status before the IE.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis endocarditis as a presenting manifestation of idiopathic ulcerative colitis.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis bacteraemia and endocarditis have been associated with several gastrointestinal diseases, mainly malignant or potentially malignant tumours, and less commonly non-malignant gastrointestinal disorders. We describe a 73 year old man in whom Streptococcus bovis endocarditis developed, and was the presenting manifestation of undiagnosed quiescent ulcerative colitis. Such an association has not been described previously.

TI  - Identification and composition of the tonsillar and anal enterococcal and streptococcal flora of dogs and cats.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently isolated enterococcal species from  anal swabs and tonsils of dogs and cats, although in the anal samples from dogs Ent. hirae was found almost as often as Ent. faecalis. Most Ent. faecium strains from dog tonsils differed from those associated with humans and other animals in that they fermented sorbitol. Typical Ent. avium as well as atypical Ent. avium-like strains were seen in dogs, while the related species Ent. raffinosus was associated with cat tonsils. Enterococcus cecorum also occurred mainly in cats. Certain atypical strains, presumptively identified as Ent. cecorum, shared characteristics with Ent. columbae. The most frequent streptococcal species in tonsils of cats and dogs were Streptococcus suis and Strep. canis. Streptococcus canis and Strep. bovis predominated in anal swabs. The canine Strep. suis differed from the common porcine strains in fermenting mannitol. Forty-seven of the 288 isolates examined could not be identified or related to known species. The characteristics of two groups of these bacteria, provisionally called 'Ton 31 group' and 'O7 group' are described.

AB  
TI  - Culture media for enterococci and group D-streptococci.
AB  - Lancefield group D-streptococci are contaminants of various food commodities, especially those of animal origin. They encompass the new genus Enterococcus comprising 13 known species and some species of streptococci which have their habitat in the intestine of animals, e.g. Streptococcus bovis, suis and equinus. The serologically based grouping may no longer constitute the best definition for streptococci from the food chain. Food hygiene monitoring systems using enterococci as indicators need reliable methods for selective cultivation and identification of marker strains. Up to now more than 100 modifications of selective media have been described for isolating streptococci or enterococci from various specimens. The selection of a medium requires either experience or consultation. It depends on the kind of specimen, the method of cultivation (plate count or membrane filter) and whether or not the habitat is heavily contaminated with other organisms. The choice of media is made more difficult as commercial versions of the same culture medium may vary in recipe and/or performance from producer to producer. Therefore, reviewing the literature may help in the choice of medium and confirmation tests. The selectivity and productivity of some commonly used or cited media are reported here, partly based on our own experience: citrate azide tween carbonate agar (CATC), kanamycin aesculin azide agar (KAA) and M-enterococcus agar (ME) including earlier results with aesculin bile azide agar (ABA), and thallous acetate tetrazolium glucose agar (TITG). No medium was completely selective for all group D-streptococci or for all enterococci but some media were highly selective for a single Enterococcus species, e.g., for E. faecalis which serves as indicator of human pollution. Confirmatory tests must be carried out when experience in the evaluation procedure is limited. Selective media for enterococci should be used only after or while checking in parallel their selectivity and productivity against appropriate test organisms.
TI  - Experimental Streptococcus bovis infections in pigeons.
AB  - Thirty pigeons were experimentally infected with Streptococcus bovis using an intravenous infection model. Ninety percent of the inoculated pigeons developed clinical disease. Disease signs included acute death, inability to fly, lameness, inappetence, emaciation, polyuria, and the production of slimy, green droppings. At necropsy, the septicemic character of the disease was evident. Typical lesions included extensive well-circumscribed areas of necrosis in the pectoral muscle, tenosynovitis of the tendon of the Musculus pectoralis profundus, and arthritis of the stifle, tibiotarsal, or shoulder joints. Focal myocardial necrosis also was seen. Meningitis and encephalitis occurred in the cerebrum and the cerebellum. Disease signs and lesions described here after experimental infection were similar to those in naturally occurring cases of S. bovis septicemia.
TI  - Clinicopathology of meningoventriculitis due to Streptococcus bovis infection in  neonatal calves.
AB  - Three neonatal calves ranging in age from 4 to 14 days were examined pathologically and bacteriologically. The calves showed depression, anorexia, pyrexia, and difficulty or inability to stand followed by cloudiness of the ocular aqueous humor or cornea. Autopsy revealed congestion, petechiae, and cloudy areas in the meninges. Histologically, the central nervous system (CNS) lesions were prominent and limited to the meninges where fibrinous exudate and infiltrations of neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes were present. There were mild or slight degrees of choroid plexitis and ependymitis. Endophthalmitis was seen as a concurrent lesion in all cases. Fibrinous or fibrinopurulent changes were found in the peritoneum and epicardium as well as in several other organs. Numerous Gram-positive cocci were detected in affected areas of the whole body. Bacteriologically, Streptococcus bovis was isolated from all examined materials consisting of the brain, cerebrospinal fluid, ocular aqueous humor, and several other organs. These results suggest that the lesions were associated with infection of the organism and that the present cases were in the process of septicemia.
TI  - Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of 16S ribosomal DNA of Streptococcus and Enterococcus species of bovine origin.
AB  - Twelve bacterial species including Streptococcus uberis, S. parauberis, S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae, S. bovis, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. saccharolyticus, Enterococcus faecium, E. faecalis, E. avium, and Aerococcus viridans were examined for their 16S ribosomal DNA fingerprint patterns. Oligonucleotide primers complementary to 16S rRNA genes were used to amplify by the polymerase chain reaction 16S ribosomal gene fragments from genomic DNAs. The molecular sizes of the amplified 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) fragments from the 12 species examined ranged from 1,400 to 1,500 bp. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of 16S rDNA was performed with 11 different restriction endonucleases. All 12 species examined could be differentiated on the basis of characteristic 16S rDNA fingerprint patterns by using the restriction endonucleases HhaI, RsaI, and MspI. A scheme for the differentiation of the 12 species is presented. Eleven isolates representing 11 species were obtained from cows with intramammary infections and were examined by 16S rDNA fingerprinting. All 11 species isolated from cows were differentiated by using HhaI, RsaI, and MspI restriction endonucleases. The results of this study demonstrate the potential application of 16S rDNA fingerprinting for the identification and differentiation of bacterial species.
TI  - Biochemical and antigenic properties of Streptococcus bovis isolated from pigeons.
AB  - Biochemical and serological properties of 60 strains of Streptococcus bovis isolated from healthy pigeons and from pigeons that died from S. bovis septicemia were determined. On the basis of the hemolysis of bovine erythrocytes, the production of polysaccharides on saccharose-containing media, and the fermentation of mannitol, inulin, trehalose, and L-arabinose, the isolates were classified in five biotypes and two subbiotypes. Slide agglutination and microagglutination tests using monospecific rabbit antisera allowed the classification of all isolates in five serotypes.
TI  - The distribution of homologous enterococcal plasmid DNA sequences in human faecal isolates.
AB  - Hybridization was used to investigate the distribution of enterococcal plasmid sequences among 306 strains of Enterococcus and Streptococcus spp. isolated from faeces of humans of various ages. As DNA probes for the survey three plasmids, whose DNAs did not hybridize each other and designated as pMS13, pTW34 and pHK30, were selected from plasmids borne in Ent. faecalis. pTW34 DNA hybridized only with DNAs from enterococci, with high frequency in Ent. faecalis and low frequency in Ent. faecium. pMS13 DNA hybridized with DNAs of all Enterococcus spp. tested and with Strep. bovis, Strep. equinus and Strep. salivarius. Eighty-five percent of Ent. faecium isolates had sequences homologous to pMS13 but in the other species the values were less than 60%. Some enterococci had DNAs which hybridized with the pHK30 probe. The different distribution of the three DNA sequences indicates the possibility that plasmid DNAs encode advantageous phenotypes for the colonization of bacteria in the lumen of the bowel.
TI  - Characterization of enterococcal isolates by restriction enzyme analysis of genomic DNA.
AB  - A restriction enzyme analysis (REA) of chromosomal DNA for the intra-species characterization of enterococci is reported. The DNA was extracted by a rapid method and digested with the restriction enzyme Sal I to provide a characteristic 'fingerprint' consisting of 10-20 bands in the 1.6-5.0 kb range. One hundred and eighty enterococcal isolates were examined; 5 were type strains, 15 from an out-patient clinic and 160 from a geographically isolated British Antarctic Survey Base. The epidemiologically unrelated out-patient clinic isolates gave readily distinguishable patterns, whereas isolates from the geographically isolated community showed evidence of colonization. This technique provided a highly discriminatory method of isolate characterization for Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium and E. durans suitable for epidemiological studies. A sample of isolates were probed with 16 + 23 S ribosomal RNA from Escherichia coli. Discrimination between isolates was poorer than with REA, although good correlation was observed between the results of the two techniques.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis endocarditis associated with colonic adenocarcinoma: report of a case.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis (S. bovis) endocarditis has been increasing over recent decades, especially among the senile population. A 74-year-old man presented with intermittent fever for two months. He had a past history of aortic dissection and underwent a Bentall operation one year before admission. A Janeway lesion was noted on his right hand and six blood cultures grew S. bovis. He was treated with penicillin-G, 3 microU intravenously, every six hours, and became afebrile three days later. A colonofiberoscopy was carried out despite the absence of any gastrointestinal symptoms, and a 2 x 2 cm mass was found at the cecum, with pathologic proof of adenocarcinoma. The patient died from a massive intracranial hemorrhage on the 23rd hospital day. Review of the literature revealed an intimate association between S. bovis bacteremia (or endocarditis) and underlying colonic neoplasia. Failure to be aware of the possible consequences of this combination may lead to detrimental patient prognosis. We strongly advise that every patient presenting with bacteremia or endocarditis due to this organism, even if they are free from gastrointestinal symptoms, should undergo a thorough lower gastrointestinal investigation to rule out colonic neoplasia.

TI  - Tannin-protein complex-degrading enterobacteria isolated from the alimentary tracts of koalas and a selective medium for their enumeration.
AB  - Tannin-protein complex (T-PC)-degrading enterobacteria (T-PCDE) were isolated from the feces and from a layer of bacteria attached to the cecal wall of koalas. The T-PCDE were facultatively anaerobic, gram-negative, pleomorphic, nonmotile bacilli. The bacteria were also oxidase and catalase negative and resistant to vancomycin, reduced nitrates to nitrites, and grew on MacConkey agar. Growth on tannin-treated agar media showed a distinctive clear zone around the colony. From these observations, a selective agar plate medium (vancomycin- and tannin-treated Wilkins-Chalgren anaerobe agar) was developed to enumerate T-PCDE isolated from the feces of koalas. This medium was highly selective in the enumeration of the fecal T-PCDE and inhibited the growth of concomitant T-PC-degrading Streptococcus bovis. The T-PCDE were isolated from 10 of the 12 captive koalas studied; in 8 of these 10 koalas, the facultatively anaerobic bacterial flora was dominated (more than 60%) by T-PCDE. Viable numbers of T-PCDE were, in most of the animals, much larger (more than 100 times) than the numbers of T-PC-degrading S. bovis, suggesting that T-PCDE played a more active role in digesting T-PC in the alimentary tracts of koalas.

TI  - Etiology and antibiotic susceptibility of bloodstream Streptococcus sp.
AB  - 249 episodes of Streptococcus bacteraemia in hospitalized patients were evaluated for both clinical and microbiological features. Specification of the isolates demonstrated that infective endocarditis was predominantly associated with Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus bovis whereas Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus milleri were the most common cause of local and/or systemic infections. In vitro-susceptibility tests towards 9 selected antibiotics proved that beta-lactam antibiotics are potent compounds for the treatment of Streptococcus sp. with the exception of enterococci; that ampicillin turned out to be highly effective against enterococci; and that vancomycin may be regarded as a potent alternative in the treatment of streptococcal infections.
TI  - Microflora of the pouch of the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus).
AB  - Microflora of the pouch epithelium of 17 female koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) were examined in relation to their current reproductive status and recent reproductive history. No microbial growth was observed in pouch swabs from 13 of 17 (76%) koalas, including four females without young, seven with pouch young and two with back young (i.e. permanently emerged from the pouch). Growth of bacteria or yeasts was observed in pouch swabs from four koalas, each of which had experienced mortality of its pouch young during the current breeding season. Seven species of microorganisms were isolated, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Enterococcus faecalis. Based on the absence of microflora in the majority of females examined, we propose that the pouch epithelium normally provides a hostile environment for microbial colonization.
TI  - Antimutagenicity of milk cultured with lactic acid bacteria against N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine.
AB  - The antimutagenic effect of cultured milk using 71 strains of lactic acid bacteria belonging to the genus Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Lactococcus, and Bifidobacterium on the mutagenicity of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine was investigated in vitro using Salmonella typhimurium TA 100 as an indicator bacterium. Each cultured milk sample displayed its characteristic antimutagenic effect on the mutagenicity of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. The milk cultured with Lactobacillus acidophilus LA 106 (LA2) showed the highest inhibition of 77% against the mutagenicity of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine among the strains tested. Changes in the antimutagenic effect of the milk cultured by Lb. acidophilus LA 106 (LA2) during incubation were also examined using N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine as a mutagen.

TI  - 4-week treatment of streptococcal native valve endocarditis with high-dose teicoplanin.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of a 4-week course of intravenous teicoplanin (500 mg every 12 h for the first 2 days and 10 mg/kg of body weight every 24 h thereafter) in the treatment of streptococcal native valve endocarditis in 20 patients were evaluated. All blood isolates were inhibited by a concentration of 0.12 micrograms of teicoplanin per ml. Serum bactericidal activity levels were measured 1/2 and 24 h after antibiotic infusion on days 5 to 7 of therapy in 19 patients, and titers of greater than or equal to 1:32 and greater than or equal to 1:8, respectively, were obtained with 17 patients (89%). On the other hand, for two patients who were infected with teicoplanin-tolerant Streptococcus bovis, serum bactericidal activity levels of less than 1:2 were found. Of 20 patients, 4 were excluded from further analysis because of protocol violation or prosthetic valve infection. Of the remaining 16 patients, 6 did not complete teicoplanin therapy because of early death (1 patient) or drug fever (5 patients). Among patients who developed drug fever, three who discontinued teicoplanin by day 15 were switched to penicillin therapy, whereas the remaining two, who discontinued teicoplanin on day 22 and 25, respectively, did not receive any further therapy and have shown no relapse during the follow-up. Of 10 patients who completed trial therapy, 9 were cured and 1 relapsed. It is concluded that a 4-week course of high-dose teicoplanin may be a useful regimen for home treatment of selected cases of streptococcal native valve endocarditis. However, drug fever and infection with teicoplanin-tolerant S. bovis may be factors of concern with this therapeutic approach.
TI  - [Septic arthritis due to Streptococcus bovis].
AB  - A 47-year-old man presented with arthritis of the right shoulder and spondylodiscitis by Streptococcus bovis. This microorganism is a frequent cause of endocarditis and has been associated with gastrointestinal neoplasm, mainly carcinoma of the colon; however up to the present it had not been described as an causal agent of septic arthritis. The studies carried out on the patient permitted the exclusion of the existence of a digestive neoplasm and endocarditis. Despite a prolonged evolution prior to treatment with elevated doses of penicillin G and not requiring surgical drainage, the evolution was good and no destructive lesions were produced in the shoulder joint. Hematogenous infections (in this case septic arthritis) by Streptococcus bovis may present in patients without gastrointestinal diseases or endocarditis, possibly have a low damage to skeletal structures and respond adequately to conventional treatment with penicillin G.
TI  - Enterococcal and streptococcal species isolated from faeces of calves, young cattle and dairy cows.
AB  - Faeces from non-ruminating calves were found to contain several species of enterococci: Enterococcus avium, Ent. cecorum, Ent. durans, Ent. faecalis, Ent. faecium and Ent. hirae. Enterococcus faecalis was the most frequent. Few of these animals carried streptococci. Streptococcus bovis largely predominated in ruminating calves, young cattle and dairy cows. Other streptococci as well as enterococci were infrequent in dairy cows, but a variety of other streptococci and enterococci were found in the faeces of young ruminating animals.
TI  - Interaction of ruminal bacteria in the production and utilization of maltooligosaccharides from starch.
AB  - The degradation and utilization of starch by three amylolytic and one nonamylolytic species of ruminal bacteria were studied. Pure cultures of Streptococcus bovis JB1, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49, and Bacteroides ruminicola D31d rapidly hydrolyzed starch and maltooligosaccharides accumulated. The major starch hydrolytic products detected in S. bovis cultures were glucose, maltose, maltotriose, and maltotetraose. In addition to these oligosaccharides, B. fibrisolvens cultures produced maltopentaose. The products of starch hydrolysis by B. ruminicola were even more complex, yielding glucose through maltotetraose, maltohexaose, and maltoheptaose but little maltopentaose. Selenomonas ruminantium HD4 grew poorly on starch, digested only a small portion of the available substrate, and generated no detectable oligosaccharides as a result of cultivation in starch containing medium. S. ruminantium was able to grow on a mixture of maltooligosaccharides and utilize those of lower degree (less than 10) of polymerization. A coculture system containing S. ruminantium as a dextrin-utilizing species and each of the three amylolytic bacteria was developed to test whether the products of starch hydrolysis were available for crossfeeding to another ruminal bacterium. Cocultures of S. ruminantium and S. bovis contained large numbers of S. bovis but relatively few S. ruminantium and exhibited little change in the pattern of maltooligosaccharides observed for pure cultures of S. bovis. In contrast, S. ruminantium was able to compete with B. fibrisolvens and B. ruminicola for these growth substrates. When grown with B. fibrisolvens, S. ruminantium grew to high numbers and maltooligosaccharides accumulated to a much lesser degree than in cultures of B. fibrisolvens alone. S. ruminantium-B. ruminicola cultures contained large numbers of both species, and maltooligosaccharides never accumulated in these cocultures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The effect of pH on the heat production and membrane resistance of Streptococcus  bovis.
AB  - Non-growing cultures of Streptococcus bovis JB1 which were incubated in 2-[N-moropholino] ethane-sulfonic acid (MES)-phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) and glucose (2 g/l) produced heat at a rate of 0.17 mW/mg protein, and this rate was proportional to the enthalpy change of the homolactic fermentation. Since the growth-independent heat production could be eliminated by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), an inhibitor of F1F0 ATPases, it appeared that virtually all of the energy was being used to counteract proton flux through the cell membrane. When the pH was decreased from 6.8 to 5.8, heat production and glucose consumption increased, the electrical potential (delta psi) declined, the chemical gradient of protons (Z delta pH) increased, and there was a small increase in total protonmotive force (delta p). Further decreases in pH (5.8 to 4.5) caused a marked decrease in heat production and glucose consumption even though there was only a small decline in membrane voltage. Based on the enthalpy of ATP (4 kcal or 16.8 kJ/mol), it appeared that 38% of the wattage was passing through the cell membrane. The relationship between membrane voltage and membrane wattage or glucose consumption was non-linear (non-ohmic), and it appeared that the resistance of the membrane to current flow was not constant. Based on the electrical formula, resistance = voltage2/wattage and resistance = voltage/amperage, there was a marked increase in membrane resistance when the pH was less than 6.0. The increase in membrane resistance at low pH allowed S. bovis to maintain its membrane potential and expend less energy when its ability to ferment glucose was impaired.
TI  - Rheumatic manifestations of infective endocarditis.
AB  - Rheumatic manifestations are common and varied in infective endocarditis. We performed a retrospective case analysis on 87 patients with 93 episodes of infective endocarditis admitted to Flinders Medical Centre over an 11 year period (1980-1990). Disabling musculoskeletal symptoms and signs were documented in 22 (25%) of the patients. Thirteen patients developed severe or moderately severe low back pain during their illness, two with radiological evidence of a septic discitis or vertebral osteomyelitis. Two patients developed polyarthralgia/arthritis, four had septic arthritis (all with acute Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis), three developed severe loin pain, two acute gout, two had severe buttock pain and sacroiliac joint tenderness and two each developed disabling jaw/facial pain, neck/scapular pain and flank pain respectively. Five patients presented initially to the orthopaedic or rheumatological unit for management of their musculoskeletal symptoms. Four of seven patients with Streptococcus bovis endocarditis demonstrated prominent low back pain supporting a previously noted association between this organism and back symptoms. Furthermore, in one patient who had three separate episodes of endocarditis involving three different organisms, florid back symptoms were only seen in the infective episode involving Streptococcus bovis.
TI  - Cloning and expression of an amylase gene from Streptococcus bovis in Escherichia coli.
AB  - An amylase gene was identified in a Streptococcus bovis 033 lambda gtWES lambda B genomic library. Using a starch overlay and a Congo red-iodine staining procedure, amylase positive clones could be identified by zones of clearing. Ten amylase positive clones were identified using this procedure. The clone chosen for further study, lambda SBA105, contained an insert of approximately 7.5 kb. The insert was mapped, and subcloning localized the amylase gene to a region of approximately 3.1 kb. Cloning of the 3.1 kb amylase fragment into pUC18 in both orientations revealed that the amylase gene was transcribed from its own promoter. Amylase activity was expressed by the Escherichia coli subclones and was found to be largely associated with the cytoplasmic fraction. Southern hybridization of genomic DNA from the amylolytic strains, S. bovis 033, S. bovis 077, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 194 and 195 revealed a single hybridizing band in S. bovis 033 DNA only. This indicates that the amylase gene from S. bovis may differ from the amylases of these other amylolytic bacteria.
TI  - Adherence of ruminal Streptococcus bovis and Lactobacillus strains to primary and secondary cultures of rumen epithelium.
AB  - Six strains of rumen Lactobacillus and four Streptococcus bovis strains isolated  from rumen wall and fluid samples were examined for the adherence to cells of primary and secondary cultures of ruminal epithelium (REC) prepared from sheep and calf. S. bovis adhered to the keratinized REC. Ruminal lactobacilli did not adhere. The presence of rumen lactobacilli in mixture had no influence on the adherence of S. bovis strains. No difference was observed in the adherence of tested bacteria to epithelial cells of primary or secondary cultures, but adhesion was only detected on keratinized cells.
TI  - [Problems posed by the association of streptococcus D infectious endocarditis and colorectal tumor].
AB  - The problems arising from the discovery of a colorectal tumor during an infectious endocarditis caused by Streptococci D have rarely been mentioned in the surgical literature. The frequency of association of an asymptomatic colorectal tumor and of a Streptococcus bovi endocarditis is now undisputed. This notion implies the systematic search for an intestinal lesion (adenoma or carcinoma) in case of endocarditis or septicemia without involvement of the valves, caused by a streptococcus of group D. The authors report about 3 cases of enterococcal (1 case) and S. bovis (2 cases) infectious endocarditis revealing a colic adenocarcinoma (2 cases) and a villous adenoma (1 case), all being perfectly latent. The specific therapeutic problems arising from this association are outlined, including the antibiotic therapy, the role of the anticoagulant treatment and the priority given to valve surgery in case of hemodynamic instability.
TI  - [Evaluation of usefulness of the PYR-Wellcome test for identifying microorganisms from the genus enterococcus].
AB  - The study was aimed at evaluation of usefulness of PYR-Wellcome test in bacteriological diagnostic. Results of identification of enterococcal strains by application of the above test were performed on 157 strains of Enterococcus spp., 15 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and 12 of Streptococcus bovis. Application of test for PYR-ase production results in shortening of diagnostic procedure. Basing on morphological features, including type of hemolysis, lack of catalase production and presence in the bacterial cell of a peptidase hydrolyzing L-pirrolidonyl-beta-naphthylamide, it is possible to classify with high probability the investigated microorganism to the Enterococcus spp. The Shortened procedure is satisfactory for routine identification of enterococcal strains in diagnostic laboratories.
TI  - DAP-decarboxylase activity and lysine production by rumen bacteria.
AB  - The last step of pathway of lysine biosynthesis by rumen bacteria was tested. The first measurements of DAP-decarboxylase activity and of lysine production by Megasphera elsdenii, Selenomonas ruminantium, Clostridium spp., Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and Bacteroides succinogenes as well as the first attempts to increase the lysine production by ruminal streptococci by mutation are described. The highest values were measured in Selenomonas ruminantium (DAP-decarboxylase activity = 146 micrograms DAP.min-1.mg-1 protein and lysine production was 390 micrograms.mg-1 protein) and the lowest values were ascertained in Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens (DAP-decarboxylase activity = 27 micrograms DAP.min-1.mg-1 protein and lysine production was 32 micrograms.mg-1 protein). DAP-decarboxylase activity was increased by mutation especially in Streptococcus bovis, the lysine production in both of tested ruminal streptococci. The potential use of lysine-excreting mutants in calves in future is suggested.
TI  - Effect of growth conditions on the Streptococcus bovis phosphoenolpyruvate glucose phosphotransferase system.
AB  - Four strains of the ruminal bacterium Streptococcus bovis were surveyed for phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and ATP-dependent phosphorylation of glucose and the nonmetabolizable glucose analog 2-deoxyglucose. All four strains had high rates of glucose phosphorylation with either phosphoryl donor, but 2-deoxyglucose activity was much higher in the presence of PEP. These results provide evidence for a PEP-dependent glucose phosphotransferase system in these bacteria. Mannose and 2-deoxyglucose inhibited PEP-dependent phosphorylation of glucose by S. bovis JB1 by 50 and 38%, respectively, whereas alpha-methylglucoside had little effect. Mannose was a competitive inhibitor of PEP-dependent phosphorylation of glucose with an inhibition constant of 2.8 mM, and PEP-dependent activity in cells grown in batch culture was optimal at pH 7.2. When S. bovis JB1 was grown in continuous culture, PEP-dependent phosphorylation of glucose and 2-deoxyglucose was highest in cells grown at a dilution rate of .10/h and at low glucose concentrations. Phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent activity was optimum at a growth pH of 5.0 for cells grown in medium that contained less than 6.0 g/liter of glucose. These data indicate that PEP-dependent glucose phosphotransferase system activity can be influenced depending on the growth conditions used to culture S. bovis. Furthermore, these results suggest that environmental conditions within the rumen will affect how glucose is transported by S. bovis.
TI  - [In vitro bactericidal effect of temafloxacin and tosufloxacin against streptococci].
AB  - Tosufloxacin tosylate (TOSU) and temafloxacin hydrochloride (TEMA) were tested in vitro against 248 clinical isolates of various species of streptococci recovered in a hospital microbiology laboratory (Bellevue Regional Teaching Hospital). Species included S. pneumoniae (n = 20), group A streptococci (n = 22), group B streptococci (n = 30), group G streptococci (n = 17), group D S. bovis (n = 19), Enterococcus faecium (n = 45), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 28), S. sanguis (n = 21), S. milleri (n = 29) and S. mitis (n = 17). Activities of each of the two study drugs were evaluated comparatively with two other fluoroquinolones, i.e., ciprofloxacin (CIP) and pefloxacin (PEF). Activities of each of these four antibiotics, expressed as the MIC 90%, varied as follows according to the species of streptococci: TOSU, 0.25 to 1 mg/l, TEMA 0.5 to 2 mg/l, CIP, 1 to 4 mg/l and PEF 8 to 32 mgl. Overall, TOSU and TEMA exhibited the greatest activity of the various species. The size of the inoculum had no significant effect on MIC values.
TI  - [Streptococcus bovis meningitis and sepsis in neonates: report of two cases].
AB  - Streptococcus bovis is a veterinary organism rarely previously reported in the neonatal infection. Two cases are presented of neonatal infection by this organism; one case manifested with meningitis and the other, with sepsis. Seizure and respiratory distress were the symptoms found in these two babies, respectively. Following adequate treatment, recovery was complete, and the infants enjoyed healthy lives post-discharge. S. bovis is always sensitive to penicillin, but resistant strain has been reported recently. It is reasonable to treat infant patients infected by this organism with a combined initial therapy of penicillin and aminoglycoside. After the minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration of antibiotic has been determined, penicillin or ampicillin can be used alone.
TI  - Intracellular pH of acid-tolerant ruminal bacteria.
AB  - Acid-tolerant ruminal bacteria (Bacteroides ruminicola B1(4), Selenomonas ruminantium HD4, Streptococcus bovis JB1, Megasphaera elsdenii B159, and strain F) allowed their intracellular pH to decline as a function of extracellular pH and did not generate a large pH gradient across the cell membrane until the extracellular pH was low (less than 5.2). This decline in intracellular pH prevented an accumulation of volatile fatty acid anions inside the cells.
TI  - Preliminary observations of interaction between bacteriophages and Streptococcus  bovis bacteria on ruminal epithelium primoculture.
AB  - Five Streptococcus bovis strains (47/3, 59/2, 4/1, 46/2 and 44/9) isolated from calf ruminal fluid samples were examined for the adherence to cultured ruminal epithelium cells. Four strains (47/3, 59/2, 4/1 and 46/2) were able to attach to the cultured epithelial cells. However, S. bovis 47/3 strain attached to the target cells in significantly greater numbers than the other strains. Strain 44/9 did not adhere to cells of ruminal epithelium. The adherent bacteria were observed on the surface of differentiated (mainly keratinized) cells of ruminal epithelium primoculture only. The different effect of F4, F5 and F6 bacteriophages was ascertained on S. bovis bacteria adhering to rumen epithelial primoculture. A significant decrease in the number of adherent bacteria was shown after cultivation of strains 47/3 and 4/1 with F6 bacteriophage and of 47/3 strain with F4 phage. The F5 bacteriophage had no significant effect on these bacteria.
TI  - Phenotypic characterization of CO2-requiring strains of Streptococcus bovis from  koalas.
AB  - We examined phenotypic characteristics of six mannitol-fermenting strains of Streptococcus bovis, including two unusual CO2-requiring strains isolated from koala feces. These strains did not grow in air, but grew in air supplemented with CO2 and under reduced oxygen conditions. All six strains had the same biochemical characteristics, except that the CO2-requiring strains did not produce beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase.
TI  - Selection and application of Streptococcus bovis as a silage inoculant.
AB  - Three strains of Streptococcus bovis, a homolactic bacterium capable of utilizing starch, were evaluated for growth kinetics and ability to decrease the pH of alfalfa silage. A selected strain was evaluated for its competitiveness as an inoculant with Enterococcus faecium, an organism used in inoculants, and for its ability to enhance the effect of a commercial inoculant. Testing was completed over three studies using wilted alfalfa (28 to 34% dry matter) ensiled into laboratory silos. Treatments were control, E. faecium, E. faecium and commercial inoculant, S. bovis, and S. bovis and commercial inoculant. Replicate silos were emptied and analyzed at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 40 days for pH, fermentation products, and nitrogen fractions. S. bovis alone lowered the pH quicker and improved silage parameters early in the fermentation compared with E. faecium, the commercial inoculant, and control treatments. When combined with a commercial inoculant, S. bovis lowered pH more quickly than the commercial inoculant alone and E. faecium plus commercial inoculant. At 40 days, S. bovis combination had lower pH and ammonia nitrogen and acetate contents than the E. faecium combination. Starch in the silage was not utilized by S. bovis as had been anticipated. Results indicate that S. bovis was more effective than E. faecium as a silage inoculant and could enhance a commercial inoculant on low-dry-matter alfalfa.
TI  - Fecal carriage of Streptococcus bovis and colorectal adenomas.
AB  - An association between fecal carriage of Streptococcus bovis and colorectal carcinoma has been reported. A relationship between S. bovis and colorectal adenomas has also been suggested. In the present study, the relationship between S. bovis and adenomas was investigated. Two of 18 current adenoma patients (11%) were found to have S. bovis in their stool compared with 12 of 84 controls (14%). Six of 38 patients who had ever had a diagnosis of adenoma (16%) had S. bovis compared with 8 of 64 controls (13%). These results rule out a strong association between fecal carriage of S. bovis and adenomas; however, because of the relatively small sample size, a weak to moderate association cannot be excluded.
TI  - Multiple brain abscesses caused by Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - A case of multiple brain abscesses caused by Streptococcus bovis in a 28-year-old man is described. Infected bronchiectasis is presumed to be the source of infection. Streptococcus bovis infection is a rare cause of brain abscess. The aetiology and manifestations of this infection are discussed.
TI  - A survey of peptidase activity in rumen bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-nine strains of 14 species of rumen bacteria were screened for their ability to hydrolyse Ala2, Ala5, GlyArg-4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide (GlyArg-MNA) and Leu-MNA. Several species, notably Megasphaera elsdenii, were active against Ala2, and a smaller number, including Bacteroides ruminicola, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Lachnospira multipara and Ruminobacter amylophilus, broke down Ala5. Streptococcus bovis had an exceptionally high leucine arylamidase activity. However, only Ba. ruminicola hydrolysed GlyArg-MNA. Further investigation revealed that only Ba. ruminicola and Bu. fibrisolvens hydrolysed Ala5 to Ala3 and Ala2, with little ALa4 being produced, in a manner similar to rumen fluid. The activity of Ba. ruminicola against synthetic peptidase substrates, including GlyArg-MNA, LysAla-MNA, ArgArg-MNA, GlyPro-MNA, LeuVal-MNA, and Ala3-p-nitroanilide, was similar to that of rumen fluid, whereas the activity of Bu. fibrisolvens was quite different. Since the main mechanism by which peptides are broken down in the rumen is similar to dipeptidyl aminopeptidase type I, for which GlyArg-MNA is a diagnostic substrate, it was concluded that Ba. ruminicola was the most important single species in peptide breakdown in the rumen.
TI  - Introduction of Tn916 and pAM beta 1 into Streptococcus bovis JB1 by conjugation.
AB  - The transposon Tn916 and self-mobilizing plasmid pAM beta 1 were conjugated from  Enterococcus faecalis to the ruminal bacterium Streptococcus bovis JB1. Transconjugants were identified by resistance to tetracycline (Tn916) or erythromycin (pAM beta 1) and by Southern hybridization analyses. Transfer frequencies were 7.0 x 10(-6) and 1.0 x 10(-6) per recipient cell for Tn916 and pAM beta 1, respectively. The transconjugants JB1/Tn916 and JB1/pAM beta 1 were used as donors for matings with E. faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and the ruminal bacterium Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. While pAM beta 1 was successfully transferred to all three organisms, Tn916 was transferred only into B. subtilis and B. fibrisolvens at very low frequencies. This is the first report of conjugal DNA transfers between two ruminal organisms.
TI  - Streptococcus salivarius meningitis and colonic carcinoma.
AB  - Streptococcus salivarius caused fulminant meningitis in an elderly patient. A gastrointestinal diagnostic workup revealed an asymptomatic colonic adenocarcinoma. This first reported instance of S salivarius sepsis associated with a colonic neoplasm is not unexpected, since the organism is bacteriologically similar to S bovis, the prime bacterial indicator of occult malignancy. Exact speciation of streptococcal strains is fraught with technical difficulties, and gastrointestinal investigation may be warranted in an expanded variety of streptococcal infections.
TI  - Differentiation of enterococci from other group D streptococci by means of a specific monoclonal antibody.
AB  - We report on the specificity of a monoclonal antibody which reacts with autoclaved extracts of four species of enterococci but does not react to the same extent with similar extracts from two non-enterococcal group D streptococci. The monoclonal antibody also reacts specifically with purified lipoteichoic acid from Streptococcus faecalis but not significantly with purified lipoteichoic acid from the non-enterococcal species Streptococcus bovis and Streptococcus equinus. The specific antigen detected with this antibody could correlate with the definition of the enterococcus subgroup of the streptococci which would provide further evidence that this sub-group is taxonomically distinct from the other group D streptococci.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis septicaemia associated with uncomplicated colonic carcinoma.
AB  
TI  - [Cloning the alpha-amylase gene of Streptococcus bovis and its expression in Bacillus subtilis cells].
AB  - The gene coding for alpha-amylase from the ruminant bacterium Streptococcus bovis was cloned on the plasmid pMX39 in Bacillus subtilis cells. An alpha-amylase positive colony was isolated in the initial screening of 3900 colonies on the medium containing insoluble starch. The size of the insert was approximately 2.8 kb. The recombinant plasmid was stably maintained in Bacillus subtilis cells under the nonselective conditions.
TI  - Enumeration by a miniaturized method of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus bovis and enterococci as indicators of the origin of faecal pollution of waters.
AB  - Counts of Escherichia coli, faecal streptococci and enterococci were made on faecal specimens from human and animal origin and urban raw sewage waters, with microtiter plates containing selective substances. Escherichia coli was more numerous than faecal streptococci and enterococci in 80% of the samples regardless of the origin. Consequently the use of the ratio E. coli/faecal streptococci to distinguish human from animal origin of faecal pollution is questionable. Enterococcus faecalis was predominant in human and poultry faeces, Streptococcus bovis was typical of the bovine faeces and to a lesser extent also of pig faeces whereas Enterococcus durans, Ent. hirae and Ent. faecium did not characterize any faecal source. Streptococcus bovis could be distinguished in the microtiter plate by its inability to reduce triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) in the medium.
TI  - In-vitro activity of WIN 57273 compared to the activity of other fluoroquinolones and two beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - WIN 57273, a new fluoroquinolone, was four to 128-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria. The MIC90 for Staphylococcus aureus was 0.015 mg/l and for S. epidermidis, 0.03 mg/l. All Lancefield group A, B, C, & G streptococci, Streptococcus bovis and S. pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l compared to 0.5 mg/l for tosufloxacin and 2 mg/l for ciprofloxacin. For anaerobic bacteria WIN 57273 had an MIC90 for bacteroides of 1 mg/l, and for Clostridium spp. 0.015.mg/l. WIN 57273 was less active than ciprofloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae, with an MIC90 of 1 mg/l, including aminoglycoside and cephalosporin-resistant isolates. The MIC90 of WIN 57273 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 2 mg/l, compared to 0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin. Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Legionella spp. were inhibited by 0.06 mg/l. WIN 57273 was more active against Gram-negative bacteria at acid pH, but activity was decreased by magnesium ions and an increase in inoculum. Resistant strains were selected after passage on antibiotic-containing agar.
TI  - Phage resistance and altered growth habit in a strain of Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - Bacteriophage (phi Sb01) of Streptococcus bovis, isolated from pooled rumen fluid of cattle, was a small siphovirus of morphotype B1. It contained double-stranded DNA of length 30.9 kb, which was digested by the restriction endonucleases, EcoRI, HindIII, and PvuII. Bacteria which survived phi Sb01 infection (strain 2BAr) grew in long chains (100-200 cells), ultimately forming large clumps of cells. This growth habit was in distinct contrast to that of the parent host strain which grew predominantly in the form of single cells or diplococci. Strain 2BAr was genetically stable, resistant to phi Sb01 attack, and the observed differences in the growth characteristics of the parent strain and 2BAr indicated that cells of 2BAr were more adherent. In the rumen ecosystem, the selection of phage-resistant bacteria with altered growth characteristics may be a factor in modifying bacterial phenotypes, and thus increasing variability among bacteria which are closely related genetically.
TI  - The influence of agricultural run-off on bacterial populations in a river.
AB  - The microbiological quality of the River Riato (Spain) was evaluated. The influence of cattle that roam free in the warm season was marked. The degree of faecal pollution in the river was higher than predicted from the river basin geographical characteristics. The counts of faecal indicators greatly increased when the cattle were allowed to roam free. Counts of enterobacteria and faecal coliforms ranged from 10(3) to 10(6)/100 ml. Faecal streptococci counts were smaller (less than 10/100 ml). Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated from all samples. Streptococcus bovis was also isolated but not Strep. faecalis.
TI  - The presence of two forms of the phosphocarrier protein HPr of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system in streptococci.
AB  - The protein, HPr, a necessary component of the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (PTS) in bacteria, was purified from Streptococcus salivarius by column chromatography. The purified preparation gave only one band when analyzed by sodium dodecylsulfate gel electrophoresis or by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel (pI = 4.85). However, electrophoresis in Tris-containing buffers under non-denaturing conditions revealed 2 bands that could be phosphorylated by PEP in the presence of enzyme I of the PTS or by ATP with the HPr kinase. Homogeneous preparations of these 2 forms could be obtained by preparative electrophoresis. Each preparation exhibited only 1 band when analyzed by electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions, indicating that the doublet observed before preparative electrophoresis was not an electrophoretic artefact. The electrophoretic mobility of each protein was not modified following heat-treatment at 100 degrees C for 20 min or storage at -40 degrees C for several months. Both HPr proteins catalyzed in vitro the PEP-dependent phosphorylation of glucose, but at a rate slightly lower than that observed with a preparation of HPr containing both forms of the protein. Both forms were also able to transfer the phosphate group from PEP to the other specific PTS proteins known in S salivarius. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against each form reacted with both proteins. The presence of the 2 forms of HPr was detected in fresh cellular extracts of S salivarius; however, their intracellular ratio varied according to growth conditions. A doublet was also found in many other streptococcal species tested (S mutans, S sobrinus, S sanguis, S thermophilus, S bovis, S rattus) and also in L lactis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Group D streptococci and enterococci: identification, sensitivity to antibiotics and a study of the high level resistance to aminosides (Charles Nicolle Hospital in Tunis)].
AB  - 197 strains of enterococcus and group D Streptococcus were isolated from human material at Charles Nicolle Hospital (Tunis) and identified by biochemical tests: 174, Enterococcus faecalis, 6 Enterococcus faecium, 2 Enterococcus durans and 15 Streptococcus bovis. The sensitivity to antibiotics was studied: all Enterococcus faecium were resistant at least to one antibiotic, 15% of Enterococcus faecalis were sensitive for all antibiotics tested the other species were frequently sensitive. High level resistance to aminoglycosides were frequent in Enterococcus faecalis 40%: among these strains high level resistance to gentamicin accounts for 12% and 18 frequently associated with resistance to kanamycin and streptomycin, this situation present therapeutic problems in case of severe infection.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of Vitek gram-positive identification system and API Rapid Strep system for identification of Streptococcus species of bovine origin.
AB  - The Vitek Gram-positive identification system (GPI, Vitek Systems, Inc., Hazelwood, MO) and the API Rapid Strep system (Analytab Products, Plainview, NY) were evaluated for species identification of streptococci isolated from bovine mammary glands and compared to conventional biochemical methods. A total of 144 strains including Streptococcus uberis (60), S. dysgalactiae (32), S. agalactiae (15), S. bovis (15), Enterococcus faecium (10) and Ent. faecalis (12) were evaluated. All reference strains were identified correctly by both systems. Vitek GPI card system identified 94.4% of strains, including 95% of S. uberis, 93.8% of S. dygalactiae, 93.3% of S. agalactiae and S. bovis II, 90% of Ent. faecium and 100% of Ent. faecalis. Majority of strains were identified with a 90-99% level of confidence, with an average of 8 h needed for identification. The API Rapid Strep system identified 96.5% of strains correctly, including 95% of S. 96.9% of S. dysgalactiae, 93.3% of S. agalactiae, and 100% of S. bovis II, Ent. faecium, and Ent. faecalis. Majority of strains were identified with excellent level of identification. With the exception of S. uberis, most strains were identified at 4 h of incubation.
TI  - Evaluation of two fluorogenic assays for identification of Streptococcus species  isolated from bovine mammary glands.
AB  - Liquid and agar assays that utilized 4-methylumbelliferyl-conjugated beta-D-glucuronide, beta-D-galactoside, or N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminide, and agglutination by Dolichos biflorus lectin were evaluated for identification of Streptococcus species isolated from bovine mammary glands. A greater number of Streptococcus uberis isolates were negative for N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase by the liquid assay compared with the agar assay. Enzyme profiles for Streptococcus dysgalactiae were similar by both assays. Streptococcus dysgalactiae was the only species that agglutinated when mixed with lectin from D. biflorus. Most Streptococcus agalactiae isolates were positive for beta-D-glucuronidase and beta-D-galactosidase by both assays. Two Streptococcus equinus strains had negative enzyme profiles by the liquid assay; however, both strains had enzyme profiles consistent for S. equinus by the agar method. Incorporation of 4-methylumbelliferyl-conjugated substrates into trypticase soy agar did not appear to alter agar characteristics and eliminated aliquoting substrates and inoculating tubes. More than one enzyme profile was produced per Streptococcus species or serogroup by both methods. However, some profiles were similar between species, which hindered accurate identification of Streptococcus species.
TI  - [Prospective study of routine screening for cirrhosis and colonic tumors associated with Streptococcus bovis bacteremia].
AB  - Between 1987 and 1990, seven patients hospitalized in our hospital had bacteremia caused by Streptococcus bovis. Complete gastrointestinal evaluation was routinely carried out for digestive portal of entry and liver disease screening. In four cases (2 bacteremia, 2 endocarditis), a colonic growth was detected: sigmoid adenoma (n = 1) and rectosigmoid carcinoma (n = 4); in one case (endocarditis), several rectosigmoid carcinomas were associated with alcoholic cirrhosis; in one case (bacteremia), alcoholic cirrhosis was diagnosed; in one case (endocarditis), no gastrointestinal or hepatic portal of entry was found. These cases emphasize the need for simultaneous detection of endocarditis and gastrointestinal portal of entry such as colonic tumor and/or cirrhosis, in case of Streptococcus bovis bacteremia.
TI  - Resistance of Streptococcus bovis to acetic acid at low pH: relationship between  intracellular pH and anion accumulation.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis JB1, an acid-tolerant ruminal bacterium, was able to grow at  pHs from 6.7 to 4.5, and 100 mM acetate had little effect on growth rate or proton motive force across the cell membrane. When S. bovis was grown in glucose-limited chemostats at pH 5.2, the addition of sodium acetate (as much as 100 mM) had little effect on the production of bacterial protein. At higher concentrations of sodium acetate (100 to 360 mM), production of bacterial protein declined, but this decrease could largely be explained by a shift in fermentation products (acetate, formate, and ethanol production to lactate production) and a decline in ATP production (3 ATP per glucose versus 2 ATP per glucose). YATP (grams of cells per mole of ATP) was not decreased significantly even by high concentrations of acetate. Cultures supplemented with 100 mM sodium acetate took up [14C]acetate and [14C]benzoate in accordance with the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and gave similar estimates of intracellular pH. As the extracellular pH declined, S. bovis allowed its intracellular pH to decrease and maintained a relatively constant pH gradient across the cell membrane (0.9 unit). The decrease in intracellular pH prevented S. bovis from accumulating large amounts of acetate anion. On the basis of these results it did not appear that acetate was acting as an uncoupler. The sensitivity of other bacteria to volatile fatty acids at low pH is explained most easily by a high transmembrane pH gradient and anion accumulation.
TI  - A rapid method for identification of Mycobacterium species by polyacrylamide gel  electrophoresis of soluble cell proteins.
AB  - The sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) profiles of an easily and rapidly prepared soluble protein fraction were used in conjunction with conventional techniques to identify different strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. bovis, M. bovis BCG, M. africanum, M. avium, M. kansasii, M. marinum, M. gastri, M. simiae and M. malmoense. Complete concordance of results from both methods was obtained with all species except those of the M. tuberculosis complex. With the SDS-PAGE technique, all strains of the M. tuberculosis complex were recognised as belonging to one species. By visual analysis of the SDS-PAGE polypeptide profiles, only minor differences between strains of the same species were seen and each species showed a characteristic polypeptide profile. Quantitation of the data by calculation of the Dice coefficient of similarity of the band positions obtained by densitometry indicated that the similarity between different strains of one species was 90-100% and the similarity between the species was in the range 30-45%. The results indicate that SDS-PAGE is a simple and rapid method for identifying mycobacterial strains.
TI  - A re-assessment of bacterial growth efficiency: the heat production and membrane  potential of Streptococcus bovis in batch and continuous culture.
AB  - Glucose-limited, continuous cultures (dilution rate 0.1 h-1) of Streptococcus bovis JB1 fermented glucose at a rate of 3.9 mumol mg protein-1 h-1 and produced acetate, formate and ethanol. Based on a maximum ATP yield of 32 cells/mol ATP (Stouthamer 1973) and 3 ATP/glucose, the theoretical glucose consumption for growth would have been 2.1 mumol mg protein-1 h-1. Because the maintenance energy requirement was 1.7 mumol/mg protein/h (Russell and Baldwin 1979), virtually all of the glucose consumption could be explained by growth and maintenance and the YATP was 30. Glucose-limited, continuous cultures produced heat at a rate of 0.29 mW/mg protein, and this value was similar to the enthalpy change of the fermentation (0.32 mW/mg protein). Batch cultures (specific growth rate 2.0 h-1) fermented glucose at a rate of 81 mumol mg protein-1 h-1, and produced only lactate. The heat production was in close agreement with the theoretical enthalpy change (1.72 versus 1.70 mW/mg protein), but only 80% of the glucose consumption could be accounted by growth and maintenance. The YATP of the batch cultures was 25. Nitrogen-limited, glucose-excess, non-growing cultures fermented glucose at a rate of 6.9 mumol mg protein-1 h-1, and virtually all of the enthalpy for this homolactic fermentation could be accounted as heat (0.17 mW/mg protein). The nitrogen-limited cultures had a membrane potential of 150 mV, and nearly all of the heat production could be explained by a futile cycle of protons through the cell membrane (watts = amperes X voltage where H+/ATP was 3).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Isolated tricuspid endocarditis. Apropos of a case caused by Streptococcus D bovis and faecalis occurring after coloscopy].
AB  - A 59-year-old chronic alcoholic male, with no cardiac past history, was hospitalised with septicemia 5 months after the endoscopic removal of 2 benign intestinal polyps. The diagnosis of tricuspid endocarditis was possible only 2 months later on the basis of echocardiography requested because of the onset of a tricuspid systolic murmur. Blood cultures revealed the presence in succession of streptococcus D fecalis then bovis. Antibiotics, changed several times because of the onset of complications (allergy, agranulocytosis), failed to deal with the problem of infection as shown by the development of several septic pulmonary emboli which finally resulted in total tricuspidectomy with neither immediate nor secondary valve replacement. The authors use this clinical case to review the characteristics of tricuspid endocarditis, the incidence of which is on the increase in certain etiological contexts (staphylococcal endocarditis in drug addicts or secondary to central vascular lines). They stress that the clinical picture is often confusing since the murmur of tricuspid incompetence is absent in 2/3 of cases. Echocardiography must therefore be requested routinely in all septicemias, thus enabling earlier diagnosis and assessment of the risk of pulmonary embolism (risk if vegetation greater than 10 mm). The nature of the organism responsible may be suggestive of certain etiologies. Thus malignant disease of the colon should be sought if the bacterium is a streptococcus D bovis. Apart from antibiotics, treatment must include effective anticoagulation to decrease the risk of embolic recurrence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - [Fever, somnolence, vomiting, diarrhea].
AB  - A 69-year-old female was admitted because of a febrile state, somnolence, nausea  and diarrhea. Addison's disease known to have developed several years earlier after adrenal tuberculosis suggested Addisonian crisis triggered by an acute infection. Therapy with steroids and substitution of electrolytes and fluid led to rapid improvement. Streptococcus bovis was identified as causative agent. The known association of this germ with cancer of the colon led to further investigation which revealed cancer of the sigmoid and incidental cancer of a salpinx. After surgical removal of both cancers, the patient has remained free of complaints under substitution of steroids.
TI  - Selective Medium for Enumeration of Tannin-Protein Complex-Degrading Streptococcus spp. in Feces of Koalas.
AB  - A selective agar plate medium (tannin-treated brain heart infusion agar supplemented with colistin-oxolinic acid) was developed to enumerate tannin-protein complex-degrading Streptococcus bovis in the feces of koalas. This medium was successfully used to enumerate strains from fecal samples but failed to enumerate those from pure cultures.
TI  - [Incidence and severity of cardiac involvement in Streptococcus bovis septicemia. Report of 10 cases].
AB  - Endocarditis due to the streptococcus Bovis is an affection which is more and more often recognized and whose link with the colic tumor pathology has been well established those last few years and confirmed in this study with a frequency of 60 p. cent. However, few studies have stated the gravity of the heart affection in streptococcus Bovis septicaemias. In this series of 10 streptococcus Bovis septicaemias, the valvular affection is frequent and serious. The vegetations are found in 9 cases out of 10. The aortic affection is slightly more frequent (8 times out of 10), against 7 times out of 10 for the mitral affection (double mitroaortic affection, 6 times). A valve replacement due to sub-acute or chronic cardiac failure was necessary in 6 cases out of 9, that is 66 p. cent. The mortality was nil.
TI  - Low-affinity, high-capacity system of glucose transport in the ruminal bacterium  Streptococcus bovis: evidence for a mechanism of facilitated diffusion.
AB  - The glucose phosphotransferase system (PTS) of Streptococcus bovis could not account for the glucose consumption of exponential cultures, and the kinetics of glucose transport were biphasic. A PTS-deficient mutant lost the high-affinity, low-capacity system but retained its ability to take up glucose at high substrate concentrations. The low-affinity, high-capacity system did not require a proton motive force or ATP and could not be driven by an artificial membrane potential in the presence or absence of sodium. Since low-affinity transport was directly proportional to the external substrate concentration and exhibited counterflow kinetics, it appeared that a facilitated-diffusion mechanism was responsible for glucose transport at high substrate concentrations.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis meningitis: report of 2 cases.
AB  - We describe 2 cases of Streptococcus bovis meningitis and review the 9 cases previously reported. This microorganism is a rare cause of meningitis in which there are no distinctive clinical or laboratory features. The Gram stain of the CSF is usually negative. Ten of the 11 cases had some underlying disease or comorbid condition that predisposed to S bovis infection: gastrointestinal disorder, endocarditis, CSF leak, polymyalgia rheumatica, and mandibular block. Treatment with high-dose penicillin is usually adequate.
TI  - Digestion of barley, maize, and wheat by selected species of ruminal bacteria.
AB  - Differences in the digestion of barley, maize, and wheat by three major ruminal starch-digesting bacterial species, Streptococcus bovis 26, Ruminobacter amylophilus 50, and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens A38, were characterized. The rate of starch digestion in all cereal species was greater for S. bovis 26 than for R. amylophilus 50 or B. fibrisolvens A38. Starch digestion by S. bovis 26 was greater in wheat than in barley or maize, whereas starch digestion by R. amylophilus 50 was greater in barley than in maize or wheat. B. fibrisolvens A38 digested the starch in barley and maize to a similar extent but was virtually unable to digest the starch in wheat. The higher ammonia concentration in cultures of B. fibrisolvens A38 when grown on wheat than when grown on barley or maize suggests that B. fibrisolvens A38 utilized wheat protein rather than starch. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that B. fibrisolvens A38 initially colonized cell wall material, while S. bovis 26 randomly colonized the endosperm and R. amylophilus 50 preferentially colonized starch granules. There was subsequent colonization but only superficial digestion of wheat starch granules by B. fibrisolvens A38. Variation in the association between starch and protein within the endosperm of cereal grains contributes to the differential effectiveness with which amylolytic species can utilize cereal starch.
TI  - [Detection of causative bacteria for bovine mastitis and their susceptibility to  beta-lactam antibacterial agents].
AB  - During the period from November 1988 to May 1989, causative bacteria in a total of 172 clinical mastitis cases observed in 66 farms in 5 districts with 6 areas in Japan were examined and frequencies of their occurrences were determined. Susceptibilities (in MICs) of the isolates to 6 beta-lactam antibacterial agents were also determined. As a result, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) was identified in 94 out of 172 cases (54.7%) and were the most prevalent. Corynebacterium spp., Gram-negative bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus were found in 52 (30.2%), 49 (28.5%) and 43 (25.0%) cases, respectively. Four species of Streptococcus family (S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae, S. uberis and S. bovis) were identified in a total of 58 cases (33.7%). Susceptibility testing of CNS to cefoperazone (CPZ), cefazolin (CEZ), benzylpenicillin (PCG), ampicillin (ABPC), methicillin (DMPPC) and cloxacillin (MCIPC) showed that all MIC80's (inhibiting bacterial growth of 80% of all isolates) were within a range from 0.10 to 3.13 micrograms/ml and that there was no marked differences in antibacterial effects among the antibiotics used. The highest antibacterial effect on S. aureus was exhibited by MCIPC, which inhibited the growth of all isolates at 0.39 microgram/ml. The MICs of DMPPC against all isolates of S. aureus were 3.13 micrograms/ml or less and no methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was detected. There was no difference in antibacterial activities against Streptococcus family between penicillin antibiotics (DMPPC, MCIPC, ABPC and PCG) and cephem antibiotics (CPZ and CEZ), both of which showed excellent antibacterial activities. Cephem antibiotics exhibited higher activities against Gram-negative bacteria than penicillin antibiotics. Especially CPZ, the third generation cephem, showed excellent antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., as well as against other Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Peptide and amino acid transport in Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - In amino acid transport studies with Streptococcus bovis using 14C-labelled amino acids, it has been shown that between 87% and 95% of cell-associated radioactivity was located in the cytosol. In similar studies with unlabelled peptides, most test peptide associated with S. bovis was truly intracellular. Using sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the proteolytic activity in S. bovis was found to be largely cell-associated and of the serine-protease type, but stimulated by dithiothreitol. A wide range of extracellular peptide hydrolysing activities was demonstrated against the pentapeptide Leu-Trp-Met-Arg-Phe, which was completely hydrolysed to eight products after 10 min incubation. Some of this pentapeptide was transported intact, indicating the existence of mechanisms for the transport of peptides up to 751 Da. In studies with Arg-Phe-Ala, only Phe (F) and Ala (A), and to a much lesser extent Phe-Ala (FA) were transported after extracellular hydrolysis to FA, Arg (R), F and A. In this case, amino acid transport was much more predominant than peptide transport. The extent and nature of peptide transport was affected by the addition of protease inhibitors.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin Bay  v 3522.
AB  - The activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. Bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to MICs of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. It was more active against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. Groups B, C and G streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the MI"90 for Streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. Clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most Bacteroides spp. were resistant. The MIC90 for beta-lactamase positive Escherichia coli (producing primarily TEM-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. The MIC90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for Haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. Bay v 3522 was destroyed by TEM-1, SHV-1, TEM-3 and P99 beta-lactamases.
TI  - Efficacy of chlorhexidine as a postmilking teat disinfectant for the prevention of bovine mastitis during lactation.
AB  - A natural exposure trial was conducted for 12 mo in a herd of 150 lactating Jersey cows to determine efficacy of a .35% chlorhexidine teat dip containing a glycerine emollient for the prevention of bovine intramammary infections. Right teats of cows were dipped in the experimental teat dip after milking machine removal and left teats were not dipped. The herd was free of Streptococcus agalactiae and had a low prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus. Most new major pathogen intramammary infections resulted from Streptococcus species, primarily Streptococcus uberis and Streptococcus dysgalactiae. New infections by Streptococcus species were significantly lower in teats dipped in chlorhexidine than in undipped teats. Overall efficacy of the chlorhexidine teat dip against major mastitis pathogens was 50%. The experimental teat dip also reduced coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species infections 49.0% and Corynebacterium bovis infections 65.2%. Overall efficacy against minor mastitis pathogens was 54.0%. No irritation or chapping of teats dipped in the experimental teat dip was observed.
TI  - [The suppression of delayed hypersensitivity to BCG antigens in BALB/c mice during the production of antibodies to the rhamnose determinants of Streptococcus group A polysaccharide].
AB  - The data obtained for the first time in our studies indicate that the production  of antibodies to group A streptococcal polysaccharide (A-PS), one of the cross-reacting streptococcal antigens, may suppress delayed hypersensitivity (DH) to microbial antigens. The existence of sharply pronounced correlation between the suppression of DH and the presence of antibodies to the rhamnose area of A-PS in the blood of BALB/c mice immunized with the pepsin-treated culture of group A streptococci has been shown. The suppression of DH is absent in the immunized animals of the same group whose blood contains antibodies to the determinant, specific for A-PS. As revealed in this study, the effect of the suppression of antigen-specific cytotoxicity linked with DH to BCG antigens can be reproduced by mixing lymph node cells taken from these two groups of the animals. The data thus obtained are possibly linked with the activation of nonspecific T suppressors in the production of antibodies to the rhamnose determinants of A-PS in the animals immunized with streptococci. The mechanism of the newly discovered phenomenon is discussed.

TI  - Streptococcus bovis infections in pigeons.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis infection was diagnosed in pigeons from 20 lofts submitted for post mortem investigation. Clinical signs were very variable and ranged from hyperacute death to chronic lameness with arthritis. Lesions were generally unspecific except for single cases of muscle necrosis with purulent myositis. Histological examinations demonstrated the septicaemic nature of the infections. Intravenous inoculations of S. bovis resulted in prostration, long lasting loss of weight and polyuria. Microscopically purulent hepatitis and nephritis were the most characteristic lesions. After oral inoculation no clinical signs were seen.
TI  - Characteristics of Streptococcus bovis associated with pigeons.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis strains isolated from different lesions in pigeons were found to differ from most S. bovis associated with mammals. S.bovis was only infrequently found in the gut and faeces of pigeons without streptococcal disease. The bacterium was also isolated from the crop and the pharynx of a minority of healthy pigeons.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis bacteraemia: its significance for the colorectal surgeon.
AB  - Patients with Streptococcus bovis bacteraemia are at high risk of harbouring an asymptomatic colorectal cancer or adenomatous polyps. It is therefore important to differentiate to a species level any Group D streptococci grown in blood cultures. Colonoscopy is the preferred method of screening these patients and high dose penicillin is the antibiotic of choice.
TI  - Effect of ionophores and pH on growth of Streptococcus bovis in batch and continuous culture.
AB  - Batch cultures (pH 6.7) of Streptococcus bovis JB1 were severely inhibited by 1.25 and 5 microM lasalocid and monensin, respectively, even though large amounts of glucose remained in the medium. However, continuous cultures tolerated as much as 10 and 20 microM, respectively, and used virtually all of the glucose. Although continuous cultures grew with high concentrations of ionophore, the yield of bacterial protein decreased approximately 10-fold. When pH was decreased from 6.7 to 5.7, the potency of both ionophores increased, but lasalocid always caused a larger decrease in yield. The increased activity of lasalocid at pH 5.7 could largely be explained by an increased binding of the ionophore to the cell membrane. Because monensin did not show an increased binding at low pH, some other factor (e.g., ion turnover) must have been influencing its activity. There was a linear increase in lasalocid binding as the concentration increased, but monensin binding increased markedly at high concentrations. Based on the observations that (i) S. bovis cells bound significant amounts of ionophore (the ratio of ionophore to cell material was more important than the absolute concentration), (ii) batch cultures responded differently from continuous cultures, and (iii) pH can have a marked effect on ionophore activity, it appears that the term "minimum inhibitory concentration" may not provide an accurate assessment of microbial growth inhibition in vivo.
TI  - The triad of Streptococcus bovis bacteremia, colonic pathology, and liver disease.
AB  - The association of Streptococcus bovis endocarditis and colon carcinoma has been  reported previously in small series in the medical, but not surgical, literature. Although the fecal carriage rate of S. bovis increases with colonic pathology, no explanation exists for the development of bacteremia in these cases. To explore the possible contribution of hepatic dysfunction to the development of portal and systemic bacteremia, the incidence of both colonic pathology and liver disease or dysfunction was determined in 92 patients with S. bovis endocarditis and/or bacteremia. Colonic and liver evaluation had been undertaken in 47% and 93% of patients, respectively. Among these patients, colonic pathology was identified in 51%, and liver disease or dysfunction was documented in 56%. Either the underlying colonic disease or alterations in hepatic secretion of bile salts or immunoglobulins may promote the overgrowth of S. bovis and its translocation from the intestinal lumen into the portal venous system. A compromised hepatic reticuloendothelial system may then contribute to the development of S. bovis septicemia and subsequent endocarditis. We conclude that S. bovis bacteremia is an indication to the clinician of the possibility of underlying liver disease as well as colon pathology.
TI  - Agalactosyl IgG, antibodies to heat shock proteins, and acute rheumatic fever.
AB  - In rheumatoid arthritis an increased proportion of the N-linked oligosaccharides  on serum IgG terminate with N-acetylglucosamine (agalactosyl IgG). It has recently been shown that group A streptococcal cell wall peptidoglycan/polysaccharide complex may be used to raise monoclonal antibodies which bind to this glycoform of IgG. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis also have increased levels of antibody to the 65 kD and 70 kD families of heat shock proteins, particularly to a bacterial (Mycobacterium bovis) homologue of heat shock protein hsp65. Streptococci must contain similar heat shock proteins. Acute rheumatic fever follows infection with group A streptococci, and these organisms might theoretically evoke antibody to heat shock proteins or changes in the levels of agalactosyl IgG, which is antigenically cross reactive with their cell walls. It is shown here that serum samples from patients with acute rheumatic fever do not differ from those from normal children by these criteria.
TI  - Protein G-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for anti-MPB70 antibodies in bovine tuberculosis.
AB  - MPB70 is a highly species specific protein which is secreted from Mycobacterium bovis during culture. To investigate whether antibodies against MPB70 can be used as an indicator of infection with M. bovis, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed, based on the use of biotinylated protein G, to provide a common indicator for antibody formation in different species. During experimental infection with M. bovis in cattle, a characteristic pattern of anti-MPB70 antibody production was observed with an initial flat plateau followed by a marked rise 18 to 20 weeks after infection. Skin testing with bovine tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD), which was shown to contain antibody-reactive MPB70, was a potent stimulator of antibody production in infected animals. In experimentally infected cattle, we observed an inverse relationship between antibody activity and delayed-type hypersensitivity skin test reactions. In natural M. bovis infections, skin testing with PPD was also a potent stimulator of anti-MPB70 formation. Comparison between the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies to MPB70 and that for antibodies to the widely cross-reacting M. bovis BCG antigen 85B in animals with M. bovis, Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium paratuberculosis, and Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis infections showed that formation of antibody to MPB70 was highly specific for infection with M. bovis. The use of an MPB70-containing PPD preparation for skin testing followed by this anti-MPB70 assay is a highly specific indicator of M. bovis infection. Adjustment of the test conditions is expected to provide an increased sensitivity of the procedure for the diagnosis of natural M. bovis infections.
TI  - The survival of streptococci and enterococci in animal feed and on straw with particular reference to Streptococcus uberis.
AB  - The survival of Streptococcus uberis, Strep. bovis, Enterococcus faecalis spp. faecalis and Ent. faecium in animal feed and on wheat straw was studied for one month. Streptococcus bovis survived the best in feed and Strep. uberis the worst while on straw Ent. faecium was the most resilient species and there was little to choose between the other three. The recovery of all species, excepting Strep. bovis, on selective and non-selective agar was comparable. The growth of Strep. bovis, on the other hand, was inhibited on both Edward's medium and inulin agar.
TI  - [Endocarditis caused by Streptococcus bovis and colorectal neoplasms].
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the association of Streptococcus bovis endocarditis with large bowel neoplasms. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Twenty episodes (19 patients) of Streptococcus bovis endocarditis (5.05%) selected from 396 episodes of endocarditis followed up from 1978 to 1990. The mean age was 57.68 years, 16 (84.21%) were males. Previous heart disease was not known in nine (45%). Previous manipulation that might induce bacteremia was identified in three patients. Symptoms related to neoplasia of the digestive system were not informed. The mean time of follow up (17 cases) was 33.76 months, standard deviation 27.37 months. Sixteen patients were submitted to colonic evaluation (barium enema in 11, colonoscopy in 5 patients, and both were performed in 5 patients). RESULTS: Bowel neoplasias were diagnosed in 12 (75%) of 16 patients submitted to colonic evaluation, one colonic adenocarcinoma in one (8.33%), patient, histologic benign polyps in eight (66.6%). Two patients are waiting for colonoscopic resection. In one patient the polyp was lost after colonoscopic resection. CONCLUSION: The high incidence of large bowel neoplasia in patients with Streptococcus bovis endocarditis indicates that evaluation of the large bowel must be performed on in patients with S. bovis endocarditis in order to diagnose neoplasias, even in the absence of symptoms of bowel disease.
TI  - Formation of a clear zone on tannin-treated brain heart infusion agar by a Streptococcus sp. isolated from feces of koalas.
AB  - Gram-positive cocci, isolated from the feces of koalas and identified as Streptococcus bovis biotype I, formed a distinct clear zone on tannin-treated brain heart infusion agar, suggesting that this isolate has the unique characteristic of degrading the tannin-protein complex.
TI  - Vancomycin-aminoglycoside combinations in therapy of endocarditis caused by Enterococcus species and Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - Between 1974 and 1986, five patients with enterococcal endocarditis (three of whom had a prosthetic valve) and three patients with Streptococcus bovis endocarditis were treated with a combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside for a mean duration of 40 days. This regimen was prescribed because of allergy to beta-lactam (n = 7) and/or failure of previous treatment (n = 4). Three of the eight patients underwent valve replacement. In the six evaluable patients cure was achieved with the vancomycin-aminoglycoside combination. An increase of the creatinine serum levels was observed in all cases but it was never necessary to discontinue treatment, adjustment of the vancomycin and aminoglycoside dosage according to the serum and/or serum creatinine levels allowing continuation of therapy.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis brain abscess associated with an occult colonic villous adenoma.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis is now recognized as a common cause of bacterial endocarditis. However, infection of the central nervous system by this organism is very rare. Recent studies have demonstrated the association between Streptococcus bovis infections and colonic neoplasms.
TI  - In vivo dental plaque-forming ability and cariogenicity of the bacterium Streptococcus bovis in gnotobiotic rats.
AB  - Germ-free Fisher rats, fed on a high sucrose diet, were monoinfected with Streptococcus bovis strains. High levels of fissure caries were formed by three strains; one strain produced moderate levels; another produced only very low levels. No strain could produce approximal or buccal/lingual lesions. All strains could colonize the fissures of teeth in the lower jaw, as shown by scanning electron microscopy. The most cariogenic strains were associated with caries scores similar to those of Strep. salivarius and members of the mutants streptococci.
TI  - Streptococci from the bovine udder in dairy herds in Khartoum Province, Sudan.
AB  - Five hundred and seventy-nine milk samples were collected from dairy cows on seven farms in Khartoum North area and one farm in Omdurman and examined by bacteriological cultures for the presence of streptococci. One hundred and ninety-three (33.33%) isolates were recovered and identified on the basis of bacteriological characteristics and biochemical reactions as: S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae, S. faecalis, S. faecium, S. bovis, S. equi, S. lactis and S. uberis. Fifty-seven isolates representing the preliminary identification were tested by the latex-agglutination test to determine the serological groups. It was found that 39 strains belonged to group B, 3 strains to group C. Four strains gave a weak reaction with group D sera and were identified by biochemical tests as S. uberis. Two isolates could not be identified by the available sera. The isolation of S. uberis, S. bovis, S. equi, S. lactis, S. faecalis, S. faecium and S. pyogenes from cows in the Sudan was reported for the first time.
TI  - ATPase-dependent energy spilling by the ruminal bacterium, Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - When the ruminal bacterium Streptococcus bovis was grown in batch culture with glucose as the energy source, the doubling time was approximately 21 min and the rate of bacterial heat production was proportional to the optical density (1.72 microW/micrograms protein). If exponentially growing cultures were treated with chloramphenicol, there was a decline in heat production, but the rate was greater than 0.30 microW/micrograms protein even after growth ceased. Since there was no heat production after glucose depletion, this growth-independent energy dissipation (spilling) was not simply due to endogenous metabolism. Stationary cells which were washed and incubated in nitrogen-free medium containing an excess of glucose produced heat at a rate of 0.17 microW/micrograms protein. Monensin and tetrachlorosalicylanilide (TCS), compounds which facilitate an influx of protons, caused a more than 2-fold increase in heat production. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) virtually eliminated growth-independent heat production regardless of the mode of growth inhibition. Because DCCD had little effect on the glucose phosphotransferase system, it appeared that the combined action of proton influx and the membrane bound F1F0 proton ATPase was responsible for energy spilling.
TI  - [Community- and hospital-acquired bacteremia: a retrospective study in a regional hospital. III. Microbiological aspects].
AB  - A retrospective study was made of all blood cultures performed over a 40-month period at the Ivrea-Castellamonte Hospital (Turin, Italy). A total of 4386 vials from 619 patients were examined. There were 619 positive vials (14.1%) from 131 patients (21.2%) corresponding to 145 bacteremia episodes, including 129 monomicrobial (89%) and 16 polymicrobial (11%). Ten patients (1.6%) had more than one episode. There were 73 polluted vials (1.7%). A total of 165 microorganism were isolated: Gram-positive (52.7%) and Gram-negative (46%) bacteria, and mycetes (1.2%), anaerobic flora (9.7%). The predominant families were: Enterobacteriaceae (29.5%), Micrococcaceae (27.3%), Pseudomonadaceae (4.8%), Bacteroidaceae (4.8%) and Streptococcus "Genus" (18.8%). The species frequencies were: Escherichia coli (20%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.8%), Enterococcus (8.5%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.8%), Proteus mirabilis (4.2%), Brucella spp. (2.4%), Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus bovis e Propionibacterium acnes (1.8%). These findings are compared with those published in the Italian and international literature. Stress is laid on periodical review of the isolations from samples of this kind as a useful aid towards the diagnosis and treatment of hospital infections, and in their monitoring and epidemiological evaluation.
TI  - [Infected false aneurysm at the level of an aortotomy cicatrix 5 years after mechanical replacement of the aortic valve].
AB  - The authors report the case of Streptococcus Bovis Infection of a pseudoaneurysm  which developed in the aortotomy suture line five years after aortic valve replacement with a Bjork-Shiley prosthesis. This was an isolated lesion without involvement of the prosthesis or aortic ring and was an operative finding.
TI  - [Milk chloride level as an indicator of bovine mastitis].
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine an influence of udder infection on milk chloride level and on milk productivity of cows of black and white race. Bacteriological analysis was performed by bacterial isolation from milk collected in sterile conditions from single lobes of mammary gland. The study was aimed to detect the following bacteria: Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Actinomyces pyogenes, Enterobacteriaceae rods, Corynebacterium bovis, and Micrococcus sp. Milk chloride level was determined by burette method in 1250 milk samples collected from entire udder. Milk productivity was determined on the day of bacterial isolation. Statistical analysis of the results of the study on udder infection, milk chloride level, and milk productivity of mammary gland did reveal lack of a simple correlations between those parameters and in the indirect manner indicated an influence of inappropriate maintenance conditions of tested cows on the health condition of their udder. It seems possible that alkalosis and acidosis in cows, taken into consideration in discussion section, could constitute a factor influencing the frequency of mastitis incidence.
TI  - Factors influencing the adherence of strains of Streptococcus bovis and Escherichia coli isolated from ruminal epithelium.
AB  - Two strains of Streptococcus bovis (A1 and A5) and one strain of Escherichia coli (0141:H28) isolated from the surface of bovine ruminal mucous epithelium were examined for adherence to isolated and cultured ruminal epithelial cells. The E. coli adhered to the target cell by means of fimbriae, which had several common properties with type 1 common fimbriae and caused mannose-sensitive haemagglutination. The A1 strain of S. bovis was devoid of fimbriae and its adherence to the epithelial surface was not inhibited by treatment with sugars or phenol-treated bacterial membrane from the same organism. It was therefore postulated that the bacterial glycocalyx of the S. bovis organisms acted as ligand. The extent of bacterial adherence depended on the state of differentiation of the target cell in both the isolated and the cultured ruminal cell systems. The receptors for both adherent bacterial species were in all probability associated with the glycocalyx of the target cells.
TI  - Electrophoretic analysis of ureases in Streptococcus salivarius and in saliva.
AB  - Experimental conditions were established for the extraction, electrophoresis and  detection of urease isoenzymes from Streptococcus salivarius. Thiol concentrations were critical and ureases from different strains varied in ease of dissociation. A characteristic pattern was obtained for 30 ureolytic S. salivarius strains isolated from; saliva (6), dental plaque (12), artificial dental plaque (6) and non-oral sources (6), and also for a ureolytic Streptococcus bovis from artificial plaque. One non-oral S. salivarius strain had ureases with slightly slower mobility. The electrophoretic pattern and mobility of ureases extracted from human mixed salivary bacteria were identical to those from S. salivarius except for an additional set of urease bands from unknown species of bacteria. There were no ureases from saliva matching those from Staphylococcus epidermidis--a contributor to ureolysis in artificial plaque. We conclude that there is considerable biochemical homogeneity among S. salivarius ureases and possibly other ureolytic streptococci. In saliva, urea is metabolized mainly by streptococcal ureases.
TI  - Properties of a phosphocarrier protein (HPr) extracted from intact cells of Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - Cells of Streptococcus sanguis strain Challis were incubated with sodium lauroylsarcosinate to extract surface proteins. A polypeptide of apparent molecular mass 16 kDa comprising about 12% of the extract was purified using anion-exchange chromatography. The polypeptide was shown to be a phosphocarrier protein (HPr) that could also be found in the soluble (cytoplasmic) fraction from cells broken by homogenization with glass beads. In vivo labelling of S. sanguis cells with 32Pi showed that the polypeptide carried a heat- and acid-stable phosphorylation and that during sucrose starvation the HPr became dephosphorylated. Antiserum raised to the S. sanguis HPr reacted on Western blots with HPrs from all oral streptococci tested, together with strains of S. pyogenes and S. salivarius, but not with HPrs from S. faecalis or S. bovis, nor with proteins from Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Actinomyces viscosus and various lactobacilli. The S. sanguis HPr had a high content of alanine (17.2%) and was similar in overall amino acid composition to the HPrs from S. mutans an S. salivarius. The N-terminal residues (to 37) of the S. sanguis HPr showed strong sequence identity (82%) with the N-terminal sequence of S. faecalis HPr. It is suggested that HPr in S. sanguis is associated closely with the cytoplasmic membrane. Non-disruptive methods of removing cell-surface proteins from streptococci effect release of HPr and possibly other cytoplasmic components.
TI  - Nisin inhibits several gram-positive, mastitis-causing pathogens.
AB  - Organisms known to cause bovine mastitis, Enterococcus faecalis ssp. liquefaciens ATCC 27959, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29740, Streptococcus agalactiae ATCC 27956, Streptococcus equinus ATCC 27960, Streptococcus dysgalactiae ATCC 27957, Streptococcus uberis ATCC 27958, and the neotype Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990 were examined for their susceptibility to the small peptide antibiotic, nisin. Using a disc assay, minimum inhibitory concentrations of nisin ranged from 10 to 250 micrograms/ml among the strains. Examination of the antimicrobial effect of 50 micrograms/ml nisin in milk showed nisin inhibited all gram-positive pathogens tested.
TI  - Prevention of bovine mastitis by a postmilking teat disinfectant containing chlorous acid and chlorine dioxide in a soluble polymer gel.
AB  - A natural exposure study was conducted in a herd of 150 lactating dairy cows for  18 mo to determine the effectiveness of chlorous acid and chlorine dioxide in a soluble polymer gel as a postmilking teat disinfectant for the prevention of bovine mastitis. Right quarters of cows were dipped in the experimental teat dip after milking machine removal. Left quarters were not dipped and served as within-cow negative controls. The experimental teat dip reduced Staphylococcus aureus infections 67.4%, Streptococcus dysgalactiae infections 63.8%, and Streptococcus uberis infections 27.8%. Overall efficacy of the chlorous acid and chlorine dioxide teat dip against major mastitis pathogens was 52.2%. The experimental teat dip reduced Corynebacterium bovis infections and coagulase-negative staphylococcal infections also by 45.8 and 38.7%, respectively. Overall efficacy against minor mastitis pathogens was 43.4%. Under conditions of this trial, the experimental teat dip containing chlorous acid and chlorine dioxide was effective in preventing new intramammary infections against a variety of mastitis pathogens.
TI  - Diagnosing endocarditis with the cloned 112 kDa antigen of Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - A new indirect ELISA is presented for the diagnosis of enterococcal endocarditis. It is based on the cloning of Enterococcus faecalis DNA into lambda gt11. The library was screened by antisera from three cases of E. faecalis endocarditis. Three positive clones were found, all of which cross-reacted with the 112 kDa antigen of E. faecalis. One of these was taken and lysogenised into E. coli Y1089 to produce a fusion protein of 125 kDa. This IPTG dependent protein was purified by affinity chromatography and used in an indirect ELISA. The test differentiated between five cases of enterococcal endocarditis (IgG ELISA optical density greater than 0.8) and patients with endocarditis due to staphylococci (IgG ELISA optical density less than 0.243) and other streptococci (IgG ELISA optical density less than 0.656). Patients with a simple E. faecalis septicaemia had a maximum IgG ELISA optical density of 0.636. The only major cross-reaction occurred in patients with Streptococcus bovis endocarditis.
TI  - Intramammary infections and risk factors for clinical mastitis in herds with low  somatic cell counts in bulk milk.
AB  - Ten herds with low somatic cell counts in bulk milk had an incidence of clinical  mastitis of only 2.2 per 100 cows whereas 10 other herds with similarly low cell counts had an incidence of 53.6 per 100 cows. The major pathogens in the herds with a high incidence were Escherichia coli, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus and the coagulase-negative staphylococci. The percentage of uninfected quarters in the herds with a high incidence of clinical mastitis was 21.4 per cent compared with 12.2 per cent in the herds with a low incidence of clinical mastitis. The prevalence of coagulase-negative staphylococci, Corynebacterium bovis and Micrococcus species was higher in the herds with a low incidence of clinical mastitis. There was a significant linear relationship between the percentage of uninfected quarters and the incidence of clinical mastitis in the herds with a high incidence of clinical mastitis. In herds with a low incidence of clinical mastitis significantly less teat disinfection after milking was practised. The results suggest that infections with minor pathogens tend to protect cows against mastitis, and that teat disinfection after milking may increase the percentage of uninfected quarters and lead to an increased risk of clinical mastitis in herds with low somatic cell counts in bulk milk.
TI  - Evaluation of the Rapid Strep system for identification of gram-positive, catalase-negative cocci isolated from bovine intramammary infections.
AB  - The Rapid Strep system (Analytab Products, Plainview, NY) was used to identify 199 gram-positive, catalase-negative cocci isolated from bovine intramammary infections. The system accurately identified 88.4% of isolates. The system identified 100% of 46 Streptococcus agalactiae, 100% of 48 Streptococcus dysgalactiae, 54.5% of 11 Streptococcus equinus, and 96.2% of 53 Streptococcus uberis isolates. Enterococcus spp. were identified correctly 83.3% of the time. One of 4 Streptococcus saccharolyticus strains was identified as Streptococcus bovis, the previous classification for this organism, and 8 Streptococcus equi ssp. equi strains were misidentified as Streptococcus dysgalactiae. The Rapid Strep system was determined to be an acceptable alternative to conventional methods for identification of gram-positive, catalase-negative cocci isolated from bovine intramammary infections.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of two rumen Streptococcus bovis bacteriophages.
AB  - A method for the isolation of Streptococcus bovis bacteriophages from ruminal fluid of calves is described. Thirty to 2 x 10(3) phages per ml infecting Streptococcus bovis strains 4/1 and 47/3 were isolated directly from ruminal fluid. Two bacteriophages were characterized on the basis of plaque morphology, host ranges, electron microscopic morphology and DNA restriction endonuclease digestion patterns. The F1 and F3 phages formed clear plaques of different sizes. The plaque size of the F1 phage was about 1-1.5 mm in diameter, while the plaques of the F3 phage were larger (1.5-2.5 mm in diameter). Both phages are placed in group B of Bradley's scheme and have different host ranges. The first isolation of Streptococcus bovis phage DNA is reported. Restriction analysis of their DNAs showed that phages F1 and F3 had different numbers of cleavage sites in their genomes and that they were not identical.
TI  - The faecal flora of the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca).
AB  - The faecal floras of two adult (male and female) and one infant (male) giant panda kept at the Ueno Zoo, Tokyo, Japan were examined and shown to be quite different from those of other animals. The predominant bacteria in the adults were Streptococcus (including Enterococcus) and Enterobacteriaceae, while obligate anaerobes had minor populations. Fastidious anaerobes were not detected. The predominant bacteria in the suckling infant were Lactobacillus and Streptococcus, followed by Bifidobacterium. After the infant began to eat bamboo leaves the number of Lactobacillus decreased and Bifidobacterium became undetectable, whereas Enterobacteriaceae became one of the most predominant flora. The most dominant streptococcus isolated from the female panda was identified as Streptococcus bovis, but those from the male adult and the weaned infant were not identified as any known species.
TI  - Non-proton-motive-force-dependent sodium efflux from the ruminal bacterium Streptococcus bovis: bound versus free pools.
AB  - Growing cells of Streptococcus bovis JB1 had a sodium content of 1,125 nmol/mg of protein and, based on a ratio of cell volume to protein of 4.3 microliters/mg, the apparent intracellular sodium concentration was more than 240 mM. Much of this sodium could not be removed by water washing even if cells were boiled or treated with the pore-forming ionophore, gramicidin, but it could be exchanged for potassium. Stationary cultures had a 2.6-microliters volume per milligram of protein and a total sodium content of 410 mM. When stationary cultures were energized with glucose at pH 6 to 8, sodium (more than 200 mM) was expelled within 2 min, and it appeared that growing cells had a very small pool of free intracellular sodium. Sodium-proton antiport activity could not be demonstrated with a sodium pulse, and the protonophore SF6847, valinomycin, and the H+-ATPase inhibitor dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) had little effect on sodium efflux, even though these inhibitors greatly reduced the proton-motive force. SF6847, valinomycin, and DCCD had little effect on intracellular ATP, but iodoacetate, an inhibitor of glycolysis, decreased ATP as well as sodium efflux. Stationary cells from sodium-deficient medium expelled little sodium after glucose addition and had 35% more ATP than stationary cells which were grown in sodium medium and expelled sodium. An artificial electrochemical gradient of sodium was able to drive ATP synthesis in stationary cells, and this ATP formation was not sensitive to DCCD. These results indicated that bacteria could have a significant pool of bound sodium and that sodium expulsion from S. bovis was directly coupled to ATP hydrolysis.
TI  - Rapid identification of Streptococcus bovis by using combination constitutive enzyme substrate hydrolyses.
AB  - Several studies have documented the association of blood and rectal-culture positivity for Streptococcus bovis with gastrointestinal neoplasia, especially colonic carcinoma. Conventional methods using bile-esculin hydrolysis, salt tolerance, and sugar fermentations to differentiate S. bovis from other streptococci are laborious, slow, and relatively expensive. Commercially available systems are costly and require at least 24 to 48 h of incubation. A rapid identification procedure for S. bovis and related bacteria was developed. The method uses a reagent containing two hydrolyzable substrates, p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-galactopyranoside and 4-methylumbilliferyl-beta-D-glucoside, in the presence of 2.5% sodium deoxycholate. This combination test, performed with a rapid assay for L-pyrrolidonyl-aminopeptidase, could distinguish S. bovis, Streptococcus equinus, Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the viridans group streptococci in culture within 30 min. Twelve species of the genera Streptococcus and Enterococcus were tested. The rapid method correlated well with conventional techniques. The reagents are readily available, inexpensive, and easy to make and can be stored in the refrigerator for at least 6 months.
TI  - Classification and identification of the viridans streptococci.
AB  - This review traces the history of the human, nonhemolytic, or viridans, streptococci and describes improvements in their taxonomy wrought by study of their biochemical profiles and analysis of their nucleic acids. The goal was to define species on the basis of genetic relationships and to describe these species by their phenotypic characteristics so that they can be easily identified. This method has resulted in the division of some species. Streptococcus mutans has been divided into four species, two of which are common in humans. Three more mutans group species are indigenous to animals. Conversely, S. constellatus, S. intermedius, and "S. milleri" have been combined under S. anginosus. S. mitis (or "S. mitior") can be well-defined and includes S. sanguis II. There is genetic heterogeneity within S. sanguis, but the species is usually easy to identify. There is also some heterogeneity in S. bovis, but most human isolates are genetically related. Discussions of the taxonomy of these species are accompanied by descriptions of the characteristics by which these streptococci can be identified. Among these species are potential pathogens which should be suspected in cases of endocarditis and purulent infections of liver, brain, and other tissues.

TI  - Aerococcus-like organism--an unnoticed urinary tract pathogen.
AB  - Aerococci are only occasionally isolated from urinary tract specimens. A 4-month' survey revealed 29 patients suspected of urinary tract infection (UTI), from whom an Aerococcus-like organism (ALO) was isolated in significant numbers from urinary tract specimens and singly in 11 cases. Approximately 0.8% of all urinary tract specimens examined during the period yielded growth of ALO. The median age of patients was 75 years. Half of the patients were found to have conditions predisposing to UTI. 9 of 11 patients without indwelling catheter, having ALO isolated in pure culture from the urine, showed one or more typical signs of UTI (fever, dysuria and/or pollakisuria and pyuria). A phenotypic comparison was made between 29 strains of ALO and 6 related organisms, including Aerococcus viridans, Streptococcus faecium, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus Group Q and Streptococcus Group R. ALO and A. viridans showed many similarities, but, owing to characteristic differences with regard to colony morphology, biochemical reactions and antibiotic susceptibility pattern, the strains were easily separated.
TI  - Transport of glutamine by Streptococcus bovis and conversion of glutamine to pyroglutamic acid and ammonia.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis JB1 cells energized with glucose transported glutamine at a rate of 7 nmol/mg of protein per min at a pH of 5.0 to 7.5; sodium had little effect on the transport rate. Because valinomycin-treated cells loaded with K and diluted into Na (pH 6.5) to create an artificial delta psi took up little glutamine, it appeared that transport was driven by phosphate-bond energy rather than proton motive force. The kinetics of glutamine transport by glucose-energized cells were biphasic, and it appeared that facilitated diffusion was also involved, particularly at high glutamine concentrations. Glucose-depleted cultures took up glutamine and produced ammonia, but the rate of transport per unit of glutamine (V/S) by nonenergized cells was at least 1,000-fold less than the V/S by glucose-energized cells. Glutamine was converted to pyroglutamate and ammonia by a pathway that did not involve a glutaminase reaction or glutamate production. No ammonia production from pyroglutamate was detected. S. bovis was unable to take up glutamate, but intracellular glutamate concentrations were as high as 7 mM. Glutamate was produced from ammonia via a glutamate dehydrogenase reaction. Cells contained high concentrations of 2-oxoglutarate and NADPH that inhibited glutamate deamination and favored glutamate formation. Since the carbon skeleton of glutamine was lost as pyroglutamate, glutamate formation occurred at the expense of glucose. Arginine deamination is often used as a taxonomic tool in classifying streptococci, and it had generally been assumed that other amino acids could not be fermented. To our knowledge, this is the first report of glutamine conversion to pyroglutamate and ammonia in streptococci.
TI  - Evaluation of teicoplanin for treatment of endocarditis caused by gram-positive cocci in 20 patients.
AB  - Teicoplanin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic similar to vancomycin, was evaluated for the treatment of bacterial endocarditis in an open multicenter study from May 1985 to August 1987. A total of 20 patients with positive blood culture endocarditis received teicoplanin once daily as a mean intravenous injection of 7.3 mg/kg of body weight (range, 4.8 to 10.6 mg/kg); in 17 patients, teicoplanin was combined with another antibiotic, usually an aminoglycoside. The mean duration of therapy was 28 days (range, 7 to 66 days). The diagnosis of endocarditis was confirmed by echocardiography or anatomical findings in 15 patients and established on the basis of clinical manifestations plus positive blood cultures in 5 patients. The tricuspid valve was involved in 11 of the 20 patients. Isolates from blood were 12 Staphylococcus aureus, 1 Staphylococcus hominis, 1 Micrococcus sedentarius, 1 Enterococcus faecalis, 3 Streptococcus bovis, and 2 nongroupable Streptococcus sp. At the end of therapy, bacterial eradication was achieved in 17 of 20 patients (85%), and a favorable clinical outcome had occurred in 14 of 17 evaluable patients (82%). Of these 14 patients, one relapsed 4 months after the end of treatment. Thus, teicoplanin was effective in 13 of 17 patients (76%). Mean peak levels of teicoplanin in serum were lower, 23.1 +/- 2.9 micrograms/ml, in patients who failed than in those who were cured (45.8 +/- 8.4 micrograms/ml). Side effects occurred in 7 of 20 patients (35%), and required premature discontinuation of teicoplanin in 3 patients. These side effects were fever in three patients, rash in three patients, hearing loss in two patients, and increased serum transaminase levels in two patients. This study demonstrates the efficacy of teicoplanin in the treatment of endocarditis and the need for achieving peak levels in serum close to 40 micrograms/ml. Teicoplanin should now be further evaluated in endocarditis caused by gram-positive cocci means of controlled comparative study with standard therapy.
TI  - More monensin-sensitive, ammonia-producing bacteria from the rumen.
AB  - Two monensin-sensitive bacteria which utilized carbohydrates poorly and grew rapidly on amino acids were isolated from the bovine rumen. The short rods (strain SR) fermented arginine, serine, lysine, glutamine, and threonine rapidly (greater than 158 nmol/mg of protein per h) and grew faster on casein digest containing short peptides than on free amino acids ().34 versus 0.29 h(-1)). Gelatin hydrolysate, an amino acid source containing an abundance of long peptides, was unable to support growth or ammonia production, but there was a large increase in ammonia production if strain SR was cocultured with peptidase-producing ruminal bacteria (Bacteroides ruminicola or Streptococcus bovis). Cocultures showed no synergism with short peptides. Strain SR washed out of continuous culture ().1 h(-1)) at pH 5.9. The irregularly shaped organisms (strain F) deaminated glutamine, histidine, glutamate, and serine rapidly (greater than 137 nmol/mg of protein per min) and grew faster on free amino acids than on short peptides ().43 versus 0.21 h(-1)). When strain F was provided with casein or gelatin hydrolysate and cocultured with peptidase-producing bacteria, there was a more than additive increase in ammonia production. Strain F grew in continuous culture (0.1 h(-1)) when the pH was as low as 5.3. The irregularly shaped cells and short rods were present at less than 10(9)/ml in vivo, but they ahd very high specific activities of ammonia production (greater than 310 nmol of ammonia/mg of protein per min) and could play an important role in ruminal amino acid fermentation.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis septicemia and large bowel neoplasia.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis septicemia is a relatively uncommon entity that is associated with an increased incidence of colonic neoplasms. Three of four patients with S. bovis endocarditis subsequent to septicemia underwent colonoscopy. The fourth patient underwent a barium enema and a proctoscopic examination. Polyps were found in three patients, and adenocarcinoma of the colon in one. Patients with S. bovis endocarditis should be considered at high risk for colonic neoplasms. Screening colonoscopy is recommended for these patients, and follow-up colonoscopy may be warranted.
TI  - A physiological classification of viridans streptococci by use of the API-20STREP system.
AB  - Physiological reactions of viridans streptococci were examined by the API-20STREP system and a selection of conventional tests. Cluster analysis of these results produced a classification similar to a taxonomic scheme based on that of Colman and Williams. The organisms could be divided into the six recognised species--Streptococcus mutans, S. bovis, S. mitior, S. sanguis, S. salivarius and S. milleri. Analysis confirmed that S. mitior and S. sanguis can be distinguished in the API-20STREP test by hydrolysis of arginine but not by dextran production. Although S. mutans, S. mitior and S. sanguis can be divided into two further subgroups, the taxonomic significance of this is unclear. With this means of classification, most organisms could be identified easily by a small number of tests. API-20STREP is convenient for performing physiological tests on viridans streptococci, but the information provided by the manufacturers in regard to identification and nomenclature is in need of revision.

TI  - Bacteremia with Streptococcus bovis and Streptococcus salivarius: clinical correlates of more accurate identification of isolates.
AB  - Two biotypes of Streptococcus bovis can be identified by laboratory testing and can be distinguished from the phenotypically similar organism Streptococcus salivarius. We assessed the clinical relevance of careful identification of these organisms in 68 patients with streptococcal bacteremia caused by these similar species. S. bovis was more likely to be clinically significant when isolated from blood (89%) than was S. salivarius (23%). There was a striking association between S. bovis I bacteremia and underlying endocarditis (94%) compared with that of S. bovis II bacteremia (18%). Bacteremia with S. bovis I was also highly correlated with an underlying colonic neoplasm (71% of patients overall, 100% of those with thorough colonic examinations) compared with bacteremia due to S. bovis II or S. salivarius (17% overall, 25% of patients with thorough colonic examinations). We conclude that careful identification of streptococcal bacteremic isolates as S. bovis biotype I provides clinically important information and should be more widely applied.
TI  - DNA probe for identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - A total of 287 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) were  tested for their ability to undergo autolysis when treated with sodium deoxycholate. The test was positive for all but one isolate, strain DOC-1. This autolysis required the activity of an enzyme which is unique and characteristic of S. pneumoniae: a choline-dependent N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase, the gene product of the lytA gene. We used lytA as a DNA probe to test the distribution of the autolysin gene among clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae. In dot blot hybridization experiments our probe reacted with the DNA of 60 of 60 strains tested, including the autolysis-deficient clinical isolate DOC-1. No hybridization occurred when strains of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis, Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus bovis were tested. The lytA gene appears to be an ideal candidate for use as a DNA probe for the identification of S. pneumoniae.

Human faecal streptococci were predominant, and animal faecal streptococci were also detected. Eight species and varieties were identified, viz Streptococcus faecalis, atypical Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus equinus, Streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens, Streptococcus faecalis var. zymogenes, Streptococcus durans and Streptococcus faecium. The incidence of these species and varieties were 43.32%, 13.18%, 11.47%, 11.30%, 9.76%, 5.30%, 3.76% and 1.88%, respectively.
TI  - Lasalocid-catalyzed proton conductance in Streptococcus bovis as affected by extracellular potassium.
AB  - The effect of extracellular potassium on lasalocid-catalyzed proton conductance in Streptococcus bovis 24 was measured by using the fluorescent probe 9-aminoacridine. Increasing external potassium concentration resulted in decreased proton flux into S. bovis cells exposed to the ionophore. These results suggest that lasalocid catalyzes K+/H+ exchange diffusion in S. bovis cells.
TI  - [Streptococcus bovis septicemia and colonic cancer].
AB  - The authors report the case of a patient who developed a Streptococcus Bovis septicemia in the post-operative course of a surgical cure of an incarcerated umbilical hernia. There were no other complaints. A barium enema showed a malignant tumor of the descending colon. There were hepatic metastases. No complementary treatment was undertaken. The patient died shortly after. In the literature colonic proliferative lesions in association with this germ is reported in a total of 36% of proliferative lesions (15% of cancers and 21% of adenomas). It is concluded that the discovery of a malignant or premalignant proliferative lesion in one third of the cases justifies the exploration of the colon by barium enema and/or colonoscopy in the case of Streptococcus Bovis septicemia. The discovery of other digestive lesions (malignant or not) seems to be coincidental.
TI  - Effects of the ionophores monensin and tetronasin on simulated development of ruminal lactic acidosis in vitro.
AB  - A continuous coculture of four ruminal bacteria, Megasphaera elsdenii, Selenomonas ruminantium, Streptococcus bovis, and Lactobacillus sp. strain LB17, was used to study the effects of the ionophores monensin and tetronasin on the changes in ruminal microbial ecology that occur during the onset of lactic acidosis. In control incubations, the system simulated the development of lactic acidosis in vivo, with an initial overgrowth of S. bovis when an excess of glucose was added to the fermentor. Lactobacillus sp. strain LB17 subsequently became dominant as pH fell and lactate concentration rose. Both ionophores were able to prevent the accumulation of lactic acid and maintain a healthy non-lactate-producing bacterial population when added at the same time as an excess of glucose. Tetronasin was more potent in this respect than monensin. When tetronasin was added to the culture 24 h after glucose, the proliferation of lactobacilli was reversed and a non-lactate-producing bacterial population developed, with an associated drop in lactate concentration in the fermentor. Rises in culture pH and volatile fatty acid concentrations accompanied these changes. Monensin was unable to suppress the growth of lactobacilli; therefore, in contrast to tetronasin, monensin added 24 h after the addition of glucose failed to reverse the acidosis. Numbers of lactobacilli and lactate concentrations remained high, whereas pH and volatile fatty acid concentrations were low.
TI  - Two-stage reimplantation in infected total knee arthroplasty.
AB  - Twenty-one infected total knee arthroplasties (TKA) in 21 patients were treated from September 1980 through October 1987. Of these, 15 were followed for more than one year. Treatment of these patients consisted of thorough debridement of all infected tissue and components; a cement spacer was used in ten patients. The cement was impregnated with antibiotics. This procedure was followed for an average of 4.2 weeks with intravenous antibiotics and TKA utilizing antibiotic-impregnated cement. Five patients had rheumatoid arthritis and ten had osteoarthritis. The organisms included Staphylococcus coagulase negative (seven patients), Streptococcus group B (two patients), Streptococcus bovis (one patient), Enterococcus (one patient), Staphylococcus coagulase positive and Bacillus circulans (one patient), Staphylococcus coagulase negative and Enterococcus (one patient), Staphylococcus coagulase negative and Pseudomonas aeuriginosa (one patient), and Clostridium perfringens (one patient). Of the 15 patients, 12 appeared to be free of infection, two were obvious failures and required knee fusion, and one was suspected of having continued infection at five years and was treated elsewhere. Eleven patients with revision TKA were available for follow-up examinations at an average of 2.9 years (range, one to six years). One patient died five years after reimplantation but had been functioning well. One patient functioning at three years postreimplantation did not return for a later follow-up examination. The average knee score (modification of the Hospital for Special Surgery Knee Score) was 75.5 points (range, 48-94); average flexion was 81 degrees (range, 52 degrees-120 degrees), and average extension was +6 degrees (range, 0 degrees-30 degrees).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Frequency of isolation of environmental mastitis-causing pathogens and incidence  of new intramammary infection during the nonlactating period.
AB  - Quarter samples (n = 6,328) of mammary secretions were collected from 160 cows during physiologic transitions of the udder to determine the frequency of isolation of mastitis-causing pathogens and the incidence of new intramammary infections (IMI) during the nonlactating period. None of the cows in the herd was infected with Streptococcus agalactiae, and the prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus was low. Cows were not treated with antibiotics at cessation of milking. A threefold increase in the percentage of quarters infected with major mastitis-causing pathogens developed from late lactation to early involution. Coliforms and streptococci other than Str agalactiae accounted for 94% of major pathogen infections. The number of quarters infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci increased slightly from late lactation to early involution, whereas the number of quarters infected with Corynebacterium bovis decreased markedly. Major pathogens caused 101 of 153 IMI at parturition and greater than 90% were caused by streptococci and coliforms. At parturition, 51 of 52 minor pathogen IMI were caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci. During early lactation, there was a marked decrease in quarters infected with major pathogens; however, the number of quarters with major pathogen IMI during early lactation was 2.3 times higher than the number of quarters infected before cessation of milking. The number of quarters with minor pathogen IMI during early lactation was the same as at parturition, but a marked decrease in quarters infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci and a marked increase in C bovis IMI developed from parturition to early lactation.
TI  - Fermentation of peptides and amino acids by a monensin-sensitive ruminal Peptostreptococcus.
AB  - A monensin-sensitive ruminal peptostreptococcus was able to grow rapidly (growth  rate of 0.5/h) on an enzymatic hydrolysate of casein, but less than 23% of the amino acid nitrogen was ever utilized. When an acid hydrolysate was substituted for the enzymatic digest, more than 31% of the nitrogen was converted to ammonia and cell protein. Coculture experiments and synergisms with peptide-degrading strains of Bacteroides ruminicola and Streptococcus bovis indicated that the peptostreptococcus was unable to transport certain peptides or hydrolyze them extracellularly. Leucine, serine, phenylalanine, threonine, and glutamine were deaminated at rates of 349, 258, 102, 95, and 91 nmol/mg of protein per min, respectively. Deamination rates for some other amino acids were increased when the amino acids were provided as pairs of oxidized and reduced amino acids (Stickland reactions), but these rates were still less than 80 nmol/mg of protein per min. In continuous culture (dilution rate of 0.1/h), bacterial dry matter and ammonia production decreased dramatically at a pH of less than 6.0. When dilution rates were increased from 0.08 to 0.32/h (pH 7.0), ammonia production increased while production of bacterial dry matter and protein decreased. These rather peculiar kinetics resulted in a slightly negative estimate of maintenance energy and could not be explained by a change in fermentation products. Approximately 80% of the cell dry matter was protein. When corrections were made for cell composition, the yield of ATP was higher than the theoretical maximum value. It is possible that mechanisms other than substrate-level phosphorylation contributed to the energetics of growth.

TI  - Preservation of capsular material of streptococcal cells by specific lectins determined by immunoelectron microscopy.
AB  - We describe the use of lectins as specific stabilizing agents for the polysaccharide capsular components of two Gram-positive bacteria, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus bovis. Treatment of bacterial suspensions with wheatgerm agglutinin and concanavalin A allowed better morphological preservation as well as immunoelectron microscopic localization of a capsular component (lipoteichoic acid) by employing specific antibodies and the protein A-gold technique. Data obtained indicate that lectins are useful agents in preserving highly water-soluble capsular components during the electron microscopy procedures for both unembedded and embedded samples.
TI  - In-vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of LY163892.
AB  - LY163892 is a new orally absorbed carbacephem. It inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Str. pneumoniae at less than or equal to 1 mg/l, but was less active against group B streptococci and groups C, F, G and bovis streptococci with MICs of 1 to 2 mg/l for most but as high as 8 mg/l for some isolates. MIC90 of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus was 8 mg/l, but greater than 128 mg/l for methicillin-resistant staphylococci. LY163892 had activity similar to cefaclor and cephalexin with MIC90 values of 16 mg/l for Escherichia coli, 8 mg/l for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Yersinia enterocolitica, but was more active against Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis. It had no activity against Enterobacter, Providencia, Serratia, and Pseudomonas and Bacteroides spp. LY163892 was more rapidly lytic than cephalexin. It was hydrolyzed by a number of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. For TEM-1, the Km = 354.7 microM, Vmax = 2.5 microMoles/min/mg of protein, P99 Km = 24.3 microM, Vmax = 28.9 microM/min/micrograms of protein, Staph. aureus PC Km = 47.4 microM, Vmax = 2.7 microMoles/min/mg of protein. Overall it had beta-lactamase stability similar to cefaclor, less than cephalexin, and markedly less than cefuroxime.

AB  
TI  - Esterase activities in Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens strains.
AB  - Thirty strains of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens isolated in diverse geographical locations were examined for esterase activity by using naphthyl esters of acetate, butyrate, caprylate, laurate, and palmitate. All strains possessed some esterase activity, and high levels of activity were observed with strains 49, H17c, S2, AcTF2, and LM8/1B. Esterase activity also was detected in other ruminal bacteria (Bacteroides ruminicola, Selenomonas ruminantium, Ruminobacter amylophilus, and Streptococcus bovis). For all B. fibrisolvens strains tested, naphthyl fatty acid esterase activity paralleled culture growth and was predominantly cell associated. With strains 49, CF4c, and S2, the activity was retained by protoplasts made from whole cells. Esterase activity was detected with all strains when grown on glucose, and some strains showed higher activity levels when grown on other substrates (larchwood xylan or citrus pectin). When nitrophenyl esters of fatty acids were used to measure esterase activity, generally four- to sevenfold-higher activity levels were detected, and with a number of strains substantial levels were found in the culture fluid. Cultures of these strains (H17c, NOR37, D1, and D30g) contained xylanase and acetyl xylan esterase activities, neither of which was associated to any great extent with the cells. Acetyl xylan esterase has not been previously detected in ruminal bacteria and may be important to overall digestion of forage by these organisms.
TI  - Sodium-dependent transport of neutral amino acids by whole cells and membrane vesicles of Streptococcus bovis, a ruminal bacterium.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis JB1 cells were able to transport serine, threonine, or alanine, but only when they were incubated in sodium buffers. If glucose-energized cells were washed in potassium phosphate and suspended in potassium phosphate buffer, there was no detectable uptake. Cells deenergized with 2-deoxyglucose and incubated in sodium phosphate buffer were still able to transport serine, and this result indicated that the chemical sodium gradient was capable of driving transport. However, when the deenergized cells were treated with valinomycin and diluted into sodium phosphate to create both an artificial membrane potential and a chemical sodium gradient, rates of serine uptake were fivefold greater than in cells having only a sodium gradient. If deenergized cells were preloaded with sodium (no membrane potential or sodium gradient), there was little serine transport. Nigericin and monensin, ionophores capable of reversing sodium gradients across membranes, strongly inhibited sodium-dependent uptake of the three amino acids. Membrane vesicles loaded with potassium and diluted into either lithium or choline chloride were unable to transport serine, but rapid uptake was evident if sodium chloride was added to the assay mixture. Serine transport had an extremely poor affinity for sodium, and more than 30 mM was needed for half-maximal rates of uptake. Serine transport was inhibited by an excess of threonine, but an excess of alanine had little effect. Results indicated that S. bovis had separate sodium symport systems for serine or threonine and alanine, and either the membrane potential or chemical sodium gradient could drive uptake.
TI  - [Endocarditis or bacteremia caused by Streptococcus bovis and colorectal neoplasms].
AB  - Streptococcus bovis is a relatively frequent causative agent of endocarditis or bacteriaemia, particularly in the elderly. In the past S. bovis has often been incompletely or even falsely classified. For therapeutic and prognostic reasons it is important to classify this agent exactly with biochemical methods even in the routine laboratory. Endocarditis or bacteriaemia due to S. bovis are often seen in conjunction with malignant, potentially malignant or benign colorectal neoplasias. After endocarditis or bacteriaemia due to S. bovis thorough investigation of colon and rectum is indicated. On the other hand, in presence of fever in patients with colorectal tumors, S. bovis bacteriaemia or endocarditis must be considered. The available literature is inconclusive on the question whether, after S. bovis endocarditis or bacteriaemia with initially normal colorectal findings, examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract and periodic inspection of the colon is needed. Up to now there has been no satisfactory explanation for the concomitant occurrence of endocarditis or bacteriaemia due to S. bovis and colorectal neoplasia.
TI  - Identification of viridans streptococci by three commercial systems.
AB  - The API 20S (Analytab Products, Plainview, NY), the GPI card (Vitek Systems, St.  Louis, MO) and the RapSTR system (Innovative Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) were compared with conventional biochemicals for the identification of viridans streptococci. One hundred nine clinical isolates were tested that included the following species: intermedius (38) sanguis II (20), bovis (variant) (14), mitis (14), salivarius (11), sanguis I (6), constellatus (3), mutans (2), and uberis (1). With initial testing, a correct species call was made with 72% of the isolates with the GPI card, 62% with the RapSTR, and 50% with the API 20S. Identifications of viridans streptococci group or those that needed additional biochemicals for species identification occurred with 28% of isolates with the API 20S, 8% with the RapSTR, and 9% with the GPI card. Incorrect identifications occurred with 6% of the isolates tested by the GPI card, 20% with the API 20S, and 30% with the RapSTR. Most discrepancies with the RapSTR were with 66% of the intermedius isolates, whereas most, 55%, of misidentifications with the API 20S were with sanguis II isolates. No identifications were made with 2% and 13% of isolates with the API 20S and GPI, respectively.
TI  - [Streptococcus bovis bacteremia and colonic diseases].
AB  - Four febrile patients were found to have a bacteraemia or endocarditis caused by  Streptococcus bovis. Although there were no gastrointestinal symptoms, polyps in the colon, of a high degree of malignancy, were discovered in three. In the fourth, carcinoma of the colon, requiring resection, was found seven years after Streptococcus bovis endocarditis. The polyps were removed by endoscopy and the Streptococcus bovis infection in all cases cured by penicillin. All four patients had accompanying resistance-lowering illnesses, which favoured microbial invasion.
TI  - Phagocytic and nitroblue tetrazolium reductive properties of bovine neutrophils for mammary pathogens.
AB  - A comparative evaluation of in vitro phagocytic and metabolic activities of freshly isolated bovine blood neutrophils from 26 cows was performed. Degrees of phagocytosis and nitroblue tetrazolium reduction by neutrophils were measured using zymosan, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Mycoplasma bovis, Salmonella sp., and Brucella abortus opsonized with fresh bovine serum. Percent phagocytosis and nitroblue tetrazolium reduction by the neutrophils were determined by microscopic evaluation of stained coverslip smears. Individual variation among cows was found in parameters measured, but age was not a contributing factor. Phagocytosis was high (73 to 81%) for E. coli, Salmonella sp., Strep. agalactiae, and zymosan; intermediate (64%) for Staph. aureus; and low (24 to 40%) for M. bovis and B. abortus. Nitroblue tetrazolium reduction was distinctly lower than zymosan (74%) for all microorganisms. Similar percentages (32 to 41%) of nitroblue tetrazolium reduction were observed for E. coli, Staph. aureus, Strep. agalactiae, and M. bovis; intermediate (28%) was obtained for Salmonella sp. and lowest (11%) for B. abortus.
TI  - [Pulmonary valve endocarditis caused by Streptococcus D bovis in a patient with a colorectal adenocarcinoma].
AB  - A case of pulmonary endocarditis caused by Streptococcus D bovis in a female patient with colorectal adenocarcinoma is reported. The M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiographic and pulsed doppler ultrasound findings are described. A review of the literature shows that Streptococcus D bovis pulmonary endocarditis is rare. Any septicaemia or endocarditis caused by this organism calls for invasive exploration of the digestive tract, and especially the colon.
TI  - Effect of naturally occurring intramammary infections by minor pathogens on new infections by major pathogens in cattle.
AB  - New mammary infections were recorded in 3 dairy herds during a lactation period by bacteriologic examination of milk samples at 3-week intervals. Influences of the infection status of quarters at the time of new infection and of microorganisms responsible for bacterial invasion were analyzed. The new infection rate in uninfected quarters was about 3 times the rate in quarters already harboring bacterial considered minor pathogens (coagulase-negative staphylococci and Corynebacterium bovis) or major pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci). The frequency of new infections with major pathogens was almost halved by preexisting infections with minor pathogens (P = 0.05), mainly because of coagulase-negative staphylococci (P = 0.05) and, to a lesser extent, C bovis (P = 0.19). New infections by minor pathogens also were less frequent in quarters harboring a major pathogen (P less than 0.05), indicating that the competition or antagonism between mammary infections was a general phenomenon.
TI  - Amylolytic activity of selected species of ruminal bacteria.
AB  - A variety of species of ruminal bacteria were screened for the ability to grow in starch-containing medium and produce amylase. Of those tested, the highest levels of amylase were produced by Streptococcus bovis JB1 and Ruminobacter amylophilus H18. Other strains that grew well on starch and produced amylase included Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens A38 and 49 and Bacteroides ruminicola 23 and B14. Varying the carbohydrate source provided for growth resulted in changes in the growth rate and level of amylase produced by these strains. All strains grew rapidly in starch-containing medium, and the rates of growth were generally more rapid than those observed for maltose-grown cultures. For S. bovis JB1, B. ruminicola 23 and B14, and B. fibrisolvens 49 and A38, amylase was produced when growth was on maltose or starch, but this activity was greatly reduced in glucose-grown cultures. The distribution of amylolytic activity between cellular and extracellular fractions was sometimes affected by the carbohydrate provided for growth. If S. bovis JB1 and B. fibrisolvens 49 were grown on starch, amylase was largely associated with cell pellets; however, if grown on maltose these strains produced activities that were almost entirely present in the extracellular fluid fractions. Although not as dramatic, a similar shift in the location of amylase activities was noted for the two B. ruminicola strains when grown on the same substrates. Growth on maltose or starch had little influence on either the predominantly cell-associated activity of B. fibrisolvens A38 or the activity of R. amylophilus H18, which was equally divided between cell pellet and extracellular fluid fractions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Differentiation of ruminal bacterial species by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using egg yolk antibodies from immunized chicken hens.
AB  - Cross-reactivity among four species of ruminal bacteria was examined by using egg yolk antibodies from immunized Leghorn laying hens and an enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay. The effects of the four species on the hens were compared on various days postimmunization. Hens injected with the same bacterial species had similar apparent antibody levels over the entire postimmunization period, but only Bacteroides ruminicola B1(4) and Selenomonas ruminantium D antigens elicited early increases in apparent antibody levels during weeks 2 and 3. Antibody cross-reactivity was greatly reduced by week 2, except for antibodies against Streptococcus bovis JB1.
TI  - Effects of source and washing of erythrocytes on growth of bacterial pathogens from the bovine mammary gland.
AB  - Effects of source and washing of RBC on quantitative growth and hemolytic zone sizes of common bacterial pathogens of the bovine mammary gland were evaluated. Blood samples used to prepare the blood agar media were obtained from 10 adult dairy cows, 10 dairy calves, and 10 sheep. Hemolytic zone sizes produced by Staphylococcus aureus were significantly (P less than 0.01) larger on blood agar prepared with washed RBC than on blood agar prepared with nonwashed RBC, regardless of RBC source. With the exception of Corynebacterium bovis, growth of all bacteria was equivalent or significantly higher on medium prepared with washed RBC, compared with that on medium prepared with nonwashed RBC, regardless of RBC source. Significantly higher numbers of C bovis (P less than 0.01) and Streptococcus agalactiae (P less than 0.01) were isolated on medium prepared with washed cow RBC. Significantly higher numbers of Str uberis (P less than 0.01) and S aureus (P less than 0.05) were isolated on medium prepared with washed sheep RBC and washed calf RBC, respectively. Growth of Escherichia coli was not affected by the RBC source. Seemingly, RBC used in the preparation of medium should be washed. The source of RBC, as well as inter-animal variation, also should be considered in the quality control of medium.
TI  - Susceptibilities of streptococcal strains associated with infective endocarditis  to nine antibiotics.
AB  - The susceptibilities of 121 streptococcal strains isolated from patients with infective endocarditis to mezlocillin, piperacillin, ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin were determined by the agar dilution technique. Viridans streptococci, Streptococcus bovis and Enterococcus faecalis were susceptible to imipenem, mezlocillin and piperacillin. All the strains, except E. faecalis were sensitive to ceftriaxone, ceftizoxime and ceftazidime and resistant to ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin. E. faecalis strains were moderately resistant to the new quinolons.

TI  - BMY-28100, a new oral cephalosporin: antimicrobial activity against nearly 7,000  recent clinical isolates, comparative potency with other oral agents, and activity against beta-lactamase producing isolates.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of BMY-28100 was tested against approximately 7,000 bacterial pathogens in a multicenter, multiphased collaborative investigation. The BMY-28100 spectrum and antimicrobial potency was most similar to that of cefaclor and superior to that of cephalexin among currently available cephalosporins. Species that had greater than or equal to 90% of clinical strains inhibited by BMY-28100 (less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml) were: Citrobacter diversus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus supp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. bovis, serogroup C and G streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes and gm-positive anaerobes. BMY-28100 inhibited 9% more of the 6286 fresh clinical isolates at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml than cefaclor at the same concentration. BMY-28100 was generally bactericidal, but MICs for some species were markedly increased when an inoculum concentration of 10(7) CFU/ml was used. Strains producing plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (TEM, OXA, SHV, HMS) were susceptible to BMY-28100, cefaclor, and cefuroxime. BMY-28100 was less active against strains producing chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases (Types I and IV). BMY-28100 was not hydrolyzed significantly by the tested plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but was destroyed by Type I cephalosporinases and Klebsiella K1 enzymes.
TI  - Partial characterisation of the inhibitory substances produced by Streptococcus oralis and related species.
AB  - The production of inhibitory substances was sought by deferred antagonism. Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis produced bactericidal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, but no detectable bacteriocin. Actinomycetes and Neisseria pharyngis were particularly susceptible to the lethal action of hydrogen peroxide. Streptococcus milleri produced bactericidal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocin-like substances. S. oralis strains were inhibited by the bacteriocin-like products of strains of Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus salivarius. Inhibition was due neither to complete bacteriophage nor to fermentation end-products. Extracellular polysaccharides formed during growth could not protect sensitive strains from the effect of hydrogen peroxide or bacteriocin-like substances.

TI  - The bacteria responsible for ureolysis in artificial dental plaque.
AB  - The origin of ureolytic activity in artificial-mouth plaques was established by assessing the contribution to plaque ureolytic activity of the isolated bacteria. To overcome losses of ureolytic activity caused by the unstable presence of urease in oral bacteria, ureolytic bacteria were isolated from an exceptionally active plaque (1 mumol NH3/min per mg protein) in which 63 per cent of the flora was ureolytic. After their ability to metabolize urea was stabilized, 13 ureolytic bacteria remained: seven strains of Streptococcus salivarius, one Streptococcus bovis, two Staphylococcus epidermidis and three Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Their urease activity, measured after growth into stationary phase, was reproducible and strain specific with a 20-fold range within each genus. The mean ureolytic activity of each species, when weighted by its calculated incidence in the original plaque, accounted for 40 per cent of the total plaque ureolytic activity. However, these values for urease levels were only a small fraction of the bacterial ureolytic potential. Urease per mg cell protein measured during the growth cycle of a selected Strep. salivarius, and Staph. epidermidis, varied 10-fold, and reached much higher activities (i.e. 6-8 mumol NH3/min per mg of cell protein) than under the growth conditions that were used to assess the contribution of these species to total plaque ureolysis. Thus urea metabolism in artificial plaque was due mainly to Strep. salivarius, with a small contribution from Staph. epidermidis. The presence of further unidentified species of ureolytic oral bacteria need not be invoked.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of teicoplanin in an in-vitro two-compartment kinetic model.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was studied in a model system in which antibiotic concentration is continuously varied. A two-compartment open model was used to reproduce, in vitro serum pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in humans during 24 h after iv administration. Staphylococcal and streptococcal strains of various species were tested. Teicoplanin showed rapid killing of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staph. hominis. All strains of Staph. epidermidis were rapidly killed in spite of the high MIC values (4-16 mg/l). The killing effect against Staph. haemolyticus was less rapid and marked than against Staph. epidermidis, with strain to strain variation. A 99.9% kill was achieved for most strains within 22 h, but with other isolates regrowth occurred which was due to the presence of highly resistant cells in the original population. Other staphylococci (Staph. aureus, Staph. saprophyticus) and Streptococcus pyogenes, Str. bovis and Str. salivarius were reduced by 99.9% within 22 h. Bactericidal activity against other streptococci (Str. mutans, Str. agalactiae, Str. faecalis, Str. faecium) was less marked; against Str. sanguis teicoplanin was bacteriostatic.
TI  - [Use of the colonizing preparation Amylastin in the stimulation of rumen-type digestion in young ruminants].
AB  - In experiments with calves during the milk-nutrition period we tested the use of  the colonisation preparation Amylastim, containing a bacterial strain of Streptococcus bovis AO 24/85, as a factor speeding up the development of the rumen microflora. We gave the preparation to the animals for a period of four weeks and studied its influence on the microflora adherent to the epithelium of the rumen wall. We ascertained a significant increase in the number of Streptococcus bovis germs (P less than 0.001) as well as of alpha-amylase activity (P less than 0.05). When giving the preparation Amylastim to calves in large-scale production conditions we ascertained a positive effect on the health condition, total losses being lower.

AB  
TI  - Bacteriology of viridans streptococcal bacteremia.
AB  - In order to assess the species distribution and the antibiotic susceptibility of  viridans streptococci in various human infections, we reviewed 164 cases of viridans streptococcal bacteremia seen at the National Taiwan University Hospital between May 1981 and April 1987. The organisms were isolated from 83 patients with endocarditis. Among 81 nonendocarditis patients, only 54 had clinically recognizable foci of suppurative inflammation. Mainly based on API 20 STREP system of species identification, S. sanguis II accounted for 24.4%; S. mitis, 20.7%; S. sanguis I, 20.1%; and S. milleri 2, 11.6% of the 164 cases studied. Of 83 endocarditis patients, 27.7% were S. sanguis I; 21.7%, S. sanguis II; and 16.9%, S. mitis. In nonendocarditis bacteremia with known suppurative lesions, 3 most often isolated organisms were S. sanguis II (24.0%), S. mitis (24.0%), and S. milleri 2 (24.0%). In nonendocarditis bacteremia without suppurative infection, the most frequent isolates were S. sanguis II (33.3%) and S. mitis (25.9%). In terms of relative frequency between endocarditis and nonendocarditis cases, S. mutan, S. sanguis I, and S. bovis had the highest frequency ratio of 7:1, 3.5:1, and 1.5:1, respectively. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin G, ampicillin, and cephalothin. Tetracycline resistance, however, were observed in 35.4% of the isolates; oxacillin resistance, 11.0%; and erythromycin resistance, 9.1%.
TI  - Noma in an unusual case of perforated appendicitis with pneumoperitoneum.
AB  - Noma is a very rare gangrenous infection of the oral cavity usually associated with debilitating diseases, immunosuppression, or malnutrition. Its development in a previously healthy 13-year-old boy with perforated appendicitis is presented. Streptococcus bovis type II and E coli were isolated from the noma and Streptococcus bovis, Bacteroides fragilis, and Bacteroides asacharolyticus from the peritoneal fluid. A transient impaired immune cellular function was found and may have contributed to the development of the noma in this child.
TI  - Adherence of S. bovis to adult buccal epithelial cells.
AB  - The ability of S. bovis 83/5364, glucan-positive (biotype I) and S. bovis R 81/536 glucan-negative (biotype II) to adhere to buccal epithelial cells (BEC) by lipoteichoic acid (LTA) was examined. LTA from both biotypes was prepared by cold phenol extraction from supernatants of penicillin supplemented cultures and partially purified by Sepharose CL-6B chromatography. Both glucan-positive and glucan-negative S. bovis strains adhered to BEC, but biotype I seemed to be more adhesive. For both biotypes the adhesion was not significantly inhibited by treatment of the bacteria with anti-LTA serum, while the preincubation of BEC with LTA, extracted from S. agalactiae, or cardiolipin strongly decreased the S. bovis binding.
TI  - Infective endocarditis: clinical features in young and elderly patients.
AB  - The elderly constitute an increasing percentage of patients with infective endocarditis. The disease manifestations and outcomes in 53 episodes of endocarditis in patients over the age of 60 were reviewed and compared with 55 episodes of endocarditis in patients less than 40 years of age and 46 episodes of endocarditis in patients aged 40 to 60. The percentage of cases caused by staphylococci and streptococci were roughly equal in all groups. Enterococci, Streptococcus bovis, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were more common in the elderly. In the elderly, invasive vascular procedures were the most common source of infection. Endocarditis acquired nosocomially accounted for 23 percent of all episodes in older patients. The elderly reported fewer symptoms and showed a diminished febrile response. Errors in diagnosis were noted in 68 percent of elderly patients, and a delay in initiating appropriate therapy was more common in this age group. The mortality rate was significantly higher in the elderly (45.3 percent) than in the middle-aged (32.6 percent) and young (9.1 percent). Endocarditis in elderly patients is often nosocomially acquired, is difficult to diagnose, and is associated with a higher mortality than noted in younger patients.
TI  - Effects of potassium ion concentrations on the antimicrobial activities of ionophores against ruminal anaerobes.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of monensin and lasalocid against representative strains of ruminal bacteria were evaluated in medium containing three different concentrations of potassium (1.3, 7.9, or 23.3 mM). The growth of Eubacterium ruminantium was inhibited by low concentrations of ionophores (less than or equal to 0.16 mg/liter), while the strain of Streptococcus bovis tested was resistant to high concentrations of ionophores (40 mg/liter) at all potassium concentrations tested. The MICs of the ionophores for strains of Bacteroides succinogenes, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Ruminococcus albus, and Ruminococcus flavefaciens and for one strain of Bacteroides ruminicola increased with increasing potassium concentrations in the medium. High concentrations of ionophores (40 mg/liter) decreased the maximum cell yields or increased the lag times or both in cultures of one strain of Bacteroides ruminicola and two strains of Selenomonas ruminantium but did not completely inhibit the growth of these organisms. Increased potassium concentrations in the medium (from 7.9 to 23.3 mM) decreased the lag times or increased the cell yields or both when these three strains were grown in ionophore-containing medium, while the activities of lasalocid and monensin against these organisms were enhanced in the medium containing low potassium concentrations (1.3 mM). The data from this study suggest that extracellular potassium concentrations may influence the antimicrobial activities of ionophores in the rumen.
TI  - Role of immunoblotting in the diagnosis of culture negative and enterococcal endocarditis.
AB  - Serum samples from patients with endocarditis and septicaemia due to Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus bovis, and Streptococcus sanguis were immunoblotted against antigenic extracts from all four species. In E faecalis endocarditis there was a strong IgM response to E faecalis antigenic bands of 112, 88-90, and 45-47 Kd and a strong IgG response to 88-90 and 45-47 Kd bands. In E faecium endocarditis there was a pronounced IgG response to an E faecium band of 82-90 Kd. For S bovis endocarditis, there was a strong IgG response to several components of S bovis including bands of 66, 58, 52 and 4 Kd. For S sanguis, there was a strong IgG response to bands of 80-82, 76, 60 and 45 Kd. These patterns of antibody production were absent in patients with uncomplicated septicaemia and in controls. The delineation of these patterns enabled confirmation of the final diagnosis in seven patients initially suspected of having culture negative endocarditis.
TI  - Transport and phosphorylation of disaccharides by the ruminal bacterium Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - Toluene-treated cells of Streptococcus bovis JB1 phosphorylated cellobiose, glucose, maltose, and sucrose by the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system. Glucose phosphorylation was constitutive, while all three disaccharide systems were inducible. Competition experiments indicated that separate phosphotransferase systems (enzymes II) existed for glucose, maltose, and sucrose. [14C]maltose transport was inhibited by excess (10 mM) glucose and to a lesser extent by sucrose (90 and 46%, respectively). [14C]glucose and [14C]sucrose transports were not inhibited by an excess of maltose. Since [14C]maltose phosphorylation in triethanolamine buffer was increased 160-fold as the concentration of Pi was increased from 0 to 100 mM, a maltose phosphorylase (Km for Pi, 9.5 mM) was present, and this activity was inducible. Maltose was also hydrolyzed by an inducible maltase. Glucose 1-phosphate arising from the maltose phosphorylase was metabolized by a constitutive phosphoglucomutase that was specific for alpha-glucose 1-phosphate (Km, 0.8 mM). Only sucrose-grown cells possessed sucrose hydrolase activity (Km, 3.1 mM), and this activity was much lower than the sucrose phosphotransferase system and sucrose-phosphate hydrolase activities.
TI  - Interactions between rumen amylolytic and lactate-utilizing bacteria in growth on starch.
AB  - The growth and metabolism of the rumen amylolytic bacteria Streptococcus bovis, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and Bacteroides ruminicola, growing in pure cultures and co-cultures with the rumen lactilytic bacteria Megasphaera elsdenii and Veillonella alcalescens were followed. The interaction of amylolytic bacteria with V. alcalescens represents a simple food chain. The interaction with M. elsdenii is more complex, since there is a simultaneous competition for products of the starch degradation.
TI  - Therapy of streptococcal endocarditis: correlation of animal model and clinical studies.
AB  - Streptococci (viridans group, Streptococcus bovis, enterococci still account for  the majority of cases of infective endocarditis in the non-addict population. Experimental animal models of endocarditis have been used (primarily in rabbits) to delineate the major therapeutic principles of this disease; viz. bactericidal antimicrobial agents must be given parenterally in high dosages for prolonged period of time. Overall, there is a good correlation between results obtained by: (1) in-vitro susceptibility testing (especially killing kinetics in broth); (2) therapeutic comparisons in experimental animal models and (3) clinical trials of different antimicrobial regimens in humans with streptococcal endocarditis. This review contrasts the published results obtained in vivo with experimental animal models to those obtained with various therapeutic approaches to streptococcal endocarditis in humans. The contribution of animal models to current therapeutic recommendations in man is underscored.
TI  - Antimicrobial therapy of streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  - The majority of patients with endocarditis caused by viridans streptococci or Streptococcus bovis susceptible to less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l of penicillin may be treated successfully for two weeks with penicillin 20 X 10(6) million units intravenously together with streptomycin 7.5 mg/kg body weight intramuscularly twice daily or gentamicin 1 mg/kg body weight intravenously every 8 h. Patients with nutritionally variant viridans streptococcal endocarditis should be treated for four weeks with penicillin combined with an aminoglycoside in dosages as above, which will require adjustment when renal impairment is present. Patients with enterococcal endocarditis should be treated with penicillin together with an aminoglycoside in dosages as above for four to six weeks. Patient with enterococcal endocarditis with symptoms of infection less than three months in duration or with aortic valve endocarditis may be treated successfully for four weeks with antimicrobial therapy; patients with symptoms of infection longer than three months in duration or with mitral valve infection should receive six weeks of antimicrobial therapy. Patients with enterococcal endocarditis who relapse should be treated for six weeks of antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Factors affecting the rate of breakdown of bacterial protein in rumen fluid.
AB  - 1. The cellular proteins of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Lactobacillus casei, Megasphaera elsdenii, Selenomonas ruminantium and Streptococcus bovis were labelled by growth in the presence of L-[14C]leucine, and the breakdown of labelled protein was measured in incubations of these bacteria with rumen fluid to which unlabelled 5 mM-L-leucine was added. The rate of protein breakdown was estimated from the rate of release of radioactivity into acid-soluble material. 2. Protein breakdown occurred at different rates in different species. The mean rates for B. fibrisolvens, L. casei, M. elsdenii, Sel. ruminantium and Str. bovis were 28.6, 18.1, 17.7, 10.5 and 5.3%/h respectively in samples of strained rumen fluid (SRF) with different protozoal populations. Rates of 3%/h or less were found in SRF from ciliate-free sheep or in faunated SRF from which protozoa had been removed by centrifugation. Further removal of mixed rumen bacteria had little effect. Suspensions of washed protozoa degraded bacterial protein at rates which were of the same order as those found in SRF. 3. The rate of breakdown of bacterial protein in different samples of SRF tended to increase as the numbers of small entodiniomorphid protozoa increased. The numbers of larger entodiniomorphs and holotrichs had no obvious influence on this rate. 4. Autoclaved and u.v.-treated bacteria were generally no different from live bacteria in their susceptibility to breakdown in SRF from faunated sheep, indicating that endogenous protein turnover was not a significant cause of bacterial protein catabolism. 5. The rate of bacterial protein breakdown was unrelated to the proteolytic activity of SRF. 6. It was concluded that predation by small protozoa is by far the most important cause of bacterial protein turnover in the rumen, with autolysis, other lytic factors and endogenous proteolysis being of minor importance.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis bacteraemia associated with candidal lesions of the large bowel in a leukaemic child. A case report.
AB  - A 5-year-old boy with acute myeloblastic leukaemia had large-bowel masses, demonstrated at autopsy, 5 weeks after an episode of Streptococcus bovis bacteraemia. The association of Strept. bovis bacteraemia with large-bowel disease, well documented in adults, should be considered in children.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis meningitis.
AB  
TI  - Susceptibility and resistance of ruminal bacteria to antimicrobial feed additives.
AB  - Susceptibility and resistance of ruminal bacterial species to avoparcin, narasin, salinomycin, thiopeptin, tylosin, virginiamycin, and two new ionophore antibiotics, RO22-6924/004 and RO21-6447/009, were determined. Generally, antimicrobial compounds were inhibitory to gram-positive bacteria and those bacteria that have gram-positive-like cell wall structure. MICs ranged from 0.09 to 24.0 micrograms/ml. Gram-negative bacteria were resistant at the highest concentration tested (48.0 micrograms/ml). On the basis of their fermentation products, ruminal bacteria that produce lactic acid, butyric acid, formic acid, or hydrogen were susceptible and bacteria that produce succinic acid or ferment lactic acid were resistant to the antimicrobial compounds. Selenomonas ruminantium was the only major lactic acid-producing bacteria resistant to all the antimicrobial compounds tested. Avoparcin and tylosin appeared to be less inhibitory (MIC greater than 6.0 micrograms/ml) than the other compounds to the two major lactic acid-producing bacteria, Streptococcus bovis and Lactobacillus sp. Ionophore compounds seemed to be more inhibitory (MIC, 0.09 to 1.50 micrograms/ml) than nonionophore compounds (MIC, 0.75 to 12.0 micrograms/ml) to the major butyric acid-producing bacteria. Treponema bryantii, an anaerobic rumen spirochete, was less sensitive to virginiamycin than to the other antimicrobial compounds. Ionophore compounds were generally bacteriostatic, and nonionophore compounds were bactericidal. The specific growth rate of Bacteroides ruminicola was reduced by all the antimicrobial compounds except avoparcin. The antibacterial spectra of the feed additives were remarkably similar, and it appears that MICs may not be good indicators of the potency of the compounds in altering ruminal fermentation characteristics.
TI  - Lack of association of Streptococcus bovis with noncolonic gastrointestinal carcinoma.
AB  - Since previous studies have shown an increased fecal carriage rate of Streptococcus bovis in patients with carcinoma of the colon, a study was undertaken to determine the fecal carriage rate of this organism in patients with gastrointestinal carcinoma of noncolonic origin. Organisms identified as S. bovis were isolated on fecal culture from 10 of 82 (12%) controls, 19 of 94 (20%) individuals with noncolonic gastrointestinal carcinoma, and 12 of 80 (15%) patients with other gastrointestinal disorders. Subjects with noncolonic gastrointestinal carcinoma did not have a fecal carriage rate of S. bovis significantly different from that in controls. A literature review of 251 patients with S. bovis septicemia identified at least 89 (35%) with neoplasms of the colon. Only nine patients (4%) with gastrointestinal neoplasms of other than colonic origin were noted. At present, the indication for an intensive evaluation of the upper gastrointestinal tract in individuals with S. bovis bacteremia is substantially less than that for the colon.
TI  - Growth responses of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae to Corynebacterium bovis metabolites.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae growth responses to metabolites of Corynebacterium bovis cultured in media containing polyoxyethylenesorbitan monolaurate, monooleate, or trioleate and milk were determined. Filter sterilized metabolites of 48-h C. bovis cultures in synthetic media were added to cultures of Staph. aureus and Strep. agalactiae. Staphylococcus aureus and Strep. agalactiae were inoculated into 12-h C. bovis milk cultures. Growth responses of Staph. aureus and Strep. agalactiae were not affected by C. bovis metabolites of synthetic media. Staphylococcus aureus growth was inhibited during logarithmic and stationary phases in milk containing mixed cultures of C. bovis compared with growth in pure Staph. aureus cultures. Streptococcus agalactiae growth curves were similar in pure and C. bovis mixed cultures. Fatty acid compositions were not different in sterile milk and milk containing bacterial cultures. Growth responses of Staph. aureus and Strep. agalactiae were not related to concentration of C. bovis metabolites or fatty acid content of media in which C. bovis were cultured.
TI  - Comparative survival of antibiotic-resistant and -sensitive fecal indicator bacteria in estuarine water.
AB  - The survival of antibiotic-resistant and -sensitive strains of Escherichia coli,  Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus equinus, and two environmental isolates, AP17 and AQ62, was examined in estuarine water. Each strain was rendered resistant to a combination of two antibiotics by serial passage in increasing concentrations of antibiotics. Cultures were incubated in filter-sterilized estuarine water for up to 7 days. Recovery was assessed by examining colony-forming ability on media with and without antibiotics. None of the antibiotic-resistant forms survived longer than its antibiotic-sensitive counterpart in estuarine water. Three of the resistant strains died off more rapidly than the antibiotic-sensitive wild type. Survival of the test bacteria in estuarine water was as follows: sensitive and resistant AQ62, resistant Escherichia coli less than sensitive Escherichia coli less than resistant AP17 less than resistant Enterococcus faecium less than sensitive AP17, sensitive and resistant S. equinus less than sensitive and resistant Enterococcus faecalis, sensitive Enterococcus faecium. The results supported the suggestion that fecal entercocci may serve as better indicators of fecal pollution than Escherichia coli in marine ecosystems. Moreover, the results indicated that the use of antibiotic-resistant mutants to follow the fate of bacteria in the environment is inappropriate without adequate studies to ensure that resistant and wild-type strains react similarly to environmental stressors.
TI  - [Infectious endocarditis caused by Streptococcus bovis and alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by hepatoma].
AB  - The case is reported of a 66-year old man who developed Streptococcus bovis endocarditis on a fairly loose aortic stenosis and who also presented with alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by an ultimately lethal hepatoma. On this occasion, comments are made on the following points: -Str. bovis is increasingly responsible for bacterial endocarditis. This micro-organism is now rapidly and reliably identified. -Str. bovis endocarditis has some clinical features of its own. -Patients in whom the usual portals of entry of bacterial infection (i.e. benign or malignant tumours of the colon or rectum) cannot be identified should be investigated systematically for hepatic cirrhosis. -Drug sterilization of the gut is useful to prevent bacteremia of intestinal origin in cirrhotic patients.
TI  - Experimental infection of lactating bovine mammary glands with Streptococcus uberis in quarters colonized by Corynebacterium bovis.
AB  - Twenty-seven quarters of 18 lactating dairy cows were inoculated intramammarily with 3.6 X 10(4) colony-forming units (CFU) of a strain of Streptococcus uberis isolated from a cow with clinical mastitis. Before quarters were inoculated, 22 were considered as naturally colonized with Corynebacterium bovis, and 5 were considered bacteriologically negative. Streptococcus uberis was isolated from all quarters within 2 days after inoculation, and all quarters developed clinical mastitis by 3 days after inoculation. Mastitis was acute, and most cows had increased rectal temperatures. The number of somatic cells increased significantly (P less than 0.05), and milk production decreased significantly. In many cows, rectal temperatures remained increased, and Str uberis was isolated from infected glands after intramammary and systemic antimicrobial treatments were given. A decreased number (110 CFU) of the same strain of Str uberis caused equally severe mastitis in 3 quarters colonized with C bovis and in 1 bacteriologically negative quarter in 2 cows. Streptococcus uberis was isolated from all inoculated quarters, and all quarters developed clinical mastitis by 2 days after inoculation. Two quarters colonized with C bovis and 2 bacteriologically negative quarters were inoculated once with 25 CFU and once with 240 CFU of a different strain of Str uberis (ATCC 27958). Streptococcus uberis was never isolated from inoculated quarters, and changes in milk yield or number of somatic cells were not observed.
TI  - A proposed mechanism of monensin action in inhibiting ruminal bacterial growth: effects on ion flux and protonmotive force.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis, a Gram-positive ruminal bacterium, was unable to grow in the presence of monensin. When monensin (5 mg/liter) was added to actively growing cultures, there was an immediate decrease in growth rate, and within 3 h no further growth was observed. Glucose utilization and lactate production continued for another 8 h even though growth had ceased. Monensin caused a decrease (P less than .05) in intracellular K+, a decrease (P less than .05) in intracellular pH and an increase (P less than .05) in intracellular Na+. The net exchange of K+ for Na+ and H+ via monensin was driven by the difference in concentration of K+ and Na+ across the cell membrane. Non-treated cells maintained a 70-fold gradient (inside higher) for K+, while the Na+ gradient was only 2.7-fold (inside higher). Previous models were based on a reverse mechanism whereby monensin would drive an efflux of Na+ from ruminal bacteria, and were not supported by experimental measurements of intracellular Na+ and K+.
TI  - Growth inhibition of mastitis pathogens by long-chain fatty acids.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hyicus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Corynebacterium bovis were tested for sensitivity to long-chain fatty acids predominant in teat canal keratin. Antibacterial activity of free fatty acids on each bacterial species was measured after 12 and 24 h in chemically defined media. Polyene C18:2 and C18:3 acids were bactericidal to each species at less than or equal to 10(5) ng/ml-1. The most bacteriostatic saturated fatty acids were C12 and C14. Streptococcus agalactiae growth was inhibited more by fatty acids after 24 h than after 12 h. No incubation time effect on growth responses of other species was determined. Polyoxyethylenesorbitan monooleate had a neutralizing effect on the bactericidal activity of polyene acids on C. bovis. Corynebacterium bovis were unable to grow in synthetic media containing individual free fatty acids as the sole source of preformed fatty acids. A relationship between bacterial species commonly isolated from bovine teat canals with resistance to fatty acids predominant in keratin was not evident.
TI  - Ruminal microbial development in conventionally or early-weaned calves.
AB  - Eight bull calves (four Holsteins and four Ayrshire calves with mean birth weight of 38.8 kg) were ruminally cannulated at 3 d of age and allocated to one of two weaning programs. All calves were fed colostrum for 3 d after birth and milk until weaning. Calves in the conventional-weaning program were fed a starter diet from 3 d of age and weaned at 6 wk of age. In the early-weaning program, calves were fed a highly palatable pre-starter diet from 3 d of age until they consumed 227 g/d, and then fed a mixture of pre-starter (227 g) and starter diet ad libitum. Calves in this group were weaned at 4 wk of age. Ruminal samples were collected at 3 and 7 d, then weekly thereafter through 8 wk and at 10 and 12 wk of age to assess microbial activity. Calves in the early-weaned group had a higher concentration of total ruminal volatile fatty acids at an earlier age than the calves in the conventional-weaning program. This was accompanied by a trend toward higher lactate concentrations and lower ruminal pH in the early-weaned group during their first 4 wk of age. Lactate and ammonia concentrations decreased with calf age. The total anaerobic bacterial counts increased slightly with calf age, whereas Streptococcus bovis and facultative bacterial populations decreased with calf age. Amylolytic, proteolytic, lactobacilli, lactate-utilizers, cellulolytic and methanogenic bacterial populations increased progressively in both groups. Cellulolytic and methanogenic bacteria were present in both groups at 3 d of age. No protozoa were detected in calves of either group. In general, the most significant changes in bacterial populations and metabolic activity in both groups occurred between 4 and 6 wk of age. Although calves in both groups had similar patterns of bacterial development, calves in the early-weaning program tended to have high ruminal microbial activity at an earlier age than the conventionally weaned calves.

TI  - Human choriogonadotropin-like material in bacteria of different species: electron microscopy and immunocytochemical studies with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies.
AB  - Immunocytochemical studies using antisera to whole human choriogonadotropin (hCG), to its alpha- and beta-subunits and to the COOH-terminal peptide of hCG beta, and two monoclonal antibodies to hCG beta, demonstrated expression of hCG-like material, its individual subunits and/or fragments in nine bacterial strains. Seven of these were isolated from patients with cancer and were definitely identified as Streptococcus faecalis (three strains), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (two strains) and Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli (single strains). The other two strains were cell-wall-deficient (CWD) variants, one identified as Streptococcus bovis, isolated from the blood of a patient with a fever of unknown origin and a possible brain abscess. The other was a Gram-negative diphtheroid isolated from the urine of a pregnant woman, which during the period of study reverted to a Gram-positive Corynebacterium identified as a 'C. ulcerans' strain and expressed the hCG-like factor only during its phase as Gram-negative diphtheroid. Electron microscopy of these nine strains (including negative controls of strains of the same species subjected to the same immunocytochemical analyses and under identical cultural conditions) revealed morphological alterations in the bacterial cell walls and cytoplasmic material and/or bizarre forms of reproduction in six of the nine strains expressing hCG-like material including the two CWD variants. Collectively, these results provided evidence that (1) hCG-producing bacteria isolated from patients with overt cancer are not a new and unique species as claimed by others, and (2) there is a close resemblance between the bacterial protein and the human trophoblastic hormone, based on immunochemical recognition of different parts of the hCG molecule.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - In vitro activity of LY146032 (daptomycin) against selected aerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new lipopeptide antibiotic LY146032 was generally four-fold greater (MIC 90 less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml) than that of vancomycin against methicillin-susceptible or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative species of Staphylococcus. Enterococci, Streptococcus bovis, group B and viridans streptococci, and Corynebacterium group J-K isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml of LY146032, which represented activity equivalent to or greater than that of vancomycin. Unlike vancomycin, LY146032 was bactericidal for Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Listeria monocytogenes. Due to its bactericidal properties LY146032 appeared to represent an improvement over vancomycin and teicoplanin.

TI  - [Identification of Streptococcus viridans in clinical specimens].
AB  - In a 4 year prospective study of "viridans" or non-groupable streptococci 100 clinically significant strains were isolated. Strains were defined as significant when found in two or more samples of blood cultures, or when seen on Gram staining together with inflammatory reaction. Fifty-two strains were speciated by 10 physiological characteristics. In 42 cases additional tests were performed. Only 16 isolates were unidentifiable by the techniques used. Sources of isolates included purulent lesions (53%) (mainly S. milleri and S. mitior); endocarditis (27%) (S. bovis I, S. sanguis, S. mutans, S. bovis II) and urinary tract infections (10%) (S. bovis II, S. milleri).
TI  - [Tricuspid endocarditis with right-left auricular shunt through a patent foramen  ovale].
AB  - The authors report the case of a tricuspid endocarditis secondary to Streptococcus bovis with important regurgitation and severe hypoxemia secondary to a right-left atrial shunt through a patent foramen ovale, requiring a surgical treatment which included the replacement of the tricuspid valve and closure of the dehiscence in the inter-atrial septum. The presence of a patent foramen ovale in the course of a tricuspid endocarditis has been exceptionally reported. This diagnosis deserves to be evoked in case of an unexplained hypoxic condition or a systemic embolism complicating a tricuspid endocarditis. The report emphasizes the advantage of ultrasonic examinations (contrast sonocardiography, pulsated Doppler) in order to demonstrate this right-left atrial shunt in addition to the data collected about the tricuspid valve.
TI  - Secretion composition during bovine mammary involution and the relationship with  mastitis.
AB  - 1. Bacteriological analysis revealed that 30% of quarters contained coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium bovis, or streptococci. 2. As involution progressed, somatic cell counts, percent protein, pH, and concentrations of serum albumin, lactoferrin, and immunoglobulin G increased while percent fat, concentrations of citrate, and the citrate to lactoferrin molar ratio decreased. 3. Mammary secretion from infected quarters had significantly higher numbers of somatic cells, percent polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and pH, but lower percentage lymphocytes, fat, and lactoferrin concentrations compared to uninfected quarters. 4. Results suggest intramammary infection altered normal secretion composition during bovine involution and lactogenesis. 5. Lower levels of antibacterial components in bovine mammary secretion during the peripartum period may have reduced the natural defense potential of the gland.
TI  - Seasonal changes in the cecal microflora of the high-arctic Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus).
AB  - The dominant cecal bacteria in the high-arctic Svalbard reindeer were characterized, their population densities were estimated, and cecal pH was determined in summer, when food quality and availability is good, and in winter, when it is very poor. In summer the total culturable viable bacterial population was (8.9 +/- 5.3) X 10(8) cells ml-1, whereas in winter it was (1.5 +/- 0.7) X 10(8) cells ml-1, representing a decrease to 17% of the summer population density. Of the dominant species of cultured bacteria, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens represented 23% in summer and 18% in winter. Streptococcus bovis represented 17% in summer and 5% in winter. Bacteroides ruminicola represented 10% in summer and 26% in winter. In summer and winter, respectively, the proportion of the viable population showing the following activities was as follows: fiber digestion, 36 and 48%; cellulolysis, 10 and 6%; xylanolysis, 33 and 48%; and starch utilization, 77 and 71%. The most abundant cellulolytic species in summer was Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, representing 62% of the total cellulolytic population, and in winter it was Ruminococcus albus, representing 80% of the total cellulolytic population. The most abundant xylanolytic species in summer was Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and in winter it was Bacteroides ruminicola, representing 59 and 54% of the xylanolytic isolates in summer and winter, respectively. The cecal bacterial of the Svalbard reindeer have the ability to digest starch and the major structural carbohydrates of the diet that are not digested in the rumen. The cecum in these animals has the potential to contribute very substantially to the digestion of the available plant material in both summer and winter.
TI  - Phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of hexoses by ruminal bacteria: evidence for the phosphotransferase transport system.
AB  - Six species of ruminal bacteria were surveyed for the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-dependent phosphorylation of glucose. Selenomonas ruminantium HD4, Streptococcus bovis JB1, and Megasphaera elsdenii B159 all showed significant activity, but Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49, Bacteroides succinogenes S85, and Bacteroides ruminicola B1(4) showed low rates of PEP-dependent phosphorylation and much higher rates in the presence of ATP. S. ruminantium HD4, S. bovis JB1, and M. elsdenii B159 also used PEP to phosphorylate the nonmetabolizable glucose analog 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG). Rates of 2-DG phosphorylation with ATP were negligible for S. bovis JB1 and M. elsdenii B159, but toluene-treated cells of S. ruminantium HD4 phosphorylated 2-DG in the presence of ATP as well as PEP. Cell-free extracts of S. ruminantium HD4 used ATP but not PEP to phosphorylate glucose and 2-DG. Since PEP could serve as a phosphoryl donor in toluene-treated cells but not in cell-free extracts, there was evidence for membrane and hence phosphotransferase system involvement in the PEP-dependent activity. The ATP-dependent phosphorylating enzymes from S. ruminantium HD4 and S. bovis JB1 had molecular weights of approximately 48,000 and were not inhibited by glucose 6-phosphate. Based on these criteria, they were glucokinases rather than hexokinases. The S. ruminantium HD4 glucokinase was competitively inhibited by 2-DG and mannose, sugars that differ from glucose in the C-2 position. Since 2-DG was a competitive inhibitor of glucose, the same enzyme probably phosphorylates both sugars. The S. bovis JB1 glucokinase was not inhibited by either 2-DG or mannose and had a higher Km and Vmax for glucose.

TI  - The effect of pH on the growth and metabolism of Streptococcus bovis in continuous culture.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis H13/1 was grown anaerobically at pHs between 5.0 and 6.5 in a glucose-limited chemostat at a dilution rate of 0.05/h. The growth yield and the production of acetate, ethanol and formate decreased at pHs less than 6.5 whereas the production of lactate increased at the lower pH values. When a culture was subjected to sequential pH changes, growth yield and fermentation products were influenced not only by the pH existing in the culture medium but also by the metabolic activity of the cells at the preceding pHs in the sequence. The results are discussed in relation to the mechanisms available for the maintenance of pH homeostasis and for the metabolic control of fermentation pathways in Strep. bovis.
TI  - Presumptive identification of "Streptococcus milleri" in 5 h.
AB  - Rapid miniaturized tests for acetoin production, arginine hydrolysis, and sorbitol fermentation were used for presumptive identification of non-beta-hemolytic "Streptococcus milleri" isolates in 5 h. All 77 "S. milleri" strains tested were Voges-Proskauer positive, arginine hydrolysis positive, and sorbitol fermentation negative. On the basis of these reactions, "S. milleri" was differentiated from isolates of other viridans group streptococcal species and from Streptococcus bovis.

TI  - Evaluation of aztreonam in the treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in  patients with cirrhosis.
AB  - To determine the efficacy of aztreonam in the treatment of spontaneous bacterial  peritonitis in patients with hepatic cirrhosis, 14 patients (7 males, 7 females) with 16 Gram-negative infective episodes (12 Escherichia coli and 4 Klebsiella pneumoniae) were treated with aztreonam infusions at doses of 1 gm per 8 hr for a planned 14-day period. Ages ranged from 40 to 75 years with a mean of 57 +/- 10 years. All organisms were highly susceptible to aztreonam (minimal inhibitory concentration less than or equal to 0.06 to 0.12 micrograms per ml). Serum antibiotic levels were 61.9 +/- 25.5 micrograms per ml (peak) and 27 +/- 18.5 micrograms per ml (trough). Ascitic fluid antibiotic levels were 33.6 +/- 22.5 micrograms per ml (peak) and 32.7 +/- 16.8 micrograms per ml (trough). Although the symptoms of infection were controlled within 3 days and ascitic fluid cultures became negative after 48 hr, 10 patients (62.5%) died, with hepatorenal syndrome and digestive tract hemorrhage as the principal causes of death. Three patients developed streptococcal superinfections during treatment; Streptococcus faecalis peritonitis in one case and spontaneous bacteremia due to Streptococcus equinus and Streptococcus mutans in the other two. Aztreonam was well tolerated and clinically and bacteriologically efficacious in controlling the infection. Serum and ascitic fluid levels were considerably higher than the minimal inhibitory concentration for the causative organisms, suggesting that lower doses may achieve suitable therapeutic levels. A negative aspect of the antibiotic therapy was the superinfections. The high mortality rate was attributable to the generally poor underlying condition of the patients.
TI  - Growth of gram-positive mastogenic bacteria in normal, simulated bulk tank, and mastitic milk held at simulated fluctuating temperatures of farm bulk tank.
AB  - Growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus bovis, and Streptococcus uberis was studied in normal milk, simulated bulk tank milk, and aseptic mastitic milk held at simulated fluctuating temperatures of farm bulk tank for 48 h. With the exception of S. bovis, growth rates of the other five bacteria were similar in both normal and simulated bulk tank milk. Mastitic milk inhibited growth of all bacteria studied. A 24-h adjustment period occurred before most of the bacteria started growing. The mastitis level in a dairy herd may be monitored by cultures of bulk tank milk samples and by calculations as discussed in this study.
TI  - Stoichiometry of glucose and starch splitting by strains of amylolytic bacteria from the rumen and anaerobic digester.
AB  - The stoichiometry of glucose and starch splitting by the amylolytic bacteria Streptococcus bovis, Selenomonas ruminantium, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Eubacterium ruminantium and Clostridium sp. was followed. There were many differences in the ratios of metabolites and in growth yields, as well as in the cell composition, between the growth on glucose and starch. The bacteria employ different nutritional strategies with respect to both energy sources.
TI  - Antibodies to bacterial vaccines demonstrating specificity for human choriogonadotropin (hCG) and immunochemical detection of hCG-like factor in subcellular bacterial fractions.
AB  - Investigations were done to determine whether vaccines prepared with chemically killed Staphylococcus haemolyticus RU1 and Streptococcus bovis AV46 (bacteria that have been demonstrated to express human choriogonadotropin [hCG]-like material on their surface) elicited antibodies in rabbits with specificity for hCG determinants. In addition, the anatomical locus of the hCG-like factor was determined by separation of bacterial subcellular fractions. The results demonstrated that these bacterial vaccines elicited antibodies immunologically similar to those antibodies produced in response to the whole human trophoblastic hormone, a similarity extending even to cross-reactivity with human luteinizing hormone. The bacterial hCG-like material appeared to be localized in the membranes of the cell wall, and most was present in the soluble membranous and cytoplasmic constituents. Its expression in bacteria was a strain characteristic and not a species characteristic.
TI  - Infective endocarditis due to penicillin-tolerant Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - Two Streptococcus bovis isolates obtained from patients with endocarditis were found to be tolerant to penicillin and other cell wall active agents. By time-kill analysis, penicillin and streptomycin acted synergistically against these strains. The existence of tolerant S. bovis strains should be considered when initially choosing antibiotics for the treatment of serious S. bovis infections.
TI  - Evaluation of .5% and 1% iodophor teat dips on commercial dairies.
AB  - Two postmilking teat dips containing .5 and 1% iodine were evaluated for approximately 8 mo under conditions of natural exposure to mastitis pathogens on four commercial dairy farms. In the two herds using .5% iodophor, incidence of intramammary infection with Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae was reduced 68.3 and 46.2%, respectively. When numbers of new infections with both pathogens were combined, efficacy for the .5% iodophor was 62.3%. In the two herds using 1% iodophor, incidence of intramammary infection with Staph. aureus and Strep. agalactiae was reduced 52.4 and 70.7%, respectively. When numbers of new infections with both pathogens were combined, efficacy for the 1% iodophor was 64.3%. Efficacy of teat dips was variable against coagulase-negative staphylococci and Corynebacterium bovis.
TI  - In vitro activity of flurithromycin, a novel macrolide antibiotic.
AB  - Flurithromycin is an (8,S)-8-fluoroerythromycin isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces erythraeus ATCC 31772, a blocked mutant of a strain producer of erythromycin. Its in vitro antibacterial activity has been determined on recent clinical isolates of respiratory pathogens. The range of MIC for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus group A is from 0.0015 to 0.006 microgram/ml, for Haemophilus influenzae from 0.012 to 0.4 microgram/ml, for Staphylococcus aureus from 0.1 to 3.1 micrograms/ml. Its action is bacteriostatic and increases at alkaline pH. Among anaerobes Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, other species of Bacteroides and Peptostreptococcus are particularly susceptible. Flurithromycin also showed some activity on Mycobacterium bovis, M. scrofulaceum and M. phley. The determination of killing curves indicated that in most cases a killing effect was obtained at 4 X MIC. A combination of flurithromycin with ampicillin or doxycycline sometimes was synergic, but more often additive and never antagonistic. The possible interference of flurithromycin on some parameters of the natural system of defense was determined. At concentrations equal to therapeutic levels in blood and tissues, flurithromycin did not influence chemotaxis, phagocytosis, metabolic activation and the killing activity of neutrophils.
TI  - Cell surface hydrophobicity of group D and viridans streptococci isolated from patients with septicaemia.
AB  - Sixty-three strains of Group D streptococci and viridans streptococci isolated from blood cultures during a two year period were typed to the species level with conventional biochemical tests and API Strep. Streptococcus faecalis was the most common species isolated followed by S. sanguis, S. mitis and S. constellatus (S. milleri). One of the two isolates of S. faecium was a contamination. The reported increasing frequency of this organism and other Group D and viridans streptococci as well as the association of S. bovis with malignant bowel disease indicate the need for full identification of streptococcal isolates from blood cultures. Pronounced surface hydrophobicity as measured with the salt aggregation test (SAT) was expressed by 59/63 (94%) of the blood culture isolates whereas strains isolated from commercial fermentation products and strains passaged several times were hydrophilic. In the presence of human serum albumin which binds to lipoteichoic acid only one strain decreased in surface hydrophobicity. The surface hydrophobicity of two strains even slightly increased indicating that lipoteichoic acid but marginally contributes to surface hydrophobicity of streptococcal cells from these species.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis catheter infection and the short bowel syndrome.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis bacteremia has been associated with several gastrointestinal  disorders, most notably carcinoma of the colon. This report describes a 57-year-old woman with short bowel syndrome in whom S. bovis bacteremia and an infection of an indwelling parenteral nutrition catheter developed. A barium enema revealed diverticula and a foreshortened small intestine. This case implicates the short bowel syndrome in the pathogenesis of S. bovis bacteremia and supports empiric antibiotic coverage for both skin flora and enteric pathogens in patients with Hickman catheter sepsis and known gastrointestinal pathologic conditions.

TI  - Vertebral osteomyelitis caused by Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - The association of Streptococcus bovis septicemia with abnominal neoplasms has been well-documented. The case of a man who presented with vertebral osteomyelitis due to S. bovis is reported; he was subsequently found to have bacteremia and colonic polyps. It is recommended that patients who present with localized as well as generalized S. bovis infections undergo yearly colonoscopy.
TI  - Rapid killing of actinomycin D-treated tumour cells by mononuclear phagocytes: reactivity in mouse strains with defective classical tumour cytotoxicity.
AB  - In confirmation of previous data, macrophages from C3H/HeJ, C57BL/10ScCR and A/J  mice, exposed in vivo to BCG or in vitro to lymphokines, had little tumoricidal activity, as assessed in a 48-hr [3H]thymidine release assay against TU5 tumour cells, compared to macrophages from C3H/HeN, C57BL/6 and (BALB/c X DBA/2)F1 mice. Macrophages from these mouse strains were examined for their capacity to kill actinomycin D-pretreated WEHI 164 sarcoma cells in a 6-hr 51chromium release assay (drug-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, DDCC). Peptone-elicited macrophages from C3H/HeN, C57BL/6, (BALB/c X DBA/2)F1, C57BL/10ScCR and A/J mice had high DDCC activity, whereas C3H/HeJ macrophages expressed little cytotoxicity against actinomycin D-pretreated WEHI 164 cells. In vivo exposure to BCG or inactivated streptococci caused a modest augmentation of the DDCC effector function of C3H/HeJ macrophages, but levels of reactivity remained 20-fold less than those of similarly treated normal mice. Thus, C57BL/10ScCR and A/J macrophages have defective classical direct cytotoxicity but mediate DDCC efficiently, whereas C3H/HeJ macrophages are defective in both effector functions.
TI  - Streptococcal endocarditis: single vs. combination antibiotic therapy and role of various species.
AB  - Forty-eight patients with 51 episodes of infective endocarditis caused by streptococci were studied in a comparison of the efficacy of single antibiotic therapy versus that of combination therapy. There was no statistical difference in terms of clinical course, toxicity, and mortality between the group given a single drug and that given combination therapy. However, one patient experienced two relapses, in both instances after high-dose penicillin therapy. The species and antibiotic susceptibilities of the infecting organisms were determined. The majority of isolates were alpha-hemolytic, with Streptococcus sanguis recovered most commonly. Streptococcus bovis and group B beta-hemolytic streptococci were the next most frequent isolates.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis bacteremia and underlying gastrointestinal neoplasms.
AB  - Two patients are described in whom Streptococcus bovis bacteremia was the only clue to the presence of a colonic neoplasm. A third patient had the rare association of gastric carcinoma and Streptococcus bovis bacteremia that followed an operation for the carcinoma. The need for both complete gastrointestinal survey in patients with Streptococcus bovis bacteremia and administration of appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis during surgical manipulation is emphasized.
TI  - In vitro activity of A-16686, a new glycopeptide.
AB  - A-16686 is a novel glycopeptide antibiotic derived from Actinoplanes. A-16686 inhibited hemolytic streptococci groups A, B, C, F, and G at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.06 to 0.5 microgram/ml, with 90% inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, including erythromycin-resistant isolates. S. bovis, various viridans groups streptococci, S. mitis, S. mutans, and S. sanguis were inhibited by less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, and MICs of S. faecalis and S. faecium were 0.5-2 micrograms/ml. Most staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant strains, were inhibited by 1 or 2 micrograms/ml. A-16686 was bactericidal with minimal difference between MIC and MBC for gram-positive species. A-16686 did not inhibit Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas.
TI  - [Association of bacterial endocarditis and alcoholic cirrhosis in 9 patients].
AB  - Ten cases of bacterial endocarditis were observed in cirrhotic patients. In 7 cases, endocarditis was due to group D Streptococcus, 5 of which were Streptococcus D. bovis. Special features were the involvement of tricuspid valve and the involvement of two or more valves in 4 cases. Surgery was necessary in the acute phase in 5 patients: cure was definitely obtained in 8 cases after a particularly long interval. A colonic lesion could have been the portal of entry in some cases. Liver cirrhosis was considered as a predisposing factor for bacterial endocarditis, especially due to group D Streptococcus or to other bacteria of intestinal origin. This is probably related to the frequency of the colonic origin of group D Streptococcus endocarditis. Loss of filter function of the liver may partly explain the features of these forms of endocarditis.
TI  - Synergistic induction of cytotoxicity in macrophages by murine interferon-gamma and biological response modifiers derived from microorganisms.
AB  - The ability of recombinant murine interferon-gamma (rMuIFN-gamma) to activate murine macrophages with or without several biological response modifiers (BRM), including synthetic muramyl dipeptide derivatives (MDPs), was investigated. Mouse peritoneal macrophages were activated by rMuIFN-gamma alone to the cytostatic state, but not the cytolytic state. Other BRM as well as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), including a lyophilized preparation of an attenuated strain of Streptococcus hemolyticus, a cell wall skeleton of bacillus Calmette-Guerin and synthetic MDPs, were highly active in generating the synergism with rMuIFN-gamma. Macrophages were endowed with the cytolytic activities by combinations of rMuIFN-gamma and MDP-Lys(L18); the combination of 100 U/ml of rMuIFN-gamma with 10 ng/ml of MDP-Lys(L18) was sufficient to induce cytolytic activities in macrophages. The synergism was observed when the macrophages primed with rMuIFN-gamma were treated with LPS or MDP-Lys(L18), but not when the sequence of treatment was reversed. The cytotoxicity of macrophages induced by rMuIFN-gamma with MDP-Lys(L18) was suppressed by priming with MDP-Lys(L18). The suppressive effect was also observed by priming with LPS in combinations of rMUIFN-gamma and LPS. The reason for the suppression of macrophage activation by priming with LPS and MDP-Lys(L18) is at present unknown.

TI  - Comparison of the effect of antibiotic dry cow teat canal and intramammary dry cow therapy of dairy cows on the prevalence of teat canal and intramammary infections at calving.
AB  - The specific therapy of bacterial colonization of the teat canals of dried-off dairy cows by means of small amounts (33 mg/0.25 ml and 14 mg/0.1 ml) of a procain benzyl penicillin-dihydrostreptomycin sulphate combination has been investigated. Of 36 teat canals treated with 0.25 ml antibiotic preparation each, 24 (66.6%) were infected at the beginning of the dry period, whereas at its termination only 7 (19.4%) showed bacteriologically positive swab cultures. By treating a further 43 quarters with 0.1 ml quantities of an antibiotic preparation each, the prevalence of infection dropped from 32.5% to 14%. Untreated controls (20 quarters) showed no significant change. Cultures of teat canal swabs were generally twice as sensitive for indicating the presence of bacteria compared to foremilk sample cultures. Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly isolated organism, followed by Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium bovis and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
TI  - [Splenic abscess disclosing endocarditis].
AB  - A 54 year old man, hospitalised for thoraco-abdominal pain resulting from a septicemia which gives positive hemocultures for streptococcus D Bovis, is diagnosed to have a splenic abscess which will require splenectomy. At the same time, an endocarditis develops and gets worse, with auriculo-ventricular blockade and, especially, major aortic insufficiency, which is the cause of death by a brutal and massive pulmonary oedema. In the progression of an endocarditis, the occurrence of a splenic abscess, primary localisation of the initial septicemia or the secondary of an arterial septic embolism, is a rare contingency compared to the frequency of splenomegaly or splenic infarction: less than 2 percent of the cases in the literature. This very atypical and exceptional case serves as a reminder, on the one hand, of the diagnostic inadequacy of echocardiography which cannot visualise vegetation in the course of progressive endocarditis, and, on the other, of the prognostic importance of auriculoventricular blockade in septal and aortic endocardial lesions.
TI  - Clinical and echocardiographic observations in pulmonary valve endocarditis.
AB  - Clinical and echocardiographic data from 12 patients with pulmonary valve endocarditis are described. Seven patients had isolated pulmonary endocarditis and in 5 patients other valves were infected (aortic, tricuspid, mitral or all 3). Two patients were heroin addicts and 4 had underlying heart disease (congenital heart disease in 3 and aortic regurgitation in 1 patient). The organisms involved were alpha streptococci in 3 patients (all with underlying heart disease), Staphylococcus aureus in 4, Streptococcus D bovis in 1 patient and Candida guillermondii in 1. M-mode and 2-dimensional echocardiography was performed in 10 patients and revealed vegetations in 8. Pulsed Doppler echocardiography was performed in 6 patients and revealed pulmonary regurgitation in all 6. Seven patients had pulmonary emboli. Four patients underwent surgery. Four patients died, including 1 after cardiac surgery. Five patients, including the patient infected with Candida guillermondii, recovered with antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Effects of Corynebacterium bovis infection on susceptibility to major mastitis pathogens.
AB  - Experimental challenge procedures were used to study infectivity and virulence of Corynebacterium bovis. Challenge procedures using Staphylococcus aureus (Newbould 305) and Streptococcus agalactiae (McDonald 44) were used to study effects of Corynebacterium bovis infections on superinfection with major pathogens. Rate of infection under experimental challenge conditions was significantly greater with Corynebacterium bovis than previously observed for Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus agalactiae. Principal location of Corynebacterium bovis colonization appeared to the teat canal region, although the organism was isolated from 75% of the teat cisterns by puncture technique. Quarters with Corynebacterium bovis infections were more resistant to infection by Staphylococcus aureus than bacteriologically negative quarters. Quarters infected with Corynebacterium bacterium bovis were approximately 8.5-fold more susceptible to Streptococcus agalactiae infection than negative quarters. Somatic cell counts were doubled in negative quarters that developed Corynebacterium bovis infections; the geometric mean was 2.4 X 10(5).
TI  - Antibiotic activity of an isocyanide metabolite of Trichoderma hamatum against rumen bacteria.
AB  - A metabolite of Trichoderma hamatum, 3-(3-isocyanocyclopent-2-enylidene)propionic acid, was tested for its effects on growth of and carbohydrate metabolism in 11 strains of functionally important rumen bacteria. To standardize the biological activity of this unstable metabolite, a rapid, aerobic disc diffusion assay was developed using Escherichia coli ATCC 11775. In an anaerobic broth dilution assay using a medium lacking rumen fluid and containing a soluble carbohydrate, the minimum inhibitory concentration of the metabolite which completely inhibited growth of the rumen bacteria for 18 h at 39 degrees C was generally less than 10 micrograms X mL-1; however, the minimum inhibitory concentrations for Megasphaera elsdenii B159 and Streptococcus bovis Pe(1)8 were 10-25 and 25-64 micrograms X mL-1, respectively. In general, the Gram-negative strains were more sensitive than the Gram positive. The minimum inhibitory concentration for Bacteroides ruminicola 23 grown with glucose was 1 micrograms X mL-1; for B. ruminicola GA33 (glucose), B. succinogenes S85 (cellobiose), and Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens 24 (maltose), it was 2 microgram X mL-1. When added to a cellulose-containing rumen fluid medium, 1-4 micrograms X mL-1 of the metabolite delayed cellulose hydrolysis by B. succinogenes S85, Ruminococcus albus 7, and R. flavefaciens FD1 for up to 4 days, and 6-7 micrograms X mL-1 prevented hydrolysis for at least 1 month. In the presence of the metabolite, the proportion of acetate produced from soluble carbohydrate by the majority of strains increased, but with some strains net production of acetate decreased relative to production of other acidic fermentation products.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Growth inhibition of Streptococcus mutans by cellular extracts of human intestinal lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro growth of Streptococcus mutans was completely inhibited by water-soluble extracts from cells of various intestinal lactic acid bacteria identified as Streptococcus faecium, Streptococcus equinus, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus salivarius. The growth inhibition was dependent on the concentrations of the extracts. In contrast, the extracts did not inhibit the growth of the major indigenous intestinal lactic acid bacteria isolated from humans. These lactic acid bacteria were not acutely toxic in mice.
TI  - In vitro growth of mastitis-associated streptococci in bovine mammary secretions.
AB  - Cell-free, fat-free mammary secretions were tested in vitro for ability to support growth of streptococci associated with mastitis. Secretions were obtained prior to drying off, during the dry period, at calving, and during lactation from four cow treatment groups. Treatment groups were dry cow therapy, dry cow therapy and mammary glands subjected to induced inflammation 7 d post-drying-off, no dry cow therapy and no induced inflammation, no dry cow therapy but mammary glands subjected to induced inflammation. Growth of Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus agalactiae in secretions from nonlactating glands was unaffected by induced inflammation. Growth of Streptococcus bovis was significantly inhibited in secretion obtained 14 d after induced inflammation. Dry cow therapy had no effect on streptococcal growth in secretion obtained 7 d after therapy. Streptococcal growth was greatest in secretions from involuted glands, and there was little or no evidence for growth inhibitory factors in cell-free, fat-free secretions obtained during the dry period. Milk from lactating glands inhibited streptococcal growth, and the inhibitory factor was presumptively identified as lactoperoxidase. Apolactoferrin, immunoglobulin, or both had little effect on streptococcal growth.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis bacteraemia requires rigorous exclusion of colonic neoplasia  and endocarditis.
AB  - Twelve patients presented to the hospitals of the Auckland Hospital Board with bacteraemia caused by Streptococcus bovis in the years 1979-84. Ten had endocarditis, affecting homograft valves in two cases and the tricuspid valve in one case. Of nine patients who underwent investigation of the large bowel, only one did not have a colorectal tumour. Three had colonic adenocarcinoma and three had colorectal villous adenoma. Two, including a patient with acute hepatic failure from alcoholic cirrhosis, had colonic adenomata. Colonoscopy provided a tissue diagnosis of colorectal neoplasia despite negative radiological studies in three patients. Bacteraemia due to S. bovis should prompt rigorous investigation to exclude both endocarditis and tumours of the large bowel.

TI  - Regulation of lactate production in Streptococcus bovis: A spiraling effect that  contributes to rumen acidosis.
AB  - When Streptococcus bovis was grown in batch culture with 6 g/L glucose at pH 6.7, maximum specific growth rate was 1.47 h(-1), and lactate was the primary fermentation product. In continuous culture at pH 6.7 and growth rate equal to .10 h(-1), little lactate was formed, and formate, acetate, and ethanol accounted for most of the product. When extra-cellular pH decreased to 4.7, intra-cellular pH declined to 5.4, and organisms switched back to lactate production. Intracellular concentration of fructose 1,6-diphosphate of batch culture cells was greater than 12 mM, a concentration that allowed maximal lactate dehydrogenase activity. When Streptococcus bovis was grown in continuous culture at pH 6.7, intracellular fructose-l,6-diphosphate declined to .4 mM, a concentration which gave little lactate dehydrogenase activity at pH 6.5 or greater. Decreasing pH of continuous culture to 4.7 increased intracellular fructose-1,6-diphosphate concentration to .8 mM. This concentration was still limiting if lactate dehydrogenase was assayed at pH 6.5, but nearly maximal activity was obtained when enzyme was assayed at pH 5.5. The small increase in fructose-l,6-diphosphate and decreased requirement of lactate dehydrogenase for fructose-l,6-diphosphate under acidic assay conditions, accounted for increased lactate production during low pH (4.7) continuous culture. These and other aspects of lactate regulation by Streptococcus bovis are discussed as factors leading to rumen acidosis. This pattern of regulation also helps to explain why rumen acidosis is difficult to reverse.
TI  - Seasonal changes in the ruminal microflora of the high-arctic Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus).
AB  - The dominant rumen bacteria in high-arctic Svalbard reindeer were characterized,  their population densities were estimated, and ruminal pH was determined in summer, when food quality and availability are good, and in winter, when they are poor. In summer the total cultured viable population density was (2.09 +/- 1.26) X 10(10) cells ml-1, whereas in winter it was (0.36 +/- 0.29) X 10(10) cells ml-1, representing a decrease to 17% of the summer population density. On culture, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens represented 22% of the bacterial population in summer and 30% in winter. Streptococcus bovis represented 17% of the bacterial population in summer but only 4% in winter. Methanogenic bacteria were present at 10(4) cells ml-1 in summer and 10(7) cells ml-1 in winter. In summer and winter, respectively, the proportions of the viable population showing the following activities were as follows: starch utilization, 68 and 63%; fiber digestion, 31 and 74%; cellulolysis, 15 and 35%; xylanolysis, 30 and 58%; proteolysis, 51 and 28%; ureolysis, 40 and 54%; and lactate utilization, 13 and 4%. The principal cellulolytic bacterium was B. fibrisolvens, which represented 66 and 52% of the cellulolytic population in summer and winter, respectively. The results indicate that the microflora of the rumen of Svalbard reindeer is highly effective in fiber digestion and nitrogen metabolism, allowing the animals to survive under the austere nutritional conditions typical of their high-arctic habitat.
TI  - Molecular genetics of resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin B  (MLS) in streptococci.
AB  - Resistance to macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin B (MLS phenotype) appears in  almost all streptococcal species isolated from man. Genes coding for MLS resistance are located on plasmids and one MLS resistance transposon has been described. MLS resistance genes have also been found in a large number of plasmid-free strains. Plasmids of 17 to 20 megadaltons (Mdal) that code either for MLS or for both MLS and chloramphenicol resistance are found in streptococci of groups A, B, C, D (Streptococcus faecalis) and G. These plasmids have broad host ranges (conjugative intraspecies, interspecies and intergeneric transfer), display similar restriction enzyme patterns and share a considerable degree of homology (78 to 95%). One smaller non-conjugative MLS resistance plasmid has been isolated from Str. sanguis (4.5 Mdal). In group D (Str. faecalis, Str. faecium) streptococci, MLS resistance genes are also found on plasmids that carry other antibiotic resistance (tetracycline, chloramphenicol, high-levels of streptomycin and kanamycin). These multi-resistance plasmids are either conjugative or non-conjugative and are of various sizes and molecular species and those that have been tested have narrow host-ranges. The MLS resistance genes of one multi-resistant plasmid, isolated from a strain of Str. faecalis, are located on a transposon of 3.3 Mdal, Tn917. Hybridization studies, with MLS determinants as probes, reveal homologies among various plasmid-borne MLS resistance sequences. Elements that are thought to be chromosome-borne mediate multiple antibiotic resistance (including MLS) in streptococci of groups A, B, C, D (Str. bovis), F, G, Str. pneumoniae, Str. mitis, Str. sanguis and Str. milleri. Strains harbouring such elements contain no detectable plasmid DNA. In some of the strains these elements are conjugative; their resistance markers transfer en bloc at low frequency and display narrow host ranges. Such elements, from Str. pyogenes and Str. agalactiae, were found to translocate onto various streptococcal haemolysin-bacteriocin plasmids.
TI  - Comparison of single doses of amoxicillin or of amoxicillin-gentamicin for the prevention of endocarditis caused by Streptococcus faecalis and by viridans streptococci.
AB  - Recent recommendations for the prophylaxis of endocarditis in humans have advocated single doses or short courses of antibiotic combinations (beta-lactam plus aminoglycoside) for susceptible patients in whom enterococcal bacteremia might develop or for patients at especially high risk of developing endocarditis (e.g., patients with prosthetic cardiac valves). We tested the prophylactic efficacy (in rats with catheter-induced aortic vegetations) of single doses of amoxicillin plus gentamicin against challenge with various streptococcal strains (two strains of Streptococcus faecalis, one of Streptococcus bovis, and three of viridans streptococci); we then compared this efficacy with that of single doses of amoxicillin alone. Successful prophylaxis against all six strains was achieved with single doses of both amoxicillin alone and amoxicillin plus gentamicin. This protection, however, was limited, for both regimens, to the lowest bacterial-inoculum size producing endocarditis in 90% of control rats and was not extended to higher inocula by using the combination of antibiotics. We concluded that a single dose of amoxicillin alone was protective against enterococcal and nonenterococcal endocarditis in the rat, but that its efficacy was limited and could not be improved by the simultaneous administration of gentamicin.
TI  - Changing pattern of infective endocarditis.
AB  - There has been a significant trend toward an increase in the age of patients with endocarditis, and it seems likely that the age of these patients will continue to increase as the population ages. The proportion of patients with endocarditis who have rheumatic heart disease as an underlying lesion has decreased from about 40 percent in patients studied from 1950 to 1970 to about 25 percent in more recent series, and this trend will probably continue. Prosthetic valves and degenerative heart disease will undoubtedly become increasingly important underlying heart lesions in patients with endocarditis. Another large group of patients with infective endocarditis have no diagnosable underlying heart disease and comprise an increasing proportion of patients with endocarditis. Because of the aging of the population, more Streptococcus bovis and enterococcal endocarditis should be expected. With more prosthetic valves and with the aging of the population, more staphylococcal endocarditis should be anticipated. Economic forces will probably result in earlier discharge from the hospital, with either shorter courses of therapy or completion of therapy at home and perhaps more valve replacements.
TI  - The rumen microbiology of seaweed digestion in Orkney sheep.
AB  - The microbial populations of the rumens of seaweed-fed and pasture-fed Orkney sheep were examined. The populations in the pasture-fed sheep were similar to those of other domestic ruminants fed on land plants, but those of the seaweed-fed animals showed major differences in the dominant species. Total ciliate populations were quantitatively similar, but in the seaweed-fed animals Dasytricha ruminantium was one of the most dominant species. No phycomycete fungi or cellulolytic bacteria were found in the seaweed-fed animals, and the bacterial population was dominated by Streptococcus bovis, Selenomonas ruminantium, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and lactate-utilizing species. Electron microscopy revealed that spirochaetes and an unidentified filamentous bacterium were probably of major significance in seaweed digestion. The ability of bacterial strains from both groups of animals to metabolize plant and algal constituents was examined.
TI  - Antistreptococcal activity of Sch 34343, a new penem antibiotic.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of Sch 34343 was compared with that of penicillin and cefotaxime against clinical isolates of streptococci. Sch 34343 was highly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans streptococci, streptococci of groups A, B, C and G, and Str. bovis. Ninety per cent of these strains were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25, less than or equal to 0.12 and less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l of Sch 34343, penicillin and cefotaxime respectively. Activity of Sch 34343 against Str. faecalis was only moderate. Sch 34343 had very good bactericidal activity against group B streptococci, and showed high MBC/MIC ratios against penicillin-tolerant viridans streptococci and Str. faecalis. Sch 34343, 20 mg/l, and gentamicin, 4 mg/l, were synergistic against both of the penicillin-tolerant viridans streptococci, and one-third of the Str. faecalis strains.
TI  - Cross-reactions between alpha-streptococci and Omniserum, a polyvalent pneumococcal serum, demonstrated by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination.
AB  - In recent years several groups have used serological methods to demonstrate pneumococcal capsular antigens in sputum. In the present study 123 strains of alpha-hemolytic streptococci (including 97 strains from sputum or pharyngeal specimens) were tested for cross-reactions with a polyvalent antipneumococcal serum (Omniserum). Representatives of the following species were included: Streptococcus bovis, S. equinus, S. intermedius, S. lactis, S. milleri, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. suis, and Aerococcus viridans. Serological reactions were detected by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination. Fifteen (12%) of the strains gave positive reactions by all three methods. Positive reactions were also observed with another 32 strains (26%) with two of the methods, whereas 37 strains (30%) gave positive reactions by just one technique. Altogether 84 (68%) strains gave positive reactions with one or more of the methods. Latex agglutination gave positive reactions with 26 (21%) strains compared with 57 (46%) in immunofluorescence and 63 (51%) in immunoelectroosmophoresis. Absorption of the antiserum with one alpha-hemolytic strain reduced but did not entirely eliminate the cross-reactions with five tested strains. These findings indicate a potential risk of cross-reactions with polyvalent antipneumococcal serum in tests carried out on sputa or other specimens which may be contaminated with alpha-hemolytic streptococci.
TI  - In-vitro inhibition of mycobacteria by viridans streptococci.
AB  - Eleven strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 13 other species of mycobacteria were examined for susceptibility to 26 strains of viridans streptococci. Susceptibility was detected by the simultaneous antagonism technique, but not by tests of deferred antagonism. It is concluded that in-vitro inhibition of mycobacterial growth by actively growing streptococci is due to a peroxide-mediated antagonism which is too variable to be of value for identification. However, a standard bactericidal test with hydrogen peroxide is worth investigation because this might provide a simple inexpensive aid for the identification of M. avium-intracellulare serotypes.
TI  - The phylogenetic position of Streptococcus and Enterococcus.
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes, S. equinus, S. bovis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. mutans, S. rattus, S. cricetus, S. lactis, S. raffinolactis and Enterococcus faecalis have been characterized by oligonucleotide cataloguing of their 16S ribosomal RNA. All the organisms form a loose but coherent group that is phylogenetically equivalent to those of lactobacilli, bacilli, the Brochothrix and Listeria group, and related taxa that constitute one of several sublines within the 'Clostridium' branch of Gram-positive eubacteria. Within the Steptococcus-Enterococcus group, organisms fall into three moderately related clusters defined by Enterococcus, the lactic acid streptococci and streptococci of the pyogenic and oral groups, respectively.
TI  - Effect of automatic backflushing on number of new intramammary infections, bacteria on teatcup liners, and milk iodine.
AB  - Effect of an automatic iodine (15 ppm) backflushing system on incidence of new intramammary infections, teatcup liner bacterial populations, and milk iodine was tested in a herd free of Streptococcus agalactiae and with a low prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus. In an 11-mo trial, backflushing was applied to teatcups that milked the right half of the udder; the left half served as control. Clawpieces were divided into left and right halves with each having a milk outlet. Postmilking teat dipping was discontinued. All lactating cows in the University herd were used, averaging 154 with normal attrition and additions of new individuals as they calved. Backflushing reduced numbers of staphylococci recovered from liners by 98.5% and Gram-negative bacteria by 99.5% as compared with unflushed liners. Backflushing significantly reduced new infections caused by Corynebacterium bovis. However, there was no effect on incidence of new infections by staphylococci, streptococci, or coliforms. Iodine concentrations averaged 243 micrograms per liter in milk from control quarters and 486 micrograms from backflushed udder halves. Interior surface cracking was more severe in backflushed teatcup liners than in control liners. These results do not justify the use of backflushing in a herd with low prevalence of contagious pathogens.

AB  - We designed a study to evaluate the fecal carrier rate of Streptococcus bovis in  patients with endoscopically proven colonic polyps. Benign polyps (n = 63), i.e., hyperplastic, inflammatory, and juvenile, had a similar fecal carrier rate as the normal control colons. Colons with polyps that are at increased risk for malignant degeneration (n = 62), i.e., tubulovillous and villous adenomas, and colons with carcinoma (n = 18), had a statistically significant increase (p less than 0.05) in the fecal carrier rate for S. bovis over the benign colon group. Overall, the incidence of S. bovis carriage in all colons with polyps was intermediary between normal colons and colons with carcinoma although the numbers did not achieve statistical significance.
TI  - Bacteriological methods for distinguishing between human and animal faecal pollution of water: results of fieldwork in Nigeria and Zimbabwe.
AB  - Bacteriological techniques have traditionally been used to detect faecal pollution of drinking water supplies. Recently, methods have been developed to distinguish between human and animal faecal pollution in temperate climates. The present study assessed the applicability and practicality of these methods in tropical countries. Fieldwork in Nigeria and Zimbabwe has shown that animal faecal pollution can reliably be identified by the detection and enumeration of Rhodococcus coprophilus using modified M3 agar, whereas human faecal contamination can be identified by the detection of sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria. Each of these organisms was detected only in the faeces of the type (human or animal) that it was meant to indicate. Although Streptococcus bovis has been used in the past in mainly temperate countries to distinguish animal from human faecal contamination, the present study has shown that this organism is not a reliable indicator of animal pollution in the tropics because it was excreted by a proportion of the human population in both Nigeria and Zimbabwe. Water sources known to be contaminated by human or animal excreta were examined for these indicator organisms. The results correlated with the results obtained from examining human and animal faecal specimens for these organisms. The role of these bacteriological methods in water pollution control programmes is discussed.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of a fluorescent antibody test for the serological diagnosis  of streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  - Serum fluorescent streptococcal antibody tests were carried out on 71 patients with clinically suspected infective endocarditis, and a final diagnosis of endocarditis was obtained in 46 patients. A serological diagnosis of streptococcal endocarditis was obtained in 10 patients who had persistently negative blood cultures, as fluorescent streptococcal antibody titres equal to or greater than 400 were detected against at least one of four strains of streptococci used as heterologous antigens. There were no false positive fluorescent antibody results with heterologous antigens during tests on 29 patients who had either non-streptococcal endocarditis, a final diagnosis other than endocarditis, or streptococcal sepsis not associated with endocarditis. A negative result with the heterologous antibody test could not, however, exclude a diagnosis of streptococcal endocarditis as six of 11 patients with endocarditis due to Streptococcus viridans or Str bovis confirmed on blood culture had serum fluorescent antibody titres less than 400 against all the heterologous streptococcal antigens tested. Homologous fluorescent streptococcal antibody titres equal to or greater than 400, using the patient's own blood culture isolate as the antigen, were found in the serum samples of 14 of 15 patients with endocarditis caused by viridans streptococci, three patients with enterococcal endocarditis, two patients with endocarditis caused by Str pneumoniae, and one patient with Str bovis endocarditis. In contrast, all five patients who had clinically insignificant streptococcal bacteraemias had serum fluorescent homologous antibody titres of only 100 or less. These results showed that the homologous serum fluorescent streptococcal antibody test could help to decide the clinical importance of a streptococcus which is initially isolated from only one or two of a number of inoculated blood culture bottles.
TI  - Mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  - Vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. It also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. There is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits ribonucleic acid synthesis. Induction of bacterial L-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. Stable L-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to vancomycin. Vancomycin is active against a large number of species of Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), Staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), Str. pyogenes, Str. agalactiae, Str. bovis, Str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, Clostridium species, diphtheroids, Listeria monocytogenes, Actinomyces species and Lactobacillus species. There has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. Enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against Staph. aureus, Str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. The combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of Staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of Staph. epidermidis. It shows indifference against enterococci. Vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against Staph. aureus.
TI  - Streptococci with dual antigen specificity for Lancefield groups D and G.
AB  - Streptococci have been isolated which may be identified in serological tests as belonging to Lancefield group G, but in fact belong to group D. Twenty-two cultures with this property were obtained from four countries; they included Streptococcus bovis and Streptococcus durans as well as Streptococcus faecalis. Selected strains were studied in serological tests and cross-absorption procedures, in which it was found that the group G reaction given by these isolates is due to an epitope with at least partial identity with reference group G antigen. Identification of an enterococcus as a group G streptococcus could lead to erroneous and ineffective chemotherapy. Antibiotic sensitivity testing of streptococcus group G isolates should be a routine procedure, and bile-aesculin and salt-tolerance testing of these isolates would be a wise precaution.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis subacute bacterial endocarditis as a presenting symptom of occult double carcinoma of the colon.
AB  - A case of double carcinoma of the colon is presented in association with subacute bacterial endocarditis due to Streptococcus bovis. The presence of Streptococcus bovis septicemia is a strong pointer in favour of associated colon carcinoma even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptomatology.
TI  - Changes in metabolism of the rumen bacterium Streptococcus bovis H13/1 resulting  from alteration in dilution rate and glucose supply per unit time.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis H13/1 was grown in a glucose-limited chemostat. A concomitant increase in dilution rate and glucose supply per unit time caused both an increase in lactate production per mole of glucose fermented and a linear increase in growth yield over the dilution rate range 0.052 to 0.141/h. When the dilution rate was increased with no change in glucose supply per unit time there was a reduction in lactate production and an increase in that of acetate and ethanol coinciding with a non-linear increase in growth yield. YMaxglu = 38.6 and a maintenance coefficient, ms = 0.290 mmol/l glucose/g cells/h were calculated. The results also suggested an interaction between the formate and CO2 pools.
TI  - Evaluation of a rapid latex agglutination test for identification of group D streptococci.
AB  - The SeroSTAT latex agglutination test (Scott Laboratories, Inc., Fiskesville, R.I.) for identification of group D streptococci was compared with bile-esculin agar and Lancefield grouping by using 110 clinical isolates of group D streptococci (S. faecalis, 74; S. bovis, 24; S. durans, 3; S. faecium, 9) and 65 viridans streptococci (S. anginosus-constellatus, 2; Streptococcus MG, 15; S. sanguis II, 14; S. mitis, 7; S. mutans, 5; S. salivarius, 8; S. sanguis I, 8; S. acidominimus, 1; S. morbillorum, 2; S. pneumoniae, 3). All strains of group D streptococci were bile-esculin positive. SeroSTAT reactions were falsely positive with 2 strains of S. sanguisII and 1 strain of Streptococcus MG (4.6% of all viridans streptococci tested) and falsely negative with 10 S. bovis, 8 S. faecalis, 1 S. durans, and 6 S. faecium strains (22.7% of all group D streptococci tested). When considered with colonial morphology and hemolytic reaction, SeroSTAT is a rapid (60-s) and useful test for recognition of group D streptococci.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis endocarditis and its association with colonic carcinoma.
AB  - Two cases of colonic carcinoma detected in patients with Streptococcus bovis endocarditis are presented. Neither patient had any complaints referable to the gastrointestinal tract; gastrointestinal evaluations were undertaken and colonic lesions were identified purely on the basis of the patients' underlying endocarditis. Both patients underwent successful surgery after completion of appropriate antibiotic treatment for S. bovis endocarditis. Results of a literature search for similar cases are presented. It is emphasized that all patients with S. bovis endocarditis should be evaluated for concomitant colonic carcinoma, even if they are totally asymptomatic.
TI  - Identification of Streptococcus bovis and Streptococcus salivarius in clinical laboratories.
AB  - Streptococci identified as Streptococcus bovis, S. bovis variant, and Streptococcus salivarius were examined with respect to physiological and serological characteristics and cellular fatty acid content. Similarities in physiological reactions and problems encountered in serological analysis were noted, suggesting that an expanded battery of physiological tests is needed to definitively identify these streptococci. Cellular fatty acid analysis provided an accurate method for distinguishing S. salivarius from S. bovis and S. bovis variant.
TI  - Efficacy of an iodine backflush for preventing new intramammary infections.
AB  - Efficacy of an iodine backflush system for reducing new intramammary infection was tested in two 11-wk trials. Forty cows in each trial were paired by breed, age, stage of lactation, and intramammary infection status. Each pair was assigned randomly either to a group milked with clusters that were reverse flushed with water, 25 ppm iodine, water and air or to a group milked with clusters receiving no backflush treatment between cows. Backflushing clusters reduced infections caused by Corynebacterium bovis and coagulase-positive staphylococci in both trials. However, backflushing clusters produced no clear advantage for reducing new infections with coagulase-negative staphylococci, Gram-negative bacilli, or streptococci (species other than Streptococcus agalactiae). No differences in somatic cell counts between experimental groups were observed. Teat cup liners and teat ends were swabbed after 120 and 1200 milkings/liner. Total microbial counts were significantly greater for liners that were not backflushed than from backflushed liners at each swabbing. However, no differences were significant between groups for mean teat end microbial counts in either trial.
TI  - Compositions and characteristics of strains of Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis strains JB1, 26, 581AXY2, 21096C, and 45S1 grew on glucose, maltose, starch, sucrose, cellobiose, and lactose. None of these strains grew on xylose or ribose, but arabinose was a suitable energy source for strains 2109C and K27FF4. All strains grew at 45 degrees C, but incubation at 50 degrees C prevented growth. Growth was permitted in 2% sodium chloride, but 6.5% sodium chloride was inhibitory. Doubling times ranged from 24 to 27 min, and final pH on glucose was approximately 4.6. None of the strains had a requirement for amino acids, and growth was rapid in media containing glucose salts and B vitamins. There was no ammonia production from arginine. All strains showed aminoendopeptidase activity, but there was considerable strain variation. Strain 7H4, reported as Streptococcus bovis, was noticeably different from the other six strains. It had a doubling time that was more than four times as long, and it grew poorly on starch or in the absence of an amino acid source. Six-and-a-half percent sodium chloride was not inhibitory, and it produced ammonia from arginine. Cell morphology was coccoid rather than ovoid. Based on these criteria, classification of strain 7H4 as Streptococcus bovis seemed doubtful. Other experiments with strain 7H4 indicated that Streptococcus bovis was devoid of diaminopimelic acid. In these experiments strain 7H4 contained significant diaminopimelic acid. The six Streptococcus bovis strains all contained diaminopimelic acid as well, but concentration varied.
TI  - A note on the pectinolytic enzyme of Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - A pectinolytic strain of Streptococcus bovis isolated from the bovine rumen produced an endopolygalacturonate lyase (EC 4.2.2.2). The principal decomposition products of pectin were unsaturated methyl tetra- and tri-galacturonates.
TI  - Effect of media and blood on the antimicrobial activity of cephalosporins on serogroup D streptococci: a review.
AB  - The influence of culture medium on in vitro of selected cephalosporins on on group D streptococci was investigated by agar diffusion and broth dilution methods. The activity of cephalothin, cefamandole, and cefoperazone were not substantially influenced by the type of culture medium used, but cefuroxime, ceftizoxime, cefotaxime (CTX), cefmenoxime, and ceftriaxone varied markedly with both the commercial brand and the blood content of the broth used. The differences were more likely to occur in some Mueller-Hinton media, particularly when supplemented with 5% lysed sheep blood, and resulted in susceptible results instead of the resistant results that were obtained with these same media without blood. Some strains of Streptococcus faecalis showed these discrepancies, but S. bovis did not. The influence of the media on in vitro activity suggests a complex interaction between some cephalosporins, media components, and organisms. The cephalosporins that were affected by media share an identical moiety at the 7-acyl position (cefuroxime is slightly different); this structure is not shared by those cephalosporins that were not affected, however. It is possible that this structure may play a part in the phenomenon.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis endocarditis with carcinoma of the colon.
AB  
TI  - [Endocarditis due to group D Streptococcus (S. bovis and S. faecalis) and tumor of the colon. Report of 2 cases].
AB  
TI  - Behaviour of Campylobacter sputorum subspecies mucosalis in gnotobiotic pigs.
AB  - Gnotobiotic pigs were dosed orally with Campylobacter sputorum subspecies mucosalis, either alone, or combined with rotavirus or non-pathogenic Escherichia coli and Streptococcus bovis to study the behaviour of C s mucosalis in defined conditions, to assess intracellular parasitism of enterocytes by C s mucosalis, and if possible to establish an experimental model of porcine intestinal adenomatosis. C s mucosalis colonised the gut of gnotobiotic pigs, persisting for up to 47 days after infection, but did not induce adenomatosis. Despite evidence of limited penetration of the mucosa up to two days after infection, the majority of C s mucosalis remained in the gut lumen. Rotavirus did not enhance invasion of enterocytes by C s mucosalis. The presence of E coli and S bovis caused an increase in the total numbers of C s mucosalis in the gut, but did not affect their distribution. Thus C s mucosalis was largely non-pathogenic in gnotobiotic pigs.
TI  - Isolation and identification of adherent epimural bacteria during succession in young lambs.
AB  - Successive changes in aerobic and anaerobic bacterial counts and changes in the generic composition of the epimural community in lambs from 1 to 10 weeks were determined. Bacterial culture counts revealed a predominantly anaerobic community, with the mean anaerobic count being 1.4 X 10(7) CFU/cm2 of tissue surface. The aerobic count was highest at 1 week of age and declined significantly thereafter to a mean of 1.8 X 10(4) CFU/cm2, thus representing only 0.13% of the mean anaerobic count after week 1. Of the 345 strains isolated anaerobically at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks of age, 47, 32, 12, 32, 2, and 5% were capable of growth in a partially reduced medium, indicating a reduction in the number of facultative anaerobes with time. The majority of isolated strains were identified as belonging to genera commonly isolated from rumen contents. In some instances, however, strains did not correspond to previously described species, and some genera were present in proportions different from those expected in rumen fluid. At three of the sampling times, one genus was dominant, constituting 45 to 55% of the isolates. These dominant isolates were Streptococcus bovis, Bacteroides sp., and an anaerobic Streptococcus sp. for weeks 1, 2, and 10, respectively. During the transition period (weeks 4 to 8), two or more groups were codominant.
TI  - The uptake and utilization of Entodinium caudatum, bacteria, free amino acids and glucose by the rumen ciliate Entodinium bursa.
AB  - Washed suspensions of Entodinium bursa were incubated anaerobically with Entodinium caudatum, ten species of bacteria and a yeast. The rate of uptake and digestion of these micro-organisms was investigated. Protozoa grown in vivo did not engulf Proteus mirabilis or Klebsiella aerogenes but rapidly took up Bacillus megaterium. Selenomonas ruminantium, Torulopsis glabrata and Streptococcus bovis, although only the last was digested with release of soluble material into the medium. Protozoa grown in vitro engulfed each of the bacteria tested, taking up Megasphaera elsdenii and Proteus mirabilis most rapidly. Individual bacterial species and mixed rumen bacteria were engulfed more rapidly (up to 20 times) by protozoa grown in vivo than those grown in vitro, although the latter digested over 80% of the B. megaterium, Escherichia coli and P. mirabilis taken up. Labelled Ent. caudatum was extensively digested after engulfment by Ent. bursa. Some of the digestion products were released into the medium but individual amino acids were transferred as such from Ent. caudatum protein to Ent. bursa protein. Engulfed bacteria and polysaccharide granules were transferred intact from one protozoon to the other. Free amino acids were also taken up intact from the medium into protozoal protein but there was little biosynthesis of amino acids from glucose. When available for engulfment Ent. caudatum was quantitatively a much more valuable source of amino acids for protein synthesis by Ent. bursa than free amino acids or bacteria.
TI  - The susceptibility of bovine udder quarters colonized with Corynebacterium bovis  to experimental infection with Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - Twenty bovine udder quarters colonized with Corynebacterium bovis SR6 and 20 uncolonized quarters were challenged by inoculation of Staphylococcus aureus Newbould 305 (ATCC 29740) into the teat cistern. The percentage of infection in quarters colonized with C. bovis (50%) was significantly lower than that in controls (100%). By similar challenge no significant difference was observed between the percentage of infection with Streptococcus agalactiae ATCC 27956 in 33 quarters colonized with C. bovis (70%) compared to 33 controls (87.9%). A total of 37 quarters colonized with C. bovis and 37 control quarters were challenged with Staph. aureus Newbould 305 (ATCC 29740) and Maxi (ATCC 27543) and Strep. agalactiae (ATCC 27956) by exposure of the teat orifice. The percentage of teat ducts colonized with C. bovis which became infected with either pathogen was not different from that for controls.
TI  - Relationship between the level of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase) in bovine milk and the presence of mastitis pathogens.
AB  - Changes in the level of the tissue damage marker enzyme, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase) in quarter fore milks were found to be related to the presence and types of pathogenic bacteria present and to somatic cell counts (SCC). Minor pathogens (coagulase-negative staphylococci, Corynebacterium bovis) elicited a mild SCC increase (from a mean of 243 X 10(3)/ml in healthy quarters to 504 X 10(3)/ml in infected quarters) with marginal tissue damage (mean NAGase activity increased from 21 in healthy quarters to 28 in infected quarters). Major pathogens (i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Str. dysgalactiae and Str. uberis) caused more severe tissue damage (mean NAGase of 48) and SCC increases (mean, 2803 X 10(3)/ml). The NAGase test could also be used effectively on composite milk samples where regular monthly NAGase analysis was able to identify correctly 74% of animals having infected quarters. The possibility of combining SCC and NAGase data in order to give a more definite diagnosis of bovine mastitis is discussed.
TI  - A note on a modified membrane-Bovis agar for the enumeration of Streptococcus bovis by membrane filtration.
AB  - A modified membrane-Bovis agar, containing a reduced quantity of sodium azide, for the isolation and enumeration of Streptococcus bovis is described and evaluated. Higher counts, with larger colonies, were obtained from water and sewage samples with this medium than with the original formulation.
TI  - Evaluation of the API 20 Strep system for species identification of streptococci  isolated from bovine mastitis.
AB  - A new commercial system (API 20 Strep) for the species identification of streptococci associated with bovine mastitis was compared with the conventional biochemical methods. A total of 84 strains, including Streptococcus agalactiae (13), S. dysgalactiae (16), S. uberis (24), S. faecalis (12), S. faecium (5), and S. bovis (14) were tested. Using profile index and table data issued by the manufacturer, we identified 71.4% of strains by the API 20 Strep system. Our results indicate that improvement of the identification key is needed for accurate identification of streptococci isolated from bovine mastitis.
TI  - The intestinal microflora of infants: composition of fecal flora in breast-fed and bottle-fed infants.
AB  - The fecal flora of 35 breast-fed and 35 bottle-fed babies was determined. Bifidobacteria were the predominant fecal bacteria in both groups. Conversely, the counts of most of the other bacteria, such as bacteroides, eubacteria, peptococci, veillonella, clostridia, enterobacteria, streptococci, and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. The frequencies of occurrence of lecithinase positive clostridia, clostridia-others, pseudomonas and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. Twenty-one genera and 103 species or biovars of microorganisms were isolated from the feces of the breast-fed group and 20 genera and 97 species or biovars from the bottle-fed group. The organism that showed the highest number and the highest frequency of occurrence in both groups was Bifidobacterium breve. Bifidobacterium infantis, which was formerly the most prevalent Bifidobacterium species in baby feces, was never isolated in this study. Further, the counts and incidences of Clostridium paraputrificum, C. perfringens, and Bacillus subtilis, the counts of C. clostridiiforme, Bacteroides vulgatus, Veillonella parvula, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus bovis, S. faecalis, and S. faecium and the incidences of C. difficile, C. tertium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the bottle-fed infants were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed infants.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of Streptococcus bovis to six antibiotics.
AB  - A recent report of two isolates of Streptococcus bovis resistant to killing by low levels of penicillin G prompted this study of the in vitro susceptibility of 100 clinical isolates of S bovis to six antibiotics. Using a microdilution method, we found the minimum bactericidal concentrations for 99% of the isolates to be as follows: penicillin G, 0.5 microgram/ml; methicillin, 16 micrograms/ml; ampicillin, 0.5 microgram/ml; cephalothin, 2 micrograms/ml; clindamycin, 2 micrograms/ml; and vancomycin, 2 micrograms/ml. The high-level resistance of S bovis to penicillin G previously described was not seen. This study suggests that penicillin G can still prove effective in treating most infections caused by S bovis, including infective endocarditis, and that cephalothin and vancomycin are useful alternative agents.
TI  - Measurement of microbial alpha-amylases with p-nitrophenyl glycosides as the substrate complex.
AB  - The detection of alpha-amylase is commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories to aid in differentiating Streptococcus bovis from other streptococci. It is also useful in identifying Eikenella corrodens and the gravis subspecies of Corynebacterium diphtheriae and in separating species of the genera Bacteroides, Clostridium, Actinomyces, and Bacillus. Currently, the most frequently used procedure utilizes starch as the substrate and iodine as the indicator. Starch is incorporated into a agar medium, the isolate is inoculated on the surface, and the medium is incubated for 24 to 48 h. A 15-min test containing p-nitrophenyl polyglycosides as the substrate complex was developed to yield results comparable with the agar-based starch test. The reagent was made in liquid form, 0.20 ml per tube, and could be incubated either in ambient air or at 35 degrees C. When dried, the p-nitrophenyl polyglycoside reagent could be stored at 0 degrees C for 4 weeks.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis bacteremia and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
AB  
TI  - Streptococcus bovis septicemia and meningitis associated with chronic radiation enterocolitis.
AB  - We describe the first patient with simultaneous S bovis septicemia and meningitis associated with chronic radiation enterocolitis. This case underlines the value of a thorough gastrointestinal evaluation of all patients with S bovis infection, and the need for a neurologic investigation even with minor neurologic manifestations.
TI  - Splenic abscess associated with Streptococcus bovis septicemia and neoplastic lesions of the colon.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis bacteremia is known to be associated with gastrointestinal disease, especially colon lesions. Two patients are presented with a previously unreported syndrome: S. bovis bacteremia, endocarditis, colon neoplasms, and splenic abscess. In one case, the colonic lesion was occult and required colonoscopy for identification (normal barium enema). S. bovis bacteremia is an important marker for occult gastrointestinal neoplasia.
TI  - Endocarditis due to a penicillin-tolerant streptococcus bovis: microbiological findings and echocardiographic follow-up.
AB  - We are presenting a case of endocarditis due to a penicillin-tolerant Streptococcus bovis in a 65-year-old patient. The minimal bactericidal concentration of penicillin (40 mg/l) was more than 100-fold the minimal inhibitory concentration (0.08 mg/l). The MBC of penicillin was 0.31 mg/l in the presence of 1.25 mg/l gentamicin. Cross-sectional echocardiography revealed endocarditis of the anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve and a vegetation on the aortic valve which appeared to be pedunculated and which prolapsed into the left ventricular outflow tract during diastole. During therapy, the pedunculated part of the vegetation disappeared without signs of embolization. After initial clinical improvement, the patient died of cerebral bleeding caused by a mycotic aneurysm of the left median cerebral artery. The patient's final outcome suggested an asymptomatic embolus. Cross-sectional echocardiography was distinctly superior to M-mode echocardiography in estimating changes in the size and shape of the valve vegetation. The results of the post-mortem examination of the aortic and tricuspid valves corresponded to the echocardiographic findings.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis endocarditis and colonic polyp.
AB  
TI  - Rapid identification of enterococci.
AB  - A 4-h method was devised to differentiate the non-beta-hemolytic streptococci into three categories: enterococci, group D nonenterococci, and viridans streptococci. All of the Streptococcus faecalis, 90% of the Streptococcus faecium (enterococci), and 96% of the Streptococcus bovis biotype I (group D nonenterococci) cultures were correctly identified by the 4-h method. The less commonly isolated group D cultures had lower rates of correct identification by this method. None of the viridans streptococci was identified incorrectly.
TI  - Relation of rumen ATP concentration to bacterial and protozoal numbers.
AB  - Cultures of Streptococcus bovis and mixed populations of rumen bacteria were used to investigate the concentration of ATP and rumen bacterial numbers at various stages of growth. ATP, extracted with Tris buffer, was analyzed using the firefly luciferin-luciferase bioluminescent reaction. ATP concentrations of S. bovis and mixed cultures of rumen bacteria significantly correlated with live cell counts during the log phase of growth but not during the stationary phase. The average cellular ATP concentration of rumen bacteria was calculated to be 0.3 fg of ATP per cell. Studies done with in vivo artificial rumen apparatus revealed that the protozoal contribution to rumen fluid ATP pool size was much more substantial than was the bacterial contribution. The rumen fluid ATP concentration was greater in cattle with protozoa than in those that were defaunated. Differences in ATP concentration due to size differences of ciliate protozoa were observed. Due to the unbalanced distribution of ATP in rumen microbes, ATP appears to be an unsuitable indicator of rumen microbial biomass.
TI  - Humoral reactions in human endocarditis due to Streptococcus bovis: evidence for  a common S bovis antigen.
AB  - Humoral reactions to native culture filtrates of Streptococcus bovis were studied in patients with endocarditis by means of two-dimensional crossed immunoelectrophoresis. Serum from patients with S bovis endocarditis produced eight different precipitin arcs. Lex antigen cross-reacted with sera from patients with viridans streptococcal endocarditis, and TA antigen cross-reacted with ribitol teichoic acid-positive sera from patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. One antigen, common (c), was immunoreactive with all 10 sera from S bovis-infected patients. Antibody to this antigen was not found in sera from 77 patients with gram-positive bacteremia or in 29 other control sera. Common (c) antigen was found in all strains of S bovis isolated from patients. Rabbits immunized with formalinized S bovis cells of human origin also produced antibody to common (c) antigen. Common (c) may be an important antigen of S bovis and may in fact define this organism serologically.
TI  - Streptococci isolated from the bloodstream and gingival crevice of man.
AB  - One hundred and twenty six strains of streptococci isolated from the bloodstreams of 123 hospital in-patients--55 with endocarditis--and 255 strains isolated from the gingival crevices of 66 volunteers were characterised. Species isolated were Streptococcus mitior, S. sanguis, undifferentiated viridans streptococci, S. salivarius, S. milleri, S. mutans, S. bovis and S. faecalis. There was no significant difference between the distribution of species in blood and in the gingival crevice. S. mitior and S. sanguis were found less frequently in blood than their presence in the gingival crevice would have suggested, whereas S. milleri was found more frequently. This may indicate that S. milleri is more invasive or that it enters the bloodstream from sources other than the gingival crevice.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis endocarditis and colonic carcinoma: a neglected association.
AB  
TI  - Isolation of proteolytic rumen bacteria by use of selective medium containing leaf fraction 1 protein (ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase).
AB  - The principle proteolytic bacteria isolated from bovine rumen contents by virtue  of the ability to obtain nitrogen from the proteolysis of leaf fraction 1 protein (ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase, EC 4.1.1.39) were identified as Streptococcus bovis and Butyrivibrio spp. Substitution of fresh fodder, rich in soluble protein, for a hay-concentrates diet resulted in enhanced ruminal proteolytic activity and a significant increase in the number of bacteria able to use fraction 1 protein as the sole nitrogen source. Isolated proteolytic bacteria degraded fraction 1 protein and casein readily. Bovine serum albumin was attacked by Butyrivibrio spp. but was resistant to proteolysis by the streptococci.
TI  - Rapid identification of group D streptococci with the API 20S system.
AB  - The API 20S system (Analytab Products) was evaluated as a means of identifying 209 isolates of Lancefield group D streptococci to the species level. Results were compared with those from a conventional tube biochemical identification system and from serological grouping. Use of the latest 20S computerized data base allowed species identification of 97% (203 of 209) of test isolates after a 4-h incubation period and 99% (208 of 209) of test isolates if supplemental overnight biochemical tests were used to clarify the identity of five Streptococcus bovis-variant isolates. The API 20S system appears to be a convenient and accurate method for rapid, same-day species identification of group D streptococci.
TI  - Germicidal teat dip in a herd with low prevalence of Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus mastitis.
AB  - Effectiveness of an iodophor teat dip in reducing new intramammary infection and  clinical mastitis was tested in a herd free of Streptococcus agalactiae and with a low prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus infections. In this 6-mo study with an average of 152 lactating cows on trial on sampling dates, right rear and left front teats were dipped after each milking while right front and left rear teats were undipped controls. Teat dipping significantly reduced new infections by Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci (other than Streptococcus agalactiae), coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Corynebacterium bovis and reduced clinical cases caused by infections established during the trial. However, the dip did not reduce new infections or clinical mastitis caused by coliform bacteria. Therefore, use of a germicidal dip is recommended for herds with a low prevalence of Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus, but the practice should not be expected to control coliform mastitis.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of norfloxacin against urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - The in vitro activity of norfloxacin (MK366) against 477 aerobic gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates was compared to that of nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, ampicillin, cephalexin, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and the combination trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Norfloxacin was more active than the other agents against all gram-negative organisms tested. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were less than or equal to 0.125-32 mg/l with 90% inhibited (MIC90) by 4 mg/l; MICs of the Enterobacteriaceae including Serratia marcescens were less than or equal to 0.125-8 mg/l with an MIC90 of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. There was also excellent activity against the gram-positive cocci including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and the enterococci, with MICs less than or equal to 0.125-4 mg/l and an MIC90 less than or equal to 4 mg/l. Only 8 of 477 organisms were norfloxacin-resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 16 mg/l): 3 of 100 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 3 of 10 Pseudomonas maltophilia and 2 of 15 Streptococcus bovis strains. In contrast, 97% of the gram-positive cocci and 49% of the gram-negative bacilli were nalidixic acid-resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 32 mg/l). Norfloxacin shows excellent activity against a wide range of bacteria and merits further study as a urinary antibacterial agent.
TI  - Intramammary infections in primigravid heifers near parturition.
AB  - Mammary secretion from 32 primigravid heifers was obtained aseptically to determine frequency of bacterial isolation and incidence of intramammary infection near parturition. Quarter samples were collected 14 and 7 days prior to expected parturition, at parturition, and 7 and 14 days postparturition. Analysis of culture data indicated that 77.1% of samples were bacteriologically negative, and 15.7% contained coagulase negative staphylococci, 4.4% streptococci other than Streptococcus agalactiae, 3.8% coliforms, .8% coagulase positive staphylococci, and .1% Corynebacterium bovis. Frequency of bacterial isolation was highest in samples obtained prior to and at parturition. Thirty-five of 128 quarters were infected at parturition. Twenty-six of the 35 infections were caused by coagulase negative staphylococci, 4 by streptococci other than Streptococcus agalactiae, 4 by coliforms, and 1 by coagulase positive staphylococci. Twenty infections were observed during the early postpartum period. Coagulase negative staphylococcal infections decreased markedly. However, the number and type of primary pathogen infections during early lactation were similar to those at parturition.
TI  - Susceptibility of bovine mammary gland to infections during the dry period.
AB  - Quarter foremilk samples (1,574) were collected for bacteriological analysis from 40 cows during late lactation, early involution, prior to parturition, parturition, and during early lactation. Six of 160 quarters were infected with major pathogens during late lactation. Twelve new infections occurred during early involution. Twenty-two quarters were infected at parturition. Of these infections, 12 occurred after early involution, and 10 infections that originated during early involution persisted throughout the dry period. During early lactation, 21 major pathogen infections were observed. Nine occurred after calving, and 12 persisted from parturition. Most major pathogen infections (93.8%) were caused by coliforms and streptococcal species other than Streptococcus agalactiae. Numbers of streptococcal infections were highest at parturition and early lactation. Numbers of quarters infected with coliforms were similar during early involution, parturition, and early lactation. Coagulase negative staphylococcal infections increased during the dry period, whereas Corynebacterium bovis infected quarters decreased. Udder infections were few in cows completing first or second dry periods. The incidence of udder infection was highest in cows completing third or later dry periods.
TI  - Within herd comparison of teat dipping and dry cow therapy with only selective dry cow therapy in six herds.
AB  - A within herd comparison of teat dipping and dry cow therapy (full treatment) with only selective dry cow therapy (partial treatment) was carried out in six commercial dairy herds for a two year period. In four herds, the incidence of clinical mastitis was 2 to 12 per cent higher in the partial treatment group. In another herd, in which the pattern of clinical mastitis isolates was unusual in that minor pathogens were isolated from 30 per cent of mastitis cases, the incidence was 43 per cent higher in the partial treatment group. In the remaining herd the incidence was 10 percent higher in the full treatment group. Streptococcus uberis mastitis was more common in the partial treatment groups of five herds; coliform mastitis was more common in the full treatment groups of two herds and similar in both groups in the other herds. High rates of coliform mastitis were associated with poor herd environmental conditions but this was not true for Strep uberis mastitis. Rates of staphylococcus aureus and Strep dysgalactiae mastitis were low in all herds. The level of major pathogen infection in cows completing the trial in all herds increased in the partial treatment group from 5 per cent of quarters at the start to 12 per cent at the finish of the trial. In the full treatment group, however, there was only a small increase in this level. In contrast, levels of Corynebacterium bovis infection increased by 17 per cent in both treatment groups. Continued use of teat dipping and dry cow therapy was associated with a higher rate of coliform mastitis in two of the three herds where there were poor standards of hygiene and husbandry.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - The growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. fecalis, S. sanguis, S. bovis, S. mitior, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli, A-D group, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Pasteurella multocida or Listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. Two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. The analysis detected the growth of S. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and species of Micrococcus, Corynebacterium or Bacillus in 18 blood cultures.
TI  - Association of Streptococcus bovis bacteremia with bowel disease.
AB  - We reviewed the medical records of 19 patients who had Streptococcus bovis bacteremia. Eight patients had diverticulosis, four had benign adenomatous colonic polyps, and three had adenocarcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract. Laboratory workers and clinicians should be aware of the association of S. bovis bacteremia and gastrointestinal disease.
TI  - Cephapirin therapy in infective endocarditis.
AB  - Ten patients, eight of them heroin addicts, with infective endocarditis were treated with cephapirin. Causative organisms included Staphylococcus aureus in six patients and viridans streptococci, S bovis, and S pneumoniae in one patient each. In one of the patients with endocarditis, both S aureus and an organism of the beta-Streptococcus group were simultaneously isolated. All patients except two, both with monomicrobial S aureus endocarditis, were cured. All isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml of cephapirin. Peak serum bactericidal activity greater than or equal to 32 times the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the causative organism was achieved in all cases after giving 2 gm IV every four hours. After using large inoculums of staphylococci for in vitro tests, we found that twofold to eightfold increases in MIC occurred. Cephapirin was well tolerated intravenously and high levels in serum were achieved without toxicity or accumulation of the drug.
TI  - Asymptomatic colonic carcinoma revealed by investigation of Streptococcus bovis bacteremia.
AB  - A case of bacteremia in a patient with a prosthetic aortic valve is reported. The identification of streptococcus bovis as the causative organism and its known association with gastrointestinal disease led to investigations which revealed carcinoma of the sigmoid colon in an asymptomatic patient. The association of colonic lesions with S. bovis bacteremia is briefly reviewed.
TI  - Purification and properties of pyruvate kinase from Streptococcus sanguis and activator specificity of pyruvate kinase from oral streptococci.
AB  - It was found that pyruvate kinases with two different regulatory characteristics  were distributed among oral streptococci. The pyruvate kinases of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, and Streptococcus bovis were activated by glucose 6-phosphate, whereas the enzymes of both Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mitis were activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. Pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) from S. sanguis NCTC 10904 was purified, giving a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme had a molecular weight of 250,000 to 260,000 and consisted of four identical subunits. Whereas the pyruvate kinase from S. mutans was completely dependent on glucose 6-phosphate (K. Abbe and T. Yamada, J. Bacteriol. 149:299-305, 1982), the enzyme from S. sanguis was activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. In the presence of 0.5 mM fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, the saturation curves for the substrates, phosphoenolpyruvate and ADP, were hyperbolic, and the Km values were 0.13 and 0.30 mM, respectively. Without fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, however, saturation curves for both substrates were sigmoidal. GDP, IDP, and UDP could replace ADP. Like the enzyme from S. mutans, the enzyme from S. sanguis required a divalent cation, Mg2+ or Mn2+, and a monovalent cation, K+ or NH4+, for activity, and it was strongly inhibited by Pi. When the concentration of Pi was increased, the half-saturating concentration and Hill coefficient for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate increased. The remarkable fluctuation of intracellular levels of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate observed in the cells growing under glucose limitation and nitrogen limitation implies that the intracellular concentration of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, in cooperation with that of Pi, may regulate pyruvate kinase activity in S. sanguis in vivo.
TI  - Carcinoma of the colon 2 years after endocarditis due to Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - A patient with Streptococcus bovis endocarditis, on complete gastrointestinal evaluation had only an adenomatous polyp of the sigmoid colon. Twenty-eight months later she was found to have invasive cecal carcinoma. Periodic evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract is therefore recommended for all patients with a history of S. bovis septicemia.
TI  - Studies on the mechanism of intrinsic resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in group D streptococci.
AB  - Six penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) were detected in clinical isolates of each one of three group D streptococci: Streptococcus bovis, S. faecalis and S. faecium. When examined in whole organisms, the PBPs of S. faecium, the most penicillin-resistant species of group D streptococci, generally had lower affinities for the antibiotic than those of S. faecalis (intermediate penicillin resistance), which in turn were of lower affinity than those of S. bovis (penicillin-sensitive). On the other hand, no quantitative correlation could be established between the binding of penicillin to any one PBP or group of PBPs, and the penicillin MIC value for the corresponding micro-organism. Examination of the amounts of antibiotic bound and the rates of binding to PBPs of equal numbers of protoplasts and whole bacteria of S. faecalis and S. faecium, indicated that there was no permeability barrier to benzylpenicillin in the cell walls of these species. The lower antibacterial effectiveness of cephalothin compared with ampicillin in group D streptococci was paralleled by the higher concentrations of cephalothin needed in competition assays to inhibit the lower molecular size PBPs of these bacteria.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Streptococcus.
AB  - A numerical taxonomic study of strains of Streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. The major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (S. faecalis, S. faecium, 'S. avium' and a proposed new species 'S. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (S. bovis, S. equinus, S. salivarius, 'S. casseliflavus', S. mutans, S. raffinolactis and an unidentified Oral Group I); (c) lactic species group (S. lactis including S. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (S. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (S. mitis, S. sanguis, a proposed new species 'S. oralis' and 'S. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. equi, 'S. equisimilis' including 'S. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of Lancefield Group B strains of human origin); (g) parapyogenic species group (S. uberis, 'S. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of Lancefield Groups R, S and T). Species of Aerococcus, Gemella, Leuconostoc and Pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
TI  - Fluorogenic selective and differential medium for isolation of fecal streptococci.
AB  - Of 44 fluorogenic substrates tested for their ability to differentiate species of fecal streptococci, four yielded species-differentiating reactions. The remaining substrates either yielded uniformly positive, negative, or variable strain-dependent reactions. One substrate, 4-methylumbelliferone-alpha-D-galactoside, was hydrolyzed by Streptococcus bovis and S. faecium and its biotypes. 4-Methylumbelliferone-alpha-D-galactoside and a colorimetric starch substrate were incorporated into the fecal streptococcal selective medium of Donnelly and Hartman (Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 35:576-581, 1978). Three phenotypic groups were identifiable on the new fluorescent gentamicin-thallous-carbonate agar: (i) starch hydrolysis and fluorescence (S. bovis), (ii) no starch hydrolysis but fluorescence (S. faecium and its biotypes), and (iii) no starch hydrolysis or fluorescence (S. faecalis, S. avium, S. equinus, S. mitis, and S. salivarius). Of the presumptive identifications from sewage, swine, and bovine samples, 86% were confirmed as being correct. The new medium has potential application in water, food, environmental, and possibly clinical microbiology.
TI  - The clinical significance of streptococcal species isolated from cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - Alpha-hemolytic (viridans) streptococci are often isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); however, the significance of such isolates is poorly understood. In order to clarify the clinical significance of isolating these organisms from CSF, we did a retrospective analysis of 43 patients, from whom eight different species of alpha-hemolytic streptococci were recovered. Eight patients (19%) had significant infections based on bacteriologic, laboratory, and clinical findings. Significant infections were associated with S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. intermedius, S. faecalis, and S. bovis. Thirty-five patient isolates (81%) from CSF were considered as contaminants, with S. mitis being the most frequently isolated organism (49%). Direct gram stain of CSF sediment, CSF glucose concentration, and CSF cell differential were clearly abnormal in most patients with significant infections, in contrast to patients with streptococci isolated as contaminants. Cultures of the lumbar puncture skin site yielded streptococci and other bacteria, suggesting a possible reservoir for contaminants.
TI  - Detection and partial characterization of antibacterial factor(s) in alveolar lining material of rats.
AB  - Intracellular killing of Staphylococcus aureus by alveolar macrophages is known to be enhanced by exposure to alveolar lining material. Because this material may have a role in pulmonary host defenses, we have studied its effect on pneumococci and other nonstaphylococcal organisms. Alveolar lining material from rats caused rapid killing and lysis of pneumococci. The antipneumococcal activity was localized to the surfactant-containing fraction of the fluid and was not affected by trypsin. Phospholipid extracts of the surfactant fraction or purified lamellar bodies killed pneumococci. Lysis of pneumococci by the surfactant fraction appeared to be mediated by a detergent-like activation of pneumococcal autolysin, in that bacteriolysis was prevented by substitution of ethanolamine for choline in pneumococcal cell walls, and a pneumococcal transformant that lacked autolysin was not lysed. The surfactant fraction readily killed pneumococci containing ethanolamine or the autolysin-defective transformant, and studies with tritiated methyl-D-glucose loading and release showed that killing was associated with increased bacterial cell membrane permeability. Bactericidal activity (without lysis) was observed with several nonpneumococcal gram-positive bacteria, including Streptococcus viridans, unspeciated respiratory streptococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus bovis, and Bacillus species. Purified diacylphospholipids had no antibacterial activity, however, a lysophospholipid, palmitoyl lysophosphatidylcholine, had many properties resembling the surfactant-containing fraction of lavage, including autolysin-mediated pneumococcal lysis, altered cell membrane permeability, and antibacterial activity against several gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - The ecology of the streptococci.
AB  - All species of streptococci are divided into several groups according to the ecological niches they occupy. Members of the lactic acid group are found only in the plant environment and the dairy. Members of the pyogenic group and the buccal and intestinal residents of the subthermophilic group are found in intimate association only with homeothermic hosts. Members of the virulent pyogenic group, such asStreptococcus pyogenes, S. equi, andS. infrequens, are restricted to single hosts-the human, the horse, and the pig-whereas others, such asS. agalactiae can be found in several hosts. The intestinal dwellers of the subthermophilic group,S. bovis andS. equinus, occur in several animal species and are not isolated from other sources. The superficially homogeneousS. faecalis of the "enteric" group may actually consist of a group specifically restricted to the human host, and of a second group distributed among wild animals, insects, and plants. The latter group differs from the human type by the ability to hydrolyze starch and to produce a rennin-proteolytic type of curd in milk.Streptococcus faecium is widely distributed in both the homeothermic and poikilothermic environments, but no properties which differentiate the sources are known.Streptococcus faecium biot.casseliflavus has been isolated only from insects and plants.Streptococcus uberis occurs on the bovine lips and skin. Unidentified streptococci from all environments vary widely in properties. Many resembleS. lactis, S. faecalis, andS. faecium.
TI  - Dynamics of nonclinical bovine intramammary infections with major and minor pathogens.
AB  - Udder infections were recorded in 3 herds throughout a lactation period with bacteriologic examination being done at 3-week intervals. New infection rates and levels of infection at calving differed significantly (P less than 0.001) between herds, but persistence of infection did not. Of the 324 infections, 80.5% lasted up to drying off. Of quarters infected with major pathogens, 16.8% eliminated their infection (63% became reinfected); 20.8% of quarters infected with minor pathogens eliminated their infection (43% became reinfected). Significant differences in persistence of infections, quarter clearing rate (defined as the rate at which infected quarters become and remain noninfected) and ability to give way to and to take place of a preexistent infection, did not occur between Corynebacterium bovis and major pathogens. Though 66% of coagulase-negative staphylococci infections persisted up to drying off, they disappeared more frequently (P less than 0.01).
TI  - Conversion of amoscanate to a mutagenic metabolite in gnotobiotic mice implanted  with Streptococcus equinus.
AB  - Recent in vitro studies indicate that intestinal bacteria convert amoscanate (4-nitro-4'-isothiocyanodiphenylamine), an antischistosomal drug, to a potent mutagen. The present study indicates that the implantation of germfree mice with Streptococcus equinus, isolated from the small intestine of conventional mice, restores the mutagenic activation of amoscanate in vivo.
TI  - Circulating antibodies after experimental chronic infection in the root canal of  teeth in monkeys.
AB  - Root canals of 49 teeth with necrotic pulp tissue in five monkeys were infected with Streptococcus faecalis ss liquefaciens, Actinomyces bovis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Bacteroides oralis in various combinations. After 6 months the root canals and the periapical tissues were subjected to radiographic, bacteriologic, and histologic examinations. Signs of periapical inflammation were radiographically registered in 41 teeth, most frequently in teeth inoculated with a mixed flora. In 11 out of 16 teeth infected separately with Strep. faecalis ss liquefaciens, apical periodontitis was observed. Sera from the monkeys prior to and after the experimental inoculation were analyzed by means of gel diffusion, hemagglutination (HA), and complement binding test for antibodies against different antigen preparations of the homologous bacterial strains used for the inoculation. Detectable antibodies were seen with antigens of B. oralis in all five monkeys. Agglutinating antibodies were demonstrated with lipopolysaccharide-antigen of B. oralis in titers between 1:40 and 1:320. A marked reduction of the antibody level against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigen after mercaptoethanol treatment indicated that a main part of the antibodies registered was of IgM-class. The study shows that certain antigens of bacterial origin from infected root canals, while affecting the periapical tissues, also stimulate the production of circulating antibodies.

TI  - Influence of plant phenolic acids on growth and cellulolytic activity of rumen bacteria.
AB  - Isolated rumen bacteria were examined for growth and, where appropriate, for their ability to degrade cellulose in the presence of the hydroxycinnamic acids trans-p-coumaric acid and trans-ferulic acid and the hydroxybenzoic acids vanillic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid. Ferulic and p-coumaric acids proved to be the most toxic of the acids examined and suppressed the growth of the cellulolytic strains Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Bacteroides succinogenes when included in a simple sugars medium at concentrations of >5 mM. The extent of cellulose digestion by R. flavefaciens and B. succinogenes but not R. albus was also substantially reduced. Examination of rumen fluid from sheep maintained on dried grass containing 0.51% phenolic acids showed the presence of phloretic acid (0.1 mM) and 3-methoxyphloretic acid (trace) produced by hydrogenation of the 2-propenoic side chain of p-coumaric and ferulic acids, respectively. The parent acids were found in trace amounts only, although they represented the major phenolic acids ingested. Phloretic and 3-methoxyphloretic acids proved to be considerably less toxic than their parent acids. All of the cellulolytic strains (and Streptococcus bovis) showed at least a limited ability to hydrogenate hydroxycinnamic acids, with Ruminococcus spp. proving the most effective. No further modification of hydroxycinnamic acids was produced by the single strains of bacteria examined. However, a considerable shortfall in the recovery of added phenolic acids was noted in media inoculated with rumen fluid. It is suggested that hydrogenation may serve to protect cellulolytic strains from hydroxycinnamic acids.
TI  - Effect of pH on growth rates of rumen amylolytic and lactilytic bacteria.
AB  - The relationship between the pH of the medium and specific growth rates, in well-buffered media at 38.5 degrees C, was determined for three strains of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and for one strain each of Streptococcus bovis, Selenomonas ruminantium subsp. lactilytica. Megasphaera elsdenii, Veillonella alcalescens, and Propionibacterium acnes. The pH optima for growth were between 6.1 and 6.6 for all six species, and the upper pH limits were between 7.3 and 7.8. The lower limit pH values for growth on glucose were 5.4 for B. fibrisolvens, near 5.0 for V. alcalescens, and between 4.4 and 4.8 for the other four species. These values fall within the minimum pH ranges found when these species are grown in poorly buffered medium with nonlimiting glucose concentrations. Acid sensitivity per se could cause the washout of B. fibrisolvens, but not of the other five species, from the rumens of animals on high-starch diets.
TI  - Value of the minimum bactericidal concentration of antibiotics in the management  of a case of recurrent Streptococcus bovis septicaemia.
AB  - After prostatectomy a 60-year-old man developed Streptococcus bovis septicaemia.  The patient did not respond to treatment with a combination of ampicillin and erythromycin and in vitro antagonism between these antibiotics was demonstrated by minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). The value of determining the MBC of antibiotics used in the treatment of septicaemia is emphasised.
TI  - Anaerobic radiometric detection of facultative Gram-positive cocci in blood.
AB  - Radiometric detection of facultative gram-positive cocci, particularly streptococci, has been reported to be suboptimal. A recently marketed anaerobic Bactec bottle (7C) with purportedly improved capability to detect facultative gram-positive cocci in blood was compared with the previously available bottle in a study of simulated bacteremia. The Bactec system detected all beta-hemolytic streptococci and enterococci tested. Detection of alpha-hemolytic streptococci was improved in general. However, detection of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus bovis and Streptococcus pneumoniae remained suboptimal under anaerobic conditions. A metabolic index unit threshold for positivity of 15 is recommended when employing the anaerobic Bactec bottle.

TI  - Effect of carbohydrates on the antibacterial activity of patulin on Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - The antibiotic activity of patulin on Streptococcus bovis varied in the presence  of different sugars in the incubation medium. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of patulin was 4.5 times greater in the medium containing glucose than in the lactose-containing medium (100.5 versus 22 micrograms/mL). The addition of two sugars (glucose plus lactose) to the medium was followed by the utilization of glucose only when patulin was present; lack of growth on lactose was not due to beta-galactosidase inactivation by patulin.
TI  - Direct testing of blood cultures for detection of streptococcal antigens.
AB  - A direct, rapid, and simple method for the detection of streptococcal antigens of Lancefield groups A, B, C, D, and G from blood cultures was developed by using a coagglutination test. Fifty-five clinical specimens and 117 simulated blood cultures containing gram-positive cocci were tested. Out of 6,261 clinical blood cultures screened, 55 cultures from 53 patients were positive, with organisms resembling streptococci, by Gram stain. Of these cultures, 78% (43 of 55) were pure cultures of streptococci, and 22% (12 of 55) were mixed with at least one other organism. Of the 43 pure cultures only, correct reactions were obtained (grouping correctly or giving no cross-reactions, or both) with 86% (37 of 43) of the isolates, 12% (5 of 43) exhibited cross-reactions, and 2% (1 of 43) gave false-negative reactions. All of the cross-reacting isolates were Streptococcus pneumoniae, which reacted with the group C reagent, and the false-negative reaction occurred with a Streptococcus bovis isolate. However, by using a direct modified bile solubility test, the correct identification of the S. pneumoniae isolates was obtained. Therefore, by using the modified bile solubility test in conjunction with the direct grouping method, 98% (42 of 43) of the isolates in pure culture could be identified accurately and rapidly after the detection of a positive Gram stain. Correct grouping reactions were obtained with 83% (10 of 12) of the mixed blood cultures, and false-negative results occurred with 17% (2 of 12) of them. Both cultures contained an enterococcus and a gram-negative rod. Of the 117 simulated blood cultures, there was only one incorrect grouping reaction; this occurred with an S. bovis isolate that cross-reacted with the group C reagent. The direct grouping reaction was positive when blood cultures contained a minimum of 1 x 10(8) to 8 x 10(8) colony-forming units per ml. In general, this procedure provided information on the identification of the organism 24 h earlier than by conventional identification methods.

TI  - [Antibiotic resistance genetic basis of human origin streptococci (author's transl)].
AB  - One hundred strains of group A, B, C, D (S faecalis, S. faecium, S. bovis) F, G,  S. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci were studied. All these strains were clinical isolates from infective endocarditis and fron upper respiratory, skin, genital and urinary tract infections. These stains were resistant to one or several antibiotics : tetracycline, macrolide and related drugs, chloramphenicol, aminoglycosides (high-level resistance to streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin), and penicillin. Conjugative transfer of antibiotic resistance markers (except penicillin) into streptococcal recipients was obtained at a high frequency (10(-1) to 10(-4)) for 12 strains and at a low frequency (10(-5) to 10(-8)) for 29 strains. R plasmids carrying various groups of resistance markers were isolated with different molecular weights. Enzyme restriction analysis showed the existence of different molecular species of streptococcal plasmids. All attempts to detect extrachromosomal DNA in 17 wild-type strains and in the corresponding transconjugants were unsuccessful.
TI  - Apical periodontitis induced by selected bacterial strains in root canals of immunized and nonimmunized monkeys.
AB  - Experimental infections in root canals with Streptococcus faecalis ss. liquefaciens (Strep-MC4). Actinomyces bovis (Act-MC6) and Bacteroides oralis (Bact-MC3) were studied in four immunized and five nonimmunized monkeys. The immunization was performed using antigens of the homologous strains. The antibody level was checked by gel diffusion. In 56 root canals of the immunized animals and 60 root canals of the nonimmunized animals, viable cells of the three bacterial strains were enclosed in equal amounts of various combinations. After 6 months, samples from the root canals were subjected to qualitative and quantitative bacteriologic analyses and the apical area was radiographically and histologically examined. The analyses revealed no significant difference between the two groups of monkeys, although the viable cell recovery was slightly higher in most of the root canals of nonimmunized monkeys. The cell proportion of the strains within the different bacterial combinations was equal in root canals of the two groups of animals. The radiographic and histologic examinations revealed no significant difference between the two groups of animals regarding the number of teeth with periapical lesions. The radiographic examination, however, showed a more distinct limitation of the process in the immunized than in the nonimmunized monkeys. Histologically the lesions were more encapsulated and had a sparser cell infiltration in immunized than in nonimmunized monkeys. In the latter, inflammatory cells had often infiltrated the bone. Mixed infections gave a more severe periapical reaction than single strain infections in both animal groups.

TI  - Meningitis caused by Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis was isolated from the CSF of a 66-year-old man with meningitis. His clinical appearance was unusual in that he lacked typical signs and symptoms of pyogenic meningitis. Streptococcus bovis was also recovered from his blood, which suggested that bacterial endocarditis was the source of his CNS infection. He was cured after four weeks of therapy with intravenous penicillin G potassium. This is the fourth reported case of meningitis caused by S bovis. The previous three patients also had endocarditis caused by S bovis. Because of the reported propensity of S bovis to infect heart valves and the frequent association of S bovis bacteremia with malignant gastrointestinal (GI) tract tumors, recovery of this organism form CSF should prompt a search for bacterial endocarditis and occult GI cancer.
TI  - Infective endocarditis in a community hospital.
AB  - Recent reviews from major university centers of infective endocarditis have stressed an increase in unusual infections owing to virulent pathogens. This article compares the 40 episodes of infective endocarditis at a community hospital complex with the recent literature. It was observed that the majority of infecting microorganisms were penicillin-susceptible streptococci similar to those seen in the early antibiotic era. An older patient population was encountered, but overall mortality was low. Streptococcus bovis was a frequent cause of both natural and prosthetic valve infections. Symptoms lasting longer than two months were associated with vegetations demonstrated by echocardiography and high morbidity. Clinical features in this series that significantly correlated with a poor prognosis were height of fever at admission, the failure of fever to resolve within one week of appropriate therapy, the degree of peripheral leukocytosis, gross hematuria, and CNS signs. Conservative parenteral treatment closely monitored by serum bactericidal levels was employed. No relapses occurred among patients surviving initial therapy.
TI  - Effect of lasalocid, monensin or thiopeptin on lactic acidosis in cattle.
AB  - Lasalocid, monensin or thiopeptin was administered intraruminally each at .33, .65 or 1.3 mg/kg body weight and evaluated for its effectiveness in preventing experimentally induced lactic acidosis in cattle. Four rumen-fistulated cattle were used for each dosage level and the design was a 4 x 4 Latin square with each animal receiving lasalocid, monensin, thiopeptin or no antibiotic. Acidosis was induced by intraruminal administration of glucose (12.5 g/kg body weight). Control cattle exhibited the typical drop in rumen pH and concurrent increases in L(+) and D(-) lactate concentrations commonly observed in cases of lactic acidosis. Alkali reserves were depleted in the control cattle as evidenced by a decrease in blood bicarbonate and a negative shift in base excess. In all three trials, cattle given lasalocid had higher rumen pH and lower lactate concentrations than did control cattle or cattle given monensin or thiopeptin. Cattle given monensin had a significantly higher rumen pH and a lower lactate concentration than the controls only at the .65 and 1.3 mg/kg body weight dosages, whereas thiopeptin was effective only at the 1.3-mg dosage. Concentrations of total VFA in rumen fluid decreased in the controls but remained unchanged in cattle given antibiotics. A significant reduction in the molar proportion of acetate and an increase in the molar proportion of propionate were observed in the rumen fluid of the cattle given antibiotics. Colony counts of Streptococcus bovis and Lactobacillus were significantly reduced in rumen fluid of cattle given 1.3 mg antibiotic/kg body weight. Counts of lactate-utilizing bacteria increased in both control cattle and cattle given antibiotics. Cattle given antibiotics showed no evidence of lacticacidemia, hemoconcentration or change in acid-base balance.
TI  - Purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - An inhibition factor from Streptococcus mutans strain C3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. Bacteriocin C3603 is a basic protein with a pI value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. The activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by pH over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees C for 10 min at pH 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees C for 15 min at pH 4.0. Pronase; papain, phospholipase C, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. Bacteriocin activity was greater against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and f than against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. Bacteriocin C3603 was also effective against selected strains of S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. bovis, S. faecium, S. lactis, Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, Propionibacterium acnes, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Corynebacterium parvum, and Candida albicans. The inhibition of S. mutans strains BHT and PS-14 by bacteriocin C3603 was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. When water or a diet containing bacteriocin C3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with S. mutans PS-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
TI  - The association of remote Streptococcus bovis bacteremia with colonic neoplasia.
AB  - We prospectively studied five patients with a remote history of Streptococcus bovis bacteremia who had not previously been evaluated for colonic pathology. This study was prompted by several reports of concomitant neoplasia in patients with recent S. bovis bacteremia. The patients were studied at a mean of 32 months after bacteremia. Despite the absence of other signs or symptoms suggestive of bowel disease, a negative test for occult blood in stool and a negative fecal culture for S. bovis, two patients were found to have neoplastic polyps of the colon. These findings suggest that the risk of colonic neoplasia in patients with remote S. bovis septicemia is similar to that found in patients with recent bacteremia, but evaluation of a larger group of these patients will be necessary to establish this risk.

TI  - High-level aminoglycoside resistance in group A, B, G, D (Streptococcus bovis), and viridans streptococci.
AB  - Of 20 clinical isolates of group A, B, G, D (Streptococcus bovis), and viridans streptococci, 5 transferred their antibiotic resistance markers into streptococcal recipients at a low frequency (10(-4) to 10(-8)) in the apparent absence of extrachromosomal elements. All strains carried genetic markers for high-level resistance to streptomycin, kanamycin, neomycin, lividomycin A, and ribostamycin, as well as resistance to macrolides and related drugs, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol.
TI  - Identification of group D streptococci by SeroSTAT.
AB  - Clinical isolates of group D streptococci presumptively identified by biochemical methods were grouped by latex agglutination using a commercially prepared reagent specifically sensitized with group D antiserum (SeroSTAT; Scott Laboratories, Inc., Fiskeville, R.I.). Streptococcus species tested included S. faecalis, S. faecium, S. durans, S. avium, S. bovis, and S. equinus. Colonies of the organism to be tested were picked from agar plates, emulsified in a drop of glycine-buffered saline on a slide, and mixed with a drop of the latex reagent. Macroscopic agglutination occurred within 60 s. A total of 115 isolates of group D streptococci were tested; 103 (89.6%) gave positive reactions with SeroSTAT. Twelve strains failed to react with the latex reagent; these 12 strains also gave negative results with group D antiserum when tested by the Lancefield method. Two of 14 group A streptococci also reacted with the SeroSTAT group D reagent; after trypsinization, the cross-reaction was eliminated. Group B streptococci, viridans group streptococci, anaerobic streptococci, and staphylococci all gave negative reactions with the SeroSTAT reagent. The SeroSTAT reagent is a useful diagnostic tool for the prompt identification of enterococcal and non-enterococcal group D streptococci.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis bacteremia following surgical cure of colonic cancer.
AB  - A patient with adenocarcinoma of the colon developed S. bovis endocarditis 21 months after presumed surgical cure of his cancer. The sequence in all previously published cases is that of bacteremia first, followed by a diagnosis of colon cancer. Is there a predetermined genetic or immunologic factor predisposing to S. bovis bacteremia even after the integrity of the mucosal barrier has been restored post-resection?
TI  - Vancomycin therapy for infective endocarditis.
AB  - The use of vancomycin is increasing for the treatment of serious life-threatening staphylococcal and other bacterial infections, including infective endocarditis, in patients who are allergic to the penicillins. The literature through 1978 reveals approximately 55 cases of infective endocarditis treated with vancomycin alone or with combined antibiotic therapy. Many of these 55 patients were treated by different clinicians, were given variable regimens of therapy, received other therapy before vancomycin, had associated valve replacement; various amounts of data were provided for the reported cases. A summary of these reports indicates a cure in 48 (87%) of the 55 patients. Recent in vitro and in vivo animal and patient data indicate that vancomycin alone or as part of combined therapy is bactericidal and curative in patients allergic to penicillin for infective endocarditis caused by staphylococci and streptococci-both enterococcal and nonenterococcal (Streptococcus bovis and viridans group streptococci) infections. In this study, 10 patients with infective endocarditis were treated with vancomycin or combined therapy; seven were cured. Five of the 10 patients with infective endocarditis caused by viridans streptococci were cured with combined vancomycin-streptomycin given in short-term therapy for two weeks.
TI  - The antibacterial action of vancomycin.
AB  - Vancomycin inhibits the second stage of cell wall synthesis in susceptible bacteria. Furthermore, there is evidence that vancomycin also alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits ribonucleic acid synthesis. Stable L-phase variants are susceptible to vancomycin, but induction of bacterial L-phase variants with vancomycin is very difficult. Vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive cocci and bacilli, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (including multiply resistant strains). Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiply resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus bovis, viridans group Streptococcus, enterococcus, Clostridium species, diphtheroids, Listeria monocytogenes, Actinomyces species, and Lactobacillus species. Antimicrobial activity can be enhanced with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against S. aureus, S. bovis, enterococcus, and viridans Streptococcus. The combination of vancomycin and rifampin also has enhanced activity against S. aureus.

TI  - Degradation of protein by mixed cultures of rumen bacteria: identification of Streptococcus bovis as an actively proteolytic rumen bacterium.
AB  - Mixed cultures of rumen bacteria were inoculated into anaerobic buffer solutions  containing mixed carbohydrates, casein and ammonia, and rates of bacterial growth, protein degradation, ammonia formation or utilization and lactate production were determined. Bacterial growth rate was varied by the provision of excess carbohydrate (one large dose at the onset of the incubation) or limited carbohydrate (small doses every hour or every 2 hr). When carbohydrate was limited, growth rate was slow, the extent of protein degradation was small and lactate did not accumulate in the fermentation vessels. Lactate production and protein degradation were also negligible during the initial phases of the high carbohydrate, fast growth rate incubations, but large increases in each were seen after 3 hours. Microscopic examination of the fast growth incubations revealed large numbers of small ovoid cells similar to Streptococcus bovis, while tha slow growth incubations exhibited a variety of morophological types and very few small ovoid cells. Because the lactic acid and morphological data suggested that proliferation of S. bovis might be responsible for rapid proteolysis, effects of gram-positive antibiotics were examined. When compared against a fast growth control, both thiopeptin (5 ppm) and monensin (5ppm) were found to decrease protein degradation, but the inhibition by thiopeptin (50%) was greater than that by monensin (13%). The ratios of protein degraded to bacteria protein synthesized were .659, .362 and .628 for the control, thiopeptin and monensin treatments, respectively. Actively proteolytic strains of S. bovis were isolated from fast growth incubations, and subsequent experiments showed that the ratio of protein degraded to bacterial protein synthesized was approximately 1.50. Collectively, the data indicate that S. bovis is a very proteolytic rumen bacterium.
TI  - Rumen Bacterial Competition in Continuous Culture: Streptococcus bovis Versus Megasphaera elsdenii.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis and Megasphaera elsdenii were grown in continuous culture with maltose as the limiting substrate at dilution rates of 0.36, 0.22, and 0.12 h. After each steady-state turnover, the pH was decreased by adding concentrated HCl to the medium reservoir. Relative counts of the two species at each dilution rate indicated that when the pH was high (6.6 to 6.0), higher dilution rates selected for a higher ratio of S. bovis to M. elsdenii. At intermediate pH (6.0 to 5.4), higher dilution rates once again selected for greater numbers of S. bovis in relation to M. elsdenii, but the increase in S. bovis numbers was much less at the 0.36-h dilution rate. Decreasing the pH below 5.4 caused the ratio of S. bovis to M. elsdenii to increase greatly, and no M. elsdenii cells were seen below pH 5.1. The ratio of the two species could be explained by their relative affinities for maltose if pH was greater than 6.0, but the lower relative numbers of S. bovis in the 0.36-h, intermediate-pH (6.0 to 5.4) incubations could not. Analysis of lactate production by S. bovis in pure culture showed that l-lactate was produced only if the pH was less than 5.2 at dilution rates of 0.22 and 0.12 h and less than 6.0 at a rate of 0.36 h. The lower numbers of S. bovis relative to M. elsdenii in the incubations with a dilution rate of 0.36 h and intermediate pH thus could be explained by utilization of l-lactate by M. elsdenii. The very high numbers of S. bovis at pH less than 5.4 were consistent with the greater tolerance of this organism to low pH.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis meningitis and carcinoma of the colon.
AB  - A 90-year-old woman who presented with Streptococcus bovis meningitis was found at autopsy to have a colonic carcinoma. Although the association between colonic carcinoma and S. bovis endocarditis or bacteremia is well-documented in the literature, S. bovis meningitis is uncommon. A thorough investigation of the gastrointestinal tract should be undertaken in patients with S. bovis infections even in the absence of gastrointestinal signs or symptoms.
TI  - Mannitol agar for microbiologic diagnosis of bovine mastitis.
AB  - A medium containing mannitol (mannitol agar) was developed and evaluated as a tool for the microbiologic diagnosis of bovine mastitis. Mannitol agar supported growth of all important bacterial mastitis pathogens (staphylococci, streptococci, coliforms, and pseudomonads) except Corynebacterium pyogenes. Color change around colonies in the agar permitted the differentiation of pathogenic from nonpathogenic staphylococci. Most Staphylococcus aureus strains and some Staphylococcus epidermidis strains produced yellow zones. These yellow zone-producing strains (mannitol fermenters) of staphylococci were obtained from quarters with significantly elevated (P less than 0.05) somatic cell counts (SCC) in the milk, as compared with uninfected quarters and, therefore, would be considered pathogens. Mannitol-negative strains of S epidermidis (those with red zones) were obtained from quarters with SCC similar to those of uninfected quarters. The streptococci could be divided into 2 groups on the basis of color change around the colonies: Streptococcus agalactiae, Str dysgalactiae, and group G streptococci produced red zones; Str uberis, Str bovis, and enterococci produced yellow zones. Pathogenic streptococci (Str agalactiae, Str dysgalactiae, Str uberis, and group G streptococci) were obtained from quarters with SCC significantly higher (P less than 0.01) than those of uninfected quarters. Streptococcus bovis and enterococci were obtained from quarters with SCC similar to those of uninfected quarters and were considered nonpathogenic. Pathogenic streptococci were found in much higher concentration than nonpathogenic streptococci and could be differentiated on that basis.
TI  - Polyposis coli presenting with Streptococcus bovis endocarditis.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis bacteremia is an important early clue to the presence of serious and clinically unexpected gastrointestinal disease, particularly carcinoma of the colon. S. bovis bacteremia has also been associated with carcinoma of the esophagus and stomach, gastric lymphoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, intestinal diverticulosis and single adenomatous polyps and villous polyps of the colon. We report a patient with S. bovis endocarditis as the initial clinical manifestation of extensive polyposis of the colon and rectum. All patients with S. bovis bacteremia need thorough investigation of their gastrointestinal tract even in the absence of symptoms, signs, or positive laboratory tests suggestive of gastrointestinal pathology.
TI  - Isolation and presumptive identification of adherent epithelial bacteria ("epimural" bacteria) from the ovine rumen wall.
AB  - One hundred sixty-one strains of adherent bacteria were isolated under anaerobic  conditions from four sites on the rumen epithelial surface of sheep fed hay or a hay-grain ration. Before isolation of bacteria, rumen tissue was washed six times in an anaerobic dilution solution, and viable bacteria suspended in the washings were counted. Calculation indicated that unattached bacteria would have been removed from the tissue by this procedure, but a slow and progressive release of attached bacteria also occurred. Nevertheless, a wide range of characteristic morphological types remained associated with the epithelium as demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy. Most of these types were represented among the isolates. Characterization and presumptive identification of the isolates showed that 95.0% belonged to previously described genera of functionally significant rumen bacteria, including Butyrivibrio sp. (31.1%), Bacteroides sp. (22.4%), Selenomonas ruminantium (9.9%), Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens (8.7%), Streptococcus bovis (8.1%), Propionibacterium sp. (4.3%), Treponema sp. (3.1%), and Eubacterium sp., Lachnospira multiparus, and Ruminococcus flavefaciens (2.5% each). Eight isolates (5.0%) were not identified. L. multiparus was recovered only from hay-fed animals; all other genera were obtained from animals fed either ration. All S. bovis strains and two strains each of Bacteroides sp. and Butyrivibrio sp. were aerotolerant; all other strains were strictly anaerobic. Bacteria representing the gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic flora associated with rumen wall tissue (R. J. Wallace, K.-J. Cheng, D. Dinsdale, and E. R. Orskov, Nature (London) 279:424-426, 1979) were therefore not recovered by the techniques used; instead a different fraction of the adherent population was isolated. The term "epimural" is proposed to describe the flora associated with the rumen epithelium.

TI  - Gentamicin-thallous-carbonate medium for isolation of fecal streptococci from foods.
AB  - Gentamicin-thallous-carbonate (GTC) agar was formulated by Donnelly and Hartman (Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 35:576-581, 1978) to select for fecal streptococci in sewage and water samples. The present study was conducted to determine the usefulness of GTC agar for the enumeration of fecal streptococci in foods. Comparisons were made with KF streptococcal (KF), Pfizer selective enterococcus (PSE), and thallous acetate (TA) agars. Samples of ground beef pork sausage, frozen broccoli, frozen fish, and ice cream were examined. Presumptive streptococcal counts obtained on GTC agar were significantly higher than those obtained on KF and PSE agars and were comparable to those obtained on TA agar. GTC was more sensitive than KF or PSE agars primarily because of the recovery of greater numbers of Streptococcus bovis and Streptococcus equinus strains. Percentages of confirmed fecal streptococci obtained on GTC, KF, PSE, and TA agars were 70, 95, 80, and 74, respectively. Differences between these percentages were not statistically significant, but they indicated that selectivity of GTC agar could be improved. Advantages of using GTC agar to isolate fecal streptococci from foods include a short incubation time (16 to 18 h) and large, distinct colonies that facilitate rapid enumeration and subsequent confirmation.
TI  - Effects of lasalocid or monensin on lactate-producing or -using rumen bacteria.
AB  - Lasalocid or monensin inhibited most of the lactate-producing rumen bacteria (Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Eubacterium cellulosolvens, E. ruminantium, Lachnospira multiparus, Lactobacillus ruminis, L. vitulinus, Ruminococcus albus, R. flavefaciens, Streptococcus bovis). Minimum inhibitory concentrations ranged from .38 to 3.0 micrograms/ml. Among the lactate producers, those that produce succinate as a major end product (Bacteroides, Selenomonas, Succinimonas, Succinivibrio) were not inhibited by lasalocid or monensin. Also, none of the major lactate fermenters (Anaerovibrio, Megasphaera, Selenomonas) was inhibited by lasalocid or monensin. Veillonella alcalescens was inhibited by 24 micrograms/ml of lasalocid but was resistant to monensin. Hence, the reported increase in propionate in lasalocid- or monensin-fed cattle may result from selection for succinate producers and lactate fermenters. Lasalocid and monensin appeared to inhibit selectively the production of L(+), but not D(-) lactic acid. The inhibition of major lactate-producing bacteria (Streptococcus and Lactobacillus) suggests that lasalocid or monensin may be used to prevent lactic acidosis in ruminants.
TI  - [Observations on the fecal streptococcal flora in carnivorous domestic animals (author's transl)].
AB  - From 1200 feces-samples streaks of carnivorous domestic animals (1027 from dogs,  173 from cats) 744 streptococci-strains were isolated and differentiated. 87% proved their, self to be streptococcus group D/enterococcus, 13% falled to 11 others species, much-numerous represented streptococci of Viridans-group (Sc. MG, Sc. milleri, Sc. salivarius, Sc. viridans), Sc. group G (beta-hemolytic biotypes) and Sc. lactis (group N). Among the group D-spezies the most showed species at dogs was Sc. bovis (35%), retinued by Sc. faecium and Sc. durans (ever about 18%) and the both Sc.-faecalis-sub-spezies var. liquefaciens and var. faecalis (ever about 8%). At cats, the relation respecting to group D-shares, especially of Sc. bovis, were strong varying. All together an interesting survey on the qualitative composition of the streptococcal flora in dog- and cat-intestine was obtained.
TI  - Short-term therapy for streptococcal infective endocarditis. Combined intramuscular administration of penicillin and streptomycin.
AB  - In a prospective study, 91 patients with penicillin-sensitive infective endocarditis (IE) were treated for two weeks with intramuscular (IM) penicillin G procaine, 1.2 million units every six hours, plus streptomycin sulfate, 500 mg IM every 12 hours. Viridans streptococci were isolated from 70 patients (77%); 21 patients (23%) had Streptococcus bovis infections. Eighteen patients (20%) had had symptoms of IE for three months or longer. Follow-up ranged from two months to 6.6 years. There were no relapses; mild vestibular toxic reactions occurred in two patients (2%). Two patients (2%) died--one of sudden-onset severe heart failure and one of cardiac arrest after aortic valve replacement. Twenty-six patients (19%) required cardiac valve replacement after completion of antimicrobial therapy. This therapy seems as efficacious as four weeks of parenteral antimicrobial therapy and is more cost-effective.
TI  - [Enterococcal studies of uncut raw dried meat products].
AB  - Studies were carried out on a total of 75 samples of raw-dried meat products of a compact type--dried beef, Gabrovska Keiser dried meat, pig salted neck, rolled meat Trapezitsa, V. Turnovo delicacy, and Elena fillet, to establish the amount of Staphylococcus bacteria. It was found that the enterococcus titer of this type of meat products varied from 10(-1) to 10(-4), depending on the product. Most strongly contaminated with enterococci proved the pig salted neck. The higher amounts of enterococci in the studied products as well as their higher resistance to the action of unfavourable factors (ph, NaCl, water content) showed their advantage over the coliform bacteria as sanitary-index organisms in raw-dried meat products of a compact type. Various ratios of all species of enterococci were established in these products. Str. faecius was most often found (32.44 per cent), followed by Str. faecalis (26.22 per cent), Str. faecalis var. liquefaciens (16.00 per cent), and Str. durans (12.00 per cent). Str. faecalis var. zymogenes (8.00 per cent) and Str. bovis (5.33 per cent) were isolated less frequently from some of the products only.
TI  - Studies on streptococci. I. Distribution of fecal streptococci in man.
AB  - To understand the significance to the host of streptococci as part of the intestinal microflora, we first tried to investigate the distribution of human fecal streptococci on the species level. Of the selective media compared, KMN agar was more effective than the other media for the isolation of streptococci from human feces. We made an effort to improve streptococcal classification. Especially we used utilization of 1% pyruvate, 1% arginine, and 1% citrate for differentiation between Streptococcus faecalis and S. faecium. In a tellurite tolerance test, S. faecalis was distinguished more clearly from S. faecium in the medium containing 0.16 or 0.32% tellurite. We devised methods of presumptive identification of fecal streptococci from the results of the characteristics of 1,442 isolates. These methods enabled us to identify many strains rapidly. Different results in the distribution of species of streptococci between children and adults were observed. S. faecalis and S. faecium were isolated constantly from both groups. S. bovis and S. avium were isolated frequently from the feces of children. On the other hand, "viridans" streptococci, e.g. S. salivarius, S. mitis and S. MG-intermedius were present at a high frequency in, and no S. avium could be isolated from, the feces of adults.
TI  - Bacterial food-poisoning versus coliforms-faecal streptococci and gamma radiation survival/dose.
AB  - All the species tested were sensitive to gamma radiation treatment, even at a dose as low as 0.001 Mrad. The spore-former Bacillus cereus (PCJ 213) proved to be more resistant than the rest of the tested species, while the Gram-negative organisms were more susceptible to irradiation treatment. The tolerance among those organisms is depicted by the descending order: Proteus vulgaris, irregular VI, Escherichia coli I, E. coli III, and Salmonella typhi-murium. Yet all the tested faecal streptococci species, with the exception of Streptococcus bovis, may be regarded as holding an intermediate position between the more resistant B. cereus (PCJ 213) and the more sensitive Gram-negative organisms.
TI  - Comparison of selective media for the enumeration and identification of fecal streptococci from natural sources.
AB  - Five media and procedures were compared for their recovery of fecal streptococci  on membrane filters. Growth and numbers of a variety of pure cultures were compared, and recoveries from raw sewage and sewage effluent were determined on the five media. A total of 512 isolates were identified and the specificity of each medium was determined from these results. While KE agar recovered significantly higher numbers of organisms, only 81% of the positive colonies were fecal streptococci. Slanetz and Bartley (SB) medium showed similarly low specificity and the mE procedure gave low recoveries. Best overall results were obtained on mEnterococcus (mEnt) agar with high (91%) specificity for enterococci, and very good recovery efficiency with low background counts. This medium was also the only one demonstrating any appreciable recovery of other fecal streptococci with 93% of the background colonies being confirmed as fecal streptococci which most were Streptococcus bovis, S. equinus, or S. salivarius. Pfizer selective enterococcus (PSE) agar was second in overall performance with a high (94%) rate of specificity but this medium had lower recovery efficiency and high background counts. Performance of PSE agar could be considerably improved, without impairing specificity, by using a total count disregarding esculin hydrolysis.
TI  - Further characteristics of beta2-microglobulin binding to oral streptococci.
AB  - A total of 85 strains of oral bacteria representing Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, S. Mitior, S. salivarious, S. milleri, S. infrequens, S. durans, S. lactis, S. faecalis, S. faecium, S. equinus, Streptococcus species group E, Actinomyces, and one group A Streptococcus were tested for binding of aggregated human beta 2-microglobulin. Positive affinity between bacteria and aggregated human beta 2-microglobulin was detected in 36% of the strains. No apparent correlation with bacterial species, serotype, or group was noted. No positive strains were detected among seven group I:A S. sanguis strains (P < 0.01). Binding constants for one S. mutans strain indicated heterogeneous binding structures on the bacterial surface. The number of binding sites for aggregates of human beta 2-microglobulin involving multipoint attachment varied from 70 to 1,700 per bacterial cell. With whole saliva as buffer, a general increase in affinity was seen. Variations in salt concentrations of the buffers revealed different salt-dependent species-associated uptake patterns. Oral bacteria tended to have an uptake maximum at a salt concentration similar to that seen in saliva. Binding structures for aggregated beta 2-microglobulin on oral streptococci were sensitive to pepsin, heat, and formaldehyde treatment. Bacterial binding structures for aggregated beta 2-microglobulin might represent one of several factors of importance for bacterial attachment in the oral cavity. Experimental conditions reflecting the salivary milieu increased the degree of interaction, emphasizing the importance of physiological test systems for such studies.
TI  - [Group D streptococci in human infections: identification and sensitivity to antibiotics (author's transl)].
AB  - A method for the speciation of group D streptococci is described. A major criterion for identification is the reaction of antigenic extracts against streptococcal group D antisera. In addition, a series of biochemical tests is used: bile-esculine, resistance to 6.5% sodium chloride and potassium tellurite, acid production in mannitol, sorbitol and raffinose, hydrolysis of starch and arginine, and production of dextran. A total of 184 strains was isolated from human material and identified as follows: 104 S. faecalis, 18 S. faecium, 8 S. durans, 2 S. avium, 51 s. bovis and 1 unspeciated. The sensitivity to antibiotics was studied for 141 strains: 34% were sensitive, 23% were singly resistant to tetracycline and 43% were multiply resistant (tetracycline, macrolides and related drugs, high-level resistance to aminoglycosides and to chloramphenicol).
TI  - Immunotherapy of the guinea pig line 10 hepatocarcinoma with a variety of nonviable bacteria.
AB  - A variety of heat-killed bacteria were tested for their capacity to induce regressions of established line 10 hepatocarcinomas in syngeneic guinea pigs. Multiple intralesional injections of heat-killed Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, Listeria monocytogenes, and Propionibacterium acnes resulted in complete regression of the tumor in a majority of guinea pigs. Repeated injections of heat-killed Mycobacterium bovis strain Bacillus Calmette-Guerin caused no regressions. Surviving animals were immune to subsequent challenge with line 10 cells but not L2C cells, another syngeneic tumor.
TI  - The isolation of streptococci from human faeces.
AB  - Three selective media were designed for isolation of streptococci from faeces. Samples of faeces from twelve normal adults were suspended and serially diluted in saline or broth saline, and equal volumes of each dilution were spread and incubated on the media. The number of colonies of each different type which developed was counted and one colony of each type was subcultured and identified. Altogether, streptococci of 13 taxa were found. S. faecium, S. mutans, S. milleri, S. faecalis and S. mitior were each found in over half the samples. Lancefield group B and G streptococci, S. bovis II, an atypical strain of S. bovis I, S. cremoris, S. durans and a dextran-positive strain of S. mitior were each present in 1 or 2 samples. Individual samples contained 2-7 (mean 4.6) streptococcal taxa, and total viable counts of streptococci of 3 X 10(3)-3 X 10(8) (geometric mean 7 X 10(5)) per g. The significance of these findings is discussed.

AB  - In the present study the relationships between skin reactivity, leucocyte migration inhibitory factor (LIF) production and lymphocyte transformation in healthy volunteers and newborns were investigated. LIF synthesis was assessed by the two-step agarose migration method and cellular proliferation by the incorporation of iododeoxyuridine. The following soluble antigens and whole microbes were used: purified protein derivative of tuberculin (PPD), bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), streptokinase-streptodornase (SK-SD), Streptococcus Beta-haemolyticus, group A, Dermatophytin O (DO) and Candida albicans. The results indicated a significant correlation between skin reactivity and in vitro tests with soluble antigens and that, of the in vitro tests used, lymphocyte transformation correlated better with skin test than LIF production. Furthermore, soluble antigens gave better correlations with skin tests than whole microbes. Experiments with cord blood cells demonstrated that they did not respond to antigens but were activated by whole microbes. Thus the whole microbes appear to contain mitogenic components.
TI  - Tumor-immunotherapeutic efficacy of Serratia marcescens polyribosomes.
AB  - The ability of polyribosomes, obtained from several bacterial species, to suppress the development of cutaneous SaD2 fibrosarcomas in DBA/2 mice were evaluated. Suppression of tumor appearance depended upon the tumor load at the time of treatment, dose of polyribosomes, and species source of polyribosomes, with Serratia marcescens being superior to Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycobacterium bovis (Pasteur), Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Propionibacterium acnes (formerly Corynebacterium parvum). A single injection of 5 or 50 microgram of Serratia polyribosomes at the tumor site 72 hr after the intradermal administration of 1.5 X 10(3) SaD2 cells resulted in 66 to 95% survival. All untreated animals expired within 50 days. Tumor suppression occurred at both flank and footpad sites. Presensitization with polyribosomes and incorporation of polyribosomes into adjuvant were not required for the tumor-suppressive effect. Treatment of Serratia polyribosomes with RNase or pronase reduced the number of survivors. Endotoxin was not detectable with the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay.
TI  - Effect of pH on the efficiency of growth by pure cultures of rumen bacteria in continuous culture.
AB  - A total of 10 strains of rumen bacteria, Selenomonas ruminantium HD4, Megasphaera elsdenii B159, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens A38, Streptococcus bovis JB1, Lactobacillus vitulinus GA1, Bacteroides ruminicola B14, B. ruminicola GA33, Ruminococcus albus 7, Ruminococcus flavefaciens C94, and Bacteroides succinogenes S85, were grown in energy-limiteH of the medium reservoir was lowered approximately 0.3 pH units, and the energy source concentration remaining in the culture vessel, optical density, cell mass, and pH were determined. A low pH appeared to have a detrimental effect on cell yields. Large variations were seen among strains in both the magnitude of yield depressions at lower pH values and in the pH at which the culture washed out. Lactate analysis indicated ta are discussed in relation to the effect of pH on the efficiency of protein synthesis in the rumen and rumen microbial ecology.
TI  - Streptococcus equinus septicemia: report of two cases and review of the literature.
AB  - Two cases of septicemia with Streptococcus equinus, a group D streptococcus, are  reported, and the literature pertaining to infections with this organism is reviewed. Both of our patients presented with obvious signs of infection, had S equinus isolated from multiple blood cultures, and had a good clinical response to penicillin therapy, alone or in combination with streptomycin. In vitro testing of the isolates confirmed susceptibility to penicillin. S equinus should now be recognized as a human pathogen as are the other group D streptococci, S bovis and the enterococci.
TI  - Control of wheat-induced lactic acidosis in sheep by thiopeptin and related antibiotics.
AB  - Thiopeptin, thiopeptin-like antibiotics and penicillin were shown previously to be highly active in vitro against Streptococcus bovis, the microorganism believed to be responsible for the initiation of ruminal lactic acidosis. The purpose of this work was to determine the efficacy of these antibiotics in preventing lactic acidosis in lambs challenged by intraruminal administration of ground wheat. Lambs, which were fasted and then given ground wheat at 40 g/kg body weight, showed dramatic increases in rumen and plasma lactate over the 30-hr experimental period. Rumen lactate increased from .2 to peak levels of approximately 150 mumoles/ml by 8 to 10 hr after wheat administration. Plasma lactate increased after rumen lactate was elevated and lambs succumbed when plasma levels exceeded 15 mumoles/ml. Ruminal volatile fatty acids were greatly reduced as rumen lactate increased. Over half of the lambs given ground wheat died within 30 hours. Thiopeptin given as a single dose completely prevented lactic acidosis by reducing rumen lactate 80 to 90%. In addition, thiopeptin permitted "normal" rumen fermentation to continue as indicated by a significant increase in volatile fatty acids. The minimum effective dose of thiopeptin to control acute lactic acidosis was .18 mg/kg body weight. Other members of the thiopeptin class, including sulfomycin, sporangiomycin, siomycin and taitomycin, prevented lactic acidosis in a manner similar to thiopeptin. Penicillin, however, inhibited ruminal volatile fatty acid production as well as lactate synthesis. In addition, the effective period for penicillin in the rumen was only 8 to 16 hr, after which lactate fermentation was reestablished. Thus, thiopeptin and thiopeptin-like antibiotics, but not penicillin, appear to provide prophylactic treatment against lactic acidosis in sheep.

TI  - Comparison of slide coagglutination test and countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis for detection of group B streptococcal antigen in cerebrospinal fluid from infants with meningitis.
AB  - The usefulness of Phadebact streptococcus reagents for the detection of group B streptococcal antigen in cerebrospinal fluid was evaluated in 54 infants with meningitis and in 22 normal infants. Antigens was detected by slide coagglutination in 19 (82.6%) and by countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis in 20 (87.0%) of 23 cerebrospinal fluid specimens from infants with group B streptococcal meningitis at admission. After initiation of antimicrobial therapy, antigen could be detected in 11 of 19 (by slide coagglutination) and 7 of 18 (by countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis) cerebrospinal fluids. False-positive reactions were noted by slide coagglutination in one infant with S. bovis meningitis and one with group B streptococcal bacteremia without meningitis; none occurred with countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis. The commercial availiability, simplicity, sensitivity (82.6%), and specificity (96.4%) of the Phadebact slide coaggluatination test for detecting group B streptococcal antigen in cerebrospinal fluid suggest that it may be useful for the early and rapid diagnosis of group B streptococcal meningitis.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis endocarditis and colorectal disease.
AB  
TI  - Infective endocarditis, 1970-1979. A study of culture-positive cases in St. Thomas' Hospital.
AB  - Ninety-three episodes of culture-positive endocarditis occurred in 88 patients in the years 1970 to 1979. Streptococci caused two-thirds of the cases, with Streptococcus mitior and Streptococcus sanguis most common. Among the Group D streptococci, Streptococcus bovis was much more common than Streptococcus faecalis. Staphylococci accounted for a quarter of the episodes. Streptococcal endocarditis was commonest in the elderly, whereas staphylococcal endocarditis occurred at all ages. Degenerative heart disease was the underlying cardiac factor in nearly half the streptococcal cases, but staphylococci most often affected normal heart valves. When prosthetic valves were infected endocarditis of early onset was staphylococcal but that of late onset was streptococcal. Narcotic abuse was a common cause of staphylococcal endocarditis, second only to surgical wound infection following valve replacement. Streptococci affected the mitral and aortic valves equally but the staphylococci more usually involved mitral or tricuspid valves. The overall mortality was 36 per cent but was much higher for staphylococcal than streptococcal endocarditis.
TI  - [Staphylococcus aureus infection in chickens in industrialized poultry units. 3.  Experimental infection of chickens and comparison of pathogenicity of Staphylococcus aureus of different origin].
AB  - Day-old chicks were subcutaneously infected with Staphylococcus aureus strains of site variety gallinae and crystalviolet Type A. The lysis patterns involved were with phages 84 as well as with phages 53, 77, and 84 of the international base scheme for human staphylococci. In fowl with synovitis and arthritis, osteomyelitis, dermatitis, and septicaemia, 52 of 57 tested strains (91.2 per cent) produced on the site of injection pathognomic oedematous-haemorrhagic and necrotising changes of the skin and hypodermis (haemorrhagic dermatitis) in a way which is characteristic also of natural diseases. However, no specific skin changes could be produced by subcutaneous infection of nine strains of site variety hominis or undefinable category with differentiated biochemical properties and lysis patterns. They had been isolated from cases of compound infection, salpingitis and wound infections as well as from one case of arthritis. Fifty-seven strains, obtained from mammals, were tested subcutaneously, on day-old chicks, among them 21 strains of site varieties of bovis, canis, ovis, and hominis. However, only four of those strains, isolated from miscarried pig foetuses and cattle with mastitis, caused, oedematisation and exudation (7.02 per cent), but no haemorrhagia and only minor lysis and necrosis of skin. The minimum dose required to induce haemolytic dermatitis was 11 x 10(3) pathogens, and the lowest lethal dose of six tested strains was between 11 x 10(5) and 26 x 10(7) pathogens. The lowest dose of mammalian strains with lethality to day-old chicks was [10 bis]10(4) times as high as the lowest dose of fowl strains. Subcutaneous infection of day-old chicks has worked well as a high-speed test by which to differentiate between fowl-pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus strains, on the one hand, and mammalian strains, on the other. The need for delimitation of such strains has been confirmed by the above experimental infections. Against the background of the above results, guidelines are proposed for the control of Staphylococcus aureus infection of fowl.
TI  - Mutagenic activation of an antischistosomal drug by enteric Streptococcus sps in  vitro and in vivo.
AB  - Previous studies have shown that a new antischistosomal drug, 4-isothiocyano-4'-nitro diphenylamine (CGP 4540, amoscanate), is not mutagenic in vitro, but the urines of animals treated with this drug have mutagenic activity. Mutagenicity can be eliminated by coadministration of some antibacterial agents and is not demonstrable in germ-free animals. The present study describes attempts to isolate and identify intestinal microorganisms responsible for the mutagenic activation of amoscanate. Streptococcus equinus, isolated from the intestinal tract of mice, as well as some other species of Streptococcus, were found to produce mutagenic activation of amoscanate when introduced into animals pretreated with antibacterial agents. Similarly, incubation of these strains with amoscanate in vitro resulted in the formation of a mutagenic product.
TI  - Evaluation of commercial latex agglutination reagents for grouping streptococci.
AB  - A total of 155 strains of beta-hemolytic streptococci were serologically grouped  by conventional techniques (Lancefield extraction and capillary precipitin testing) and by latex agglutination (LA). Agreement between conventional and LA techniques was 97% when the instructions of the manufacturer for the LA technique were followed. Agreement of 99% was obtained when modified autoclave extracts were used as antigens in the LA procedure. A total of 82 strains of non-beta-hemolytic streptococci were also tested by conventional, prescribed LA, and modified autoclave procedures. The agreement between conventional techniques and both LA procedures was 76%. However, when serological cross-reactions in the conventional grouping procedures were considered as errors, the accuracy of identification of both LA procedures was 88% among the non-beta-hemolytic strains. Of 13 strains of Streptococcus bovis, 10 did not react with the LA group D reagent but were serogroup D by conventional techniques. More S. bovis strains were grouped by the LA technique when extracts of 20 ml of broth cultures were used as antigens; however, cross-reactions were observed with non-group D strains when this technique was applied to them.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis meningitis in a neonate.
AB  - Neonatal infections have been caused by Streptococcus bovis, a nonenterococcal group D Streptococcus. A recent case of neonatal meningitis caused by this organism prompted a literature review regarding appropriate antibiotic therapy. Although most reports suggested penicillin therapy alone for S bovis meningitis, isolates of this organism that were as resistant to the lethal effect of penicillin as the enterococcus have been recovered. Therefor, it was recommended that until the results of minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration tests are known both an aminoglycoside and a penicillin be used simultaneously. Proved susceptibility to the penicillin would justify discontinuation of the aminoglycoside therapy. Physicians caring for neonates with S bovis should be aware that some strains may be resistant to the lethal effect of penicillin.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of LY 127935 (6059-S), seven cephalosporins, three  aminoglycosides, carbenicillin, and ticarcillin.
AB  - LY 127935 (6059-S), a new semi-synthetic beta-lactam antibiotic was tested simultaneously with 6 cephalosporins, 3 aminoglycosides, carbenicillin and ticarcillin against 398 clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci. Many of the organisms were selected for study because of known resistance to one or more of the clinically available antibiotics tested. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Serratia and Providencia were susceptible to LY 127935. Some resistant strains of Enterobacter, Proteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter were also resistant to LY 127935, but many of the strains resistant to other antibiotics were susceptible to LY 127935. The activity of LY 127935 against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans and Streptococcus bovis was similar to that of cephalexin and cephradine. LY 127935 was not active against methicillin-resistant S. aureus nor enterococcus.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis septicemia and carcinoma of the colon.
AB  - We prospectively studied patients with Streptococcus bovis septicemia for the presence of gastrointestinal lesions. This study was prompted by our reported findings of the association of fecal carriage of S. bovis with carcinoma of the colon. We studied 29 patients with 30 episodes of S. bovis septicemia. Fifteen completed gastrointestinal evaluations that included colonscopy, surgery, or autopsy. Eight of these had carcinoma of the colon, three had adenomatous polyps of the colon without carcinoma, and two had carcinoma of the esophagus. The 14 patients who did not have complete evaluations included one each with carcinoma of the stomach, gastric lymphoma, and adenomatous polyp of the colon and three with colonic masses not further delineated. Nineteen patients had no gastrointestinal signs or symptoms or stools positive for occult blood at admission. The results of our study suggest that all patients with S. bovis septicemia need aggressive evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract, especially the colon.
TI  - The distribution of isoprenoid quinones in streptococci of serological groups D and N.
AB  - The isoprenoid quinone contents of streptococci of serological groups D and N were investigated. Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens and S. faecalis subsp. zymogenes strains contained demethylmenaquinones with nine isoprene units as their major isoprenologues. Menaquinones with eight isoprene units predominated in S. faecium subsp. casseliflavus and S. faecium subsp. mobilis whereas menaquinones with nine isoprene units constituted the major components in strains of S. cremoris, S. cremoris subsp. alactosus, S. lactis and S. lactis subsp. diacetylactis. Strains of S. avium, S. bovis, S. durans, S. equinus, S. faecium, S. raffinolactis and S. suis contained neither menaquinones nor ubiquinones. The isoprenoid quinone data correlate well with other kinds of data on these organisms and are of value in the classification of these bacteria.
TI  - Serologic studies of Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus morbillorum by crossed immunoelectrophoresis.
AB  - A reference antigen-antibody system for Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus  constellatus, and Streptococcus morbillorum was established with crossed immunoelectrophoresis. A comparison of S. intermedius, S. constellatus, and S. morbillorum with crossed immunoelectrophoresis and crossed immunoelectrophoresis with intermediate gel indicated that S. intermedius and S. constellatus are closely related antigenically with as many as six common cytoplasmic antigens. S. morbillorum was antigenically more distinct; antiserum of one strain of S. morbillorum was monospecific, indicating that specific serogroups of S. morbillorum exist. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis and tandem crossed immunoelectrophoresis revealed that S. intermedius, S. constellatus, and S. morbillorum also share some common antigens with Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mitis, but S. intermedius, S. constellatus, and S. morbillorum are antigenically distinct from Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus bovis.

TI  - Antibacterial activity of heneicomycin.
AB  - Heneicomycin is structurally similar to efrotomycin, mocimycin (kirromycin) and X-5108 (goldinomycin). Comparisons were limited because of the small supplies available. All antibiotics show the same in vitro antibacterial spectrum although some test cultures were less sensitive to efrotomycin. Heneicomycin compared favorably with efrotomycin when given subcutaneously or per os against infections with Moraxella bovis and Streptococcus pyogenes. The raid elimination of heneicomycin observed following oral administration may account for its poor activity against a Bordetella bronchiseptica infection where efrotomycin is effective. It appears more like X-5108 than efrotomycin biologically. The disaccharide on efrotomycin may account for the difference observed.
TI  - Bacteriological quality of runoff water from pastureland.
AB  - Runoff from a cow-calf pasture in eastern Nebraska was monitored for total coliforms (TC), fecal coliforms (FC), and fecal streptococci (FS) during 1976, 1977, and 1978. Bacteriological counts in runoff from both grazed and ungrazed areas generally exceeded recommended water quality standards. The FC group was the best indicator group of the impact of grazing. Rainfall runoff from the grazed area contained 5 to 10 times more FC than runoff from the fenced, ungrazed area. There was little difference in TC counts between the two areas, but FS counts were higher in runoff from the ungrazed area and reflected the contributions from wildlife. Recommended bacteriological water quality standards, developed for point source inputs, may be inappropriate for characterizing nonpoint source pollution from pasture runoff. The FC/FS ratio in pasture runoff was useful in identifying the relative contributions of cattle and wildlife. Ratios below 0.05 were indicative of wildlife sources and ratios above 0.1 were characteristic of grazing cattle. Occasions when the FC/FS ratio of diluted cattle waste exceeded one resulted from differential aftergrowth and die-off between FC and FS. The FC/FS ratio and percentage of Streptococcus bovis in pasture runoff are useful indicators for evaluating the effectiveness of livestock management practices for minimizing bacterial contamination of surface water. The importance of choice of medium for the enumeration of FS in runoff derived from cattle wastes is discussed.
TI  - Effects of combinations of substrates on maximum growth rates of several rumen bacteria.
AB  - Five rumen bacteria, Selenomonas ruminantium, Bacteroides ruminicola, Megasphaera elsdenii, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and Streptococcus bovis were grown in media containing nonlimiting concentrations of glucose, sucrose, maltose, cellobiose, xylose and/or lactate. Each bacterium was grown with every substrate that it could ferment in every possible two-way combination. Only once did a combination of substrates result in a higher maximum growth rate than that observed with either substrate alone. Such stimulations of growth rate would be expected if specific factors unique to individual substrates (transport proteins and/or enzymes) were limiting. Since such synergisms were rare, it was concluded that more general factors limit maximum growth rates in these five bacteria.
TI  - Comparison of maintenance energy expenditures and growth yields among several rumen bacteria grown on continuous culture.
AB  - Maintenance energy expenditures were mesured for five rumen bacteria, Selenomonas ruminantium, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Bacteroides ruminicola, Megasphaera elsdenii, and Streptococcus bovis, by using a complex medium with glucose as the carbon source. Large differences (as high as 8.5-fold) in maintenance energy expenditures were seen among these bacteria. The suggestion is made that maintenance requirements could be a significant determinant of bacterial competition in the rumen. Theoretical maximum growth yields, calculated from double reciprocal plots of yield versus dilution rate, were compared to theoretical Y(ATP) values in order to estimate minimum molar adenosine 5'-triphosphate yields from glucose for each bacterium. Results showed that relative yield among the bacteria was growth rate dependent. At high dilution rates, both S. ruminantium and S. bovis produced lactate as their principal fermentation product. At lower dilution rates very little lactate was formed and growth yields increased. Acetate and ethanol were the predominant fermentation products of S. bovis at low dilution rates. Other workers have shown that S. ruminantium produces acetate and propionate at low growth rates.
TI  - Comparison of substrate affinities among several rumen bacteria: a possible determinant of rumen bacterial competition.
AB  - Five rumen bacteria, Selenomonas ruminantium, Bacteroides ruminicola, Megasphaera elsdenii, Streptococcus bovis, and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens were grown in continuous culture. Estimates of substrate affinities were derived from Lineweaver-Burk plots of dilution rate versus substrate concentration. Each bacterium was grown on at least four of the six substrates: glucose, maltose, sucrose, cellobiose, xylose, and lactate. Wide variations in substrate affinities were seen among the substrates utilized by a species and among species for the same substrate. These wide differences indicate that substrate affinity may be a significant determinant of bacterial competition in the rumen where soluble substrate concentrations are often low. Growth of these bacteria in continuous culture did not always follow typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Inflated theoretical maximum growth rates and non-linear Lineweaver-Burk plots were sometimes seen. Maintenance energy expenditures and limitation of growth rate by factors other than substrate concentration (i.e., protein synthesis) are discussed as possible determinants of these deviations.

TI  - Detection of group D and viridans streptococci in blood by radiometric methods.
AB  - A prospective study was conducted to evaluate the radiometric detection of group  D and viridans streptococci in blood, using three media preparations, Bactec 6A and 6B isotonic media and 8B hypertonic medium. All enterococci tested were detected by the 6A and 6B media. However, the 6A medium failed to detect 76% of the Streptococcus bovis isolates and 57% of the viridans streptococci, whereas all S. bovis isolates and 95% of the viridans streptococci were detected with the 6B formulation. No improvement in detection was noted in comparing the 6B and the 8B hypertonic media. The importance of adequate detection of this group of organisms, especially in patients with endocarditis, is discussed.
TI  - Untyped forms of faecal streptococci in Egyptian sewage and Nile water.
AB  - When the thallous-azide agar medium was used a higher incidence of pure faecal streptococci recovery was recorded especially from slightly polluted vehicles such as river water than on the standard M-enterococcus agar medium. In addition, a thallous-azide combination at pH 6.5 was used successfully for the primary isolation of Str. faecalis and its two variants. Results of biochemical tests of 274 faecal streptococci isolates showed that 20% belonged to Str. faecalis and its two variants as well as Str. durans, Str. faecium and Str. equinus. Thirty-eight percent of the isolated strains were classified as atypical I, II, III, and V previously designated by COOPER and RAMADAN (1955) as well as the unclassified group of RAMADAN et al. (1972). While the remaining 42% were found to belong to seven different categories (SALEH 1976 and 1977). The correlation between four differential tests used for defining the source of faecal streptococci isolates was discussed.

TI  - Carriage of group D streptococci in the human bowel.
AB  - Sixty faecal samples, 39 from adults and 21 from neonates, were investigated by means of a simple scheme to isolate and identify any group D streptococci present. A number of differences were found between the two groups. Group D streptococci were absent from 43% of the neonates compared with only 13% of the adults; Streptococcus bovis was commoner in the neonates (23.8%) than in the adults (5%), and Streptococcus faecium was not isolated from any of the infant samples although it was common in the adult samples (25%). The viable counts of Strep. faecium were found to be, on average, 100-fold lower than those of Streptococcus faecalis. The methods and results are discussed with reference to the clinical significance of group D streptococci, especially in bacterial endocarditis and carcinoma of the colon.
TI  - Incidence and relationship of group D streptococci with other indicator organisms in meats.
AB  - Raw and processed meats were analyzed for presumptive group D streptococci using  KF streptococcus agar. Counts were compared with coliform, presumptive Escherichia coli, and Enterobacteriaceae counts but no meaningful relationships were observed. Results indicated that group D streptococci and E. coli type I were principally contaminants from the packing plant, rather than at retail level. The predominating group D streptococcus in both beef and pork cuts was Streptococcus faecalis, while in processed meat (bologna), the predominating group D streptococci were Streptococcus faecium var. durans and Streptococcus faecium. Streptococcus bovis was not detected among the isolates from any meat samples. Marked differences were noted in numbers of group D streptococci in processed meat from different manufacturers. The results did not support the use of group D streptococci as alternative indicator organisms for meats. However, the association of group D streptococci with packing plant contamination may prove to be of value.
TI  - Effect of serum on gram-positive cocci grown in the presence of penicillin.
AB  - Strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus bovis, and a strain of Streptococcus that produces filaments were grown on agar containing penicillin at concentrations of one-half to 1/10th the minimal inhibitory concentration. These penicillin-exposed organisms as well as untreated control organisms were incubated with human serum of plasma. Both serum and plasma produced a remarkable bactericidal effect on the filament-forming Streptococcus grown in the presence of penicillin, whereas the untreated control was only slightly affected. This response resembled that of gram-negative bacilli rather than that of gram-positive cocci. The growth of staphylococci exposed to penicillin was slightly inhibited in the presence of serum, whereas the growth of untreated staphylococci was stimulated. The streptococci, regardless of whether they were treated with penicillin or whether they were untreated, showed no change in growth pattern in the presence of serum.

TI  - Adherence of glucan-positive and glucan-negative streptococcal strains to normal  and damaged heart valves.
AB  - The adherence of 18 strains of streptococci to sections of normal canine and human aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valves and to canine interatrial septum was compared in an in vitro system. Quantitative measurements of adherence ratios were performed by two independent methods. Adherence ratios for Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, S. bovis, and Group D streptococci were higher (0.0058-0.0101) than for the other streptococcal strains studied (0.0025-0.0041). With the exception of Group D streptococci, adherence ratios for each bacterial strain were similar with the aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valve sections. Adherence ratios with normal human and canine valve leaflets were similar, but adherence ratios with interatrial septum were lower than with normal valve sections. Adherence ratios for glucan-positive and glucan-negative strains of streptococci with normal and with damaged aortic valve leaflets were also compared. The adherence ratios of the glucan-positive streptococci (S. mutans, S. sanguis, and S. bovis) and one glucan-negative enterococcal strain (KG-3) were approximately five times higher with damaged aortic valves (0.039-0.051) than with normal aortic valves (0.009-0.010). For glucan-positive strains, adherence ratios with normal aortic leaflets were similar when bacteria were grown in media which contains or lacks sucrose. In striking contrast, growth of the glucan-positive strains in medium which lacks sucrose, with resultant deficiency of glucan production, decreased the adherence ratios with damaged aortic valve leaflets to those found with normal aortic leaflets. Treatment of glucan-positive strains with dextranase resulted in a decrease in their adherence ratios to levels seen with bacteria grown in medium lacking sucrose, but the higher adherence ratios could be restored in the presence of exogenous dextran.It is concluded that glucan production is one quantitatively important factor that contributes to the greater adherence of glucan-positive streptococci to damaged rather than to normal aortic heart valve leaflets. However, glucan production is not the only factor that determines preferential adherence of streptococci to damaged heart valves, because glucan-negative strains may also show some degree of increased adherence to damaged valves. Thus, bacterial glucan production is one of the factors that could contribute to the pathogenesis of bacterial endocarditis.
TI  - Immunological method to differentiate between antigens of tubercle bacilli, other mycobacterial species, and non-acid-fast bacteria.
AB  - Sera from rabbits immunized with sonicates of Mycobacterium bovis BCG were passed through an immunoadsorbent made of a soluble BCG extract to make partially purified antibodies to BCG. These antibodies were in turn used to prepare an immunoadsorbent through which the BCG extract was passed. The partially purified antigenic material was radiolabeled and subjected to electrophoresis in acrylamide gels. One of the radiolabeled fractions isolated (BCG-C) was found to bind to antibodies to BCG and H37Rv, but not to antibodies in sera from rabbits immunized with other mycobacterial species or Nocardia asteroides. The reaction between BCG-C and the partially purified antibodies to BCG was inhibited by small amounts of different BCG antigens. Cultures obtained from 25 patients with tuberculous diseases, other bacterial cultures, and various bacterial extracts were tested for their capacity to inhibit this reaction. Each of 13 mycobacteria identified as M. tuberculosis inhibited this reaction. Equivalent numbers of 12 strains of mycobacteria other than M. tuberculosis and high concentrations of other bacterial extracts did not inhibit, indicating that determinants of BCG present in M. tuberculosis were not detected in the other mycobacteria or in non-acid-fast bacteria. The use of sequential purification procedures could be of potential clinical value in quickly differentiating between M. tuberculosis and a variety of other mycobacteria.
TI  - [The association of a digestive carcinoma and subacute endocarditis. 4 cases (author's transl)].
AB  - Attention has recently been drawn to the association of digestive carcinoma and streptococcus bovis endocarditis. The authors studied 130 records of patients with endocarditis and an association with a digestive tumour (3 neoplasms, one villous tumour) was found in four. Streptococcus bovis was demonstrated in one case, streptococcus faecalis in two and streptococcus durans in one. The association of carcinoma and subacute endocarditis would thus seem to not solely relate to digestive commensual organisms. The question of common factors favourising carcinoma and endocarditis is raised.
TI  - Treatment of bacterial endocarditis with vancomycin.
AB  - Five patients with bacterial endocarditis who were allergic to penicillin were treated successfully with vancomycin. The causative microorganisms were Streptococcus bovis, S faecalis, S agalactiae, S intermedius, and Staphylococcus aureus. Except for the strain of S faecalis, vancomycin was bactericidal against these organisms at easily achievable serum concentrations. To insure a bactericidal serum titer of 1:8 or greater, streptomycin was added in the therapy of the case caused by S faecalis. There was no toxicity from vancomycin therapy in our patients except for mild phlebitis at the infusion site. Vancomycin appears to be an effective alternative to penicillin in individuals with endocarditis due to susceptible organisms. Vancomycin in combination with an aminoglycoside may be appropriate therapy for enterococcal endocarditis.
TI  - Bacteria induce lymphokine synthesis polyclonally in human B lymphocytes.
AB  - We have studied the ability of various bacteria to stimulate human lymphocytes to produce leukocyte migration inhibitory factor (LIF). Mononuclear cells from adult and cord blood as well as purified T and B lymphocytes were stimulated with killed bacteria. The culture supernatants were tested for the presence of LIF by the agarose migration method. All nine bacterial strains tested activated unseparated mononuclear cells and B lymphocytes but not T cells to produce LIF. LIF was also present in cord blood cell cultures suggesting that the stimulation of lymphocytes was polyclonal rather than antigenic. Therefore, we propose that one of the physiologic functions of B lymphocyte lymphokines might be to form part of the nonspecific defense mechanisms against microbial invasion.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis bacteremia and underlying gastrointestinal disease.
AB  - Twenty-six adults with Streptococcus bovis endocarditis and ten with bacteremia alone were studied to determine possible portals of entry. Of 36 patients (17 with endocarditis, eight with bacteremia alone), 25 had gastrointestinal lesions or manipulation. In 22, the gastrointestinal tract appeared to be the source of S bovis bacteremia. Four patients had either carcinoma of the colon (two) or potentially malignant villous adenomas (two) when first seen because of S bovis bacteremia. None of these, nor two other patients with benign colonic polyps, had bowel-related symptoms or signs prior to admission. Since S bovis is a normal intestinal tract inhabitant, bacteremia may frequently be associated with bowel lesions. Streptococcus bovis bacteremia may provide an early clue to the presence of serious and clinically unexpected gastrointestinal disease. Gastrointestinal tract evaluation should be part of S bovis bacteremia patient management, with or without endocarditis.
TI  - Use of pyruvate fermentation compared with tetrazolium reduction in the differentiation of group D streptococci.
AB  - The reduction of 2, 3, 5 triphenyltetrazolium chloride in the original medium of  Barnes (Journal of General Microbiology, 14, 57, 1956), and in a modified medium, was compared with the ability to ferment pyruvate as a means of separating Streptococcus faecalis from all other group D streptococci. The tetrazolium reduction test gave an occasional negative reaction with Str. faecalis strains. In addition, a number of strains gave a weakly positive reaction in the test, as did some strains of Str. faecium and Str. bovis. With some batches of tetrazolium, these weak reactions with Str. faecalis were so frequent that interpretation of the results was difficult. On the other hand, all Str. faecalis strains, and no other group D streptococci, gave a positive pyruvate-fermentation reaction in 48 hours.
TI  - Infective endocarditis caused by Streptococcus bovis resistant to the lethal effect of penicillin G.
AB  - Penicillin G alone is generally recommended for the treatment of infective endocarditis caused by Streptococcus bovis because clinical isolates of S bovis are represented as being uniformly and markedly susceptible to penicillin G. However, two strains of S bovis recovered from two patients with bacterial endocarditis were resistant to the lethal effect of penicillin G. Combination therapy, cefazolin sodium and gentamicin sulfate in patient 1 and penicillin G and gentamicin in patient 2, was necessary; synergy, as manifested by lethal activity against the infecting strains, was demonstrated in the laboratory. We stress the need to determine the minimal lethal concentration of penicillin G for clinical isolates of S bovis. Until such information is available, particularly in life-threatening infections, combination drug therapy, consisting of an aminocyclitol added to a beta-lactam antimicrobic, should be used.
TI  - Production of branched-chain volatile fatty acids by certain anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Net production of isobutyric acid, isovaleric acid, and 2-methylbutyric acid by cultures of Bacteroides ruminicola and Megasphaera elsdenii on media that contained Trypticase or casein hydrolysate continued (up to 5 days) after growth had ceased. Only trace quantities of these acids were produced in a medium that contained a mixture of amino acids that did not include the branched-chain amino acids. M. elsdenii produced increased quantities of the branched-chain fatty acids in a medium that contained Trypticase when glucose was reduced or eliminated from the culture medium. However, B. ruminicola produced increased quantities of branched-chain fatty acids and of phenylacetic acid from Trypticase when glucose was supplied at 3 mg/ml rather than at 1 mg/ml. Single strains of Streptococcus bovis, Selenomonas ruminantium, Bacteroides amylophilus, and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens did not produce branched-chain fatty acids.

TI  - Bacteria associated with the gastric epithelium of neonatal pigs.
AB  - Light and electron microscopy showed lactobacilli and, to a lesser degree, streptococci to be closely associated with the squamous area of the pig stomach known as the pars esophagea. Several different types of extracellular layers were seen on bacteria attached to the epithelial surface. The total number of bacteria per square centimeter did not change with age up to 10 days, and there was no effect of weaning at 2 days. Lactobacillus fermentum, L. salivarius, and Streptococcus salivarius were isolated more frequently from sucking pigs than from those that were early weaned, whereas the reverse was true of L. acidophilus and S. bovis. All isolates recovered from washed macerated pars esophagea adhered to pig esophageal epithelial cells when tested in vitro.
TI  - Effects of heavy metals and other trace elements on the fermentative activity of  the rumen microflora and growth of functionally important rumen bacteria.
AB  - The inhibitory effects of high concentrations of essential and non-essential trace elements were tested on the rumen microflora using the rate of fermentation in vitro as the assay. The elements (and the concentration causing 50% inhibition) in decreasing order of toxicity were Hg2+ (20 microgram/ml), Cu2+ (21 microgram/ml), Cr6+ (70 microgram/ml), Se4+ (73 microgram/ml), Ni2+ (160 microgram/ml), Cd2+ (175 microgram/ml), As3+ (304 microgram/ml) and As5+ (1610 microgram/ml). The elements tested that were either weak or noninhibitory at concentrations greater than 400 microgram/ml included Zn2+, Cr2+, Fe2+, Mn2+, Pb2+, and Co2+. Methylmercury was as inhibitory as mercuric chloride to the fermentation. When the inhibitory effect of Cd2+ was tested on separated bacterial and protozoal fractions, it was more inhibitory to the bacteria. The inhibitory effects of trace elements were also determined for a number of axenic cultures of rumen bacteria. The bacteria which most frequently exhibited the greatest sensitivity were Bacteroides succinogenses, Ruminococcus albus, Bacteroides amylophilus, and Eubacterium ruminantium. Those often exhibiting intermediate sensitivities included Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Selenomonas ruminantium, and Megasphera elsdenii, while Streptococcus bovis was very refractory to all elements tested. Rumen fluid provided a modest protective effect for the bacteria.
TI  - Gentamicin-based medium for the isolation of group D streptococci and application of the medium to water analysis.
AB  - Gentamicin-thallous-carbonate (GTC) medium contained (per liter): 40.0 g of Trypticase soy agar, 5.0 g of KH(2)PO(4), 2.0 g of NaHCO(2), 1.0 g of glucose, 1.0 g of esculin, 0.5 g of thallous acetate (TA), 0.5 g of ferric citrate, 0.75 ml of Tween 80, and 2.5 mg of gentamicin sulfate. The NaHCO(3) (20 ml of a 10% solution that had been heated to boiling) was added after sterilization of the basal medium. The spread plate technique was used to compare GTC agar with Pfizer selective enterococcus, TA, and KF agars by using sewage as well as bovine and swine fecal samples. Significantly greater numbers of group D streptococci were recovered on GTC agar than on Pfizer selective enterococcus or KF agars, within and over all samples. Higher counts also were obtained on GTC than on TA agar, but the differences were not statistically significant. The percentage of false positives was about the same for all four media. Samples of riverwater also were plated on GTC, TA, and KF agars, and significantly higher recoveries were obtained with GTC agar. GTC agar was superior to the other media examined primarily because of increased recoveries of Streptococcus bovis and S. equinus; other advantages of GTC agar were large colony size and short (24-h) incubation period. The percentage of false positives from riverwater was 13% for GTC agar and 0% for TA and KF agars; therefore, confirmation would be necessary when GTC agar is used with some types of environmental samples.

AB  
TI  - Contribution to the taxonomy of haemolytic corynebacteria.
AB  - In an attempt to assess the taxonomic relationships among human (Corynebacterium  haemolyticum), animal (Corynebacterium pyogenes bovis) haemolytic corynebacteria, typical corynebacteria (Corynebacterium diphteriae mitis, C. ovis, C. ulcerans) and group A and G streptococci, a number of biochemical parameters were established: the DNA content of G + C, the presence of the cytochrome system, composition of fatty acids in free lipids and production of carboxylic acids as end products of fermentation. It was found that according to the above criteria, streptococci differed significantly from the corynebacteria studied. In addition, it was possible to differentiate a subgroup of typically aerobic haemolytic corynebacteria (different from both human and animal corynebacteria), possessing a complete cytochrome system, producing propionic acid and having a different composition of fatty acids.
TI  - Determination of the sugar sequences and the glycosidic-bond arrangements of immunogenic heteroglycans.
AB  - The complete sugar sequences and glycosidic-bond arrangements have been determined by a combined analytical scheme for a diheteroglycan of D-glucose and D-galactose and a tetraheteroglycan of 6-deoxy-L-talose, L-rhamnose, D-galactose, and D-glucuronic acid. The analytical scheme included methylation analysis by g.l.c. and mass spectrometry, periodate oxidation followed by borohydride reduction and identification of the residual fragments, enzymic hydrolysis followed by characterization of the modified glycan, and chemical degradation followed by characterization of the resulting fragments. The diheteroglycan and the tetraheteroglycan are immunogenic substances on the cell surface of the organisms, and are the group specific carbohydrates in the cell walls of Streptococcus faecalis, strain N, and Streptococcus bovis, strain C3. The combined analytical scheme should be of general applicability for the structural analysis of heteroglycans for which selective-degradation procedures can be devised.
TI  - Generation rates of faecal streptococci in various vehicles.
AB  - Potassium tellurite media gave the highest detrimental effects on the generation  number of all tested faecal streptococci species. This applies to all investigated vehicles. However, drastic tellurite effects became more conspicuous with certain vehicles than with others. This is particularly true with acid and alkaline foods and water, especially with strains like Streptococcus bovis, Str. faecium, and Str. durans. Again, tellurite becomes more influencial with regard to old cells rather than young cells in the logarithmic phase. On the other hand, the use of thallous acetate as a concentration agent secured better results than either the tellurite or azide almost with all tested vehicles. Yet, sodium azide may be regarded as holding an intermediate position between tellurite and thallous acetate in terms of vehicles, Streptococcus species, and age of pollution. A lower number of generation resulted with all tested faecal streptococci species, using liquid media bearing more than one concentrating agent. This applied to water and milk examination.

TI  - Binding of lectins to Streptococcus mutans cells and type-specific polysaccharides, and effect on adherence.
AB  - The lectin concanavalin A (Con A) agglutinated the cells of 13 of 15 strains of the seven serotypes of Streptococcus mutans in an 18-h incubation period. Strains of types a, d, f, and g agglutinated within 2 h. Strains of a, d, and f were also agglutinated in 2 h by the castor bean lectin RCA. S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. bovis, Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii, and Lactobacillus plantarum were agglutinated within 2 h. The S. mutans type f polysaccharide was precipitated by Con A. The a, b, c, d, and e polysaccharides were not precipitated. Glucan from d and e strains of S. mutans and dextran T2000 were also precipitated by Con A. D-glucose inhibited the agglutination of type f cells by Con A and the agglutination of type d cells by D-galactose. The quantity of [acetyl-3H]Con A bound was not proportional to the degree of agglutination. Cells grown in sucrose medium bound more Con A than those grown in glucose medium. After treatment with dextranase, the sucrose-grown cells bound two- to fourfold more Con A. The binding of Con A to the type-specific polysaccharide or to teichoic acid could not be determined by the use of specific antibody due to the binding of Con A to the antibody globulin on the cell surface. Con A bound to S. mutans cells did not inhibit the activity of cell-bound glucosyltransferase, glucan synthesis, and in vitro adherence. Bound Con A also did not inhibit the ability of heat-treated cells to bind glucosyltransferase, synthesize glucan, and produce in vitro adherence.
TI  - Changes in the microflora and physiology of the anterior intestinal tract of pigs weaned at 2 days, with special reference to the pathogenesis of diarrhea.
AB  - The gastrointestinal microflora and gastric physiology of piglets weaned at 2 days was compared with that of piglets allowed to continue sucking the sow. Although there was a significantly higher count of Escherichia coli in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum of the early-weaned compared with sow-reared pigs, these differences were not detectable in samples from the ileum. There were no quantitative differences in lactobacilli and in streptococci between the two treatments. Lactobacillus fermentum, L. acidophilus, Streptococcus salivarius, S. bovis, and related biotypes were isolated from both groups of pigs. L. fermentum and S. salivarius were isolated more frequently from sow-reared piglets. The weight of digesta in the stomach was greater in weaned than in sucking pigs and was even greater in scouring weaned pigs, suggesting that in scouring pigs there may be gastric stasis. The gastric pH was higher in the weaned pigs at 4 days of age, but gradually decreased up to 10 days, during which time the lactic acid concentration rose. In weaned pigs there was a highly significant negative correlation between pH and lactic acid concentration in the stomach digesta, and also a positive correlation between pH and number of E. coli. These correlations suggest that lactic acid, from bacterial fermentation, is the major component in the regulation of gastric pH in weaned pigs. Three of twenty sucking pigs, but none of the weaned pigs, were secreting HCl (chloride concentration > 3 mg/g, pH < 3.5). In sucking pigs there was an inverse relationship between the chloride and lactic acid concentrations in the digesta. In weaned scouring pigs there was a nonsignificant increase in pepsin concentration in the stomach tissue. There was a threefold increase in the total proteolytic activity of the stomach tissue.
TI  - Association of Streptococcus bovis with carcinoma of the colon.
AB  - Two patients with colonic adenocarcinoma and Streptococcus bovis endocarditis suggested a possible association between the two. Non-enterococcal Group D streptococci were isolated from fecal cultures of 11 of 105 controls, 35 of 63 patients with carcinoma of the colon, seven of 25 with inflammatory bowel disease, four of 21 with non-colonic neoplasms and five of 37 with other gastrointestinal disorders. All such streptococci examined for lactose fermentation were S. bovis. The prevalence of S. bovis in fecal cultures from patients with carcinoma of the colon was significantly increased (P less than 0.001) as compared to that in controls, and also to all other groups (P less than 0.001). No other group had results significantly different from those of controls (P less than 0.05) although patients with inflammatory bowel disease were more frequently carriers. The carrier state was unrelated to age, hospitalization status, colonic stasis, gastrointestinal bleeding or recent barium-enema examination. The implications of this association are unknown.
TI  - Vancomycin.
AB  - Vancomycin, a useful bactericidal antibiotic for selective clinical infections, is the therapy of choice for serious staphylococcal infections when the penicillins and cephalosporins cannot be used. The antibacterial spectrum of vancomycin also covers other gram-positive cocci and bacteria and gram-negative cocci. Vancomycin is given intravenously in most cases, usually in a dose of 1 g every 12 hours in patients who have normal renal function. The indications for vancomycin therapy are as follows. 1. Serious staphylococcal infections in patients who are intolerant to the penicillins and cephalosporins or when the organism is resistant to the commonly used bactericidal agents. 2. Streptococcal endocarditis in patients intolerant to penicillin G; in enterococcal infections, it is used with an associated aminoglycoside. Vancomycin is not used alone in enterococcal endocarditis. In nonenterococcal (Streptococcus bovis) and viridans streptococcal endocarditis, vancomycin may be used alone if the minimum bactericidal concentration is less than or equal to 10 microgram/ml; otherwise, it is combined with an aminoglycoside. 3. Other serious infections caused by organisms resistant to the commonly used agents such as corynebacterial endocarditis. 4. Acute staphylococcal ileocolitis, for which vancomycin is given orally or orally and intravenously if indicated. Vancomycin is relatively nontoxic; the predominant toxic response is neurotoxicity, but this is rarely seen if the serum levels are 30 microgram/ml or less.
TI  - Isolation of Streptococcus equinus from non-respiratory sources in children.
AB  - Streptococcus equinus, a non-enterococcal streptococcus, was isolated with increased frequency in a pediatric population.
TI  - The effect of adsorption on the acid production of caries and noncaries-producing streptococci.
AB  - Eighteen different Streptococcus strains including S mutans, sanguis, mitis, salivarius, bovis, and 2F2, were assayed for their relative adsorption to synthetic hydroxyapatite and for quantities of lactic acid produced while in the adsorbed state. The results indicated that all S mutans and some S sanguis have an enhanced metabolic activity while adsorbed to hydroxapatite as compared to control suspensions without hydroxyapatite.
TI  - [Lactobacilli of freshwater fishes].
AB  - Normal microflora in the intestinal tract of fishes inhabiting fresh-water reservoirs includes lactic bacteria. The number of the bacteria depends on the animal species, the composition of food, the age, and the season. The highest number of these microorganisms (hundreds of millions per gram of the intestinal content) is found in carps. Enterococci are most often encountered in fishes inhabiting ponds: Streptococcus faecalis Andrewes a. Horder, Str. faecium Orla-Jensen, Str. bovis Orla-Jensen. Lactobacilli are more typical of fishes in water reserviors: Lactobacillus plantarum (Orla-Jensen) Bergey et al., L. casei (Orla-Jensen) Hansen a. Lessel, L. casei var. casei, L. casei var. rhamnosus, L. Casei var. alactosus, L. leichmannii (Henneberg) Bergey et al., L. acidophillus (Moro) Hansen a. Mocquot, L. Fermenti Beijerinck, L. cellobiosus Rogosa et al., L. Buchneri (Henneberg) Bergey et al. The content of lactic bacteria varies in water reservoirs; their highest content is found in ooze (tens of thousands per gram).
TI  - [Permeability of cutaneous macrophage lysosomal membrane in delayed hypersensitivity to streptococcal antigens].
AB  - The acid phosphatase (APh) was studied in the skin macrophage lysosomes of animals with delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) to the antigens of group A streptococci or tuberculoproteins. The histochemical procedure for the APh determination was employed in the skin sections without any preliminary tissue fixation. Intradermal injection of specific antigens in DTH proved to lead to the increase of the lysosomal membrane permeability in the skin macrophages. These data support the supposition that the lysosome enzymes of macrophages can act as factors causing tissue destruction in DTH.
TI  - Characterization of the predominant bacteria occurring in the rumen of goats (Capra hircus).
AB  - A total of 44 strains of bacteria were isolated from rumen contents of the goat.  Based on morphology, Gram stain, anaerobiosis, motility, and fermentation end products, they were grouped into 11 different types. For each type, all or representative strains were characterized in detail. The type, number of strains characterized over total number of strains, and identification were as follows: type 1, 6/21, atypical Butyrivibrio fibriosolvens; type 2, 6/9, atypical Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens; type 3, 3/3, genus uncertain; type 4, 2/2, genus uncertain; type 5, 3/3, Streptoccous bovis; type 6, 1/1, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens; type 7, 1/1, Bacteroides ruminicola subsp. ruminicola; type 8, 1/1, Bacteroides ruminicola subsp. brevis; type 9, 1/1, family Peptococcaceae, genus uncertain; type 10, 1/1, genus Bacteroides; type 11, 1/1, genus Bacteroides. About 70% of the isolated strains were classified as Butyrivibrio, which is quite high compared with previous studies in cattle on similar rations. Of the 30 strains listed as type 1 and 2, the 12 studied further were characterized as atypical Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, which differed from the species description primarily by their inability to hydrolyze starch and lack of gas production.
TI  - Infective endocarditis caused by Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Members of the viridans group of streptococci are the commonest causes of bacterial endocarditis. However, Streptococcus mutans, a member of this group associated with dental caries which might be expected to be commonly associated with endocarditis, has only rarely been reported. This is possibly because of difficulties in isolation and identification. Differing blood culture media may affect the chances of isolation of these organisms, and, though brain-heart infusion, thiol, tryptic soy, and glucose-brain infusion broths have all proved satisfactory, subcultures may require increased CO2 concentrations for growth. Plemorphism in the resultant colonies and in the individual organisms may give rise to a hazardous misinterpretation of this appearance as contamination. Strep. mutans and the similarly penicillin sensitive Strep. bovis may be differentiated from the penicillin resistant enterococci by their lincomycin sensitivity and intolerance of 6-3 per cent sodium chloride. Precise differentiation of streptococci in bacterial endocarditis is of value both epidemiologically and in the management of the disease.
TI  - Glucose-1-phosphate as a selective substrate for enumeration of Bacteroides species in the rumen.
AB  - When glucose-1-phosphate was used as the only added energy source in a selective  roll tube medium, colony counts for rumen contents ranged from 17.8 to 84.8% of the total culturable count. Percentages were highest in rumen contents from sheep fed high-concentrate rations. From a total of 73 cultures isolated from glucose-1-phosphate roll rubes, only 15.1% were presumptively identified as Bacteroides species. Strains presumptively identified as Butyrivibrio, Selenomonas, Treponema, Streptococcus bovis, and Lachnospira also fermented glucose-1-phosphate. Thus, glucose-1-phosphate would not be useful as a selective substrate for isolation or enumeration of Bacteroides species from the rumen.
TI  - Succession of Streptococcus bovis strains with differing bacteriophage sensitivities in the rumens of two fistulated sheep.
AB  - The bacteriophage sensitivity of the Streptococcus bovis population resident in the rumens of two fistulated sheep was monitored for 112 days. During this time, three changes in the bacteriophage sensitivity of S. bovis occurred in the absence of detectable bacteriophages. Identical changes in bacteriophage sensitivity occurred simultaneously in both animals and, except for the relatively short periods of changeover in phage sensitivity, the S. bovis population in the rumens of the two sheep was homogeneous with respect to phage sensitivity.
TI  - Teichoic acids of group D streptococci with special reference to strains from pig meningitis (Streptococcus suis).
AB  - Immunoelectrophoresis revealed in phenol extracts from S. faecalis and S. faecium a mixture of free and lipid-bound teichoic acids, both reactive with Group D antisera. In phenol extracts from S. suis only lipid-bound teichoic acid, also reactive with Group D antiserum, was seen. This difference probably accounts for the low yield of Group D antigen from S. suis as compared with S. faecalis and S. faecium when heating at pH 2 is used for extraction. When phenol is used good yields are obtained from S. suis as well as from S. faecalis and S. faecium. Lipoteichoic acids from S. faecalis and S. faecium have a backbone structure the same as or similar to that of Group A streptococcal teichoic acid. Lipoteichoic acid from S. suis has a structure differing from that of S. faecalis and S. faecium, e.g., possibly in the attachment of its glucosyl substituents. Precipitation reactions between S. suis lipoteichoic acid and Group D antisera were specifically inhibited by glucose. Reactions between S. bovis phenol extracts and some Group D antisera were also specifically inhibited by glucose, but extracts from S. faecalis and S. faecium were not. This may indicate a monosaccharide glucosyl substituent in teichoic acid from S. suis and S. bovis instead of the di- or trisaccharide previously postulated as the glucosyl substituent in the teichoic acid of S. faecalis.
TI  - The species of viridans streptococci associated with microbial endocarditis: incidence and antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  - Streptococcal endocarditis has been well recognized for decades and over the years investigators at The New York Hospital have defined many of the diagnostic and therapeutic modalities currently employed in patients with this disease. In this study, speciation of the viridans streptococci has provided new insights into the relative frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of these organisms. Indeed, recent studies also suggest that S. milleri endocarditis is associated with a high incidence of suppurative complications and that patients with S. bovis endocarditis may have a significant incidence of underlying but asymptomatic lower gastrointestinal malignancies. Further studies correlating viridans streptococcal species with other clinical and laboratory parameters of endocarditis should provide additional insights into this disease.
TI  - Enhancement of antileukemic effect in combination of 5-fluorouracil and OK-432.
AB  - OK-432, a streptococcal preparation with potent antitumor activity, has been evaluated for its efficacy in experimental and clincal trials. This preparation, however, was ineffective against mouse L1210 leukemia in all treatment schedules. The results of this study indicate that treatments with OK-432 and nucleic acid antimetabolites, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), exert a synergistic effect against L1210 leukemia probably in conjunction with the immunologic defenses of the host. This therapeutic synergism was to some extent dependent on the dose level of 5-FU and was not produced against the 5-FU-resistant L1210 subline. In mice pre-treated with OK-432 prior to the leukemia implantation, there was no synergistic effect as a result of post-treatment with 5-FU. When BDF mice had previously received X-ray irradiation or administration of corticosteroids, the synergism could not be expected either. Comparative combination therapy with BCG or group C streptococcus resulted in failure to produce therapeutic synergism in this system.
TI  - Tetrahydrofolate-dependent biosynthesis of ribothymidine in transfer ribonucleic  acids of Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Trimethoprim, an inhibitor that prevents tetrahydrofolate-dependent transmethylation reactions inbacteria, was used in a comparative study to discriminate between two possible biosynthetic pathways, either the S-adenosylmethionine or the tetrahydrofolate-dependent formation of ribothymidine (rT) in transfer ribonucleic acids (tRNA's) of several strains of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. rT-deficient tRNA's accumulate in trimethoprim-treated gram-positive Streptococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium bovis, Arthrobacter albidus, and all examined Bacillaceae, except Bacillus stearothermophilus. The rT-deficient rT-deficient tRNA's accept the methyl moiety from S-adenosylmethionine in vitro, with extracts from Escherichia coli (wild type) as a source of methylating enzymes; 90% of the incorporated methyl groups are present in rT. Trimethoprim does not inhibit the biosynthesis of rT in tRNA of gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae, Rhizobium lupini, and Pseudomonadaceae, suggesting that the rT-specific tRNA methyltransferases of these gram-negative strains use S-adenosylmethionine as coenzyme.
TI  - Susceptibility of viridans streptococci of 27 antimicrobial agents.
AB  - One hundred and eighty strains of viridans Streptococci (Str. mitis, Str. salivarius, Str. MG, Str. SBE, Str. bovis, Str. equinus and Str. uberis) were isolated from mouth and upper respiratory tract secretions of humans at random in different parts of Poland. These strains were tested for susceptibility to 27 antimicrobial agents. Analysis of results was performed with special reference to bacterial endocarditis, which is caused mostly by these microorganisms. At low minimal inhibitory concentrations, most effective antibiotics appeared amoxycillin, clindamycin, azidocillin, cephaloridine, ampicillin, erythromycin and penicillin G. Susceptibility to other penicillins and cephalosporins was much less pronounced. Small part of strains was highly susceptible to tetracyclines, whereas all other antimicrobial agents were practically ineffective.

TI  - Streptococci and aerococci associated with systemic infection in man.
AB  - A collection of 820 isolates of streptococci and aerococci from human blood or internal organs was classified by means of a set of cultural and biochemical tests. Of these, 719 (712 streptococci and 7 aerococci) were from patients believed to be suffering from a systemic infection: endocarditis 317; a purulent lesion in an internal organ ("purulent disease") 152; bacteriaemia 250. The endocarditis streptococci included members of all recognisable taxa, but only certain of these were common: Streptococcus sanguis, 16-4%; dextran-positive and usually mannitol-fermenting strains of S. bovis (S. bovis I), 15-1%; S. mutans, 14-2%; S. mitior, 13-2%. Streptococci of the "alpha-haemolytic" taxa (S. sanguis, S. mitior and related strains) formed only 44-8% of the total. When the percentage frequency of streptococcal taxa among the endocarditis and "non-endocarditis" isolates was compared, the dextran-forming taxa (S. mutans, S. bovis I, S. sanguis, and dextran-positive streptococci otherwise resembling S. mitior) all had higher "endocarditis : non-endocarditis" ratios than did any of the non-dextran-producing taxa. Endocarditis increased in frequency with age, and showed an excess of males over females up to the age of 65 years. In young patients (less than 35 years), "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci predominated; with increasing age, the proportion of other streptococci increased progressively but the absolute numbers of isolations of "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci did not fall. Infections with S. mutans were prominent in the age-group 35-54 years and with S. bovis I at ages greater than or equal to 55 years. A history of previous heart disease was more often obtained in endocarditis due to "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci than in other streptococcal endocarditis. The streptococcus most often isolated from purulent lesions in internal organs was S. milleri (29-3%). It was associated with brain abscess, meningitis, pleural empyema and a variety of intra-abdominal abscesses. The only common predisposing factor in endocarditis was previous heart damage. In other systemic streptococcal diseases, other general or local predisposing causes could be observed, mainly in infections with the "pyogenic" groupable streptococci, the enterococci and S. milleri.
TI  - [Biological properties of Streptococcus bovis bacteriophages isolated from lysogenic cultures and sheep rumen].
AB  - Biological characteristics of eleven phages for Streptococcus bovis were investigated; seven phage were isolated from ovine rumen and four were virulent mutants of temperate phages of lysogenic cultures. The phages had many properties in common: similar morphology of negative colonies, the identical spectrum of lytic action, related antigens, absolute or high requirement of calcium ions, thermolability, and inactivation by the content of the rumen. Their susceptibility to the inactivating action of acetic acid, urea and temperature was however different. Chloroform and phenol may be used during purification and conservation of the phages.
TI  - Bacteriocins of Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - Forty-seven strains of Streptococcus bovis were tested for bacteriocin production. Fourteen were found to produce bacteriocins, while all 47 were sensitive to at least one of these bacteriocins. The bacteriocins, on the basis of their host range on S. bovis strains, formed six groups. A representative of each group was selected and characterized by temperature stability, sensitivity to trypsin and lipase, sedimentation by centrifugation, ability to pass through dialysis tubing, host range on other bacterial species, and conditions for production in liquid media. A correlation between mannitol fermentation and bacteriocin production was noted.
TI  - Stimulation of lymphocyte proliferation by killed mycobacteria and other bacterial species.
AB  - Killed mycobacteria and some mycobacterial fractions induced spleen cells from normal C3H mice to incorporate tritiated thymidine to a relatively high degree. Thymocytes under the same conditions were not activated. However, incorporation of thymidine was significantly increased when mixtures of thymus and spleen cells were cultured in the presence of the inducers. A similar activation of spleen cells was displayed in the presence of gram-positive and gram-negative non-mycobacterial species.
TI  - Lysogeny in Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - Forty-eight strains of Streptococcus bovis were tested for induction with mitomycin C. Eleven inducible strains were found and the lysates of all 11 contained bacteriophage-like particles. The lysate of one strain also contained large numbers of particles which closely resembled polyheads. Eight of the lysates produced zones of inhibition on indicator strains and viable bacteriophages were detected in six lysates. The sources of the S. bovis were ovine and bovine rumen fluid (23 strains), ovine and bovine feces (5 strains), blood cultures from human endocarditis (8 strains), and a wide variety of other sources (12 strains). Only 1 of 23 rumen S. bovis strains was lysogenic, which suggests that lysogenic S. bovis strains are not an important source of bacteriophages in the rumen.
TI  - Effects of subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics on cross walls of cocci.
AB  - Cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Streptococcus bovis were incubated on membrane filters on agar containing antibiotics at one-third to one-fourth the minimal inhibitory concentration for the particular bacterial strain. S. aureus was grown in the presence of oxacillin, cephaloridine, or lincomycin. N. gonorrhoeae and S. bovis were grown in the presence of penicillin. The membranes were then incubated in drug-free agar, after which viability was determined and the cells were examined by electron microscopy. S. aureus exposed to oxacillin and cephaloridine grew into cells two to seven times larger than normal that contained thick multiple cross walls. S. aureus exposed to lincomycin grew into cells 1.5 to 2 times larger than normal, with multiple thick cross walls and periheral cell walls twice the normal thickness. N. gonorrhoeae cells exposed to penicillin were slightly larger than normal and had cross walls that were up to eight times thicker than normal. After transfer to drug-free agar, cells became smaller, and some normal organisms could be seen. S. bovis incubated in the presence of penicillin grew into filaments that contained no cross walls. Two hours after the return to drug-free agar, filaments with cross walls as well as normal cells were observed. Exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of penicillin did not affect the growth of the peripheral cell wall of S. aureus, N. gonorrhoeae, or S. bovis, but appeared to inhibit lysis of cross walls in S. aureus and N. gonorrhoeae and to inhibit the synthesis of cross walls in S. bovis; that is, the rates of peripheral and cross wall formation differed in their susceptibility to penicillin. These facts suggest that peripheral growth and cross wall formation in cocci are separable processes.
TI  - Arthritogenicity in rats of cell walls from several streptococci staphylococci and two other bacteria.
AB  - Bacterial cell walls from Str. bovis, Str. lactis, Str. mutans, Str. thermophilus, Str. salivarius, and Str. pyogenes were able to produce polyarthritis in rats but Str. faecalis cell walls were nonarthritogenic. S. aureus cell walls produced extremely severe disease. It was also shown that cell walls from S. epidermidis, B. megaterium, and M. lysodeikticus were nonarthritogenic. A close correlation was observed between development of arthritis and the delayed hypersensitivity to bacterial peptidoglycans but not with the PPD hypersensitivity. It was suggested that the adjuvanticity of bacterial cell walls is needed to induce the disease and that arthritogenicity requires a specific antigen in addition to the presence of an adjuvant-inducing agent.
TI  - Characterization of Streptococcus bovis bacteriophages.
AB  - About 25 Streptococcus bovis bacteriophages were isolated from abattoir wastes, bovine rumen fluid, and lysogenic strains of S. bovis. Eight phages were selected and characterized by morphology, stability, rate of adsorption, single-step growth curve, serum neutralization, and antigenic relationship. Two distinct morphological phage types were found, one of which has not been previously reported for group D streptococci.
TI  - Frothy feedlot bloat in cattle: production of extracellular polysaccharides and development of viscosity in cultures of Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis was cultured in a synthetic medium with three concentrations  of sucrose. Initial viscosity of the media was 1.5 centipoise (cp). After incubation for 8 h, the viscosity of the medium with 0.5% sucrose was unchanged, that with 3% sucrose had increased to 8 cp, and that with 6% sucrose to 112 cp. Similar results were found with a rumen fluid medium. A slimy material, responsible for increased viscosity of these cultures, was digested by dextranase. The material appeared as a complex system of intercellular fibers when viewed under the electron microscope after freeze-etching. With proteins and other polymers released from lysed bacteria, this slimy material may contribute directly to increased viscosity and foam formation. In addition to these intercellular fibers, each cell was surrounded by a fibrous capsule that was not digested by dextranase. This capsule stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate, but not with ruthenium red. The amount of capsular material produced was similar whether the media contained 0.5, 3.0, or 6% sucrose.
TI  - Streptoccus mutans dextransucrase: purification, properties, and requirement for  primer dextran.
AB  - We attempted to purify dextransucrase from S mutans strain 6715 to investigate its properties and determine if multiple species of the enzyme existed. It was concluded that the properties of this enzyme such as the pH (5.5), temperature (37 C) optimum, and Km for sucrose (3 mM) are very similar to those reported for S sanguis, S bovis, S mutans strain OMZ-176 isozymes, S mutans strain GS-5, and the single dextransucrase purified from S mutans strain HS-6. The IEF enzyme preparation consisted of two enzyme species, possibly differing in their ability to synthesize different dextran linkages. The minor enzyme activity demonstrated a strict primer dependency. Similarly, primer dependency has been reported for dextransucrases from S mutans, S sanguis, and L mesenteroides. S mutans strain 6715 dextransucrase also showed both the insertion and stepwise mechanisms for dextran synthesis. Sucrose was the sole glucose donor, whereas dextran was a specific, highly efficient glucose acceptor. The complex primer kinetics are not fully understood at this time and require further investigation. Without linkage analysis of the products of our enzymes, we can only postulate that each enzyme has a different function in the synthesis of interresidue and interchain alpha1-3 and alpha1-6 bonds. Insoluble dextran synthesis may involve a special enzyme mechanism characteristic of S mutans. This synthesis would require both enzymes, possibly in some aggregated form, with one enzyme synthesizing endogenous primer dextran. This endogeneous primer or some cell wall polysaccharide could stimulate both enzymes to rapidly synthesize heterogeneously linked insoluble dextran.
TI  - Streptococci isolated from bovine intramammary infections.
AB  - Streptococcal isolates from 71 dairy herds considered free of Streptococcus agalactiae were compared with isolates from 1 herd used in bovine mastitis research over a 12-year period. The incidence of streptococci was as follows: Streptococcus uberis, 56.5%; enterococci, 24.2%; Streptococcus dysgalactiae, 9.0%; Streptococcus bovis, 5.1%; unclassified streptococci, 3.1%; Streptococcus agalactiae, 1.5%; and Lancefield group G streptococci, 0.7%. The incidence for these streptococci in the 2 groups was generally the same except for Str bovis and unclassified streptococci. A study of cultural responses in numerous mediums indicated that differentiation of streptococci recovered from the bovine udder may be obtained with esculin broth, CAMP test, sodium hippurate broth, 0.1% methylene blue milk, inulin, and raffinose broths.
TI  - Growth and morphology of Streptococcus bovis and of mixed rumen bacteria in the presence of aflatoxin B1, in vitro.
AB  - The metabolism of aflatoxin B1 to other fluorescent compounds was studied in rumen organisms. No fluorescent metabolites were found by chromatographic procedures which separate aflatoxin B1 from them. Rumen bacteria (mixtures and Streptococcus bovis) incubated with aflatoxin B1 grew in long chains whereas cells in control cultures were mainly doublets with some short chains. Growth of mixed rumen bacteria and Streptococcus bovis cultures was inhibited by aflatoxin B1 as measured by change in optical density and by incorporation of [carbon-14] adenine into nucleic acids.
TI  - Distribution of group D streptococci in rivers and streams.
AB  - A study was undertaken to determine sources of bacteriological contamination of rivers as well as the ecology of faecal streptococci in natural and contaminated waters. Media used to characterize and speciate group D streptococci were also evaluated using isolates from the water and sediment. Due to the low concentrations of faecal coliforms (FC) and faecal streptococci (FS) in river water samples, the FC/FS ratio was shown to be of little value in determining sources of contamination. High concentrations of FC and FS from sediment samples gave more credible FC/FS ratios. The actual distribution of group D streptococcal species in rivers and streams was also shown. High concentrations of all division II species (S. faecium, S. faecium var. casseliflavus, and S. faecium var. durans) were found in the water and sediment samples, with S. faecium var. durans comprising 50% of the total number of isolates. Low concentrations of division I group D streptococci (S. faecalis and varieties) were found, while only one isolation of division III group D streptococci (S. bovis and S. equinus) was made.
TI  - Effects of estrus and exogenous estrogen on circulating neutrophils and milk somatic cell concentration, neutrophil phagocytosis, and occurrence of clinical mastitis in cows.
AB  - In a study involving 56 quarters (14 cows), it was seen that standing estrus did  not affect circulating neutrophil and milk somatic cell concentrations, neutrophil phagocytosis, milk production, or occurrence of clinical mastitis. The subcutaneous injection of 17beta-estradiol (E2) (0.05 mg/kg of body weight 2 times daily for 2 consecutive days) did not affect neutrophil phagocytosis or milk somatic cell values. However, a significant increase in circulating neutrophils and a significant decrease in milk production were observed. The injection of E2 was followed by clinical mastitis in 4 uninfected quarters, in 7 quarters infected with Corynebacterium bovis, and in 1 quarter infected with Streptococcus uberis and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Selective adhesion of microorganisms to the ductular epithelium of the bovine mammary gland.
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Corynebacterium bovis were examined for their ability to adhere to the ductular epithelial cells of the bovine udder. S. agalactiae and S. aureus adhered readily and in large numbers, whereas the other organisms adhered poorly or not at all. The organisms showing the ability to adhere are those which frequently cause mastitis. These data suggest that selective adherence to the ductular epithelium may be the first stage in the pathogenesis of streptococcal and staphylococcal mastitis.
TI  - Regulation of lactate dehydrogenase and change of fermentation products in streptococci.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans JC 2 produced mainly lactate as a fermentation product when  grown in nitrogen-limited continuous culture in the presence of an excess of glucose and produced formate, acetate, and ethanol, but no lactate, under glucose-limited conditions. The levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in these cultures were of the same order of magnitude, and the activity of LDH was completely dependent on fructose-1,6-diphosphate (FDP). The intracellular level of FDP was high and the level of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) was low under the glucose-excess conditions. In the glucose-limited cultures, all glycolytic intermediates studied, except PEP, were low. S. mutans FIL, which had an FDP-independent LDH and similar levels of glycolytic intermediates as S. mutans JC2, produced mainly lactate under glucose-excess or under glucose-limited conditions. LDH of Streptococcus bovis ATCC 9809 was dependent on FDP for activity at a low concentration of pyruvate but had a significant activity without FDP at a high concentration of pyruvate. This strain also produced mainly lactate both under glucose-excess and glucose-limited conditions. The levels and characteristics of these LDHs were not changed by the culture conditions. These results indicate that changes in the intracellular level of FDP regulate LDH activity, which in turn influences the type of fermentation products produced by streptococci. PEP, adenosine 5'-monophosphate, adenosine 5'-diphosphate, and inorganic phosphate significantly inhibited LDH activity from S. mutans JC 2 and may also participate in the regulation of LDH activity in other streptococci.
TI  - Glucose-6-phosphate-dependent pyruvate kinase in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Pyruvate kinase of Streptococcus mutans JC 2 had an absolute and specific requirement for glucose-6-phosphate. Inorganic phosphate was a strong inhibitor. The enzyme required K+ or NH4+ and Mg2+ or Mn2+. S. mutans FIL and E 49, Streptococcus bovis ATCC 9809, and Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419 had also glucose-6-phosphate-dependent pyruvate kinases, whereas Streptococcus sanguis NCTC 10904 had an enzyme activated by fructose-1,6-diphosphate.
TI  - [Kinetics of setting up of a human fecal flora in germ free mice and trial of decontamination of antibiotherapy (author's transl)].
AB  - We have tried in this study to reproduce in germfree mice a bacterial equilibrium observed previously in the gastrointestinal tract of child "L.N.", reared in a plastic isolator. Eight bacterial strains were studied. Seven had been fortuitously introduced: Acinetobacter lwoffi LN1, Staphylococcus epidermidis LN2, Clostridium perfringens LN3, Plectridium anatum LN4, Streptococcus bovis LN5, Enterobacter cloacae LN6, Corynebacterium sp LN7. The eighth strain was purposely administered to the child in order to take advantage of an antagonism between this strain and spontaneously acquired flora. This strain is Bacillus licheniformis FD1. The gnotoxenic mice proved to be a good experimental model because we found their bacterial equilibrium comparable to that observed in child L.N. In addition, we studied the decontamination procedures of the gastrointestinal tract of mice by observing both the antagonism of B. licheniformis with bacitracin, and the action of a suitable mixture of antibiotics. Conditions for the realization of this decontamination are discussed in this study.
TI  - Membrane filter technique for enumeration of enterococci in marine waters.
AB  - A membrane filter procedure is described for the enumeration of enterococci in marine waters. The procedure utilizes a highly selective and somewhat differential primary isolation medium followed by an in situ substrate test for identifying colonies of those organisms capable of hydrolyzing esculin. The procedure (mE) was evaluated with known streptococci strains and field samples with regard to its accuracy, sensitivity, selectivity, precision, and comparability to existing methods. Essentially quantitative recovery was obtained with seawater-stressed cells of Streptococcus faecalis and S. faecium. Neither S. bovis, S. equinus, S. mitis, nor S. salivarius grew on the medium. The selectivity of the medium was such that a 10,000-fold reduction in background organisms was obtained relative to a medium which contained no inhibitors and was incubated at 35 C. About 90% of those typical colonies designated as enterococci confirmed as such and about 12% of the colonies not so designated were, in fact, identified as enterococci. Plate to plate variability across samples approximated that expected by chance alone. Verified recoveries of enterococci from natural samples by the mE procedure, on the average, exceeded those by the KF method by one order of magnitude.
TI  - Isolation and identification of rumen bacteria capable of anaerobic phloroglucinol degradation.
AB  - Eight strains of rumen bacteria capable of degrading phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene) under anaerobic conditions were isolated from enrichment cultures of the bovine rumen microflora established in a prereduced medium containing 0.02 M phloroglucinol. Five of the strains were facultatively anaerobic Gram-positive streptococci which were identified as Streptococcus bovis. Three strains of obligately anaerobic Gram-positive cocci were assigned to the genus Coprococcus. Anaerobic cultures of the Streptococcus bovis strains in a 40% rumen fluid medium initially containing 0.02 M phloroglucinol degraded 50-80% of the substrate within 2 days, whereas cultures of the Coprococcus strains degraded more than 80% of the substrate under the same conditions. The Streptococcus bovis strains were incapable of degrading phloroglucinol in brain heart infusion or in the medium of de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe (MRS broth) incubated aerobically.
TI  - Meningitis caused by Streptococcus in adults.
AB  - Meningitis caused by Streptococcus is uncommon in adults. Otitis media, mastoiditis, sinusitis, or trauma has antedated most cases reported in the past. Data on 10 recent cases suggest changes in the current pathogenesis of streptococcal meningitis in adults and emphasize the importance of accurate streptococcal speciation. Endocarditis was present in five cases; trauma played a role in two others. Brain abscess, corticosteroids, alcoholic cirrhosis, and peritonitis secondary to chronic peritoneal dialysis were etiologic factors in five patients. Otitis media, mastoiditis, and sinusitis were conspicuously absent. Streptococcus agalctiae accounted for purulent meningitis in two postmenopausal women. Both strains of group B Streptococcus were bacitracin-sensitive and were thus mislabeled group A. Recognition of Streptococcus bovis spared two patients unnecessary aminoglycoside adminstration. Nine of the 10 patients survived, including a women with prosthetic mitral valve endocarditis and a man with a ruptured brain abscess. Differentiation of these streptococci from Streptococcus pneumoniae was seldon possible on the basis of the spinal fluid gram stain alone.
TI  - Susceptibility of various serogroups of streptococci to clindamycin and lincomycin.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentration of lincomycin and clindamycin for a large number of strains from multiple serogroups of streptococci was determined. The median minimal inhibitory concentration for streptococci from groups A, B, C, F, G, H, L, and M and nongroupable organisms ranged from 0.02 to 0.39 mug of lincomycin per ml and from </=0.01 to 0.09 mug of clindamycin per ml. Among the group D strains, Streptococcus faecium and Streptococcus faecalis were resistant to lincomycin and clindamycin, whereas Streptococcus bovis and four American strains of Streptococcus durans resembled nongroup D isolates in their susceptibility to these agents. Occasional strains of nongroup D streptococci were highly resistant to lincomycin and clindamycin.
TI  - Presumptive speciation of Streptococcus bovis and other group D streptococci from human sources by using arginine and pyruvate tests.
AB  - A simplified method for speciation of group D streptococci is described. A total  of 4,156 streptococcal isolates from human clinical material was tested for ability to hydrolyze esculin in the presence of 40% bile, ferment pyruvate, hydrolyze arginine, and grow in media containing 40% bile or 6.5% NaCl. Streptococci which hydrolyzed esculin in 40% bile, but which did not hydrolyze arginine, were also tested for their ability to ferment raffinose or sorbose. Sixty percent (2,503) of the isolates hydrolyzed esculin in the presence of 40% bile and were thus presumptively identified as group D. By application of the other criteria, 84% of these were speciated as Streptococcus faecalis, 7% were speciated as S. faecium, 6% were speciated as S. bovis, 2% were speciated as S. avium, and 1% were not identified. This scheme was shown to be both reliable and practical for use in the diagnostic laboratory. S. avium and S. bovis isolates were characterized, and 18 S. bovis isolates from patients with bacterial endocarditis were compared physiologically with 151 isolates of this species from other sources.
TI  - Evaluation of selective media for enumeration of group D streptococci in bovine feces.
AB  - Eight commercially available selective media were evaluated by the membrane filter technique. Enterococcosel broth (BBL) consistently gave the best recovery of group D streptococci, particularly of Streptococcus bovis.
TI  - Nonenterococcal group-D streptococcal endocarditis caused by Streptococcus bovis.
AB  
TI  - Streptococcus bovis endocarditis.
AB  - A case is described of bacterial endocarditis caused by Lancefield group D Streptococcus bovis. Because of its sensitivity to the less toxic antibiotics such as penicillin, the importance of laboratory differentiation from the more resistant enterococci is emphasized. Treatment in this case was complicated by penicillin allergy and cardiac failure. The condition finally responded to clindamycin therapy and aortic valve replacement.
TI  - Endocarditis due to group D streptococci. Comparison of disease caused by streptococcus bovis with that produced by the enterococci.
AB  
TI  - Comparative survival of indicator bacteria and enteric pathogens in well water.
AB  - The comparative survival of various fecal indicator bacteria and enteric pathogens was studied in a stable well water supply by using membrane chambers. There was more variation in the 29 coliform cultures and they died more rapidly, as a group, than the 20 enterococcus cultures that were examined. The comparative survival of the organisms tested follows: Aeromonas sp. > the shigellae (Shigella flexneri, S. sonnei, and S. dysenteriae) > fecal streptococci > coliforms = some salmonellae (Salmonella enteritidis ser. paratyphi A and D, S. enteritidis ser. typhimurium) > Streptococcus equinus > Vibrio cholerae > Salmonella typhi > Streptococcus bovis > Salmonella enteritidis ser. paratyphi B. S. bovis had a more rapid die-off than did S. equinus, but both had significantly shorter half-lives than the other streptococci. The natural populations of indicator bacteria from human and elk fecal material declined similarly to the pure cultures tested, whereas the die-off of fecal streptococci exceeded the coliforms from bovine fecal material.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of Streptococcus bovis and other group D streptococci causing endocarditis.
AB  - Seventy-four strains of Streptococcus bovis and 35 strains of enterococci (Streptococcus faecalis and its varieties, Streptococcus faecium and Streptococcus durans), most of which were isolated from patients with endocarditis, were tested for their susceptibility to penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin, cephalothin, vancomycin, methicillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, streptomycin, and gentamicin. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were determined by a microtiter broth dilution technique. All of these organisms are group D streptococci, but the S. bovis strains are not enterococci. On the basis of both MIC and MBC, the S. bovis strains were much more susceptibile in general to antibiotics then were the enterococcal strains. For the S. bovis strains, the lowest MICs were obtained with penicillin, ampicillin, and erythromycin, and the lowest MBCs with penicillin and ampicillin. Although these antibiotics were also the most active against the enterococci, the MICs and MBCs were much higher than obtained with the S. bovis strains. Gentamicin was the most active aminoglycoside. On the basis of in vitro susceptibility results, the S. bovis strains resemble the viridans streptococci rather than enterococci.

TI  - Shared antigens between heterologous bacterial species.
AB  - Sera from normal rabbits were shown to have antibodies that bound radiolabeled test antigens derived from many taxonomically unrelated bacteria. Sera from rabbits that had been immunized with sonically treated material of 12 different bacteria, including M. bovis strain BCG, had antibodies that bound not only radiolabeled homologous test antigens but also radiolabeled antigens from many unrelated bacteria. Binding by normal and immunized sera to radiolabeled test antigens was inhibited by homologous unlabeled test antigens but not by substances such as bovine serum albumin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sheep erythrocytes, and endotoxin. The broad range of shared or cross-reactivity among antigens in bacteria may explain the presence of antibodies to many bacteria in sera from normal humans and previously unimmunized experimental animals. The presence of these antibodies raises the question whether resistance to many bacterial infections may be partly due to immune mechanisms, whether cellular or humoral, that have been stimulated by unrelated bacteria.

TI  - Recognition of group D streptococcal species of human origin by biochemical and physiological tests.
AB  - The speciation of 262 strains of group D streptococci isolated from human sources is described. One hundred forty-two isolates from blood cultures were included; 96 of these were submitted as isolates from clinical cases of subacute bacterial endocarditis. The results show that 98 Streptococcus faecalis, 29 S. faecalis var. zymogenes, 44 S. faecalis var. liquefaciens, 27 S. faecium, 13 S. durans, 44 S. bovis, and 7 unspeciated S. bovis-like group D isolates were identified. No S. faecium var. casseliflavus, S. equinus, or S. avium (group Q streptococci) were identified among the human isolates. The speciation procedures and techniques are detailed. The procedures and limitations of the tests used are discussed. Ninety-eight percent of the 262 strains were speciated by a spectrum of tests that allowed us to recognize atypical as well as typical strains within species.

TI  - Peptidoglycan composition and taxonomy of group D, E, and H streptococci, and Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The qualitative and quantitative composition of the peptidoglycan from the cell wall of groups D, E, and H streptococci, and Streptococcus mutans, was determined. In group D, S. faecalis and the closely related species S. liquefaciens and S. zymogenes were separated from S. faecium and the closely related species S. durans on the basis of their peptidoglycan composition. A relationship among S. bovis, S. equinus, and some strains of S. mutans was indicated by the presence in each of a similar peptidoglycan containing threonine. Threonine was released from the S. mutans polymer as a threonine-lysine dipeptide. Hydrolysis of the dipeptide at 100 C for 24 hr in 6 n HC1 was required to break the peptide bond. Motile group D streptococci possessed a peptidoglycan of the same composition as S. faecium. Group E and H strains were also similar in the composition of their peptidoglycan. The results demonstrate that peptidoglycan composition can be used to (i) aid in the division of members of an immunological group into subgroups, and (ii) indicate a relationship between members of the same genus which are not related on an immunological basis.
TI  - Comparison of selective media for isolation of presumptive group D streptococci from human feces.
AB  - Pfizer Selective Enterococcus (PSE) agar, a medium containing bile, sodium azide, and esculin, was evaluated for its sensitivity and selectivity for detection and enumeration of presumptive group D streptococci in human feces. SF broth and SF broth plus agar (1.5%), representing selective media in common use, were studied simultaneously. Presumptive group D streptococci were recovered on PSE agar from the feces of all 25 subjects. No growth was observed in 8% of specimens in SF broth. No gram-negative organisms were recovered in any medium. PSE agar has the advantages of selecting out Streptococcus bovis, earlier appearance of distinctive reactions, and lack of requirement for special incubation temperature.

TI  - Extracellular transglucosylase and alpha-amylase of Streptococcus equinus.
AB  - Culture filtrates of Streptococcus equinus 1091 contained alpha-amylase and transglucosylase. The effects of calcium carbonate, age of inoculum, concentration of maltose, and duration of the fermentation on alpha-amylase and transglucosylase production were determined. The extracellular alpha-amylase was purified 48-fold and was free of transglucosylase activity. The alpha-amylase (amylose substrate) required Cl(-) for maximum activity; ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) partially inhibited activity, but CaCl(2) prevented EDTA inhibition. The temperature optimum was 38 C at pH 7.0, and the pH optimum was 7.0 at 37 C in the presence of CaCl(2). Predominant final products of amylose hydrolysis, in order of decreasing prevalence, were maltose, maltotriose, maltotetraose, and glucose. The alpha-amylase showed no evidence of multiple attack. The extracellular transglucosylase was purified 27-fold, but a small amount of alpha-amylase remained. Transglucosylase activity (amylose substrate) was not increased in the presence of CaCl(2). The temperature optimum was 37 C at pH 6.5, and the pH optimum was 6.0 at 37 C. Carbohydrates that served as acceptors for the transglucosylase to degrade amylose were, in order of decreasing acceptor efficiency: d-glucose, d-mannose, l-sorbose, maltose, sucrose, and trehalose. The extracellular transglucosylase of S. equinus 1091 synthesized higher maltodextrins in the medium when the cells were grown in the presence of maltose.

A dipeptide, N(epsilon)-lysylthreonine, was isolated from S. bovis mucopeptide by ion-exchange chromatography. This finding suggests that threonine is associated with the bridge which cross-links adjacent tetrapeptides by connecting the epsilon-amino group of lysine of one tetrapeptide to the carboxyl group of d-alanine of another to form the mucopeptide matrix.

TI  - Lysis of viable rumen bacteria in bovine rumen fluid.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis and Butyrivibrio sp. were labeled with thymidine-methyl-(3)H, washed, and resuspended in rumen fluid or rumen fluid fractions obtained from Holstein and Jersey cows fed alfalfa hay once daily. Factors affecting the lytic activity found in untreated rumen fluid were examined. Day to day variation and differences before and after feeding were observed for the same cow. There were also differences between cows on the same day. For a given rumen fluid, the rate of release of label was roughly proportional to the number of labeled cells present over a 100-fold range in concentration. Removal of protozoa largely abolished the lytic action of fresh rumen fluid for S. bovis, but some soluble lytic activity remained. Mixed rumen protozoa added to media containing labeled S. bovis caused label to appear in solution. In a sample of rumen fluid containing 4.3 x 10(4) protozoa/ml 5.2% of the S. bovis population were destroyed by protozoa per hr. The mean rate of destruction for 12 runs on whole rumen fluid was 8.7% per hr with a standard deviation of 6.05. Parallel experiments with Butyrivibrio indicated that soluble lytic factors were more important for this organism. They could be destroyed by autoclaving and were generated when viable rumen bacteria were resuspended in autoclaved rumen fluid. The lysis of S. bovis and Butyrivibrio, at equal cell densities, by mixed rumen protozoa was compared in 30% rumen fluid media, and Butyrivibrio appeared to be more readily lysed than S. bovis.

AB  - This study demonstrated that 15 species of ruminal bacteria with no previous history of contact with antibiotics are susceptible to bacitracin, chloramphenicol, chlortetracycline, erythromycin, novobiocin, oleandomycin, oxytetracycline, penicillin, tetracycline, tylosin, and vancomycin. A number of the species were not inhibited by kanamycin, neomycin, polymyxin, and streptomycin. The data suggest that antibiotic-resistant cells occur within susceptible cultures of these species. Streptococcus bovis FD-10 and a nonruminal anaerobe, Bacteroides melaninogenicus BE-1, showed similar antibiotic susceptibilities.
TI  - Spherical Lactic Acid-producing Bacteria of Southern-grown Raw and Processed Vegetables.
AB  - The frequency and levels of population of the spherical lactic acid-producing bacteria were determined on raw and processed yellow summer and zucchini squash, a variety of greens, green beans, okra, southern peas, and butter and lima beans, and on fresh cucumbers and corn flowers. Six taxa occurred consistently: Leuconostoc mesenteroides, yellow-pigmented streptococci, Streptococcus faecium, Aerococcus viridans, and S. faecalis and S. faecalis var. liquefaciens. The same taxa occurred with the same order of frequency on processed, frozen vegetables, but with a marked decrease in the occurrence of S. faecalis var. liquefaciens. S. lactis, S. cremoris, S. equinus, S. bovis, and pediococci were isolated infrequently. No other member of the viridans group of the streptococci and no member of the pyogenic group was isolated. Approximately 88% of the cultures were identified. Total counts of the lactic-acid-producing bacteria rarely exceeded 10 per gram of sample, and there was a reduction by 90% during the second year of study, probably because of drought. Only one bacterial species was found on 40% of the raw and 34% of the processed vegetable samples. Two or more species or taxa were present on the remainder of 153 raw and 56 processed vegetable samples. A. viridans was present on squash, greens, okra, and southern peas, and its frequency of occurrence on vegetables suggests that plants are its natural habitat.
TI  - Arginine biosynthesis by Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - The pathway of arginine biosynthesis in Streptococcus bovis was studied by radioactive tracer techniques. Cells were grown anaerobically with (14)CO(2) in a synthetic medium containing NH(4) (+) as the sole nitrogen source except for the trace present in nitrogen-containing vitamins. The protein fraction isolated from the labeled cells was acid-hydrolyzed, and (14)C-arginine was isolated from the protein hydrolysate by ion-exchange chromatography. The carboxyl carbon of the isolated arginine was removed with arginine decarboxylase, and the guanidino carbon was removed by simultaneous arginase-urease degradation. By manometric measurement and liquid scintillation counting of the CO(2) released by enzymatic degradation, 50% of the label was found in the carboxyl carbon and 50% in the guanidino carbon. Specific radioactivity determinations indicated that growth on (14)CO(2) resulted in twice as much label in arginine as with aspartate, glutamate, or lysine. These results are consistent with a glutamate --> ornithine --> citrulline pathway of arginine biosynthesis in S. bovis and provide further evidence for the synthesis of glutamate via the tricarboxylic acid cycle reactions from citrate through alpha-ketoglutarate.

Bacteriol. 92:1321-1330. 1966.-The activities of enzymes representing the major pathways of carbohydrate metabolism and anaerobic electron transport in cell-free extracts of whole rumen contents have been reported. The effects of diet upon the activities of several enzymes suggested that enzymatic measurements might prove useful for the study of rumen metabolism. In the present study, the distribution and characteristics of aldolase, succinate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, lactyl-coenzyme A dehydrase, lactate dehydrogenase, and other enzymes were measured in cell-free extracts of pure cultures of Ruminococcus flavefaciens, R. albus, Bacteroides succinogenes, B. ruminicola, B. amylophilus, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Peptostreptococcus elsdenii, Streptococcus bovis, and Selenomonas ruminantium. Some enzymes were widely distributed (aldolase, glutamate dehydrogenase), whereas others were observed in one or two species (lactyl-coenzyme A dehydrase). The cofactor requirements and kinetic characteristics of enzymes varied considerably with species. Enzymes that vary with species might be employed as indices for estimating the activities of various groups of microorganisms in whole rumen contents.

Bacteriol. 89:1244-1249. 1965.-Intestinal bacteria were isolated from 15 cattle. Approximately 600 isolates were studied, and their presence and numbers in the duodenum, ileum, cecum, and colon were noted. Bacteria most frequently isolated from all parts of the intestinal tract included Escherichia coli, Streptococcus bovis, and species of Bacillus. Several groups of gram-positive rods could not be classified according to Bergey's Manual. Direct counts of intestinal contents indicated that 1 to 10% of the bacteria present were recovered.
TI  - A TRANSGLUCOSYLASE OF STREPTOCOCCUS BOVIS.
AB  - 1. A transglucosylase has been separated from the alpha-amylase of Streptococcus  bovis by chromatography of the cell extract on DEAE-cellulose. 2. The transglucosylase can synthesize higher maltodextrins from maltotriose, but maltose, isomaltose and panose do not function as donors. 3. Iodine-staining polysaccharide may be synthesized from maltotriose provided that glucose is removed. Synthesis from maltohexaose results in dextrins of sufficient chain length to stain with iodine, but again maltodextrins of longer chain length are formed when glucose is removed from the system. 4. The transglucosylase degrades amylose in the presence of a suitable acceptor, transferring one or more glucosyl residues from the non-reducing end of the donor to the non-reducing end of the acceptor. With [(14)C]glucose as acceptor the maltodextrins produced were labelled in the reducing glucose unit only. 5. The acceptor activities of 25 sugars have been compared with that of glucose. Maltose has 50%, methyl alpha-glucoside has 15%, isomaltose and panose each has 8% and sucrose has 6% of the accepting efficiency of glucose. Mannose and sorbose also had detectable activity. With the exception of maltose all these sugars produced a different series of dextrins from that obtained with glucose. 6. It was concluded that S. bovis transglucosylase transfers alpha-(1-->4)-glucosidic linkages in the same manner as D-enzyme, but some differences in specificity distinguish the two enzymes. Unlike D-enzyme, S. bovis transglucosylase can transfer glucosyl units, producing appreciable amounts of maltose both during synthesis from maltotriose and during transfer from amylose to glucose. 7. No evidence was found that the transglucosylase was extracellular. The enzyme is cell-bound, and is released by treatment of the cells with lysozyme and by suspension of the spheroplasts in dilute buffer. 8. The transglucosylase may be responsible for the storage of intracellular iodophilic polysaccharide that occurs when the cells are grown in the presence of suitable carbohydrate sources.
TI  - THE CELL-BOUND ALPHA-AMYLASES OF STREPTOCOCCUS BOVIS.
AB  - 1. The cell-bound alpha-amylase of Streptococcus bovis has been isolated from other carbohydrases in the cell extract by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. The enzyme has been compared with the extracellular alpha-amylase produced by this organism. 2. The two amylases had similar action patterns on amylose, the main product being maltotriose with smaller amounts of maltose and a little glucose. 3. The cell-bound amylase hydrolysed maltopentaose and maltohexaose at a similar rate to the hydrolysis of amylose. Maltotetraose was hydrolysed six times more slowly, and maltotriose 280 times more slowly, than amylose. 4. Studies with end-labelled maltodextrins revealed that the cell-bound alpha-amylase preferentially hydrolysed the third linkage from the non-reducing end, liberating maltotriose. The linkage at the reducing end of maltotriose was more easily hydrolysed than the other. 5. Egg-white lysozyme and the extracellular enzymes of Streptomyces albus lysed the cell walls of Streptococcus bovis, releasing amylase into the medium. In the presence of 0.6 m-sucrose 10% of the maximal amylase activity was released by lysozyme. Suspension of the spheroplasts in dilute buffer caused the rupture of the cytoplasmic membrane and the liberation of amylase. 6. A sensitive method for determining the ability of amylases to degrade starch granules is described.
TI  - FRUCTOSE-1,6-DIPHOSPHATE REQUIREMENT OF STREPTOCOCCAL LACTIC DEHYDROGENASES.
AB  - The lactic dehydrogenase of a strain of Streptococcus bovis specifically requires fructose-1,6-diphosphate for activity. Phosphate or fructose-1-6-diphosphate prevents inactivation of the dehydrogenase, but phosphate and other compounds cannot be substituted for the fructose-1,6-diphosphate required for activity. Lactic dehydrogenases of other species of Streptococcus show a similar requirement for fructose-1,6-diphosphate.

AB  - Burchall, J. J. (University of Illinois, Urbana), R. A. Niederman, and M. J. Wolin. Amino group formation and glutamate synthesis in Streptococcus bovis. J. Bacteriol. 88:1038-1044. 1964.-Extracts of Streptococcus bovis grown on NH(4) (+) as a nitrogen source contain a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP)-linked glutamic dehydrogenase and are devoid of alanine dehydrogenase, other amino acid dehydrohygenases, and aspartase. A potential source of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate for glutamate synthesis is a NADP and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-linked glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase present in the extracts. Experiments with C(14)-labeled glucose and NaHCO(3) indicate that the glutamate carbon skeleton is synthesized by a tricarboxylic acid pathway. The synthesis of the carbon skeleton of glutamate is repressed when glutamate or casein hydrolysate supplement the NH(4) (+)-containing growth medium. Repression of glutamic dehydrogenase and a NAD-linked isocitric dehydrogenase occurs only when complex nitrogen sources, but not when free amino acids, are added to the growth medium.

Bacteriol. 86:1079-1083. 1963.-Dextran synthesis was found to be temperature-dependent in Lactobacillus strain RWM-13. Dextran was not formed above 37 C, although growth of cells occurred up to 42 C. Logarithmically growing cells transferred from 30 C to 40 C ceased producing dextran while growth decreased nominally. An examination of the extracts of cells broken by sonic treatment showed that as the temperature of growth was increased above 37 C the production of dextransucrase decreased. By use of an inhibitor of invertase, 10(-4)m AgNO(3), it was shown that invertase replaced dextransucrase activity at temperatures above 37 C. In contrast to dextransucrase in Leuconostoc mesenteroides, the enzyme in Lactobacillus strain RWM-13 was constitutive and thus resembled that of Streptococcus bovis. Thermosensitivity of dextransucrase synthesis has not been observed in Leuconostoc or Streptococcus.

AB  - Dunican, Lawrence K. (Cornell University, Ithaca, N. Y.) and Harry W. Seeley. Starch hydrolysis by Streptococcus equinus. J. Bacteriol. 82:264-269. 1962.-In a study of starch hydrolysis by strains of Streptococcus equinus, 52 isolates were obtained and their amylolytic abilities determined. It was found that all the strains could hydrolyze starch to some extent when grown in the presence of an easily fermentable carbohydrate, viz., glucose. Without this carbohydrate the organisms did not hydrolyze starch. The hydrolysis of starch was inhibited when the organisms were grown in an atmosphere of 5% CO(2) and 95% N(2), even if grown in the presence of a fermentable monosaccharide. S. bovis, which was used as a reference organism, readily hydrolyzed starch in the absence of monosaccharides and in atmospheres containing CO(2). In no instance did S. equinus hydrolyze the starch to the level of reducing sugars. Negligible amounts of reducing sugars were recovered when the cell-free filtrates of S. equinus were incubated with starch. With S. bovis, the yield of reducing sugars under such conditions was almost quantitative. These facts extend further the differences between these related organisms. The ability to synthesize an internal starchlike polysaccharide was noted in most of the strains of S. equinus. Synthesis was found when the organisms were grown on maltose or on a starch medium containing a small amount of fermentable monosaccharide.
TI  - Species differentiation of group D streptococci.
AB  - Three hundred and fourteen strains of group D streptococci were studied by means  of a number of tests. The majority of the strains were identified as Streptococcus faecalis (83 strains), Streptococcus faecium (131 strains), or Streptococcus bovis (32 strains). Several strains (47 or nearly 15%) either shared characteristics of two species or were completely atypical. S. faecalis and S. bovis were more easily identified than S. faecium, which is not sharply defined from the other species and could be subdivided into several fermentative types on the basis of fermentation of arabinose, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol, and sucrose. The value of some characteristics in species identification is discussed. Growth in the presence of potassium tellurite 1:2,500 and in the presence of 6.5% NaCl and fermentation of arabinose, glycerol, and raffinose are very important tests for the identification of the three species. The reduction of tetrazolium salts, the reduction of litmus milk, and the fermentation of sorbitol may serve as complementary tests for the same purpose. For the differentiation of these three species the "pattern of reactions" is more important than single tests.
TI  - Utilization of sulfur compounds by Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - Prescott, J. M. (A. &. M. College of Texas, College Station). Utilization of sulfur compounds by Streptococcus bovis. J. Bacteriol. 82:724-728. 1961.-Two strains of Streptococcus bovis utilize a variety of compounds as their only source of sulfur, yet exert a definite selectivity in their nutritional requirements for this element. Among sulfur-containing amino acids and related compounds, cystine and cysteine support excellent growth, but cysteic acid and cysteine sulfinic acid do not; methionine is completely inactive as an only sulfur source, but growth is provided by lanthionine, djenkolic acid, allo-cystathionine, homocystine, homocysteine, and glutathione. Several organic sulfur compounds other than amino acids are effective sulfur sources, among which are thioglycolate, thiomalate, thiourea, and thiouracil. In contrast, thiodiglycolate, thiodiglycol, and (phenylthio) acetic acid fail to support growth. Of the inorganic sulfur sources tested, sulfide and thiosulfate are utilized, but sulfite and sulfate are not; it thus appears that the state of oxidation is a critical factor in the utilization of sulfur by these strains of S. bovis. A complex amino acid mixture, without sulfur-containing amino acids, produces more rapid and reproducible growth than either arginine or ammonium acetate when used as a nitrogen source for testing the sulfur compounds. Growth rates are frequently better when the sulfur sources are autoclaved than when they are sterilized by filtration, although the qualitative responses to the compounds are generally similar.
TI  - Nutrition of Streptococcus bovis in relation to dextran formation.
AB  - Barnes, Isabel J. (Cornell University, Ithaca, N. Y.), H. W. Seeley, and P. J. VanDeMark. Nutrition of Streptococcus bovis in relation to dextran formation. J. Bacteriol. 82:85-93. 1961.-Three nutritional types of Streptococcus bovis were encountered. Minimal media for their growth are described. Transferable growth in defined media was always accompanied by dextran production and the nutrition for dextran production could not be distinguished from the minimal nutritional requirements of the organism for growth. Measurable, free CO(2) was evolved from a complex medium during the growth of S. bovis. Several compounds were found to replace partially the CO(2) requirement of the species. When fractured cell preparations containing S. bovis dextran were employed as antigens, rabbits failed to yield sera which would precipitate S. bovis or leuconostoc dextrans.
