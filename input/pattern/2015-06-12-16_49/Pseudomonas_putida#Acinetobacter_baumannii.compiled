TI  - [Oil biodegradation by microbial-plant associations].
AB  - The degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons by plant-microbial associations, as well as the peculiarities of the interaction between microorganisms in consortium and the associated plants, have been studied. It was shown that degrader microorganisms that are part of the consortium Rhodococcus erythropolis S26, Acinetobacter baumannii 1 B, Acinetobacter baumannii 7, and Pseudomonas putida F701 were effective in the degradation of oil and were good colonizers of plant roots (barley). The efficiency of oil degradation increases when microorganisms and plants are used together.
TI  - Proteomic characterization of the outer membrane vesicle of Pseudomonas putida KT2440.
AB  - Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are produced by various pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. In this study, we isolated OMVs from a representative soil bacterium, Pseudomonas putida KT2440, which has a biodegradative activity toward various aromatic compounds. Proteomic analysis identified the outer membrane proteins (OMPs) OprC, OprD, OprE, OprF, OprH, OprG, and OprW as major components of the OMV of P. putida KT2440. The production of OMVs was dependent on the nutrient availability in the culture media, and the up- or down-regulation of specific OMPs was observed according to the culture conditions. In particular, porins (e.g., benzoate-specific porin, BenF-like porin) and enzymes (e.g., catechol 1,2-dioxygenase, benzoate dioxygenase) for benzoate degradation were uniquely found in OMVs prepared from P. putida KT2440 that were cultured in media containing benzoate as the energy source. OMVs of P. putida KT2440 showed low pathological activity toward cultured cells that originated from human lung cells, which suggests their potential as adjuvants or OMV vaccine carriers. Our results suggest that the protein composition of the OMVs of P. putida KT2440 reflects the characteristics of the total proteome of P. putida KT2440.
TI  - [Investigation of the presence of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) by PCR in carbapenem-resistant gram-negative isolates].
AB  - Bacteria producing New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) exhibit high level  resistance to beta-lactams including carbapenems. This broad-spectrum resistance limits treatment options for infections caused by NDM-1 producers. NDM-1 was first isolated from an Indian patient in Sweden; since then, NDM-1 producing isolates have been identified in many countries including Turkey. In this study, we investigated the presence of NDM-1 by PCR method in various gram-negative isolates recovered from clinical specimens in tertiary care hospitals in Samsun, Turkey. A total of 210 carbapenem-resistant gram-negative isolates (132 Acinetobacter baumannii, 54 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 5 Pseudomonas putida, 8 Enterobacter cloacae, 3 Enterobacter aerogenes, 3 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 Providencia rettgeri, 2 Escherichia coli and 1 Citrobacter freundii) were included in the study. Identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of the isolates were performed by using Vitek-2 Compact (bioMerieux, France) and BD Phoenix (BD Diagnostic Systems, MD) automated systems. The results of antibiotic susceptibility testing were interpreted according to the CLSI recommendations. In our study, NDM-1 gene was not detected in any of the clinical isolates by PCR. There was only one case study that reported the presence of NDM-1 in clinical isolates from Turkey [Poirel L et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother 2012;56:2784]. Our data, together with the others, indicated that the existence of NDM-1 in clinical isolates is not common in Turkey. However, since NDM-1 is a plasmid-encoded enzyme, there is always a risk of spread of this resistance through the bacterial strains in our country. Therefore, continuous surveillance and investigation of carbapenem-resistant isolates with resistance patterns suggestive of NDM-1 may enable to identify NDM-1 producing isolates. Meanwhile special care should be given on rational antibiotic use and establishment of appropriate infection control policies to prevent the spread of NDM-1 producers and other potential resistant strains.
TI  - Identification and characterization of an indigo-producing oxygenase involved in  indole 3-acetic acid utilization by Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - Acinetobacter baumannii harbours a gene cluster similar to the iac locus of Pseudomonas putida 1290, which can catabolize the plant hormone indole 3-acetic acid (IAA) as an energy source. However, there has been no evidence showing that IAA can be utilized by A. baumannii. This study showed that A. baumannii can grow in M9 minimal medium containing IAA as the sole carbon source. A mutagenesis study indicated that iacA, encoded in the iac locus of A. baumannii, is involved in the catabolism of IAA. As shown by western blotting analysis, the IacA protein was detected in A. baumannii grown in M9 minimal medium with IAA but not with pyruvate, suggesting that the expression of iacA is regulated by the presence of IAA. In vitro studies have shown that IacA can oxidize indole, an IAA-like molecule, converting it to indoxyl, which spontaneously dimerises to form indigo. In this study, we show that the crude extracts from either wild-type A. baumannii or Escherichia coli overexpressing IacA can oxidize IAA. These results imply that the iac gene cluster of A. baumannii is involved in IAA degradation and that the iacA gene is upregulated when cells encounter IAA in their native environments.
TI  - Development of an immunochromatographic assay for diagnosing the production of IMP-type metallo-beta-lactamases that mediate carbapenem resistance in Pseudomonas.
AB  - Rapid and reliable detection of carbapenem-resistant bacteria is an important infection-control measure and a crucial aspect of antimicrobial chemotherapy. IMP-type metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) is an emzyme that mediate carbapenem resistance in bacteria. Here, an immunochromatographic assay was newly developed using novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recognizing IMP-type MBL. Epitope mapping of mAbs and mutational analysis of the epitope region in IMP antigen suggested that the mAbs could react to all known subtypes of IMP-type MBL. Evaluation of the assay using Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (n=248) showed that the results of the immunochromatographic detection of the IMP-type MBLs were fully consistent with those of the PCR analysis for bla(IMP) genes, showing false positives and negatives. All positive strains were resistant to carbapenem (MIC >/= 16 mug/ml). The assay also accurately distinguished the production of IMP-type MBLs in Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. The detection limit of the assay was 5.7x10(4)cfu per test. Taken together, these data suggest that the developed assay can be used for rapid and reliable diagnosis of the production of IMP-type MBLs in Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Molecular determinants for substrate selectivity of omega-transaminases.
AB  - omega-Transaminase (omega-TA) is an industrially important enzyme for production  of chiral amines. About 20 (S)-specific omega-TAs known to date show remarkably similar substrate selectivity characterized by stringent steric constraint precluding entry of a substituent larger than an ethyl group in the small binding pocket (S) and dual recognition of an aromatic substituent as well as a carboxylate group in the large pocket (L). The strictly defined substrate selectivity of the available omega-TAs remains a limiting factor in the production of structurally diverse chiral amines. In this work, we cloned, purified, and characterized three new omega-TAs from Ochrobactrum anthropi, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Acetobacter pasteurianus that were identified by a BLASTP search using the previously studied omega-TA from Paracoccus denitrificans. All the new omega-TAs exhibited similar substrate specificity, which led us to explore whether the molecular determinants for the substrate specificity are conserved among the omega-TAs. To this end, key active site residues were identified by docking simulation using the X-ray structure of the omega-TA from Pseudomonas putida. We found that the dual recognition in the L pocket is ascribed to Tyr23, Phe88*, and Tyr152 for hydrophobic interaction and Arg414 for recognition of a carboxylate group. In addition, the docking simulation indicates that Trp60 and Ile262 form the S pocket where the substituent size up to an ethyl group turns out to be sterically allowed. The six key residues were found to be essentially conserved among nine omega-TA sequences, underlying the molecular basis for the high similarity in the substrate selectivity.

TI  - Biodiversity of chloramphenicol-resistant mesophilic heterotrophs from Southeast  Asian aquaculture environments.
AB  - In the present study, samples of pond water, sediment and farmed species were collected at 12 fish and shrimp farms in Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam to determine the biodiversity and environmental distribution of chloramphenicol-resistant (CmR) mesophilic heterotrophs in Southeast Asian aquaculture sites. Following isolation on Iso-Sensitest agar supplemented with 35mug ml(-1) Cm and dereplication using (GTG)(5)-PCR fingerprinting, 557 genotypically unique CmR strains were subjected to polyphasic identification. The 557 mesophilic heterotrophic CmR isolates represented 18 different genera largely dominated by the genera Escherichia (40.2%), Pseudomonas (11.7%), Acinetobacter (11.1%), Klebsiella (7.5%) and Bacillus (5.9%). A total of 439 CmR isolates were further assigned to 31 described species or species groups, mainly including organisms that have been associated with various human opportunistic infections such as Escherichia coli (n=219), Pseudomonas putida (n=47), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=38) and Acinetobacter baumannii (n=23). Strains of Escherichia, and most notably, of E. coli, were the only common group of CmR heterotrophs irrespective of country, sample type or farm type. Together with other predominant but less widespread groups such as acinetobacters and pseudomonads, the results of this biodiversity study suggest that E. coli can be regarded as a potential indicator of Cm resistance in Southeast Asian aquaculture environments.
TI  - Biodegradation of 4-chloroaniline by bacteria enriched from soil.
AB  - 4-Chloroaniline has been released into the environment due to extensive use in chemical industries and intensive agriculture; hence, it becomes one of the hazardous pollutants in the priority pollutant list. In this study, three gram-negative bacteria were enriched and isolated from agricultural soil as 4-chloroaniline-degrading bacteria. They were identified as Acinetobacter baumannii CA2, Pseudomonas putida CA16 and Klebsiella sp. CA17. They were able to utilize 4-chloroaniline as a sole carbon and nitrogen source without stimulation or cocultivation with aniline or another cosubstrate. The biodegradation in these bacteria was occurred via a modified ortho-cleavage pathway of which the activity of chlorocatechol 1, 2-dioxygenase was markedly induced. They grew well on 0.2-mM 4-chloroaniline exhibiting a 60-75% degradation efficiency and equimolar liberation of chloride. The isolates were able to survive in the presence of 4-chloroaniline at higher concentrations (up to 1.2 mM). 2-Chloroaniline, 3-chloroaniline and aniline, but not 3, 4-dichloroaniline, were also growth substrates for these isolates. The results of cosubstrate supplementation illustrated the suitable conditions of each isolate to improve growth rate and 4-chloroaniline biodegradation efficiency. These results suggest that these isolates have a potential use for bioremediation of the site contaminated with 4-chloroaniline.
TI  - Evaluation of pyrrolidonyl arylamidase for the identification of nonfermenting Gram-negative rods.
AB  - To evaluate the activity of pyrrolidonyl arylamidase (PYR) for the differentiation and identification of nonfermenting gram negative rods (NFGNR), 293 isolates were tested. A 24 h culture of each test organism was prepared. From this a 108-109 cfu/mL suspension was added to 0.25 mL of sterile physiologic solution. A PYR disk was then added and the test was incubated for 30 minutes at 35-37 degrees C, at environmental atmosphere. Reading was done by adding 1 drop of cinnamaldehyde reagent. Strains of Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter haemolyticus, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bergeyella zoohelcum, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Bordetella hinzii, Brevundimonas diminuta, Brevundimonas vesicularis, Brucella ovis, Brucella spp., Brucella suis, Burkholderia cepacia complex, Moraxella catarrhalis, Moraxella lacunata, Moraxella nonliquefaciens, Moraxella osloensis, Oligella ureolytica, Pseudomonas alcaligenes, Pseudomonas mendocina, Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Pseudomonas Vb3, Psychrobacter phenylpyruvicus, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were PYR negative. On the other hand Achromobacter piechaudii, Achromobacter denitrificans, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Burkholderia gladioli, Chryseobacterium gleum-indologenes, Comamonas testosroni, Cupriavidus pauculus, Delftia acidovorans, Elizabethkingia meningoseptica, Myroides spp., Ochrobactrum anthropi, Pseudomonas oryzihabitans, Ralstonia pickettii, Rhizobium radiobacter, Shewanella spp., Sphingobacterium multivorum, Sphingobacterium spiritivorum, and Weeksella virosa were PYR positive. Finally, Acinetobacter lwoffii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Roseomonas spp., and Sphingomonas paucimobilis-parapaucimobilis were PYR variable. PYR testing should be considered as a useful tool to facilitate the identification of NFGNR.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. Changes in CZOP susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from the breakpoint MIC. Twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Serratia liquefaciens, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter Iwoffii, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Bacteroides fragilis group, and Prevotella/Porphyromonas. CZOP preserved its antibacterial activity against M. (B.) catarrhalis (MIC90: 4 micrograms/mL) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against H. influenzae (MIC90: 1 microgram/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. coli was preferable (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL) and comparable to those of cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), and imipenem (IPM). The MIC90 of CZOP against K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/mL, respectively. The MIC90 of CZOP against E. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. aerogenes was preferable (MIC90: 1 microgram/mL). The antibacterial activities of CZOP against S. marcescens and S. liquefaciens were relatively potent (MIC90: 0.5 and 0.25 microgram/mL) and comparable to those of CPR, CFPM, and carumonam. CZOP preserved comparable antibacterial activity to CPR against C. freundii and C. koseri (MIC90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/mL). The MIC90 of CZOP against P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, and M. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/mL, respectively. The antibacterial activity of CZOP against Providencia spp. was moderate (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against P. aeruginosa was the most potent (MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) among the test agents and comparable to those CFPM, IPM, and MEPM. CZOP had low activity against P. fluorescens and P. putida (MIC90: 128 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against A. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR and CFPM (MIC90: 32 micrograms/mL) and against A. lwoffii was moderate (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). Most of the test agents including CZOP had low antibacterial activity against B. cepacia, S. maltophilia, and B. fragilis group. The MIC90 of CZOP against Prevotella/Porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/mL. Bacterial cross-resistance ratio between CZOP and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. In non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between CZOP and CFPM, CAZ, CPR, or IPM was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. In conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. cloacae possible decreased, but against other Gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.
TI  - Attachment to and biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces by Acinetobacter baumannii: involvement of a novel chaperone-usher pili assembly system.
AB  - Acinetobacter baumannii causes severe infections in compromised patients, survives on abiotic surfaces in hospital environments and colonizes different medical devices. In this study the analysis of the processes involved in surface attachment and biofilm formation by the prototype strain 19606 was initiated. This strain attaches to and forms biofilm structures on plastic and glass surfaces, particularly at the liquid-air interface of cultures incubated stagnantly. The cell aggregates, which contain cell stacks separated by water channels, formed under different culture conditions and were significantly enhanced under iron limitation. Electron and fluorescence microscopy showed that pili and exopolysaccharides are part of the cell aggregates formed by this strain. Electron microscopy of two insertion derivatives deficient in attachment and biofilm formation revealed the disappearance of pili-like structures and DNA sequencing analysis showed that the transposon insertions interrupted genes with the highest similarity to hypothetical genes found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Although the products of these genes, which have been named csuC and csuE, have no known functions, they are located within a polycistronic operon that includes four other genes, two of which encode proteins related to chaperones and ushers involved in pili assembly in other bacteria. Introduction of a copy of the csuE parental gene restored the adherence phenotype and the presence of pili on the cell surface of the csuE mutant, but not that of the csuC derivative. These results demonstrate that the expression of a chaperone-usher secretion system, some of whose components appear to be acquired from unrelated sources, is required for pili formation and the concomitant attachment to plastic surfaces and the ensuing formation of biofilms by A. baumannii cells.
TI  - PCR typing of genetic determinants for metallo-beta-lactamases and integrases carried by gram-negative bacteria isolated in Japan, with focus on the class 3 integron.
AB  - From January 2001 to December 2002, 587 strains of gram-negative bacterial isolates demonstrating resistance to ceftazidime and a combination of sulbactam and cefoperazone were subjected to a disk diffusion screening test using sodium mercaptoacetic acid; 431 strains (73.4%) appeared to produce metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL). Of these 431 strains, 357 were found by PCR to carry genes for IMP-1 type MBL (bla(IMP-1)), while only 7 and 67 strains carried the IMP-2 gene (bla(IMP-2)) and the VIM-2 gene (bla(VIM-2)), respectively. Neither VIM-1 nor SPM-1 type MBL genes were found among the strains tested. Of 431 strains, 427 carried the intI1 gene, and 4 strains carrying both the intI1 and intI3 genes were reidentified as Pseudomonas putida harboring bla(IMP-1). Of these four P. putida strains, three strains and one strain, respectively, were separately isolated from two hospitals located in the same prefecture, and the three strains showed very similar pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns. Of 357 bla(IMP-1) carriers, 116, 53, 51, 47, and 30 strains were identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Alcaligenes xylosoxidans, P. putida/fluorescens, Serratia marcescens, and Acinetobacter baumannii, respectively. Four strains carrying bla(IMP-2) were reidentified as P. putida. Sixty-three P. aeruginosa strains and four P. putida strains carried bla(VIM-2). Of 427 intI1-positive strains, 180, 53, 51, 47, and 35 were identified as P. aeruginosa, A. xylosoxidans, P. putida/fluorescens, S. marcescens, and A. baumannii, respectively. In the present study, it was confirmed that strains carrying bla(IMP-1) with a class 1 integron are the most prevalent type in Japan, although several intI3 carriers have also been identified sporadically in this country.
TI  - Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of clinical isolates of nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria by the Phoenix Automated Microbiology System.
AB  - The Phoenix Automated Microbiology System (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD) was evaluated for its ability to identify nonfermenting gram-negative pathogens and measure their drug susceptibility. Isolates producing rare extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (PER-1, IMP-2, VIM-1, and VIM-2) were included in the study. Species identification was compared to that given by the ATB System (bio-Merieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), whereas susceptibility results were compared to those produced by a reference broth microdilution test (panels manufactured by Pasco Laboratories, Becton Dickinson). The Phoenix system consistently identified all isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 55) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 28), while in other cases species agreement was obtained for 47/53 isolates (Acinetobacter baumannii, 29/31; Pseudomonas putida, 10/11; Burkholderia cepacia, 6/7; and Pseudomonas fluorescens, 2/4). Overall, the Phoenix and ATB systems gave equal results in 130/136 cases (95.6%). For two isolates, consistent identification was obtained at the genus level, thus bringing the cumulative agreement to 97.1%. MIC values (interpreted according to NCCLS guidelines) gave essential and categorical agreement in 94.2% and 93.1% of cases, respectively. Minor and major errors were 5.1% and 5.2%, respectively. No very major errors were produced. The mean time to results (TTR) for the Phoenix system was 14.8 +/- 1.6 h (mean +/- SD), with the shortest TTR being observedfor A. baumannii (13.0 +/- 1.8 h) and the longest one for P. aeruginosa (15.6 +/- 1.2 h). In conclusion, the Phoenix system performed rapidly and correctly in the identification of clinical isolates of important opportunistic pathogens and in measuring their susceptibility to antipseudomonal drugs.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. Changes in CZOP susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with the breakpoint MIC. Twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), Escherichia coli (n = 276), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 93), Serratia marcescens (n = 172), Serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), Citrobacter freundii (n = 177), Citrobacter koseri (n = 70), Proteus mirabilis (n = 113), Proteus vulgaris (n = 89), Morganella morganii (n = 116), Providencia spp. (n = 41), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), Pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), Pseudomonas putida (n = 63), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), Acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), Burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and Prevotella/Porphyromonas (n = 173). An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, and S. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. MIC90 of CZOP against M.(B.) catarrhalis, C. koseri, and P. aeruginosa was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. MIC90 of CZOP against E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, and P. mirabilis increased year by year. The increase in MIC90 of CZOP against E. aerogenes and P. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. In contract, the susceptibility of E. cloacae to CZOP was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to CZOP. MIC90 of CZOP against C. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. Additionally, MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against P. fluorescens, P. putida, B. cepacia, S. maltophilia, B. fragilis group, and Prevotella/Porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. Changes in MIC90 of CZOP against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.
TI  - [Non fermentative gram negative bacilli isolated in a hospital laboratory].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report a prospective study on non fermentative gramnegative bacilli, excluded Pseudomonas aeruginosa, isolated at Dr. Julio C. Perrando Hospital in Resistencia (Argentina). The goal of this study was to know their frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility. MATERIAL AND METHODS: For bacterial identifications we used biochemical tests. RESULTS: The greatest percentages of non fermentative gramnegative bacilli isolates were found in blood samples (25%), respiratory secretions and urine (23.9%). Acinetobacter baumannii (34.7%), Pseudomonas fluorescens/Pseudomonas putida (15.2%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (9.7%) and Burkholderia cepacia (8.7%) were the non fermentative gramnegative bacilli species most commonly isolated. Distribution of microorganism strains according to samples and area is also assessed. Antimicrobial sensitivity of most commonly isolated non fermentative gramnegative bacilli strain analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that non fermentative gramnegative bacilli are most frequently present in hospitalized that in outpatients and antibacterial therapy must be provided according to bacteriological information.
TI  - [Occurrence of gram-negative non-fermenting rods in hemocultures and their sensitivity to antimicrobial agents].
AB  - In the period from January 1993 to June 1996 were at the Department of Microbiology of the University Hospital in Olomouc 122 strains of Gram-negative nonfermentative rod-shaped bacteria isolated from haemocultures. The majority represented the group of 51 strains of the genus Acinetobacter (41.8%), complex A. calcoaceticus-baumannii (Acb complex). The second largest group were 21 strains (17.2%) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These were followed by 17 strains (13.9%) of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, 8 strains (6.6%) of non-Acb complex acinetobacters, 6 strains (4.9%) of Pseudomonas putida and 5 strains (4.1%) of Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. The remaining species were represented only by 1-2 strains. In three isolations was the identification impossible. The majority of strains (24.6%) were from the Department of Haematology of the University Hospital in Olomouc. The most frequent diagnoses in patients with positive haemocultures were leukemias and lymphomas (24.6%). The most effective tested antimicrobial agents were ceftazidime (93.4% of sensitive strains) and ofloxacin (91.7%). From the total number of 80 strains detected using the equipment BacT/Alert 120, 22 (27.5%) were isolated repeatedly confirming their role in the etiology of bacteriemic or septic episodes. Because only one blood sample was obtained in 34 cases (58.6%) of the remaining 58 only once detected strains, it was impossible to confirm their etiologic role by repeated isolation. (Tab. 6, Ref. 22.)
TI  - [Evaluation of antibacterial activities of various antibiotics against glucose non-fermentative gram-negative rods other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa].
AB  - MICs of piperacillin, sulbactam/cefoperazone, minocycline (MINO), gentamicin, amikacin, flomoxef, ceftazidime, cefozopran, cefsulodin and imipenem were determined, against 189 clinical isolated strains of glucose non-fermentative Gram-negative Rods (NFGNR; Acinetobacter baumannii (44), Alcaligenes faecalis (5), Alcaligenes xylosoxidans (25), Burkholderia cepacia (12), Chryseobacterium indologenes (23), Chryseobacterium meningosepticum (9), Pseudomonas fluorescens (8), Pseudomonas putida (12), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (51). Most species of these NFGNR show resistance to many antibiotics tested. Among the antibiotics used in this study, the only antibiotic effective against all species of NFGNR tested is MINO. The spectrums of antibacterial activities of various antibiotics determined by MICs may be useful in preliminary test for identification of these NFGNR.
TI  - In vitro activities of quinolones, beta-lactams, tobramycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - From 1991 to 1995, 8,975 nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli were isolated from patients at The Ohio State University Medical Center: 71% Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 14% Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, 7.6% Acinetobacter baumannii, and < 2% each of 25 other species. The MICs of trovafloxacin (CP-99,219), ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, cefoperazone, ceftriaxone, imipenem, tobramycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) were determined for 308 isolates, representing 13 species, by a standardized broth microdilution method. The activities of all drugs were species dependent. The fluoroquinolones had inconsistent activity against most species, although several relatively uncommon nonfermenters were consistently susceptible or resistant. Trovafloxacin was considerably more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against S. maltophilia, A. baumannii, and several less common species. Among the beta-lactams, relative activities varied considerably; overall, imipenem had the broadest spectrum of activity but was inactive against S. maltophilia and Burkholderia cepacia isolates. Tobramycin and TMP-SMZ had stereotypic spectra of activity. Tobramycin was active against most species except S. maltophilia, Alcaligenes xylosoxidans subsp. xylosoxidans, Burkholderia spp., and Weeksella virosa. TMP-SMZ was active against most species except P. aeruginosa and Pseudomonas fluorescens-putida. A review of laboratory records indicated few changes in susceptibility patterns from 1991 to 1995; the only clear trend was toward increasing P. aeruginosa resistance to all classes of drugs.
TI  - [Frequency of clinical isolation of glucose non-fermentative gram-negative rods and their susceptibilities to antibacterial agents].
AB  - A comparison was made for frequencies of isolation o glucose non-fermentative Gram-negative rods ((G)NF-GNR) from clinical specimens during a period from July, 1986 to June, 1987 (the first period) and that from January, 1994 to December, 1994 (the second period). Also, minimum inhibitory concentrations of principal drugs were determined against these isolates. The obtained results are summarized as follows: 1. Thirty four (34) species of (G)NF-GNR were found from 35,200 clinical specimens in the two periods. Numbers of strains of (G)NF-GNR obtained were 4,575 during the first period and 4,704 during the second period, thus no significant difference existed in numbers of strains isolated in the two periods. 2. Among the 34 species to which the 4,704 strains were classified into, Pseudomonas aeruginosa comprised 68.4%, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia 6.9%, Acinetobacter baumannii 5.6%, Burkholderia cepacia 3.1%, Acinetobacter Iwoffii 2.6%, Alcaligenes xylosoxidans subsp. xylosoxidans 2.4%, Flavobacterium indologenes 1.7%, Pseudomonas putida 1.1%, Acinetobacter junii 1.1% and Moraxella subgenus Moraxella lacunata 0.9%. When these frequencies of isolation were compared with those in the first period, it was found that B. cepacia decreased significantly (P < 0.01) and that S. maltophilia increased significantly (P < 0.001). 3. MIC determinations revealed multiple drug resistance strains in many different species of bacteria. Minocycline, however, were active against many such strains, and ofloxacin was found to have strong antibacterial activity against some strains.
