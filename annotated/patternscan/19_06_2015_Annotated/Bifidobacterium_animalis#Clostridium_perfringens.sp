TI  == in vitro inhibition of clostridium difficile and clostridium perfringens by commercial probiotic strains.
AB  == probiotics have gained importance in human and veterinary medicine to prevent and control clostridial enteric disease. limited information is available on the ability of different probiotic bacteria used in food products to inhibit clostridium difficile and clostridium perfringens. the objective of this study was to examine the in vitro inhibitory effects of selected commercial bacterial strains on pathogenic clostridia and their growth characteristics under simulated gastrointestinal conditions. the inhibitory effects of 17 commercial strains of lactobacillus (n = 16) and bifidobacterium (n = 1) on the reference strains of c. difficile and c. perfringens were assessed by an agar well diffusion assay and by a broth culture inhibition assay using cell-free supernatant harvested at different growth phases, with and without ph neutralization. to study growth characteristics, probiotic strains were cultivated in different acid and bile environments, and growth in the modified media was compared to growth in standard medium. in the agar well diffusion assay, supernatant obtained from two probiotic strains inhibited the growth of both reference and clinical strains of c. perfringens. this effect as seen when supernatant was assessed with and without ph neutralization. supernatants obtained from 10 probiotic strains inhibited c. difficile only when supernatant was added without ph neutralization. in the broth culture inhibition assay, growth of c. perfringens and c. difficile was inhibited by supernatant without ph neutralization from 5 and 10 probiotic strains, respectively. all potential probiotic strains were able to grow at ph 4.0 and in  the presence of 0.15% and 0.3% bile but none were able to grow or survive at ph 2.0. altogether five probiotic strains [lactobacillus plantarum (n = 2), lactobacillus rhamnosus (n = 2), bifidobacterium animalis lactis (n = 1)] were shown to inhibit all strains of c. difficile and c. perfringens. the inhibitory effect was probiotic strain-specific. two strains showed a ph-independent inhibitory effect likely due to production of either antibiotics or bacteriocins  inhibiting c. perfringens only. these strains have favourable growth characteristics for use as probiotics and their efficacy as prophylactic or therapeutic measures against clostridial enteric disease should be further evaluated by clinical trials in animals.

TI  == the effect of selected synbiotics on microbial composition and short-chain fatty  acid production in a model system of the human colon.
AB  == background: prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics can be used to modulate both the composition and activity of the gut microbiota and thereby potentially affecting host health beneficially. the aim of this study was to investigate the  effects of eight synbiotic combinations on the composition and activity of human  fecal microbiota using a four-stage semicontinuous model system of the human colon. methods and findings: carbohydrates were selected by their ability to enhance growth of the probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm (ncfm) and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bl-04 (bl-04) under laboratory conditions. the most effective carbohydrates for each probiotic were further investigated, using the colonic model, for the ability to support growth of the probiotic bacteria, influence the composition of the microbiota and stimulate formation of short-chain fatty acids (scfa).the following combinations were studied: ncfm with isomaltulose, cellobiose, raffinose and an oat beta-glucan hydrolysate (obgh) and bl-04 with melibiose, xylobiose, raffinose and maltotriose. all carbohydrates showed capable of increasing levels of ncfm and bl-04 during fermentations in the colonic model by 10(3)-10(4) fold and 10-10(2)  fold, respectively. also the synbiotic combinations decreased the modified ratio  of bacteroidetes/firmicutes (calculated using qpcr results for bacteroides-prevotella-porphyromonas group, clostridium perfringens cluster i, clostridium coccoides - eubacterium rectale group and clostridial cluster xiv) as well as significantly increasing scfa levels, especially acetic and butyric acid, by three to eight fold, as compared to the controls. the decreases in the modified ratio of bacteroidetes/firmicutes were found to be correlated to increases in acetic and butyric acid (p=0.04 and p=0.03, respectively). conclusions: the results of this study show that all synbiotic combinations investigated are able to shift the predominant bacteria and the production of scfa of fecal microbiota in a model system of the human colon, thereby potentially being able to manipulate the microbiota in a way connected to human health.

TI  == the effect of probiotics on faecal microbiota and genotoxic activity of faecal water in patients with atopic dermatitis: a randomized, placebo-controlled study.
AB  == background: colonic microbiota is involved in the etiology of colon cancer according to several reports. studies also indicate that the microbiota differs between atopic patients and healthy subjects. objective: to evaluate whether a probiotic mix containing lactobacillus paracasei lpc-37, lactobacillus acidophilus 74-2, and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis dgcc 420 can affect  the microbiota and its genotoxic activity in healthy subjects and patients with atopic dermatitis (ad). methods: a placebo-controlled cross-over study was conducted. fifteen healthy adults and 15 adult ad patients consumed 2x100 ml/d of either a probiotic or a placebo drink for 8 weeks followed by a wash out period of 2 weeks before crossing the intervention. faecal water was isolated from stool samples collected at the end of each period. ht29c19a cells incubated with faecal water were measured for dna damage using single-cell gel electrophoresis ("comet  assay"). bacterial species were determined by qpcr and concentrations of short-chain fatty acids were measured by means of gas chromatography. results: probiotic supplementation resulted in a significant increase in lactobacilli, whereas numbers of bifidobacteria and bacteroidetes remained unchanged. clostridium perfringens cluster i-ii was significantly reduced in healthy subjects. genotoxic potential (expressed as tail intensity) of faecal water, was  not affected. however, tail intensity decreased significantly in the probiotic period compared to placebo (23.5 vs. 16.7%) in ad patients. although faecal concentrations of short-chain fatty acids were not affected, faecal ph was significantly reduced (7.0 vs. 6.6) in ad patients after probiotics. conclusion:  the results indicate that probiotics lower the genotoxic potential of faecal water in ad patients. the faecal c. perfringens cluster i-ii levels remained unaffected suggesting either a change in their activity, or the fact that other bacterial species are responsible for the reduced genotoxic activity of faecal water.

TI  == early administration of probiotics alters bacterial colonization and limits diet-induced gut dysfunction and severity of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm pigs.
AB  == following preterm birth, bacterial colonization and enteral formula feeding predispose neonates to gut dysfunction and necrotizing enterocolitis (nec), a serious gastrointestinal inflammatory disease. we hypothesized that administration of probiotics would beneficially influence early bacterial colonization, thereby reducing the susceptibility to formula-induced gut atrophy, dysfunction, and nec. caesarean-delivered preterm pigs were provided total parenteral nutrition (1.5 d) followed by enteral feeding (2 d) with porcine colostrum (colos; n = 5), formula (form; n = 9), or formula with probiotics (form-p; bifidobacterium animalis and lactobacillus: l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. pentosus, l. plantarum; n = 13). clinical nec scores were reduced (p < 0.05) in form-p (2.0 +/- 0.2) and colos groups (1.7 +/- 0.5) compared with form pigs (3.4  +/- 0.6). lower nec scores were associated with elevated intestinal weight, mucosa proportion, villus height, rna integrity, and brush border aminopeptidase  a and n activities, and lower gastric organic acid concentration in the form-p and colos groups (p < 0.05). diversity of the mucosa-associated bacteria in the distal small intestine was similar among formula-fed pigs, yet the abundance of specific bacterial groups differed between form-p and form pigs. form-p pigs had  lower colonization density of a potential pathogen, clostridium perfringens, and  had commensal lactobacillus bacteria more closely associated with enterocytes along the villus-crypt axis relative to form pigs. these results suggest that probiotic administration immediately after birth promotes the colonization of a beneficial commensal microbiota capable of limiting the formula-induced mucosal atrophy, dysfunction, and pathogen load in preterm neonates, thereby reducing the incidence and severity of nec.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.
