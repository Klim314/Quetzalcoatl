TI  == antimicrobial activity of schinus lentiscifolius (anacardiaceae).
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: schinus lentiscifolius marchand (syn. schinus weinmannifolius engl) is a plant native to rio grande do sul (southern brazil) and has been used in brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. material and methods: the crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, three gram negative bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: candida albicans, candida tropicalis, cryptococcus neoformans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two gram positive bacteria, namely, bacillus cereus, enterococcus spp, and six gram negative bacteria, namely, burkholderia cepacia, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis. results: the leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of schinus lentiscifolius showed a  broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (mic) against the tested bacteria and fungi. the n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against candida albicans (mic=25 mug/ml), candida tropicalis (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and cryptococcus neoformans, (mic=15.5 mug/ml). from the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of schinus lentiscifolius. conclusion: the antimicrobial activity and some constituents of schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. the results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.

TI  == antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity of selected egyptian medicinal plants.
AB  == medicinal plants have been used as a source of remedies since ancient times in egypt. the present study was designed to investigate the antibacterial activity and the cytotoxicity of the organic extracts from 16 selected medicinal plants of egypt. the study was also extended to the isolation of the antiproliferative compound jaeschkeanadiol p-hydroxybenzoate (fh-25) from ferula hermonis. the microbroth dilution was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of the samples against twelve bacterial strains belonging to four species,  providencia stuartii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli, while a resazurin assay was used to assess the cytotoxicity of  the extracts on the human pancreatic cancer cell line miapaca-2, breast cancer cell line mcf-7, ccrf-cem leukemia cells, and their multidrug resistant subline,  cem/adr5000. the results of the mic determination indicated that all the studied  crude extracts were able to inhibit the growth of at least one of the tested bacterial species, the best activity being recorded with the crude extracts from  f. hermonis and vitis vinifera, whichwere active against 91.7% and 83.3% of the studied bacteria, respectively. the lowest mic value of 128 mug/ml was recorded against p. stuartii atcc 29916 and e. coli atcc 10536 with the extract from v. vinifera and commiphora molmol, respectively. in the cytotoxicity study, ic50 values below 20 mug/ml were recorded for the crude extract of f. hermonis on all  four studied cancer cell lines. fh-25 also showed good cytotoxicity against mcf-7 cells (ic50: 2.47 mug/ml). finally, the results of the present investigation provided supportive data for the possible use of the plant extracts investigated  herein, mostly f. hermonis and v. vinifera in the treatment of bacterial infections and jaeschkeanadiol p-hydroxybenzoate in the control of cancer diseases.

TI  == crystalline bacterial biofilm formation on urinary catheters by urease-producing  urinary tract pathogens: a simple method of control.
AB  == the problem of catheter encrustation stems from infection by urease-producing bacteria. these organisms generate ammonia from urea, elevate the ph of urine and cause crystals of calcium and magnesium phosphates to form in the urine and the biofilm that develops on the catheter. in this study, a laboratory model was used to compare the ability of 12 urease-positive species of urinary tract pathogens to encrust and block catheters. proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and providencia rettgeri were able to raise the urinary ph above 8.3 and produce catheter-blocking crystalline biofilms within 40 h. morganella morganii and staphylococcus aureus elevated the ph of urine to 7.4 and 6.9, respectively, and  caused some crystal deposition in the biofilms but did not block catheters in the 96 h experimental period. isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and providencia stuartii were only capable of raising the ph of urine to a maximum of 6.4 and failed to cause crystal deposition in the biofilm. the most effective way to prevent catheter encrustation was shown to be diluting urine and increasing its citrate concentration. this strategy raises the nucleation ph (ph(n)) at which calcium and magnesium phosphates crystallize from urine. increasing the fluid intake of a healthy volunteer with citrated drinks resulted in urine with a ph(n) of >8.0 in which catheter encrustation was inhibited. it is suggested that this dietary strategy will be an effective means of controlling catheter encrustation, whichever bacterial species is causing the problem.

TI  == c-3 substituted lawsonemonoximates of holmium(iii): synthesis, characterization,  and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == a series of five new metal complexes of ho(iii) with c-3 substituted derivatives  of lawsonemonexime (2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthalenediene-1-oxime) were synthesized. the compounds were characterized by melting point, elemental analysis, ir spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility. the antimicrobial activity of the compounds were determined by disk diffusion method and broth micro-dilution techniques using mueller hinton medium against the following organisms: s. aureus atcc 6538p, klebsiella pneumoniae, nctc 418, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27833, salmonella typhimurium atcc 23564, e. coli u 1777, e. coli hb101, proteus morganii ncim 2860, providencia stuartii ncim 2799 and acinetobacter baumannii u  24. the chelates of ho(iii) with lawsonemonoxime and ho(iii) with 3-bromolawsonemonoxime showed a variable antimicrobial activity against all organisms tested except pseudomonas and klebsiella spp. s. aureus was found more  sensitive to all ligands and chelates tested; but the mic values of chelates were considerably less; thus having more antimicrobial effect.

TI  == evaluation of different laboratory tests for the detection of metallo-beta-lactamase production in enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == objectives: clinical isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae (91), escherichia coli (49), enterobacter spp. (27), proteus mirabilis (17), citrobacter freundii (2), providencia stuartii (3) and serratia spp. (5), with various mics of imipenem, were examined for production of metallo-beta-lactamases (mbls) with different phenotypic laboratory tests that have been previously published to detect mbls in pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. methods: a total of 194 (95 mbl-positive and 99 mbl-negative) clinical isolates with imipenem mics < or = 0.25 to > 256 mg/l were examined. all isolates were evaluated by the double-disc  synergy test (ddst), the combination disc test (cdt), the mbl etest and the modified hodge test. the presence of bla(vim) and bla(imp) genes was evaluated by in situ hybridization with specific probes and was certified by pcr. results: in  30 bla(vim)-positive isolates that exhibited mics of imipenem < or = 4 mg/l, mbl  etest could not be evaluated. cdt with ceftazidime and 1900 or 750 microg of edta, and ddst after applying an imipenem disc 10 mm apart from a disc containing approximately 1900 microg of edta, showed the highest sensitivity (97.9% to 100%) and specificity (87.9% to 96%) rates among the analysed procedures. cdt with imipenem and 1900 microg of edta exhibited a sensitivity of 94.7% and showed very good specificity (98%). conclusions: the cdt with imipenem/imipenem+0.5 m edta or ceftazidime/ceftazidime+0.2 m edta and the ddst with imipenem 10 mm apart from edta are the most effective methods for the detection of mbls in enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == species interactions in mixed-community crystalline biofilms on urinary catheters.
AB  == previous experimental investigations of the crystalline biofilms that colonize and block urinary catheters have focussed on their formation by pure cultures of  proteus mirabilis. in the urine of patients undergoing long-term catheterization, p. mirabilis is commonly found in mixed communities with other urinary tract pathogens. little is known about the effect that the other species have on the rate at which p. mirabilis encrusts catheters. in the present study, a set of data on the nature of the bacterial communities on 106 catheter biofilms has been analysed and it was found that while species such as providencia stuartii and klebsiella pneumoniae were commonly associated with p. mirabilis, when escherichia coli, morganella morganii or enterobacter cloacae were present, p. mirabilis was rarely or never found. the hypothesis that the absence of p. mirabilis from some biofilm communities could be due to its active exclusion by other species has also been examined. experiments in laboratory models showed that co-infection of p. mirabilis with m. morganii, k. pneumoniae or e. coli had  no effect on the ability of p. mirabilis to encrust and block catheters. co-infection with ent. cloacae or pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, significantly  increased the time that catheters took to block (p <0.05). the growth of ent. cloacae, m. morganii, k. pneumoniae or e. coli in the model for 72 h prior to superinfection with p. mirabilis significantly delayed catheter blockage. in the  case of ent. cloacae, for example, the mean time to blockage was extended from 28.7 h to 60.7 h (p < or =0.01). in all cases, however, p. mirabilis was able to  generate alkaline urine, colonize the biofilms, induce crystal formation and block the catheters. the results suggest that although there is a degree of antagonism between p. mirabilis and some of the other urinary tract organisms, the effects are temporary and whatever the pre-existing urinary microbiota, infection with p. mirabilis is thus likely to lead to catheter encrustation and blockage.

TI  == effect of triclosan on the development of bacterial biofilms by urinary tract pathogens on urinary catheters.
AB  == objectives: to examine (i) the effect of triclosan on the formation of catheter biofilms by urinary tract pathogens and (ii) the diffusion of triclosan through the retention balloons of urinary catheters. methods: models of the catheterized  bladder were infected with eight different urinary tract pathogens and the effect of triclosan on biofilm formation was assessed by determining the numbers of viable cells colonizing the catheters and by scanning electron microscopy. hplc was used to determine the triclosan concentration in urine draining from models that had been fitted with triclosan-inflated silicone catheters. results: when catheters were inflated with triclosan (10 g/l) the formation of catheter biofilm by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis was prevented. the numbers of enterococcus faecalis and providencia stuartii cells colonizing catheters were also significantly reduced (p<0.05). serratia marcescens, morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, were able to produce extensive catheter biofilms in the presence of triclosan. only p. mirabilis produced alkaline urine and encrusted the catheters. concentrations of 0.02-0.16 mg/l of the biocide were detected in urine draining from the model over the 48 h experimental period. conclusions: triclosan diffused through silicone catheter balloons and produced urinary concentrations that prevented catheter encrustation by p. mirabilis and biofilm formation by several  other common pathogens of the catheterized urinary tract. it had little effect on urease-producing p. aeruginosa, s. marcescens or m. morganii but these species did not produce alkaline urine or crystalline biofilms.

TI  == genetic environment and expression of the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase blaper-1 gene in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the genetic location of the gene coding for the expanded-spectrum beta-lactamase  per-1 was analyzed in a series of gram-negative isolates. it was identified as part of a composite transposon bracketed by two novel insertion elements, ispa12  and ispa13, belonging to the is4 family that possess transposases that share 63%  amino acid identity and that are chromosomally located in pseudomonas aeruginosa, providencia stuartii, and acinetobacter baumannii. on the contrary, the bla(per-1) gene was identified just downstream of an ispa12 element but not within a composite transposon when it was located on a plasmid in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and a. baumannii isolates. in both cases, expression of the bla(per-1) gene was driven by promoter sequences located in ispa12.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == susceptibility of antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria to biocides: a perspective from the study of catheter biofilms.
AB  == bacteria resistant to both the agents deployed to prevent infections and those used to treat infections would be formidable nosocomial pathogens. the aim of this paper is to review the evidence that gram-negative bacteria resistant to antibiotics and biocides have emerged and been responsible for catheter-associated urinary tract infection. a study of patients undergoing intermittent bladder catheterization revealed that the frequent application of the antiseptic chlorhexidine to the perineal skin prior to the insertion of the catheter was effective against the normal gram-positive skin flora but not against the gram-negative organisms that subsequently colonized this site. organisms such as providencia stuartii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis were repeatedly isolated from the skin of these patients and inevitably went on to cause urinary infections. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of chlorhexidine for many of these strains proved to be 200-800 microg ml(-1) compared with the 10-50 microg ml(-1) recorded for reference strains of gram-negative species. a subsequent survey of over 800 gram-negative isolates from urinary tract infections in patients from both hospitals and the community revealed that chlorhexidine resistance was not a widespread phenomenon, but was restricted to these species and to units where the care of catheterized patients  involved the extensive use of chlorhexidine. analysis of the antibiotic resistance patterns revealed that the chlorhexidine-resistant strains were also multidrug resistant. other clinical studies also reported catheter-associated infections with chlorhexidine- and multidrug-resistant strains of pr. mirabilis when chlorhexidine was being used extensively. this species poses particular problems to the catheterized patient. chlorhexidine thus proved counterproductive in the care of catheters and its use in this context has been largely abandoned.  suggestions of reintroducing this agent in the form of biocide-impregnated catheters should be resisted.

TI  == resistant pathogens in urinary tract infections.
AB  == antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria causing urinary tract infection (uti) has evolved over several decades as antimicrobial exposure has repeatedly been followed by emergence of resistance. older populations in the community, long-term care facilities, or acute care facilities have an increased prevalence  of resistant bacteria isolated from uti. resistant isolates are more frequent in  long-term care populations than the community. resistant isolates include common  uropathogens, such as escherichia coli or proteus mirabilis, and organisms with higher levels of intrinsic resistance, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa or providencia stuartii. isolation of resistant organisms is consistently associated with prior antimicrobial exposure and higher functional impairment. the increased likelihood of resistant bacteria makes it essential that a urine specimen for culture and susceptibility testing be obtained before instituting antimicrobial therapy. therapy for the individual patient must be balanced with the possibility that antimicrobial use will promote further resistance. antimicrobial therapy should be avoided unless there is a clear clinical indication. in particular, asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated with antimicrobials. where symptoms are mild or equivocal, urine culture results should be obtained before initiating therapy. this permits selection of specific therapy for the infecting  organism and avoids empiric, usually broad-spectrum, therapy. where empirical therapy is necessary, prior infecting organisms should be isolated, and recent antimicrobial therapy, as well as regional or facility susceptibility patterns, should be considered in antimicrobial choice. where empirical therapy is used, it should be reassessed 48 to 72 hours after initiation, once pretherapy cultures are available.

TI  == isolation and identification of bacteria associated with adult laboratory mexican fruit flies, anastrepha ludens (diptera: tephritidae).
AB  == from the guts of new and old colonies (female and male) of mexican fruit flies, anastrepha ludens (diptera: tephritidae), we identified a total of 18 different bacterial species belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonadaceae, vibrionaceae, micrococcaceae, deinococcacea, bacillaceae, and the genus listeria. enterobacter, providencia, serratia, and staphylococcus spp. were the most frequently isolated genera, with citrobacter, streptococcus, aerococcus, and listeria found less frequently. we found bacillus cereus, enterobacter sakazakii, providencia stuartii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa only in the new colony, aeromonas hydrophila and klebsiella pneumoniae spp. pneumoniae only in the old colony. we also studied resistance/sensitivity to 12 antibiotics for six bacterial isolates such as enterobacter cloacae, e. sakazakii, k. pneumoniae spp., providencia rettgeri, p. aeruginosa, and bacillus cereus. isolates on the whole were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin (five of six isolates) and sensitive to rifampin and streptomycin (six of six isolates). antibiotic resistance profiles might be useful characteristics for distinguishing among species and strains of these bacteria, probably having ecological significance with respect to intra- and inter-specific competition within host cadavers, and could have implications for the utility of these organisms for biological control, including the alternative control strategy, paratransgenesis.

TI  == men 10700, a new penem antibiotic: in-vitro activity and its correlation with beta-lactamase stability, pbp affinity and diffusion through the bacterial cell wall.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of men 10700, a novel penem, was compared with that of imipenem, ritipenem, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin and amikacin against 1088 strains taken from 21 genera, including gram-negative, gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria. mic data showed that men 10700 was very active against staphylococci and streptococci (mic90 < or = 0.5 mg/l) and against most members of the enterobacteriaceae (mic90 < or = 2 mg/l), with reduced activity only against providencia stuartii (mic90 = 8 mg/l). men 10700 was also active against  anaerobic species such as clostridium perfringens and bacteroides fragilis as well as moraxella catarrhalis. it was moderately active against enterococcus faecalis and inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, aeromonas spp. and acinetobacter spp. its antibacterial spectrum was thus slightly narrower than that of imipenem, but compared favourably with those  of a third-generation cephalosporin and ritipenem. men 10700 was highly stable to a number of beta-lactamases and was a poor inducer of class i enzymes. it bound penicillin-binding protein 2 with the highest affinity and easily permeated the outer membrane of escherichia coli.

AB  == gv129606 is a new parenteral trinem antibiotic belonging to the beta-lactam class. it combines broad-spectrum activity (against gram-negative and -positive bacteria, aerobes and anaerobes), with high potency and resistance to beta-lactamases. comparative in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities were determined for gv129606 against more than 400 recent clinical isolates (aerobes,  including beta-lactamase producers, and anaerobes), using representative antibacterial agents (meropenem, piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin for aerobes and metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin, and clindamycin for anaerobes). against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and streptococci, gv129606 and meropenem were the most active of the drugs tested. gv129606 showed an mic for 90% of strains tested (mic90) ranging from < or =0.015 to 0.06 microg/ml against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae. against penicillin-susceptible and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, gv129606, meropenem, and cefpirome showed mic90s of < or =0.015 and 1 microg/ml, respectively. meropenem was the most active compound against members of the family enterobacteriaceae with mic90s of < or =0.5 microg/ml. against these species, gv129606 possessed activity superior to those of piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, and gentamicin, with mic90s of < or =8 microg/ml, but its activity was two- to sixfold less than that of ciprofloxacin (with the exception of proteus rettgeri and providencia stuartii).  haemophilus spp., moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also included in the spectrum of gv129606. gv129606 showed good antianaerobe activity, similar to metronidazole. it was stable against all clinically relevant beta-lactamases (similar to meropenem). the in vitro activity was confirmed in vivo against septicemia infections induced in mice by selected gram-positive and -negative bacteria with 50% effective doses (ed50s) of < or =0.05 and < or =0.5 mg/kg of body weight/dose, respectively. gv129606 was as effective as meropenem against septicemia in mice caused by ceftazidime-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, exhibiting an ed50 of 0.33 mg/kg/dose.

TI  == the prevalence of gentamicin 2'-n-acetyltransferase in the proteeae and its role  in the o-acetylation of peptidoglycan.
AB  == the prevalence of aac(2')-ia, a gene coding for gentamicin 2'-n-acetyltransferase in providencia stuartii, among species of the proteeae was investigated to determine if it is a common resistance factor and whether the correlation observed in p. stuartii between its expression and the levels of peptidoglycan o-acetylation represents a general feature of bacteria producing this form of modified peptidoglycan. an evaluation of the mics of gentamicin for each of the species of the proteeae did not reveal any apparent relationship between resistance and the degree of o-acetylation of peptidoglycan. the entire aac(2')-ia gene was used as a probe in southern hybridization experiments against genomic dna from each species of the proteeae. a sequence with strong homology to aac(2')-ia was present only in proteus penneri while weak hybridization was also  observed to the restriction digested dna from providencia rettgeri. other bacteria that o-acetylate peptidoglycan were also screened with this probe and a  homologous dna sequence was only found in neisseria subflava. these data suggest  that aac(2')-ia may contribute to the o-acetylation of peptidoglycan in p. stuartii, but a more specific enzyme must also be produced for this function.

TI  == a bifunctional urease enhances survival of pathogenic yersinia enterocolitica and morganella morganii at low ph.
AB  == to infect a susceptible host, the gastrointestinal pathogen yersinia enterocolitica must survive passage through the acid environment of the stomach.  in this study, we showed that y. enterocolitica serotype o8 survives buffered acidic conditions as low as ph 1.5 for long periods of time provided urea is available. acid tolerance required an unusual cytoplasmically located urease that was activated 780-fold by low-ph conditions. acid tolerance of helicobacter species has also been attributed to urease activity, but in that case urease was  not specifically activated by low-ph conditions. a ure mutant strain of y. enterocolitica was constructed which was hypersensitive to acidic conditions when urea was available and, unlike the parental strain, was unable to grow when urea  was the sole nitrogen source. examination of other urease-producing gram-negative bacteria indicated that morganella morganii survives in acidic conditions but escherichia coli 1021, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa do not. consistent with these results, biochemical evidence demonstrated that y. enterocolitica and m. morganii ureases  were activated in vitro by low ph with an unusually low activity optimum of ph 5.5. in whole cells activation occurred as medium values decreased below ph 3.0 for y. enterocolitica and ph 5.5 for m. morganii, suggesting that in vivo activation occurs as a result of cytoplasmic acidification. dna sequence analysis of portions of the m. morganii ure locus showed that the predicted primary structure of the enzyme structural subunits is most similar to those of y. enterocolitica urease. one region of similarity between these two ureases located near the active site is distinct from most other ureases but is present in the urease of lactobacillus fermentum. this region of similarity may be responsible for the unique properties of the y. enterocolitica and m. morganii ureases since  the l. fermentum urease also has been shown to have a low ph optimum for activity.

TI  == susceptibility of bacterial isolates to beta-lactam antibiotics from u.s. clinical trials over a 5-year period.
AB  == results are reported for agar dilution susceptibility testing of 3,075 isolates of aerobic bacteria collected from >200 u.s. institutions, located in 30 different states. these isolates were collected from 1987 through 1991 from patients who participated in cefepime clinical trials. cefepime susceptibility was compared with ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefoperazone, and imipenem. to avoid duplication of strains, only initial isolates were included. cefepime minimum inhibitory concentration (mic90) values for enterobacteriaceae were < or = 0.5 microg/ml, except for two species, citrobacter freundii and providencia stuartii, with mic90 values of 2 and 1, respectively. the mic90 values of the other cephalosporins were higher, especially for enterobacter aerogenes and c. freundii. the mic90 values of cefepime for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (4 microg/ml) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 microg/ml) were similar to those of cefotaxime for s. aureus (4 microg/ml), and to ceftazidime for p. aeruginosa (8 microg/ml). streptococcus pneumoniae was similar in susceptibility to cefotaxime at 0.06 microg/ml. the activity of cefepime against a diverse group of gram-positive and gram-negative (1987-1991) bacteria isolates demonstrates the excellent activity of cefepime compared to third-generation cephalosporins and imipenem, particularly among c. freundii and e. aerogenes isolates, which were often resistant to other cephalosporins.

TI  == a multicenter comparative study of the in vitro activity of fleroxacin and other  antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the in vitro activity of fleroxacin was determined by broth microdilution against 2,079 recent bacterial isolates and compared to the activities of ciprofloxacin,  ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefixime, ceftriaxone, amoxicillin/clavulanate, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (tmp-smx), and, as appropriate, erythromycin and oxacillin. most enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by the quinolones at a concentration of < or = 1 microgram/ml; mic90s of fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and lomefloxacin were 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 1 micrograms/ml, respectively. fleroxacin was 2-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against providencia stuartii and serratia marcescens. aside from the quinolones,  ceftriaxone and tmp-smx were the most active antibiotics against the enterobacteriaceae, with mic90s of 8 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively. ciprofloxacin was more active against pseudomonas aeruginosa than the other quinolones, while fleroxacin was more active against stenotrophomonas maltophilia: 17.7, 11.2, 20.0, and 22.4% of p. aeruginosa were resistant to fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae were uniformally susceptible to all antibiotics tested, as were the majority of oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci.  the mic90s of the quinolones and of the beta-lactam antibiotics for oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were 8- to 256-fold higher than for oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci. the beta-lactam antibiotics, tmp-smx, and erythromycin were more active than the quinolones against streptococci; all antibiotics were poorly active against enterococci. fleroxacin is active against  a broad range of gram-negative bacilli and against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci and should prove useful for such infections. however, its use cannot be recommended for infections due to oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, streptococci, or enterococci.

TI  == emergence of bacterial resistance to imipenem and ciprofloxacin in a university hospital.
AB  == we have continuously monitored the in-vitro activities of imipenem and ciprofloxacin against large numbers of non-fastidious clinical isolates. after eight years of use, 97-100% of enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter baumannii remained susceptible to imipenem, but susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa declined from 100% to 91%. after six years of use, 94%-100% of enterobacteriaceae (except providencia stuartii) remained susceptible to ciprofloxacin but susceptibility of p. stuartii, a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa declined from 100%  to 46%, 66% and 84%, respectively. oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were considered to be resistant to imipenem and all beta-lactams. there were no quinolone-resistant staphylococci observed in 1986, but susceptibilities of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus to ciprofloxacin decreased to 85-93% for oxacillin-susceptible strains and to 7-39% for oxacillin-resistant strains. enterococcus faecalis has remained susceptible to imipenem and the modal mic of ciprofloxacin has remained 1 mg/l; however, susceptibility to ciprofloxacin 2 mg/l decreased from 94% to 64%. imipenem-quinolone cross-resistance was observed for staphylococci but not for p. aeruginosa.

TI  == effect of salicylate on expression of flagella by escherichia coli and proteus, providencia, and pseudomonas spp.
AB  == osmotic stress, salicylate, and mar (multiple antibiotic resistance) mutation are known to block the expression of the ompf porin. since these conditions have also been shown to inhibit the expression of p and cfa fimbriae in escherichia coli, we speculated that they might affect the expression of flagella as well. hyperosmotic conditions have been shown to block the synthesis of flagellin and expression of flagella in e. coli (c. li, c. j. louise, w. shi, and j. adler, j.  bacteriol. 175:2229-2235, 1993). in the current study, sodium salicylate was found to inhibit the motility of e. coli, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia rettgeri, and providencia stuartii in a reversible, concentration-dependent manner. swarming did not occur at 20 mm sodium salicylate. salicylate also blocked the synthesis of flagellin in e. coli. phenotypic mar mutants of e. coli derived from motile strains were amotile. flagella were markedly reduced as determined by scanning electron microscopy when p. mirabilis was grown in broth containing 20 mm salicylate. salicylate had no apparent effect, however, on expression of a 40-kda porin protein in p. mirabilis. this finding suggests that the noted effect of salicylate on proteus spp. may be mediated through a mechanism other than porin production or that the  proteus porin may not be analogous to ompf in e. coli. salicylate decreased the motility of pseudomonas cepacia but had no effect on pseudomonas aeruginosa. the  exact mechanism by which salicylate exerts its effect is not known, but it appears to be related to osmoregulation.

TI  == prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance in europe. study group 'bacterial resistance' of the paul-ehrlich-society for chemotherapy e. v.
AB  == since 1984, when the first fluoroquinolone, norfloxacin, was marketed in europe,  there has been a marked increase in the usage of this class of drugs. in order to evaluate the influence of this drug usage on the prevalence of resistance to fluoroquinolones in clinical isolates of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococcus faecalis we reviewed the susceptibility data from four collaborative surveys conducted between 1983 and 1990 by the study group 'bacterial resistance' of the paul-ehrlich-society for chemotherapy. all participating laboratories used the same standardized methods. minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by the broth microdilution method. more than 20,000 bacterial strains were tested. the results are presented for ciprofloxacin, which is regarded as the representative of the fluoroquinolones. using > or = 4 mg/l as a breakpoint for resistance to ciprofloxacin, the prevalence of resistant strains of the family enterobacteriaceae in central europe between 1983 and 1990 remained below 1%. in contrast, the resistance rates in p. aeruginosa were 0.7%, 1.0%, 3.8% and 7.0%, in s. aureus 0%, 0.5%, 6.6% and  6.8%, and in e. faecalis 2.2%, 0.7%, 4.9% and 7.7% in 1983, 1986, 1989 and 1990,  respectively. the latest study carried out in cooperation with 78 laboratories from 12 european countries revealed great differences in the prevalence of resistance to fluoroquinolones from one species to another ranging from 0% with proteus vulgaris and salmonella spp. to 26.7% with providencia stuartii.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == rapid access to pharmacokinetics data and correlation between antimicrobial susceptibility results and drug tissue distribution using a personal computer.
AB  == mymic is a computer-aided system capable of integrating antibiotic susceptibility data with the concentrations the drugs reach in various body tissues and fluids by calculating site concentration/minimal inhibitory concentration quotients. the program can be run on any low-cost personal computer operating under ms-dos, provided it is equipped with a hard-disk drive and with a minimum of 512 kilobytes of random access memory. the use of the program does not require any knowledge of computer languages. the antibiotic susceptibility data can be entered either as minimal inhibitory concentrations or as inhibitory zone diameters; in the latter case, minimal inhibitory concentrations are automatically calculated via regression formulas. the concentrations obtained by  90 antibiotics in 51 different human tissues and fluids are recorded in a data base of over 1,000 records, obtained from roughly 700 original papers. a mymic sample session was simulated by mimicking infections of three different body districts (namely bone, prostate, and sputum) caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli or providencia stuartii.

AB  == antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (caz) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout japan in 1989 and 1991. those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic90 of caz in 1991 were markedly higher against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. also, among other bacteria such as providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to caz were observed in high proportions. however, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of caz on streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella spp, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, haemophilus influenzae and anaerobic gpc (gram-positive cocci). 2. among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant gram-negative bacilli of enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. it appears therefore, that caz failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these  strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. antimicrobial activities of caz on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. however, it was also demonstrated that caz maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. when it is additionally taken into account that caz is one of those limited drugs with activity against p. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that caz still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.

AB  == the gyra genotypes of ciprofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates of escherichia coli (n = 3), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4), providencia stuartii (n = 2), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1), and acinetobacter calcoaceticus (n = 1) were analyzed in a dominance test. this test is based on the dominance of a wild-type  gyra gene (gyra+) over the quinolone resistance allele (gyra) in a heterodiploid  strain. plasmid pbp515, developed to carry the gyra+ gene of e. coli k-12 on a broad-host-range vector derived from prsf1010, was used to obtain heterodiploid strains. plasmid pbp515 encodes kanamycin and gentamicin resistance and is transferable via mobilization by a prp1-derived helper plasmid (prp1h) to strains of several gram-negative species. after the introduction of pbp515, single-cell mics (as measured by reduction of the viable cell count) of ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid decreased by 4- to greater than 8,000-fold for all strains tested, and 8 of the 11 strains regained ciprofloxacin susceptibilities similar to those  of the respective wild types. the results indicate that (i) high-level fluoroquinolone resistance in clinical isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, and a. calcoaceticus can result from mutational alteration of the gyra gene, and (ii) gyra mutations are involved in high levels of fluoroquinolone resistance in p. stuartii. additional mutations outside the gyra locus may contribute to resistance in k. pneumoniae and p. stuartii.

TI  == characterization of fce 22101-resistant enterobacteriaceae and the effect of fce  22101 upon the activity of anti-pseudomonal beta-lactams for pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == twenty-five strains of enterobacteriaceae (five each of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and providencia stuartii) were exposed to fce 22101 in agar containing 3, 5, or 10 x the mic. any putative mutant with a greater than or equal to four-fold increase in the mic was examined for beta-lactamase expression and outer membrane protein (omp) profile.  mutant colonies were selected at a frequency of 10(-7)-10(-11) with decreased susceptibility to fce 22101 and other beta-lactams, but after one subculture on antibiotic-free agar the mutants from 13 of the 25 strains reverted to wild-type. only 19 stable mutants were selected from the other 12 wild-type strains, of which 15 lacked an omp of similar molecular size to ompf, and/or a low size omp of approximately 18 kda. none of the mutants had a significant alteration in expression of richmond & sykes class i beta-lactamase. in a separate section of the study in which 50 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were examined, it was found that fce 22101, at a concentration of 4 mg/l, induced beta-lactamase expression such that, after 24 h exposure, 24 of the 50 strains had a greater than or equal to four-fold rise in the mic of several anti-pseudomonal beta-lactams.

TI  == beta-lactamase expression and outer membrane protein changes in cefpirome-resistant and ceftazidime-resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == twenty-five strains of enterobacteriaceae (five each of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and providencia stuartii) and five strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were exposed to various concentrations of cefpirome or ceftazidime in agar. mutants with a greater than four-fold increase in the mic were examined for changes in beta-lactamase expression and outer membrane protein (omp) profile. both agents selected mutants with decreased susceptibility to the selecting antibiotic and other beta-lactams  at a frequency of 10(-7)-10(-8). the mics of all beta-lactams were higher for the resistant mutants of e. cloacae and p. aeruginosa than for the other species. both agents selected mutants expressing derepressed class i beta-lactamase, but this was more common with ceftazidime. only a few mutants of p. aeruginosa and e. cloacae had an mic of cefpirome that was above the recommended breakpoint concentration. some mutant strains of enterobacteriaceae lacked an omp of molecular size similar to ompf, but the mic of cefpirome was below the breakpoint concentration for all these strains.

TI  == in vitro activity of an oxycephem ocp 9-176 compared with its sulfur analog and other beta-lactams.
AB  == ocp 9-176 is an oxycephem antibiotic that contains a 2-aminothiazolyl, carboxypropyl side chain at c-7 and a pyridinium thiomethyl group at c-3. ocp 9-176 was generally twofold less active than its sulfur-containing analog me 1228 against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, providencia  stuartii, proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens. activity against enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii was equivalent. ocp 9-176 was twofold less active than me-1228 against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter species. activity of the two agents was similar against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. although ocp 9-176 inhibited e. coli containing tem-1 and tem-2, it was less active than me-1228. klebsiella organisms with shv-1 and k-2 beta-lactamases were inhibited, but tem-3-containing isolates had mics of 16  micrograms/ml. ocp 9-176 was minimally hydrolyzed by tem-1, pse-1, k-1, and p99,  and it was a poor inhibitor of p99. replacement of sulfur with oxygen does not increase the activity of compounds with sulfopyridinium methyl groups at c-3.

TI  == antibody coated bacteria in urine of patients with recent spinal injury.
AB  == twenty patients with an acute spinal injury were prospectively studied to assess  the clinical importance of antibody coated bacteria (acb) in the urine and the association among the different bacterial species with a positive antibody coated bacteria test. clinical urinary tract infection was associated with a positive acb test on 45% of occasions. three hundred and ninety nine urine samples containing 541 bacterial isolates were assessed for the presence of acb; 13% were found to be positive and 87% negative for acb; 67% of urines contained a single bacterial isolate. pseudomonas aeruginosa was most commonly associated with clinical urinary tract infection, found in 25% of episodes, followed by proteus mirabilis (17.5%), klebsiella sp (12.5%), and proteus morganii (10%). providencia stuartii, however, was most commonly associated with a positive acb test (found in 17%). other bacteria associated with a positive acb test included klebsiella sp (14%), acinetobacter sp (12.5%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12%), citrobacter sp  (11.5%). a positive acb test is not to be expected from a patient with spinal injury who has a catheter in place, and the test may provide a useful guide to identify those patients with an invasive infection. it is doubtful that a decision to treat or not treat bacteriuria could rest on the identification of the bacterial species alone.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of cefodizime: a review.
AB  == for enterobacteriaceae, mic50s and mic90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: escherichia  coli 0.12 and 0.5, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, serratia  marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. the activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. haemophilus spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as n. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic50s and mic90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic50 and mic90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were generally resistant: streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (mic50 and mic90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium perfringens (mic50 and mic90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). these results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.

TI  == do clinical microbiology laboratories report complete bacteriology in urine from  patients with long-term urinary catheters?
AB  == bacteriuria associated with long-term urinary catheters (those in place for greater than or equal to 30 days) appears to be the most common nosocomial infection in u.s. medical care facilities. this bacteriuria is polymicrobial and  dynamic and accompanied by fevers, catheter obstructions, bacteremias, and deaths. we compared the reporting by our research laboratory of bacteria present  in urine from long-term-catheterized nursing home patients with that by two commercial laboratories. the commercial laboratories isolated significantly fewer bacterial species at 10(5) cfu/ml of urine specimen. organisms well recognized as causes of urinary tract infections in noncatheterized patients (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae) were isolated in comparable frequencies by both the research and commercial laboratories. however, other organisms, including uncommon uropathogens like providencia stuartii and morganella morganii, which were actually among the most frequent bacteriuric species in these long-term-catheterized patients, were isolated significantly less frequently by the commercial laboratories. reasons for the discrepancies are unclear but may involve use of different techniques. more complete reporting may  lead to better understanding of the polymicrobial bacteriuria of long-term catheters and its associated complications. this, in turn, may result in improved patient care and infection control in nursing homes.

AB  == a total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. the strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of escherichia coli (314), enterobacter aerogenes (30), e. agglomerans (7), e. cloacae, (39), citrobacter diversus (9), c. freundii (13), hafnia alvei (3), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), klebsiella oxytoca (6), k. ozaenae (5), k. pneumoniae (107), morganella morganii (3), moraxella sp.

TI  == inducible type i beta-lactamases of gram-negative bacteria and resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == mutants, showing either constitutive (depressed) or non-inducible expression of chromosomally-mediated type i beta-lactamase were obtained from clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae, ent. aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the wild-type and mutant strains were compared for susceptibility to a range of beta-lactam antibiotics. derepression of beta-lactamase synthesis generally, but  not always, resulted in a marked reduction in susceptibility to the agents tested, including the '3rd generation' cephalosporins. in many cases, the observed resistance would preclude, or severely compromise, the therapeutic efficacy of the drugs. in this context, depressed mutants of enterobacter spp., citro. freundii and ps. aeruginosa could be of primary concern although those of  ser. marcescens, prov. stuartii and morg. morganii often exhibited equally high resistance levels to older beta-lactams. comparison of the susceptibilities of the non-inducible mutants with that of their inducible parents suggested variation in the beta-lactamase inductive potency of different compounds in different organisms. for example, cefoxitin was a powerful inducer in ent. cloacae, citro. freundii and one strain of ps. aeruginosa; similarly cefazolin and cefuroxime were good beta-lactamase inducers in ser. marcescens and morg. morganii. aminothiazolyl-oxime cephalosporins and ureido-penicillins were generally poor inducers. from such comparisons, the contribution of inducible type i beta-lactamase to resistance phenotype could be ascertained.

TI  == providencia stuartii: a common cause of antibiotic-resistant bacteriuria in patients with long-term indwelling catheters.
AB  == the long-term-catheterized urinary tract may offer a particular niche to providencia stuartii, which is otherwise an uncommon clinical isolate. published  accounts of bacteriuria in patients catheterized for long periods indicate that p. stuartii has often been found as frequently as familiar uropathogens such as escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. as in most nosocomial infections, the frequency of isolation of a given species has  commonly differed among institutions. in the future p. stuartii may be more frequently encountered as a nosocomial pathogen in nursing homes and in acute care hospitals to which bacteriuric patients are transferred. this trend appears  likely because of the increasingly large nursing-home population, the predilection of the bacterium for the long-term-catheterized urinary tract, the opportunity for nosocomial transmission from this reservoir, the resistance of the organism to multiple antibiotics, and the occasional systemic illness and bacteremia caused by p. stuartii.

TI  == selection of multiple antibiotic resistance by quinolones, beta-lactams, and aminoglycosides with special reference to cross-resistance between unrelated drug classes.
AB  == the ability of three quinolones, two beta-lactams, and one aminoglycoside to select resistant mutants was examined in tests with 30 isolates of commonly encountered nosocomial pathogens. ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, two new quinolone derivatives, were no more likely to select resistant mutants than amikacin, whereas nalidixic acid, an older quinolone derivative, was the most likely of the six drugs examined to select resistant mutants. mutational frequencies of 10(-7) to 10(-8) were observed in most instances. in general, the  mutants were 8 to 16 times less susceptible to the drug used for selection. although most quinolone-selected mutants were cross-resistant only to other drugs within this class, certain mutants of klebsiella pneumoniae selected by nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, or norfloxacin were also less susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. this unusual pattern of multiple drug resistance was associated with changes in outer membrane proteins of the organism. multiple drug resistance was  also observed in beta-lactam-selected mutants of enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa (beta-lactams), amikacin-selected mutants of providencia stuartii and p. aeruginosa (aminoglycosides), and beta-lactam- or amikacin-selected mutants of serratia marcescens (beta-lactams plus aminoglycosides). these results underscore the need to examine carefully the frequency with which resistance to any new antibiotic develops, as well as the patterns of multiple drug resistance which may occur simultaneously.

AB  == pse-2, a plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase which was previously considered pseudomonas specific, was observed in clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, providencia stuartii, and enterobacter cloacae. all four isolates transferred pse-2 production, together with resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin, kanamycin, and sulfamethoxazole, into escherichia coli j62-1 and pseudomonas aeruginosa pu21. transfer correlated with acquisition by the transconjugants of a 65-megadalton plasmid, and this element was considered to encode pse-2 expression. the pse-2 enzyme conferred high-level carbenicillin resistance on both j62-1 and pu21 transconjugants, although the pse-2-producing providencia stuartii isolate was susceptible to carbenicillin.

AB  == the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (sce 1365), a new cephalosporin derivate was compared with two other "third generation" cephalosporins: cefotaxime and moxalactam. cefmenoxime as cefotaxime and moxalactam were very active against 305 cephalosporinase-producing and cephalosporinase-non-producing enterobacteriaceae. cefmenoxime was the most active against serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, morganella morganii, salmonella, shigella and yersinia enterocolitica with a mean mic at least twice lower. several strains of the species hafnia alvei, providencia stuartii and proteus vulgaris were more resistant. against haemophilus influenzae, the activity of the three cephalosporins was higher with  a mean mic between 0,030 and 0,040 microgram/ml. against carbenicillin-sensible or carpenicillin-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa or acinetobacter calcoaceticus, the three cephalosporins were not performant. against staphylococcus aureus, cefmenoxime and cefotaxime had an identical activity with a mean mic of 1,5 microgram/ml against methicillin-sensible strains and a mean mic of 5,5 micrograms/ml against methicillin-resistant strains.

TI  == cefotetan: profile of in-vitro activity.
AB  == cefotetan, a novel 7 alpha-methoxy cephalosporin, was shown to be comparable to other third-generation cephalosporins when tested in vitro against 1063 gram-negative clinical isolates of 11 species. ninety per cent of all isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, proteus rettgeri, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens and citrobacter freundii were inhibited by concentrations of cefotetan between 0.07 and 3.2 mg/l. activity against gram-positive cocci was about equal to that of moxalactam. pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter were resistant. cefotetan inhibited about two-thirds of enterobacter strains at 16 mg/l. beta-lactamases of enterobacter cloacae highly resistant to cefotetan inactivated this cephamycin. these strains were resistant to most other beta-lactams as well. synergism between cefotetan and aminoglycosides was found in 8 out of 16 gram-negatives.

TI  == inactivation of cephalosporins by beta-lactamases of gram-negative rods.
AB  == intracellular beta-lactamase activity of gram-negative rods (four pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, one strain each of enterobacter cloacae, proteus rettgeri, providencia stuartii and serratia marcescens) was greatly increased by subinhibitory concentrations of cefoxitin, with the exception of one p. aeruginosa strain. cefotaxime, cefoperazone and ceftazidime were much less effective as enzyme inducers in these strains. a reduction in beta-lactamase activity after pre-incubation with cephalosporins was observed for particular strains and substances. susceptibility to beta-lactamases decreased in the following sequence: cephalothin, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefoxitin. there was a good correlation between the degradation of cephalosporins in uninduced cells of enterobacteriaceae and the minimal inhibitory concentrations except for cefoxitin.

TI  == a prospective microbiologic study of bacteriuria in patients with chronic indwelling urethral catheters.
AB  == bacteriuria is common in chronically catheterized patients and is associated with both acute and chronic complications. of 605 consecutive weekly urine specimens from 20 chronically catheterized patients, 98% contained bacteria at high concentrations and 77% were polymicrobial. the mean interval between new episodes of bacteriuria was 1.8 weeks. most species of bacteria caused five to seven new episodes of bacteriuria per 100 weeks of catheterization. even though access to the catheter lumen was similar, the duration of bacteriuric episodes varied greatly by species. of the episodes of bacteriuria caused by nonenterococcal gram-positive cocci, greater than 75% lasted less than one week. mean durations of episodes of bacteriuria due to escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were four to six weeks, whereas those due to providencia stuartii averaged 10 weeks and ranged up to 36 weeks. thus, the very high prevalence of bacteriuria--virtually 100%--was a result of a high incidence caused by many different species combined with the prolonged residence of some gram-negative bacilli in the catheter and urinary tract.

TI  == clinical efficacy of cefotaxime in serious infections.
AB  == thirty-five patients underwent 38 treatment courses with cefotaxime. documented infections included 11 bacteremias, 7 cases of nosocomial pneumonia, 6 surgical wound infections, 3 bone infections, 1 biliary infection, and 1 urinary tract infection. granulocytopenic patients with fever received 15 courses of empiric cefotaxime therapy alone; in 8 courses, no definite site of infection or pathogen was isolated. broad-spectrum antibiotics had been administered to 23 patients before cefotaxime. thirty-seven bacterial pathogens were isolated from 25 patients. three such pathogens were resistant to cefotaxime and required alternative therapies. pathogenic isolates included 13 serratia marcescens, 12 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 escherichia coli, 2 klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 providencia stuartii, 1 enterobacter cloacae, 1 haemophilus influenzae, 1 enterococcus, and 1 staphylococcus aureus. of the treatment courses, 25 of 38 resulted in a favorable response to cefotaxime, including 9 of 15 in granulocytopenic patients. superinfection was seen in one patient. the emergence  of resistance was documented in another patient. of 15 patients with multiply resistant pathogens, 12 improved with cefotaxime. of 12 patients with pseudomonas aeruginosa, 6 favorably responded. possible complications of cefotaxime were observed in 14 of 42 treatment courses. cefotaxime is most useful in treatment of infections due to multiply resistant, gram-negative pathogens other than pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == some observations on the activity of three antiseptics used as bladder irrigants  in the treatment of urinary tract infection in patients with indwelling catheters.
AB  == a comparison has been made of the activity of three antiseptics that are used as  bladder irrigants in the treatment of urinary tract infection in catheterised patients. at the concentrations and exposure times used for bladder irrigation, phenoxyethanol (2:4% v/v) proved to be highly bactericidal against urine-grown cells of all the common urinary pathogens tested. chlorhexidine (200 microgram/ml) was active against escherichia coli and produced significant reductions in the viability of klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa but failed to eradicate providencia stuartii. exposure to  noxythiolin (2.5% v/v) for 20 min had little effect in any of the bacteria, even  though all strains tested had been recorded as noxythiolin-sensitive by conventional plate sensitivity tests. contact with noxythiolin for periods of at  least 1-2 hrs was necessary before extensive bactericidal activity was detected.  these results provide an explanation of the poor clinical performance of noxythiolin that we have observed.

TI  == short-course aminoglycoside therapy in patients with spinal cord injury. standard dose versus low dose.
AB  == twenty-nine patients with spinal cord injury and asymptomatic urinary tract infection were treated with standard or reduced doses of tobramycin and amikacin. the patients received five days of intramuscular antibiotics. most of the patients in the tobramycin groups had pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and most of those in the amikacin group had either proteus rettgeri or providencia stuartii infections. only 1 patient had a positive urine antibody coating test. high antibiotic concentrations were demonstrated in the urine of all patients during therapy. urine cultures were obtained two and seven days after completion  of therapy. forty-eight per cent of the patients were cured, while 31 per cent showed persistence or relapse, and 21 per cent had reinfection with other bacteria. no significant differences in results were observed between the standard-dose and low-dose regimens and between the amikacin and tobramycin groups. the low success rate of the regimens used may indicate the need to evaluate alternative therapeutic regimens to treat urinary tract infections in this special group of patients.

TI  == comparative activities of the oxa-beta-lactam ly127935, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, cefamandole, and ticarcillin against multiply resistant gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == a total of 91 multiply resistant bacterial strains, including klebsiella pneumoniae (32 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (16 strains), and serratia marcescens (43 strains), were collected during hospital epidemics of nosocomial infection from 1975 to 1979. these strains were resistant to gentamicin, tobramycin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin. their susceptibility to three new broad-spectrum beta-lactams, ly127935 (a 1-oxa-beta-lactam), cefotaxime (hr 756), and cefoperazone (t 1551), was compared with the susceptibility of random strains of nine species of aerobic gram-negative bacilli collected in the  same hospital in 1979. susceptibility to cefamandole and ticarcillin was also determined. strains of staphylococci and streptococci from that hospital and two  nearby city-county hospitals were also compared for the three new cephalosporins  and other effective antibiotics. the agar dilution method was used to measure the minimum inhibitory concentration for each antibiotic. the multiply resistant strains (minimum inhibitory concentration for gentamicin >/= 8 mug/ml) usually were as susceptible to the three new broad-spectrum beta-lactams as were non-multiply resistant strains. both klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia marcescens, including multiply resistant and non-multiply resistant strains, were most susceptible to the 1-oxa-beta-lactam ly127935 and cefotaxime. p. aeruginosa  (both multiply resistant and non-multiply resistant strains) were most susceptible to cefoperazone. all three new beta-lactams were active against non-multiply resistant strains of escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., proteus spp., and citrobacter spp. providencia stuartii were most susceptible to cefotaxime and the 1-oxa-beta-lactam ly127935. the three new beta-lactams were all less active against staphylococci (especially methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus) than cephalothin. streptococcus pyogenes and s. pneumoniae were very susceptible to cefotaxime and cefoperazone, though less susceptible to  ly127935. none of the three new beta-lactams was active against s. faecalis. all  were very active against both penicillinase-positive and -negative strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae.

TI  == hr 756, a highly active cephalosporin: comparison with cefazolin and carbenicillin.
AB  == hr 756, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with cefazolin and carbenicillin for activity against a total of 264 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, proteus spp. (indole positive), enterobacter spp., salmonella typhi, serratia marcescens, providencia stuartii, and staphylococcus aureus. in every comparison, except that with the last organism, hr 756 was clearly more active than cefazolin and carbenicillin. all three compounds had similar activity against penicillin-susceptible staphylococci; against penicillin-resistant strains, hr 756 and cefazolin were equally active and superior to carbenicillin. hr 756 was compared with penicillin for activity against strains of streptococcus pyogenes,  lancefield group d streptococci, and neisseria gonorrhoeae; with ampicillin against haemophilus influenzae; and with cefoxitin against bacteriodes fragilis.  hr 756 was clearly more active than the respective reference compounds in all of  these comparisons, except those involving the streptococci. hr 756 and penicillin were essentially equally active against s. pyogenes; against lancefield group d,  penicillin was 32 times as active as hr 756. hr 756 not only compared favorably with the reference compounds with respect to relative activity, but also effected growth inhibition of essentially all test organisms (p. aeruginosa and group d streptococci excepted) at remarkably low concentrations ranging from 0.015 to 2.0 mug/ml. a series of seven transfers of selected strains of e. coli, klebsiella spp., s. aureus, and p. aeruginosa through medium containing hr 756 led to emergence of strains with significant levels of resistance to the agent. resistance to hr 756 was retained for at least seven transfers through plain medium.
