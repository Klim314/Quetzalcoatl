TI  - Cumate-inducible gene expression system for sphingomonads and other Alphaproteobacteria.
AB  - Tunable promoters represent a pivotal genetic tool for a wide range of applications. Here we present such a system for sphingomonads, a phylogenetically diverse group of bacteria that have gained much interest for their potential in bioremediation and their use in industry and for which no dedicated inducible gene expression system has been described so far. A strong, constitutive synthetic promoter was first identified through a genetic screen and subsequently combined with the repressor and the operator sites of the Pseudomonas putida F1 cym/cmt system. The resulting promoter, termed PQ5, responds rapidly to the inducer cumate and shows a maximal induction ratio of 2 to 3 orders of magnitude in the different sphingomonads tested. Moreover, it was also functional in other Alphaproteobacteria, such as the model organisms Caulobacter crescentus, Paracoccus denitrificans, and Methylobacterium extorquens. In the noninduced state, expression from PQ5 is low enough to allow gene depletion analysis, as demonstrated with the essential gene phyP of Sphingomonas sp. strain Fr1. A set of PQ5-based plasmids has been constructed allowing fusions to affinity tags or fluorescent proteins.
TI  - Molecular determinants for substrate selectivity of omega-transaminases.
AB  - omega-Transaminase (omega-TA) is an industrially important enzyme for production  of chiral amines. About 20 (S)-specific omega-TAs known to date show remarkably similar substrate selectivity characterized by stringent steric constraint precluding entry of a substituent larger than an ethyl group in the small binding pocket (S) and dual recognition of an aromatic substituent as well as a carboxylate group in the large pocket (L). The strictly defined substrate selectivity of the available omega-TAs remains a limiting factor in the production of structurally diverse chiral amines. In this work, we cloned, purified, and characterized three new omega-TAs from Ochrobactrum anthropi, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Acetobacter pasteurianus that were identified by a BLASTP search using the previously studied omega-TA from Paracoccus denitrificans. All the new omega-TAs exhibited similar substrate specificity, which led us to explore whether the molecular determinants for the substrate specificity are conserved among the omega-TAs. To this end, key active site residues were identified by docking simulation using the X-ray structure of the omega-TA from Pseudomonas putida. We found that the dual recognition in the L pocket is ascribed to Tyr23, Phe88*, and Tyr152 for hydrophobic interaction and Arg414 for recognition of a carboxylate group. In addition, the docking simulation indicates that Trp60 and Ile262 form the S pocket where the substituent size up to an ethyl group turns out to be sterically allowed. The six key residues were found to be essentially conserved among nine omega-TA sequences, underlying the molecular basis for the high similarity in the substrate selectivity.
TI  - Formation of palladium(0) nanoparticles at microbial surfaces.
AB  - The increasing demand and limited natural resources for industrially important platinum-group metal (PGM) catalysts render the recovery from secondary sources such as industrial waste economically interesting. In the process of palladium (Pd) recovery, microorganisms have revealed a strong potential. Hitherto, bacteria with the property of dissimilatory metal reduction have been in focus, although the biochemical reactions linking enzymatic Pd(II) reduction and Pd(0) deposition have not yet been identified. In this study we investigated Pd(II) reduction with formate as the electron donor in the presence of Gram-negative bacteria with no documented capacity for reducing metals for energy production: Cupriavidus necator, Pseudomonas putida, and Paracoccus denitrificans. Only large and close-packed Pd(0) aggregates were formed in cell-free buffer solutions. Pd(II) reduction in the presence of bacteria resulted in smaller, well-suspended Pd(0) particles that were associated with the cells (called "bioPd(0)" in the following). Nanosize Pd(0) particles (3-30 nm) were only observed in the presence of bacteria, and particles in this size range were located in the periplasmic space. Pd(0) nanoparticles were still deposited on autoclaved cells of C. necator that had no hydrogenase activity, suggesting a hydrogenase-independent formation mechanism. The catalytic properties of Pd(0) and bioPd(0) were determined by the amount of hydrogen released in a reaction with hypophosphite. Generally, bioPd(0) demonstrated a lower level of activity than the Pd(0) control, possibly due to the inaccessibility of the Pd(0) fraction embedded in the cell envelope. Our results demonstrate the suitability of bacterial cells for the recovery of Pd(0), and formation and immobilization of Pd(0) nanoparticles inside the cell envelope. However, procedures to make periplasmic Pd(0) catalytically accessible need to be developed for future nanobiotechnological applications.
TI  - Elucidation of dominant effect on initial bacterial adhesion onto polymer surfaces prepared by radiation-induced graft polymerization.
AB  - Surface-modified polyethylene (PE) membrane sheets were prepared by the radiation-induced graft polymerization (RIGP) of an epoxy-group-containing monomer, glycidyl methacrylate (GMA). The epoxy ring of GMA was opened by introducing diethylamine (DEA) or sodium sulfite (SS). We examined the properties of these sheets by measuring the amount of grafting polymer, surface roughness and membrane potential, and also investigated the adhesion of five Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Paracoccus denitrificans, onto the prepared sheet surfaces. A linear relationship between the degree of grafting (dg) and surface roughness was observed. Moreover, membrane potential was dependent on the amount of DEA or SS as the ionizable group. These results indicate that RIGP enables the control of the physicochemical properties of such a sheet surface by adjusting dg and the subsequent conversion of functional groups. A batch test on bacterial adhesion onto the sheets clarified that the DEA-containing sheet (DEA sheet) exhibited an adhesion rate constant, k, significantly greater than those of other types of sheet. Clearly, the adhesion rate constant of the DEA sheet increased with dg, indicating that electrostatic interaction is the most decisive factor for bacterial adhesion when it works as an attractive force. Furthermore, the densities of bacteria adhering onto the GMA-containing sheet (GMA sheet) and the SS-containing sheet (SS sheet) were almost the same as that onto a PE sheet, whereas that onto a DEA sheet significantly increased. Thus, the introduction of the GMA- and SS-containing graft chain did not have much influence on bacterial adhesion onto the surfaces, supporting the conclusion that the promotion of bacterial adhesion onto the GMA and SS sheets was due to an increase in surface area resulting from RIGP. Moreover, the scanning electron microscopy images of the sheet surfaces indicate that the conditions and morphologies of initial bacterial adhesion are dependent on surface properties, particularly membrane potential.
TI  - Isolation and biochemical characterization of two soluble iron(III) reductases from Paracoccus denitrificans.
AB  - Two soluble enzymes (FerA and FerB) catalyzing the reduction of a number of iron(III) complexes by NADH, were purified to near homogeneity from the aerobically grown iron-limited culture of Paracoccus denitrificans using a combination of anion-exchange chromatography (Sepharose Q), chromatofocusing (Mono P), and gel permeation chromatography (Superose 12). FerA is a monomer with a molecular mass of 19 kDa, whereas FerB exhibited a molecular mass of about 55 kDa and consists of probably two identical subunits. FerA can be classified as an NADH:flavin oxidoreductase with a sequential reaction mechanism. It requires the addition of FMN or riboflavin for activity on Fe(III) substrates. In these reactions, the apparent substrate specificity of FerA seems to stem exclusively from different chemical reactivities of Fe(III) compounds with the free reduced flavin produced by the enzyme. Observations on reducibility of Fe(III) chelated by vicinal dihydroxy ligands support the view that FerA takes part in releasing iron from the catechol type siderophores synthesized by P. denitrificans. Contrary to FerA, the purified FerB contains a noncovalently bound redox-active FAD coenzyme, can utilize NADPH in place of NADH, does not reduce free FMN at an appreciable rate, and gives a ping-pong type kinetic pattern with NADH and Fe(III)-nitrilotriacetate as substrates. FerB is able to reduce chromate, in agreement with the fact that its N-terminus bears a homology to the previously described chromate reductase from Pseudomonas putida. Besides this, it also readily reduces quinones like ubiquinone-0 (Q0) or unsubstituted p-benzoquinone.
TI  - X-ray structure of methanol dehydrogenase from Paracoccus denitrificans and molecular modeling of its interactions with cytochrome c-551i.
AB  - The X-ray structure of methanol dehydrogenase (MEDH) from Paracoccus denitrificans (MEDH-PD) was determined at 2.5 A resolution using molecular replacement based on the structure of MEDH from Methylophilus methylotrophus W3A1 (MEDH-WA). The overall structures from the two bacteria are similar to each other except that the former has a longer C-terminal tail in each subunit and shows local differences in several insertion regions. The "X-ray sequence" of the segment alphaGly444-alphaLeu452 was established, including one insertion and seven replacements compared with the reported sequence. The primary electron acceptor of MEDH-PD is cytochrome c-551i (Cyt c551i). Based on the crystal structure of MEDH-PD and of the published structure of Cyt c551i, their interactions were investigated by molecular modeling. As a guide and starting point, the covalently attached cytochrome and PQQ domains of the alcohol dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida HK5 (ADH2B) were used. In the modeling, two molecules of Cyt c551i could be accommodated in their interaction with the MEDH heterotetramer in accordance with the two-fold molecular symmetry of the latter. Two models are proposed, in both of which electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions make major contributions to inter-protein binding. One of these models involves salt bridges from alphaArg99 of MEDH to the heme propionic acids of Cyt c551i and the other involves salt bridges from alphaArg426 of MEDH to Glu112 of Cyt c551i. Both involve salt bridges from alphaLys93 of MEDH to Asp75 of Cyt c551i. The size and nature of the cytochrome/quinoprotein heterodimer interfaces and calculations of electronic coupling and electron transfer rates favor one of these models over the other.
TI  - Heterologous expression of heterotrophic nitrification genes.
AB  - Paracoccus denitrificans is a heterotrophic organism capable of oxidizing ammonia to nitrite during growth on an organic carbon and energy source. This pathway, termed heterotrophic nitrification, requires the concerted action of an ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) and hydroxylamine oxidase (HAO). The genes required for heterotrophic nitrification have been isolated by introducing a Pa. denitrificans genomic library into Pseudomonas putida and screening for the accumulation of nitrite. In contrast to the situation in chemolithoautotrophic ammonia oxidizers, the genes encoding AMO and HAO are present in single linked copies in the genome of Pa. denitrificans. AMO from Pa. denitrificans expressed in Ps. putida is capable of oxidizing ethene (ethylene) to epoxyethane (ethylene oxide), which is indicative of a relaxed substrate specificity. Further, when expressed in the methylotroph Methylobacterium extorquens AM1, the AMO endows on this organism the ability to grow on ethene and methane. Thus, the Pa. denitrificans AMO is capable of oxidizing methane to methanol, as is the case for the AMO from Nitrosomonas europaea. The heterotrophic nitrification genes are moderately toxic in M. extorquens, more toxic in Ps. putida, and non-toxic in Escherichia coli. Toxicity is due to the activity of the gene products in M. extorquens, and both expression and activity in Ps. putida. This is the first time that the genes encoding an active AMO have been expressed in a heterologous host.
TI  - Secretion of human epidermal growth factor (EGF) in autotrophic culture by a recombinant hydrogen-utilizing bacterium, Pseudomonas pseudoflava, carrying broad-host-range EGF secretion vector pKSEGF2.
AB  - We constructed the broad-host-range human epidermal growth factor (EGF) secretion plasmid pKSEGF2 by inserting the Escherichia coli tac promoter, the signal sequence of Pseudomonas stutzeri amylase, and the synthesized EGF gene into the broad-host-range vector pKT230. E. coli JM109 carrying pKSEGF2 secreted EGF into the periplasm and the culture medium under the control of the tac promoter. Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1161 carrying pKSEGF2 and Pseudomonas putida AC10 carrying pKSEGF2 secreted EGF into the culture medium constitutively. Four hydrogen-utilizing bacteria, Pseudomonas pseudoflava, Alcaligenes eutrophus, Alcaligenes paradoxus, and Paracoccus denitrificans, were transconjugated with pKSEGF2 from eight hydrogen-utilizing bacteria tested. In these transconjugated hydrogen-utilizing bacteria, P. pseudoflava carrying pKSEGF2 grew autotrophically and secreted EGF, confirmed by Western blot (immunoblot) analysis, into the culture medium constitutively.
TI  - Molecular characterization of microbial alcohol dehydrogenases.
AB  - There is an astonishing array of microbial alcohol oxidoreductases. They display  a wide variety of substrate specificities and they fulfill several vital but quite different physiological functions. Some of these enzymes are involved in the production of alcoholic beverages and of industrial solvents, others are important in the production of vinegar, and still others participate in the degradation of naturally occurring and xenobiotic aromatic compounds as well as in the growth of bacteria and yeasts on methanol. They can be divided into three major categories. (1) The NAD- or NADP-dependent dehydrogenases. These can in turn be divided into the group I long-chain (approximately 350 amino acid residues) zinc-dependent enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenases I, II, and III of Saccharomyces cerevisiae or the plasmid-encoded benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase of Pseudomonas putida; the group II short-chain (approximately 250 residues) zinc-independent enzymes such as ribitol dehydrogenase of Klebsiella aerogenes; the group III "iron-activated" enzymes that generally contain approximately 385 amino acid residues, such as alcohol dehydrogenase II of Zymomonas mobilis and alcohol dehydrogenase IV of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but may contain almost 900 residues in the case of the multifunctional alcohol dehydrogenases of Escherichia coli and Clostridium acetobutylicum. The aldehyde/alcohol oxidoreductase of Amycolatopsis methanolica and the methanol dehydrogenases of A. methanolica and Mycobacterium gasti are 4-nitroso-N,N-dimethylaniline-dependent nicotinoproteins. (2) NAD(P)-independent enzymes that use pyrroloquinoline quinone, haem or cofactor F420 as cofactor, exemplified by methanol dehydrogenase of Paracoccus denitrificans, ethanol dehydrogenase of Acetobacter and Gluconobacter spp. and the alcohol dehydrogenases of certain archaebacteria. (3) Oxidases that catalyze an essentially irreversible oxidation of alcohols, such as methanol oxidase of Hansenula polymorpha and probably the veratryl alcohol oxidases of certain fungi involved in lignin degradation. This review deals mainly with those enzymes for which complete amino acid sequences are available. The discussion focuses on a comparison of their primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures and their catalytic mechanisms. The physiological roles of the enzymes and isoenzymes are also considered, as are their probable evolutionary relationships.
TI  - Transposable elements for efficient manipulation of a wide range of gram-negative bacteria: promoter probes and vectors for foreign genes.
AB  - We describe here the construction and use of a series of modified transposons based on the insertion sequence IS1. Like their parent, omegon-Km [Fellay et al., Gene 76 (1989) 215-226], these elements permit efficient insertional mutagenesis of a variety of Gram-negative bacteria. The presence of a functional pBR322 origin of replication within the transposable element facilitates subsequent cloning of the mutated gene. The omegon-Km system was previously shown to function in Pseudomonas putida, Rhizobium leguminosarum and Paracoccus denitrificans. The results we present here demonstrate that its use can be extended to Xanthomonas campestris, a plant pathogen, and to the microaeroduric Zymomonas mobilis. Derivative transposons carrying unique restriction sites for ScaI, NdeI, XbaI and XhoI have been constructed, allowing the cloning and introduction of foreign genes. We have also constructed two derivatives which can be used to generate operon fusions upon insertion and are thus useful for isolating and characterising indigenous promoters. One carries a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase (CAT)-encoding gene (cat) and the second, the entire promoterless Escherichia coli lac operon. We demonstrate the utility of the cat promoter probe in X. campestris to target conditional promoters inducible by high salt or subject to repression by glucose.
TI  - Omegon-Km: a transposable element designed for in vivo insertional mutagenesis and cloning of genes in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - To combine the features of the omega interposons with the advantages of in vivo transposition mutagenesis, we have constructed an artificial transposon, called Omegon-Km. The Omegon-Km transposon is carried on the plasmid pJFF350 which can be conjugally mobilized into a broad range of Gram-negative bacteria. Omegon-Km is flanked, in inverted orientation, by synthetic 28-bp repeats derived from the ends of IS1. In addition, each end of Omegon-Km has the very efficient transcription and translation terminators of the omega interposon. Internally, Omegon-Km carries the selectable kanamycin (Km)-neomycin resistance gene (alph A) which is expressed well in many Gram-negative bacteria. The IS1 transposition functions are located on the donor plasmid but external to Omegon-Km. Thus, insertions of Omegon-Km are very stable because they lack the capacity for further transposition. Omegon-Km mutagenesis is performed by conjugal transfer of pJFF350 from Escherichia coli into any Gram-negative recipient strain in which this plasmid is unable to replicate. Those cells which have had a transposition event are selected by their resistance to Km. Very high frequencies of Omegon-Km transposition were observed in Pseudomonas putida. Preliminary experiments with other Gram-negative soil and water bacteria (Rhizobium leguminosarum, Paracoccus denitrificans) yielded mutants at reasonable levels. The presence of an E. coli-specific origin of replication (ori) within Omegon-Km allows the rapid and easy cloning, in E. coli, of the nucleotide sequences flanking the site of the transposition event.
TI  - Interposon mutagenesis of soil and water bacteria: a family of DNA fragments designed for in vitro insertional mutagenesis of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - We have constructed a series of derivatives of the omega interposon [Prentki and  Krisch, Gene 29 (1984) 303-313] that can be used for in vitro insertional mutagenesis. Each of these DNA fragments carries a different antibiotic or Hg2+ resistance gene (ApR, CmR, TcR, KmR or HgR) which is flanked, in inverted orientation, by transcription and translation termination signals and by synthetic polylinkers. The DNA of these interposons can be easily purified and then inserted, by in vitro ligation, into a plasmid linearized either at random by DNase I or at specific sites by restriction enzymes. Plasmid molecules which contain an interposon insertion can be identified by expression of its drug resistance. The position of the interposon can be precisely mapped by the restriction sites in the flanking polylinker. To verify their properties we have used these omega derivatives to mutagenize a broad host range plasmid which contains the entire meta-cleavage pathway of the toluene degradation plasmid pWW0 of Pseudomonas putida. Insertion of these interposons in the plasmid between the promoter and the catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O) gene dramatically reduced the expression of this enzyme in Escherichia coli. We also show that when a plasmid containing an omega interposon is transferred by conjugal mobilization from E. coli to P. putida, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Erwinia chrysanthemi, Paracoccus denitrificans or Rhizobium leguminosarum, the appropriate interposon drug resistance is usually expressed and, compared to the non-mutated plasmid, much reduced levels of C23O activity are detected. Thus, the selection and/or characterization of omega insertional mutations can be carried out in these bacterial species.
TI  - Oxygen tolerance of strictly aerobic hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria.
AB  - Growth of various bacteria, especially aerobic hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria, in the presence of 2 to 100% (v/v) oxygen in the gas atmosphere was evaluated. The bacterial strains included Alcaligenes eutrophus, A. paradoxus, Aquaspirillum autotrophicum, Arthrobacter spec. strain 11 X, Escherichia coli, Arthrobacter globiformis, Nocardia opaca, N. autotrophica, Paracoccus denitrificans, Pseudomonas facilis, P. putida, and Xanthobacter autotrophicus. Under heterotrophic conditions with fructose or gluconate as substrates neither colony formation on solid medium nor the growth rates in liquid media were drastically impaired by up to 100% oxygen. In contrast, autotrophic growth--with hydrogen, carbon dioxide and up to 80% oxygen in the gas atmosphere--was strongly depressed by high oxygen concentrations. However, only the growth rate, not the viability of the cells, was decreased. Growth retardation was accompanied by a decrease of hydrogenase activity.
TI  - Inhibition, but not uncoupling, of respiratory energy coupling of three bacterial species by nitrite.
AB  - The effect of nitrite on respiratory energy coupling of three bacteria was studied in light of a recent report that nitrite acted as an uncoupling agent with Paracoccus denitrificans grown under denitrifying conditions. Our determinations of proton translocation stoichiometry of Pseudomonas putida (aerobically grown), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and P. denitrificans (grown both aerobically and under denitrifying conditions) showed nitrite inhibition of proton-to-oxidant stoichiometry, but not uncoupling. Nitrite both reduced the H+/O ratio and decreased the rate of proton resorption. Increased proton resorption rates, characteristic of authentic uncoupling agents, were not observed. The lack of enhanced proton permeability due to nitrite was verified via passive proton permeability assays. The H+/O ratio of P. aeruginosa increased when growth conditions were changed from aerobic to denitrifying. This suggested the induction of an additional coupling site in the electron transport chain of denitrifying P. aeruginosa.
