TI  - [Recurrent meningitis due to anatomical defects: The bacteria indicates its origin].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recurrent meningitis is a rare disease. Anatomical abnormalities and immunodeficiency states are predisposing factors. Four cases, in which immunodeficiency was excluded, are presented. The causal microorganism led to the detection of the anatomical defect responsible for the recurrences. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of 4 cases with clinical diagnosis of recurrent bacterial meningitis. RESULTS: Case 1: a thirty month-old boy with unilateral hearing loss, diagnosed with Mondini abnormality by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after 2 episodes of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis. Surgical repair after third recurrence. Case 2: fourteen year-old girl diagnosed by MRI with cribriform plate defect after 3 episodes of meningitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed. Case 3: girl with meningitis due to Staphylococcus aureus at 2 and 7 months. MRI shows occipital dermal sinus requiring excision. Complication with cerebellar abscesses because of a coexisting dermoid cyst. Case 4: child with meningitis due to Streptococcus bovis at 9 days and Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli at 7 months, with positive cultures to Citrobacter freundii and E. faecium later on. Spinal MRI led to the diagnosis of Currarino syndrome with CSF fistula, which was surgically repaired. The 4 patients had undergone image studies reported as normal during the first episodes. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with recurrent meningitis the possibility of an anatomical defect should be considered. The isolated microorganism should help to locate it. It is essential to know the normal flora of the different anatomical sites. The definitive treatment is usually surgical.
TI  - Ceftobiprole activity against over 60,000 clinical bacterial pathogens isolated in Europe, Turkey, and Israel from 2005 to 2010.
AB  - Ceftobiprole medocaril is a newly approved drug in Europe for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) (excluding patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia but including ventilated HAP patients) and community-acquired pneumonia in adults. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of ceftobiprole against prevalent Gram-positive and -negative pathogens isolated in Europe, Turkey, and Israel during 2005 through 2010. A total of 60,084 consecutive, nonduplicate isolates from a wide variety of infections were collected from 33 medical centers. Species identification was confirmed, and all isolates were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. Ceftobiprole had high activity against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (100.0% susceptible), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (99.3% susceptible), with MIC90 values of 0.25, 0.12, </= 0.06, and 0.5 mug/ml, respectively. Ceftobiprole was active against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (98.3% susceptible) and methicillin-resistant CoNS, having a MIC90 of 2 mug/ml. Ceftobiprole was active against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC50/90, 0.5/4 mug/ml) but not against most Enterococcus faecium isolates. Ceftobiprole was very potent against the majority of Enterobacteriaceae (87.3% susceptible), with >80% inhibited at </= 0.12 mug/ml. The potency of ceftobiprole against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC50/90, 2/>8 mug/ml; 64.6% at MIC values of </= 4 mug/ml) was similar to that of ceftazidime (MIC50/90, 2/>16 mug/ml; 75.4% susceptible), but limited activity was observed against Acinetobacter spp. and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. High activity was also observed against all Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, </= 0.06 mug/ml) and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC50/90, </= 0.06/0.25 mug/ml) isolates. Ceftobiprole demonstrated a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity against this very large longitudinal sample of contemporary pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the pleuromutilin antibiotic BC-3781 against bacterial  pathogens isolated in the SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program in 2010.
AB  - BC-3781 is a novel semisynthetic pleuromutilin antibiotic inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. BC-3781 has completed a phase 2 clinical trial in acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI). Its antibacterial spectrum additionally covers the predominant pathogens causing community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). In this study, the antibacterial activity of BC-3781 was evaluated against a contemporary collection of 10,035 bacterial isolates predominately causing ABSSSI and CABP, among other infections, collected within the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program worldwide in 2010. BC-3781 exhibited potent activity against organisms commonly isolated from ABSSSI such as Staphylococcus aureus (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.12 mug/ml; 99.8% inhibited at </=0.5 mug/ml), beta-hemolytic streptococci (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.03 mug/ml; 99.3% inhibited at </=0.5 mug/ml), and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; MIC50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/ml; 97.8% inhibited at </=1 mug/ml). BC-3781 displayed similar MIC distributions among methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant (MRSA) S. aureus strains. BC-3781 was also active against Enterococcus faecium, with 76.3% of vancomycin-susceptible and 97.0% of vancomycin-resistant isolates being inhibited at BC-3781 concentrations of </=1 mug/ml. Beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci were highly susceptible to BC-3781, with 99.3% and 96.7% of isolates inhibited at </=0.5 mug/ml, respectively. Further, activity of BC-3781 against Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC50/90, 1/2 mug/ml), and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml) was not negatively influenced by beta-lactamase production or resistance to other antimicrobial classes tested. In all, BC-3781 displayed a very potent antibacterial profile including the most prevalent bacterial pathogens causing ABSSSI and CABP, thus warranting further clinical development of this antibiotic in these and possibly other indications.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,866 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2010].
AB  - Postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (LVFX) has been conducted continuously since 1992. The present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in Japan to 30 selected antibacterial agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (FQs). The common respiratory pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to FQs. In contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among S pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Regarding H. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). Enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to FQs, however, prevalence of LVFX-resistant Escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. Nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of LVFX-resistant E. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence of LVFX 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. Another Enterobacteriaceae member, Klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to FQs, in contrast with E. coli. In methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the percentage of FQ-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other FQs. However, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates were highly susceptible to FQs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. The prevalence of FQs-resistant isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of FQ-resistance in MRSA. The prevalence of FQs-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (UTIs) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in P. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (RTIs). While this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were noted in the prevalence of FQ-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates derived from UTIs. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from UTIs and 0.3% among isolates from RTIs, a decrease from the results of 2007. Acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to FQs. Imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). Neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance of 81.3-82.5%, to FQs. Ceftriaxone (CTRX) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to CTRX in some clinical isolates. The result of the present survey indicated that although methicillin-resistant staphylococci, Enterococcus faecium, P. aeruginosa from UTIs, N. gonorrhoeae, and E. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the FQs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. While FQ resistance has been prevailing in E. coli, E. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to FQs. The other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against FQs.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of ceftobiprole against clinical isolates from French teaching hospitals: proposition of zone diameter breakpoints.
AB  - The aims of this study were to determine the in vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, a pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, against a large number of bacterial pathogens and to propose zone diameter breakpoints for clinical categorisation according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints. MICs of ceftobiprole were determined by broth microdilution against 1548 clinical isolates collected in eight French hospitals. Disk diffusion testing was performed using 30 mug disks according to the method of the Comite de l'Antibiogramme de la Societe Francaise de Microbiologie (CA-SFM). The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole, expressed by MIC(50/90) (MICs for 50% and 90% of the organisms, respectively) (mg/L), was as follows: meticillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 0.25/0.5; meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 1/2; meticillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), 0.12/0.5; meticillin-resistant CoNS, 1/2; penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, </= 0.008/0.03; penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, 0.12/0.5; viridans group streptococci, 0.03/0.12; beta-haemolytic streptococci, </= 0.008/0.016; Enterococcus faecalis, 0.25/1; Enterococcus faecium, 64/128; Enterobacteriaceae, 0.06/32; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4/16; Acinetobacter baumannii, 0.5/64; Haemophilus influenzae, 0.03/0.12; and Moraxella catarrhalis, 0.25/0.5. According to the regression curve, zone diameter breakpoints could be 28, 26, 24 and 22 mm for MICs of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 mg/L respectively. In conclusion, this study confirms the potent in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against many Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA but not E. faecium, whilst maintaining a Gram-negative spectrum similar to the advanced-generation cephalosporins such as cefepime. Thus ceftobiprole appears to be well suited for the empirical treatment of a variety of healthcare-associated infections.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of doripenem against clinical isolates from French teaching hospitals: proposition of zone diameter breakpoints.
AB  - The aims of the study were to determine the in vitro activity of doripenem, a new carbapenem, against a large number of bacterial pathogens and to propose zone diameter breakpoints for clinical categorization in France according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints. The MICs of doripenem were determined by the broth microdilution method against 1,547 clinical isolates from eight French hospitals. The disk diffusion test was performed (10-mug discs) according to the Comite de l'Antibiogramme de la Societe Francaise de Microbiologie (CASFM) method. The MIC(50/90) (mg/L) values were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (0.03/0.25), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (1/2), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (MSCoNS) (0.03/0.12), methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS) (2/8), Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.016/0.25), viridans group streptococci (0.016/2), beta-hemolytic streptococci (</=0.008/</=0.008), Enterococcus faecalis (2/4), Enterococcus faecium (128/>128), Enterobacteriaceae (0.06/0.25), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.5/8), Acinetobacter baumannii (0.25/2), Haemophilus influenzae (0.12/0.25), and Moraxella catarrhalis (0.03/0.06). According to the regression curve, the zone diameter breakpoints were 24 and 19 mm for MICs of 1 and 4 mg/L, respectively. This study confirms the potent in vitro activity of doripenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Enterobacteriaceae, MSSA, MSCoNS, and respiratory pathogens. According to the EUCAST MIC breakpoints (mg/L) </=1/>4 for Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter, and </=1/>1 for streptococci, pneumococci, and Haemophilus, the zone diameter breakpoints could be (mm) >/=24/<19 and >/=24/<24, respectively.
TI  - NXL-103, a combination of flopristin and linopristin, for the potential treatment of bacterial infections including community-acquired pneumonia and MRSA.
AB  - Novexel is developing the novel, orally active, semisynthetic streptogramin NXL-103, which has potential therapeutic application in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, community- or hospital-acquired MRSA, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and acute bacterial skin and soft tissue infections. NXL-103 is a combination of streptogramin A:streptogramin B components, initially developed in a 70:30 dose ratio. In multiple in vitro studies, NXL-103 demonstrated potent activity against different types of bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. NXL-103 was not affected by the resistance profiles of bacteria against other commonly used antibiotics. In phase I clinical trials, NXL-103 achieved bactericidal levels in plasma and was generally well tolerated, with side effects primarily on the gastrointestinal system. The first phase II trial conducted to evaluate the efficacy of NXL-103 against community-acquired pneumonia revealed that the compound was comparable with amoxicillin. NXL-103 has promise to become an important agent in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and complex skin and soft tissue infections, pending further development.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms: tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial 2004 to 2007.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial began in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Against Gram negatives (n = 63 699), tigecycline MIC(90)'s ranged from 0.25 to 2 mg/L for Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens (but was > or =32 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Against Gram-positive organisms (n = 32 218), tigecycline MIC(90)'s were between 0.06 and 0.25 mg/L for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. The in vitro activity of tigecycline was maintained against resistant phenotypes, including multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (9.2% of isolates), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (7.0%) and K. pneumoniae (14.0%), beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae (22.2%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (44.5%), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (45.9%) and E. faecalis (2.8%), and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (13.8%). Tigecycline represents a welcome addition to the armamentarium against difficult to treat organisms.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo properties of dihydrophthalazine antifolates, a novel family of antibacterial drugs.
AB  - Racemic 2,4-diaminopyrimidine dihydrophthalazine derivatives BAL0030543, BAL0030544, and BAL0030545 exhibited low in vitro MICs toward small, selected panels of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Mycobacterium avium, though the compounds were less active against Haemophilus influenzae. The constellation of dihydrofolate reductases (DHFRs) present in 20 enterococci and 40 staphylococci was analyzed and correlated with the antibacterial activities of the dihydrophthalazines and trimethoprim. DHFRs encoded by dfrB, dfrA (S1 isozyme), dfrE, and folA were susceptible to the dihydrophthalazines, whereas DHFRs encoded by dfrG (S3 isozyme) and dfrF were not. Studies with the separated enantiomers of BAL0030543, BAL0030544, and BAL0030545 revealed preferential inhibition of susceptible DHFRs by the (R)-enantiomers. BAL0030543, BAL0030544, and BAL0030545 were well tolerated by mice during 5- and 10-day oral toxicity studies at doses of up to 400 mg/kg of body weight. Using a nonoptimized formulation, the dihydrophthalazines displayed acceptable oral bioavailabilities in mice, and efficacy studies with a septicemia model of mice infected with trimethoprim-resistant, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus gave 50% effective dose values in the range of 1.6 to 6.25 mg/kg.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline (PPI-0903M, T-91825) against bacteria with defined resistance mechanisms and phenotypes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ceftaroline (PPI-0903M, T-91825) is a novel cephalosporin, administered as an N-phosphono prodrug. We investigated its in vitro activity and resistance selection potential. METHODS: MICs were determined by CLSI agar dilution, but with varied inocula. Mutant selection was investigated in single- and multi-step procedures. RESULTS: MICs for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were 0.5-2 mg/L, compared with 0.12-0.25 mg/L for methicillin-susceptible S. aureus; corresponding values for coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.25-2 and 0.06-0.12 mg/L, respectively. Even with 2% NaCl added, all MRSA were susceptible at 2 mg/L. MICs for Enterococcus faecalis were from 0.25 to 8 mg/L; E. faecium was resistant. MICs for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Morganella morganii and Proteeae without acquired resistance were 0.06-0.5 mg/L versus 0.12-1 mg/L for Enterobacter, Serratia and Citrobacter spp. and 2-8 mg/L for Acinetobacter spp. MICs rose to 1-2 mg/L for many Enterobacteriaceae with classical TEM beta-lactamases, and were much higher for those with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), hyperproduced AmpC or K1 enzymes. MICs for strains with classical TEM/SHV beta-lactamases rose if the inoculum was increased to 10(6) cfu/spot; this effect was even more marked for those with ESBLs. Resistance due to Class A beta-lactamases was reversed by clavulanate. Geometric mean MICs were 0.005, 0.05 and 0.09 mg/L for penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, respectively-lower than for any comparator beta-lactam. Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were very susceptible, although with marginally raised MICs for beta-lactamase-positive Moraxella strains and for haemophili with chromosomal ampicillin resistance. Ceftaroline selected AmpC-derepressed Enterobacter mutants similarly to cefotaxime in single-step experiments; in multi-step procedures it selected ESBL variants of blaTEM in E. coli. Resistance selection was not seen with S. aureus, H. influenzae or pneumococci. CONCLUSIONS: Ceftaroline has impressive anti-MRSA and anti-pneumococcal activity. Slight lability to classical TEM and SHV beta-lactamases is exceptional for an oxyimino-cephalosporin, but was reversible with clavulanate, as was the greater resistance mediated by ESBLs. Resistance selection occurred with Enterobacteriaceae, not MRSA.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - [Etiology of pulmonary diseases in children in Khabarovsk Region].
AB  - Microflora of upper respiratory tract in 658 children aged 1 month - 17 years hospitalized with acute pneumonia (AP), acute bronchitis (AB), recurrent obstructive bronchitis (ROB), malformation of lungs (ML) and broncho-alveolar dysplasia (BALD) were studied. Carriage rates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (up to 95%) and Haemophilus influenzae (up to 89%) in 240 children attending daycare centers and schools were determined. Etiology of infectious process was ascertained in 40% of cases. S. pneumoniae was isolated in 45% of acute cases (AP and AB) and in 25% of chronic cases (BALD). H. influenzae was isolated in 8 - 12% of acute cases and in 32% of chronic cases. In 23 - 29% of all cases of pulmonary pathology in children persistence of Enterococcus faecium was determined. There were 13 different serotypes among isolated pneumococci. In patients with pneumonia the rate of detection of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae DNA fragments by PCR was significantly higher compared with rate of their isolation from sputum.
TI  - [Antimicrobial resistance surveillance: VIRA STUDY 2006].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to determine the current antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the most frequent multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the two VIRA studies carried out in 2001 and 2004. METHODS: In February 2006, the 40 participating hospitals sent the following microorganisms: non-penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (92), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (290), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (136), ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (89), ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae (67), ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli (365), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (181), and Acinetobacter baumannii (92). The hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. Susceptibility was determined with a broth microdilution method. RESULTS: Among the non-penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae isolates, the proportion of those ones resistant to this antibiotic showed a significant (p < 0.001) decrease (59.8% in 2001, 30.2% in 2004 and 14.3% in 2006). Among MRSA, we detected one isolate nonsusceptible to linezolid, four resistant to quinupristin-dalfopristin and one strain with a vancomycin MIC of 4 microg/mL. The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli was 12.1%. Resistance of A. baumannii to imipenem varied from 27% in the 2001-2004 period to 47.8% in 2006 (p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: These results again emphasize that resistance surveillance systems are an important tool for preventing the emergence and spread of multi-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Performance accuracy of antibacterial and antifungal susceptibility test methods: report from the College of American Pathologists Microbiology Surveys Program (2001-2003).
AB  - CONTEXT: The College of American Pathologists Microbiology Surveys Program provides external proficiency samples that monitor the performance of nearly 3000 laboratories that perform and report antimicrobial susceptibility tests. OBJECTIVE: To summarize results obtained with bacterial and yeast challenge samples (2001 through 2003). DESIGN: One organism every 4 months was tested by surveys participants against antibacterials/antifungals by routinely used methods. Reports were graded by interpretive category (susceptible, intermediate, resistant) based on an 80% consensus of referees/participants. RESULTS: The most common antibacterial test methods/systems were Vitek (38%-43%), MicroScan (39%-43%), and the disk diffusion test (14%-15%), although Etest was most used for fastidious species. YeastOne was the dominant antifungal test (50%-55%). Antifungal results demonstrated continuous, improved accuracy (83%-88%), highest for YeastOne (96%) and broth microdilution (95%) methods. Antibacterial test accuracy was consistently greater than 97% against gram-positive organism challenges and greater than 98% against gram-negative challenges. For gram-negative strains with well-characterized resistance mechanisms, the accuracy by method was disk diffusion greater than broth microdilution greater than automated systems. Major problems identified were (1) Haemophilus influenzae control ranges require re-evaluation, (2) overuse of beta-lactamase tests, (3) errors among Enterococcus faecium against penicillins (Vitek 2, MicroScan), (4) false-susceptible results with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole against coagulase-negative staphylococci (MicroScan), (5) macrolide false-susceptibility for beta-hemolytic streptococcus (MicroScan), (6) flawed reporting for antimicrobials not active at the infection site, (7) use of outdated interpretive criteria, and (8) failure to follow Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute testing/reporting recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Susceptibility tests were generally performing satisfactorily as measured by the surveys, but serious errors were identified with some drug/organism combinations that may require action by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute and/or the Food and Drug Administration.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a novel peptide deformylase inhibitor, LBM415, tested against respiratory tract and cutaneous infection pathogens: a global surveillance report (2003-2004).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the spectrum of activity and potency of LBM415, the first of the peptide deformylase inhibitor (PDFI) class to be developed for treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections and uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections (uSSTI), against a large, contemporary international collection of targeted pathogens collected during 2003-2004. METHODS: A total of 21,636 isolates were tested by reference broth microdilution methods as part of a longitudinal international antimicrobial resistance surveillance study. Characteristics of the organism collection included resistance to oxacillin among 35.0% of Staphylococcus aureus and 76.0% of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS); resistance to penicillin (MIC > or = 2 mg/L) among 18.0% of Streptococcus pneumoniae; vancomycin resistance among 20.0% of Enterococcus spp. and ampicillin resistance among 22.0% of Haemophilus influenzae. RESULTS: LBM415 displayed potent activity against staphylococci, streptococci, Enterococcus faecium and Moraxella catarrhalis, with > or = 99.0% of strains being inhibited at < or = 4 mg/L; 97.0% of Enterococcus faecalis isolates and 92.0% of H. influenzae isolates were also inhibited at this concentration. Seventy-seven percent of Burkholderia cepacia and 82.0% of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were inhibited at < or = 8 mg/L. No differences in LBM415 activity against S. aureus, CoNS, S. pneumoniae, Enterococcus spp. and H. influenzae were detected for subsets susceptible or resistant to antimicrobials such as oxacillin, penicillin, ampicillin, macrolides, vancomycin and fluoroquinolones. While regional differences were apparent with some comparator agents, sensitivity to LBM415 did not vary significantly among strains from the various geographic areas sampled. One isolate of S. aureus displayed high-level resistance to LBM415 owing to multiple sequence changes in resistance phenotype genes (defB and fmt), despite the absence of the compound in clinical practice. This isolate remained susceptible to all other antimicrobials tested except for penicillin. CONCLUSIONS: With few differences detected among strains from various geographic regions, the first PDFI class agent to enter clinical development has consistently demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against commonly isolated pathogens associated with uncomplicated respiratory and cutaneous infections. These compounds represent a significant therapeutic advance owing to their novel mechanism of action and antibacterial spectrum, including activity against resistant organisms, should pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters support their continued development. Given the detection of a pre-existing PDFI-resistant isolate of S. aureus as demonstrated here, surveillance for resistance among the PDFI-targeted pathogens following introduction of this class of agent into clinical usage will be an important component of future studies.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of doripenem (S-4661): a global surveillance report (2003).
AB  - The spectrum of activity and potency of doripenem, a broad-spectrum parenteral carbapenem currently in clinical development, was evaluated using 16 008 clinical bacterial isolates collected as part of an international surveillance project during 2003. Using reference broth microdilution methods, doripenem was found to be highly active against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (2705 and 297 isolates, respectively; MIC90s 0.06 mg/L), with a potency greater than that of other carbapenem antibiotics. Against enterococci (1474 isolates), with the exception of Enterococcus faecium, doripenem displayed modest activity (MIC50 4). Doripenem was among the most potent agents tested against Streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci and beta-haemolytic streptococci (885, 140 and 397 isolates; MIC(90)s 0.5, 0.5 and 0.03 mg/L, respectively). For Enterobacteriaceae (> 6200 isolates), doripenem was four- to 32-fold more active than imipenem against wild-type isolates (MIC90s 0.03-0.5 mg/L). MIC90s for confirmed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (121 and 155 isolates; 0.06 and 0.12 mg/L, respectively) were two-fold higher than for wild-type isolates. Doripenem was also active against Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp. and Serratia spp. (MIC90s 0.06-0.25 mg/L), including ceftazidime-resistant isolates. Doripenem and meropenem were the most active agents among all beta-lactams against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (829 isolates; MIC50/90s 0.5/8 and 0.5/16 mg/L, respectively), whereas doripenem and imipenem were the most active agents against Acinetobacter spp. (155 isolates; MIC50/90s 0.5/4 and <or= 0.5/2 mg/L, respectively). Doripenem was slightly more potent (MIC50 2 mg/L) than ertapenem and imipenem (MIC50 4 mg/L), and had a potency similar to that of meropenem (MIC50 2 mg/L), against Burkholderia cepacia (20 isolates). Both Haemophilus influenzae (1824 isolates) and Moraxella catarrhalis (108 isolates), including beta-lactamase-positive isolates, were susceptible to doripenem (MIC90s 0.25 and 0.03 mg/L, respectively). Doripenem displays the favourable characteristics of other carbapenems, and appears to offer certain advantages in terms of potency, spectrum and beta-lactamase stability when compared with some carbapenems used currently to treat nosocomial infections.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of SM-216601, a new broad-spectrum  parenteral carbapenem.
AB  - SM-216601 is a novel parenteral 1beta-methylcarbapenem. In agar dilution susceptibility testing, the MIC of SM-216601 for 90% of the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains tested (MIC(90)) was 2 microg/ml, which was comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid. SM-216601 was also very potent against Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant strains (MIC(90) = 8 microg/ml). SM-216601 exhibited potent activity against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, with MIC(90)s of less than 0.5 microg/ml, and intermediate activity against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The therapeutic efficacy of SM-216601 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by S. aureus, E. faecium, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa reflected its in vitro activity and plasma level. Thus, SM-216601 is a promising candidate for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against 6792 Gram-negative and Gram-positive clinical isolates from the global Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST Program, 2004).
AB  - Tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antibiotic, has shown promising in vitro activity against many common pathogens, including multidrug-resistant strains. To determine the activity of tigecycline against a broad range of pathogens from diverse populations and geographic areas, the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST Program) commenced in 2003. This study evaluated the activity of tigecycline and commonly used antimicrobials against 6792 clinical isolates from 40 study centers in 11 countries. Tigecycline was the most active agent tested against Gram-positive facultative species including multidrug-resistant strains. MIC90 results (microg/mL) for tigecycline against Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.12, 0.12, 0.25, and 0.25 microg/mL, respectively. Tigecycline was active against Enterobacteriaceae with an MIC90 of 1 microg/mL. Haemophilus influenzae was very susceptible to tigecycline with an MIC90 of only 0.25 microg/mL. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the least susceptible organism tested against tigecycline. Tigecycline appears to be a promising new glycylcycline agent for the treatment of many types of pathogens with varying resistance phenotypes.
TI  - In vitro activities of tigecycline against clinical isolates from Shanghai, China.
AB  - To evaluate the in vitro activity of tigecycline, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of tigecycline against 1,201 strains of recent clinical isolates from 10 hospitals in Shanghai, China were determined and compared with selected comparators. Results showed that tigecycline had broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. It was highly active against Gram-positive cocci, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp., penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. Tigecycline also had good activity against most strains of Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. However, it was poorly active against Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Tigecycline was highly active against anaerobic Gram-positive cocci such as Peptococcus spp. The in vitro activity of tigecycline was significantly better than that of minocycline and tetracycline. It was as active as or slightly more active than vancomycin and teicoplanin in the activity against resistant aerobic Gram-positive cocci. Tigecycline was bactericidal against all Gram-positive cocci tested except Enterococcus spp. Inoculum size but not pH of medium or concentration of human serum in broth had significant effect on the in vitro activity of tigecycline. Aged media (48-72 hours after preparation) used in the test and specific resistance problem in China may have some effects on MIC values of tigecycline.
TI  - [Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance: VIRA study 2004].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of the study was to know the current situation of the antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of the main multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the VIRA study carried out in 2001. METHODS: The 40 participating hospitals sent a total of 1,425 microorganisms isolated in February 2004, distributed as follows: penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (139), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (289), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (158), ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (89) and Enterococcus faecalis (2), ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae (85), ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli (346), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (187), and Acinetobacter baumannii (130). The hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. Sensitivity was determined by the broth microdilution method. RESULTS: The number of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci fell significantly (p < 0.0001) compared with the previous study (from 59.8% to 30.2%). Global methicillin-resistance in S. aureus was 31.2%, which represents a significant increase (p < 0.001) compared with the year 2001 (24.8%). 11.3% of the E. coli strains were extended-spectrum beta -lactamase-producers and came from 24 hospitals. One P. aeruginosa isolate gave a positive result in the E-test MBL assay, suggesting the presence of metallo-beta -lactamases. The strains of imipenem-resistant A. baumannii presented cross-resistance with several antibiotics. CONCLUSION: These results show how the multi-resistant bacteria included in the study represent a growing problem in our hospitals. This emphasizes the importance of resistance surveillance systems and the correct use of antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Doripenem (S-4661), a novel carbapenem: comparative activity against contemporary pathogens including bactericidal action and preliminary in vitro methods evaluations.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the potency of doripenem, a broad-spectrum carbapenem  characterized by a wider spectrum of activity combining antimicrobial and bactericidal features of imipenem and meropenem. METHODS: This parenteral compound was studied against recent clinical isolates (2001-2002) from a worldwide organism collection. A total of 902 strains were susceptibility tested by reference methods against doripenem and six to 28 comparators including ertapenem, imipenem and meropenem. The organisms tested included: Enterobacteriaceae (281 strains), Acinetobacter spp. (33), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (35), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (36), other non-fermenters (22), Haemophilus influenzae (61), Moraxella catarrhalis (33), oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci (39), enterococci (84), streptococci (163), various anaerobes (98), and other Gram-positive species such as Corynebacterium and Bacillus spp. (17). RESULTS: Against Enterobacteriaceae, the average doripenem MIC90 was 0.03 mg/L (range, < or =0.015-0.25 mg/L). Doripenem was two- to 16-fold more potent than imipenem and comparable to ertapenem and meropenem; all doripenem MIC values with enteric bacilli were < or =4 mg/L. Doripenem was active against Aeromonas (MIC50, 0.03 mg/L), Bacillus spp. (MIC50, 0.03 mg/L) and all tested anaerobic species (MIC range, < or =0.015-4 mg/L), but was less active against S. maltophilia (MIC90, >32 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecium (MIC90, >32 mg/L) among the enterococcal species. Time-dependent bactericidal action was observed for doripenem and broth MIC results were slightly greater when compared to agar MIC results. In pilot testing, the optimal doripenem disc concentration was 10 microg, identical to standardized reagents for other clinically available carbapenems. CONCLUSIONS: Doripenem appears to be a potent carbapenem with a spectrum resembling currently marketed antipseudomonal carbapenems, but with greater activity when tested against some non-fermentative bacillary strains. Continued evaluation of doripenem against isolates resistant to other beta-lactams appears to be warranted.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of three new quinolones and azithromycin against  aerobic pathogens causing respiratory tract and abdominal wound infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In our study the in vitro susceptibility of common pathogens that cause respiratory tract and abdominal wound infections was tested against two newer fluorquinolones (moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin) as well as levofloxacin and azithromycin. METHODS: 50 isolates each of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae isolated from the respiratory tract and from wounds were tested for their susceptibility to moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and azithromycin. RESULTS: Moxifloxacin proved to be the most active substance against the tested gram-positive pathogens. Gatifloxacin was the most active against P. aeruginosa. Moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin proved to be comparably active against the clinical isolates of E. coli and H. influenzae. CONCLUSIONS: Moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin display excellent activity against respiratory pathogens as well as nosocomial pathogens causing abdominal wound infections. When treating infections caused by P. aeruginosa the earlier fluorquinolones such as ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin are the substances of choice.
TI  - Algorithm for the identification of bacterial pathogens in positive blood cultures by real-time LightCycler polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with sequence-specific probes.
AB  - We developed real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for rapid detection of the most common and clinically relevant bacteria in positive blood culture bottles, including Staphylococcus spp., S. epidermidis, S. aureus, Enterococcus spp. (including differentiation of E. faecalis and E. faecium), Streptococcus spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter spp., Bacteroides spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. A total of 507 positive blood cultures were investigated according to a specific PCR algorithm based on the microscopic result of the blood culture, and the PCR results were compared to the culture results. Apart from-cross reactions between E. coli and Chryseomonas luteola and Enterococcus faecium and E. durans, the PCR assay correctly identified all bacteria in the blood cultures and did not show any false-positive results. Regarding blood cultures positive with a single species of bacteria (n = 474), 98.3% of all bacteria were correctly detected by the PCR algorithm within a few hours. However, in mixed infections, the sensitivity was lower. The PCR algorithm is well suited for rapid identification of the most common bacteria in positive blood cultures.
TI  - Comparative study of the in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, ABT-492.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, ABT-492, was determined. METHODS: MICs were compared with those of two beta-lactams, telithromycin, ciprofloxacin and four later generation fluoroquinolones. The effects of human serum and of inoculum concentration were also investigated. RESULTS: MIC data indicate that ABT-492 has potent activity against Gram-positive organisms with enhanced anti-staphylococcal activity compared with earlier fluoroquinolones, in addition to activity against beta-haemolytic streptococci, pneumococci including penicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant Enterococcus faecalis but not Enterococcus faecium. ABT-492 was the most active agent tested against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria meningitidis, fluoroquinolone-susceptible Neisseria gonorrhoeae and anaerobes. Good activity was observed for ABT-492 amongst the Enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes tested, but ciprofloxacin showed superior activity for species of Proteus, Morganella and Providencia, as well as for Pseudomonas spp. In common with the other fluoroquinolones tested, organisms with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin had raised MIC(90)s to ABT-492. The one isolate of H. influenzae tested with reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility had an ABT-492 MIC close to that of the population lacking a mechanism of quinolone resistance. ABT-492 was more active than ciprofloxacin against Chlamydia spp. An inoculum effect was observed with a number of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, E. faecium, Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli, in addition to moderately raised MICs in the presence of 70% serum protein. The clinical significance of these findings is yet to be determined. CONCLUSIONS: ABT-492 is a new fluoroquinolone with excellent activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, with many potential clinical uses.
TI  - Increasing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Korea: KONSAR study in 2001.
AB  - The 5th year KONSAR surveillance in 2001 was based on routine test data at 30 participating hospitals. It was of particular interest to find a trend in the resistances of enterococci to vancomycin, of Enterobacteriaceae to the 3rd generation cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone, and of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacters to carbapenem. Resistance rates of Gram-positive cocci were: 70% of Staphylococcus aureus to oxacillin; 88% and 16% of Enterococcus faecium to ampicillin and vancomycin, respectively. Seventy-two percent of pneumococci were nonsusceptible to penicillin. The resistance rates of Enterobacteriaceae were: Escherichia coli, 28% to fluoroquinolone; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 27% to ceftazidime, and 20% to cefoxitin; and Enterobacter cloacae, > or =40% to cefotaxime and ceftazidime. The resistance rates of P. aeruginosa were 21% to ceftazidime, 17% to imipenem, and those of the acinetobacters were > or =61% to ceftazidime, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolone and cotrimoxazole. Thirty-five percent of non-typhoidal salmonellae were ampicillin resistant, and 66% of Haemophilus influenzae were beta-lactamase producers. Notable changes over the 1997-2001 period were: increases in vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, and amikacin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant acinetobacters. With the increasing prevalence of resistant bacteria, nationwide surveillance has become more important for optimal patient management, for the control of nosocomial infection, and for the conservation of the newer antimicrobial agents.
TI  - In vitro activity of ABT773, a new ketolide derivative exhibiting innovative microbiological properties against well-characterised antibiotic resistant pathogens in Italy.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ABT773, a new ketolide, was assessed against a collection (518) of well-characterised Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens and compared with that of other appropriate drugs. ABT773 was active (MIC-90=0.03 mg/l) against the staphylococci tested which included macrolide-resistant but clindamycin susceptible organisms. Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae were also inhibited (MIC-90 range: <0.0075-0.5mg/l) irrespective of their antibiotic resistance phenotype. Enterococcus faecalis was sensitive to ABT773 with the exception of VanA mutants. E. faecium showed poor susceptibility to ABT773. The activity of the new ketolide against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis was comparable with that of the most potent drugs tested. ABT773 displays the characteristics of a promising agent that deserves to be introduced as the empirical therapy of infections caused by the bacterial species tested here, even if they are multiply resistant.
TI  - In vitro activities of the novel cephalosporin LB 11058 against multidrug-resistant Staphylococci and Streptococci.
AB  - LB 11058 is a novel parenteral cephalosporin with a C-3 pyrimidinyl-substituted vinyl sulfide group and a C-7 2-amino-5-chloro-1,3-thiazole group. This study evaluated the in vitro activity and spectrum of LB 11058 against 1,245 recent clinical isolates, including a subset of gram-positive strains with specific resistant phenotypes. LB 11058 was very active against Streptococcus pneumoniae. The novel cephalosporin was 8- to 16-fold more potent than ceftriaxone, cefepime, or amoxicillin-clavulanate against both penicillin-intermediate and -resistant S. pneumoniae. LB 11058 was also very active against both beta-hemolytic streptococci (MIC at which 90% of isolates were inhibited [MIC(90)], </=0.008 micro g/ml) and viridans group streptococci (MIC(90), 0.03 to 0.5 micro g/ml), including penicillin-resistant strains. Among oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, LB 11058 MIC results varied from 0.06 to 0.25 micro g/ml (MIC(50), 0.12 micro g/ml), while among oxacillin-resistant strains LB 11058 MICs varied from 0.25 to 1 micro g/ml (MIC(50), 1 micro g/ml). Coagulase-negative staphylococci showed an LB 11058 susceptibility pattern similar to that of S. aureus, with all isolates being inhibited at </=1 micro g/ml. LB 11058 also showed reasonable in vitro activity against Enterococcus faecalis, including vancomycin-resistant strains (MIC(50), 1 micro g/ml), and Bacillus spp. (MIC(50), 0.25 micro g/ml); however, it was less active against Enterococcus faecium (MIC(50), >64 micro g/ml) and Corynebacterium spp. (MIC(50), 32 micro g/ml). Against gram-negative pathogens, LB 11058 showed activity against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC(90), 0.25 to 0.5 micro g/ml) and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC(90), 0.25 micro g/ml), with MICs not influenced by beta-lactamase production. In conclusion, LB 11058 demonstrated a broad antibacterial spectrum and was highly active against gram-positive bacteria, particularly against multidrug-resistant staphylococci and streptococci.
TI  - [Activities of antimicrobial agents against 8,474 clinical isolates obtained from 37 medical institutions during 2000 in Japan].
AB  - A survey was conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial agents against 8,474 clinical isolates obtained from 37 Japanese medical institutions in 2000. A total of 25 antimicrobial agents were used, comprising 4 fluoroquinolones, 13 beta-lactams, minocycline, chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, azithromycin, gentamicin, amikacin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and vancomycin. A high resistance rate of over 85% against fluoroquinolones was exhibited by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecium. Isolates showing resistance to fluoroquinolones among methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from UTI accounted for 30-60%. However, many of the common pathogens were still susceptible to fluoroquinolones, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Moraxella catarrhalis, the Enterobacteriaceae family, and Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant isolates). About 85% of P. aeruginosa isolated from RTI were susceptible to fluoroquinolones. In conclusion, this survey of sensitivity to antimicrobial agents clearly indicated trend for increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones among MRSA, Enterococci, and P. aeruginosa isolated from UTI, although fluoroquinolones are still effective against other organisms and P. aeruginosa from RTI as has been demonstrated in previous studies.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of novel 2-(thiazol-2-ylthio)-1beta-methylcarbapenems with potent activities against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - SM-197436, SM-232721, and SM-232724 are new 1beta-methylcarbapenems with a unique 4-substituted thiazol-2-ylthio moiety at the C-2 side chain. In agar dilution susceptibility testing these novel carbapenems were active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) with a MIC(90) of </=4 micro g/ml. Furthermore, SM-232724 showed strong bactericidal activity against MRSA, in contrast to linezolid, which was bacteriostatic up to four times the MIC. SM-232724 showed good therapeutic efficacy comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid against systemic infections of MRSA in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. The MICs of SM-197436, SM-232721, and SM-232724 for streptococci, including penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, ranged from </=0.063 to 0.5 micro g/ml. These drugs were the most active beta-lactams tested against Enterococcus faecium, and the MIC(90) s for ampicillin-resistant E. faecium ranged between 8 and 16 micro g/ml, which were slightly higher than the value for linezolid. However, time-kill assays revealed the superior bactericidal activity of SM-232724 compared to those of quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid against an E. faecium strain with a 4-log reduction in CFU at four times the MIC after 24 h of exposure to antibiotics. In addition, SM-232724 significantly reduced the numbers of bacteria in a murine abscess model with the E. faecium strain: its efficacy was superior to that of linezolid, although the MICs (2 micro g/ml) of these two agents are the same. Among gram-negative bacteria, these three carbapenems were highly active against Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), Moraxella catarrhalis, and Bacteroides fragilis, and showed antibacterial activity equivalent to that of imipenem for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus spp. Thus, these new carbapenems are promising candidates for agents to treat nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, especially multiresistant gram-positive cocci, including MRSA and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase productivity of recent clinical  isolates during the period between December 1999 and February 2000].
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility testings of 24 antimicrobial agents against 605 clinical strains belonging to 10 species were carried out according to the micro-broth dilution method of NCCLS M7-A4. The productivity of beta-lactamase was also determined against them isolated at 8 medical facilities in Nagano prefecture, Japan during the period between December 1999 and February 2000. When applied the nitrocefin method, beta-lactamase productivity was demonstrated to be positive for 89.2% of 74 S. aureus, 4.3% of 94 H. influenzae, and 100% of 69 M. (B.) catarrhalis isolates. On the other hand, when used the acidometry method, penicillinase/cephalosporinase were found to be positive for 21.2%/9.6% of 52 E. coli, 29.0%/3.2% of 31 K. pneumoniae, 53.2%/100% of 47 E. cloacae, 0%/11.1% of 99 S. marcescens, and 25.9%/55.6% of 54 P. aeruginosa isolates, respectively. Among the beta-lactamase-producers including P. aeruginosa isolates, only 2 E. coli isolates were found to be ESBL-producers. Besides, 9.6% (9/94) of H. influenzae isolates were proved to be BLNAR strains.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and prevalence of beta-lactamase producing clinical isolates in southern Kyushu. The results of collaborative study from 1999 to 2000].
AB  - The positivity of beta-lactamase and antimicrobial susceptibility were determined in a total of 1,358 clinical isolates at 15 hospitals and clinics in four prefectures in southern Kyushu (Okinawa, Miyazaki, Kagoshima and Kumamoto) during the period from December 1999 to February 2000. The isolates collected comprised of 176 strains of S. aureus, 203 of H. influenzae, 102 of M. catarrhalis, 206 of E. coli, 153 of K. pneumoniae, 99 of E. cloacae, 95 of S. marcescens, 201 of P. aeruginosa, 79 of E. faecalis, and 44 of E. faecium. The frequency of CPDX resistance among E. coli in particular varied geographically, and was found to be higher in Kumamoto and Kagoshima. The strains of K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae resistant to common antimicrobial agents were particularly found in Kagoshima, and one strain of IPM-resistant E. cloacae was isolated in Miyazaki. Also, the geographical difference in the frequency of LVFX resistance among the isolates of E. cloacae was noted, the results indicating the higher prevalence in Okinawa and Kagoshima. Resistant isolates of P. aeruginosa were less common in Kagoshima, and four isolates of P. aeruginosa from Miyazaki were found to be resistant to CAZ and IPM. None of the isolates of S. aureus and Enterococcus spp. was resistant to VCM or TEIC at all. The isolates of E. faecalis resistant at high-level GM (500 micrograms/ml) and SM (1,000 micrograms/ml) were found in 27.8% and 22.8%, and those of E. faecium were 6.8% and 38.6%, respectively. Overall, the ratio of MRSA among S. aureus was 67.6%, and three isolates were resistant to ABK with no less than 8 micrograms/ml of MIC. The frequency of BLNAR (beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin resistant) among H. influenzae isolated in Okinawa was markedly higher (isolation ratio, 37.9%) when compared with other prefectures, and the isolates of BLPACR (beta-lactamase-positive, AMPC/CVA resistant) were found only in Okinawa with a ratio of 41.6%. A total of 18 strains of ESBL defined by the NCCLS criteria (M100-S11) were isolated, eight strains of K. pneumoniae and 10 strains of E. coli. Of 18 isolates of ESBL, 13 were from Kagoshima and the remaining five were from Kumamoto.
TI  - [Beta-lactamase activity and susceptibilities to antibiotics among some species of bacteria isolated from medical institution between December 1999 and February 2000].
AB  - We studied the beta-lactamase activity and susceptibilities to antibiotics in 604 strains among 10 species of bacteria isolated from 10 medical institutions in Tottori and Shimane Prefectures between December 1999 and February 2000. beta-Lactamase activity was measured by the nitrocefin test and penicillinase/cephalosporinase activities were measured by acidometry. beta-Lactamase activity was detected in 72.1% of S. aureus, 18.8% of H. influenzae, and 96.3% of M. catarrhalis. Penicillinase/cephalosporinase activities were detected in 17.8%/22.2% of E. coli, 9.7%/0.0% of K. pneumoniae, 18.6%/95.3% of E. cloacae, 12.7%/79.4% of S. marcescens, and 7.1%/31.8% of P. aeruginosa. Three of 72 strains (4.2%) of K. pneumoniae and 5 of 90 strains (5.6%) of E. coli were assessed as ESBL-producing bacteria using the NCCLS proposed screening method based on routine susceptibility testing results. BLNAR were detected in 13 of 69 strains (18.8%) of H. influenzae.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase producibility of bacteria clinically isolated during the period from December 1999 to February 2000].
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase producibility were tested in 848  clinical strains collected at 8 hospitals in Kanagawa prefecture during the period from December 1999 to February 2000. Positive rates of beta-lactamase used the nitrocefin method (Cefinase) were 21.9% of Staphylococcus aureus, 10.0% of Haemophilus influenzae, and 99.0% of Moraxella catarrhalis. Furthermore, on the acidometric method (P/Case test) penicillinase (PCase), cephalosporinase (CEPase), and both of PCase and CEPase were found to be positive in 19.0%, 16.0%, and 16.0% for Escherichia coli, 6.2/0/3.1% for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0/66.3/26.5% for Enterobacter cloacae, 2.8/57.7/15.5% for Serratia marcescens, and 4.0/15.0/22.0% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. Based on the assessment of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antibacterial agents among beta-lactamase producing strains, there were 5 strains (4 strains of K. pneumoniae and 1 strain of E. coli) that may be ESBLs producing bacteria out of a total of 466 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. During this process, 1 strain of class-B beta-lactamase-producing E. cloacae was isolated. MRSA were found in 79.2% of S. aureus, and BLNAR were found in 8.9% of H. influenzae.
TI  - [beta-lactamase-producing activity and antimicrobial susceptibility of major pathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical samples. Japan beta-lactamase Research Group].
AB  - beta-Lactamase production and susceptibility to an assortment of antimicrobial agents were examined in 9,483 strains of organisms isolated from clinical materials obtained from inpatients and outpatients at 104 institutions throughout Japan from December 1999 to February 2000. The organisms were Staphylococcus aureus, 1,369 strains, including 847 methicillin-resistant (MRSA) strains; Enterococcus faecalis, 735 strains; Enterococcus faecium, 302 strains; Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, 730 strains; Haemophilus influenzae, 1,142 strains; Escherichia coli, 1,276 strains; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1,058 strains; Enterobacter cloacae, 772 strains; Serratia marcescens, 847 strains; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1,252 strains. The 23 antimicrobial agents used were ampicillin, sulbactam/ampicillin, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin, oxacillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotiam, cefmetazole, cefoperazone, sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpodoxime, imipenem, gentamicin, arbekacin, clarithromycin, minocycline, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, teicoplanin, and levofloxacin. Antimicrobial agents appropriate for each organism were used. Among S. aureus strains, 61.9% were MRSA, and 62.3% were positive for beta-lactamase. Among the MRSA strains, none was resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin, and only 3% were resistant to arbekacin. There was no vancomycin resistance in the Enterococcus strains. Only 0.1% of E. faecalis strains were ampicillin-resistant. Among the M. catarrhalis strains, 97.5% produced beta-lactamase, while among the H. influenzae strains, 8.5% produced beta-lactamase and 14.5% were beta-lactamase-negative and ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR). Among the Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa strains, there were 20 (E. coli; 7/1,276, K. pneumoniae; 13/1,058) that produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), and 11 that produced class B beta-lactamases. Multiple drug resistance was advanced in every species, and organisms resistant to 7 or more common antimicrobial agents were isolated. The best combination of antimicrobial agent and beta-lactamase inhibitor was sulbactam/cefoperazone. Sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefepime, and imipenem still have excellent antimicrobial activity. Rates of resistance to each antimicrobial agent differed more among institutions than among geographical regions.
TI  - Evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  - The newly developed Rapid Lumi Eiken/IS60 (RL/IS60) system automatically determines MICs by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. The present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. Sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with MICs determined by the reference microdilution method. When the MICs of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (QC) strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the RL/IS60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the QC limits proposed by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The system was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, P. aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the RL/IS60 system and the reference microdilution method. Our results suggest that the RL/IS60 system provides rapid and reliable MICs of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as QC strains.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of BAL9141, a novel parenteral cephalosporin active against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  - Community-acquired and nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens continue to increase in prevalence and have become a serious problem in many parts of the world. BAL9141 is a member of the class of parenteral pyrrolidinone-3-ylidenemethyl cephalosporins, and has a broad spectrum of activity. In the current study, BAL9141 was tested against a large number (n = 2263) of recent isolates from various international surveillance programmes including 1097 Gram-positive strains. Susceptibility to (S) and activity of (mg/L) to BAL9141, based on proposed breakpoints (MIC50/MIC90/% S) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.5/0.5/100%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (1/2/100%), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (0.12/0.25/100%), methicillin-resistant CoNS (MR-CoNS) (1/2/100%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (< or = 0.015/0.25/100%), viridans group streptococci (0.03/0.5/99%), beta-haemolytic streptococci (< or = 0.015/< or = 0.015/100%), Enterococcus faecalis (0.5/16/90%), Enterococcus faecium (>32/>32/22%), Haemophilus influenzae (0.06/0.06/100%), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.06/0.5/100%), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (0.03/0.06/100%) and Neisseria meningitidis (< or = 0.002/0.004/100%). BAL9141 susceptibility at < pr = 4 mg/L (100% S) surpassed that of ceftriaxone (CRO; 1% S) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q-D; 92% S) against MRSA and MR-CoNS (CRO 0.9% S; Q-D 94% S). All S. pneumoniae were inhibited by BAL9141 at < or = 1 mg/L compared with CRO (90% S) and levofloxacin (LVX; 98% S). Susceptibility rates for viridans group streptococci to BAL9141 (>98%) were also higher than to CRO (86%) and LVX (96%). BAL9141 demonstrated excellent activity against most species of wild-type enteric bacilli, with > or = 95% of isolates being susceptible; however, only modest activity was observed for BAL9141 against non-fermentative Gram-negative species and ESBL-producing Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae. BAL9141 demonstrated excellent activity against many tested pathogens displaying various resistance phenotypes, and should be particularly valuable in the treatment of MRSA as well as for drug-resistant streptococci, while maintaining a spectrum resembling a 'third-generation' cephalosporin against other clinically important species.
TI  - [Surveillance for antimicrobial resistance: VIRA Study].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Resistance to antimicrobial drugs has increased in recent years. The aim of this multicenter study was to determine the current situation in Spain regarding the resistance patterns of the most common infectious agents to antimicrobial drugs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total 1,475 strains isolated in 38 hospitals in October 2001 were studied. These included 294 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 149 clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), 96 Enterococcus faecium, 1 ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, 204 penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100 ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, 361 ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli, 160 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 110 Acinetobacter baumannii. Sensitivity to various antibiotics was studied by a broth microdilution method. Additionally, an epidemiologic survey was conducted in the participating hospitals to determine the incidence of these multi-drug resistant microorganisms. RESULTS: Overall incidence of ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli and MRSA strains was 24% in both cases. The pneumococci were resistant to several antibiotics. Telithromycin showed excellent activity against all the pneumococci, including those resistant to macrolides. Most MRSA isolates were resistant to quinolones and macrolides. All the staphylococci were susceptible to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin. Only 50% of A. baumannii strains were susceptible to imipenem. CONCLUSION: The results of this study evidence increasing multi-drug resistance among various microorganisms, such as MRSA, CNS, ampicillin-resistant enterococci, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci, and underline the need for surveillance programs to gain information on this significant therapeutic problem.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic properties of HMR 3004, a novel ketolide, on respiratory pathogens, enterococci and Bacteroides fragilis demonstrated by studies of time kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The pharmacodynamic properties of the novel ketolide (a new class of macrolide) antibiotic, HMR 3004, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect. METHODS: The time-kill kinetics were studied at two inocula against three strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Bacteroides fragilis. The postantibiotic effects of HMR 3004 were also investigated on these organisms at concentrations equivalent to 1, 4 and 10 x MIC. RESULTS: The time kill-kinetic data demonstrated that HMR 3004 is inoculum dependent and predominantly bacteriostatic being only slowly bactericidal at higher concentrations. HMR 3004 exhibited a significant postantibiotic effect with all strains studied, ranging from 1.9--6.2 h at 10 x MIC. CONCLUSIONS: The bacteriostatic activity and significant postantibiotic effect demonstrated by HMR 3004 are similar to those previously obtained with other macrolides.
TI  - In vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against selected bacterial pathogens isolated in Italy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin, against 732 clinical strains recently isolated in Italy. METHODS: Susceptibility tests were performed according to NCCLS-guided MIC methodology. Pathogens included in the evaluation included 108 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 124 coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates, 158 Streptococcus pyogenes isolates, 30 Streptococcus agalactiae isolates, 30 b-hemolytic streptococcal isolates, 18 Streptococcus sanguis isolates, 80 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 69 Enterococcal isolates, 40 Haemophilus influenzae isolates, 30 Moraxella catarrhalis isolates and, finally, 30 Gram-positive and 25 Gram-negative anaerobes. RESULTS: Quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibited Staphylococcus aureus and other Staphylococcus spp., irrespective of their oxacillin or erythromycin resistance phenotypes. Similarly, streptococci were fully inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin. Enterococcus faecalis was not included in the spectrum of this streptogramin, while isolates of Enterococcus faecium were inhibited by the new compound. Respiratory pathogens such as H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin as well as all Gram-negative anaerobes tested. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a putative role for quinupristin/dalfopristin in the empirical treatment of severe nosocomial and community-acquired infections caused by pathogens often displaying resistance to multiple antibiotics. This drug may provide an alternative to glycopeptide compounds.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of DQ-113, a potent quinolone, against clinical isolates.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of DQ-113, formerly D61-1113, was compared with those  of antibacterial agents currently available. MICs at which 90% of the isolates tested are inhibited (MIC90s) of DQ-113 against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.03, 0.008, 0.03, and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively. Moreover, DQ-113 showed the most potent activity against ofloxacin-resistant and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, with a MIC90 of 0.25microg/ml. DQ-113 inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant strains, and Streptococcus pyogenes at 0.06 microg/ml, and DQ-113 was more active than the other quinolones tested against Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium with MIC90s of 0.25 and 2 microg/ml, respectively. Against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, DQ-113 showed the highest activity among the reference compounds, with a MIC range from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml. DQ-113 also showed a potent activity against Haemophilus influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains (MIC90, 0.015 microg/ml), and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.03 microg/ml). The activity of DQ-113 was roughly comparable to that of levofloxacin against all species of ENTEROBACTERIACEAE: The MICs of DQ-113 against ofloxacin-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa ranged from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml, which were four times higher than those of ciprofloxacin. From these results, DQ-113 showed the most potent activity against gram-positive pathogens among antibacterial agents tested.
TI  - In vitro activities of RWJ-54428 (MC-02,479) against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - RWJ-54428 (MC-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with a high level of activity against gram-positive bacteria. In a broth microdilution susceptibility test against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), RWJ-54428 was as active as vancomycin, with an MIC at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (MIC(90)) of 2 microg/ml. For coagulase-negative staphylococci, RWJ-54428 was 32 times more active than imipenem, with an MIC(90) of 2 microg/ml. RWJ-54428 was active against S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides (RWJ-54428 MIC range, < or = 0.0625 to 1 microg/ml). RWJ-54428 was eight times more potent than methicillin and cefotaxime against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MIC(90), 0.5 microg/ml). For ampicillin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant and high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains), RWJ-54428 had an MIC(90) of 0.125 microg/ml. RWJ-54428 was also active against Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-, gentamicin-, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. The potency against enterococci correlated with ampicillin susceptibility; RWJ-54428 MICs ranged between < or = 0.0625 and 1 microg/ml for ampicillin-susceptible strains and 0.125 and 8 microg/ml for ampicillin-resistant strains. RWJ-54428 was more active than penicillin G and cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant, -intermediate, and -susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90)s, 0.25, 0.125, and < or = 0.0625 microg/ml, respectively). RWJ-54428 was only marginally active against most gram-negative bacteria; however, significant activity was observed against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC(90)s, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). This survey of the susceptibilities of more than 1,000 multidrug-resistant gram-positive isolates to RWJ-54428 indicates that this new cephalosporin has the potential to be useful in the treatment of infections due to gram-positive bacteria, including strains resistant to currently available antimicrobials.
TI  - The in vitro activity of ABT773, a new ketolide antimicrobial agent.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ABT773, a ketolide antimicrobial agent, was investigated and compared with those of seven other antibiotics. Type strains and 733 Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic isolates of clinical origin and four CHLAMYDIA: isolates were used. The activity of ABT773 was very similar to that of telithromycin, the other ketolide tested. The MIC(90) was < or = 0.5 mg/L for all bacteria examined except methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Haemophilus influenzae and BACTEROIDES: spp. The antichlamydial activity of ABT773 was greater than that of telithromycin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. Neither an increase in the size of the inoculm nor the addition of human serum had any marked affect on the in vitro activity of ABT773.
TI  - In vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against gram-positive bacteria Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis in Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, resistance of Gram-positive cocci to common antibiotics has steadily increased. New antibacterial agents that are active against multidrug-resistant pathogens are urgently needed for the treatment of these pathogens. We conducted an in vitro study on the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin and other antibiotics against common clinical isolates of the gram-positive cocci, Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis. METHODS: The agar dilution method described by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of bacterial isolates from clinical specimens obtained from patients in a medical center. RESULTS: All Staphylococcus aureus isolates were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin (< or = 2 micrograms/ml). The MIC90s were 1 mg/ml for both methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S aureus. Quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibited streptococci at a concentration of 1 microgram/ml or less. The MIC90s were 1 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, S pyogenes and viridans streptococci. Ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium was inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin at 0.5 to 4 micrograms/ml, with an MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. H influenzae was inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin at 0.25 to 8 micrograms/ml, with an MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. B catarrhalis was inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin at 0.25 to 1 microgram/ml, with an MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. CONCLUSIONS: We found that quinupristin/dalfopristin showed good in vitro activity against staphylococci, streptococci and B catarrhalis but less in vitro activity against H influenzae.
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - Bacteriology of infected cavitating lung tumor.
AB  - Differentiation between in situ infection and simple tumor necrosis in cavitating lung tumors by means of imaging studies is difficult. In this study, we prospectively investigated the role of ultrasound (US)-guided transthoracic aspiration for bacteriologic examination of infected cavitating lung tumors, and the influence of the culture results on the treatment of patients. Twenty-two patients (18 men and four women) with cavitating lung tumors treated from January 1996 to October 1998 were included. All patients underwent US-guided transthoracic aspiration for bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures. Microorganisms were isolated from six of seven febrile patients and one of 15 nonfebrile patients. A total of nine pathogens were isolated from seven patients: Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 3); Haemophilus influenzae (n = 2); Enterococcus faecium (n = 1); Bifidobacterium (n = 1); Shewanella putrefaciens (n = 1); and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (n = 1). Two pathogens were isolated from the aspirate cultures in two patients, while the others had monomicrobial infection. The six febrile patients who had positive lung aspirate cultures were treated with empiric antimicrobial agents before the culture results were available, and the culture results led to adjustment of the antibiotic regimen in five of these. The clinical conditions of the six patients with infected cavitating lung tumors improved after the initiation of individualized antimicrobial treatment. Pneumothorax occurred in one patient, and was the sole procedure-related complication. In conclusion, US-guided transthoracic aspiration is helpful for differentiating infected cavitating lung tumors from simple tumor necrosis. Infection in cavitating lung tumors is common among febrile patients, and the culture results can guide modification of the antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial spectrum of a new broad-spectrum 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone, gatifloxacin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial spectrum of gatifloxacin was compared with those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. Gatifloxacin was two- to four-fold more potent than comparator quinolones against staphylococci, streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci (gatifloxacin MIC90s, < or =1 mg/L, except 4 mg/L against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium). Gatifloxacin was two-fold less potent than ciprofloxacin, and the same as or two-fold more potent than ofloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90s, 0.06-0.5 mg/L against most members of the Enterobacteriaceae and < or =1 mg/L against Proteus/Morganella spp.). Relative to the comparator quinolones, gatifloxacin was two- to four-fold more potent against Providencia spp., and had good potency against Acinetobacter spp. (MIC90s, 0.25-1 mg/L). Gatifloxacin and ofloxacin had similar anti-pseudomonal potency, with corresponding MIC90s of 4, 8 and 0.25 mg/L for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas stutzeri, while ciprofloxacin had two- to eight-fold more potency. The three quinolones were equipotent against Burkholderia cepacia (MIC90s, 8 mg/L), but gatifloxacin was two-fold more potent against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC90, 4 mg/L). Gatifloxacin was highly potent (MIC90s, 0.03-0.06 mg/L) against Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella spp., Helicobacter pylori and had at least eight-fold better anti-chlamydial and anti-mycoplasma potency (gatifloxacin MIC90s, 0.13 mg/L). The higher quinolone MICs for ureaplasma (MIC90s, 4-8 mg/L) may be due to the acidic pH of the ureaplasma test medium, which antagonizes quinolones. Like other quinolones, gatifloxacin had poor potency against Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, though it was eight- to 16-fold more potent against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MIC90, 0.25 mg/L). Of the three quinolones, only gatifloxacin had activity against Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium difficile. In summary, gatifloxacin is a broad-spectrum 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that is more potent than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria, chlamydia, mycoplasma, mycobacteria and anaerobes.
TI  - The role of recombination and mutation in 16S-23S rDNA spacer rearrangements.
AB  - The intragenomic heterogeneity of the bacterial intergenic (16S-23S rDNA) spacer  region (ISR) was analysed from the following species in which sequences for the complete rRNA operon (rrn) set have been determined (rrn number): Enterococcus faecalis (6) and E. faecium (6), Bacillus subtilis (10), Staphylococcus aureus (9), Vibrio cholerae (4), Haemophilus influenzae (6) and Escherichia coli (7). It was found that some spacer sequence blocks were highly conserved between operons of a genome, whereas the presence of others was variable. When these variations were analysed using the program PLATO and partial likelihood phylogenies determined by DNAml for each operon set, three regions showed significant (Z>3.3) spatial variation [Region I was 78-184 nt long (2.1<Z<49.4), Region II was 10-60 nt long (3.7<Z<23)] and Region III was 6 nt long (3.4<Z>4.4) possibly due to recombination or selection. Within Region I, there was sequence block variation in all operon sets [some operons contained tRNA genes (tRNAala, tRNAile or tRNAglu), whereas others had sequence blocks such as VS2 (S. aureus) or rsl (E. coli)]. Q Analysis of the ISR sequence from E. faecalis and E. faecium showed that there was more interspecies than intraspecies variation (both in DNA sequence and in the presence or absence of blocks). Dot matrix analysis of the sequence blocks in the nine rrn ISRs from S. aureus showed that there was significant homology between VS2 and VS5/VS6. Furthermore, repeat motifs with only A or T were present in higher copy numbers in VS5/VS6 than in VS2. Since these sequence blocks (VS2 and VS5-VS6) are related, intragenic evolution resulting in AT expansion may have occurred between these two regions. A model is proposed that postulates a role for recombination and AT-expansion in intra-genomic ISR variations. This process may represent a general mechanism of concerted evolution for bacterial ISR rearrangements.
TI  - [In vitro activities of 23 antimicrobial agents against 4,993 gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains isolated from multicenter of Japan during 1994--in vitro susceptibility surveillance.Levofloxacin-Surveillance Group].
AB  - In a surveillance study conducted during 1994 at 24 medical institutes from different geographical areas of Japan, the susceptibility of clinical isolates to twenty three comparative agents, such as ofloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, ampicillin, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin, oxacillin, piperacillin, cefaclor, cefotiam, cefdinir, cefclidin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, imipenem, aztreonam, vancomycin, minocycline, chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, amikacin, and gentamicin, were tested by the standard broth micro-dilution method. A total of 4,993 isolates tested in this study included Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), coagllase negative streptococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterobactericeae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa from patients with urinary tract infections or respiratory tract infections, and Haemophilus influenzae. For MSSA, S. pneumoniae, Enterobacteriaceae, and H. influenzae, more than 70% of the isolates was susceptible to fluoloquinolones. However, resistance occurred in more than 50% of MRSA and P. aeruginosa isolated from UTI. Fluoroquinolones were found to be effective against high level penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, the third generation cephem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae.
TI  - Comparative activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin and RPR 106972 and the effect of medium on in-vitro test results.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin and RPR 106972 were active in vitro against a wide range of aerobic Gram-positive organisms including Enterococcus faecium. However, most isolates of Enterococcus faecalis were resistant or of intermediate sensitivity. Against Staphylococcus aureus quinupristin/dalfopristin was more active but for all other species the range of activity of the two drugs was the same or RPR 106972 was more active. RPR 106972 was also more active against the respiratory pathogens Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Quinupristin/dalfopristin MICs for isolates of H. influenzae (1-8 mg/L) clustered around the breakpoint. There were differences in the quality of growth, but little difference in MICs or zone diameters was obtained on three different media: Mueller-Hinton (MHA), Iso-Sensitest (ISA), and Diagnostic Sensitivity Test (DST) agars. The addition of blood to the medium increased MICs 2- to 4-fold, with MHA showing the greatest increase, and reduced zone diameters around quinupristin/dalfopristin discs by 3-4 mm, with the greatest effect on ISA.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of HMR 3647, a new ketolide antimicrobial agent.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of HMR 3647, a novel ketolide, was investigated in comparison with those of erythromycin A, roxithromycin, clarithromycin (14-membered ring macrolides), amoxycillin-clavulanate and ciprofloxacin against 719 recent clinical Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic isolates and type cultures. HMR 3647 generally demonstrated greater activity than the other compounds with MIC90s of < or =0.5 mg/L, except for Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC90 > 128 mg/L), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 = 2 mg/L), Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 = 2 mg/L), Enterococcus faecium (MIC90 = 1 mg/L) and the anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90 = 2 mg/L) and Clostridium difficile (MIC90 = 1 mg/L). In general, an increase in the size of the inoculum from 10(4) to 10(6) cfu on selected strains had little effect on the MICs of HMR 3647. Additionally, the in-vitro activity of HMR 3647 was not affected by the presence of either 20 or 70% (v/v) human serum. The antichlamydial activity of HMR 3647 was generally greater than that of commonly used antichlamydial antimicrobials.
TI  - Comparison of in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms with quinolones and beta-lactam antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against 721 Gram-negative and 498 Gram-positive organisms was determined by the standard microdilution broth method using commercially prepared frozen microtiter plates. The activity of trovafloxacin was compared to ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, ampicillin/sulbactam (1:1), piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, and imipenem. Trovafloxacin had equal or greater activity compared with the other agents tested against Citrobacter diversus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans, group G streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and E. faecium. The reliability of the commercially prepared plates for testing the in vitro activity of the quinolones was evaluated by comparing identical isolates also tested by broth microdilution using laboratory prepared plates. The commercially prepared plates generally correlated, within one- to twofold dilutions, with the laboratory prepared plates. There was, however, a large discrepancy obtained when testing Enterobacter agglomerans and E. cloacae, where the commercially prepared plates yielded a significantly higher MIC90 value.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic properties of HMR 3647, a novel ketolide, on respiratory pathogens, enterococci and Bacteroides fragilis demonstrated by studies of time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  - The pharmacodynamic properties of a novel ketolide (a new class of macrolide), HMR 3647, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect (PAE). The time-kill kinetics were studied at two inocula against three strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Bacteroides fragilis. The PAEs of HMR 3647 were also investigated on these organisms at concentrations equivalent to 1, 4 and 10 x MIC. The time-kill kinetic data demonstrated that HMR 3647 is predominantly bacteriostatic and only slowly bactericidal at higher concentrations. HMR 3647 exhibited a significant PAE with all strains studied, ranging from 1.2 h to 8.2 h at 10 x MIC. The bacteriostatic activity and significant PAE demonstrated by HMR 3647 are similar to those previously obtained with other macrolides.
TI  - [Meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  - Meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position C1 which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (DHP-1), thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. Its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in C2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. Meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the PBPs. It covers gram positive aerobes (Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, Enterococcus faecalis, Rhodococcus equi, Listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, Vibrio, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria, Moraxella) and anaerobes (Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, and Propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: P. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and H. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci, streptococci and staphylococci). Meropenem has no activity on Enterococcus faecium, S. aureus resistant to methycillin, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). Resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the OprD porin (OprD2 in enterobacteria and P. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the PBPs (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).
TI  - In vitro evaluation of BO-3482, a novel dithiocarbamate carbapenem with activity  against methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  - BO-3482, a dithiocarbamate carbapenem, inhibited clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRS) at 6.25 microg/ml (MIC at which 90% of isolates tested are inhibited [MIC90]), while the MIC90 of imipenem was > 100 microg/ml. BO-3482 was generally less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, enterococci, and gram-negative bacteria, although BO-3482 showed better activity (MIC90) than imipenem against Enterococcus faecium, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis, and Clostridium difficile. The affinities (50% inhibitory concentrations) of BO-3482 for penicillin-binding protein (PBP) PBP 2' of MRS and PBP 5 of E. faecium (both PBPs have low affinities for ordinary beta-lactam antibiotics) were 3.8 and 20 microg/ml, respectively, reflecting the greater activity of BO-3482 against MRS than against E. faecium.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity and MIC quality control guidelines of RPR 106972  (RPR 112808/RPR106950): a novel orally administered streptogramin combination. The Quality Control Study Group.
AB  - RPR 106972 is a novel oral streptogramin combination with reported therapeutic potency against Gram-positive and certain respiratory tract pathogens. MICs for RPR 106972, quinupristin/dalfopristin, and seven comparison drugs were determined by the reference methods against 337 strains selected to define spectrum and potency. RPR 106972 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC ranges of 0.12 to 2 micrograms/ml and 0.5 to 2 micrograms/ml, respectively), and coagulase-negative staphylococci were also inhibited by RPR 106972 (MIC90, < or = 0.5 microgram/ml) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (MIC90, < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). Against all streptococcal strains tested (including penicillin-resistant pneumococcus), RPR 106972 was highly active with MIC results at < or = 1 microgram/ml. RPR 106972 inhibited Corynebacterium jeikeium (MIC90, 0.5 microgram/ml). Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.25 microgram/ml), and some Haemophilus influenzae (MIC50, 2 micrograms/ml). RPR 106972 and quinupristin/dalfopristin demonstrated little activity against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90s, 4 to 32 micrograms/ml) as compared to Enterococcus faecium (MIC90s, 0.5 to 1 microgram/ml) and other Enterococcus ssp. (MIC90s, 1 microgram/ml). Studies to establish MIC quality-control guidelines indicated the following ranges: for E. faecalis ATCC 29212, 0.5 to 4 micrograms/ml; for S. aureus ATCC 29213, 0.25 to 1 microgram/ml; and for Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619, 0.06 to 0.5 microgram/ml. The results of this study indicate that the in vitro activity of RPR 106972 against Gram-positive bacteria and selected Gram-negative respiratory organisms is promising and warrants additional studies of pharmacokinetics, and in vivo infection model dynamics.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of RU-59863, a C-7 catechol substituted cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of RU-59863, a so-called "fifth generation" catechol cephalosporin, was evaluated against 606 bacterial isolates and compared with the activities of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, and cefpirome. RU-59863 demonstrated a broad spectrum of inhibition and superior overall activity than comparators when tested against Enterobacteriaciae (MIC90s, 0.015 to 2 micrograms/ml), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 0.5 microgram/ml), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC90, 0.25 microgram/ml), Acinetobacter ssp. (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), and oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus ssp. (MIC90s, 0.5 to 8 micrograms/ml). Potent RU-59863 activity was also observed against beta-haemolytic and viridans gr. streptococci (MIC90s, 0.12-0.5 microgram/ml), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90s, 0.03 to 0.5 microgram/ml), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, 0.06 microgram/ml), and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC90, 0.06 micrograms/ml). RU-59863 demonstrated marginal potency against Enterococcus faecalis (MICs 2 to 16 micrograms/ml) and was inactive against Enterococcus faecium (MIC90, > 128 micrograms/ml). Oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were not inhibited by RU-59863 (MIC90s, 32 to 128 micrograms/ml). Among the cephalosporins tested, RU-59863 performed best versus ceftazidime-resistant Bush group 1 isolates and strains producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases. RU-59863 was also effective against many fluoroquinolone-, aminoglycoside-, and imipenem-resistant isolates. RU-59863 seems to be a significant advance in cephalosporin chemistry and activity, especially against Gram-negative pathogens resistant to current beta-lactam therapeutic agents. Further studies of human pharmacokinetics and against clinical infections are encouraged.
TI  - Detection of the phosphorylcholine epitope in streptococci, Haemophilus and pathogenic Neisseriae by immunoblotting.
AB  - The phosphorylcholine (PC) determinant in Streptococcus pneumoniae is known to be linked to the cell wall polysaccharides (C-Ps) and to the lipoteichoic acid (LTA) (Forssman antigen) of the plasma membrane. Western blotting with two PC specific murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) designated 145,F-2 (IgM) and 147,A-1 (IgA) showed a similar ladder-like pattern for all examined strains of S. pneumoniae and Streptococcus mitis. Purified antigens run in parallel indicated that this ladder pattern is due to the PC of LTA. Unlike other techniques, Western blotting thus enables the identification of only one of the streptococcal structures carrying the PC epitope. Gram-negative organisms were also examined, and six of 11 Haemophilus influenzae strains reacted with the MAbs. For this species, unlike the streptococci, only one fast moving band was detected. Analyses by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) detected the PC epitope in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) fraction from H. influenzae. Some strains of the Neisseriaceae family were also positive by Western blotting, but TLC and immunostaining did not detect the PC determinant in LPS.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of novel oral carbapenem DZ-2640.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of DZ-2640, against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was compared with those of penems and cephalosporins currently available. MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of the compound for clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains, were 0.10, 25, and 12.5 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and of penicillin-susceptible and -insusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.006, 0.025, and 0.20 microg/ml, respectively, and MIC90s of the compound were 6.25 and >100 microg/ml for Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, respectively. MIC90s of DU-6681a were 0.20, 0.10, and 0.025 microg/ml for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MIC50 and MIC90 of DU-6681a were 25 and 50 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a activity was not affected by different media, varied inoculum size (10(4) to 10(7) CFU), or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions against gram-negative bacteria, under alkaline conditions against gram-positive bacteria, and in human urine, as was the activity of the other antibiotics tested. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to DU-6681a was less than or equal to those of the reference compounds. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated the bactericidal action of DU-6681a against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and H. influenzae.
TI  - Antimicrobial characteristics of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid at 30:70 ratio) compared to alternative ratios for in vitro testing.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new streptogramin combination that occurs at a natural ratio and formulation of 30:70. Rapid metabolism of the dalfopristin component to RP 12536 in vivo puts in question the validity of in vitro test of spectrum with the parent combination. In studies of quinupristin with both dalfopristin and RP 12536, a wide range of ratios (30:70, 50:50, 70:30) were tested by reference MIC and MBC tests. No significant potency differences were observed between combination ratios or metabolic components when testing 256 bacterial strains. Quinupristin/dalfopristin or quinupristin/RP 12536 remained active, by bactericidal action against many staphylococci and Streptococcus ssp. Enterococcus faecium strains were susceptible (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml; static effect only) to the streptogramin, but E. faecalis, Pasteurella multocida, Pediococcus ssp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides fragilis were generally less susceptible (MIC90, > or = 8 micrograms/ml). The log phase inoculum was preferred for MBC and kill-curve tests with this combination. The 30:70 ratio in vitro susceptibility test of quinupristin/dalfopristin as used to date, seems to predict the potency and spectrum of this streptogramin accurately and all clinically important in vivo ratios of the injectable form or its major metabolites. Quinupristin/dalfopristin should be further investigated for clinical use against emerging resistant Gram-positive infections, especially penicillin-resistant streptococci and glycopeptide-resistant E. faecium that exhibit susceptibility in this investigation.
TI  - In vitro activity and spectrum of LY333328, a novel glycopeptide derivative.
AB  - Reference methods were used to determine the potency of LY333328, a semisynthetic glycopeptide derivative with a key N-alkylation substitution, against 833 strains (393 gram-positive strains and representative gram-negative bacilli) with various defined resistance mechanisms. The MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90S) (in micrograms per milliliter) of LY333328 and the percentages of strains at < or = 8 micrograms/ml were as follows: for oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 2 and 100%, and for oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 4 and 100%; for oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermis, 4 and 100%, and for oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 8 and 96%; for Streptococcus serogroups A, B, C, and G, 0.25 to 1 and 100%; for Streptococcus pneumoniae < or = 0.015 to 0.06 and 100%; for Enterococcus faecalis, 2 and 100%; and for vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium, 0.25 and 100%, and for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, 4 and 100%. LY333328 was not active (MIC50, > or = 16 micrograms/ml) against more than 400 representative strains of Enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonads, Acinetobacter spp., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, pathogenic Neisseria spp., and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. Gram-positive anaerobes were LY333328 susceptible (MICs, < or = 2 micrograms/ml). Test methods and conditions may have affected MICs of LY333328, with most (species variation) agar dilution MICs being greater than the broth microdilution MICs.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of a novel ketolide antimicrobial agent, RU-64004.
AB  - Ketolides, a novel macrolide subclass, possess a mode of action that is similar to that of structurally related macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) compounds. By using reference in vitro tests, the in vitro activity of RU-64004 was compared to those of six other MLS compounds against more than 800 clinical pathogens, including 356 gram-positive organisms. The spectrum of activity of the ketolide was most similar to that of clindamycin versus staphylococci and streptococci and superior to those of all macrolides tested against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant (vanA, vanB, and vanC) enterococcal isolates. The activity of the ketolide was greater than those of the macrolides, azalides, or clindamycin tested against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (MICs at which 90% of isolates are inhibited [MIC90S], 0.25 to 4 micrograms/ml), penicillin-resistant pneumococci (MIC90, 0.25 micrograms/ml), and most beta-hemolytic streptococci. All Streptococcus pneumoniae and beta-hemolytic streptococcus strain were inhibited by ketolide concentrations of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Against 165 erythromycin-resistant strains, RU-64004 inhibited (MICs, < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml) approximately one-third of staphylococci, all streptococci, and slightly more than one-half of the enterococci. Quinupristin-dalfopristin (a streptogramin combination) was active against all tested isolates with the exception of non-Enterococcus faecium enterococci, against which the ketolide exhibited greater potency (MIC50S, 0.03 to 2 micrograms/ml). The ketolide was also active against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.12 micrograms/ml), pathogenic Neisseria spp. (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), and many gram-positive anaerobes (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). RU-64004 may enhance the role of macrolide drugs in the treatment of some serious infections caused by MLS-resistant gram-positive organisms.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of a new parenteral penem, sulopenem].
AB  - Eighty percent minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC80) of sulopenem against clinically isolated 12 to 80 strains of each of different bacteria were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA): 0.20 micrograms/ml, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA): 50 micrograms/ml, coagulase-negative staphylococci: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Streptococcus pyogenes: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, Streptococcus pneumoniae: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, beta-streptococci: 0.05 microgram/ml, Enterococcus faecalis: 12.5 micrograms/ml, Enterococcus faecium: > 100 micrograms/ml, Escherichia coli CS2(R+): 0.10 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae: 0.05 microgram/ml, Proteus mirabilis: 0.10 microgram/ml, Proteus vulgaris: 0.20 microgram/ml, Morganella morganii: 0.39 micrograms/ml, Providencia rettgeri: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter freundii: 0.20 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae: 0.39 microgram/ml, Serratia marcescens: 1.56 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas cepacia: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Xanthomonas maltophilia: > 100 micrograms/ml, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus: 1.56 micrograms/ml, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae: 0.39 microgram/ml and Bacteroides fragil is: 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. Sulopenem possesses a stronger activity than flomoxef or cefuzonam against Gram-positive bacteria, the strongest activity among the antibiotics tested against Gram-negative bacteria except P. aeruginosa. Sulopenem has stronger affinities than imipenem to all fractions of PBPs of S. aureus, E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. marcescens, even of P. aeruginosa. Affinities of sulopenem to PBPs-1 and -3 of S. aureus, PBP-2 of E. coli were much stronger than those of imipenem (IPM). Sulopenem generally has small Ki values to all types of beta-lactamases and also has stronger permanent inactivation effect to Ia and IIb types of beta-lactamases than IPM. No synergistic bactericidal activity of sulopenem was apparent with serum complement. However, synergism of sulopenem with macrophages was prominent in bactericidal activity. The cells of E. coli were well phagocytosed and rapidly digested by cultured macrophages in the presence of a higher than 1/8 MIC of sulopenem. Moreover, sulopenem was more stable than imipenem against swine and human dehydropeptidase-Is. Sulopenem is one of the antibiotics that do not induce the appearance of subclones resistant to the drug.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. Rationale for clinical use.
AB  - Most Gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500; Synercid). Minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (MIC90) were < or = 1 mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and Listeria monocytogenes. Importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of S. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin G)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. Enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant Enterococcus faecium. E. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. Among the Gram-negative respiratory pathogens Moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and Haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. are resistant. The drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including Clostridium perfringens, Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus. Synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant E. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus with the combination of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. Quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus infection in rabbits, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. The drug is rapidly bactericidal against Gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the MIC, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of CS-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of CS-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone drug, was tested against 761 clinical isolates. CS-940 activity against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae was most similar to that of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, with a large range of MICs inhibiting 90% of isolates tested (MIC90S) of 0.015 to 16 micrograms/ml (median MIC90, 0.06 micrograms/ml). CS-940 had greater activity than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin when they were tested against Acinetobacter spp. (MIC90S, 0.03 micrograms/ml) and Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia (MIC90S, 2 micrograms/ml). CS-940 demonstrated a high degree of potency against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria spp. (MIC90S, < or = 0.06 micrograms/ml). CS-940 was two- to eightfold more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. CS-940 was also very active against Streptococcus spp. and enterococci, for which MIC90S were < or = 2 micrograms/ml; for Enterococcus faecium, however, the MIC90 was 4 micrograms/ml. CS-940 was generally less active than a comparison investigational fluoroquinolone, clinafloxacin. This compound appears promising by in vitro test analysis and warrants further in vivo trials.
TI  - Meropenem: a microbiological overview.
AB  - Meropenem is a parenteral carbapenem antibiotic which has excellent bactericidal  activity in vitro against almost all clinically significant aerobes and anaerobes. Its high activity is explained by ease of entry into bacteria combined with good affinity for essential penicillin binding proteins, including those associated with cell lysis. Breadth of spectrum is due, in part, to stability to all serine-based beta-lactamases, including those which hydrolyse third-generation cephalosporins. Meropenem has an antibacterial spectrum which is broadly similar to that of imipenem but, whilst slightly less active against staphylococci and enterococci, it is more active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, all Enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae. Amongst common human pathogens, only methicillin-resistant staphylococci and Enterococcus faecium are uniformly resistant to meropenem. The meropenem MICs for penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae are higher than for penicillin-susceptible strains but the organisms remain susceptible. Clinical susceptibility in vitro to meropenem is defined by MICs of < or = 4 mg/L, intermediate susceptibility by MICs of 8 mg/L and MICs of > or = 16 mg/L define resistance; equivalent figures for zones of growth inhibition are > or = 14 (susceptible), 12-13 (intermediate) and < or = 11 (resistant) mm. Studies in guinea pig models of systemic infection and infections localised to the lungs, urinary tract and the central nervous system, some of which used immunocompromised animals, confirm the potential of meropenem demonstrated in vitro. These factors, combined with the human plasma, tissue or urinary concentrations of meropenem which exceed modal MICs for the pathogens isolated in clinical trials for most or all of the recommended 8 h dosing interval, predict that meropenem should be efficacious in the treatment of infections at many body sites.
TI  - Antimicrobial characterization and interrelationships of dirithromycin and epidirithromycin.
AB  - Dirithromycin is the 9-N,11-O-oxazine adduct formed from 9(S)-erythromycylamine and 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)acetaldehyde in which the methoxyethoxymethyl substituent on the oxazine ring possesses the R configuration. Epidirithromycin is its isomer in which the methoxyethoxymethyl substituent has the opposite (S) configuration. Both compounds readily epimerize in solution, reaching an equilibrium ratio of 85:15 in favor of dirithromycin, given sufficient time. The rate of interconversion is dependent upon pH, temperature, and solvent. An enriched sample of epidirithromycin (95% purity) was synthesized by condensing erythromycylamine and 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)acetaldehyde in diethyl ether as the reaction solvent, and the product was fully characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and high-pressure liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analysis. Both oxazine derivatives readily hydrolyze to erythromycylamine, so all three compounds exhibit the same antibiotic activity in vitro. In order to determine whether dirithromycin itself possesses significant antimicrobial activity without initial hydrolysis to erythromycylmine, inhibition of cell-free ribosomal protein synthesis was measured under conditions which were adapted to minimize hydrolysis, as measured by analytical HPLC in parallel experiments. Under these particular conditions, inhibition of ribosomal protein synthesis by dirithromycin was < 10% of the value measured for erythromycylamine.
TI  - [Nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1991. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and CNS showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (DMPPC). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. Though Enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (ABPC), piperacillin (PIPC), imipenem (IPM), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST) compounds, Enterococcus faecium was resistant to almost all antibacterial agents but to ST compounds. High susceptibility rates were observed for strains of Enterobacter cloacae to IPM, gentamicin (GM) and ofloxacin (OFLX) and for strains of Proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (LMOX), IPM, aztreonam (AZT), GM and OFLX. Serratia marcescens and Bacteroides fragilis group were highly susceptible only to IPM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (CAZ), IPM, amikacin (AMK) and tobramycin (TOB). Pseudomonas cepacia was relatively susceptible only to CAZ. IPM showed strong antibacterial activity to many species except for S. aureus and CNS.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. SY5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Clostridium spp., and Bacteroides fragilis. Against Providencia spp., Proteus spp., and Haemophilus influenzae, SY5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. SY5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Enterococcus faecium, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. The bactericidal activities of SY5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the MICs for clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. SY5555 was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. However, SY5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by X. maltophilia (L-1) and P. aeruginosa/pMS354 beta-lactamases, two Bush group 3 beta-lactamases, SY5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from C. freundii GN7391 and E. cloacae GN7471 strains. These results suggest that SY5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activities of broad spectrum quinolones against clinical  bacterial isolates].
AB  - In vitro activities of broad-spectrum quinolones (sparfloxacin (SPFX), ciprofloxacin (CPFX), lomefloxacin (LFLX), fleroxacin (FLRX), and levofloxacin (LVFX) were examined against clinical bacterial isolates: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae). Antibacterial activities of SPFX, CPFX, and LVFX against Gram-negative bacteria such as K. pneumoniae, M. (B) catarrhalis and H. influenzae were better than those of FLRX and LFLX. SPFX showed the highest activity against all Gram-positive bacteria tested in this study. However, strains showed high MIC (> or = 16 micrograms/ml) to SPFX were found among MRSA, E. faecalis, and E. faecium, whose isolation frequencies were 28.6%, 10.0%, and 6.7%, respectively. The results of this study suggest that resistant strains of Gram-positive bacteria against new quinolone might increase among clinical isolates.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of aspoxicillin of fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - The Antimicrobial activity of aspoxicillin (ASPC) in terms of minimum inhibitory  concentration (MICs) was compared with those of other penicillin antibiotics (PCs) against clinical isolates sent to us from medical institutions throughout Japan in 1988, 1990 and 1992 and strains isolated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections. 1. The MIC80's of ASPC against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis group were almost the same as those against these isolates in 1985 to 1986. 2. A trend for increasing susceptibility to PCs including ASPC was observed in the isolates of S. aureus and Haemophilus influenzae. This trend in S. aureus was attributed to the appearance of non beta-lactamase producing strains associated with the development of highly resistant strains among the methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) as well as to a tendency toward yearly decreasing frequency of MRSA. The trend for the increased susceptibility in H. influenzae was related to the decrease in the number of beta-lactamase production strains. 3. The frequency of the strains highly resistant to PCs including ASPC increased. 4. No PCs-resistant strains were observed among the so-called beta-streptococci, while among alpha-streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae there was a trend for decreasing frequency of strains with lower susceptibility to PCs or those with resistant to PCs. These strains may be variants which were also resistant to cephems and had penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Meanwhile, a high frequency of highly PCs-resistant strains were noted among Enterococcus faecium. In view of the fact that the PCs-resistance of E. faecium is known to be related to PBPs, the pattern of the susceptibility of the recent clinical isolates to beta-lactams is considered to be multimodal.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance patterns in Korea.
AB  - Recent in-vitro test results showed that in Seoul (Korea) aerobic Gram-negative bacilli are often resistant to ampicillin and to the first-generation cephalosporins, but chloramphenicol-resistant Salmonella typhi are extremely rare. Almost all isolates of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, 49% of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and 31% of Haemophilus influenzae were beta-lactamase producers. Seventhy-two percent of pneumococci were penicillin G resistant and 62% of staphylococci were methicillin resistant. Among the Enterococcus faecium, 59% were resistant to high-level gentamicin, but glycopeptide-resistant isolates were not found. Thirty-eight percent and 5% of Bacteroides fragilis were resistant to clindamycin and cefoxitin, respectively. In conclusion, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria are prevalent in Korea.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of clarithromycin. Spanish Collaborative Group.
AB  - The activity in vitro of clarithromycin, a new macrolide, was compared to that of various antibiotics in tests using 3,880 clinical isolates. Clarithromycin was two times more active than erythromycin against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, streptococci of groups C, G and F, Brucella melitensis, Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma spp., 16 times more active against Ureaplasma urealyticum and 2 to 4 times less active against Campylobacter spp. In general, clarithromycin showed intrinsic activity 2 to 4 times higher than that of roxithromycin and 4 to 8 times higher than that of miocamycin. Cross-resistance was found between the macrolides. Clarithromycin was bactericidal against Streptococcus spp. and Haemophilus influenzae.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of BAY Y3118, a new full-spectrum fluoroquinolone.
AB  - BAY Y3118, 1-cyclopropyl-7-(2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-8-yl)-6-fluoro-8- chloro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid hydrochloride, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity against an expanded spectrum of species including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and also anaerobes such as Bacteriodes fragilis and Clostridium perfringens. MIC90s for S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. faecalis, and S. pneumoniae clinical isolates were 0.125, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Against methicillin- and/or quinolone-resistant S. aureus, MIC50 levels of BAY Y3118 were 10- to 100-fold lower than those of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, or ciprofloxacin. The potency of BAY Y3118 against all members of the Enterobacteriaceae generally was equal to or 2-fold greater than that of ciprofloxacin or tosufloxacin. BAY Y3118 was also highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Increasing inoculum concentrations had a minimal effect on MIC determinations. The drug was determined to be bactericidal based upon reference MBCs and time-kill curves. From the results presented here, it was concluded that this new compound surpasses other known 4-quinolones both in spectrum and activity and that its further evaluation by in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies seems warranted.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of WIN 57273, a new fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agent.
AB  - The in vitro activity of WIN 57273, a new fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agent, was evaluated against approximately 600 bacterial isolates. The new drug was 4- to 128-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against a broad range of gram-positive organisms, with the new drug inhibiting 90% of strains of each species except Enterococcus faecium at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. WIN 57273 was four- to eightfold less active than ciprofloxacin against many members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, but the MICs of the new drug for 90% of strains tested (MIC90s) were less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml (range, 0.25 to 8 micrograms/ml) for all species. Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Legionella spp. were highly susceptible (MIC90s, less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml). WIN 57273 demonstrated excellent activity against anaerobes (MIC90s, less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml), and the drug was also more active than ciprofloxacin against 30 strains of Mycobacterium avium-M. intracellulare (MIC, 0.1 to 1.0 microgram/ml). The activity of WIN 57273 against gram-positive organisms was minimally affected by pH and increased at low pH (5.4) against gram-negative organisms. The bactericidal activity of WIN 57273 was demonstrated by time-kill techniques against selected organisms. The frequencies of spontaneous resistance to the new agent were low, but resistant colonies could be selected after serial passage of initially susceptible organisms through incremental concentrations of the drug.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of meropenem on clinical isolates from the United Kingdom.
AB  - MICs of meropenem were determined for a wide range of common bacteria of clinical importance. For Enterobacteriaceae, Aeromonas spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Gardnerella vaginalis, Campylobacter coli/jejuni, beta-haemolytic streptococci and anaerobes other than Clostridium difficile, MICs were almost always within the range 0.002-0.5 mg/l. The activity of meropenem for these organisms was always greater than that of imipenem and piperacillin, and was similar to that of ceftazidime and cefotaxime except that strains resistant to these latter, and to piperacillin, were usually sensitive to imipenem and meropenem. Meropenem was also active against most non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli, with MICs in the range 0.12-4 mg/l but Pseudomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia was often resistant, as it was to all the other drugs tested. Staphylococci, Strreptococcus pneumoniae and other alpha-haemolytic streptococci were usually more sensitive to imipenem than to meropenem, but even methicillin-resistant staphylococci were sensitive to both drugs (MICs less than 4 mg/l). Enterococci were also less sensitive to meropenem than to imipenem, and Enterococcus faecium was invariably highly resistant to all the drugs tested except ciprofloxacin, which had marginal activity. Results for Ps. maltophilia and Haem. influenzae were affected by media used for sensitivity testing.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of erythromycin, vancomycin and pristinamycin.
AB  - We have studied the in-vitro activity of erythromycin, vancomycin and pristinamycin against 1,006 clinical isolates comprising streptococci, staphylococci, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae and anaerobes. In-vitro studies show pristinamycin to inhibit staphylococci and streptococci, including erythromycin highly-resistant organisms, at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. Although pristinamycin's mean MIC for streptococci is higher than that of erythromycin, pristinamycin is bactericidal, whereas erythromycin is bacteristatic against Streptococcus agalactiae and oral streptococci. Enterococci were less uniformly susceptible to pristinamycin: 58 of the 94 Enterococcus faecalis tested were resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 3.12 mg/l). 14 of the 15 isolates of Enterococcus faecium were inhibited by less than or equal to 1.56 mg/l pristinamycin. Pristinamycin showed poor activity against Haemophilus influenzae (mode MIC 1.56 and MIC90 of 3.12 mg/l) but all except two of the 100 Neisseria gonorrhoeae tested were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l pristinamycin. Pristinamycin inhibited all nine Clostridium spp. at less than or equal to 0.39 mg/l and 38 of 40 strains of anaerobic gram-positive cocci at less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. It was less effective against the Bacteroides fragilis group: (MIC90 3.12 mg/l). Pristinamycin had poor bactericidal activity against the anaerobes tested.
