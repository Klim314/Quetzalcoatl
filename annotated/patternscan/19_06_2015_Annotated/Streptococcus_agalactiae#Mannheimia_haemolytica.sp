TI  == potential pathogens carried by spanish ibex (capra pyrenaica hispanica) in southern spain.
AB  == the spanish ibex (capra pyrenaica hispanica) population of southern spain was surveyed for potential pathogens associated with the conjunctiva, external ear canal, as well as reproductive and upper respiratory tracts. we sampled 321 ibex  (131 adult males, 100 adult females, and 90 yearlings); these included 271 apparently healthy animals and 50 that were naturally infected with sarcoptes scabiei. a total of 688 bacterial isolates were identified (377 gram-negatives, 225 gram-positives, and 86 mycoplasma spp.); sex, age, location, infection with s. scabiei, and disposition of the animal (free-ranging versus captive) were evaluated as risk factors for infection. infections with mycoplasma agalactiae and mycoplasma arginini were associated with age, having a higher frequency of isolation in young animals. with escherichia coli, mannheimia haemolytica, pasteurella multocida biotype a, and staphylococcus aureus, significantly higher  isolation rates were associated with adults. the isolation frequency for e. coli  was higher in females, whereas moraxella bovis isolations were mostly associated  with males. the presence of mange increased the risk of infection with both streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus and m. haemolytica. the geographic origin of sampled animals was related to the isolation of branhamella ovis, m. agalactiae, and all pasteurella sp. isolations of m. haemolytica, p. multocida biotype a, e. coli, and b. ovis were more prevalent in samples from free-ranging  rather than captive animals. of the gram-positive bacteria, s. aureus represented the predominant species isolated from nasal, vaginal, and ocular samples. mycoplasma agalactiae and m. arginini were the predominant mycoplasma spp., and both were associated most often with the external ear canal. the most frequently  isolated gram-negative bacteria included e. coli, m. haemolytica, p. multocida biotype a, and b. ovis. isolation rates of gram-negative species varied by source. in nasal samples, m. haemolytica and p. multocida biotype a were isolated most frequently, whereas in ocular and vaginal samples, b. ovis and e. coli, respectively, were most frequently isolated.

TI  == seven years survey of susceptibility to marbofloxacin of bovine pathogenic strains from eight european countries.
AB  == this study was conducted from 1994 to 2001 to determine the susceptibility of bovine pathogenic bacteria to marbofloxacin (a third generation fluoroquinolone used only in individual administration for animals). strains originated in bovine diseases from eight european countries. they were isolated from gut infections (escherichia coli, salmonellae), mastitis (e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, s. agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae) and respiratory diseases (mannheimia haemolytica, pasteurella multocida, haemophilus somnus). there was no change in the mic distributions for each species after the launch of marbofloxacin in 1997. in e. coli, a resistant population was present before the  use of marbofloxacin having been induced by co- or cross-resistance to other antibiotics used previously. over this period the only a significant change seen  was an increase in mic(90) of e. coli from the gut (1.275 microg/ml in 1994/1995  to 5.098 microg/ml in 2001). all the salmonellae were susceptible to marbofloxacin with a mic(90) = 0.073 microg/ml in 2001 without development of high level resistance. the use of marbofloxacin seems not to have favoured a significant increase and spreading of resistant bacteria.

TI  == biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  == the calgary biofilm device (cbd) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (mbec) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin g, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine  for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the cbd under selected conditions. the biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. biofilms composed of arcanobacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hyicus, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium renale, or corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but  as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. biofilm and planktonic streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. planktonic escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and  trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against e. coli growing as a biofilm. salmonella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. planktonic and biofilm pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. the cbd provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.
