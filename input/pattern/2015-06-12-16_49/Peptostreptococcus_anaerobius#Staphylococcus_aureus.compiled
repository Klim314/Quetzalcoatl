TI  - Antimicrobial activity of preparation Bioaron C.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of sirupus Bioaron C, a preparation, whose main ingredient is an extract from the leaves of Aloe arborescens, was tested against different microorganisms isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections. The experiments were performed on 40 strains: 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria, 13 strains of aerobic bacteria and 7 strains of yeast-like fungi from the genus Candida and on 18 reference strains (ATCC). The antimicrobial activity of Bioaron C (MBC and MFC) was determined at undiluted concentration. Bioaron C proved to be very effective against the microorganisms causing infections. At the concentration recommended by the producer, the preparation showed biocidal activity (MBC, MFC) against the strains of the pathogenic microorganisms, which cause respiratory infections most frequently, including, among others, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Parvimonas micra, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus anginosus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, already after 15 min. The MIC of Bioaron C against most of the tested microorganisms was 5 to 100 times lower than the usually applied concentration. The great antimicrobial activity means that the preparation may be used in the prevention and treatment of infections of the upper respiratory tract. Bioaron C may be an alternative or complement to classical therapy, especially in children.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of SMT19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against Clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  - The comparative in vitro activity of SMT19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined Clostridium difficile strains, 174 Gram-positive and 136 Gram-negative intestinal anaerobes, and 40 Gram-positive aerobes. SMT19969 was one dilution more active against C. difficile isolates (MIC range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; MIC90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. SMT19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against Gram-negative anaerobes, especially the Bacteroides fragilis group species, than vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that SMT19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. SMT19969 showed limited activity against other Gram-positive anaerobes, including Bifidobacteria species, Eggerthella lenta, Finegoldia magna, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with MIC90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. Clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with C. innocuum being susceptible (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) and C. ramosum and C. perfringens being nonsusceptible (MIC90, >512 mug/ml). Activity against Lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; MIC90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. Gram-positive aerobic cocci (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and streptococci) showed high SMT19969 MIC90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).
TI  - Subgingival microflora in inflammatory bowel disease patients with untreated periodontitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the subgingival microflora composition of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with untreated chronic periodontitis and compare them with systemically healthy controls also having untreated chronic periodontitis. METHOD: Thirty IBD patients [15 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 15 with ulcerative colitis (UC)] and 15 control individuals participated in the study. All patients had been diagnosed with untreated chronic periodontitis. From every patient, subgingival plaque was collected from four gingivitis and four periodontitis sites with paper points. Samples from the same category (gingivitis or periodontitis) in each patient were pooled together and stored at -70 degrees C until analysis using a checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique for 74 bacterial species. RESULTS: Multiple-comparison analysis showed that the groups differed in bacterial counts for Bacteroides ureolyticus, Campylobacter gracilis, Parvimonas micra, Prevotella melaninogenica, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, and Treponema denticola (P<0.001). CD patients had significantly higher levels of these bacteria than UC patients either in gingivitis or in periodontitis sites (P<0.05). CD patients harbored higher levels of P. melaninogenica, S. aureus, S. anginosus, and S. mutans compared with controls both at gingivitis and at periodontitis sites (P<0.05). UC patients harbored higher levels of S. aureus (P=0.01) and P. anaerobius (P=0.05) than controls only in gingivitis sites. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that even with similar clinical periodontal parameters, IBD patients harbor higher levels of bacteria that are related to opportunistic infections in inflamed subgingival sites that might be harmful for the crucial microbe-host interaction.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens related to chronic suppurative otitis media in individuals with cleft palate: bacteriological culture and polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the microbial etiology of chronic suppurative otitis media comparing the methods of classical bacteriological culture and polymerase chain reaction. DESIGN/SETTING/PATIENTS: Bacteriological analysis by classical culture and by molecular polymerase chain reaction of 35 effusion otitis samples from patients with cleft lip and palate attending the Hospital for Rehabilitation of Craniofacial Anomalies of the University of Sao Paulo, Bauru, Brazil. INTERVENTIONS: Collection of clinical samples of otitis by effusion through the external auditory tube. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Otolaryngologic diagnosis of chronic suppurative otitis media. RESULTS: Positive cultures were obtained from 83% of patients. Among the 31 bacterial lineages the following were isolated. In order of decreasing frequency: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (54.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (25.9%), and Enterococcus faecalis (19.2%). No anaerobes were isolated by culture. The polymerase chain reaction was positive for one or more bacteria investigated in 97.1% of samples. Anaerobe lineages were detected by the polymerase chain reaction method, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum , Bacteroides fragilis , and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius . CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cleft lip and palate with chronic suppurative otitis media presented high frequency of bacterial infection in the middle ear. The classical bacteriological culture did not detect strict anaerobes, whose presence was identified by the polymerase chain reaction method.
TI  - Primary sternal osteomyelitis due to Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  - Primary sternal osteomyelitis (PSO) is a rare syndrome. In adults, it usually occurs with underlying predisposing factors, such as immunodeficiency, or intravenous (IV) drug abuse. The infecting organism in these patients is usually Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Peptostreptococcus species are Gram-positive anaerobic cocci and are part of the normal flora of human mucocutaneous surfaces. Peptostreptococcus infection can occur in all body sites, including the central nervous system, head, neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, skin, bone, joint, and soft tissue. Here, we report on a 32-year-old previously healthy Chinese man who was diagnosed with PSO and P. anaerobius was yielded in the bacterial culture. He was treated empirically with antibiotics, but these failed. After additional limited surgical intervention with debridement, the PSO was cured.
TI  - Difficult intubation provokes bacteremia.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the prevalence of bacteremia after mask ventilation, laryngoscopy, and endotracheal intubation before induction of general anesthesia and to discover any correlation between traumatic manipulations and bacteremia. The specific bacteria responsible, knowledge of which may guide the prophylactic use of antibiotics, also were investigated. METHODS: Fifty patients were enrolled. Three 10-mL blood samples were collected from a peripheral vein 10 min before induction of anesthesia, 10 min after mask ventilation, and 10 min after intubation. All samples were placed in aerobic and anaerobic bottles for culture and bacterial identification. RESULTS: Cultures received 10 min after intubation were positive in 12% of patients. The following strains were isolated: Escherichia coli in two cases, Staphylococcus aureus in three cases, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius in one case. A strong positive correlation was found between difficult intubation and bacteremia. No correlation between bacteremia and easy intubation or between bacteremia and face mask ventilation was identified. CONCLUSION: Traumatic manipulations during difficult laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation could cause bacteremia. This finding may justify and guide prophylactic use of antibiotics.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
AB  - Human beta-defensin-3 (HBD3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. This study aimed to obtain recombinant HBD3 (rHBD3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of HBD3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. Genetic engineering was used to obtain active rHBD3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella melaninogenica, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces naeslundii, Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans. In an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rHBD3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. The ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. We conclude that HBD3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.
TI  - Quantitative survival of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms in Port-A-Cul and Copan transport systems.
AB  - Transport media should preserve the viability and stability of microorganisms in  clinical specimens. In this study, the Port-A-Cul transport system and the Copan transport system without charcoal, both designed to preserve anaerobes, were evaluated. Dacron swabs were inoculated with two combinations of facultative and anaerobic organisms typically found in vaginal swab samples. Combination I contained Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., group B streptococci, Lactobacillus crispatus, and Staphylococcus aureus. Combination II contained Lactobacillus iners, Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, Mycoplasma hominis, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella corporis, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Mobiluncus curtisii, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Gardnerella vaginalis. Duplicate swabs were placed into the two transporters and held for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h at 4 and 24 degrees C. Both transporters maintained the viability of organisms better at 4 degrees C than at 24 degrees C. Prevotella bivia and Prevotella corporis had a loss of viability in both transporters at both temperatures. However, at 24 degrees C, there was a significantly greater loss of viability for Mycoplasma hominis, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella corporis, and Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus when the organisms were stored in Copan transport medium than when they were stored in Port-A-Cul transport medium for 96 h (P < 0.002). Some organisms proliferated in the transport media, but when transporters were held at 24 degrees C for 96 h, a significantly greater increase in the concentrations of group B streptococci and Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus spp. organisms in Copan medium than in Port-A-Cul medium was observed (P < 0.002). At room temperature, the Port-A-Cul system is superior to the Copan system with respect to the preservation of fastidious microorganisms and the prevention of the proliferation of facultative organisms.
TI  - Breast abscess bacteriologic features in the era of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus epidemics.
AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Increasing rates of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections have also affected the microbial profile of breast abscesses. OBJECTIVE: To update the decade-old bacteriologic description of breast abscesses to improve the choice of initial antibacterial drug therapy. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: County hospital emergency department. PATIENTS: Forty-four women (mean age, 41 years; age range, 20-63 years) with breast abscesses. METHODS: All cultures from the breast abscesses of patients were reviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The microbiologic features and sensitivities of breast abscesses. RESULTS: Of 46 specimens only 28 showed bacterial yield (61%). Of these, 11 (39%) were polymicrobial, for an average of 1.4 isolates per specimen. The most common organism was S aureus, present in 12 of 37 aerobic cultures (32%), with MRSA in 7 (58%). The remaining organisms included coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (16%), diphtheroids (16%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), Proteus mirabilis (5%), and other isolates (22%). All MRSA was sensitive to clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and linezolid. Only 2 patients (29%) were sensitive to levofloxacin. Two anaerobic cultures were positive for Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. CONCLUSIONS: Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogenic organism in modern breast abscesses. Many breast abscesses have community-acquired MRSA, with more than 50% of all S aureus and 19% of all cultures being MRSA. This finding parallels the local and national increases in MRSA reported in other soft-tissue infections. With increasing bacterial resistance and more minimally invasive management of breast abscesses, understanding the current bacteriologic profile of these abscesses is essential to determining the correct empirical antibiotic drug therapy.
TI  - Production of antagonistic substance by Eikenella corrodens isolated from the oral cavity of human beings with and without periodontal disease.
AB  - AIMS: Antagonistic abilities may confer ecological advantages for micro-organisms in competitive ecosystems. However, reports regarding this phenomenon in Eikenella corrodens are not available. METHODS AND RESULTS: Nineteen E. corrodens strains, isolated from the oral cavity of human beings without periodontal disease (n = 5) and with aggressive (n = 9) and chronic (n = 5) periodontitis, as well as a reference strain (E. corrodens ATCC23834), were evaluated for antagonistic activity. The following indicators were used: Porphyromonas gingivalis FDC381, Prevotella intermedia ATCC25611, Actinomyces israelii ATCC12102, Eubacterium lentum ATCC25559, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius ATCC27337, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans FDCY4, Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC10953, Streptococcus sanguinis ATCC10557, Streptococcus uberis ATCC9927, Streptococcus mutans IM/UFRJ, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC33591 and Candida albicans ATCC18804. All the strains showed antagonism against at least one of the indicator strains. This phenomenon was more frequently observed for strains isolated from patients with chronic periodontitis (36.4%), than those from healthy subjects (20.6%) and those with aggressive periodontitis (10.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneous antagonistic spectrum exhibited by E. corrodens isolates suggests their ability to produce more than one antagonistic substance, whose ecological relevance is yet to be demonstrated. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first description of antagonistic compound production by E. corrodens and its relationships with the clinical status of the patients.
TI  - [Microbiocenosis of stomach in children with chronic gastritis].
AB  - Qualitative and quantitative composition of gastric microflora has been studied in 30 children with chronic gastritis. Bacteriological study of gastric biopsies and parietal mucus in 10 children with chronic gastritis not associated with Helicobacter pylori more frequently revealed conditionally pathogenic bacteria--Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, S. pyogenes (group A), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, P. prevotii and their associations. In 20 studied patients with H.pylori-associated chronic gastritis composition of local microflora was less diverse--conditionally pathogenic, lacto- and bifidobacteria often were absent. Study showed that eradication of H. pylori led to appearance of conditionally pathogenic bacteria in stomach microflora, which were frequently isolated in associations. Not effective treatment was associated with disappearance of lacto- and bifidobacteria and frequent isolation of Candida albicans.
TI  - Activities of four frog skin-derived antimicrobial peptides (temporin-1DRa, temporin-1Va and the melittin-related peptides AR-23 and RV-23) against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activities of two antimicrobial peptides belonging to the temporin family (temporin-1DRa from Rana draytonii and temporin-1Va from Rana virgatipes) and two peptides with structural similarity to the bee venom peptide melittin (AR-23 from Rana tagoi and RV-23 from R. draytonii) were evaluated against a range of reference strains and clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. These peptides were selected because they show broad-spectrum growth inhibitory activity against reference strains of several medically important aerobic microorganisms and against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. All peptides showed relatively high potency (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) </=25 microM) against the Gram-positive bacilli Propionibacterium acnes and Clostridium tertium and the Gram-positive cocci Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. Activity was lower and more variable against Clostridium septicum, Clostridium perfringens and Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. Growth of the Gram-negative bacilli Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium spp. was poorly inhibited, but all the peptides were active (MIC</=25 microM) against Prevotella melaninogenica. The clinical utility of the melittin-related peptides is limited by their toxicities, but temporin-1DRa and temporin-1Va have relatively low haemolytic activity against human erythrocytes and so represent candidates for drug development, particularly for topical therapy of infected surface lesions.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftobiprole against aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated  from diabetic foot infections.
AB  - Against 443 aerobic and anaerobic bacteria isolated from diabetic foot infections, ceftobiprole MICs (microg/ml) at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited were as follows: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 1; methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and Staphylococcus lugdunensis, 0.5; Anaerococcus prevotii, 0.125; Finegoldia magna, 0.5; Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, 1; Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, 4; Escherichia coli and Enterobacter species, 0.125; Klebsiella species, 2; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 8.
TI  - [Effect of a polyoxydonium immunoregulator on the biological properties of microorganisms].
AB  - The effect of the synthetic immunomodulator polyoxydonium (PO) on some biological properties of pathogenic bacteria (Shigella flexneri, Salmonella enteritidis), opportunistic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella melaninogenica, Propionibacterium propionicum, Clostridium difficile) and fungi (Candida albicans), isolated during enteric infections, enteric dysbiosis, pyoinflammatory diseases, was evaluated in a number of in vitro experiments. The study revealed that the recommended therapeutic concentration of PO decreased antilysozyme activity (ALA) and the anticomplement activity in Klebsiella, Shigella, Propionibacterium, Clostridium, bacteroids, fungi of the genus Candida, but increased ALA in nonhemolytic Escherichia. Under the action of PO an increased sensitivity of the microorganisms under study to definite antibiotics of the lincosamide, fluoroquinolon, carbapenem and cephalosporin groups was noted. The data obtained in this study reveal one of the possible mechanisms of the corrective action of PO on the microbiocenosis of the intestine in dysbiosis, enteric infections and pyoinflammatory diseases.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. Fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 127), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; n = 123), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), Enterococcus faecium (n = 50), Enterococcus avium (n = 50), and Peptostreptococcus spp. (P. anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. magnus, P. micros, P. prevotii; n = 125). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR, CFPM, FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. The decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual MIC range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.
TI  - In vitro antagonistic effect of Lactobacillus on organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess antagonistic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women as compared to the most common bacterial agents related to vaginosis. STUDY DESIGN: Antagonistic activity of different Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women not treated for infections with an antibiotic for the previous three months was screened using an agar slab method. The activity was tested against test organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis and/or urinary tract infections: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Prevotella bivia. RESULTS: Many of the 146 Lactobacillus strains tested exerted apparent antagonistic activities against gram-positive aerobic cocci and gram-negative rods, such as S aureus and E coli, and a marked number of Lactobacillus strains inhibited facultative bacteria, such as Gardnerella vaginalis and the anaerobes P anaerobius and P bivia. Only a few lactobacilli were able to inhibit growth of E faecalis and S agalactiae. Indicator bacteria growth inhibition probably relies upon several different complementary mechanisms. The specific indicator bacteria species determines which mechanism predominates. CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus strains taken from normal vaginal flora demonstrated antagonistic activity against a variety of bacteria related to vaginal and urinary tract infections. The specific occurrence rates of active Lactobacillus strains are different, and this difference is dependent on the indicator bacteria species.
TI  - [The range of antagonistic effects of Lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia, Bacteroides spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., Mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. On the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus Lactobacillus, most frequently L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus and L. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the same environment. The diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. Thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this ecosystem. The aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. It was found that nearly all of the tested Lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against Gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit Gram-positive aerobic cocci as Enterococcus faecalis or Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Gram-positive anaerobic cocci.
AB  - Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC) are a heterogeneous group of organisms defined by their morphological appearance and their inability to grow in the presence of oxygen; most clinical isolates are identified to species in the genus Peptostreptococcus. GPAC are part of the normal flora of all mucocutaneous surfaces and are often isolated from infections such as deep organ abscesses, obstetric and gynecological sepsis, and intraoral infections. They have been little studied for several reasons, which include an inadequate classification, difficulties with laboratory identification, and the mixed nature of the infections from which they are usually isolated. Nucleic acid studies indicate that the classification is in need of radical revision at the genus level. Several species of Peptostreptococcus have recently been described, but others still await formal recognition. Identification has been based on carbohydrate fermentation tests, but most GPAC are asaccharolytic and use the products of protein degradation for their metabolism; the introduction of commercially available preformed enzyme kits affords a physiologically more appropriate method of identification, which is simple and relatively rapid and can be used in routine diagnostic laboratories. Recent reports have documented the isolation in pure culture of several species, notably Peptostreptococcus magnus, from serious infections. Studies of P. magnus have elucidated several virulence factors which correlate with the site of infection, and reveal some similarities to Staphylococcus aureus. P. micros is a strongly proteolytic species; it is increasingly recognized as an important pathogen in intraoral infections, particularly periodontitis, and mixed anaerobic deep-organ abscesses. Comparison of antibiotic susceptibility patterns reveals major differences between species. Penicillins are the antibiotics of choice, although some strains of P. anaerobius show broad-spectrum beta-lactam resistance.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  - In addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. This investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol, Super EBA and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria Streptococcus fecalis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus species, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli B and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, Prevotella (Bacteroides) buccae, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella (Bacteroides) intermedia, Prevotella (Bacteroides) melaninogenica, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. After growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees C. Impregnated discs with the Super EBA liquid were used as positive controls. The antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and Scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials. Impregnated discs with Super EBA liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. Both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. Mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. Zinc oxide-eugenol and Super EBA pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The clinical importance of gram-positive anaerobic cocci isolated at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, in 1987.
AB  - The clinical importance of the gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC) isolated in 1987 at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, is assessed. Of about 800 anaerobic isolates, 209 (27%) were GPAC, of which 67 (32%) were from abscesses and 22 (11%) were in pure growth. Four species comprised 77% of the 168 isolates available for study: Peptostreptococcus magnus (55 isolates, 33%), P. micros (23, 14%), P. asaccharolyticus (24, 14%) P. asaccharolyticus (24, 14%) and P. anaerobius (27, 16%). Different species were associated with different sites, from P. magnus (usually skin-associated sites; normally cultured with aerobes, infrequently with other anaerobes), P. asaccharolyticus (distributed widely) and P. anaerobius (usually genitourinary and gastrointestinal; always below the diaphragm) to P. micros (always deep sites with other anaerobes). P. magnus was isolated from 15 abscesses and was obtained in pure culture from 11 specimens, six of them abscesses developing from infected sebaceous cysts. P. micros was usually isolated from soft tissue abscesses, never from the skin, and with a characteristic mixed flora consisting of "Streptococcus milleri" and anaerobic gram-negative rods. P. heliotrinreducens was a rare isolate from similar specimens. P. asaccharolyticus was cultured from a wide variety of sites, typically mixed with both aerobes and anaerobes, and frequently from abscesses. Most isolates of P. anaerobius came from gastrointestinal or female genitourinary specimens, never from above the diaphragm and rarely from the skin; cultures were usually heavily mixed. Isolates of P. vaginalis and the "bGAL" group made up 11% of str ains and were usally cultured from superficial sites, P. vaginalis often from post-operative wound infections with Staphylococcus aureus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, FK037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between January 1992 and June 1993. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for Streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for Peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis. FK037 was superior in potency to ceftazidime against all strains except E. faecalis, P. anaerobius and P. bivia. It was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and P. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. FK037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against MRSA, S. agalactiae and E. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except G. vaginalis and B. fragilis that were 4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to FK037.
TI  - Peptostreptococcal infection in children.
AB  - 680 Peptostreptococcus sp. (Ps) were recovered from 598 (34%) of 1,750 specimens  obtained from 554 patients. They included 103 Ps asaccharolyticus, 74 Ps magnus, 56 Ps prevotii, 51 Ps micros, 46 Ps anaerobius, 11 Ps morbilorum, and 10 Ps saccharolyticus. Most infections were polymicrobial (in 553 instances or 92%) but in 45 (8%), Ps were recovered in pure culture. Most Ps were isolated from abscesses (237), ears (104), peritoneal fluid (95), lung infections (66), bone (30) and sinuses (24). Predisposing conditions were present in 224 (40%) children. These were previous surgery (54), immunodeficiency (43), malignancy (35), trauma (34), diabetes (23), prematurity (22), steroid therapy (19), foreign body (10) and sickle-cell anemia (7). The organisms most commonly isolated with Ps were Bacteroides sp. (276, including 190 B. fragilis group), Prevotella sp. (159), Fusobacterium sp. (122), Escherichia coli (114), and Staphylococcus aureus (97). Antimicrobial therapy was administered to all but 14 patients. Surgical drainage or correction of pathology was performed in 307 (56%) patients. 10 patients (2%) died of their infection. These data illustrate the importance of Ps and suggests their enhancing potentials in infection in children.
TI  - Experimental studies of survival of anaerobic bacteria at 4 degrees C and 22 degrees C in two different transport systems.
AB  - The survival of anaerobic bacteria on swabs in two different transport systems at 4 degrees C and 22 degrees C was evaluated. The transport systems were a charcoal-impregnated cotton swab in modified Stuart transport medium (MST), and a viscose swab in modified SIFF transport medium (BTM) (Bionor). The following eight clinical strains of anaerobic bacteria were tested for quantitative recovery at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h; Fusobacterium necrophorum, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides intermedius, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptococcus magnus, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium tetani, and Actinomyces israelii. Additionally, a mixture of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was tested together with Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium necrophorum and Clostridium perfringens. Both transport systems preserved the bacteria, but the BTM medium gave a better quantitative recovery of the bacteria than the MST in 29/64 (45%) of the experiments, whereas the opposite was the case in 15/64 (23%) of the experiments (p < 0.05). There was no significant strain-related difference between the recovery of 10 different B. fragilis strains. There was no major difference in the recovery of the anaerobes in the two systems at 4 degrees C compared to 22 degrees C, except for Fusobacterium necrophorum, which survived best at 4 degrees C in the Bionor transport system.
TI  - Use of modified norleucine-tyrosine broth in identification of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  - Gas-liquid chromatography was employed to analyze the volatile and nonvolatile acids produced in modified norleucine-tyrosine (MNT) broth by various gram-positive cocci. The MNT broth consists of 0.5% Trypticase (BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md.), 0.5% yeast extract (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.), 0.2% L-norleucine, and 0.1% L-tyrosine. The microorganisms included reference strains and clinical isolates of Peptostreptococcus spp. (P. anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. indolicus, P. magnus, and P. prevotii), Staphylococcus spp. (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. saccharolyticus), and Streptococcus spp. (S. agalactiae, S. intermedius, S. mutans, S. sanguis I, and S. sanguis II). Only Peptostreptococcus anaerobius strains produced caproic and valeric acids in MNT broth cultures. All 11 P. anaerobius strains produced valeric acid in MNT broth, and only 1 strain failed to produce caproic acid in the medium. This unique feature aids in rapid, reliable identification of P. anaerobius with a minimum number of tests.
TI  - [A clinical study on ceftazidime in the treatment of intractable respiratory infections].
AB  - Ceftazidime (CAZ) was administered to 51 patients (37 males, 14 females) with respiratory infections including severe cases, accompanied by various underlying respiratory diseases. The clinical efficacy and side effects of CAZ were investigated. The mean age and body weight of these 51 cases were 62.6 years and 48.0 kg, respectively. CAZ was administered by intravenous drip infusion (daily dose of 2-4 g) for a mean of 14.7 days to a mean total dose of 56.7 g. Clinical efficacy rates were 64% (18 of 28 cases), 80% (16 of 20 cases) and 67% (2 of 3 cases) for airway and intermediary regional infections, pneumonia (including lung abscess) and pyothorax, respectively. In the bacteriological study, efficacy rates and bacterial eradication rates were 69% and 67%, 33% and 20%, 100% and 100%, and 100% and 100% for infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 cases), Staphylococcus aureus (6 cases), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6 cases) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4 cases), respectively, and bacterial eradication was achieved in both of 2 cases of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and 2 cases of Haemophilus influenzae, and 1 case each of Peptococcus sp., Fusobacterium necrophorum and Serratia marcescens. Side effects observed were eruption in 1 case (2%) and elevated GOT, GPT and Al-P values in 1 case (2%), but these cases tended to recover after CAZ treatment was discontinued.
TI  - Quantitative bacteriology of a case of acute parotitis.
AB  - It is generally assumed that the microorganisms responsible for acute suppurative parotitis are facultative anaerobes, primarily Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus viridans. A quantitative microbiologic investigation of an aspirate of pus from the case we report revealed a microbial flora (5.1 X 10(6) CFU/ml) consisting entirely of strict anaerobes (Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius). The strain of F. nucleatum was sensitive to metronidazole but resistant to penicillin, amoxicillin, and erythromycin (minimum inhibitory concentration greater than 16 micrograms/ml). P. anaerobius was sensitive to the antibiotics tested. It is concluded that a high concentration of viable anaerobic bacteria may be present in acute suppurative parotitis and thus pus obtained from cases of sialadenitis should be cultured with microbiologic methods capable of isolating strict anaerobes. Additionally, antibiotic sensitivity should be determined routinely.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria in brain abscess, a review; observation of 18 consecutive cases.
AB  - The aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of 18 consecutive cases of brain abscesses were studied. Two cases were sterile. In five cases there was a single bacterial isolate. In five cases there was a single bacterial isolate the organism being Staphylococcus aureus in two cases, Bacteroides fragilis in two cases and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius in one case. In the remaining eleven cases, more than one organism was isolated. A combination of anaerobe with an aerobe was observed in five cases and infections with more than one anaerobe in as many as six cases. Anaerobic organisms are the important pathogens in brain abscess and occurrence of infections by more than one organism is a common factor.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria in dentoalveolar abscesses.
AB  - The present study was initiated to determine the bacteriology of 40 orofacial abscesses of dental origin in patients who had taken antibiotics for several days. Bacteria were isolated from all but 2 specimens. Aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 21 cases, obligate anaerobic bacteria in 17 cases, whereas in 11 cases, polymicrobial growth was revealed. The average number of bacterial species was 2.1 per specimen. Gram positive aerobic micro-organisms predominated, namely, Staphylococcus epidermidis followed by Streptococci (group A) and Staphylococcus aureus. Among obligate anaerobes, Gram positive micro-organisms, peptostreptococci and peptococci were more often isolated, in the following decreasing order: Ps. productus, Ps. intermedius, Ps. parvulus, Ps. anaerobius, Pc. constellatus, Pc. prevotii. Gram negative anaerobic rods were detected in a small number of cases, namely B. corrodens, B. fragilis, B. melaninogenicus, B. ochraceus, B. oralis. Quantitative determination did not show any meaningful difference between aerobic and anaerobic isolates. Susceptibility tests against a series of antibiotics showed that ampicillin was the most active in aerobes and cefoxitin in anaerobes.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of photoradiation therapy with hematoporphyrin derivative.
AB  - Hematoporphyrin derivative (Hpd) localizes selectively in malignant and rapidly metabolizing tissues and undergoes a cytotoxic reaction when exposed to light of a specific wavelength. Hpd has been studied extensively with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of tumors but not with regard to bactericidal activity. This investigation assessed the effect of light-activated Hpd on various microorganisms, on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and on the interactions of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and bacteria. Light-activated Hpd was 99.9% bactericidal against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus M-G intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptococcus magnus, and Clostridium perfringens, but did not affect Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Candida albicans. Photoactivation of Hpd rendered 98% of polymorphonuclear leukocytes inviable. Combinations of light-activated Hpd and polymorphonuclear leukocytes had a 4-log (99.99%) bactericidal effect on both intra- and extracellular S. aureus. The ability of Hpd to localize in inflammatory tissues may have therapeutic applications in the treatment of abscesses.
TI  - Pathogenicity of anaerobic gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The pathogenicity of 20 strains of facultative or anaerobic gram-positive cocci (AGPC) was investigated by injecting them alone or mixed with other flora into mice, utilizing the subcutaneous abscess model. Abscesses induced by a mixture of two organisms were uniformly larger than those induced by single organisms. The relationships among seven AGPC strains, eight aerobes, and two Bacteroides spp. were determined by treating the infected animals with antibiotics and observing the effect of therapy directed against one or both organisms present in the abscess. A total of 70 different combinations were tested. As judged by their responses to antimicrobial therapy, facultative cocci or AGPC were relatively more important than the other species in 6 combinations, equally important in 35 combinations, and less important in 29 combinations. The AGPC most often found to be equal to or more important than the other bacteria were Peptococcus magnus, Streptococcus constellatus, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus were frequently found to be of more importance than the AGPC.
TI  - Cefamandole therapy in hand infections.
AB  - Hand lacerations, especially when inadequately treated, may result in infections  caused by aerobic or anaerobic bacteria. Anaerobic infections most commonly result from human bite injuries in which there is contact between hand and mouth. The search continues for an ideal antibiotic to employ when anaerobic organisms are suspected. In this study cefamandole, a new cephalosporin antibiotic, was employed whenever anaerobic hand infections were suspected following trauma. In each patient quantitative cultures for both aerobic and anaerobic organisms were obtained. All organisms isolated were tested by standard susceptibility assays for both aerobes and anaerobes. In the case of anaerobes, minimum inhibitory concentration assays were also performed. After the initial culture was obtained, each patient received approximately 1.5 gm of cefamandole every 6 hours for a period of 5 days. This therapy was changed only if susceptibility studies indicated resistance to cefamandole. In our patients, 58% of the infectious organisms were aerobic and facultative anaerobic and 42% were obligate anaerobes. The predominant organisms isolated were Staphylococcus aureus and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, which accounted for 42% of the infections. In most of the aerobic infections a single organism was isolated, whereas multiple organisms were identified in the anaerobic infections. All but one of the infections responded to cefamandole; the one that didn't was caused by Enterobacter cloacae and required treatment with an aminoglycoside. Because of its broad-spectrum coverage, which includes both aerobes and anaerobes, cefamandole is useful in treating infections, especially those resulting from human bites.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria associated with osteomyelitis in domestic animals.
AB  - Specimens of bony tissue or adjacent soft tissue from 19 animals with osteomyelitis were cultured aerobically and anaerobically. Fourteen specimens (74%) yielded anaerobic bacteria in pure culture or mixed with aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria. The most predominant genus encountered was an obligate anaerobe, Bacteroides. The most frequently isolated Bacteroides species was Bacteroides asaccharolyticus, which was isolated 5 times. The most frequently isolated anaerobe was Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, which was isolated 6 times. Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were the most frequently isolated aerobic bacteria, with 7 and 6 isolates, respectively.
TI  - Antigenic relationships and rapid identification of Peptostreptococcus species.
AB  - Antisera against whole cells of each Peptostreptococcus species (P. anaerobius, P. micros, P. parvulus, and P. productus) were produced in rabbits. When these antisera were reacted against sonically disrupted cells and culture supernatant fluids in Ouchterlony tests, lines of identity were obtained among the antigens from all the species and uninoculated culture medium. When the antisera were subsequently absorbed with the dehydrated culture medium used to grow the peptostreptococci, all cross-reactions in heterologous antigen-antibody combinations were eliminated, leaving only species-specific precipitin arcs. These absorbed antisera, specific for each Peptostreptococcus species by Ouchterlony tests, were used for rapid identification studies. Staphylococcus aureus-bearing protein A was sensitized with each absorbed antiserum. These reagents produced specific coagglutination reactions with suspensions of each Peptostreptococcus reference strain and with 16 clinical isolates. No cross-reactions occurred with the Streptococcus intermedius, Peptococcus magnus, or Peptococcus asaccharolyticus strains tested.
TI  - Deconjugation of bile acids by human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The purpose of this report is to present the deconjugation of bile acids by numbers of strains of bacteria in the small intestine and feces. The small intestinal juice was aseptically aspirated by a double lumen tube with a rubber cover on the tip devised by us ("Fukushima Type 1"). Bile acids were analyzed with thin layer chromatography. THE RESULTS: 1) Among aerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split conjugated bile acids was enterococcus, and most of the strains split were Staphylococcus (S.) epidermidis and Lactobacillus (L.) bifidus. Species of which none of the strains split were Escherichia (E.) coli, E. communior, E. freundii, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. buchneri, L. cellobiosus, L. bulgaricus, S. aureus, Aerobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida, proteus, serratia, and almost none of the species split was Intermediate coliform bacilli. 2) Among anaerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split were Bacteroides (B.) vulgatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformis, Corynebacterium (C.) granulosum, C. avidum, Peptostreptococcus (Peptostrept.) putridus, Eubacterium (Eubact.) lentum, Peptococcus (Pept.) grigoroffii, Pept. anaerobius, Veillonella (V.) orbiculus, and most of the strains split were Coryne. diphtheroides, Eubact. parvum, Peptostrept. intermedius. Species of which none of the strains split were Coryne, parvum, Peptostrept. micros, V. alcalescens, V. parvula, Catenabacterium (Catena.) catenaforme, and Catena. filamentosum. 3) All or none, or almost all or none, of the strains of each species tested split conjugated bile acids, and it seems probably that the presence or absence of this ability would be a proper character of eachspecies.
TI  - Survival of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria on cotton swabs in three transport systems.
AB  - The capacity of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to survive on cotton swabs placed  into a dry gassed-out CO2-filled tube (DGT), dry sterile aerobic tube (DAT), and a tube containing a modified Stuarts' transport medium (MST), was assessed. Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in numbers by 2 and 3 logs when stored in MST and DAT, respectively. The viability of P. aeruginosa, although retarded when compared to MSA and DAT, was not adversely affected by the CO2 environment in the DGT. The MST maintained relatively constant numbers of Streptococcus pyogenes during the 48-h storage period. The DAT and the DGT were unable to maintain the viability of S. pyogenes. Staphylococcus aureus, when stored in a DGT, DAT, or MST, was maintained in relatively constant numbers throughout the entire storage period. Of the four anaerobic bacteria evaluated (Bacteroides fragilis ssp. thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides melaninogenicus ssp. asaccharolyticus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius), only B. fragilis ssp. thetaiotamicron survived the 48-h storage period in the DGT. Under these test conditions the DGT did not adequately maintain the viability of the majority of anaerobic bacteria tested (when held on cotton swabs). However, the MST did maintain the viability of all species tested for at least the first 2 h of storage.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  - Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, Eh < -42 mV at pH 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic PMN. Anaerobic PMN were able to kill Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, viridans streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Peptococcus magnus normally. Organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic PMN included Staphylococcus aureus (strains Wood 46 and 502a), Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Salmonella typhimurium. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide may be important in the killing of some bacteria.
