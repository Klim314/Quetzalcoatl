TI  == use of real-time pcr technique in determination of major fibrolytic and non fibrolytic bacteria present in indian surti buffaloes (bubalus bubalis).
AB  == in the milk industry in india, buffalo breeds are most commonly used for milk production. efficiency of fiber digestion in ruminants is critical for animal productivity. bacteria play an important role in fiber digestion and utilization. absolute quantification real-time pcr was used to quantify ten bacterial species  in rumen fluid of surti buffalo fed green fodder, dry roughage and compound concentrate mixture. abundance of each target taxon was calculated as a fraction  of the total 16s rrna gene copies in the samples, using taxon-specific primers. bacterial populations showed a clear predominance of ruminococcus albus, which comprised 5.66% of the bacterial rrna gene copies in the samples. however, only 0.9% to 4.24% of the bacterial rrna gene copies were represented by the ruminal fibrobacter succinogenes, ruminococcus flavefaciens and prevotella species. the proportion of rrna gene copies attributable to selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus bovis, ruminobacter amylophilus, treponema bryantii and anaerovibrio lipolytica was even less abundant, each comprising < 0.11% of the bacterial rrna gene copies. the data suggest that the aggregate abundance of the  most intensively studied ruminal bacterial species is relatively low and that a large fraction of the uncultured population represents a single bacterial genus.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of brazilian propolis extracts against rumen bacteria in vitro.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of three brazilian propolis extracts was evaluated on  bacterial strains representing major rumen functional groups. the extracts were prepared using different concentrations of propolis and alcohol, resulting in different phenolic compositions. the propolis extracts inhibited the growth of fibrobacter succinogenes s85, ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1, ruminococcus albus  7, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens d1, prevotella albensis m384, peptostreptococcus sp. d1, clostridium aminophilum f and streptococcus bovis pearl11, while r. albus 20, prevotella bryantii b(1)4 and ruminobacter amylophilus h18 were resistant to all  the extracts. the inhibited strains showed also different sensitivity to propolis; the hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria (c. aminophilum f and peptostreptococcus sp. d1) being the most sensitive. inhibition of hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria by propolis would be beneficial to the animal. the extract containing the lowest amount of phenolic compounds (llos c3) showed the lowest antimicrobial activity against all the bacteria. the major phenolic compounds identified in the propolis extracts (naringenin, chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and artepillin c) were also evaluated on four sensitive strains.  only naringenin showed inhibitory effect against all strains, suggesting that naringenin is one of the components participating to the antibacterial activity of propolis.

TI  == effects of hop varieties on ruminal fermentation and bacterial community in an artificial rumen (rusitec).
AB  == background: there is a growing interest in the use of hops (humulus lupulus) as an alternative to antibiotics to manipulate ruminal fermentation. however, the effects of different hop varieties on ruminal fermentation and bacterial populations have not been studied. here the effects of three hop varieties, cascade (cas), millennium (mil) and teamaker (tm), at a level of 800 microg ml(-1) inoculum on ruminal fermentation and microbial populations in an artificial rumen system (rusitec) fed a barley silage-based total mixed ration were investigated. bacterial populations were assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction and expressed as a percentage of total bacterial 16s rrna gene copies. results: all hops reduced (p < 0.001) total gas, methane and the acetate:propionate ratio. liquid-associated fibrobacter succinogenes, ruminococcus albus and streptococcus bovis were reduced (p < 0.05) by mil and tm. feed particle-associated s. bovis was reduced (p < 0.01) by mil and tm, but tm and cas increased (p < 0.01) ruminobacter amylophilus and prevotella bryantii respectively. methanogens were decreased (p < 0.05) by mil in both liquid and solid fractions and by cas in the solid fraction. the total amount of alpha- and  beta-acids in hops affected the ruminal fermentation. conclusion: hop-induced changes in fermentation and microbial populations may improve energy efficiency use in the rumen. further research is needed to determine the effects of hops on  in vivo ruminal fermentation, microbial populations and animal performance.

TI  == rumen microbial population dynamics during adaptation to a high-grain diet.
AB  == high-grain adaptation programs are widely used with feedlot cattle to balance enhanced growth performance against the risk of acidosis. this adaptation to a high-grain diet from a high-forage diet is known to change the rumen microbial population structure and help establish a stable microbial population within the  rumen. therefore, to evaluate bacterial population dynamics during adaptation to  a high-grain diet, 4 ruminally cannulated beef steers were adapted to a high-grain diet using a step-up diet regimen containing grain and hay at ratios of 20:80, 40:60, 60:40, and 80:20. the rumen bacterial populations were evaluated at each stage of the step-up diet after 1 week of adaptation, before the steers were transitioned to the next stage of the diet, using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis, 16s rrna gene libraries, and quantitative real-time pcr. the t-rflp analysis displayed a shift in the rumen microbial population structure during the final two stages of the step-up diet. the 16s rrna gene libraries demonstrated two distinct rumen microbial populations in hay-fed and high-grain-fed animals and detected only 24 common operational taxonomic units out of 398 and 315, respectively. the 16s rrna gene libraries of  hay-fed animals contained a significantly higher number of bacteria belonging to  the phylum fibrobacteres, whereas the 16s rrna gene libraries of grain-fed animals contained a significantly higher number of bacteria belonging to the phylum bacteroidetes. real-time pcr analysis detected significant fold increases  in the megasphaera elsdenii, streptococcus bovis, selenomonas ruminantium, and prevotella bryantii populations during adaptation to the high-concentrate (high-grain) diet, whereas the butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and fibrobacter succinogenes populations gradually decreased as the animals were adapted to the high-concentrate diet. this study evaluates the rumen microbial population using  several molecular approaches and presents a broader picture of the rumen microbial population structure during adaptation to a high-grain diet from a forage diet.

TI  == biotransformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by pure culture ruminal bacteria.
AB  == twenty-one ruminal bacteria species were tested for their ability to degrade 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (tnt) within 24 h. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, fibrobacter succinogenes, lactobacillus vitulinus, selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus caprinus, and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with <5% of the original tnt recovered as diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. eubacterium ruminantium, lactobacillus ruminis, ruminobacter amylophilus, streptococcus bovis, and wolinella succinogenes were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with 23-60% of the tnt recovered as aminodinitrotoluene and/or diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. clostridium polysaccharolyticum, megasphaera elsdenii, prevotella bryantii, prevotella ruminicola, ruminococcus albus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens were able to degrade 80-90% of 100 mg/l tnt. desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans, prevotella albensis, and treponema bryantii degraded 50-80% of the tnt. anaerovibrio lipolytica was completely inhibited by 100 mg/l tnt. these results indicate that a variety of rumen bacteria is capable of transforming tnt.

TI  == the characterization of lactic acid producing bacteria from the rumen of dairy cattle grazing on improved pasture supplemented with wheat and barley grain.
AB  == aims: to identify and characterize the major lactic acid bacteria in the rumen of dairy cattle grazing improved pasture of rye grass and white clover and receiving a maize silage and grain supplement with and without virginiamycin. methods and results: eighty-five bacterial isolates were obtained from the rumen of 16 holstein-friesian dairy cows. the isolates were initially grouped on the basis of their gram morphology and by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the pcr amplified 16s rdna. a more definitive analysis was undertaken by comparing the 16s rdna sequences. many of the isolates were closely related to other previously characterized rumen bacteria, including streptococcus bovis, lactobacillus vitulinus, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, prevotella bryantii and selenomonas ruminantium. the in vitro production of l- and/or d-lactate was seen  with all but five of the isolates examined, many of which were also resistant to  virginiamycin. conclusion: supplementation of grain with virginiamycin may reduce the risk of acidosis but does not prevent its occurrence in dairy cattle grazing  improved pasture. significance and impact of the study: this study shows that lactic acid production is caused, not only by various thoroughly researched types of bacteria, but also by others previously identified in the rumen but not further characterized.

TI  == effect of a blend of essential oil compounds on the colonization of starch-rich substrates by bacteria in the rumen.
AB  == aims: to investigate the mode of action of a blend of essential oil compounds on  the colonization of starch-rich substrates by rumen bacteria. methods and results: starch-rich substrates were incubated, in nylon bags, in the rumen of sheep organized in a 4 x 4 latin square design and receiving a 60:40 silage : concentrate diet. the concentrate was either high or low in crude protein, and the diet was supplemented or not with a commercial blend of essential oil compounds (110 mg per day). the total genomic dna was extracted from the residues in the bags. the total eubacterial dna was quantified by real-time pcr and the proportion of ruminobacter amylophilus, streptococcus bovis and prevotella bryantii was determined. neither the supplementation with essential oil compounds nor the amount of crude protein affected the colonization of the substrates by the bacteria quantified. however, colonization was significantly affected by the  substrate colonized. conclusions: the effect of essential oils on the colonization of starch-rich substrates is not mediated through the selective inhibition of r. amylophilus. significance and impact of the study: this study enhances our understanding of the colonization of starch-rich substrates, as well as of the mode of action of the essential oils as rumen manipulating agents.

TI  == dominance of prevotella and low abundance of classical ruminal bacterial species  in the bovine rumen revealed by relative quantification real-time pcr.
AB  == relative quantification real-time pcr was used to quantify several bacterial species in ruminal samples from two lactating cows, each sampled 3 h after feeding on two successive days. abundance of each target taxon was calculated as  a fraction of the total 16s rrna gene copies in the samples, using taxon-specific and eubacterial domain-level primers. bacterial populations showed a clear predominance of members of the genus prevotella, which comprised 42% to 60% of the bacterial rrna gene copies in the samples. however, only 2% to 4% of the bacterial rrna gene copies were represented by the classical ruminal prevotella species prevotella bryantii, prevotella ruminicola and prevotella brevis. the proportion of rrna gene copies attributable to fibrobacter succinogenes, ruminococcus flavefaciens, selenomonas ruminantium and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were each generally in the 0.5% to 1% range. proportions for ruminobacter amylophilus and eubacterium ruminantium were lower (0.1% to 0.2%), while butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, streptococcus bovis, ruminococcus albus and megasphaera elsdenii were even less abundant, each comprising <0.03% of the bacterial rrna gene copies. the data suggest that the aggregate abundance of the  most intensively studied ruminal bacterial species is relatively low and that a large fraction of the uncultured population represents a single bacterial genus.

TI  == influence of dipeptidyl peptidase inhibitors on growth, peptidase activity, and ammonia production by ruminal microorganisms.
AB  == the aim was to investigate known and potential new inhibitiors of dipeptidyl peptidases (dpp) for their effects on ruminal microorganisms. gly-phe diazomethylketone (gpd), ala-ala chloromethylketone (aac), benserazide (dl-serine 2-(2,3,4- trihydroxybenzyl) hydrazide), and diprotin a (ile-pro-ile) inhibited dpp activities of prevotella albensis, p. ruminicola, p. bryantii, p. brevis, and mixed ruminal microorganisms, though incompletely and, except for diprotin a, without absolute specificity for any of the peptidases. leucine aminopeptidase activity of streptococcus bovis was also inhibited by gpd and benserazide. the inhibitors had no effect on the growth of the bacteria, except for gpd, which inhibited growth of p. albensis when only peptides were available for growth. benserazide had some inhibitory effects on the growth of megasphaera elsdenii and prevotella spp., even in the absence of peptides. the predatory activity of ciliate protozoa on bacteria was unaffected by dpp inhibitors. ammonia production from casein by mixed ruminal microorganisms was inhibited significantly (p < 0.05) by aac (29% inhibition) and benserazide (33%). it was concluded that dpp inhibitors can influence the rate of nh3 production in the rumen and may form the basis for developing protein-sparing feed additives for ruminants.

TI  == design and use of 16s ribosomal dna-directed primers in competitive pcrs to enumerate proteolytic bacteria in the rumen.
AB  == competitive polymerase chain reaction primers were designed for streptococcus, b. fibrisolvens, p. bryantii, eubacterium sp., prevotella, and a universal primer for the eubacteria. dna was extracted from rumen contents collected from eight dairy cows fed four diets: adequate nitrogen, adequate nitrogen plus carbohydrate, low nitrogen, and low nitrogen plus carbohydrate. b. fibrisolvens was significantly higher on the adequate nitrogen plus carbohydrate and the low nitrogen plus carbohydrate diets compared with the other diets, while p. bryantii was significantly higher on the low nitrogen plus carbohydrate diet compared with the adequate nitrogen diet. the population of eubacterium sp. was significantly lower on both the adequate nitrogen plus carbohydrate and low nitrogen plus carbohydrate diets. streptococcus populations were significantly lower on the low nitrogen plus carbohydrate diet compared with all three other diets, whereas there were no significant differences in populations of prevotella or total eubacteria on any of the diets.

TI  == the effect of condensed tannins from lotus pedunculatus and lotus corniculatus on the growth of proteolytic rumen bacteria in vitro and their possible mode of action.
AB  == five strains of proteolytic rumen bacteria were treated with condensed tannins (ct) purified from lotus pedunculatus and lotus corniculatus to investigate their effect on the growth of these bacteria in vitro. streptococcus bovis ncfb 2476, eubacterium sp. c124b, prevotella bryantii b14, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens h17c, and clostridium proteoclasticum b316t were tested against 200, 400, and 600 microg ct x ml(-1) extracted from l. pedunculatus and l. corniculatus. in the absence of ct, all bacterial strains showed typical growth and reached maximum optical density (od) after 6-8 h of incubation in a plant protein medium. growth  of eubacterium sp., p. bryantii, and b. fibrisolvens was inhibited (p < 0.01-0.001) more by the ct from l. pedunculatus than by the ct from l. corniculatus. all strains continued to grow in the presence of 200 microg x ml(-1) of the ct from l. pedunculatus, but attained significantly (p < 0.05-0.01) lower maximum od600 values than (minus ct) controls, except for s. bovis. at 400  and 600 microg x ml(-1), the addition of ct from l. pedunculatus inhibited (p < 0.05-0.001) the growth of all bacterial strains tested compared with controls. the growth of eubacterium sp. and p. bryantii was stimulated for the first 4-6 h  of incubation (p < 0.001) by 200 microg x ml(-1) of ct from l. corniculatus, but  then declined leading to a significant difference in od values compared with the  controls. at 400 microg x ml(-1), the ct from l. corniculatus reduced (p < 0.05-0.01) the growth of all strains except s. bovis, while 600 microg x ml(-1) inhibited (p < 0.01-0.001) the growth of all strains. to study the mechanism of ct action, the degradation of the large subunit (lsu) of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco; fraction 1 leaf protein) was followed after bacterial cells or rubisco were preincubated with ct  extracted from l. corniculatus and l. pedunculatus. both preincubations decreased lsu degradation, but they differed in their response to polyethylene glycol (peg) addition. addition of peg to ct-rubisco preincubations negated the effects of ct, while peg addition to ct-bacteria preincubations did not. this implies that the ct-bacterial interaction is stronger than the ct-rubisco interaction or the interaction is of a different type. also, l. pedunculatus ct reduced the degradation of the lsu to a greater extent than the ct from l. corniculatus when  preincubated with bacteria.

TI  == diet-dependent shifts in the bacterial population of the rumen revealed with real-time pcr.
AB  == a set of pcr primers was designed and validated for specific detection and quantification of prevotella ruminicola, prevotella albensis, prevotella bryantii, fibrobacter succinogenes, selenomonas ruminantium-mitsuokella multiacida, streptococcus bovis, ruminococcus flavefaciens, ruminobacter amylophilus, eubacterium ruminantium, treponema bryantii, succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, and anaerovibrio lipolytica. by using these primers and the real-time pcr technique, the corresponding species in the rumens of cows for which the diet was switched from hay to grain were quantitatively monitored. the  dynamics of two fibrolytic bacteria, f. succinogenes and r. flavefaciens, were in agreement with those of earlier, culture-based experiments. the quantity of f. succinogenes dna, predominant in animals on the hay diet, fell 20-fold on the third day of the switch to a grain diet and further declined on day 28, with a 57-fold reduction in dna. the r. flavefaciens dna concentration on day 3 declined to approximately 10% of its initial value in animals on the hay diet and remained at this level on day 28. during the transition period (day 3), the quantities of  two ruminal prevotella dnas increased considerably: that of p. ruminicola increased 7-fold and that of p. bryantii increased 263-fold. on day 28, the quantity of p. ruminicola dna decreased 3-fold, while p. bryantii dna was still elevated 10-fold in comparison with the level found in animals on the initial hay diet. the dna specific for another xylanolytic bacterium, e. ruminantium, dropped 14-fold during the diet switch and was maintained at this level on day 28. the concentration of a rumen spirochete, t. bryantii, decreased less profoundly and stabilized with a sevenfold decline by day 28. the variations in a. lipolytica dna were not statistically significant. after an initial slight increase in s. dextrinosolvens dna on day 3, this dna was not detected at the end of the experiment. s. bovis dna displayed a 67-fold increase during the transition period on day 3. however, on day 28, it actually declined in comparison with the  level in animals on the hay ration. the amount of s. ruminantium-m. multiacida dna also increased eightfold following the diet switch, but stabilized with only  a twofold increase on day 28. the real-time pcr technique also uncovered differential amplification of rumen bacterial templates with the set of universal bacterial primers. this observation may explain why some predominant rumen bacteria have not been detected in pcr-generated 16s ribosomal dna libraries.

TI  == effect of steroidal saponin from yucca schidigera extract on ruminal microbes.
AB  == the effects of steroidal saponins (sap) isolated from yucca schidigera extract on ruminal bacteria and fungi were investigated in pure culture studies. prevotella  bryantii, ruminobacter amylophilus, selenomonas ruminantium and streptococcus bovis were cultured through ten 24-h transfers in ruminal fluid medium containing 0 or 25 microg sap ml-1 (measured as smilagenin equivalents). the four strains, each non-exposed or pre-exposed to sap, were then inoculated into medium containing 0 or 250 microgram smilagenin equivalents ml-1 and 24-h growth curves  were determined. the cellulolytic ruminal bacteria ruminococcus flavefaciens, fibrobacter succinogenes and rc. albus were cultured for 72 h on whatman no. 1 filter paper in medium containing 0, 9, 90 or 180 microgram sap ml-1 for the determination of filter paper digestion and endoglucanase activity. the ruminal bacteria differed in their responses to sap. steroidal saponins in the medium reduced the growth of strep. bovis (p < 0.01 at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 h), p. bryantii (p < 0.05 at 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 24 h) and rb. amylophilus (p < 0.05 at 14 and 24 h), but the growth of s. ruminantium was enhanced (p < 0.05) at 10, 14  and 24 h. the growth curves of all four non-cellulolytic species were similar (p  > 0.05) between pre-exposed and non-exposed cultures and the concentrations of total sap and soluble (deglycosylated) sap in the liquid fraction were unchanged  (p > 0.05) over time. steroidal saponins inhibited the digestion of filter paper  by all three cellulolytic bacteria, but f. succinogenes was less (p < 0.05) sensitive to sap and more (p < 0. 05) effective at deglycosylating sap than were  rc. flavefaciens or rc. albus. transmission electron microscopy revealed that sap altered the cell walls of the sap-inhibited non-cellulolytic bacteria. the ruminal fungi, neocallimastix frontalis and piromyces rhizinflata, were cultured  on filter paper in medium containing 0, 0. 45, 2.25 or 4.5 microgram sap ml-1. filter paper digestion by both fungi was completely inhibited by 2.25 microgram sap ml-1. steroidal saponins from y. schidigera inhibit cellulolytic ruminal bacteria and fungi, but their effects on amylolytic bacteria are species dependent and similar to the effects of ionophores. as such, sap may be useful in nutritional applications targeting starch-digesting ruminal micro-organisms.

TI  == de novo synthesis of amino acids by the ruminal bacteria prevotella bryantii b14, selenomonas ruminantium hd4, and streptococcus bovis es1.
AB  == the influence of peptides and amino acids on ammonia assimilation and de novo synthesis of amino acids by three predominant noncellulolytic species of ruminal  bacteria, prevotella bryantii b14, selenomonas ruminantium hd4, and streptococcus bovis es1, was determined by growing these bacteria in media containing 15nh4cl and various additions of pancreatic hydrolysates of casein (peptides) or amino acids. the proportion of cell n and amino acids formed de novo decreased as the concentration of peptides increased. at high concentrations of peptides (10 and 30 g/liter), the incorporation of ammonia accounted for less than 0.16 of bacterial amino acid n and less than 0.30 of total n. at 1 g/liter, which is more similar to peptide concentrations found in the rumen, 0.68, 0.87, and 0.46 of bacterial amino acid n and 0.83, 0.89, and 0.64 of total n were derived from ammonia by p. bryantii, s. ruminantium, and s. bovis, respectively. concentration-dependent responses were also obtained with amino acids. no individual amino acid was exhausted in any incubation medium. for cultures of p.  bryantii, peptides were incorporated and stimulated growth more effectively than  amino acids, while cultures of the other species showed no preference for peptides or amino acids. apparent growth yields increased by between 8 and 57%, depending on the species, when 1 g of peptides or amino acids per liter was added to the medium. proline synthesis was greatly decreased when peptides or amino acids were added to the medium, while glutamate and aspartate were enriched to a  greater extent than other amino acids under all conditions. thus, the proportion  of bacterial protein formed de novo in noncellulolytic ruminal bacteria varies according to species and the form and identity of the amino acid and in a concentration-dependent manner.
