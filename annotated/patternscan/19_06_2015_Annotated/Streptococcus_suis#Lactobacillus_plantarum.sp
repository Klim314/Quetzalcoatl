TI  == high-level expression, purification and characterisation of porcine beta-defensin 2 in pichia pastoris and its potential as a cost-efficient growth promoter in porcine feed.
AB  == porcine beta-defensin 2 (pbd2), a recently discovered porcine defensin that is produced by the intestine, exerts antimicrobial activities and innate immune effects that are linked to intestinal diseases in pigs. here, we report a codon-optimised protein corresponding to mature pbd2 cdna that was expressed and  purified in pichia pastoris yeast. the highest amount of secreted protein (3,694.0 mg/l) was reached 144 h into a 150-h induction during high-density cultivation. precipitation followed by gel exclusion chromatography yielded 383.7 mg/l purified recombinant pbd2 (rpbd2) with a purity of ~93.7 %. two recombinant  proteins of 5,458.5 and 5,258.4 da were detected in the mass spectrum due to variation in the amino-terminus. the rpbd2 exhibited high antimicrobial activity  against a broad range of pig pathogenic bacteria (minimal inhibitory concentration [mic] 32-128 mug/ml); the highest activity was observed against salmonella choleraesuis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus suis (mic 32-64  mug/ml). however, rpbd2 also inhibited the growth of probiotics such as lactobacillus plantarum, bacillus subtilis and saccharomyces cerevisiae, but at lower efficacies than the pathogens. purified or unpurified rpbd2 also maintained high activity over a wide range of ph values (2.0-10.0), a high thermal stability at 100 degrees c for 40 min and significant resistance to papain, pepsin and trypsin. in addition, the activity of rpbd2 towards s. aureus was unaffected by 10 mm dithiothreitol (dtt) and 20 % dimethyl sulphoxide (dmso). our results suggest that pbd2 could be produced efficiently in large quantities in p. pastoris and be a substitute for traditional antibiotics for growth promotion in  the porcine industry.

TI  == lactic acid bacterial diversity in the traditional mexican fermented dough pozol  as determined by 16s rdna sequence analysis.
AB  == the lactic acid bacteria diversity of pozol, a mexican fermented maize dough, was studied using a total dna extraction and purification procedure and pcr amplification of 16s rdna for gram-positive and related bacterial groups. thirty-six clones were obtained and sequenced to 650 nucleotides. these partial sequences were identified by submission to the non-redundant nucleotide database  of ncbi. the identified sequences were aligned with reference sequences of the closest related organisms. this analysis indicated that only 14 sequences were unique clones and these were identified as lactococcus lactis, streptococcus suis, lactobacillus plantarum, lact. casei, lact. alimentarium, and lact. delbruekii and clostridium sp. two non-ribosomal sequences were also detected. unlike other environments analyzed with this molecular approach where many unidentified microorganisms are found, the identity of most sequences could be established as lactic acid bacteria, indicating that this is the main group among the gram-positive bacteria in pozol. use of this molecular method permitted detection of lactic acid bacteria different from those previously isolated and identified by culture techniques
