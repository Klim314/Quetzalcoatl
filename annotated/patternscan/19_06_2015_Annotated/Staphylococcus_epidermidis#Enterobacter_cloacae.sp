TI  == indolent infection in nonunion of the distal femur.
AB  == in the treatment of nonunions of the distal femur, infection should be excluded.  however, it is difficult to determine whether the nonunion is infected or not with negative history and signs of infection. the purpose of this study was to investigate indolent infection as a cause of presumptive aseptic distal femur nonunion. all presumptive aseptic distal femur nonunions treated from 1998 to 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. any patient with suspected of having an infection clinically was excluded. multiple tissue cultures were performed at the nonunion site. the main outcomes were to analyze the rate of positive cultures in presumptive aseptic distal femur nonunion and to compare the rate of secondary surgery in positive and negative culture groups. of the 22 patients, 3 (13.6%) had positive culture results. the organisms cultured were staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, and enterobacter cloacae. the overall rate of infection was 9.1% (2/22), and one patient underwent a secondary procedure. in the open fracture group, 2 of 10 patients (20%) had positive cultures; all developed infection. in the closed fracture group, 1 of 12 patients (8.3%) had positive culture results, but infection did not occur in the patient with a 3-week intravenous antibiotic treatment. the postoperative infection rate was 67% (2/3) in patients with positive intraoperative cultures, while 0% (0/18) in the group with negative intraoperative cultures (p<0.001). the presence of indolent infection can be verified in patients with presumptive aseptic nonunion of distal femoral fractures by obtaining intraoperative biopsy tissue cultures. positive intraoperative culture results were related with postoperative infection.

TI  == highly drug-resistant pathogens implicated in burn-associated bacteremia in an iraqi burn care unit.
AB  == objective: in low- and middle-income countries, bloodstream infections are an important cause of mortality in patients with burns. increasingly implicated in burn-associated infections are highly drug-resistant pathogens with limited treatment options. we describe the epidemiology of bloodstream infections in patients with burns in a humanitarian surgery project in iraq. methods: we performed a retrospective, descriptive study of blood culture isolates identified between july 2008 and september 2009 among patients with burns in a single hospital in iraq who developed sepsis. results: in 1169 inpatients admitted to the burn unit during the study period, 212 (18%) had suspected sepsis, and 65 (6%) had confirmed bacteremia. sepsis was considered the primary cause of death in 198 patients (65%; 95% ci 65-70) of the 304 patients that died. the most commonly isolated organisms were pseudomonas aeruginosa (22 isolates [34%]), staphylococcus aureus (17 [26%]), klebsiella pneumoniae (8 [12%]), staphylococcus epidermidis (7 [11%]), acinetobacter baumannii (6 [9%]), and enterobacter cloacae (5 [8%]). a high proportion of enterobacteriaceae strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and s. aureus isolates were uniformly methicillin-resistant. for gram-negative bacteria, the most reliably active antibiotics were imipenen and amikacin. conclusions: burn patients with sepsis in iraq were commonly found to have bloodstream pathogens resistant to most antibiotics available locally. effective empirical therapy of burn sepsis in this region of iraq would consist of vancomycin or teicoplanin and a carbapenem-class  antibiotic with antipseudomonal activity.

TI  == tolerability and efficacy of long-term treatment with daptomycin, ceftazidime and colistin in a patient with a polymicrobial, multidrug-resistant prosthetic joint  reinfection: a case report.
AB  == introduction: prosthetic joint infections are severe complications of joint implants. further complications arise when polymicrobial and/or multidrug-resistant microorganisms are involved. currently, there are limited data on the management of these infections and on the tolerability of long-term treatment with daptomycin, ceftazidime and colistin. case presentation: a 55-year-old caucasian woman who had a right hip prosthesis removed 1 year prior because of infection was admitted for prosthesis reimplantation. on admission at  our hospital, anamnesis regarding etiology and management of prosthesis infection was not available. on clinical, laboratory findings and imaging studies infection was not suspected. a hip prosthesis was reimplanted. at surgery, histopathological and microbiological investigations were not taken. three weeks  after reimplantation, surgical site infection due to enterobacter cloacae was diagnosed and oral ciprofloxacin was prescribed. four days later, a periprosthesis fluid collection was evidenced and a percutaneous needle aspirate  grew staphylococcus epidermidis and s. haemolyticus. enterobacter genome was also detected from the same sample. teicoplanin and meropenem were added to ciprofloxacin without clinical improvement. moreover, acetabular cup dislocation  was documented. she underwent prosthesis explantation, debridement, and positioning of an antimicrobial mixed spacer. from the intraoperatory cultures s. epidermidis and acinetobacter baumannii were grown. daptomycin, ceftazidime, colistin and rifampin were administered. four days later, rifampin was stopped due to a suspected liver toxicity. while undergoing therapy she presented recurrent episodes of wound dehiscence and on the 22nd week of treatment a further surgical debridement was performed, upon which the spacer was removed. at this time, intraoperative cultures resulted negative. three months later, after a total of 8 months, antimicrobials were interrupted. subsequently, a femoral transcondylar traction was positioned, and 3 weeks later a new prosthesis was reimplanted. at over 1 year after reimplantation she is well. conclusions: our findings suggest that microbiologic investigations are mandatory even when prosthetic joint infection is not suspected. molecular methods for identification of microorganisms can be used in addition to conventional cultures especially when patients are under antibiotic treatment. daptomycin, ceftazidime and colistin can be administered for several months without side effects. guidelines  specifically addressing the diagnosis and the management of polymicrobial, multidrug-resistant prosthetic joint infections need to be developed.

TI  == rapid detection of bacteria in urine samples by the "three-plug-injection" method using capillary electrophoresis.
AB  == this study explored a method that can rapidly detect bacteria in urine samples for the auxiliary determination of urinary tract infections (utis). urine samples from patients with utis (230 cases) were obtained using aseptic technique. the urine biochemical assay was then carried out using an automated urine analyzer for all the urine samples. bacterial species were identified by a combination of  bacterial culture technique, morphological observation and the bact-ist microbial identification/susceptibility analysis system. the most common seven species of bacteria in the study included escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. bacterial samples were suspended in sample buffer solutions and separated by the "three-plug-injection"  method using capillary electrophoresis (ce). each species of bacteria appeared as a bacterial peak. the mixture of the seven species also provided only one peak. further analysis showed that the concentration limit for the "three-plug-injection" method is 10(6) colony forming units (cfu)/ml, and there is a good linear relationship between the peak height and bacterial concentration (r(2)=0.99). the effect of urine composition on ce results was also investigated. the results showed that urine composition, i.e., proteins, white blood cells (wbcs) and red blood cells (rbcs), affected the peak retention time but could not affect the separation of bacteria. the results demonstrated that the bacteria in  urine samples can be detected within 10min by the "three-plug-injection" method using ce. the "three-plug-injection" method is therefore suitable for the rapid detection of organisms in clinical urine samples from utis.

TI  == internalisation potential of escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus in lettuce seedlings and mature plants.
AB  == the internalisation potential of listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium in lettuce was evaluated using seedlings grown in vermiculite in seedling trays as well as hydroponically grown lettuce. sterile distilled water was spiked with one of the four human pathogenic bacteria (10(5) cfu/ml) and used to irrigate the plants. the potential for pathogen internalisation was investigated over time using light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and viable plate counts. additionally, the identities of the pathogens isolated from internal lettuce plant tissues were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction with pathogen-specific oligonucleotides. internalisation of each of the  human pathogens was evident in both lettuce seedlings and hydroponically grown mature lettuce plants. to our knowledge, this is the first report of s. aureus internalisation in lettuce plants. in addition, the levels of background microflora in the lettuce plants were determined by plate counting and the isolates identified using matrix-assisted laser ionisation-time of flight (maldi-tof). background microflora assessments confirmed the absence of the four  pathogens evaluated in this study. a low titre of previously described endophytes and soil inhabitants, i.e., enterobacter cloacae, enterococcus faecalis, lysinibacillus fusiformis, rhodococcus rhodochrous, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus hominis were identified.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of schinus lentiscifolius (anacardiaceae).
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: schinus lentiscifolius marchand (syn. schinus weinmannifolius engl) is a plant native to rio grande do sul (southern brazil) and has been used in brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. material and methods: the crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, three gram negative bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: candida albicans, candida tropicalis, cryptococcus neoformans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two gram positive bacteria, namely, bacillus cereus, enterococcus spp, and six gram negative bacteria, namely, burkholderia cepacia, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis. results: the leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of schinus lentiscifolius showed a  broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (mic) against the tested bacteria and fungi. the n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against candida albicans (mic=25 mug/ml), candida tropicalis (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and cryptococcus neoformans, (mic=15.5 mug/ml). from the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of schinus lentiscifolius. conclusion: the antimicrobial activity and some constituents of schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. the results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.

TI  == surgical site infections following transcatheter apical aortic valve implantation: incidence and management.
AB  == objective: the present study was undertaken to examine the incidence and management of surgical site infection (ssi) in patients submitted to transapical  transcatheter aortic valve implantation (ta-tavi). methods: from april 2007 to december 2011, 154 patients underwent ta-tavi with an edwards sapien bioprosthesis (es) at the institut universitaire de cardiologie et pneumologie de quebec (iucpq) as part of a multidisciplinary program to prospectively evaluate percutaneous aortic valve implantation. patient demographics, perioperative variables, and postoperative complications were recorded in a prospective registry. results: five (3.2%) patients in the cohort presented with an ssi during the study period. the infections were all hospital-acquired (hai) and were considered as organ/space ssi's based on center for disease control criteria (cdc). within the first few weeks of the initial procedure, these patients presented with an abscess or chronic draining sinus in the left thoracotomy incision and were re-operated. the infection spread to the apex of the left ventricle in all cases where pledgeted mattress sutures could be seen during debridement. patients received multiple antibiotic regimens without success until the wound was surgically debrided and covered with viable tissue. the greater omentum was used in three patients and the pectoralis major muscle in the other two. none of the patients died or had a recurrent infection. three of the patients were infected with staphylococcus epidermidis, one with staphylococcus aureus, and one with enterobacter cloacae. patients with surgical site infections were significantly more obese with higher bmi (31.4+/-3.1 vs 26.2+/-4.4 p=0.0099) than the other patients in the cohort. conclusions: while ta-tavi is a minimally  invasive technique, ssis, which are associated with obesity, remain a concern. debridement and rib resection followed by wound coverage with the greater omentum and/or the pectoralis major muscle were used successfully in these patients.

AB  == background: statins have several effects beyond their well-known antihyperlipidemic activity, which include immunomodulatory, antioxidative and anticoagulant effects. in this study, we have tested the possible antimicrobial activity of statins against a range of standard bacterial strains and bacterial clinical isolates. methods: minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) values were evaluated and compared among three members of the statins drug (atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin). results: it was revealed that statins are able to induce variable degrees of antibacterial activity with atorvastatin, and simvastatin being the more potent than rosuvastatin. methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (vse), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre), acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus epidermidis, and enterobacter aerogenes, were more sensitive to both atorvastatin, and simvastatin compared to  rosuvastatin. on the other hand, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae were more sensitive to atorvastatin compared to both simvastatin and rosuvastatin. furthermore, most clinical isolates were less sensitive to statins compared to their corresponding standard strains. conclusion: our findings might raise the possibility of a potentially important antibacterial class effect for statins especially, atorvastatin and simvastatin.

TI  == nonrecovery of varying proportions of viable bacteria during spread plating governed by the extent of spreader usage and proposal for an alternate spotting-spreading approach to maximize the cfu.
AB  == aims: to elucidate the cause of high variations and inconsistencies in bacterial  cfu observed within and between different experiments while assessing viable bacterial counts through spread plating (sp). methods and results: following the  inconsistent results, cfu estimations were undertaken through conventional sp using the spreader, or a modified approach that did not use spreader employing four organisms. the latter approach involving spotting-and-tilt-spreading of inoculum on agar surface [spotting spreading (ss)] yielded higher cfu by 11-120%  over the weighted average depending on the organism and diluent. the adverse effect owing to the spreader was the most obvious in escherichia coli followed by staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter cloacae and bacillus pumilus. plate attributes that determined the surface moisture levels of agar medium and the spreading practice adopted by the personnel formed two other major influencing factors. plating for shorter periods (<60 s) using fresh 15/20 ml plates caused loss of 3-12% cfu owing to inoculum adhesion to spreader irrespective of glass or polypropylene make. on the other hand, prolonging the plating brought down the cfu significantly. spreader movement on agar surface subsequent to the exhaustion of free moisture, which was marked by the experiencing of some friction to smooth spreader movement, was detrimental to vegetative cells, while bacillus spores were less affected. conclusions: the study brings out that the way sp is carried  out exerts significant effects on cfu influenced by plate conditions. prolonged use of spreader on dry agar surface could be highly detrimental to bacterial cells. a mild use of spreader accounting for spreader-adhering inoculum or the practice of ss not involving the spreader is recommended. significance and impact of the study: this study unravels the effects owing to the spreader on bacterial  cells and the cfu and recommends an alternate approach of ss to minimize cfu inconsistencies and to maximize the viable bacterial counts.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of platelet (plt)-poor plasma, plt-rich plasma, plt gel, and solvent/detergent-treated plt lysate biomaterials against wound bacteria.
AB  == background: platelet (plt) gels exhibit antimicrobial activity useful for wound healing. the nature of the antibacterial component(s) is unknown. study design and methods: plt-poor plasma (ppp), plt-rich plasma (prp), plt gel (pg), and solvent/detergent-treated plt lysate (s/d-pl) from two donors were evaluated either native or after complement heat inactivation. materials were spiked at a 10% ratio (vol/vol) with approximately 10(7-8) colony-forming units/ml with four  gram-positive and four gram-negative bacteria of the wound flora. bacterial count was determined by plate assays at time of spiking and after 3 and 48 hours at 31  degrees c. bacteria growth inhibition tests were also performed. results: there was no viable escherichia coli colony for 48 hours after spiking to the plasma and plt materials from both donors, corresponding to greater than 7.51 to greater than 9.05 log inactivation. pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus were inactivated (approx. 4.7, 7, and 2 log, respectively)  3 hours after spiking to prp, ppp, or s/d-pl from the first donor but less (1.1,  4.6, and 0.2 log, respectively) in pg, before a regrowth at 48 hours in all materials. similar data were obtained with the second donor. no plasma and plt material had antimicrobial activity against enterobacter cloacae, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, and staphylococcus epidermidis. complement-inactivated samples had no antimicrobial activity. conclusion: plasma complement is mostly responsible for the activity of plasma and plt biomaterials against e. coli, p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and s. aureus. activation of the coagulation to prepare pg may reduce antimicrobial activity. these findings may help optimize the control of wound infections by blood biomaterials.

TI  == pathogen identification with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy: the effect of  bacterial and biofluid specimen contamination.
AB  == in this paper, the potential use of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (libs) for the rapid discrimination and identification of bacterial pathogens in realistic clinical specimens is investigated. specifically, the common problem of sample contamination was studied by creating mixed samples to investigate the effect that the presence of a second contaminant bacterium in the specimen had on the libs-based identification of the primary pathogen. two closely related bacterial specimens, escherichia coli strain atcc 25922 and enterobacter cloacae  strain atcc 13047, were mixed together in mixing fractions of 10:1, 100:1, and 1000:1. libs spectra from the three mixtures were reliably classified as the correct e. coli strain with 98.5% accuracy when all the mixtures were withheld from the training model and classified against spectra from pure specimens. to simulate a rapid test for the presence of urinary tract infection pathogens, libs spectra were obtained from specimens of staphylococcus epidermidis obtained from  distilled water and sterile urine. libs spectra from the urine-harvested bacteria were classified as s. epidermidis with 100% accuracy when classified using a model containing only spectra from other staphylococci species and with 88.5% accuracy when a model containing five genera of bacteria was utilized. bacterial  specimens comprising five different genera and 13 classifiable taxonomic groups of species and strains were compiled in a library that was tested using external  validation techniques. the importance of utilizing external validation techniques where the library is tested with data withheld from all previous testing and training of the model was revealed by comparing the results against "leave-one-out" cross-validation results. last, the effect of using sequential models for the classification of a single unknown spectrum was investigated by comparing the misclassification of two closely related bacteria, e. coli and e. cloacae, when the classification was first performed using the five-genus bacterial library and then with a smaller model consisting only of e. coli and e. cloacae specimens. this result shows the utility of using successively more targeted analyses and models that use preliminary classifications from more general models as input.

TI  == role of antibiofilm-antimicrobial agents in controlling device-related infections.
AB  == objectives: to assess the effects of n-acetylcysteine (nac) on organism viability in planktonic and biofilm phases, biofilm thickness, and extracellular polysaccharide content. methods: we performed time-kill curves and broth macrodilution assays of bacterial and fungal clinical isolates with varying concentrations of nac. we also created in vitro bacterial biofilms, incubated them with nac or control, and then stained with propidium iodide and fitc-labeled concanavalin a. we measured biofilm thickness, number of non-viable cells, and fluorescent intensity as a marker of extracellular matrix via a confocal laser scanning microscope. all experiments were conducted in triplicate. tested organisms included methicillin-sensitive and -resistant staphylococcus aureus (mssa, mrsa), s. epidermidis, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre), pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, candida albicans and c. krusei. results: nac 80 mg/ml was uniformly bactericidal (>99.9%  reduction) against all tested bacteria with no recoverable organisms after 30 minutes of incubation, but was fungistatic against candida species. minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of nac ranged from 5-10 mg/ml. biofilm thickness was significantly decreased in nac-treated biofilms for all organisms except vre. the number of non-viable cells in nac-treated gram-positive biofilms  was increased (p<0.05 for mrsa and vre). nac-treated gram-negative biofilms had scant cellularity and lacked complex 3-dimensional structures that were characteristic of controls. fluorescent intensity was similar in the experimental and control arms. conclusions: nac is bactericidal against clinically relevant and drug-resistant bacteria and also leads to biofilm disruption. nac has the potential for use as a novel agent for prevention or treatment of biofilm-related infections.

TI  == in vitro studies of a novel antimicrobial luer-activated needleless connector for prevention of catheter-related bloodstream infection.
AB  == background: we report in vitro studies of a commercially available novel antimicrobial luer-activated connector with the inner surface coated with nanoparticle-silver to prevent contaminants from forming biofilm and causing catheter-related bloodstream infection. methods: sterile control nonmedicated connectors and antimicrobial connectors were filled with approximately 1 x 10(5)  cfu/ml of staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or candida albicans; after 24 h of incubation, the numbers of remaining viable microorganisms were quantified and compared with the concentration in control connectors ( approximately 1 x 10(7) cfu/ml). in trials  simulating clinical use, septal membranes of connectors were inoculated with e. cloacae, were allowed to dry, and were then actuated and infused with lactated ringer's solution for 72 h, with sampling for microorganisms in downstream efferent fluid and for biofilm in the connector. results: microorganisms suspended in the intraluminal fluid path of antimicrobial connectors were rapidly killed. for 5 species, there was a 5.23-6.80 mean log(10) reduction (>99.999%), and with c. albicans, there was a 99.9% reduction. in clinical simulation trials, heavy contamination of downstream fluid was detected at all time points with control connectors, reaching approximately 1 x 10(5) cfu/ml at 72 h, and heavy biofilm was uniformly present; with the antimicrobial connectors, there was complete prevention of downstream fluid contamination and total absence of biofilm formation. conclusions: these simulation experiments show that needleless connectors readily acquire an internal biofilm when microorganisms gain access to the internal fluid path and that biofilm formation allows an exponential buildup  of internal contamination, with shedding back into the fluid path and downstream  sufficient to cause bacteremia. incorporation of nanoparticle silver into the lining surfaces of the novel connector kills microorganisms in the fluid pathway  and prevents internal biofilm formation, even with high levels of introduced contamination and continuous fluid flow. this technology deserves to be evaluated in a prospective, randomized clinical trial to determine its capacity to prevent  catheter-associated bloodstream infection.

TI  == maggot excretions inhibit biofilm formation on biomaterials.
AB  == background: biofilm-associated infections in trauma surgery are difficult to treat with conventional therapies. therefore, it is important to develop new treatment modalities. maggots in captured bags, which are permeable for larval excretions/secretions, aid in healing severe, infected wounds, suspect for biofilm formation. therefore we presumed maggot excretions/secretions would reduce biofilm formation. questions/purposes: we studied biofilm formation of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella oxytoca, enterococcus faecalis, and enterobacter cloacae on polyethylene, titanium, and stainless steel. we compared the quantities of biofilm formation between the bacterial species on the various biomaterials and the quantity of biofilm formation after various incubation times. maggot excretions/secretions were added to existing biofilms to examine their effect. methods: comb-like models of the biomaterials, made to fit in a 96-well microtiter plate, were incubated with bacterial suspension. the formed biofilms were stained in crystal violet, which was eluted in ethanol. the optical density (at 595 nm) of the eluate was determined to quantify biofilm formation. maggot excretions/secretions were pipetted in different concentrations to (nonstained) 7-day-old biofilms, incubated 24 hours, and finally measured. results: the strongest biofilms were formed by s. aureus and s. epidermidis on polyethylene and the weakest on titanium. the highest quantity of biofilm formation was reached within 7 days for both bacteria. the presence of excretions/secretions reduced biofilm formation on all biomaterials. a maximum of 92% of biofilm reduction was measured. conclusions: our observations suggest maggot excretions/secretions decrease biofilm formation and could provide a new treatment for biofilm formation on infected biomaterials.

TI  == antibiotic resistance patterns in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria causing septicemia in newborns in leon, nicaragua: correlation with environmental samples.
AB  == the aim of this study was to identify the bacteria causing neonatal septicemia in a neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) in leon, nicaragua and its relation with bacteria isolated from the environment at the nicu. our data showed that 74% (34/46) of the bacteria related to newborns with septicemia were gram-negative and highly resistant to beta-lactams (>85%) and aminoglycosides (80%), leading to treatment failure in 10 neonates with fatal outcome. although, the prevalence of  gram-positive bacteria (26%) was lower than gram-negative bacteria, staphylococcus epidermidis was related to the death of three newborns. no clonal  similarity was found among enterobacter cloacae , escherichia coli and serratia liquefaciens isolated from the neonates with septicemia and the nicu environment. however, in order to improve the outcome for neonates with septicemia, infection  control practices and appropriate empirical therapy should be considered to reduce the high prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing gram-negative bacteria isolated from neonates with septicemia (80%) and from the  nicu environment (34%).

TI  == isothiocyanate profile and selective antibacterial activity of root, stem, and leaf extracts derived from raphanus sativus l.
AB  == acetone and hexane extracts derived from the root, stem, and leaf of raphanus sativus were investigated for their antibacterial activity against foodborne and  resistant pathogens, such as bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, and escherichia coli. total and individual isothiocyanate (itc) components and their relationship with the antibacterial activity of r. sativus were also evaluated. both acetone and hexane fractions of root, stem, and leaf exhibited selective antibacterial activity against the organisms tested. antibacterial activity was strongest in the acetone fraction of root with larger zone of inhibition and lower minimum inhibitory concentration. the results obtained were comparable to that seen with standard antibiotics. of the different parts of r. sativus studied, root tended to be more active than the stem and leaf extracts in inhibiting the bacterial growth. gas chromatographic analysis revealed the presence of variable amounts of five different itcs such as allyl isothiocyanate (aitc), phenyl isothiocyanate (pitc), benzyl isothiocyanate (bitc), phenethyl isothiocyanate, and 4-(methylthio)-3-butenyl isothiocyanate (mtbitc) in different parts of the plant. the low linear correlation between the total itc content and antibacterial activity implied that bacterial growth inhibitory ability of r. sativus was not dependent on the total itc content. however, the antibacterial activity of r. sativus was well correlated with aitc, pitc, and bitc for all organisms except for enteroc. faecalis, whose inhibitory effect was more related to mtbitc.

AB  == the most frequent agents of severe bacterial infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns were determined in patients admitted to 45 italian hospitals over the years 2002-2003. the most common diagnoses were: sepsis (33.8%), pneumonia (9.4%), intravascular catheter-associated infections (9.3%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (8.1%). overall, 5115 bacterial isolates were identified from 4228 patients. three bacterial species, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli, accounted for more than 50% of the isolates. other prevalent bacterial isolates were staphylococcus epidermidis and  enterococcus faecalis, while acinetobacter baumanii ranked third among all intensive care unit (icu) isolates. 7% of s. aureus had intermediate resistance to vancomycin. although e. faecalis displayed no vancomycin resistance, 34% of vancomycin-resistant isolates were found among enterococcus faecium, one of the highest rates found to date, emphasizing the difference between these two enterococcal species. all the gram-positive pathogens were susceptible to linezolid, with the exception of approximately 2% of the enterococcal isolates that were intermediate with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)=4 microg/ml. almost 10% of escherichia coli, 14% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 22% of serratia marcescens and 50% of enterobacter cloacae were non-susceptible to cefotaxime. amikacin was the most active antibiotic against p. aeruginosa that showed lack of susceptibility to ceftazidime, gentamicin, piperacillin and ciprofloxacin ranging from 20 to 35%. finally, acinetobacter baumanii showed a high level of resistance to all the antibiotics tested including imipenem (58%). the results obtained in this study, the first of its kind in italy, offer indications for guiding empirical therapy and implementing specific interventions to fight antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and their transmission in the hospital  setting in italy.

TI  == ft-ir microspectroscopy for early identification of some clinically relevant pathogens.
AB  == aims: to investigate the potentials and limitations of fourier transform-infrared (ft-ir) microspectroscopy as a tool to identify, at the level of microcolonies, pathogenic bacteria frequently isolated in the clinical environment. methods and  results: a total of 1570 ft-ir spectra from 164 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients were recorded from 6 to 10-h old microcolonies of 50-150 microm size. a classification of 100% was obtained for the most frequent gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium at the species level. an average accuracy of about 80% was reached with gram negative bacteria from the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonaceae families; enterobacter aerogenes,  enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella spp., and citrobacter koseri; and proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. results were comparable with ft-ir measurements on dried suspensions from 18-h cultures. conclusions: early identification of young microcolonies is feasible with ft-ir microscopy with a very high accuracy for gram-positive bacteria. some improvement in the transfer of microcolonies is  necessary to increase the accuracy for gram-negative bacteria. significance and impact of the study: combination of ft-ir microscopy and multivariate data analysis could be a complementary, rapid, and reliable tool for screening and discriminating, at species and subspecies level, micro-organisms of clinical, food-borne, or environmental origins.

TI  == nature of bacteria found on some wards in sultan qaboos university hospital, oman.
AB  == this study aims to determine what objects lying in the hospital environment or brought in from outside contribute to the introduction of bacteria associated with nosocomial infections. one hundred swab specimens collected from children's  toys, sinks, door handles, telephone handsets and flowers brought into the hospital were plated on different culture media. colonial growth on the media was purified and identified subsequently using standard bacteriological methods. of the 100 samples cultured, 61 (61%) grew a range of bacteria including pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=14, 23.0%), acinetobacter spp. (n=13, 21.3%), serratia spp. (n=9, 14.7%), staphylococcus epidermidis (n=9, 14.7%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n=4, 6.6%), staphylococcus aureus (n=4, 6.6%), enterobacter cloacae (n=3, 4.9%), pantoea sp. (n=2, 3.3%), chryseobacterium sp. (n=2, 3.3%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1, 1.6%). although all the serratia, enterobacter, klebsiella and pantoea species isolates showed varying degrees of resistance to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime and cefotaxime, all were resistant to ampicillin. chryseobacterium and stenotrophomonas species isolates were resistant to amikacin, imipenem, gentamicin and ceftazidime, to which only three isolates of pseudomonas species were resistant. all the staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to methicillin. although there has been no major outbreak of a nosocomial infection in the hospital, it is strongly recommended that effective control measures (e.g., sampling the hospital water supply, disinfecting children's toys, use of appropriate hand washing and checking some of the disinfectants for presence of bacteria) are needed. these measures are necessary  to ensure that the antibiotic-resistant strains identified in this study are not  allowed to spread in the hospital.

TI  == elimination and multiplication of bacteria during preparation and storage of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: the prevalence of bacterial contamination of random-donor platelet concentrates (pcs) is considerably lower than that of blood donations. which key  steps of the preparation procedure contribute to the elimination of bacteria was  investigated. study design and methods: ten bacteria species were used. blood donations were spiked with bacteria and stored at 22 degrees c for 8 hours. the buffy coats were kept for 6 hours. pcs were prepared from pools of 4 buffy coats. at each preparation step and during pc storage, bacteria contents were measured.  in additional experiments, the titers of spiked blood and buffy coats were determined after storage at 20, 22, or 24 degrees c for 8 and up to 24 hours, respectively. results: enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica were completely inactivated during storage in blood or buffy coats. titer reduction was between 3.32 and 4.62 log. bacillus cereus, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis did not multiply. compared with their values in spiked blood the titers in the pcs were reduced by 1.7 to 2.8 log. klebsiella pneumoniae was the only species that grew in blood. with the exception of p. acnes, those species that were not removed by the preparation process multiplied in the pcs. remarkable donor-to-donor variations of the bactericidal activities of buffy coats were detected when the storage time was prolonged to 24 hours. conclusions: bacteria are significantly eliminated by the preparation procedure for random donor pcs. also, blood and buffy coats are bactericidal for  most species. when buffy-coat storage is prolonged, it cannot, however, be predicted whether specific strains vanish or multiply.

TI  == basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: flow cytometry (facs) is a common technique in blood banking. it is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. it was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (pcs).  study design and methods: plasma-reduced pcs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees c for various times. the following 10 species were used: bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica. bacterial dna was stained with thiazole orange. after the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by facs. results: all bacteria species used were detectable by facs. the lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microl, that is, 10(5) per ml. in general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. in one  case (k. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with  that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. when pc samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per ml of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees c, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. exceptions were e. cloacae and p. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. at 20 to 24 degrees c, the detection times were strongly prolonged. conclusion: sterility testing of pcs by facs is a feasible approach. the present  data suggest incubating pc samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees c before testing. for slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1  to 2 days.

TI  == pentadactylin: an antimicrobial peptide from the skin secretions of the south american bullfrog leptodactylus pentadactylus.
AB  == norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions were obtained from male specimens of the south american bullfrog, leptodactylus pentadactylus and shown to contain two peptides that inhibited the growth of microorganisms. the primary structure of a  previously undescribed peptide, termed pentadactylin, was established as gly-leu-leu-asp-thr-leu-lys-gly-ala-ala-lys-asn-val-val-gly-ser-leu-ala-ser-lys-v al-met-glu-lys-leu.nh2. the second peptide, which differs from pentadactylin by eight amino acid residues, is identical to fallaxin previously isolated from skin secretions of the caribbean mountain chicken frog l. fallax. pentadactylin inhibited the growth of reference strains of both gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus group b) but potencies were relatively low (mic values in the range 25-200 microm). the peptide showed very low hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (ld50>400 microm).

TI  == evaluation of bact/alert plastic culture bottles for use in testing pooled whole  blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich plasma platelets with a single contaminated unit.
AB  == background: in certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (plt)-rich plasma  plts can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. one prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single  unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 cfus/ml). this study evaluated the bact/alert (biomerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. study design and methods: bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single plt units (target, 10 and 100 cfus/ml; mean recovered, 5 and 92 cfus/ml) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 ml was plated (10 sets). results: all cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 cfus per ml. with b. cereus (< or =2 cfus/ml), all bottles were reactive. with k. pneumoniae and s. viridans (< or =3 cfus/ml), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. with s. marcescens (< 2 cfus/ml), only 7  of the 10 sets were reactive. with c. perfringens (0.2 cfus/ml), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. conclusions: this study evaluates the use of the bact/alert system for detection of bacteria in plt pools. overall, the bact/alert detected all contaminated pooled plts when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 cfus per ml with 10 different species of bacteria. low recovered concentrations (< or =2 cfus/ml) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of cs-023 (ro4908463), a novel parenteral carbapenem.
AB  == cs-023 (ro4908463, formerly r-115685) is a novel 1beta-methylcarbapenem with 5-substituted pyrrolidin-3-ylthio groups, including an amidine moiety at the c-2  position. its antibacterial activity was tested against 1,214 clinical isolates of 32 species and was compared with those of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, amikacin, and levofloxacin. cs-023 exhibited a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and -negative aerobes and anaerobes, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp), beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. cs-023 showed the most potent activity among the compounds tested against p. aeruginosa and mrsa, with mics at  which 90% of isolates tested were inhibited of 4 microg/ml and 8 microg/ml, respectively. cs-023 was stable against hydrolysis by the beta-lactamases from enterobacter cloacae and proteus vulgaris. cs-023 also showed potent activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli. the in vivo  efficacy of cs-023 was evaluated with a murine systemic infection model induced by 13 strains of gram-positive and -negative pathogens and a lung infection model induced by 2 strains of prsp (serotypes 6 and 19). against the systemic infections with prsp, mrsa, and p. aeruginosa and the lung infections, the efficacy of cs-023 was comparable to those of imipenem/cilastatin and vancomycin  (tested against lung infections only) and superior to those of meropenem, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime (tested against p. aeruginosa infections only). these results suggest that cs-023 has potential for the treatment of nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and -negative pathogens, including mrsa and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == in-house validation of the bactec 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: at present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the fda for the purpose of quality control (qc) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates: the bact/alert blood culture system (biomerieux) and the pall ebds (pall corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived plts. after the decision of the aabb to institute universal qc testing of plt concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the  performance of our current blood culture system, the bactec 9240, was carried out for this purpose. study design and methods: serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with plt contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis plt unit per organism. four ml of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (cfus) per ml was inoculated into blood culture bottles (standard 10 aerobic/f, becton-dickinson diagnostic systems) and incubated in a bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to  insure the identity of bacterial growth. results: with the exception of streptococcus mitis, the bactec system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 cfus per ml for staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the limit of detection for the  s. mitis test strain was 61 cfus per ml. detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis plt products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. conclusion: this study validates the use of the bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis plts in  less than 24 hours.

TI  == direct detection of bacterial pathogens in brain abscesses by polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing of partial 16s ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid fragments.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the feasibility of detecting bacterial pathogens directly  from the clinical brain abscess specimens by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification and sequencing of bacterial 16s ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rdna). methods: a total of 14 specimens were tested by both culture and pcr amplification, targeting the full-length or a partial region of 16s rdna. 16s rdna is known to be conserved in bacteria. sequencing of partial-length and full-length 16s rdna was performed. the sequence data were compared with known sequences of 16s rdna in the national center for biotechnology information genbank by using the basic local alignment search tool (blast) algorithm. the species with the best match of similarity were regarded as the pathogenic species in the samples. we also developed a streptococcus-specific multiplex pcr analysis for identifying members of the streptococcus species, the most common pathogen of brain abscesses. results: the 10 culture-positive specimens were all pcr-positive for partial 16s rdna, but only seven were positive for full-length 16s rdna amplification. bacterial dna was not detected in the remaining four specimens with a negative culture. species identification by phenotypes from culture was in agreement with that by sequencing results of partial-length (or full-length) 16s  rdna. the streptococcus-specific pcr analysis could detect streptococcus species  correctly in one step. conclusion: bacterial 16s rdna sequences provide reliable  clues to the identification of unknown pathogens. pcr analysis of 16s rdna and sequencing may identify pathogens to the species level directly from brain abscesses. this approach is rapid and is useful especially in the identification  of slow-growing and fastidious organisms.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16srdna oligonucleotide array].
AB  == objective: the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. however conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological  assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. on the basis of special gene sequence, pcr provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. but it is  difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic  agents. oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of  target genes. the objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the pcr product of 16srdna using a pair of universal  primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. methods: by comparison and analysis of the 16srdna sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. a pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight  species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. the probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of pcr  using the universal primers. results: the universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, neisseria meningitides, citrobacter freundii, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human dna as control. the results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could  not hybridize with other bacteria. the lowest concentration of dna (product of pcr) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. the results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. the results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. from the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common  infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. conclusions: despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system,  which contains amplification of the segment of 16rdna from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of pcr products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.

AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == newer carbapenems for urinary tract infections.
AB  == four carbapenems have been available clinically in japan. these are imipenem/cilastatin (imip/cs) and panipenem/ betamipron (pani/bp) of the older compounds and newer carbapenems such as biapem (biap) and meropenem (mero). the latter compounds are relatively stable to dehydropeptidase-1 (dhp-1) and have been reported to have higher antimicrobial activities compared to the earlier carbapenems. the antimicrobial activity of these four carbapenems against fresh urinary isolates showed high activities against enterobacteriacae such as serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and escherichia coli containing the class c-beta-lactamase- and extended spectrum beta-lactamase  (esbl)-producing strains compared to piperacillin (pipc) and ceftazidime (ctaz).  against pseudomonas aeruginosa, the carbapenems, with the exception of panipenem  showed strong antimicrobial activities compared to pipc and ctaz. high activities were also seen against enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, but methicillin-resistant strains were not affected.  the first generation carbapenems showed better activity against e. faecalis than  newer carbapenems. all four carbapenems were similar in clinical effectiveness in double blind trials for complicated urinary tract infections (utis). however, pani/bp is less effective in utis caused by p. aeruginosa than imip/cs. mero showed better eradication rate of p. aeruginosa than imip/cs. retrospective analysis of treated cases using carbapenems showed a rapid defervescence in the treatment of febrile complicated utis, which were mainly caused by mixed infection of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, especially those involving p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis.

TI  == validation of bact/alert plastic culture bottles for use in testing of whole-blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich-plasma-derived platelets.
AB  == background: bacterial detection of platelet (plt)-rich-plasma (prp)-derived plts  presents unique challenges for countries that do not allow pooling before storage. this study validated the bact/alert for use in testing pooled prp-derived plts with nine contaminating organisms. study design and methods: isolates of bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into two prp-derived plt pools (target, 10 and 100 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml; actual recovered concentrations, 5 and 90 cfus/ml). four milliliters of each postbacterial inoculation sample was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles and 0.5 ml was plated onto blood agar. results: all organisms (excluding p. acnes) were detected in 8.2 to 22.0 and 7.6 to 20.3 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively) and the mean time to detection was 15.0 and 13.1 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respective). p. acnes was detected with the anaerobic bottles in a mean of 74.9 and 64.3 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively). with e. cloacae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and s. viridans detection with the anaerobic bottles was faster or equivalent to the detection with the aerobic bottles. this was most notable with s. viridans where  the anaerobic bottle was reactive on average 21.6 and 10.8 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively) faster than the aerobic bottle. conclusions: this study validates the use of the bact/alert system for the detection of bacteria in prp-derived plts in a pooled format. overall, the use of the bact/alert system allowed the detection of pooled prp-derived plts inoculated with nine bacteria at 10 and 100 cfus per ml in 7.6 to 22.0 hours (excluding p. acnes).

TI  == evaluation of the uro-quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

TI  == the antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  == previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against gram- escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against gram+ micrococcus sp., is melanization. we examined the immune responses mounted by aedes aegypti towards gram- enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium, and gram+ bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial gram type and pathogenicity. these data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to  the immune response against prokaryotes.

TI  == peritoneal fluid titer test for peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis.
AB  == standard microbiological tests (i.e., mic) do not account for the unique factors  of peritoneal dialysis (pd)-related peritonitis which can significantly influence treatment response. our goals were to develop a peritoneal fluid titer (pft) test and to conduct a pilot study of its association with clinical outcome. the methodology was developed by using spent dialysate collected from patients with bacterial pd-related peritonitis prior to the initiation of antibiotics. dialysate was processed and spiked with antibiotic to simulate two standard intraperitoneal regimens: cefazolin plus tobramycin and cefazolin alone. thirty-six clinical isolates, including staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, were tested. in the pilot study, dialysate was collected from 14 patients with bacterial pd-related peritonitis. titers were determined by using each patient's dialysate and infecting pathogen. titers were  highly reproducible, with discrepancies in only 1% of cases. overall, pfts were notably higher against gram-positive bacteria (p < 0.0001). the addition of tobramycin increased titers significantly from zero to values of 1/16 to 1/64 against e. cloacae and p. aeruginosa (p < 0.0001). in the pilot study, peritoneal fluid inhibitory titers were significantly associated with clinical outcome, with a median value of 1/96 for patients who were cured compared to 1/32 for those who failed treatment (p = 0.036). in conclusion, this study provides preliminary support for the pft as a pharmacodynamic index specific to the treatment of pd-related peritonitis. with further characterization and validation in patients, the pft test may advance the study of antibiotic therapies for pd-related peritonitis.

TI  == neonatal bacteremia in a neonatal intensive care unit: analysis of causative organisms and antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  == background: infections cause significant mortality and morbidity in neonates, especially the premature ones. although there are various antibiotics can be used to combat neonatal infection, resistant strains have subsequently emerged. in an  epidemiological survey, we analyzed bacterial isolates and their antibiotic susceptibilities for cases of bacteremia in a neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) of a teaching hospital. methods: from november 1999 to october 2001, 623 neonates admitted to the nicu were enrolled. the incidence and incidence density of bacteremia, morbidity and mortality of sepsis, as well as antibiotic susceptibility, were investigated. results: totally, 754 blood cultures were done on 623 patients. fifty-eight patients experienced 85 episodes of bacteremia, with 87 isolates cultured. the incidence of bacteremia in our nicu was 9.31% (58/623)  with an incidence density of 10.98/1000 patient-days. the overall mortality rate  was 7.22%. the case fatality rate of bacteremia was 20.7% (12/58). the bacterial  pathogens encountered, in order of frequency, were coagulase-negative staphylococcus (29%), staphylococcus aureus (22%), and enterobacter cloacae (17%). all of the gram-positive bacteria were susceptible to vancomycin, while the gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to imipenem, amikacin and ciprofloxacin. oxacillin-resistant s. epidermidis, oxacillin-resistant s. aureus, and multi-drug resistant enterobacteriae were the leading microorganisms causing  bacteremia in our nicu. conclusions: it is an endless struggle to combat neonatal infection. periodic evaluation of bacterial antibiotic susceptibility is necessary. more judicious selection of antibiotics and rotating antibiotic regimens should be kept in mind to reduce the resurgence of multidrug resistant strains.

TI  == evaluation of a new generation of plastic culture bottles with an automated microbial detection system for nine common contaminating organisms found in plt components.
AB  == background: a microbial detection system (bact/alert 3d, biomerieux [formerly organon teknika]) has previously been validated with a variety of bacterial contaminants in plts. the recovery of nine organisms seeded into plts with new plastic culture bottles was studied in comparison to the current glass bottles. the use of plastic instead of glass would be expected to reduce the risk of injury. study design and methods: isolates of bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into day 2 (>24 hr <48 hr) apheresis plt  units to 10 and 100 cfus per ml. replicate samples (4 ml) were inoculated into both current- and new-generation standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles. results: all organisms (with the exception of p. acnes) were detected in a mean time of 9.3 to 18.9 hours (10 cfus/ml) or 8.7 to 18.2 hours (100 cfus/ml). in aggregate (with the exception of p. acnes), the plastic and glass aerobic bottles had a mean difference in detection of 1.2 hours (p < 0.0001), and the plastic and glass anaerobic bottles had a mean difference of 3.3 hours (p < 0.0001). in all cases,  the mean detection time was superior or clinically comparable (within 0.1 hr) with the new plastic bottles. p. acnes (an anaerobic organism) was detected with  the new and current anaerobic bottles in a mean of 72.8 and 90.4 hours (10 cfus/ml) or 64.0 and 80.8 hours (100 cfus/ml), respectively. the narrower bottle  neck and smaller inoculation septum present with the new-generation plastic bottles were inoculated with comparable ease to that of the glass bottles. conclusions: these data demonstrate that the new plastic bottles are clinically comparable or superior to the current glass standard aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles.

TI  == intestinal microflora in early infancy: composition and development.
AB  == the neonatal intestinal microbiota is a complex ecosystem composed of numerous genera, species and strains of bacteria. this enormous cell mass performs a variety of unique activities that affect both the colonic and systemic physiology. its primary activities include nutritive, metabolic, immunological and protective functions. most studies of infants have been based on faecal samples using the classical plating techniques with culturing on specific media.  the limitations of these methods must be taken into account when evaluating the varying results of the different studies. the establishment of the gut microbial  population is not strictly a succession in the ecological sense; it is rather a complex process influenced by microbial and host interactions and by external and internal factors. the climax intestinal flora is attained in successive stages. the foetal intestine is sterile and bathed in swallowed amniotic fluid. following delivery, multiple different antigens challenge the intestine of the newborn. the maternal intestinal flora is a source of bacteria for the neonatal gut. the bacterial flora is usually heterogeneous during the first few days of life, independently of feeding habits. after the first week of life, a stable bacterial flora is usually established. in full-term infants a diet of breast milk induces  the development of a flora rich in bifidobacterium spp. other obligate anaerobes, such as clostridium spp. and bacteroides spp., are more rarely isolated and also  enterobacteria and enterococci are relatively few. during the corresponding period, formula-fed babies are often colonized by other anaerobes in addition to  bifidobacteria and by facultatively anaerobic bacteria; the development of a "bifidus flora" is unusual. in other studies the presence of a consistent number  of bifidobacteria in infants delivered in large urban hospitals has not been demonstrated, whether the babies were bottle fed or exclusively breastfed. the predominant faecal bacteria were coliforms and bacteroides. according to these studies, environmental factors may be more important than breastfeeding in gut colonization after delivery. environmental factors are indeed extremely important for the intestinal colonization of infants born by caesarean section. in these infants, the establishment of a stable flora characterized by a low incidence of  bacteroides spp. and by the isolation of few other bacteria is consistently delayed. in extremely low-birthweight infants, hospitalization in neonatal intensive care units, characterized by prolonged antibiotic therapy, parenteral nutrition, delayed oral feedings and intubation seems to affect the composition of the intestinal microbiota. the gut is colonized by a small number of bacterial species; lactobacillus and bifidobacteria spp. are seldom, if ever, identified. according to the few studies so far performed, the predominant species are enterococcus faecalis, e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus. hygienic conditions and antimicrobial procedures strongly influence the intestinal colonization pattern.

TI  == [prostate histopathology of nih category iv prostatitis detected by sextant prostate needle biopsy from the patients with high prostatic specific antigen].
AB  == asymptomatic prostatitis is classified as category iv in nih classification of prostatitis syndrome (1999). no report concerning this category has been present. we investigated this category histopathologically and clinically, in order to clarify the histopathological distribution and its correlation to the clinical features, in this study. among 785 patients who were suspected prostate cancer because of their high prostatic specific antigen (psa) values and to have a sextant prostate needle biopsy was performed between january, 1996 and december,  2000, 88 patients (11.2%) were diagnosed as nih category iv prostatitis (asymptomatic prostatitis). we observed all pathological specimens stained with hematoxylin-eosine, and classified them into subtypes according to the classification criteria for prostatitis defined by true et al. (1999). we also investigated the relationship between histopathological distribution and clinical features such as psa values, psa density, the incidence of pyuria or bacteriuria. in the histopathological study, grade distributions were 12.5% (11/88) in mild, 71.6% (63/88) in moderate, and 15.9% (14/88) in severe. location distributions were 2.3% (2/88) in glandular, 68.2% (60/88) in periglandular, and 29.5% (26/88)  in stromal. no relationship between these subtypes and clinical features was recognized statistically. however, 7 patients (7.95%) were diagnosed as prostate  cancers, later. pyuria was found in 29.1% (23/79). bacteriuria was present in 14.3% (11/77). isolated bacteria were 4 strains of enterococcus faccalis, 2 strains of each of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, and one strain of each of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. gram positive rod, and candida sp. no relationship between these subtypes and bacterial species was recognized. these results indicated that the incidence of niii category iv prostatits was not low without correlation to any clinical features. however, we should pay attention to the presence of prostate cancer, because a small number of the patients were diagnosed as prostate cancer, later.

AB  == this prevalence study was conducted to compare the counts, types and antimicrobial resistance profiles of bacterial flora on the hands of individuals  in the community to that of nurses at a nearby university teaching hospital, with an intense hand hygiene regimen. hand cultures were obtained from 204 individuals during a home visit and 119 nurses in two neonatal intensive care units (nicus).  the mean total log counts of organisms were 5.73 and 5.24 for the homemakers [defined as the person (usually the mother) who is the primary person responsible for arranging childcare, cooking, cleaning etc] and nurse hands, respectively (p<0.0001). significantly more homemakers had acinetobacter lwoffii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. fluorescens/putida, and staphylococcus aureus on their hands compared with the nurses (all p<0.05). however, significantly more nurses had enterococcus faecalis, s. epidermidis, and s. warneri on their hands (p<0.05). of note, the hands of nurses harboured significantly more s. epidermidis strains resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and oxacillin and s. warneri resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, and oxacillin (p<0.05). surprisingly, significantly more trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant s. epidermidis and ciprofloxacin-resistant s. warneri was recovered from the hands of homemakers (p<0.05). this study demonstrates differences in prevalence, bacterial composition and antimicrobial resistance of hand flora of hospital personnel compared with homemakers. moreover, the hands of homemakers may serve as community reservoirs for antimicrobial resistant strains of clinical importance.

TI  == evaluation of antibacterial efficacy of drugs for urinary tract infections by genotyping based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge).
AB  == we attempted to determine whether the same bacterium isolated from patients with  urinary tract infections (uti) before and after treatment with antimicrobial agents was of the same strain ("persisted") or of a different strain ("changed"). furthermore, to verify the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents for uti, we investigated whether bacterial strains could be classified as persisted or changed based on their electrophoretic patterns in pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). we examined eight species of bacteria ( enterococcus avium, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas fluorescens, serratia marcescens,  citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and escherichia coli), consisting of 41 strains (19 pairs isolated before and after treatment with antimicrobial agents) isolated from patients with complicated uti. it was concluded that all bacteria were unchanged, based on the clinical effect on bacteriuria. the chromosomal dna of these bacteria was digested with restriction enzymes and classified based on their electrophoretic pattern in pfge. a comparison of the patterns of the fragments revealed that 14 pairs were indistinguishable before and after treatment, 3 pairs were closely related, 1 pair was possibly related, and 1 pair was different. these results demonstrated that 18 pairs of isolates (indistinguishable, closely related, and possibly related) were highly likely to be continued infections by the same strain, and that 1 pair (different) had been replaced by another strain. based on these results, we believe that bacterium genotyping by pfge is a more effective method  for evaluating the antibacterial efficacy of antimicrobial agents.

TI  == acidification of formula with citric acid is equally effective and better tolerated than acidification with hydrochloric acid.
AB  == objective: to determine whether acidification of formula with citric acid is equally protective against bacterial translocation and gut colonization but better tolerated than acidification with hydrochloric acid in neonatal rabbits. design: paired animal model with control. setting: animal laboratory. subjects: premature neonatal new zealand rabbit pups. interventions: a standard neonatal rabbit model in two versions, a bacterial challenge and a no bacterial challenge  model, was used to assess bacterial translocation and gut colonization. two hundred forty-six rabbit pups were delivered by cesarean section 1 day premature  and randomly placed into two groups sorted by type of formula acidification (hydrochloric acid or citric acid). pups were gavage fed ph 3 kitten formula every 12 hrs. ranitidine hydrochloride at 20 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) was added to all formula. bacterial challenge animals were given 1 x 10(6) colony-forming units/ml of enterobacter cloacae with the third feeding. animals in the no bacterial challenge group received no bacterial challenge. animals were killed on day of life 3, and the liver, spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, and cecum were sequentially harvested and cultured. organs were qualitatively judged for growth, whereas cecal cultures were quantified as colony-forming units/gram. stomach biopsies were performed to look for mucosal damage. long-term tolerance was assessed in 48 pups fed formula acidified to ph 3 with either hydrochloric acid or citric acid and 20 animals fed ph 7 formula without ranitidine. weight gain and mortality rate were followed for 14 days. measurements and main results: gut  colonization and bacterial translocation to liver, spleen, and mesenteric lymph nodes were equivalent between citric acid and hydrochloric acid in both bacterial challenge and no bacterial challenge models. long term, citric acid animals exceeded hydrochloric acid animals in daily weight gain and survival (p <.05 for  both) and equaled ph 7 animals in these measurements. conclusion: acidification of formula with citric acid is equally protective against bacteria but better tolerated than acidification with hydrochloric acid.

TI  == nb2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  == enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ecta) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. we present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ecta compounds, nb2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of nb2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) nb2001 is a substrate for tem-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/k(m)) of greater than 77,000 m-1 s-1. (ii) triclosan is detected in nb2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli but not in e. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) nb2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing e. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. nb2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae. nb2001 is also active against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae.  the results indicate that nb2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent  and demonstrate the potential of ecta in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.

TI  == [can we rely on the results of urine microscopy and culture when tests are performed in general practice?].
AB  == introduction: urinary tract infections (uti) account for 2-5% of consultations in general practice, but only about half the patients with dysuria have significant  bacteriuria (> 100,000 bacteria per ml). a microbiological diagnosis can be made  by examination of a urine sample, and in danish family practice the diagnosis of  uti is often reached by a microscopic analysis or a dip-slide culture test. these methods have a high validity when performed in hospital, but we need knowledge about the validity of microbiological urine examinations when performed in general practice. the aim of this study was to validate detection of bacteriuria  by urine microscopy and dip-slide culture in general practice. material and methods: urine specimens artificially produced by adding a known quantity of bacteria (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis) to sterile urine were sent  to 25 general practices for microscopic examination and dip-slide culture. no prior instruction in testing procedure was given. as the gold standard, the results of a standardised culture method performed by skilled laboratory technicians at the department of microbiology, university of southern denmark, were used. results: significant bacteriuria was identified by microscopy with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 83%. the corresponding figures for urine  culture were 95% and 96%. the morphology of bacteria was interpreted correctly in 80% of microscopic examinations, and 60% of the bacteria strains were classified  correctly in terms of their motility. discussion: the results of urine microscopy and culture performed in general practice are to be relied on.

TI  == fibrin sheath enhances central venous catheter infection.
AB  == objective: to determine whether fibrin-coated central venous catheters have a higher infection rate, and spawn more septic emboli, than uncoated catheters after exposure to bacteremia. design: animal study comparing catheter infection and blood cultures of fibrin-coated and uncoated catheters exposed to bacteremia. setting: animal laboratory. subjects: adult male sprague-dawley rats. interventions: a total of 210 rats had catheters placed with the proximal end buried subcutaneously. rats were divided into three groups: tail vein bacterial injection on day 0 (no fibrin group) or on day 10 (fibrin group), or no injection/saline injection (control, n = 40). bacterial injections were 1 x 108 colony forming units of either staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 100) or enterobacter cloacae (n = 60). animals were killed 3 days after injection. blood  cultures were obtained via cardiac puncture, and catheters were removed via the chest. half of the catheter was rolled onto agar and the other half was placed in trypticase soy broth. plates and broth were incubated at 37 degrees c for 48 hrs. the presence of >15 colonies on roll plates, or growth in broth, was accepted as  a positive sign of infection. microscopy was performed on day 20-10 catheters. thirty animals without catheters had bacterial injections and underwent blood culture 3 days after injection. measurements and main results: catheter infection with s. epidermidis occurred in 32% of roll plates and 80% of broth from the fibrin group vs. 4% and 20% from the no fibrin group (p <.01 for each). catheter  infection with e. cloacae occurred in 50% of roll plates and 80% of broth from the fibrin group vs. 0% and 12% from the no fibrin group (p <.01 for each). positive blood cultures occurred in 47 of 68 animals from the fibrin group vs. 8  of 68 from the no fibrin group (p <.01). microscopy showed a fibrin sheath on 20  of 20 catheters. without catheters, 30 of 30 blood cultures were negative. conclusion: the fibrin sheath significantly enhanced catheter-related infection and persistent bacteremia.

TI  == a decade of antimicrobial susceptibilities at the university of kentucky hospital.
AB  == objective: to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility rates for key antimicrobial agents and selective bacterial pathogens in the decade of the 1990s. methods: data from 1990 to 2000 from the university of kentucky clinical microbiology laboratory were analyzed by linear regression analysis to identify agents and pathogens that show a decline in susceptibility. for selected pathogens and antimicrobial agents, predictions were made for further declines in susceptibility for 2005 and 2010. results: significant declines in susceptibility to selected antimicrobial agents were found for pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. further declines were predicted for 2005 and 2010. conclusions: examination of susceptibility rates over time in a university hospital medical center provides useful data for future planning. in our institution, antimicrobial susceptibility rates have significantly declined during the 1990s for certain antimicrobial agents and bacterial pathogens. we are attempting to change our antimicrobial use patterns through formulary manipulation and clinician education, which may retard or prevent such declines in the future.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides isolated from skin secretions of the diploid frog, xenopus tropicalis (pipidae).
AB  == seven peptides (xt-1-xt-7) with antimicrobial activity were isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the diploid clawed frog, xenopus tropicalis. structural characterization of the peptides demonstrated that amino acid sequence similarity to antimicrobial peptides previously isolated from xenopus laevis was low, suggesting that the species are not closely related phylogenetically. peptides xt-5 and xt-3 are probably the orthologs of x. laevis  peptide glycine-leucine amide (pgl(a)) and the n-terminal spacer region of prolevitide, respectively. xt-1, xt-6 and xt-7 show limited structural similarity to the spacer region of x. laevis procaeruleins and the paralogs xt-2 and xt-4 are similar to corresponding regions of proxenopsin. orthologs of the magainins were not identified. the c-terminally alpha-amidated peptide xt-7 (gllgpllkiaakvgsnll.nh2) showed the lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations against reference microorganisms (staphylococcus aureus 5 microm, escherichia coli 5 microm, and candida albicans 40 microm) and was also active against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus group c, shigella sonnei, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae. the peptide was, however, hemolytic against  human erythrocytes (50% lysis at 70 microm). circular dichroism studies showed that xt-7 has a random structure in aqueous solution, ph 7.0 but adopts an alpha-helical conformation in the presence of 50% trifluoroethanol. decreasing the cationicity of xt-7 either by replacement of the c-terminal conh2 group by cooh or by deletion of the lys(8) residue produced analogs with greatly (>10-fold) decreased antimicrobial potencies.

TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. a total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the national taiwan university hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. for many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. some strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum  inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. moxifloxacin was less active against p. aeruginosa, but was more active against s. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. the drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in taiwan.

TI  == multi-resistance to antimicrobial agents for the ten most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens.
AB  == cross-resistance and multi-resistance to selected antibiotics was determined for  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. amikacin-resistant enterobacteriaceae often showed cross-resistance  to ss-lactam antibiotics. only 1% of the escherichia coli isolates showed resistance to more than four antibiotics from a set of seven. this rate was higher for other enterobacteriaceae and there were high levels of cross-resistance for p. aeruginosa. the cross-resistance of oxacillin with other  antibiotics is well known in staphylococci. penicillin-resistant pneumococcal isolates were cross-resistant to macrolides. cross-resistance was only a minor problem in h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis. cross- and multi-resistance are important problems for gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria but not for fastidious bacteria with the exception of penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

TI  == interaction of bladder glycoprotein gp51 with uropathogenic bacteria.
AB  == purpose: a major component of bladder surface mucin is a glycoprotein gp51 (molecular weight 51 kd.). gp51, which has previously been isolated from rabbit mucosa, appears to function as part of the defense mechanism in an in vivo infection model. gp51 coats the epithelium and is secreted into the urine, as detected by immunohistochemical testing and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). increased urinary gp51 occurs during urinary tract infection. to elucidate the role of gp51 as a component of the primary defense mechanism we studied interactions with uropathogenic bacterial isolates and urine from symptomatic patients with urinary tract infection. materials and methods: elisa was performed to demonstrate the binding of gp51 and various uropathogens. immunochemical studies were done using monoclonal antibodies to gp51 to determine the interaction of gp51 with certain uropathogenic isolates, including escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and streptococcus faecalis. infected urinary sediments and uropathogenic bacterial cultures were examined by immunocytochemical testing to localize gp51. antigen inhibition elisa was done to quantitate urinary gp51 in the urine of 17 normal controls and 19 patients with urinary tract infection. results: elisa revealed that gp51 binds to a wide spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative uropathogens in semiquantitative fashion. immunochemical methods confirmed that purified gp51 binds to bacteria, encapsulating and aggregating the bacteria. clinical specimens showed gp51 localized to bacteria and uroepithelial  cells. we observed a significant increase in urinary gp51 in urinary tract infection compared to uninfected urine (p = 0.0003). conclusions: these studies suggest that gp51, a component of bladder mucin, may be a strategic factor in the primary defense mechanism of the bladder.

TI  == ability of laboratories to detect emerging antimicrobial resistance: proficiency  testing and quality control results from the world health organization's external quality assurance system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  == the accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility data submitted by microbiology laboratories to national and international surveillance systems has been debated  for a number of years. to assess the accuracy of data submitted to the world health organization by users of the whonet software, the centers for disease control and prevention distributed six bacterial isolates representing key antimicrobial-resistance phenotypes to approximately 130 laboratories, all but one of which were outside of the united states, for antimicrobial susceptibility  testing as part of the world health organization's external quality assurance system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. each laboratory also was asked to submit 10 consecutive quality control values for several key organism-drug combinations. most laboratories were able to detect methicillin (oxacillin) resistance in staphylococcus aureus, high-level vancomycin resistance in enterococcus faecium, and resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins in klebsiella pneumoniae. many laboratories, particularly those using disk diffusion tests, had difficulty in recognizing reduced susceptibility to penicillin in an isolate of streptococcus pneumoniae. the most difficult phenotype for laboratories to detect was reduced susceptibility to vancomycin in an isolate of  staphylococcus epidermidis. the proficiency testing challenge also included a request for biochemical identification of a gram-negative bacillus, which most laboratories recognized as enterobacter cloacae. although only a small subset of  laboratories have submitted their quality control data, it is clear that many of  these laboratories generate disk diffusion results for oxacillin when testing s.  aureus atcc 25923 and s. pneumoniae atcc 49619 that are outside of the acceptable quality control range. the narrow quality control range for vancomycin also proved to be a challenge for many of the laboratories submitting data; approximately 27% of results were out of range. thus, it is important to establish the proficiency of laboratories submitting data to surveillance systems in which the organisms are tested locally, particularly for penicillin resistance in pneumococci and glycopeptide resistance in staphylococci.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the usa.
AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

TI  == target site concentrations after continuous infusion and bolus injection of cefpirome to healthy volunteers.
AB  == background: recent data indicate a higher level of effectivity of beta-lactam antibiotics if serum concentrations are kept above the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of the pathogen. this concept would favor continuous infusion over bolus dosing. however, it is usually not the serum concentration but the free interstitial concentration in the target tissue that determines antibiotic activity. we therefore set out to measure effective drug concentrations in the interstitial space of muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue and to compare trough levels and times above the mic after bolus versus continuous infusion of cefpirome. methods: twelve healthy volunteers received a single dose of 2 g cefpirome as an intravenous bolus or as a continuous infusion over 8 hours in a crossover design, and the resulting free interstitial tissue concentrations were  measured with use of microdialysis. results: after bolus injection, mean interstitial trough concentrations were 3.0 +/- 1.9 microg/ml and 2.1 +/-1.0 microg/ml for muscle and subcutaneous tissue, respectively; continuous infusion resulted in trough levels of 10.1 +/- 6.8 microg/ml and 10.1 +/- 4.6 microg/ml for muscle and subcutaneous tissue, respectively. this resulted in significantly  longer times above the mic with continuous infusion for staphylococcus epidermidis and enterobacter cloacae. bacteria with an mic < or =1 would be covered by either method, whereas higher doses seem to be necessary for pseudomonas aeruginosa. conclusion: although susceptible organisms will usually be covered sufficiently with standard dosing regimens, soft tissue infections with bacteria that have mic values of 2 to 8 may profit from continuous application. coverage of p aeruginosa, however, would be inadequate with conventional daily doses of 4 g cefpirome regardless of the method of application.

AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained during period from july 1996 to june 1997. the number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. a total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). from primary infections 162 strains were isolated,  and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. from primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was the highest.  in postoperative infections, the majority of them were enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were enterococcus avium. the isolation  rate of staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of enterococcus spp. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and enterobacter cloacae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like b. fragilis group and of aerobic gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. we found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither staphylacoccus aureus nor enterococcus spp.; however, the mic of arbekacin for one of strains of s. aureus  was 100 micrograms/ml. both the mic90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against p. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.

AB  == bacteraemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit. in this study the distribution of organisms causing bacteraemic episodes in patients in the adult intensive care unit of a large teaching hospital was determined. particular emphasis was placed on the type of organisms  isolated from community- and hospital-acquired bacteraemia, the suspected source  of infection, the possible risk factors associated with bacteraemia, and outcome. the incidence of bacteraemia and fungaemia increased from 17.7 per 1000 admissions in 1985 to 80.3 in 1996. a total of 315 episodes of bacteraemia and fungaemia were documented over a 12-year period, of which 18% were considered community-acquired and 82% hospital-acquired. gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 46.9% and 31.5% of the episodes, respectively. polymicrobial infection accounted for 17.8% and fungi for 3.8% of the episodes. staphylococcus aureus (22.5%), staphylococcus epidermidis (7.6%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (7.9%) were the predominant gram-positive bacteria implicated, whereas escherichia coli (6%), enterobacter cloacae (7%), klebsiella  aerogenes (3.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.1%), and acinetobacter spp. (3.8%) were the predominant gram-negative bacteria isolated. the two most common sources of infection were the respiratory tract (39.7%) and an intravascular line (24.5%), but in 8.9% of episodes the focus of infection remained unknown. bacteraemic patients stayed in the unit for a longer period (12 days) than did non-bacteraemic patients (3 days). the overall mortality related to bacteraemia and candidaemia was 44.4%. surveillance of bacteraemia in the intensive care unit is important in detecting major changes in aetiology, e.g., the increasing incidence of gram-positive bacteraemia, the emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in 1995, and the emergence of enterobacter cloacae. it is of value in determining empirical antimicrobial therapy to treat presumed infection pending a microbiological diagnosis and in directing the development of guidelines for infection prevention, e.g., guidelines for central venous catheter care.

TI  == role of antimicrobial-impregnated polymer and teflon in the prevention of biliary stent blockage.
AB  == biliary stent blockage and microbial colonization is a common complication associated with polyurethane stents used for the relief of bile-duct obstruction  caused by benign or malignant disease. in an attempt to overcome this problem the application of a 'teflon' (polytetrafluoroethylene) stent and an antimicrobial benzalkonium chloride (bzc) impregnated polymer were investigated. the effects of these materials on microbial colonization were compared to a polyurethane stent in vitro in broth or bile. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of bzc for three commonly isolated biliary stent pathogens, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecium and enterobacter cloacae were also determined. all the isolates were sensitive to bzc. the growth  kinetics of the three organisms in broth and in human pooled bile were similar. adherence to the bzc impregnated polymer was significantly reduced as compared to the polyurethane and teflon stents (p < 0.05) in nutrient broth. in bile, fewer organisms attached to the teflon as compared with the polyurethane stent (p < 0.05) for all organisms. for two of the three test organisms there was less bacterial adherence to the teflon than to the bzc impregnated polymer. the teflon and antimicrobial stent materials studied may prevent biliary stent blockage resulting from microbial colonization.

TI  == total nutrient admixtures appear safer than lipid emulsion alone as regards microbial contamination: growth properties of microbial pathogens at room temperature.
AB  == background: the extraordinary growth properties of most microorganisms in 10% and 20% lipid emulsions has led to the centers for disease control and prevention recommendation that if lipids are given through an i.v. line, the administration  set should be replaced every 24 hours rather than the usual 72-hour interval used for crystalloid solutions, including those used for conventional total parenteral nutrition. for nearly 15 years, parenteral alimentation has been given as a total nutrient admixture (tna), with the glucose, amino acids, and lipid mixed within the same bag and infused continuously over 24 hours. methods: we prospectively studied in a representative tna (17.6% glucose, 5% amino acids, 4% lipid; ph 5.6, osmolality 1778) and in a control solution, 5% dextrose-in-water (d5%/w), the growth properties at 4, 25, and 35 degrees c of three isolates each of staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, flavobacterium spp, and candida albicans, and two isolates of staphylococcus saprophyticus, the species that are most likely to contaminate tna during preparation or administration and that have been implicated in >95% of all outbreaks and sporadic cases of nosocomial bloodstream infections traced to contaminated parenteral admixtures reported in the world literature. results: growth in tna at 25 and 35 degrees c occurred with only two species, c. albicans  and s. saprophyticus, and only after 24 to 48 hours; d5%/w allowed growth at 25 degrees c of two gram-negative species, s. marcescens and b. cepacia. conclusions: we conclude that tna is a poor growth medium for most nosocomial pathogens and is no better than d5%/w. the need to replace administration sets every 24 hours with tna should be reconsidered and ideally be studied in a prospective randomized trial.

TI  == pancreatic fluid collections: diagnostic and therapeutic implications of percutaneous drainage guided by ultrasound.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of the present study is to assess the usefulness of biochemical and bacteriological analysis of the pancreatic fluid obtained at percutaneous drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts and abscesses guided by ultrasound. methodology: the study population was comprised of 65 patients, aged  21-79 years: 18 with abscesses and 47 with pseudocysts. in all cases the etiological factor of pancreatic fluid collections was acute pancreatitis. microbiological (both of aerobic and anaerobic flora), biochemical (including alpha 2-macroglobulin) and cytological analysis of aspirated fluid was performed. duration of percutaneous drainage in pseudocysts was 10-40 days (mean 18 +/- 12)  and in abscesses 21-56 days (mean 32 +/- 19). results: complete resolution of pancreatic fluid collections was obtained in 54 (83%) patients, among them in 40  (85.1%) with pseudocysts and in 14 (77.7%) with abscesses, which was confirmed in follow-up ultrasound and/or computed tomography one year after the catheter was removed. mild complications of this procedure observed in 17 (26.1%) patients were managed without catheter removal. a variety of organisms were cultured from  pancreatic fluid, e. coli being the most prevalent. enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, peptococcus saccharolyticus, propionibacterium acnes and bacteroides fragilis were also isolated. cytologic analysis of the aspirate revealed no atypical cells. the level of alpha 2-macroglobulin in the pancreatic fluid was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in patients with successful pancreatic drainage as compared to the remaining group.  conclusion: percutaneous drainage represents a safe therapeutic method that also  provides additional criteria for the management of patients with pancreatic cystic lesions.

TI  == reconstituted recombinant factor viii can be safely infused continuously for at least three days: it is a poor microbial growth medium.
AB  == reconstituted recombinant factor viii (fviiirec) loses little biologic activity at room temperature for up to seven days and continuous infusion is convenient, effective hemostatically and requires less fviiirec concentrate than treatment by conventional bolus injections. however, the potential for bacterial contamination, with proliferation to high levels that can cause bacteremia, is a  concern with continuous infusion. we studied the growth properties at 4, 25 and 35 degrees c in reconstituted fviiirec (kogenate) and at 25 degrees c in 5% dextrose in water (d5%w) of three isolates each of staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, flavobacterium spp. and candida albicans, species most likely to contaminate infusate during preparation or administration and which have been implicated in more than 95% of all outbreaks and sporadic cases of nosocomial bloodstream infection traced to contaminated admixtures, biologic agents or medications administered parenterally. reconstituted fviiirec allowed growth of only three species at 25 degrees c and 35 degrees c: s. marcescens, s. maltophilia and p. aeruginosa; logarithmic growth appeared only after 24-48 h. d5%w allowed growth of two gram-negative species, s. marcescens and b. cepacia. we conclude that reconstituted fviiirec (kogenate) is  a poor growth medium for most nosocomial pathogens, comparable with d5%w. if reconstituted aseptically, continuous infusion of reconstituted fviiirec should be safe, and it should not be necessary to replace the container or tubing more frequently than every 3 days, an administration schedule that can provide effective hemostasis at lower cost.

TI  == [bacteremia after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with and without therapeutic procedure: frequency, associated factors and clinical significance].
AB  == purpose: to determine the frequency, associate factors and clinical features of bacteremia in patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography  (ercp), with or without therapeutic procedures. methods: prospectively, 42 consecutives patients undergoing 46 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies (ercps) from august to december 1994 were analyzed. the search for bacteremia was done by drawing 6 blood samples for cultures from peripheral blood. two blood samples were collected before the ercp and 4 of them  after. the bottles used for cultures were bactec bottles. the bottles were incubated in the bactec 9240 system, and eventual bacteria detect were identificated by the manual routine of the laboratory and also with the autoscan/microscan system. results: all blood cultures obtained before the ercps  were negatives. bacteremia were detected after 7 endoscopic procedures. in two episodes of bacteremia, the microorganism identified (staphylococcus epidermidis) was considered to be a contaminant. the other 5 episodes of bacteremia were considered true bacteremia (frequency- 10.9%), and the microorganisms identified  were: streptococcus viridans, corynebacterium sp., enterobacter cloacae, klebsiello oxytoca and enterobacter aerogenes. this episodes were more frequent in the blood cultures obtained immediately after the ercps (p < 0.05), and occurred exclusively in the patients who were not receiving antibiotics (p = 0.0192). clinical manifestation of the episodes of bacteremia were not detected.  conclusion: the episodes of bacteremia occurred exclusively in the patients who were not receiving antibiotics, were transient and completely no symptomatic.

TI  == in-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of cfc-222, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == cfc-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. the in-vitro and in-vivo activities of cfc-222 were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and sparfloxacin. against gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus (quinolone-susceptible and quinolone-resistant), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis, cfc-222 was more active than ciprofloxacin and similar to  sparfloxacin. against gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, the in-vitro activity of cfc-222 was similar to that of sparfloxacin, but less than that of ciprofloxacin. however, it was less active than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. in mouse systemic infection caused by s. aureus smith or s. aureus tms 33, cfc-222 demonstrated an activity similar  to that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, but better than that of ofloxacin. the compound was more effective than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin in murine infection caused by streptococcus pyogenes atcc 8668. against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae infections, the efficacy of cfc-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin. the activity of cfc-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against p. aeruginosa mb4-16 in the same infection model. these results suggest that cfc-222 may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of various bacterial infections.

TI  == bacterial and ureaplasma colonization of the airway: radiologic findings in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  == objective: we designed this retrospective study to compare radiologic findings in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) in whom gram-positive cocci (gpc), gram-negative bacilli (gnb), or ureaplasma urealyticum were colonized. another objective was to correlate the radiologic findings of these patients with the clinical severity of bpd. study design: we correlated serial tracheal aspirates with radiographic findings from 183 infants whose birth weight was < or = 1250 gm. bpd severity was assessed by oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age (36 w pca) and at the time of discharge. two radiologists independently scored films taken at birth and 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days of life. results: of the study population, 55% were male and 35% were black; 80% received surfactant and 69% received dexamethasone; 91% survived. gpc isolates from throat cultures were mainly staphylococcus [corrected] epidermidis and streptococcus haemolyticus. a superimposed gnb colonization was present in 37% of these infants. most common isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and escherichia coli. sepsis caused by gpc developed in 16% of all patients; 7% had sepsis caused by gnb. infants infected with gnb remained receiving oxygen at 36 w pca and at the time of discharge twice as often as those noninfected. radiologic findings: hyperinflation, interstitial changes, and generalized or localized emphysema were prominent features throughout. mean radiologic scores increased over time in a pattern similar among gpc, gnb, and u. urealyticum infected and noninfected infants. high radiologic scores were not predictive at any time of infants who needed supplemental oxygen at 28 days and at 36 w pca. infants infected with u. urealyticum were neither clinically nor radiologically different than noncolonized neonates. conclusion: gpc, gnb, and u. urealyticum airway colonization is not associated with particular radiographic changes at any time. gnb-infected infants had the most severe bpd course, and yet they were radiologically indistinguishable from the other patients. u. urealyticum colonization does not result in more clinically severe bpd or demonstrate a unique radiologic course.

AB  == new pyrrolidine derivatives, which bear an alkyloxime substituent in the 4-position and an aminomethyl substituent in the 3-position of the pyrrolidine ring, have been synthesized and coupled with various quinolinecarboxylic acids to produce a series of new fluoroquinolone antibacterials. these fluoroquinolones were found to possess potent antimicrobial activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, including methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). variations at the c-8 position of the quinolone nucleus included fluorine, chlorine, nitrogen, methoxy, and hydrogen atom substitution. the activity imparted to the substituted quinolone nucleus by the c-8 substituent was in the order f (c5-nh2) > f (c5-h) > naphthyridine > cl = ome = h against gram-positive organisms. in the case of gram-negative strains, activity was in the order f (c5-nh2) > naphthyridine = f (c5-h) > h > cl > ome. the advantages provided by the newly introduced oxime group of the quinolones were clearly demonstrated by their comparison to a desoximino compound 30. in addition, the oxime moiety greatly improved the pharmacokinetic parameters of the novel quinolones. among these compounds, compound 20 (lb20304) showed the best in vivo  efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile in animals, as well as good physical properties. the mics (microgram/ml) of lb20304, compound 30, and ciprofloxacin against several test organisms are as follows: s. aureus 6538p (0.008, 0.031, and 0.13), methicillin resistant s. aureus 241 (4, 16, and 128), streptococcus epidermidis 887e (0.008, 0.016, and 0.13), methicillin resistant s. epidermidis 178 (4, 32, and 128), enterococcus faecalis 29212 (0.063, 0.13, and 1), pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e (0.25, 0.5, and 0.13), escherichia coli 3190y (0.008, 0.016, and 0.008), enterobacter cloacae p99 (0.008, 0.031, and 0.008), actinobacter calcoaceticus 15473 (0.063, 0.13, and 0.25). on the basis of these promising results, lb20304 was selected as a candidate for further evaluation.

TI  == microbial growth inside saline-filled breast implants.
AB  == in vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to determine whether intraluminal saline in breast implants can support the growth of common wound-infecting microorganisms over a prolonged period of time. the bacteria tested were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, corynebacterium jeikeium, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. three fungal species also were tested: aspergillus fumigatus, paecilomyces variotii, and candida albicans. in the in vitro study, four organisms survived in flasks of sterile saline for the 2 weeks in which serial cultures were performed: k. pneumoniae, c. albicans, a. fumigatus, and p.  variotii. in the in vivo study, 61 white rabbits (122 implants) received both an  experimental implant inoculated with one of the test organisms and a control implant containing only sterile saline. they were sacrificed at 1-, 3-, or 6-month scheduled endpoints. none of the control implants containing sterile saline had positive cultures. in contrast, the intraluminal saline was culture positive for 7 of the 10 inoculated organisms after varying lengths of time: s. epidermidis, e. coli, e. cloacae, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, a. fumigatus, and p. variotii. samples of capsular tissue also were cultured. of the 122 capsular tissue specimens, 21 (17 percent) had positive cultures and surrounded both inoculated and sterile implants. in most instances, capsules that were culture positive contained an organism different from the one that had been inoculated in the group. in only 3 cases was the same organism cultured from both the periprosthetic tissue and the intraluminal saline, and these may represent instances of the inoculated organism migrating through the implants filler valves. the data show that several types of bacteria (particularly gram-negative  species) and fungi can grow and reproduce in a restricted saline environment for  extended periods of time.

TI  == neonatal airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli: association with severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  == background: airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli (gnb) and gram-positive cocci (gpc) is common in mechanically ventilated neonates. whether  gnb are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (bsi) and/or to the severity  of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) is unknown. methods: we prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. data from 260 < or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated > or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. the severity of bpd was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. results: after 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with gpc (staphylococus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). superimposed on 36% of these infants was gnb airway colonization with klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), enterobacter cloacae (25%), escherichia coli (25%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), serratia marcescen (10%), acinetobacter baumannii and haemophilus influenzae (5%). comparison between 174 gpc- and 86 gnb-colonized infants showed  that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. fifteen percent of gnb-colonized infants developed bsi caused by gnb and 14% developed bsi caused by gpc. no significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and bsi was noted. gnb infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with gpc. gnb colonization was a predictor of severe bpd after controlling for ventilation. ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of gnb-colonized and 33% of noncolonized  infants and was not a predictor of bpd severity. conclusion: gnb airway colonization creates a moderate risk for bsi. antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate gnb. gnb airway colonization is associated with severe bpd, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate gnb from the airways should be undertaken.

TI  == evaluation of swirling, ph, and glucose tests for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: although infrequent, episodes of transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis may lead to serious outcomes or death and therefore are of concern. this study evaluates the sensitivity of three surrogate tests for the presence of bacteria in platelet concentrates: cessation of swirling, low extracellular ph, and low plasma glucose levels. study design and methods: day 0 platelet concentrates were inoculated with low levels of one of seven bacterial strains and stored with agitation at 20 to 24 degrees c for up to 5 days. in the morning  and afternoon of each day of storage, bacterial levels were ascertained by quantitative plate culture, and platelet concentrates were tested for platelet ph, plasma glucose, and swirling. quantitative and semiquantitative dipstick techniques were used to determine ph and glucose levels. results: platelet concentrates had attained stationary phase growth of streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus mitis, or staphylococcus epidermidis (> or = 10(7) -10(8) colony-forming units [cfu]/ml) before either the swirling or dipstick methods suggested the presence of bacteria. the sensitivity of swirling and glucose tests for detecting bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates was generally comparable. although the sensitivity of the ph test was generally similar to that of swirling and glucose tests for most bacteria, platelet concentrates contaminated with e. cloacae had normal ph despite the presence of high levels of bacteria (> or = 10(7)-10(8) cfu/ml). conclusion: the sensitivity in detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates by the swirling technique or by measuring extracellular ph or plasma glucose is less than the sensitivity reported for microscopy with gram stain (10(5)-10(6) cfu/ml), fluorescence microscopy with acridine orange stain (10(4)-10(5) cfu/ml), chemiluminescence detection of ribosomal rna (10(3)-10(4) cfu/ml), and automated bacterial culture (1 cfu/sample volume).

TI  == bacteremia in a pediatric hemodialysis unit secondary to enterococcus fecalis.
AB  == bacteremia is often a serious and recurring problem in children with hemodialysis catheters. we report an outbreak of enterococcus bacteremia in a pediatric hemodialysis unit occurring from june 1992 to june 1993. during this period, 18 episodes of bacteremia occurred in eight children; 11 infections were polymicrobial. enterococcus fecalis was associated with 13 infections in five patients (8 polymicrobial). other pathogens included enterobacter cloacae (5 infections), staphylococcus (3), staphylococcus epidermidis (2), and klebsiella pneumoniae (2). all enterococcus infections occurred in patients with dual-lumen  subclavian venous catheters. skin and catheter sites were culture negative, except in one patient. rectal swabs were positive for enterococcus in five patients. enterococcus was not isolated from any source within the unit. serotypes of all enterococcus isolates were different, except for 2 isolates in the same patient. starting in june 1993, catheters were flushed after dialysis with vancomycin or ampicillin. since initiating this procedure, further episodes  of enterococcus bacteremia have not occurred. a questionnaire sent to other pediatric hemodialysis units failed to identify enterococcus among 26 cases of bacteremia. in conclusion: (1) enterococcus is an unusual pathogen for hemodialysis-related bacteremia in children; (2) patients with dialysis catheters were predisposed to this infection; (3) a common source for enterococcus could not be identified by either culture or by serotyping; (4) flushing catheters with antibiotics after dialysis was effective prevention.

TI  == nosocomial bacteremia-induced increases in abscess formation correlate with in vitro upregulation of macrophage procoagulant activity.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the hypothesis that sublethal exposure to common nosocomial pathogens can alter the host response to a later, distant infectious insult (peritonitis and intraperitoneal abscess formation), and that these changes are related to the induction of macrophage procoagulant activity. design: a multiexperiment, randomized, controlled trial. setting: animal research laboratory of a university medical center. subjects: one hundred sixty-five balb/c mice, weighing 20 to 25 g, were used for in vivo experiments and as the source of peritoneal macrophages for in vitro experiments. interventions: nine groups of mice (n = 10 to 18 per group) were twice systemically preexposed to sublethal amounts of live escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, or candida albicans, or to 2.5 or 5.0 micrograms e. coli lipopolysaccharide o26:b6. one week later, mice underwent the induction of mixed e. coli/bacteroides fragilis peritonitis, leading to abscess formation. in parallel experiments in vitro, 10(6) mouse peritoneal macrophages were incubated with similar amounts of nosocomial pathogens or lipopolysaccharide to determine the induction of macrophage procoagulant activity. measurements and main results: the three gram-negative bacilli tested significantly upregulated both abscess formation and macrophage procoagulant activity, with a strong linear correlation between abscess formation and procoagulant activity. these effects were not seen with the gram-positive cocci or with c. albicans. pre-exposure of mice to endotoxin alone  did not alter later abscess formation, but did increase macrophage procoagulant activity. conclusions: sublethal exposure to some gram-negative nosocomial pathogens can significantly alter a host's response to a later, distant, infection, even when caused by different bacteria. in the case of peritonitis and intraperitoneal abscess formation, these changes may be mediated by the upregulation of macrophage procoagulant activity. the presence of endotoxin alone does not completely explain these phenomena.

AB  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. the advantages of in vitro activity of fk037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (mic90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (h-mrsa), (3) a strong activity against enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (mic90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for escherichia coli,  0.1 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for haemophilus influenzae and proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis and moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for c. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant s. aureus (l-mrsa), enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for h-mrsa and serratia marcescens.  fk037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except mrsa, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except p. vulgaris and/or m. catarrhalis. the increase in mics of fk037 against 2 l-mrsa strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. fk037 was highly bactericidal against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa at the mic or higher. fk037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against h-mrsa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. against the other strains, fk037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa. transmission electron microscopic  studies revealed that fk037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in mrsa after 4 h incubation.

AB  == platelet concentrates (pc) may be infrequently contaminated with low levels of bacteria that can cause septicemia and death in patients receiving transfusion therapy. we evaluated the efficacy of a photochemical decontamination (pcd) technique using 8-methoxypsoralen (8-mop) and long wavelength uv light (uva) to inactivate bacteria in standard therapeutic pc. twelve phylogenetically distinct  pathogenic bacteria, 5 gram-positive and 7 gram-negative organisms, were seeded into pc to a final challenge dose ranging from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. contaminated pc were treated with 8-mop (5 micrograms/ml) and 5 j/cm2 of uva, a pcd treatment regimen found to adequately preserve in vitro platelet function. greater than 10(5) cfu/ml of all 5 gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, and corynebacterium minutissimum) and 2 of the gram-negative (escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica) organisms were inactivated. the remaining 5 gram-negative organisms were more resistant, with less than 10(1) to 10(3.7) cfu/ml inactivated under these conditions. the inactivation efficiency for this resistant group of gram-negative organisms was improved when pc were resuspended in a synthetic storage medium with reduced plasma protein concentration (15%) and an increased 8-mop concentration (23.4 micrograms/ml). illumination with 3 j/cm2 of uva in this system inactivated greater than 10(5) cfu/ml of 4 resistant gram-negative organisms (salmonella choleraesuis, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and klebsiella pneumoniae) and 10(4.1) cfu/ml of the most resistant gram-negative organism (pseudomonas aeruginosa). this level of pcd treatment did not adversely affect in vitro platelet function. these results demonstrate that pcd using 8-mop (5 to 23.4 micrograms/ml) effectively inactivated high levels of pathogenic bacteria in pc with adequate preservation of in vitro platelet properties.

TI  == [an experimental examination of the significance of the peak antimicrobial concentration value in urine and time above mic on the effect of antimicrobial agents--an examination using a severely complicated in vitro bladder model with an autosimulation system for antimicrobial concentration in urine].
AB  == using a severely complicated in vitro bladder model with a computer-controlled autosimulation system for antimicrobial concentration in urine, we examined the significance of the peak concentration value and time above mic, and obtained the following results. 1. regarding the initial bactericidal speed, the higher the peak concentration value was, the more quickly the bacterial concentration decreased. 2. concerning the minimum value of bacterial concentration in the model bladder, the higher the peak concentration value was, the more the level tended to decrease. 3. regarding inhibition of regrowth of bacteria (ert) 1) when a particular antimicrobial agent had no pae on bacteria, the viable bacterial count curve was similar in cases of peak antimicrobial concentration values of higher than 8 mic. 2) on the other hand, when an antimicrobial agent had pae on bacteria, regrowth of bacteria occurred quickly below a certain peak concentration (24 mic or 64 mic value), although there was some difference depending on the type of antimicrobial agents. thus, it was suggested that the peak concentration above that level be attained and maintration above that level  be attained and maintained for some time were in order to obtain pae adequately.  4. it is concluded from the aforementioned facts that two factors, a certain high concentration and a certain continued time are necessary for both antimicrobial agent with metabolic disorder and antimicrobial agent with cell wall synthetic inhibition to obtain proper antimicrobial effect. the condition of their necessity differed slightly according to the two different agents.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates obtained in 1989 and 1990.
AB  == the in vitro activity of nine fluoroquinolones, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, fleroxacin and levofloxacin, and two earlier quinolones, nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid, against 1,346 bacterial strains isolated clinically between 1989 and 1990, was evaluated by agar dilution method. the bacteria studied were staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains), staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus species (including high-level gentamicin-resistant strains), escherichia coli, salmonella species, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and bacteroides fragilis. in contrast to the moderate to poor activity of two earlier quinolones, the fluoroquinolones acted well against most enterobacteriaceae and a. baumannii. the minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the drug strains (mic90s) were < 1 microgram/ml against most tested species. ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin  were more effective against multi-drug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. all fluoroquinolones assayed were very active against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, with mic90s < or = 1 microgram/ml. for methicillin-resistant strains, on  the other hand, the mic90s were > or = 4 micrograms/ml. there was no significant  difference in fluoroquinolone susceptibility between methicillin-susceptible and  -resistant s. epidermidis. sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more active against enterococci. most fluoroquinolones were relatively inactive against b. fragilis, with the exception of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin. the mic90s of most quinolones assayed against k. pneumoniae, citrobacter spp., e. cloacae, s. aureus and s. epidermidis were at least four-fold higher in our study. therefore, it is important for physicians to use fluoroquinolones carefully so as to prevent or delay the emergence of resistant strains.

TI  == in vitro experiments on catheter-related infections due to gram-negative rods.
AB  == although many complications may arise with the use of central venous catheters, catheter-related bacteremia is considered to be the most serious complication. microflora on the patient's skin (coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus) is thought to represent the major source of microorganisms causing catheter-related infections. gram-negative rods are increasingly observed as causative agents. we therefore performed an in vitro study to elucidate the pathogenesis of polymer-associated infections caused by enterobacteriaceae and nonfermenters and to study the resistance of polymer surface-grown gram-negative  rods against antibiotics. using a modification of the semiquantitative method for culturing vascular cannulas on solid media described by maki et al., we studied the adherence of various gram-negative rods to 1-cm segments of silastic catheters, a material used for port-a-cath-systems. organisms were obtained from  the american type culture collection (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae). all organisms but klebsiella showed extensive irreversible adherence. production of an extracellular slime substance was observed only with antimicrobially treated pseudomonas. after 'infection', the silastic catheter segments were treated with  various antimicrobial agents. the following antibiotics were used either individually or in combination: cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, fosfomycin and gentamicin. despite the fact that the antibiotic concentrations used were many times greater than the respective mics of the various antibiotics, none of the antibiotics tested succeeded in eliminating the organisms. e. coli was found  to be the most susceptible organism. these in vitro data substantiate our clinical impression that it is hardly possible to successfully eliminate the colonization of central venous catheters with gram-negative rods by using the antimicrobial agents employed here.

TI  == detection of bacterial contamination in cultures of eucaryotic cells by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
AB  == the use of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for early detection of bacterial  contaminations in cultures of baker's yeast, penicillium chrysogenum, and an animal cell line was evaluated; muramic acid and characteristic cellular fatty acids were used as analytes. by analyzing branched-chain and cyclopropane-substituted fatty acids as methyl esters, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis, lactobacillus reuteri, enterobacter cloacae, and  pseudomonas fluorescens were detected in a 500-fold excess (w/w) of baker's yeast; the amounts injected corresponded to 300 ng (dry mass) of the bacteria. contamination with bacillus was detected in cultures of penicillium chrysogenum and animal cells by analyzing muramic acid, both as its alditol acetate derivative, using electron impact ionization, and its trifluoroacetyl methyl glycoside derivative, using negative ion-chemical ionization. the trifluoroacetylated derivative was detected in injected amounts corresponding to  1 x 10(3) bacterial cells in the contaminated animal cell line, whereas amounts corresponding to 1 x 10(5) bacteria were required for detection of the alditol acetate derivative; the amounts in the original samples were 5 x 10(5) and 5 x 10(6), respectively. however, the alditol acetate method exhibited lower chemical interferences than the trifluoroacetyl methyl glycoside procedure. the results show the potential of using gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis of cellular constituents for the detection of bacterial contaminations in eucaryotic cultures as an alternative to conventional microbiological methods.

TI  == controlled clinical comparison of two lysis-based blood culture systems, isolator and septi-chek release, for detection of bloodstream infections.
AB  == a controlled clinical comparison was made of the isolator (wampole laboratories,  cranbury, n.j.) and the septi-chek release bottle (roche diagnostics, nutley, n.j.). from 6,345 blood culture sets fulfilling minimum criteria for volume of blood cultured, 840 strains were isolated, of which only 691 (82%) were considered to be representative of bloodstream infection according to centers for disease control definitions. statistically significant differences were found between the systems for the following organisms, which were all detected more frequently in the isolator system: staphylococcus aureus (p = 0.0001), alcaligenes xylosoxidans (p = 0.008), klebsiella pneumoniae (p = 0.05), salmonella spp. (p = 0.03), and candida albicans (p = 0.02). the septi-chek release system required a longer period of time than the isolator system for detection of the following organisms:s. aureus (p = 0.0001), enterococcus spp. (p = 0.0001), enterobacter cloacae (p = 0.03), escherichia coli (p = 0.0001), klebsiella oxytoca (p = 0.03), k. pneumoniae (p = 0.02), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p = 0.002), and c. albicans (p = 0.005). there were 430 episodes of bloodstream  infections identified in the study; of these episodes, only those due to s. aureus were detected significantly more frequently (p = 0.0001) by the isolator system than by the septi-chek release system. however, episodes of bloodstream infections due to s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus spp., and e. coli were detected significantly faster by the isolator system.

AB  == okpiye is a food condiment prepared by the fermentation of prosopis africana seeds. the traditional process for the production and microbiological characteristics of the condiment were investigated. during laboratory fermentation that lasted 96 h, the mesquite seeds underwent a natural fermentation that was characterised by the growth of microorganisms to 10(6)-10(8) cfu/g. several species of bacteria especially b. subtilis, b. licheniformis, b. megaterium, staphylococcus epidermidis and micrococcus spp were found to be the most actively involved organisms. however, significant contributions to the microbial ecology were made by enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae. lactobacillus spp were present in low numbers towards the  end of the fermentation. the presence of proteus and pseudomonas spp in traditional fermented samples demonstrate the variability which may exist in the  microflora of individual fermented samples. variations in the important microbial groups show that bacillus spp were the most prevalent species and occurred until  the end of fermentation. temperature, ph and titratable acidity varied with time  and were influenced by the metabolic activities of the microorganisms.

TI  == changing patterns of blood culture isolates from patients with acute leukemia: a  review of twenty years' experience.
AB  == during the 20-year period, 1972-1991, 286 episodes of bacteremia occurred in 200  (45%) of 445 patients with acute leukemia in a hematology ward, giving an incidence of 482 episodes per 1,000 hospital admissions. the frequency of bacteremia was almost unchanged throughout the study period. the frequency of gram-negative bacilli decreased significantly, however, from 81% of all the isolates for the first half of the study period to 50% for the latter half. despite the common use of ceftazidime and imipenem during the last 5-year period, pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in frequency to be the most frequent organism. this was opposite to the decreased frequencies of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. the isolates of p. aeruginosa obtained during this period, all of which proved sensitive to ceftazidime and/or imipenem, were almost equally distributed among five serogroups, although a temporal preponderance of a limited number of serogroups was observed during the preceding 15-year period. on the other hand, the frequency of gram-positive cocci increased from 9% in the first decade to 35% in the latter decade. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus species and, to a lesser extent, staphylococcus aureus  were ranked as major pathogens. among the recent isolates of s. aureus, methicillin-resistant strains virtually replaced methicillin-sensitive ones. therefore, until more effective means for control of p. aeruginosa bacteremia in  particular become available, the occurrence of this infection will continue to limit the successful treatment of acute leukemia.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime, the active metabolite of the new cephalosporin ester cefpodoxime proxetil, in comparison to cefixime, cefotiam, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime was determined against a broad spectrum of freshly isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. cefpodoxime was demonstrated to be inhibitory at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 90% of strains of moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli (beta-lactamase- negative strains), klebsiella spp., serratia spp., proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia spp., and salmonella spp.  this antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was generally superior to that of cefuroxime and similar to that of cefixime. cefpodoxime was active at less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 50% of the members of beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter spp., and morganella morganii. cefpodoxime proved to be highly inhibitory against group a, b, and g streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90 less than 0.015 mg/l). the mics of cefpodoxime and those of the other cephalosporins were less than 2 mg/l for greater than or equal to 90% of the strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, with the exception of cefixime which had no activity with mics below 8 mg/l against these bacteria. pseudomonas spp., acinetobacter spp., and enterococcus spp. were resistant to cefpodoxime. the antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime was only to a minor degree influenced by different growth conditions with the exception of high inoculum sizes against some beta-lactamase producing strains of gram-negative bacilli.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == in vitro activity of cefcanel versus other oral cephalosporins.
AB  == cefcanel is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. its activity was compared with that of cefuroxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, and cefixime against gram-positive and  negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. cefcanel had excellent activity against  methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, mic90 1 micrograms/ml, superior to the other oral cephalosporins. however, methicillin-resistant staphylococci were resistant, mic greater than or equal to  16 micrograms/ml. streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.015-1 micrograms/ml, concentrations comparable to other cephalosporins. clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.25 micrograms/ml, 8- to 128-fold lower concentrations than were found for other agents, but the mics were greater than 64 micrograms/ml for bacteroides spp. the mic90 for moraxella catarrhalis was 1 micrograms/ml, similar to cefuroxime but 16-fold greater than the mics of cefixime. escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumonia which were high beta-lactamase producers were resistant, mics greater than 64 micrograms/ml, and  50% of enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii were resistant. cefcanel was hydrolyzed by tem-1, tem-3 and moraxella bro-1 beta-lactamases. escherichia coli  containing tem-1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 had cefcanel mics of greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. although cefcanel inhibited gram-positive species as well as or at lower concentrations than other cephalosporins, it lacked activity against gram-negative species that produced common plasmid beta-lactamase although it inhibited haemophilus influenzae carrying tem-1.

TI  == in vitro activity of an oxycephem ocp 9-176 compared with its sulfur analog and other beta-lactams.
AB  == ocp 9-176 is an oxycephem antibiotic that contains a 2-aminothiazolyl, carboxypropyl side chain at c-7 and a pyridinium thiomethyl group at c-3. ocp 9-176 was generally twofold less active than its sulfur-containing analog me 1228 against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, providencia  stuartii, proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens. activity against enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii was equivalent. ocp 9-176 was twofold less active than me-1228 against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter species. activity of the two agents was similar against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. although ocp 9-176 inhibited e. coli containing tem-1 and tem-2, it was less active than me-1228. klebsiella organisms with shv-1 and k-2 beta-lactamases were inhibited, but tem-3-containing isolates had mics of 16  micrograms/ml. ocp 9-176 was minimally hydrolyzed by tem-1, pse-1, k-1, and p99,  and it was a poor inhibitor of p99. replacement of sulfur with oxygen does not increase the activity of compounds with sulfopyridinium methyl groups at c-3.

TI  == three-year experience with sonicated vascular catheter cultures in a clinical microbiology laboratory.
AB  == using a quantitative sonication method, we cultured 1,681 consecutive vascular catheters submitted to a clinical microbiology laboratory in a 36-month period. a total of 46% of the cultures were positive; the most common organisms isolated were coagulase-negative staphylococci (36.4%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.9%), enterococci (10.0%), yeasts (9.2%), staphylococcus aureus (5.8%), and enterobacter species (4.4%). the frequencies of positive blood cultures within 48 h prior to a positive catheter culture result were as follows: candida albicans (68.4%), s. aureus (60%), enterobacter cloacae (42.9%), staphylococcus epidermidis (32.1%), p. aeruginosa (27.7%), and enterococci (23.3%). the sonication method allowed quantification of the number of cfu removed from a catheter for between 10(2) and 10(7) cfu. for catheter cultures in which greater  than or equal to 10(2) cfu grew, a linear regression equation could be calculated: (risk of positive blood culture for the same organism) = 14 [log10 (number of organisms removed from the catheter)] -21 (r = 0.93). for catheter cultures in which less than 10(2) cfu grew, positive blood cultures for the same  organism were strongly associated with a proven infection at a site distant from  the catheter (p = 0.001) or probable contamination (s. epidermidis). our findings indicate that this technique has considerable potential for use in clinical microbiology laboratories to aid in the diagnosis of vascular catheter infections and for clinical investigations into the pathogenesis of these infections.

TI  == purification, composition, and activity of two bactenecins, antibacterial peptides of bovine neutrophils.
AB  == extracts of granules of bovine neutrophils are known to exhibit a marked antibacterial activity in vitro. by a simple, two-step chromatographic procedure, we have resolved two peptide components of the antibacterial system. they were named bac-5 and bac-7 from the general term bactenecin and had molecular masses of about 5 and 7 kilodaltons, respectively. over 45 and 20% of the amino acid residues in the two bactenecins are proline and arginine, respectively. the remaining amino acids are mainly hydrophobic (isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine). both bac-5 and bac-7 efficiently kill escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, and klebsiella pneumoniae. they also arrest the growth of enterobacter cloacae (mics, 25 to 200 micrograms/ml) but not of proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae (mic, greater than 200 micrograms/ml). finally, bac-7 but not bac-5 has mics of less than or equal to 200 micrograms/ml for pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis. from the comparison between the efficient bactericidal concentrations in vitro and the estimated content of bactenecins in neutrophils (125 ng of bac-5 and bac-7 each per 10(6) cells), it is reasonable to conclude that the two cationic peptides may exert a major role in host defense against at least some microorganisms.

AB  == the prevalence of clinical bacteria, as isolated from linko chang-gung memorial hospital (2,300 beds) in the period january 1985 to december 1986 and from taipei veterans general hospital (2,300 beds) during the period january 1986 to december 1986, was analyzed with the following findings: (i) the isolation ratio of anaerobic and aerobic or facultative bactria during the period of investigation were 7.8% (5,513/70,799) and 92.2% (65,286/70,799), respectively. (ii) of the total aerobic or facultative isolates from the two hospitals, 32.9% (21,510/65,286) were gram positive cocci and bacilli, 67.1% (43,776/65,286) were  gram negative cocci and bacilli. (iii) of these gram-negative bacilli, 65.2% (28,490/43,675) were enterobacteriaceae were enterobacteriaceae and glucose fermentative gram negative bacilli, 32.0% (13,984/43,675) were glucose nonfermentative gram negative bacilli, and 2.7% (1,200/43,675) were fastidious gram negative bacilli. (iv) the more common species among the members of enterobacteriaceae were escherichia coli 35.7% (10,163/28,490), and klebsiella pneumoniae 18.2% (5,186/28,490). the other common species included enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii and proteus vulgaris. the frequencies of salmonella species and shigella species in these two large hospitals were up to 1.6% (456/28,490) and 0.5% (149/28,490), respectively. the most common isolate among other glucose fermentative gram negative bacilli was aeromonas hydrophila 3.0% (843/28,490). the finding of 0.1% (11/28,490) vibrio alginolyticus was considered as clinically significant in taiwan. (v) of these glucose nonfermentative gram negative bacilli, 69.4% (9,704/13,984) were pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18.9% (2,637/13,984) acinetobacter species, 10.8% (1,516/13,984) pseudomonas species. (vi) the most common bacteria among fastidious gram negative bacilli was haemophilus influenzae, 96.2% (1,154/1,200). (vii) of these gram negative cocci, 59.4% (60/101) was neisseria gonorrhoeae and 6.9% (7/101) n. meningitidis. (viii) the more common isolates of gram positive bacilli included bacillus species and corynebacterium species (diphtheroids). (ix) of these gram positive cocci, the isolation rates of staphylococcus species and streptococcus species were 54.6% (10,838/19,827) and 45.4% (9,002/19,847), respectively. the most common isolate among gram positive cocci was staphylococcus aureus, 30.2% (5,994/19,847); the next, enterococcus, 24.9% (4,936/19,847); then s. epidermidis, 22.2% (4,390/19,847). the less common isolates were streptococcus pyogenes 1.1% (212/19,847) and s. pneumoniae, 1.7% (329/19,847).(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == the microbial ecology of soybean soaking for tempe production.
AB  == soybeans soaked in tap water for 24 to 36 h at 20, 30 or 37 degrees c underwent a natural fermentation that was characterized by the growth of microorganisms to 10(8)-10(10) cfu/ml (depending on temperature) and a reduction of ph from 6.5 to  4.5. lactobacillus casei, streptococcus faecium, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus dysgalactiae dominated the fermentation but, significant contributions were also made by klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella ozaenae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter agglomerans, citrobacter diversus and bacillus brevis, and the yeasts pichia burtonii, candida didensiae and rhodotorula rubra.  fermentation of surface-decontaminated beans in sterile water with pure cultures  of these isolates showed l. casei, strep. faecium and staph. epidermidis to be the main species responsible for the ph reduction. soybeans were the main source  of microorganisms for the fermentation. boiled beans did not undergo an acid fermentation.

TI  == clinical safety and efficacy of ofloxacin.
AB  == in this study we report about the efficacy and tolerability of ofloxacin in the treatment of 15 patients with severe and moderately severe infections including osteomyelitis (5), soft tissue infections (5), salmonellosis in aids patients (2), acute or chronic pulmonary infections (2) and mediastinitis (1). the following organisms were isolated in culture specimens: staphylococcus aureus (4), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), staphylococcus epidermidis (3), serratia marcescens (1), escherichia coli (1), aeromonas hydrophila (1), klebsiella oxytoca (1), klebsiella pneumoniae (1), salmonella cholerae-suis (1), salmonella  sp. (1), enterobacter cloacae (1). all isolates were sensitive to the drug. of 5  cases with osteomyelitis, 2 were cured and 3 improved clinically (with bacteriological eradication of the pathogens). the best results were obtained in  patients with soft tissue infections: 4 patients were cured and 1 improved. two patients with salmonella bacteremia and aids experienced a recurrence 1 month and 2 months respectively after stopping therapy. the patient with mediastinitis was  successfully treated. improvement was recorded for 2 patients with bronchiectasis and exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. the drug was well tolerated, only one episode of mild nausea and vomiting was reported and did not require discontinuation of the therapy. the study indicates that ofloxacin is a safe and  effective agent in the treatment of various infections.

TI  == bacteremia complicating acute leukemia with special reference to its incidence and changing etiological patterns.
AB  == over the 15-yr period, 1972-1986, 194 episodes of bacteremia occurred in 132 patients with acute leukemia at the third department of medicine, kanazawa university hospital, giving an incidence of 478 episodes per 1,000 hospital admissions. this incidence was at least twice as high as that in patients with chronic leukemia, malignant lymphoma, multiple myeloma or aplastic anemia, and about 40-fold higher than that in patients with all other internal diseases. the  rate of occurrence of bacteremia, whether unimicrobial or polymicrobial, remained almost unchanged throughout the study period. the frequency of gram-negative bacilli decreased significantly, however, from 81% of the total isolates for the  first 10-yr period to 50% for the second 5-yr period. escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated in markedly decreasing frequency, but pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae in relatively constant frequency. the majority of p. aeruginosa isolates belonged to a limited number of o-antigen  groups, suggesting the possibility of nosocomial infection. on the other hand, the frequency of gram-positive cocci increased from 9 to 36%. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus species, and staphylococcus aureus emerged as important pathogens. such a change in the spectrum of organisms was considered to coincide  with the common use of the so-called second- and third-generation cephalosporins  and central venous catheters. it is thus suggested that vancomycin be added to empiric antibiotic therapy, especially when gram-positive infections are clinically or microbiologically suspected, and that reducing the acquisition of p. aeruginosa from the hospital environment remains a priority in infection prevention.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

TI  == sterility testing of home and inpatient parenteral nutrition solutions.
AB  == the microbial contamination rate was compared for parenteral nutrition solutions  prepared by patients for home use and by pharmacy personnel for inpatient use. phase i validated the ivex 0.22-micron inline filter as a tool for microbiological testing by inoculating small numbers of organisms in 5% dextrose  injection and testing for recovery. phase ii validated the same method for determining microbial contamination of total parenteral nutrition (tpn) solutions. phase iii compared inpatient and home tpn microbial contamination rates using the methodology validated in phase ii. test organism inocula used in  phase i and ii were candida albicans, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. all contaminated  solutions in phase i showed visual turbidity within 48 hr, and all test organisms were recovered and identified. all phase ii-contaminated tpn solutions showed visual turbidity after 96 hr, and all test organisms were recovered and identified. one hundred postinfusion tpn samples were collected randomly during phase iii from inpatient parenteral nutrition patients. six patients and two hospitals participated in the study. none of the 44 home parenteral nutrition samples and none of the 56 inpatient tpn samples developed visible turbidity. subcultures of each sample on blood agar were negative for microbial growth. this described methodology offers an effective means to establish contamination rates  of parenteral nutrition solutions after administration.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cgp 31608, a new penem antibiotic.
AB  == the in vitro activity of a new penem antimicrobial agent, cgp 31608, was compared with those of imipenem, sch 34343, and several other antimicrobial agents against approximately 600 bacterial isolates. cgp 31608 was active against gram-positive  organisms, including methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic for 90% of the isolates [mic90], 0.25 microgram/ml) and penicillin-susceptible streptococci (mic90s, less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml). penicillin-resistant streptococci (including enterococci) and methicillin-resistant s. aureus were more resistant to the penem. activities of cgp 31608 against members of the family enterobacteriaceae were remarkably uniform, with mic90s of 8 to 16 micrograms/ml. cgp 31608 was at least as active as imipenem and ceftazidime and more active than piperacillin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. drug activity was not influenced by the presence of any of 10 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases. against strains of serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, and p. aeruginosa with derepressible chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, the presence of cefoxitin did not induce increased resistance to cgp 31608. the new drug was also active against anaerobes (mic90s, 0.25 to 8 micrograms/ml), haemophilus influenzae (mic90s, 0.5 to 1.0 micrograms/ml), and legionella spp. (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml). cgp 31608 showed an antibacterial spectrum similar to those of imipenem and sch 34343 (except that the latter is not active against p. aeruginosa) but was generally less potent than these drugs. however, cgp 31608 demonstrated more activity (mic90) than imipenem against p. aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis and s. aureus.

TI  == non-ige-dependent bacteria-induced histamine release from human lung and tonsillar mast cells.
AB  == a wide spectrum of formalin-killed bacteria have been tested for their ability to release histamine from human dispersed lung and tonsillar mast cells. escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella oxytoca and k. pneumoniae were the most effective histamine releasers. further studies on tonsillar mast cells showed that e. coli-induced histamine release differed from ige-dependent release with respect to its kinetics, temperature and ph profiles and its sensitivity to calcium deprivation and metabolic inhibitors. a lectin-mediated mechanism may operate, but other non-immunological mechanisms might also be involved in the release. escherichia coli and anti-ige did not synergize in inducing histamine release. the production of pgd2 and the failure to detect lactate dehydrogenase following incubation of mast cells with e. coli suggests that histamine release is not due to cytotoxicity.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new penem, cgp 31608.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cgp 31608, a new penem, against aerobic and anaerobic organisms was evaluated and compared with those of other beta-lactams. cgp 31608  inhibited escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, and salmonella, shigella, aeromonas, and yersinia spp. with mics for 50% of the strains (mic50s) of 2 to 4 micrograms/ml and mic90s of 4 micrograms/ml, compared with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and imipenem mics of less than 0.25 microgram/ml. mic90s were 8 micrograms/ml for enterobacter species and c. freundii, for which other agents had mics of 32 micrograms/ml, except imipenem, which had equal activity. the mic90 for proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia stuartii, and providencia rettgeri was 8 micrograms/ml, compared with less than 2 micrograms/ml shown by the other agents. acinetobacter species resistant to other agents except imipenem were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml, as were pseudomonas aeruginosa, including piperacillin-, ceftazidime-, and gentamicin-resistant isolates. the mic for p. cepacia, p. fluorescens, and p. acidovorans was less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, but that for p. maltophilia was greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. hemolytic streptococci a, b, c, g, and f were inhibited by less than 1 micrograms/ml, but the mic for streptococcus faecalis was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. mics for staphylococcus aureus methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, as were those for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant s. epidermidis. bacteroides fragilis and clostridium species and fusobacterium spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. cgp 31608 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, pse-1, oxa-2, pse-4, or by s. aureus. chromosomal beta-lactamases of type ia in enterobacter cloacae p99 and morganella morganii, ic in p. vulgaris, k-1 in k. oxytoca, and id in p. aeruginosa also did not hydrolyze cgp 31608. it inhibited tem-1, but the 50% inhibitory concentration was 14.2 micrograms/ml compared with 0.15 micrograms/ml for the p99 enzyme. cgp 31608 induced beta-lactamases in p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae, c. freundii and providencia rettgeri, but there was no increase in mics for the isolates and it did not select strains derepressed for beta-lactamase production. synergy of cgp 31608 and gentamicin was found against 90% p. aeruginosa, 60% enterobacter cloacae, and 50% serratia marcescens strains. no synergy was found with rifampin. a postantibiotic effect was found against e. coli.

AB  == nalidixic and five newer 4-quinolones, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin were tested against 576 recent clinical aerobic bacterial isolates. the 4-quinolones were regularly active (mic90 less than 4 mg/l) against the following bacteria: staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. saprophyticus, different enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, agrobacter spp., aeromonas spp., plesiomonas spp., neisseria meningitidis. other bacteria were usually intermediately susceptible or resistant: different streptococci, listeria monocytogenes, nocardia asteroides, p. maltophilia, achromobacter xylosoxydans and alcaligenes denitrificans. ciprofloxacin was the most potent compound, followed by ofloxacin and pefloxacin, norfloxacin and enoxacin being less active. all the 4-quinolones were much more active than nalidixic acid. the mbc/mic ratios of the 4-quinolones were between 1 and 2 with a majority of strains, and between 2 and 3 with streptococcus agalactiae, str. faecalis and l. monocytogenes. a two- to eight-fold increase of mic was observed by increasing the inoculum 10,000-fold with most of the strains tested. susceptible bacterial population of klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa contained more clones resistant to nalidixic acid (10(4) to 10(8) at four times the mic) than to 4-quinolones (10(5) to 10(9) at four times the mic). supplementing the media with mgso4 produced smaller inhibition zone diameters with a disc diffusion method than those obtained with non-supplemented  agar, with all quinolone or strains. less regular effect, or no effect was obtained after supplementation with znso4 or ca(no3)2.

TI  == assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  == blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (cfu) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. at intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (hs-glc). forty-six isolates including all those examined of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, s. faecalis, s. milleri, s. mitior, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia sp., enterobacter cloacae, bacterioides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, c. krusei and torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by hs-glc. hs-glc failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus. haemophilus influenzae, corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of s. epidermidis. the growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. no significant difference was found between hs-glc analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. all the yeast isolates were detected by hs-glc after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by hs-glc analysis than by other methods.

TI  == in vitro combination effects of cefotetan with four aminoglycosides, piperacillin and mezlocillin on gram-positive and gram-negative nosocomial bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro efficacy of cefotetan in combination with gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, netilmicin against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterobacter cloacae and with piperacillin and mezlocillin against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens and enterobacter cloacae was compared by use of the checkerboard agar dilution technique. on average, 60% of the gram-negative and 46% of the gram-positive strains were inhibited by additive, but only 22% of the gram-negative and 2% of the gram-positive bacteria were inhibited by synergistic cefotetan-aminoglycoside combinations. netilmicin combinations were least active. on gram-negative bacteria, 63% of the cefotetan-penicillin combinations were additive and 11% synergistic. no antagonism occurred with any of the combinations.

TI  == superinfections in herpes simplex keratitis.
AB  == we reviewed 15 cases of culture-proven corneal superinfections in 15 patients (eight men and seven women ranging in age from 41 to 86 years) with recurrent herpes simplex keratitis. the factors that appeared to increase the risk of superinfection were the presence of an epithelial defect (found in all 15 cases), a history of recurrent herpetic keratouveitis (found in ten cases), and the use of topical corticosteroids (found in 13 cases). eight of the 15 patients were taking antibiotics at the time the superinfections were diagnosed, indicating that topical antibiotics do not provide sufficient protection. gram-negative rods were found in six cases (proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and achromobacter sp.). gram-positive organisms, often in association with another infecting agent, were  found in six cases (staphylococcus epidermidis, three cases; s. aureus, two cases; and streptococcus sp., two cases). fungal superinfections were found in three cases (cephalosporium acremonium, candida albicans, and aspergillus fumigatus, one case each). mycobacterium cheloni was found in two cases.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of e-0702, a new cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro activity of e-0702 was compared with the in vitro activity of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam against 600 gram-positive and  gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates. e-0702 had a minimal inhibitory concentration for 50% of isolates (mic50) of 25 micrograms for staphylococcus aureus, 50 micrograms for staphylococcus epidermidis, and 1.6 to 3.1 micrograms for streptococci, with streptococcus faecalis resistant. e-0702 had mic50s against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter aerogenes comparable to those of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam, but mic90s were higher than those of the other agents. it was as active as the other  agents against proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp., and shigella spp., but was four- to eightfold less active against citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, providencia spp., morganella spp., and proteus vulgaris, with isolates in each species resistant. activity against bacteroides fragilis was fourfold less than that of cefoxitin. e-0702 was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases and was only a weak inhibitor of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. there was an inoculum effect for e. cloacae, serratia spp., morganella spp., and pseudomonas spp.

TI  == open study of ceftazidime in serious infections due to multiply-resistant bacteria.
AB  == we treated 37 infections in 32 patients who had one or more significant underlying diseases. most of the responsible micro-organisms were multiresistant, but were initially sensitive to ceftazidime. they included 16 pseudomonas spp., 10 serratia spp., 6 klebsiella spp., 7 other enterobacteriaceae, 3 staphylococcus spp., 3 strict anaerobes and 1 acinetobacter anitratus. indications for ceftazidime encompassed a broad spectrum of diseases: 10 complicated uti, 13 skeletal and soft tissue infections, 4 bronchopulmonary infections, 6 intra-abdominal infections, 3 septicaemias, 1 brain abscess with meningitis. ceftazidime was administered without other antimicrobials, except for metronidazole in two patients with intra-abdominal abscesses. doses varied from 2 to 12 g/day (median: 3 g), given for 3-31 days (median: 12 days). clinical cure was recorded in 26 patients (81%), 24 (75%) having also a bacteriological cure. in six patients, clinical findings subsided significantly but with incomplete resolution or relapse during follow-up. four organisms developed resistance during therapy: 2 pseudomonas, 1 enterobacter cloacae and 1 bacteroides vulgatus. three patients developed mild superinfections (2 candida, 1 staph. epidermidis).  ceftazidime was well tolerated; adverse events were mild and reversible. local thrombophlebitis was observed twice, two patients had a positive reaction to the  direct coombs' test, two had transitory elevation of transaminases and one suffered from drowsiness during intravenous injections. ceftazidime appeared to be a valuable weapon for fighting severe infections in compromised patients, especially when gram-negative bacilli were involved.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefodizime, an aminothiazolyl iminomethoxy cephalosporin.
AB  == cefodizime, an iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin similar to moxalactam and ceftazidime, was less active (minimal inhibitory concentration, 1.6 to 12 micrograms) than cefazolin or cefotaxime against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. it inhibited haemophilus and neisseria spp. at less than 0.5 microgram/ml. it did not inhibit methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococci, or listeria spp. and was 8- to 32-fold less active than cefotaxime,  moxalactam, or ceftazidime against escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella pneumoniae, providencia spp., and serratia spp. cefotaxime-resistant enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and proteus vulgaris were resistant to cefodizime. cefodizime was less active than cefoxitin or moxalactam against bacteroides fragilis. cefodizime was not hydrolyzed by common plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases, and it inhibited type i beta-lactamases.

TI  == hydrogen peroxide-mediated antagonism against serratia marcescens by streptococcus mitis.
AB  == the alpha-hemolytic streptococcus mitis strain no. 17-1, isolated from the oral cavity of an healthy female adult, antagonized the growth of all 24 test strains  of serratia marcescens examined; furthermore, this strain inhibited the growth of various strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, listeria monocytogenes, and corynebacterium diphtheriae. however, strans of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa proved refractory. the mechanism of microbial antagonism was due to production and release of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic atmospheric conditions, which was neutralized through incorporation of bovine liver catalase into the solid assay medium.

TI  == in vitro activity of moxalactam against pathogenic bacteria and its comparison with other antibiotics.
AB  == 843 isolates from clinical specimens were tested against moxalactam by disc agar  diffusion. the bacteria used in this study consisted of escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, providencia rettgeri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and group b and group d streptococci. in vitro activity of moxalactam was compared with the following antibiotics: ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, colistin, erythromycin, gentamicin, oxacillin, penicillin, tetracycline, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. of the 471 strains of enterobacteriaceae tested, 466 (98.9%) were susceptible to moxalactam. except for penicillin g, the gram-positive cocci were generally more resistant to moxalactam than the other beta-lactam antibiotics. moxalactam was comparable to gentamicin,  as far as its activity against p. aeruginosa was concerned, but was less effective than amikacin, tobramycin, carbenicillin or colistin.

TI  == broviac catheter-related bacteremia in oncology patients.
AB  == in 27 pediatric oncology patients (median age, 2 years) undergoing chemotherapy for malignant tumours, silastic broviac catheters were placed to provide vascular access. the catheters were in place for a total of 174 patient-months. there were 14 episodes of broviac catheter-related bacteremia or fungemia that occurred in six patients: one patient had six bacteremic episodes, one patient had four episodes, and four patients each had one bacteremic episode. cultures of blood drawn from broviac catheter were positive in all instances, and in 12 of 14 samples drawn from the peripheral vein. the most common initial symptoms were fever and chills. the species causing the infections were enterobacter cloacae (three cases), staphylococcus epidermidis (three cases), staphylococcus aureus (three cases), klebsiella pneumoniae (two cases), escherichia coli (two cases), pseudomonas dentrificans, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida tropicalis. antimicrobials administered through the catheter cured the infection in ten of the 11 cases in which they were used.

TI  == efficacy of ceftriaxone in serious bacterial infections.
AB  == ceftriaxone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with broad-spectrum in vitro activity and an unusually long serum half-life. the clinical efficacy of ceftriaxone was evaluated in 35 infections in 34 patients; 12 of these patients had skin and soft tissue infections, 10 had infections of the urinary tract, 8 had pneumonia, 2 had biliary tract infections, 1 had sinusitis, 1 had diverticulitis, and 1 had a retroperitoneal abscess. of the 35 infections, 9 were bacteremic. the bacteria isolated included staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus  epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, other streptococcal species, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, other bacteroides species, and anaerobic cocci. improvement or cure occurred in 32 episodes, for a response rate of 91%. there were three treatment failures in patients with soft tissue infections. no serious drug toxicities were observed. at a dosage regimen of 1 g  every 12 h the peak and trough serum antibiotic concentrations were well above the minimal inhibitory concentrations of most pathogens. our findings suggest that ceftriaxone is a safe and effective antibiotic for therapy of serious bacterial infections.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of heparin.
AB  == single clinical isolates of eight species of microorganisms were incubated in solutions of heparin and brain heart infusion broth at various concentrations to  determine the possible antibacterial effect of heparin. at heparin concentrations ranging from 12.5 to 400 u/ml, the effect on escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis varied with brain heart infusion broth concentrations of 1.2 to 10% and inocula of 10(2) to 10(6) colony-forming units per ml; similar effects were not observed with klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and citrobacter spp. the minimal inhibitory concentrations of heparin for ten strains of each species were determined in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth with inocula of 10(4) colony-forming units per ml. all 10 isolates of s. aureus and all 10 of s. epidermidis were inhibited by heparin concentrations of 125 to 500 u/ml. three e. coli, four p. aeruginosa, and nine c. albicans strains were inhibited by </=500 u of heparin per ml. none of the k. pneumoniae, e. aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, and citrobacter spp. was inhibited by heparin at </=500 u/ml. heparin inhibition  of s. aureus in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth-500 u of heparin per ml could be  quantitatively overcome by addition of magnesium, calcium, or magnesium and calcium. these data suggest that the growth of microorganisms from heparin-containing material may be suppressed.

TI  == the fate of bacteria in frozen red cells.
AB  == units of blood were intentionally contaiminated with suspensions of either aerobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, enterobacter cloacae,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, sarcina lutea, seratia marcesens, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, paracolabacterum aerogenoides (enterobacter  hafriae), mima polymorpha or acinetobacter- calcoaceticus. when inoculation was made prior to glycerolization, the subsequent glycerolization, freezing, thawing, and deglycerolization resulted in roughly a two log reduction in the number of bacteria. when inoculation was made with a final concentration of between 10(1) and 10(5) organisms per milliliter, immediately following deglycerolization or following washing without glycerolization and freezing, no increase in the number of bacteria was seen after 72 hours storage at 4 c. three of the 12 organisms studied decreased in number during 72 hours of storage. these data suggest that the current 24-hour limit on the post-thaw storage of frozen red blood cells may  be unnecessarily restrictive.

AB  == we have tried in this study to reproduce in germfree mice a bacterial equilibrium observed previously in the gastrointestinal tract of child "l.n.", reared in a plastic isolator. eight bacterial strains were studied. seven had been fortuitously introduced: acinetobacter lwoffi ln1, staphylococcus epidermidis ln2, clostridium perfringens ln3, plectridium anatum ln4, streptococcus bovis ln5, enterobacter cloacae ln6, corynebacterium sp ln7. the eighth strain was purposely administered to the child in order to take advantage of an antagonism between this strain and spontaneously acquired flora. this strain is bacillus licheniformis fd1. the gnotoxenic mice proved to be a good experimental model because we found their bacterial equilibrium comparable to that observed in child l.n. in addition, we studied the decontamination procedures of the gastrointestinal tract of mice by observing both the antagonism of b. licheniformis with bacitracin, and the action of a suitable mixture of antibiotics. conditions for the realization of this decontamination are discussed in this study.
