TI  == microbial equol production attenuates colonic methanogenesis and sulphidogenesis  in vitro.
AB  == hydrogen gas produced during colonic fermentation is excreted in breath and flatus, or removed by hydrogen-consuming bacteria such as methanogens and sulphate-reducing bacteria. however, recent research has shown that h2 is also consumed by equol-producing bacteria during the reduction of daidzein into equol. in this study, the interactions between methanogens, sulphate-reducing, and equol-producing bacteria were investigated under in vitro simulated intestinal conditions. in the presence of daidzein, the equol-producing bacterial consortium epc4 gave rise to equol production in cultures of methanobrevibacter smithii or desulfovibrio sp. as well as in faecal samples with methanogenic or sulphate-reducing abilities. moreover, this supplementation significantly (p<0.001) decreased the methanogenesis and sulphidogenesis. the attenuation did not occur in the absence of a daidzein source. additionally, there was no influence of soy germ powder, daidzein or equol as such, excluding a possible inhibition by these compounds. finally, a stronger decrease was observed with increasing amounts of epc4 and a constant equol production, suggesting that the observed effect was only partly caused by the action of daidzein as a hydrogen sink. these findings are of relevance since abdominal discomfort such as bloating and flatulence, are related to colonic gas production, whereas equol has potential health benefits.
