TI  == microbiological characteristics of sepsis in a university hospital.
AB  == background: microbiological characteristics of sepsis and antimicrobial resistance are well studied, although in state university of campinas, no data has been published yet. methods: the main agents related to sepsis and antimicrobial resistance were analyzed. the blood culture records requested from  4,793 hospitalized patients were analyzed. the samples were processed using the bact/alert system for agent identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. results: a total of 1,017 patients met the inclusion criteria for a sepsis diagnosis, with 2,309 samples tested (2.27 samples/patient). there were 489 positive samples (21% positive) isolated from 337 patients (33.13%), but more rigorous criteria excluding potential contaminants resulted in analysis being restricted to 266 patients (315 agents). the prevalent microorganisms were coagulase negative staphylococcus (cns) (15.87%), escherichia coli (13.0%), staphylococcus aureus (11.7%), klebsiella pneumoniae (9.8%), enterobacter sp (9.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (9.2%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.7%) and candida sp (5.1%). examining antimicrobial resistance in the agents revealed that 51% of  the s. aureus isolates were methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and 80% of the cns isolates were oxacillin-resistant. for a. baumannii, the ideal profile drugs  were ampicillin sulbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam, and for p. aeruginosa, they were piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime. enterobacteria showed on average 32.5% and 35.7% resistance to beta-lactams and ciprofloxacin, respectively. when all gram-negative bacteria were considered, the resistance to  beta-lactams rose to 40.5%, and the resistance to ciprofloxacin rose to 42.3%. conclusions: eighty percent of the agents identified in blood cultures from patients with sepsis belonged to a group of eight different agents. for empirical treatment, carbapenems and vancomycin unfortunately still remain the best therapeutic choice, except for a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa, for which piperacillin/tazobactan is the best option.

TI  == crystal structure of peptidyl-trna hydrolase from a gram-positive bacterium, streptococcus pyogenes at 2.19 a resolution shows the closed structure of the substrate-binding cleft.
AB  == peptidyl-trna hydrolase (pth) catalyses the release of trna and peptide components from peptidyl-trna molecules. pth from a gram-positive bacterium streptococcus pyogenes (sppth) was cloned, expressed, purified and crystallised.  three-dimensional structure of sppth was determined by x-ray crystallography at 2.19 a resolution. structure determination showed that the asymmetric unit of the unit cell contained two crystallographically independent molecules, designated a  and b. the superimposition of c(alpha) traces of molecules a and b showed an r.m.s. shift of 0.4 a, indicating that the structures of two crystallographically independent molecules were identical. the polypeptide chain of sppth adopted an overall alpha/beta conformation. the substrate-binding cleft in sppth is formed with three loops: the gate loop, ile91-leu102; the base loop, gly108-gly115; and  the lid loop, gly136-gly150. unlike in the structures of pth from gram-negative bacteria, the entry to the cleft in the structure of sppth appeared to be virtually closed. however, the conformations of the active site residues were found to be similar.

TI  == amie, a novel n-acylhomoserine lactone acylase belonging to the amidase family, from the activated-sludge isolate acinetobacter sp. strain ooi24.
AB  == many gram-negative bacteria use n-acyl-l-homoserine lactones (ahls) as quorum-sensing signal molecules. we have reported that acinetobacter strains isolated from activated sludge have ahl-degrading activity. in this study, we cloned the amie gene as an ahl-degradative gene from the genomic library of acinetobacter sp. strain ooi24. high-performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed that amie functions as an ahl acylase, which hydrolyzes the amide bond of ahl. amie showed a high level of degrading activity against ahls with long acyl chains but no activity against ahls with acyl chains shorter than eight carbons. amie showed homology with a member of the amidases (ec 3.5.1.4) but not  with any known ahl acylase enzymes. an amino acid sequence of amie from ooi24 showed greater than 99% identities with uncharacterized proteins from acinetobacter ursingii cip 107286 and acinetobacter sp. strain cip 102129, but it was not found in the draft or complete genome sequences of other acinetobacter strains. the presence of transposase-like genes around the amie genes of these three acinetobacter strains suggests that amie is transferred by a putative transposon. furthermore, the expression of amie in pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 reduced ahl accumulation and elastase activity, which were regulated by ahl-mediated quorum sensing.

TI  == rapid detection of blandm, blakpc, blaimp, and blavim carbapenemase genes in bacteria by loop-mediated isothermal amplification.
AB  == a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) assay was developed and evaluated for rapid detection of blakpc, blandm, blaimp, and blavim carbapenemase genes. six oligonucleotides, including outer, inner, and loop primers, were designed for eight distinct regions in each target gene. two qualitative criteria were used to evaluate lamp reactions: visual inspection of color change and real-time detection of fluorescence change. the lower detection limit was 10 colony forming units (cfu) per reaction for real-time detection and 100 cfu per reaction for visual inspection for each gene. two hundred twenty-two carbapenem-resistant clinical isolates (including 100 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 100 acinetobacter sp., and 22 enterobacteriaceae) were tested by lamp assay. at the same time, these isolates were confirmed by conventional polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and sequencing analysis. in these clinical isolates, the results of 11 strains with blandm, 11 strains with blakpc, 11 strains with blavim, and 2 strains with blaimp obtained using lamp assays were concordant with conventional pcr. the lamp method reported here may be a useful and powerful tool for rapid detection of blandm, blakpc, blaimp, and blavim carbapenemase genes in bacteria.

TI  == [news of antibiotic resistance among gram-negative bacilli in algeria].
AB  == antibiotic resistance has become a major public health problem in algeria. indeed the past decade, we have seen a significant increase in resistance to antibiotics especially in gram-negative bacilli. resistance to beta-lactams in enterobacteria is dominated by the production of esbl ctx-m-3 and ctx-m-15. the strains producing these enzymes are often the cause of potentially serious infections in  both hospital and community settings. identified plasmid cephalosporinases are cmy-2, cmy-12 and dha-1. the isolation of strains of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa producing carbapenemases is rare in algeria. some enterobacteriaceae producing oxa-48 or vim-19 have been reported; so far, only vim-2 has been identified in p. aeruginosa. however, the situation regarding the  strains of acinetobacter baumannii resistant to carbapenemases seems to be more disturbing. the carbapenemase oxa-23 is the most common and seems to be endemic in the north. the carbapenemase ndm-1 has also been identified. resistance to aminoglycosides is marked by the identification arma gene associated with blactx-m genes in strains of salmonella sp. several other resistance genes have been identified sporadically in strains of enterobacteriaceae, p. aeruginosa and  a. baumannii. resistance genes to fluoroquinolones are more recent identification in algeria. the most common are the qnr determinants followed by the bifunctional enzyme aac[6']-ib-cr. resistance to sulfonamides and trimethoprim was also reported in enterobacteriaceae strains in the west of the country.

TI  == acanthamoeba and bacteria produce antimicrobials to target their counterpart.
AB  == background: in the microbial ecosystem, microbes compete for space and nutrients. consequently, some have developed the ability to kill or inhibit the growth of other competing microbes by producing antimicrobial substances. as the 'producer' species are generally immune to these substances, their compounds act on the competing microbial species and give the producer more space and access to nutrients for growth. many currently used antibiotics were developed by exploiting this potential of certain microbes. findings: here, the free-living amoeba, acanthamoeba castellanii, was investigated for its antibacterial activity against representative gram positive and gram negative bacteria, while bacterial  isolates were tested for their anti-amoebic properties. conditioned medium from a. castellanii showed remarkable bactericidal properties against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) exhibiting almost 100% kill rate, but had limited effect against acinetobacter sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre). similarly, the conditioned  medium of e. coli k1 and enterobacter sp., exhibited potent anti-acanthamoebic effects in a concentration-dependent manner. conditioned media of acanthamoeba, e. coli k1 and enterobacter sp. showed no cytotoxicity in vitro when tested against human brain microvascular endothelial cells. active molecule/s in aforementioned amoebic and two bacterial conditioned media were 5 - 10 kda, and <5 kda respectively. conclusions: a. castellanii conditioned medium showed potent bactericidal properties against mrsa. the active molecule(s) are heat- and pronase-resistant, and in the 5 to 10 kda molecular mass range. contrary to this, e. coli k1 and enterobacter sp., conditioned medium showed anti-amoebic effects that are <5 kda in molecular mass, suggestive of active metabolites.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime-avibactam against gram-negative organisms collected from u.s. medical centers in 2012.
AB  == the activities of the novel beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combination ceftazidime-avibactam and comparator agents were evaluated against a contemporary collection of clinically significant gram-negative bacilli. avibactam is a novel  non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor that inhibits ambler class a, c, and some d enzymes. a total of 10,928 gram-negative bacilli-8,640 enterobacteriaceae, 1,967 pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 321 acinetobacter sp. isolates-were collected from 73 u.s. hospitals and tested for susceptibility by reference broth microdilution methods in a central monitoring laboratory (jmi laboratories, north liberty, ia, usa). ceftazidime was combined with avibactam at a fixed concentration of 4 mug/ml. overall, 99.8% of enterobacteriaceae strains were inhibited at a ceftazidime-avibactam mic of </=4 mug/ml. ceftazidime-avibactam was active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-phenotype escherichia  coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, meropenem-nonsusceptible (mic>/=2 mug/ml) k. pneumoniae, and ceftazidime-nonsusceptible enterobacter cloacae. among esbl-phenotype k. pneumoniae strains, 61.1% were meropenem susceptible and 99.3%  were inhibited at a ceftazidime-avibactam mic of </=4 mug/ml. among p. aeruginosa strains, 96.9% were inhibited at a ceftazidime-avibactam mic of </=8 mug/ml, and  susceptibility rates for meropenem, ceftazidime, and piperacillin-tazobactam were 82.0, 83.2, and 78.3%, respectively. ceftazidime-avibactam was the most active compound tested against meropenem-nonsusceptible p. aeruginosa (mic50/mic90, 4/16 mug/ml; 87.3% inhibited at </=8 mug/ml). acinetobacter spp. (ceftazidime-avibactam mic50/mic90, 16/>32 mug/ml) showed high rates of resistance to most tested agents. in summary, ceftazidime-avibactam demonstrated  potent activity against a large collection of contemporary gram-negative bacilli  isolated from patients in u.s. hospitals in 2012, including organisms that are resistant to most currently available agents, such as k. pneumoniae carbapenemase (kpc)-producing enterobacteriaceae and meropenem-nonsusceptible p. aeruginosa.

TI  == coral-associated bacteria, quorum sensing disrupters, and the regulation of biofouling.
AB  == marine biofouling, the settlement of microorganisms and macroorganisms on structures submerged in seawater, although economically detrimental, is a successful strategy for survival in hostile environments, where coordinated bacterial communities establish biofilms via the regulation of quorum sensing (qs) communication systems. the inhibition of qs activity among bacteria isolated from different coral species was investigated to gain further insight into its potency in the attenuation, or even the prevention, of undesirable biofouling on  marine organisms. it is hypothesized that coral mucus/microorganism interactions  are competitive, suggesting that the dominant communities secrete qs disruptive compounds. one hundred and twenty bacterial isolates were collected from healthy  coral species and screened for their ability to inhibit qs using three bioreporter strains. approximately 12, 11, and 24% of the isolates exhibited anti-qs activity against escherichia coli psb1075, chromobacterium violaceum cv026, and agrobacterium tumefaciens kyc55 indicator strains, respectively. isolates with positive activity against the bioluminescent monitor strains were scanned via a cytotoxic/genotoxic, e. coli tv1061 and dpd2794 antimicrobial panel. isolates detected by c. violaceum cv026 and a. tumefaciens kyc55 reporter  strains were tested for their ability to inhibit the growth of these reporter strains, which were found to be unaffected. tests of the favia sp. coral isolate  fav 2-50-7 (>98% similarity to vibrio harveyi) for its ability to attenuate the formation of biofilm showed extensive inhibitory activity against biofilms of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. to ascertain the stability and general structure of the active compound, cell-free culture supernatants exposed to an increasing temperature gradient or to digestion by proteinase k, were shown to maintain potent qs attenuation and the ability to inhibit the growth of biofilms. mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of a low molecular mass compound. the anti-qs strategy exemplified in the coral mucus is a model with potentially wide applications, including countering the ecological threat posed by biofilms. manipulating synchronized bacterial behavior by detecting new  qs inhibitors will facilitate the discovery of new antifouling compounds.

TI  == ml302, a novel beta-lactamase (bla) inhibitor
AB  == vim-2 and imp-1 are ambler class b metallo-beta-lactamases (mbl) capable of hydrolyzing a broad-spectrum of beta-lactam antibiotics. although the discovery and development of mbl inhibitors continue to be an area of active research, an array of potent, non-selective (broad-acting) small molecule inhibitors is yet to be fully characterized. here we describe a novel dual vim-2/imp-1 inhibitor that  exhibits efficacy in multiple clinical isolates. we therefore claim cid 53362017/sid 134220672 as a potent, broad acting vim-2/imp-1 probe (ml302). this  compound was discovered from a medicinal chemistry effort that sought to improve  the potency and efficacy of high-throughput screening (hts) hits. during these chemistry efforts, we identified a rhodanine scaffold that exhibited activity against recombinant vim-2 and imp-1 in nitrocefin-based enzyme activity assays. various secondary assays were run to determine its dual potency (vim-2 ic50 = 548 nm; imp-1 ic50 = 3.02 mum) and class b selectivity (it was inactive in tem-1 and  ampc beta-lactamase enzymatic assays). kinetic analyses demonstrated that ml302 behaves as a mixed mode uncompetitive/non-competitive inhibitor, with submicromolar ki values against vim-2 and imp-1 (ki = 183 +/- 24 nm and 930 +/- 97 nm, respectively). this represents an improvement in both our prior probe ml121 and the previously existing art compound mitoxantrone, each of which inhibited only vim-2. subsequent studies revealed that this probe potentiates the activity of imipenem antibiotic in inhibiting growth of laboratory e. coli bl21 strains harboring vim-2 and imp-1, as well as clinical isolates ymc07 (vim-2-containing acinetobacter sp.), baa-2146 (ndm-1-containing klebsiella pneumonia), pa641 (vim-2-containing pseudomonas aeruginosa), and kn20 (imp-1-containing pseudomonas aeruginosa). this probe will serve as a valuable tool to elucidate the role of vim-2 and imp-1 in nosocomial beta-lactam antibiotic resistance.

TI  == surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in indian.
AB  == objective: to record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. methods: urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (uti)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by kirby-bauer's disc  diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. results: from wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during april 2011 to september 2012. two gram-positive, staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis), and nine gram-negative bacteria, acinetobacter baumannii, citrobacter sp., escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. both s. aureus and e. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. particularly, all gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for uti. conclusions: antibiograms of 11 uti-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and s. aureus. moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of s. aureus and e. faecalis is a matter of concern.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in bacterial isolates from a delhi hospital: one year outcomes.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance and hospital acquired infections have become an important public health issue. data on pathogen and antibiotic resistance is important for physicians, microbiologists and infection control officials but limited information on antibiotic resistance prevents pathogen specific therapy and propels antibiotic misuse. a retrospective review of bacterial isolation and  antimicrobial susceptibility profiles in the in- and outpatients of a delhi hospital between january 2009-december 2009 was performed. a total of 1772 pathogens causing bacterial infections were recorded during the study period january 2009-december 2009. the most frequently encountered bacterial pathogens were escherichia coli (40.51%), klebsiella spp. (14.84%) and staphylococcus aureus (13.99%). we encountered high resistance to ciprofloxacin in enterobactereaceae family, i.e., 32.5%. aminoglycosides, once considered optimum  for broad spectrum coverage of pathogens for almost all systemic infections, are  now showing high rate of resistance as was noted in acinetobacter sp. (57.14%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (69.2%). antibiotic susceptibility results show a higher level of resistance to cotrimoxazole, cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin which are easily available, orally administered and cheaper and thus are considered a better option for the patients. this study provides insight into the problem of resistance in bacterial pathogens in delhi. our results demonstrated that, in general, isolates have high rates of resistance to antibiotics commonly  used in developing countries. guidelines for surveillance and prevention of nosocomial infections must be implemented in order to reduce the rate of hospital acquired infections.

AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare practically achieved disinfection efficacy of some locally available disinfectants on surfaces and infectious microbiological hospital waste. materials and methods: seven disinfectants were tested at concentrations recommended by manufacturers on rough and smooth surfaces that were contaminated experimentally by locally circulating  isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, standard isolate of salmonella typhi and candida  albicans. reduction in microbial counts before and after surface disinfection was expressed as log reduction. a very heavy microbial waste load was simulated by immersing culture plates with heavy microbial growth in disinfectants. daily, a sample of disinfectant was taken and subjected to in-use test. results: the highest average log reduction of test microbes on the rough surface was given by  desnet (5.05) and bacillocid special (5.02). a comparable average log reduction of test microbes on a smooth steel surface was noted (5.68, 5.67, 5.50) for lysol, bacillocid sp. and desnet, respectively. in the discard jars, bacillocid special worked satisfactorily for 4 days, desnet for 3 days and hi-giene germitol for 1 day. the remainder of the disinfectants failed in the in-use test on day 1. phenolics, although widely used in our settings, may not be as good surface disinfectants as newer formulations like desnet and bacillocid special. conclusions: newer quaternary ammonium compounds and aldehyde formulations were found to be the best disinfectants for disinfection of heavy contamination.

TI  == verification of monoplex and multiplex linear-after-the-exponential pcr gene-specific sepsis assays using clinical isolates.
AB  == aims: to verify monoplex and multiplex gene-specific linear-after-the-exponential polymerase chain reaction (late-pcr) assays for identifying 17 microbial pathogens (i.e., klebsiella sp., acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus,  enterobacter sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, coagulase negative staphylococci, enterococcus sp., candida sp.) commonly associated with septicaemia using clinical isolates. methods and results: clinical isolates of each target pathogen were collected from the university of california, davis medical center (ucdmc) microbiology laboratory. five microlitres (mul) of each culture suspension (1 x 10(8) cfu ml(-1) ) were added to 20 mul of monoplex mastermix. dna extracted from clinical isolates was tested in multiplex. monoplex assays demonstrated 100% sensitivity at this input level, except enterobacter cloacae (2.7%), ac. baumannii (57%) and ps. aeruginosa (97.8%). all clinical isolates were positive in multiplex, with the exception of two ac. baumannii, two klebsiella oxytoca and two candida parapsilosis isolates. conclusions: sixteen pathogens can be identified by monoplex late-pcr assays with sensitivities >/= 97.8%. the multiplex assay demonstrated 91.4% sensitivity when tested with dna extracted from 70 different target strains. significance and impact of the study: this study demonstrates the potential of late-pcr to serve as an adjunct to culture if the reagents are optimized for sensitivity. results warrant further testing through analytical and clinical validation of the multiplex assay.

TI  == in vivo-validated essential genes identified in acinetobacter baumannii by using  human ascites overlap poorly with essential genes detected on laboratory media.
AB  == a critical feature of a potential antimicrobial target is the characteristic of being essential for growth and survival during host infection. for bacteria, genome-wide essentiality screens are usually performed on rich laboratory media.  this study addressed whether genes detected in that manner were optimal for the identification of antimicrobial targets since the in vivo milieu is fundamentally different. mutant derivatives of a clinical isolate of acinetobacter baumannii were screened for growth on human ascites, an ex vivo medium that reflects the infection environment. a subset of 34 mutants with unique gene disruptions that demonstrated little to no growth on ascites underwent evaluation in a rat subcutaneous abscess model, establishing 18 (53%) of these genes as in vivo essential. the putative gene products all had annotated biological functions, represented unrecognized or underexploited antimicrobial targets, and could be grouped into five functional categories: metabolic, two-component signaling systems, dna/rna synthesis and regulation, protein transport, and structural. these a. baumannii in vivo essential genes overlapped poorly with the sets of essential genes from other gram-negative bacteria catalogued in the database of essential genes (deg), including those of acinetobacter baylyi, a closely related species. however, this finding was not due to the absence of orthologs. none of the 18 in vivo essential genes identified in this study, or their putative gene products, were targets of fda-approved drugs or drugs in the developmental pipeline, indicating that a significant portion of the available target space within pathogenic gram-negative bacteria is currently neglected. importance: the  human pathogen acinetobacter baumannii is of increasing clinical importance, and  a growing proportion of isolates are multiantimicrobial-resistant, pan-antimicrobial-resistant, or extremely resistant strains. this scenario is reflective of the general problem of a critical lack of antimicrobials effective  against antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative bacteria, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., and escherichia coli. this study identified a set of a. baumannii genes that are essential for growth and survival during infection and demonstrated the importance of using clinically relevant media and in vivo validation while screening for essential genes for the purpose of developing new antimicrobials. furthermore, it established that if a gene is absent from the database of essential genes, it should not be excluded as a potential antimicrobial target. lastly, a new set of high-value potential antimicrobial targets for pathogenic gram-negative bacteria has been identified.

TI  == microbiological profile of orbital abscess.
AB  == background: knowledge of the culture and sensitivity pattern is necessary, for the institution of appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy in orbital abscess. objective: the objective of this study is to describe culture and sensitivity patterns of specimens from the orbit and surrounding structures. materials and methods: retrospectively the medical records of 56 cases of orbital abscess were  reviewed. results: cultures were positive in 38/56 (68.8%) orbital specimens and  the organisms included staphylococcus aureus 18, streptococci 7, pseudomonas aeruginosa 3, 2 each of enterobactersp, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter sp. and 1 each of actinomyces israelii, diptheroids, coagulase negative staphylococcus, citrobacter freundii, methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. four had polymicrobial infection. culture of purulent  nasal discharge, swabs taken from foci of infection on the face, and blood cultures were done in 26/56, and positive cultures were obtained in 16/26 (61.5%) specimens. in 12 patients, there was a concurrence in the organism cultured from  the orbit and from cultures from other sites. gram-negative organisms were associated with increased ocular morbidity. conclusion: gram-positive cocci, especially s. aureus are the most common organisms isolated from orbital abscesses. infections by gram-negative organisms were associated with more complications. empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy should have a broad spectrum of activity effective against a wide range of staphylococcal organisms and gram-negative bacilli.

TI  == a study of the efficiency of edible oils degraded in alkaline conditions by pseudomonas aeruginosa ss-219 and acinetobacter sp. ss-192 bacteria isolated from japanese soil.
AB  == high lipid concentration contained in wastewater inhibits the activity of microorganisms in biological wastewater treatment systems such as activated sludge and methane fermentation. to reduce the inhibitory effects, microorganisms capable of efficiently degrading edible oils were screened from various environmental sources. from japanese soil, we isolated 2 bacteria strains with high degradation abilities at an alkaline ph without consumption of biological oxygen demand (bod) constituents. acinetobacter sp. strain ss-192 and pseudomonas aeruginosa strain ss-219 degraded 77.5 +/- 0.6% and 89.5 +/- 1.5%, respectively,  of 3,000 ppm of mixed oil consisting of salad oil/lard/beef tallow (1/1/1, w/w/w) at 37 degrees c and ph 9.0 in 24 h. efficient degradation by the two strains occurred at ph 8-9 and 25-40 degrees c. strain ss-219 degraded lipids even at ph  3. the degradation rate of 3,000 ppm of salad oil, lard, and beef tallow by strain ss-192 was 79.9 +/- 2.6%, 63.6 +/- 1.9%, and 70.1 +/- 1.2%, respectively,  during a 24-h cultivation. the degradation rate of 3,000 ppm of salad oil, lard,  and beef tallow by strain ss-219 was 82.3 +/- 2.1%, 71.9 +/- 2.2%, and 71.0 +/- 1.1%, respectively, during a 24-h cultivation. after mixed oil degradation by both strains, the bod value of the cell culture increased from 2,100 ppm to 3,200-4,000 ppm. the fact that neither strain utilizes bod ingredients will be beneficial to pretreatment of methane fermentation systems such as upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors. in addition, the growth of usual heterotrophic microorganisms utilizing soluble bod can be suppressed under alkaline ph.

TI  == spectrum and drug resistance of pathogens from patients with burns.
AB  == microbial infection is an obstacle of burn treatment. however, little is known on what types of microbial infection dominate in the burn center and how the dynamic change of those microorganisms occurs during the past several years in china. we  conducted a retrospective study of nosocomial infection (ni) in a large burn center to analyze the spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of microbial isolates from january 2003 to december 2010. we studied 989 isolates from 677 patients who had signs and symptoms of infection 48h after admission. the number of nis per 100 admissions was 10.9. the commonest isolates were pseudomonas aeruginosa (23.1%), staphylococcus aureus (18.7%), and candida (11.4%). the result indicated that the numbers of patients with acinetobacter sp. infection increased (p=0.004), but with proteus mirabilis infection decreased (p=0.004). the isolated acinetobacter sp. and p. aeruginosa were consistently highly resistant to almost  all antibiotics tested. notably, more frequent acinetobacter sp. isolates appeared to be resistant to amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ceftazidim, piperacillin, tazobactam, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin and more frequent escherichia coli isolates were resistant to ceftazidime and aztreonam at the late time period although the p. aeruginosa and e. coli isolates were sensitive to less used ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam. the increased rates of drug-resistant isolates in the later period might be associated with regular prophylactic therapy with antibiotics.

TI  == isolation of a bacteriocin-producing lactococcus lactis and application of its bacteriocin to manage spoilage bacteria in high-value marine fish under different storage temperatures.
AB  == the bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria have considerable potential for biopreservation. the lactococcus lactis strain psy2 (genbank account no. jf703669) isolated from the surface of marine perch perca flavescens produced antibacterial activity against pathogenic and spoilage-causing gram-positive and  gram-negative bacteria viz. arthrobacter sp., acinetobacter sp., bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus and possessed broad inhibitory spectrum. the biopreservative efficacy of the bacteriocin psy2 was evaluated using fillets of reef cod, epinephelus diacanthus. the fillets (10 g) were sprayed with 2.0 ml of  1,600 au/ml bacteriocin, wrapped and kept under different storage temperatures viz., 4, 0 and -18 degrees c. the biopreservative extended the shelf-life of fillets stored at 4 degrees c to >21 days as against <14 days observed in the untreated samples. the total count of spoilage bacteria was reduced by 2.5 logarithmic units in the treated sample during the 14th day of storage as against the control. chemical analysis revealed a significant change (p < 0.05) in the ph value, free fatty acid (as % oleic acid), total volatile base nitrogen and total  methyl amine content in the treated samples. the overall acceptability in terms of sensory attributes was significantly higher in the bacteriocin-treated samples stored for 21 days at 4 degrees c while the untreated samples became unacceptable by the 14th day. the biopreservative gave no significant effect at -18 degrees c. thus, the bacteriocin derived from l. lactis psy2 gave increased protection against spoilage bacteria and offers an alternative for the preservation of high-value sea foods.

TI  == gram-negative osteomyelitis: clinical and microbiological profile.
AB  == introduction: despite the growing interest in the study of gram-negative bacilli  (gnb) infections, very little information on osteomyelitis caused by gnb is available in the medical literature. objectives and methods: to assess clinical and microbiological features of 101 cases of osteomyelitis caused by gnb alone, between january 2007 and january 2009, in a reference center for the treatment of high complexity traumas in the city of sao paulo. results: most patients were men (63%), with median age of 42 years, affected by chronic osteomyelitis (43%) or acute osteomyelitis associated to open fractures (32%), the majority on the lower limbs (71%). the patients were treated with antibiotics as inpatients for 40 days (median) and for 99 days (median) in outpatient settings. after 6 months follow-up, the clinical remission rate was around 60%, relapse 19%, amputation 7%, and death 5%. nine percent of cases were lost to follow-up. a total of 121 gnb was isolated from 101 clinical samples. the most frequently isolated pathogens were enterobacter sp. (25%), acinetobacter baumannii (21%) e pseudomonas aeruginosa (20%). susceptibility to carbapenems was about 100% for enterobacter sp., 75% for pseudomonas aeruginosa and 60% for acinetobacter baumannii. conclusion: osteomyelitis caused by gnb remains a serious therapeutic  challenge, especially when associated to nonfermenting bacteria. we emphasize the need to consider these agents in diagnosed cases of osteomyelitis, so that an ideal antimicrobial treatment can be administered since the very beginning of the therapy.

TI  == evaluation of adhesiveness of acinetobacter sp. tol 5 to abiotic surfaces.
AB  == the toluene-degrading bacterium acinetobacter sp. tol 5 shows a highly adhesive and autoagglutinating nature through cell surface nanofibers. in the present study, various aspects of the adhesiveness of tol 5 cells were evaluated, namely, the association with biofilm formation, the specificity, and the effects of additives. during growth, tol 5 and pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 cells showed high capacities to form biofilms. however, resting pao1 cells barely adhered to a polystyrene (ps) surface, while a large number of resting tol 5 cells rapidly adhered. this implies that tol 5 cells are intrinsically adhesive and that their  initial attachment ability is quite high and distinguishable from their ability to form biofilm. this high adhesiveness of tol 5 cells was considered to be nonspecific because the cells adhered to various material surfaces from hydrophobic plastic surfaces to hydrophilic glass and metal surfaces. however, tol 5 cells were found not to be adhesive to escherichia coli cells. although tol 5 cells were capable of interspecies interaction and coagglutination with e. coli cells, at the surface of cell clumps, e. coli cells localized, suggesting that they disturbed autoagglutination of tol 5 cells. tol 5 has a hydrophobic cell surface. however, the addition of nonionic surfactant triton x-100 and bovine serum albumin increased the adhesion of tol 5 cells to a ps surface, in contrast  to previous reports of hydrophobic bacteria. the results highlighted the interesting features of adhesiveness of tol 5 cells.

(11 mm) while the benzene extracts of h. colorata demonstrated maximum zone of inhibition against the pathogen acinetobacter sp. (14 mm) and s. aureus (12 mm). conclusions: it is  hoped that this study would direct to the establishment of some compounds that could be used to invent new and more potent antimicrobial drugs of natural origin.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
AB  == the antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different ph values. consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of ph on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (sa) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (scmc) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (mdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa, mdr vibrio sp, mdr stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (esbl) producing salmonella sp, esbl producing klebsiella pneumoniae, esbl producing proteus mirabilis, esbl producing escherichia coli and mdr acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (czoi)]. the mean overall czoi for  the gram-positive isolates at a ph of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. a mean czoi of 5 mm was recorded for the scmc dressing, which was slightly higher,  at 5.4 mm for the sa dressing. at a ph of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed  a similar activity. however, at a ph of 8.5 the mean czoi of the scmc dressing was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the sa dressing for a select number of isolates. the mean overall czoi for the gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the gram-positive bacteria. susceptibility to  silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. interestingly, when ph was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (p < 0.05). overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all ph ranges. in addition, the study showed that the performance  of both dressings apparently increased when ph became more acidic. the findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role ph plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.

AB  == the aim of the study was to evaluate bacterial antibiotic resistance in seawater  from four beaches in algiers. the most significant resistance rates were observed for amoxicillin and ticarcillin, whereas they were relatively low for ceftazidime, cefotaxime and imipenem. according to sampling sites, the highest resistance rates were recorded for 2 sites subjected to chemical and microbiological inputs (amoxicillin, 43% and 52%; ticarcillin, 19.6% and 47.7%),  and for 2 sites relatively preserved from anthropogenic influence, resistance rates were lowest (amoxicillin, 1.5% and 16%; ticarcillin, 0.8% and 2.6%). thirty-four bacteria resistant to imipenem (n=14) or cefotaxime (n=20) were identified as pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=15), pseudomonas fluorescens (7), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4), burkholderia cepacia (2), bordetella sp. (1), pantoea sp. (1), acinetobacter baumannii (1), chryseomonas luteola (1), ochrobactrum anthropi (1) and escherichia coli (1). screening for extended spectrum beta-lactamase showed the presence of ctx-m-15 beta-lactamase in the e.  coli isolate, and the encoding gene was transferable in association with the inci1 plasmid of about 50 kbp. insertion sequence isecp1b was located upstream of the ctx-m-15 gene. this work showed a significant level of resistance to antibiotics, mainly among environmental saprophytic bacteria. transmissible ctx-m-15 was detected in e. coli; this may mean that contamination of the environment by resistant bacteria may cause the spread of resistance genes.

AB  == introduction: the main mechanism of emerging resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter sp. isolates is the production of metallo-beta-lactamases (mbetals). mbetals are enzymes capable of hydrolyzing cephalosporins, penicillins and carbapenems, but not monobactams (aztreonam), which are often used as antimicrobial therapy to treat nosocomial infections. methods: an observational descriptive and retrospective study was designed to assess the frequency of mbetals among strains of p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter sp. obtained from a tertiary hospital in southern brazil. results: mbetal production was observed in  77.6% (n = 173/223) for p. aeruginosa isolates and 22.4% (n = 50/223) of acinetobacter sp. isolates. the acinetobacter sp. isolates showed 92.8% sensitivity to amikacin and p. aeruginosa isolates showed 58.9% sensitivity to aztreonam. conclusions: the mbetal indices determined confirm the global concern  with this mechanism of resistance.

TI  == carbapenem stewardship: positive impact on hospital ecology.
AB  == introduction: excessive group 2 carbapenem use may result in decreased bacterial  susceptibility. objective: we evaluated the impact of a carbapenem stewardship program, restricting imipenem and meropenem use. methods: ertapenem was mandated  for esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae infections in the absence of non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli (gnb) from april 2006 to march 2008. group 2 carbapenems were restricted for use against gnb infections susceptible only to carbapenems and suspected gnb infections in unstable patients. cumulative susceptibility tests were done for nosocomial pathogens before and after restriction using clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guide-lines.vitek system or conventional identification methods were performed and susceptibility testing done by disk diffusion according to clsi.antibiotic consumption (t-test) and susceptibilities (mcnemar's test) were determined. results: the defined daily doses (ddd) of group 2 carbapenems declined from 61.1 to 48.7 ddd/1,000 patient-days two years after ertapenem introduction (p = 0.027). mean ertapenem consumption after restriction was 31.5 ddd/1,000 patient-days. following ertapenem introduction no significant susceptibility changes were noticed among gram-positive cocci. the most prevalent gnb were p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and acinetobacter spp. there was no change in p. aeruginosa susceptibility to carbapenems. significantly improved p. aeruginosa and k. pneumoniae ciprofloxacin susceptibilities were observed, perhaps due to decreased group 2 carbapenem use. k. pneumoniae susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole improved. conclusion: preferential use of ertapenem resulted in reduced group 2 carbapenem use, with a positive impact on p. aeruginosa and k. pneumoniae susceptibility.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of doripenem and other carbapenems against gram-negative pathogens from korea.
AB  == a total of 950 gram-negative bacterial isolates from patients with bacteremia and urinary tract infections were collected from tertiary-care hospitals in korea. in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using broth microdilution test according to clinical and laboratory standards institute protocol. in general, carbapenems such as doripenem, imipenem, and meropenem were very active against enterobacteriaceae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter sp. isolates. doripenem was more potent than imipenem against most enterobacteriaceae species except proteus spp. based on minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)(50) and mic(90). in addition, doripenem displayed similar activity to meropenem but was superior to imipenem against ceftazidime-resistant enterobacteriaceae isolates. for p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. isolates, mic(50)s of doripenem were 1 and 0.5 mg/l, respectively, which were the same with those of meropenem but two- to fourfold lower than those of imipenem (both 2 mg/l). on the basis of the in vitro data, we conclude that doripenem has equivalent or more activity than other carbapenems such as imipenem and meropenem against most gram-negative pathogens from korea. thus, doripenem may be a promising new antimicrobial agent for the treatment of infections caused by gram-negative pathogens in korea.

TI  == culture-independent techniques applied to food industry water surveillance--a case study.
AB  == culture-independent techniques were used for the detection of pathogenic bacteria in drinking water at potentially critical control points along the production lines at a german dairy company and a spanish dry cured ham company. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) was used to describe bacterial population shifts indicating biological instability in the drinking water samples. autochthonous bacteria were identified by sequencing the excised dgge dna bands.  more specifically, real-time pcr was applied to detect a number of pathogenic bacteria, i.e. listeria monocytogenes, mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, campylobacter jejuni, enterococcus spp., salmonella spp, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. due to the detection limits of the  real-time pcr method, a specific protocol was established in order to meet the technical detection requirements and to avoid unwanted polymerase inhibitions. autochthonous bacterial populations were found to be highly stable at most of the sampling points. only one sampling point exhibited population shifts at the german dairy company. enterococci and p.aeruginosa were detected in some water samples from these companies by molecular biology detection methods, but not by conventional culturing methods. some opportunistic bacteria as enterobacter sp.,  acinetobacter, sphingomonas sp. and non-pathogenic bacillus, were also detected after dna sequencing of dgge bands.

TI  == in vitro properties of bal30072, a novel siderophore sulfactam with activity against multiresistant gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == bal30072 is a new monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic belonging to the sulfactams.  its spectrum of activity against significant gram-negative pathogens with beta-lactam-resistant phenotypes was evaluated and was compared with the activities of reference drugs, including aztreonam, ceftazidime, cefepime, meropenem, imipenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam. bal30072 showed potent activity against multidrug-resistant (mdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter sp. isolates, including many carbapenem-resistant strains. the mic(90)s were 4 microg/ml for mdr acinetobacter spp. and 8 microg/ml for mdr p. aeruginosa, whereas the mic(90) of meropenem for the same sets of isolates was >32 microg/ml. bal30072 was bactericidal against both acinetobacter spp. and p. aeruginosa, even against strains that produced metallo-beta-lactamases that conferred resistance to all other beta-lactams tested, including aztreonam. it was also active against many species of mdr isolates of the enterobacteriaceae family, including isolates that had a class a carbapenemase or a metallo-beta-lactamase. unlike other monocyclic beta-lactams, bal30072 was found to trigger the spheroplasting and lysis of escherichia coli rather than the formation of extensive filaments. the basis for this unusual property is its inhibition of the bifunctional penicillin-binding proteins pbp 1a and pbp 1b, in addition to its high affinity for pbp 3, which is the target of monobactams, such as aztreonam.

TI  == ex situ bioremediation of oil-contaminated soil.
AB  == an innovative bioprocess method, systematic environmental molecular bioremediation technology (sembt) that combines bioaugmentation and biostimulation with a molecular monitoring microarray biochip, was developed as an integrated bioremediation technology to treat s- and t-series biopiles by using the landfarming operation and reseeding process to enhance the bioremediation efficiency. after 28 days of the bioremediation process, diesel oil (tph(c10-c28)) and fuel oil (tph(c10-c40)) were degraded up to approximately  70% and 63% respectively in the s-series biopiles. when the bioaugmentation and biostimulation were applied in the beginning of bioremediation, the microbial concentration increased from approximately 10(5) to 10(6) cfu/g dry soil along with the tph biodegradation. analysis of microbial diversity in the contaminated  soils by microarray biochips revealed that acinetobacter sp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the predominant groups in indigenous consortia, while the augmented consortia were gordonia alkanivorans and rhodococcus erythropolis in both series of biopiles during bioremediation. microbial respiration as influenced by the microbial activity reflected directly the active microbial population and indirectly the biodegradation of tph. field experimental results showed that the residual tph concentration in the complex biopile was reduced to  less than 500 mg tph/kg dry soil. the above results demonstrated that the sembt technology is a feasible alternative to bioremediate the oil-contaminated soil.

TI  == bacteria with dual resistance to elevated concentrations of heavy metals and antibiotics in nigerian contaminated systems.
AB  == samples of soil, water, and sediments from industrial estates in lagos were collected and analyzed for heavy metals and physicochemical composition. bacteria that are resistant to elevated concentrations of metals (cd(2+), co(2+), ni(2+),  cr(6+), and hg(2+)) were isolated from the samples, and they were further screened for antibiotic sensitivity. the minimum tolerance concentrations (mtcs)  of the isolates with dual resistance to the metals were determined. the physicochemistry of all the samples indicated were heavily polluted. twenty-two of the 270 bacterial strains isolated showed dual resistances to antibiotics and  heavy metals. the mtcs of isolates to the metals were 14 mm for cd(2+), 15 mm for co(2+) and ni(2+), 17 mm for cr(6+), and 10 mm for hg(2+). five strains (pseudomonas aeruginosa, actinomyces turicensis, acinetobacter junni, nocardia sp., and micrococcus sp.) resisted all the 18 antibiotics tested. whereas rhodococcus sp. and micrococcus sp. resisted 15 mm ni(2+), p. aeruginosa resisted 10 mm co(2+). to our knowledge, there has not been any report of bacterial strains resisting such high doses of metals coupled with wide range of antibiotics. therefore, dual expressions of antibiotics and heavy-metal resistance make the isolates, potential seeds for decommissioning of sites polluted with industrial effluents rich in heavy metals, since the bacteria will  be able to withstand in situ antibiosis that may prevail in such ecosystems.

AB  == background: our aim is to elucidate shifts in the bacterial spectrum colonising burn wounds and corresponding antibiotic susceptibilities during a 20-year study  period. methods: microbiological results from burn patients collected between 1986 and 2005 were analysed retrospectively. results: staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (20.8%), followed by escherichia coli (13.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (10.9%), enterococcus sp. (9.7%), enterobacter cloacae (5.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5%), acinetobacter sp. (3.2%), proteus mirabilis (2%) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.4%). susceptibility of s. aureus to broad-spectrum substances such as ciprofloxacin or penicillinase-stable penicillins has waned, others such as cotrimoxazole or netilmicin remained effective. not a single resistance against vancomycin was recorded. increases in methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) were pronounced (3% in 1986-1997 (the first of the three study periods) to 16% in 1998-2001 and 13% in 2002-2005). results for methicillin-resistant cns (mrcns) show an even greater increase. p. aeruginosa has shown increasing susceptibility  against netilmicin (1986-1989: 84%, 2002-2005: 95%). susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to ceftazidime has decreased markedly. s. maltophilia has shown clinically relevant susceptibility mainly against ciprofloxacin. acinetobacter sp. have shown little susceptibility to most antibiotics. imipenem or meropenem have been very reliable reserve antibiotics throughout the study period for the fermenting enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae and p. mirabilis), with susceptibilities of or near 100%. conclusion: in-depth knowledge of the bacteria causing infectious complications and of their antibiotic susceptibilities is a prerequisite for treating burn patients. our study shows shifts in the microbial spectrum and their antibiogram, which mandate frequent reassessments.

TI  == proteolytic activity in stored aerobic granular sludge and structural integrity.
AB  == aerobic granules lose stability during storage. the goal of this work was to highlight the main cause of stability loss for stored granules as intracellular protein hydrolysis. the quantity of extracellular proteins was noted to be significantly lower during granule storage, and protease enzyme activities were correspondingly higher in the cores of stored granules. the proteolytic bacteria, which secrete highly active protease enzymes, were for the first time isolated and characterized by analyzing 16s rdna sequences. the proteolytic bacteria belonged to the genera pseudomonas, raoultella, acinetobacter, pandoraea, klebsiella, bacillus and uncultured bacterium, and were grouped into proteobacteria, enterobacteria and firmicutes. the pb1 (pseudomonas aeruginosa) strain, which exhibited very high proteolytic activity during the skim milk agar  test, was located at the core regime with active protease enzymes, and was close  to the obligate anaerobic strain bacteroides sp. hence, the extracellular proteins in stored granules were proposed to be hydrolyzed by enzymes secreted by proteolytic bacteria with the hydrolyzed products ultimately being used by nearby anaerobic strains. this process gradually digests the protein core, and eventually consumes the entire granule.

AB  == the emergence of metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl)-producing isolates is a challenge to routine microbiology laboratories, since there are no standardized methods for detecting such isolates. the aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of different phenotypic methods to detect mbl production among pseudomonas spp., acinetobacter spp., and enterobacterial isolates, including gim, imp, sim, spm, and vim variants. a total of 46 genetically unrelated pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter sp., and enterobacterial strains producing distinct mbls were tested. nineteen strains were included as negative controls. the inhibition of bacterial growth and beta-lactam hydrolysis caused by mbl inhibitors (imbl) also were evaluated. the isolates were tested for mbl production by both a double-disk synergy test (ddst) and a combined disk assay (cd) using imipenem and ceftazidime as substrates in combination with distinct imbl. one hundred percent sensitivity and specificity were achieved by ddst using 2-mercaptopropionic acid in combination with ceftazidime and imipenem for the detection of mbl production among p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter species isolates, respectively. the cd test showed the same results for detecting mbl-producing enterobacteria by combining imipenem and edta, with a 5.0-mm-breakpoint increase in the size of the inhibition zone. our results indicate that both phenotypic methods to detect mbl-producing isolates should be  based on the genera to be tested, regardless of the enzyme produced by such isolates, as well as on the local prevalence of mbl producers.

TI  == the current state of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli in north america.
AB  == although much of today's media focuses on multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, resistance within gram-negative bacilli continues to rise, occasionally creating situations in which few or no antibiotics that retain activity are available. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase  (esbl)-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella sp are emerging threats nationally. although carbapenems are considered the antibiotic class of choice to treat esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae, the ability of these organisms to produce carbapenemases has now become apparent in some regions throughout the united states. although still rare, klebsiella sp that produce kpc-2 retain susceptibility only to tigecycline, polymyxins, and occasionally aminoglycosides. multidrug resistance among pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter sp has always been apparent across many hospitals in the united states. recent surveillance indicates increasing resistance to all currently available antibiotics, including carbapenems, cephalosporins, penicillins, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides.  against many strains, only polymyxins retain activity; however, resistance has also been reported to these agents. fortunately, resistance mechanisms such as metallo-beta-lactamases are still rare in the united states. as no new antibiotics with novel mechanisms against many of these gram-negative bacilli are expected to be developed in the foreseeable future, careful and conservative use  of agents combined with good infection control practices is required.

TI  == five-year review of infections in a burn intensive care unit: high incidence of acinetobacter baumannii in a tropical climate.
AB  == a 5-year review of nosocomial infections, bacteraemia and wound colonization in patients admitted to a burn intensive care unit from june 2001 to may 2006 was carried out. all patients required intubation at some point, and icu support. data on bacterial and fungal isolates were entered prospectively into a hospital-wide computerized database. nosocomial infections (nis) were defined using standard cdc criteria. seventy-six patients were admitted during the study  period, with 57 qualifying for analysis. forty-two patients (74%) developed 137 nis, with 240 nis/100 admissions. the most common ni was pneumonia (43%), followed by burn wound infection (34%), primary bloodstream infection (20%) and urinary tract infection (3%). the device specific rate of pneumonia was 143 infections per 1000 ventilator days. there were 113 episodes of bacteraemia and 173 episodes of wound colonization without infection. the most common organisms causing nosocomial infections were acinetobacter sp. (n=33), followed by methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (n=24) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=22). a. baumannii isolates were highly multiresistant, with 82 distinct strains isolated from 47 patients (82% of patients). data from this and  other studies supports the hypothesis that a. baumannii is more common in tropical, warm climes necessitating vigorous infection control measures to optimise patient outcome.

TI  == nosocomial pneumonia in a pediatric intensive care unit.
AB  == background: nosocomial pneumonia (np) is the second most common hospital acquired infection. understanding the pattern of occurrence, risk factors and etiological  agents of np in a picu, is essential for developing effective infection control measures. this prospective observational study was conducted in a picu of a tertiary care teaching hospital, to determine the incidence, etiology and risk factors for np. materials and methods: patients admitted to the picu, over a period of 1 year who had endotracheal (et) intubation, were enrolled consecutively into the study. demographic details were recorded at the time of inclusion. diagnosis of np was based on cdc criteria (1988). semiquantiative assay of endotracheal aspirate (eta) with a colony count of > 10(5) cfu/ml was taken as evidence of infection. colonisation was defined as isolation of organism with <10(5) cfu/ml. age, nutritional status, number and duration of intubations,  duration of mechanical ventilation, sedation, nasogastric feeding were the risk factors studied for development of np. intubation attempts of more than one were  defined as reintubation. risk factors found significant on univariate analysis, were subjected to multiple regression analysis to determine the most important predictors of np. results: the study group comprised of 72 children with a median age of 3.7 years and boys: girls ratio of 1.9:1. twenty two of 72 (30.5%) developed np; the predominant isolates from eta were acinetobacter anitratus(12), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), klebsiella sp(3) and staphylococcus aureus and e.coli(1) each. additionally 18(39%) had evidence of et colonization, with acinetobacter sp being the commonest 9(50%). re-intubation, prolonged duration of intubation and mechanical ventilation were the significant risk factors on univariate analysis for development of np. on multiple regression analysis, reintubation was the only independent risk factor for np(or 0.72, 95%ci 0.55-0.94). overall mortality was 21%(15/72);7(47%)of these deaths were secondary to np. conclusions: np developed in nearly one third of the intubated patients; gram negative organisms were the predominant etiological agents and associated with high mortality. re-intubation, prolonged duration of intubation and mechanical ventilation were the significant risk factors on univariate analysis for development of np. on multiple regression analysis, reintubation was the only independent risk factor for np.

AB  == the aim of this cross-sectional retrospective study was to describe clinical and  functional characteristics and the microbiological profile of an adult population with cystic fibrosis. the study was performed at the pulmonary diseases service of the hospital of the medical school of the state university of campinas. the charts of 54 adults (27 males, 27 females) with cystic fibrosis were reviewed. demographic, clinical, and microbiological data were collected. clinical and functional characteristics of patients with chronic pseudomonas infection were compared with those without it. the mean age of the patients was 41.8 years and the mean sweat chloride concentration was 106.4 meq/l. forty-nine percent had chronic respiratory symptoms only after 18 years of age, and 85% reported chronic production of purulent sputum. six percent had diarrhea or fat in stools, and no  patient suffered from diabetes mellitus. pseudomonas was present in 48%, and 73%  of them had the mucoid strain. others agents found were staphylococcus aureus (28%), hemophylus sp. (34%), aspergillus sp. (22%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia  (9%), acinetobacter sp. (7%), and burkholderia cepacia (2%). nontuberculous mycobacteria were found in sputum from 9 patients (11%); 34 patients (67%) had obstructive ventilatory defect; and 47% had obstruction and restriction. concerning the groups with and without pseudomonas colonization, only the values  of sweat chloride were significantly higher in chronic colonized patients. less severe phenotypes of cystic fibrosis may be found among patients previously diagnosed as having bronchiectasis. chronic colonization with pseudomonas aeruginosa in this study was not associated with worse clinical status but colonized patients did show significantly higher levels of chloride in sweat.

TI  == evaluation of biosorption potency of acinetobacter sp. for removal of hexavalent  chromium from tannery effluent.
AB  == two bacterial consortia were developed by continuous enrichment of microbial population of tannery and pulp and paper mill effluent contained serratia mercascens, pseudomonas fluorescence, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter sp. identified by 16s rdna method. the consortia evaluated for  removal of chromate [(cr(vi)] in shake flask culture indicated pulp and paper mill consortium had more potential for removal of chromate. acinetobacter sp. isolated from pulp and paper mill consortium removed higher amount of chromate [cr(vi)] under aerobic conditions. parameters optimized in different carbon, nitrogen sources, and ph, indicated maximum removal of chromate in sodium acetate (0.2%), sodium nitrate (0.1%) and ph 7 by acinetobacter sp. bacteria was applied  in 2-l bioreactor significantly removed chromate after 3 days. the results of the study indicated removal of more than 75% chromium by acinetobacter sp. determined by diphenylcarbazide colorimetric assay and atomic absorption spectrophotometer after 7 days. study of microbial [cr(vi)] removal and identification of reduction intermediates has been hindered by the lack of analytical techniques. therefore,  removal of chromium was further substantiated by transmission electron microscopy (tem), scanning electron microscopy (sem) and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (edx) which indicated bioaccumulation of chromium in the bacterial cells.

TI  == [ventilator associated pneumonia: confection of a strategy of prophylaxis and management based on the analysis of epidemiology].
AB  == background and objectives: variable magnitude of impact on the outcomes of the critically ill patients has been credited to ventilation-associated pneumonia, in terms of mortality, length of hospital stay and mechanic ventilation days. three  objectives have been defined in this study: mortality and incidence of ventilation-associated pneumonia before and after the implantation of a prophylaxis protocol (primary objectives); microbiologic mapping (secondary objective) as an instrument to optimize therapy. methods: a historical cohort was followed during the period of august 2001 to january 2004, fragmented in two segments, pre (until january 2003, n = 52) and post-implantation of the mentioned protocol, the analysis of mortality and microbiologic mapping been performed in the second segment (control group n = 39 and case group n = 14). results: the incidence rates from 2001 to 2003 were respectively 28.05 +/- 12.92, 22.45 +/- 10.18 and 10.75 +/- 7.61. the decrease in this rate after the intervention did not reach statistical significance (p > 0.4). mortality rates were 49% in the control group (ci 95 = 33% to 65%) and 43% in the case group (ci 95 = 14% to 72%), or = 0.88 (ci 95 = 0.26 to 2.94), without statistical significance either (p = 0.65). eight bronco-alveolar lavage were obtained (57%), 50% with multiple flora. pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in six patients (75%), acinetobacter sp in one case (12.5 %) and methicilin-resistent staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) in  one (12.5%). other gram negative bacilli producers of extended spectrum betalactamase (esbl) were isolated in two cases (25%) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia in another (12.5%). conclusions: the incidence rate of ventilation-associated pneumonia revealed a tendency to considerable reduction after the utilization of the prophylaxis protocol, while the results suggest no impact on mortality rates. further prospective evaluation of a greater sample is  required, in order to get to definite conclusions regarding prognosis. the isolated germs were, in its majority, high risk pathogens to multiresistance to antibiotics, pointing the necessity of knowledge of local susceptibility profile, so that an adequate initial therapeutic strategy can be undertaken.

(n=2, 3.3%), chryseobacterium sp. (n=2, 3.3%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1, 1.6%). although all the serratia, enterobacter, klebsiella and pantoea species isolates showed varying degrees of resistance to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime and cefotaxime, all were resistant to ampicillin. chryseobacterium and stenotrophomonas species isolates were resistant to amikacin, imipenem, gentamicin and ceftazidime, to which only three isolates of pseudomonas species were resistant. all the staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to methicillin. although there has been no major outbreak of a nosocomial infection in the hospital, it is strongly recommended that effective control measures (e.g., sampling the hospital water supply, disinfecting children's toys, use of appropriate hand washing and checking some of the disinfectants for presence of bacteria) are needed. these measures are necessary  to ensure that the antibiotic-resistant strains identified in this study are not  allowed to spread in the hospital.

TI  == [guidelines for treatment of pneumonia in intensive care units].
AB  == patients affected by pneumonia can be admitted in intensive care units (icus) independently by the setting where the infection has been acquired (community, hospital, long-term care facilities); even more frequently pneumonia can develop  in patients already hospitalized in icu especially in those requiring mechanical  ventilation for different reasons. within the severe community acquired pneumonia requiring admission in icu, the most frequently responsible micro-organisms are mainly represented by streptococcus pneumoniae, but also by legionella and haemophilus. pseudomonas aeruginona, anyway, cannot be excluded. the most recent  canadian and american guidelines for treatment of the above mentioned infections  suggest the use of a combination therapy with beta-lactams (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam) and a new generation macrolide or respiratory fluoroquinolone. in case of allergy to beta-lactams, the association fluoroquinolone-clindamycin should be preferred. whenever a pseudomonas etiology is suspected because of the presence of risk factors such as copd, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, previous and/or frequent therapies with antibiotics and/or steroids, the same guidelines suggest the use of an anti-pseudomonas beta-lactam (such as piperacillin/tazobactam, carbapenems, cefepime) associated with an anti-pseudomonas fluoroquinolone (high doses ciprofloxacin). an anti-pseudomonas beta-lactam plus an aminoglycoside or aminoglicosyde plus fluoroquinolone can be an alternative. early onset hospital acquired pneumonia (hap) and early onset ventilator associated pneumonia (vap) in patients without risk factors for multi-resistant etiological agents are generally sustained by s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, methicillin-susceptible staphylocccus aureus e gram negative enteric rods. these infections can be treated with one of the following antibiotics: ceftriaxone or fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin or ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) or ampicillin/sulbactam or ertapenem. late onset vap and hap in patients with risk factors for multi-resistant, by contrast, should be treated with a combination therapy: in case of defined or suspected p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae (esbl+), acinetobacter sp etiology, it is required the use of an anti-pseudomonas cephalosporin or an anti-pseudomonas carbapenem or b-lactam + beta-lactamase inhibitor associated with an anti-pseudomonas fluoroquinolone or an aminoglicoside. the possible presence of mrsa or legionella pneumophila suggests  the use of anti-gram positive antibiotics such as glycopeptides or linezolid. these quidelines confirm the role of ciprofloxacin combined with beta-lactams whenever p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae (esbl+), acinetobacter sp. etiology is suspected.

AB  == strain st15, isolated from soy beans, and identified as enterococcus mundtii, produces a 3944 da bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, propionibacterium sp., clostridium tyrobutyricum, acinetobacter baumanii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus caprinus. bacteriocin st15 is inactivated by proteinase k, pronase, pepsin, protease and triton x-114, but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, triton x-100, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta. no change in activity was recorded after 2 h at ph values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100  degrees c for 90 min. activity was, however, lost after treatment at 121 degrees  c for 20 min. the mode of activity is bactericidal. the highest level of activity (51200 au ml(-1)) was recorded when cells were grown in mrs broth, ph 6.5. bacteriocin st15 differs from other broad-spectrum bacteriocins described for enterococcus spp. by being active against gram-negative bacteria and by being smaller.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of phrygilanthus acutifolius.
AB  == ethanol extract of flowers of phrygilanthus acutifolius (ruiz & pav.) eichler (loranthaceae) inhibited the growth of both gram (+) bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus saprophyticus and enterococcus faecalis) and gram (-) bacteria (serratia marcescens, acinetobacter sp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa). this extract was bactericidal against staphylococcus aureus and bacteriostatic against pseudomonas aeruginosa. morphological evidence suggests that the extract  causes the swelling of the bacterial body of staphylococcus aureus, the disintegration of the cell surface and the cell death. bactericidal activity was  optimal at ph 7.5 and was not affected by different ionic strengths. the presence of mg2+ in the culture medium of phrygilanthus acutifolius diminished the sensitivity of pseudomonas aeruginosa strain against the extract. test results would tend to corroborate the folk belief that the flowers of this plant are efficacious against respiratory infections and would justify its further investigation.

TI  == [sequential microbiological monitoring of tracheal aspirates in intubated patients admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit].
AB  == objective: to evaluate, sequentially, tracheal aspirates from patients admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit and to associate these pathogens with length of hospital stay, previous use of antimicrobial therapy and diagnoses of ventilator-associated pneumonia. methods: the study population consisted of patients admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit, between november 2002 and december 2003, on ventilator support. three tracheal aspirates were collected serially from each patient. the first tracheal aspirate sample was obtained 6 hours after admission to the intensive care unit and the remaining samples were collected after 48 and 96 hours. results: one hundred patients aged from one day  to 14 years were assessed. positive tracheal cultures were observed to have increased in the three tracheal aspirate samples collected from each patient for  pseudomonas aeruginosa, from 6 to 22% (p = 0.002), and to have decreased for staphylococcus aureus, from 23 to 8% (p = 0.009). isolation of candida spp increased for the subset that had received previous antimicrobial therapy (p < 0.05). sixteen (23.5%) out of 68 patients admitted without pneumonia developed ventilator-associated pneumonia. positive tracheal aspirate cultures were obtained in 10 out of 16 of these patients: six were positive for staphylococcus  aureus (three associated with acinetobacter baumanii), two for klebsiella spp (one associated with enterobacter spp), one for pseudomonas aeruginosa and one for candida spp. conclusion: sequential evaluation of tracheal aspirates may be useful to track changes in bacterial flora at pediatric intensive care units.

TI  == [distribution and drug-resistance of 3 500 gram-negative bacteria in guangzhou].
AB  == objective: to investigate the distribution and drug-resistance of the common gram-negative bacteria in guangzhou. methods: from july 2001 to august 2003, the  resistance of 3 500 strains of common gram-negative bacteria isolated from 13 hospitals in guangzhou to 15 to 21 antibiotics was determined by standard kirby-bauer method according to the guidelines of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls, 2000). whonet-5 software was used to analyze the data. results: totally 3 500 gram-negative bacterial strains were isolated from 13 hospitals in guangzhou in the past two years, and the top 3 most common pathogens of them were escherichia coli (1 244 strains, 35.5%), klebsiella pneumoniae (900 strains, 25.7%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (547 strains, 15.6 %). the total prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls)-producing strains was 31.0% (1 084/3 500). the prevalences of esbls-producing strains in the escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter sp., other enterobacter sp., stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and proteus sp. in guangzhou were 38.7%, 37.9%, 5.3%, 55.2%, 8.2%, 27.7%, 33.3% and 9.2%, respectively. among them, 1 463 (41.8%) strains was isolated from the respiratory tract and 943 (26.9%) from the urinary tract. according to our surveillance, the clinical antibacterial drug with the lowest total drug-resistance rates of gram-negative bacteria was imipenem (8.7%) followed by cefoperazone/sulbactam (13.3%), while that with the highest resistance was ampicillin (90.9%) followed by nalidixic acid (69.3%). imipenem was the most effective agents against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter sp., other enterobacter sp., and proteus sp. isolated from 13 hospitals in guangzhou, with drug-resistant rates of 1.1%, 0.5%, 0.6%, 3.2%, 0.8% and 0%, respectively, whereas the most effective agents against pseudomonas  aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia was cefoperazone/sulbactam, with the  drug-resistance rates of 10.8% and 15.9%, respectively. most of the isolates were multi-drug resistant. the resistance rates of esbls-producing strains to 15 to 21 antimicrobial agents were much higher than those of non-esbls-producing strains (p<0.05). conclusions: drug resistance of the clinical isolates is a serious problem in guangzhou, and the increasing prevalence of esbls-producing strains of other bacteria should be given full attention. an unanimous and effective strategy for controlling this problem is urgently needed. imipenem and cefoperazone/sulbactam are the most effective antibiotics against the gram-negative bacteria isolated from the 13 hospitals in guangzhou.

TI  == new antibiotic agents: problems and prospects.
AB  == background: surgical site infections are the third most common healthcare-associated infection, often leading to prolonged hospital stay and excessive expenditures. management of these infections has become more challenging due to rising rates of multi-drug-resistant organisms and few new antibiotic options. methods: this paper reviews the literature, summarizes the epidemiology of surgical site infections and the threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and provides an insight into new treatment options for this condition.  results: patients with surgical site infections are at greater risk of acquiring  healthcare-associated antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) sp., and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-(esbl)-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. multi-drug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacteroides fragilis are also a growing problem. several useful drugs have recently become available for the management of serious, gram-positive infections (e.g., daptomycin, linezolid, telithromycin). tigecycline, the first-in-class glycylcycline, has broad-spectrum in vitro activity, including against mrsa, vre, resistant enteric gram-negative bacilli (e.g., acinetobacter sp.), "atypical" pathogens, and anaerobes. phase 3 clinical trials suggest that tigecycline will be an excellent option for antibiotic monotherapy for complicated skin and soft tissue infections (csssi) and intra-abdominal infections. oritavancin and dalbavacin, two novel glycopeptide antibiotics that are also in late-stage clinical development, appear that they, too, will be useful for csssi due to resistant, gram-positive bacteria. conclusions: multi-drug-resistant pathogens are threatening the success of available antibiotic therapy. many new options are useful for infections due to multi-drug-resistant, gram-positive bacteria. tigecycline is a promising new agent that provides coverage against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative, aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic strains, including resistant isolates, and may make broad-spectrum, single-agent therapy possible.

TI  == unique features revealed by the genome sequence of acinetobacter sp. adp1, a versatile and naturally transformation competent bacterium.
AB  == acinetobacter sp. strain adp1 is a nutritionally versatile soil bacterium closely related to representatives of the well-characterized pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas putida. unlike these bacteria, the acinetobacter adp1 is highly competent for natural transformation which affords extraordinary convenience for  genetic manipulation. the circular chromosome of the acinetobacter adp1, presented here, encodes 3325 predicted coding sequences, of which 60% have been classified based on sequence similarity to other documented proteins. the close evolutionary proximity of acinetobacter and pseudomonas species, as judged by the sequences of their 16s rna genes and by the highest level of bidirectional best hits, contrasts with the extensive divergence in the gc content of their dna (40  versus 62%). the chromosomes also differ significantly in size, with the acinetobacter adp1 chromosome <60% of the length of the pseudomonas counterparts. genome analysis of the acinetobacter adp1 revealed genes for metabolic pathways involved in utilization of a large variety of compounds. almost all of these genes, with orthologs that are scattered in other species, are located in five major 'islands of catabolic diversity', now an apparent 'archipelago of catabolic diversity', within one-quarter of the overall genome. acinetobacter adp1 displays many features of other aerobic soil bacteria with metabolism oriented toward the  degradation of organic compounds found in their natural habitat. a distinguishing feature of this genome is the absence of a gene corresponding to pyruvate kinase, the enzyme that generally catalyzes the terminal step in conversion of carbohydrates to pyruvate for respiration by the citric acid cycle. this finding  supports the view that the cycle itself is centrally geared to the catabolic capabilities of this exceptionally versatile organism.

TI  == antibiotic resistance among nosocomial isolates in a croatian intensive care unit--results of a twelve-year focal surveillance of nosocomial infections.
AB  == continuous 12-year (1990--2001) focal surveillance of the antibiotic resistance among the most common nosocomial pathogens (klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter sp., and staphylococcus aureus) in 1325 intensive care  unit patients was performed. the surveillance period was divided in three 4-year  time intervals (1990--1993, 1994--1997 and 1998--2001) and the prevalence of resistance was compared between intervals. specimens included blood, urine and respiratory tract specimens. the incidence and trends of resistance to six antibiotics showed inconsistent results. aminoglycoside resistance decreased among k. pneumoniae_isolates (gentamicin 83%, 72.7% and 49.6%; amikacin 50.9%, 51.5% and 18.2%) and acinetobacter sp. strains (amikacin 77%, 63.4% and 58.2%) but increased in p. aeruginosa (amikacin 27.5%, 63.3% and 44.1%). overall, resistance to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, and imipenem increased but imipenem resistance is still low, particularly among acinetobacter sp. isolates (0, 2.1% and 1.5%). however, imipenem resistance increased among p. aeruginosa (10.2%, 31.6%, 22.1%). the prevalence of methicillin resistance was high but did not change during the surveillance period (82.3%, 78.3% and 82.2%). the present study suggests a complex picture of the development of antibiotic resistance in a single icu. significant changes occur over time but they are unpredictable and do not show identical tendencies for different species and antibiotics.

TI  == monitoring of antibiotic resistance in bacterial isolates from bacteremic patients.
AB  == the aim of the study was to monitor the prevalence of pathogens and development of resistance in bacteria isolated from bacteremic patients. five university clinics and/or regional hospitals in the slovak republic participated in the study and a total of 421 isolates were collected in the second half of the year 2002. the most prevalent organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (19%), staphylococcus aureus (18.3%), among gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli (13.3%), klebsiella pneumoniae (11.4%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.8%) followed by enterococci, acinetobacter baumannii and enterobacter sp. all cons and s. aureus were susceptible to vancomycin; resistance to oxacillin was observed for 55% of the cons and only for 4% of s. aureus isolates. a higher prevalence of resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, gentamicin and ofloxacin was found in cons in comparison to s. aureus. enterococcus sp. isolates were fully susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin. gentamicin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, third generation cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin showed good activity against e. coli. although 17% of k. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, it was the most effective drug against k. pneumoniae; the prevalence of resistance to other antibiotics was rather higher. gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were the most active against enterobacter sp. isolates and ceftazidime and meropenem against p. aeruginosa.

TI  == cross-reactivity between related sequences found in acinetobacter sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, myelin basic protein and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein in multiple sclerosis.
AB  == to investigate the possible role of molecular mimicry to bacterial components in  multiple sclerosis (ms) pathogenesis we examined antibody responses to mimicry peptide sequences of acinetobacter, pseudomonas aeruginosa and myelin components. antibodies to mimicry peptides from acinetobacter (p<0.001), p. aeruginosa (p<0.001), myelin basic protein (mbp) (p<0.001) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (mog) (p<0.001) were significantly elevated in ms patients compared  to controls. antisera against mbp (residues 110-124) reacted with both acinetobacter and pseudomonas peptides from 4- and gamma-carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase, respectively. mog (residues 43-57) antisera reacted with acinetobacter peptide from 3-oxo-adipate-coa-transferase subunit a. the role of these bacteria in ms is unclear but demonstrates that molecular mimicry is not restricted to viruses suggesting bacterial infections could play a role in ms pathogenesis. further work is required to evaluate the relevance of these cross-reactive antibodies to the neuropathology of ms.

TI  == functional analysis of alkane hydroxylases from gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == we have cloned homologs of the pseudomonas putida gpo1 alkane hydroxylase from pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1, pseudomonas fluorescens cha0, alcanivorax borkumensis ap1, mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv, and prauserella rugosa nrrl b-2295. sequence comparisons show that the level of protein sequence identity between the homologs is as low as 35%, and that the pseudomonas alkane hydroxylases are as distantly related to each other as to the remaining alkane hydroxylases. based on the observation that rubredoxin, an electron transfer component of the gpo1 alkane hydroxylase system, can be replaced by rubredoxins from other alkane hydroxylase systems, we have developed three recombinant host strains for the functional analysis of the novel alkane hydroxylase genes. two hosts, escherichia coli gec137 and p. putida gpo12, were equipped with pgec47 delta b, which encodes all proteins necessary for growth on medium-chain-length alkanes (c(6) to c(12)), except a functional alkane hydroxylase. the third host was an alkb knockout derivative of p. fluorescens cha0, which is no longer able to grow on c(12) to c(16) alkanes. all alkane hydroxylase homologs, except the acinetobacter sp. adp1 alkm, allowed at least one of the three hosts to grow on n-alkanes.

TI  == pathogen frequency and resistance patterns in brazilian hospitals: summary of results from three years of the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program.
AB  == background: pathogen frequency and resistance patterns may vary significantly from country to country and also in different hospitals within a country. thus, regional surveillance programs are essential to guide empirical therapy and infection control measures. methods: rank order of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogenic species causing bloodstream infections (bsi), lower  respiratory tract infections (lrti), wound or skin and soft tissue infections (wssti), and urinary tract infections (uti) in hospitalized patients were determined by collecting consecutive isolates over a specified period of time, as part of the sentry antimicrobial resistance surveillance program (sentry). all isolates were tested by reference broth microdilution. results and conclusions: a total of 3,728 bacterial strains were obtained from january, 1997, to december, 1999, from 12 brazilian hospitals located in 4 states. the largest number of isolates were obtained from patients with bsi (2,008), followed by lrti (822 cases), uti (468 cases), and wssti (430 cases). staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated pathogen in general (22.8% - 852 isolates), followed by  e. coli (13.8% - 516 cases) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.3% - 496 cases). staphylococcus aureus was also the most common species isolated from bsi (23.6%)  and wssti (45.8%), and p. aeruginosa was the most frequent species isolated from  patients with lrti (29.4%). the main bacterial resistance problems found in this  study were: imipenem resistance among p. aeruginosa (69.8% susceptibility) and acinetobacter spp. (88.1% susceptibility); esbl production among k. pneumoniae (48.4%) and e. coli (8.9%); resistance to third generation cephalosporins among enterobacter spp. (68.1% susceptible to ceftazidime) and oxacillin resistance among s. aureus (34.0%) and coagulase negative staphylococci (80.1%). only the carbapenems (88.1% to 89.3% susceptibility) showed reasonable activity against the acinetobacter spp. isolates evaluated.

TI  == multiple organ failure in septic patients.
AB  == multiple organ failure (mof) is the main cause of death in icus, especially affecting septic patients. it is strongly related to number of systems with failure, type of system involved, risk factors such as age, previous chronic diseases, delayed or inadequate resuscitation, persistent infection, immune suppression, and others. the prognoses is worse for patients rather than in elective or emergency surgical patients. the objective of this article is to provide data from our university teaching hospital icu related to the incidence of septic patients, the distribution of mof, and distribution of failure among each of the organs. the mortality rate, relationship between mortality and age, and mortality and types of organs affected were evaluated. the main bacterial causes of sepsis were also identified. a retrospective evaluation was done of 249 patients admitted to the icu in a 4 month period during 1999. fifty four patients had sepsis diagnosed by accs/sccm criteria. there were 37 men and 17 women; 24 medical and 30 post-surgical patients (9 after elective surgery and 21 emergency  patients). apache ii score was calculated on admission and mof, measured for the  first five days, was diagnosed using marshall and meakins criteria. the statistical method used was non-parametric mann-whitney test, p<0.05 was considered significant. the incidence of sepsis was recorded in 54/249 patients (22%). thirty of these 54 patients (56%) died. death occurred in 2 of 11 patients with one organ failure (18%), in 14/27 with 2 or 3 organ failures (52%), and 14/16 with 4 or more organ failures (88%). none of the three patients 15 to 20 years old died, 17/32 (55%) patients age 21-60 years, and >61 years 13/19 (68%),  died. there were 23 patients with positive bacterial culture. the most frequent bacteria found were: pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), multiresistant acinetobacter baumanii (3), staphylococcus epidermidis (3), enterobacter aerogenes (3), klebsiella pneumoniae (2) and multiresistant staphylococcus aureus (2). the mean  value +/- sd of apache ii (mortality risk) for survivors was 21 +/- 18 and for non-survivors 42 +/- 26 (p<0.001). we conclude that mof due to sepsis in an icu is frequent, with high mortality related to the number of failing organs, age and high apache ii.

AB  == purpose: establishment of a new molecular biology technique for the identification of multiple bacteria from the ocular environment, which can be applied supplementarily to cultivation in cases of severe bacterial infections. methods: from 60 human conjunctivae (29 with purulent and 31 with nonpurulent conjunctivitis), swabs were taken and dna was extracted. fragments of 200 bp, spanning the v3 region of the eubacterial 16s rdna, were amplified by polymerase  chain reaction (pcr) and separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). for phylogenetic identification, dgge bands were excised and directly sequenced, or 16s rdna clone libraries were constructed and clones were screened  by dgge. sequences were compared with sequences of known bacteria listed in the embl database. furthermore, the results were compared with results obtained from  conventional cultivation. results: 16s rdna could be amplified from 25 of 29 investigated swabs taken from purulent conjunctivitis eyes and from 2 of 31 investigated swabs taken from nonpurulent conjunctivitis eyes. sixteen samples showed monomicrobial and 11 samples showed polymicrobial infections. the following genera (n is number of samples) were detected: staphylococcus (n = 8),  corynebacterium (n = 7), propionibacterium (n = 7), streptococcus (n = 6), bacillus (n = 2), acinetobacter (n = 3), pseudomonas (n = 3), proteus (n = 1), and brevundimonas (n = 1). four sequences could not be identified to the genus level. they had highest sequence similarities both to sequences of pantoea and enterobacter (n = 1), kingella and neisseria (n = 1), serratia and aranicola (n = 1), and leuconostoc and weissella (n = 2), respectively. culture was only positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9), corynebacteria (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), streptococcus sp. (n = 1), proteus sp. (n = 1), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1). in total, 45% of  the 60 analyzed conjunctival swabs were pcr positive, whereas only 22% were culture positive. no sample positive by culture gave negative results by pcr. conclusions: 16s rdna sequence analyses and dgge fingerprinting are appropriate methods for the detection and identification of monomicrobial as well as polymicrobial ocular infections of bacteria that might not be detected by conventional cultivation.

TI  == contemporary assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods for polymyxin b and colistin: review of available interpretative criteria and quality control guidelines.
AB  == the emergence of infections caused by multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa  and acinetobacter spp. has necessitated the search for alternative parenteral agents such as the polymyxins. the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) documents do not currently provide interpretative criteria for  the testing of the polymyxins, colistin and polymyxin b. therefore, an evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of colistin and polymyxin b was initiated using 200 bloodstream infection pathogens collected through the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. all susceptibility tests were performed according to the nccls recommendations. polymyxin b and colistin displayed a nearly identical spectrum of activity, exhibiting excellent potency against p. aeruginosa (mic(90), 2 microg/ml) and acinetobacter sp. (mic(90), 2 microg/ml). in contrast, they showed limited activity against some other nonfermentative bacilli such as burkholderia cepacia (mic(90), >/=128 microg/ml). excellent correlation was achieved between broth microdilution and agar dilution tests (r = 0.96 to 0.98);  94.3% of the results were +/-1 log(2) dilution between the methods used for both  compounds. at a resistance breakpoint of >/=4 microg/ml for both agents, unacceptable false-susceptible or very major errors were noted for colistin (5%)  and polymyxin b (6%). modified zone criteria for colistin (</=11 and >/=14 mm) and polymyxin b (</=10 and >/=14 mm) were suggested, but some degree of error persisted (>/=3.5%). it is recommended that all susceptible disk diffusion results be confirmed by mic tests using the preferred reference nccls method. the quality control (qc) ranges listed in the product package insert require an adjusted range by approximately 3 mm for both nccls gram-negative quality control strains. this evaluation of in vitro susceptibility test methods for the polymyxin class drugs confirmed continued serious testing error with the disk diffusion method, the possible need for breakpoint adjustments, and the recalculation of disk diffusion qc ranges. clinical laboratories should exclusively use mic methods to assist the therapeutic application of colistin or  polymyxin b until disk diffusion test modifications are sanctioned and published  by the nccls.

TI  == evaluation of the in vitro activity of two fourth-generation cephalosporins against bacterial samples isolated from patients in several brazilian hospitals.
AB  == cefpirome and cefepime are two fourth-generation cephalosporins recently introduced in brazil. they have a very similar range of in vitro antimicrobial activity, but some differences have been noticed. the goal of this study was to compare the in vitro activity of cefpirome and cefepime against bacterial samples isolated in brazilian hospitals. we studied 931 samples taken from hospitalized patients between april and june, 1998. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined by the etest method. the potency of cefpirome was similar to that  of cefepime, except against enterococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci, where cefpirome proved 2-fold more potent. the mic(90) for cefepime were inferior to cefpirome in response to klebsiella pneumoniae (mic(90), 24 and 96microg/ml, respectively), pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic(90), 48 and 128microg/ml, respectively), and other gram-negative organisms (mic(90), 64 and 256microg/ml, respectively). despite the fact that cefpirome presented a slightly broader range of action against gram-positive bacteria (90% sensitive vs. 78% sensitive to cefepime), and that cefepime presented an equally broad range against gram-negative bacteria (74% sensitive vs. 65% sensitive to cefpirome), these differences were not considered clinically significant because the sensitivity differed in mic by less than 2 dilutions. only 16 (1.7%) of the 931 samples tested showed a significant difference in sensitivity. this study suggests that,  except for acinetobacter sp. and p. aeruginosa, laboratories may routinely test only cefpirome and apply the same category result to cefepime. since category discrepancies are very rare and cefpirome is slightly less active than cefepime against enterobacteriaceae, isolates susceptible to cefepime will certanly also be susceptible to cefpirome. to optimize the treatment of severely infected patients, especially where species such as acinetobacter sp and p. aeruginosa are involved, we recommend that both cephalosporins be tested by using the same susceptibility test method to determine the mic.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of piperacillin/tazobactam in comparison with other broad-spectrum beta-lactams.
AB  == combining tazobactam, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, with the ureidopenicillin, piperacillin, successfully restores the activity of piperacillin against beta-lactamase producing bacteria. thus, piperacillin/tazobactam is highly active against most clinically important species of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including anaerobes. we evaluated the in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against clinical isolates from a tertiary university hospital located in sao paulo, brazil. its activity was compared to that of ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, aztreonam, and imipenem against 820 isolates (608 gram-negative and 212 gram-positive) collected from hospitalized patients in 1999. the most frequent species tested were pseudomonas aeruginosa (168/20%), escherichia coli (139/17%), acinetobacter spp. (131/16%), and staphylococcus aureus (76/9%). of the isolates studied, 30% were from the bloodstream, 16% from  the lower respiratory tract, and 11% from surgical wounds or soft tissue. the isolates were susceptibility tested by the broth microdilution method according to nccls procedures. the isolates tested were highly resistant to most antimicrobial agents evaluated. imipenem resistance was not verified among enterobacteriaceae, and piperacillin/tazobactam was the second most active beta-lactams against this group of bacteria (80.0% susceptibility). extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production was very high among e. coli (approximately 20%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (approximately 40%). imipenem was uniformly active against these species (100% susceptibility) and piperacillin/tazobactam was the second most active compound inhibiting 84.4% of isolates. pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly resistant to all beta-lactams evaluated and piperacillin/tazobactam was the most active compound against this species. our results demonstrate an extremely high level of antimicrobial resistance in the hospital evaluated, especially among non-enteric gram-negative  bacilli. due to this high level of resistance, piperacillin/tazobactam represents an important contribution to the treatment of nosocomial infections.

TI  == neonatal gram-negative bacteremia.
AB  == a 22 months prospective study of neonatal gram-negative bacteremia was undertaken in a 15 bed nicu to find out the incidence and antibiotic resistance patterns. clinically suspected 1326 cases of neonatal sepsis were studied during this period. more than 25% of the cases were microbiologically positive for sepsis. among 230 (67.2%) cases of gram-negative bacteremia, the predominant isolates were pseudomonas aeruginosa (38.3%), klebsiella pneumoniae (30.4%), escherichia coli (15.6%) and acinetobacter sp. (7.8%). fifty-nine per cent of the neonates were born in hospital while 41% were from community and referral cases. lower respiratory tract infection, umbilical sepsis, central intravenous line infection and infection following invasive procedures were the most commonly identified sources of septicemia. prematurity and low birth weight were the main underlying  conditions in 60% of the neonates. total mortality was 32%. increased mortality was mainly associated with neutropenia, nosocomial infection and inappropriate antibiotic therapy. resistance was increasingly noted against many antibiotics. the isolates were predominantly resistant to extended spectrum cephalosporins (25%-75%), piperacillin (68%-78%), and gentamicin (23%-69%). the commonest microorganisms causing gram-negative bacteremia were pseudomonas aeruginosa followed by klebsiella pneumoniae. the community-acquired bacteremia was mainly due to e. coli. the proportion of preterm and low birth weight babies was significantly high, and the major contributing factor in total mortality. sensitivity to different antibiotics conclusively proved that a combination of ampicillin + sulbactam with amikacin or ampicillin + sulbactam with ciprofloxacin is most effective.

TI  == intravenous colistin as therapy for nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == sixty nosocomial infections caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii resistant to aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, quinolones, penicillins,  monobactams, and imipenem were treated with colistin (one patient had two infections that are included as two different cases). the infections were pneumonia (33% of patients), urinary tract infection (20%), primary bloodstream infection (15%), central nervous system infection (8%), peritonitis (7%), catheter-related infection (7%), and otitis media (2%). a good outcome occurred for 35 patients (58%), and three patients died within the first 48 hours of treatment. the poorest results were observed in cases of pneumonia: only five (25%) of 20 had a good outcome. a good outcome occurred for four of five patients with central nervous system infections, although no intrathecal treatment was given. the main adverse effect of treatment was renal failure; 27% of patients with initially normal renal function had renal failure, and renal function worsened in 58% of patients with abnormal baseline creatinine levels. colistin may be a good therapeutic option for the treatment of severe infections caused by multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii.

TI  == [treatment of pneumonia in hospitalized patients--results of a multicenter study  using a fourth-generation cephalosporin (cefepime)].
AB  == objective: to evaluate efficacy and safety of cefepime in severe pneumonia of hospitalized patients. design and patients: a prospective, multicenter, open trial was performed with 148 patients (62 patients with nosocomial pneumonia; 34  with community-acquired pneumonia and 52 undefined forms). cefepime was intravenously administered (1,000 to 2,000 mg every 12 hours), and doses were adjusted for renal function. the efficacy endpoint was clinical response at 48 hours after completion of therapy. results: the mean age was 56.4 +/- 20.31 years. the most common bacterias isolated from patients with nosocomial pneumonia were: 5 (8.06%) pseudomonas aeruginosa; 7 (11.29%) pseudomonas sp.; 6 (9.68%) klebsiella sp.; 3 (4.84%) e. coli; 2 (3.23%) acinetobacter baumannii; 3 (4.84%) staphylococcus aureus; 3 (4.84%) streptococcus pneumoniae; 5 (8.06%) others. the  most common isolates from patients with community-acquired pneumonia were: 2 (5.88%) streptococcus pneumoniae; 1 (2.94%) s. aureus; 2 (5.88%) p. aeruginosa and 2 (5.88%) k. pneumoniae. clinical efficacy was demonstrated in 137/148 (92.56%) of the cases since improvement was obtained in 20.27% and healing in 72.29%. failure of the treatment was observed in 10 patients (6.75%) and one patient the evaluation was not possible. adverse events were reported for 5/148 patients (3.38%). conclusion: our data suggest that cefepime was safe and effective for treatment of severe pneumonia in hospitalized patients.

TI  == effects of cytokines and endotoxin on the intracellular growth of bacteria.
AB  == patients with unresolving acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) have persistently elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs and circulation and increased rates of bacterial infections. phagocytic cells hyperactivated with lipopolysaccharide (lps), which induces high levels of proinflammatory cytokines in monocytic cells, are inefficient in killing ingested bacteria despite having intact phagocytic activity. on the other hand, phagocytic cells that are activated with an analogue of lps that does not induce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines effectively ingest and kill bacteria. we  hypothesized that in the presence of high concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines, bacteria may adapt and utilize cytokines to their growth advantage. to test our hypothesis, we primed a human monocytic cell line (u937) with escalating concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), and il-6 and with lps. these cells were then exposed to fresh isolates of three common nosocomial pathogens: staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and an acinetobacter sp. in human monocytes primed with lower concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (10 to 250 pg) or lps (1 and 10 ng), intracellular bacterial growth decreased. however, when human  monocytes were primed with higher concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (1  to 10 ng) or lps (1 to 10 micrograms), intracellular growth of the tested bacteria increased significantly (p <0.0001). these results were reproduced with  peripheral blood monocytes obtained from normal healthy volunteers. the specificity of the cytokine activity was demonstrated by neutralizing the cytokines with specific antibodies. our findings provide a possible mechanism to  explain the frequent development of bacterial infections in patients with an intense and protracted inflammatory response.

TI  == nosocomial pneumonia in the icu--year 2000 and beyond.
AB  == diagnostic and treatment strategies in icu patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) remain controversial, largely because of the paucity of well-controlled comparison trials using clinically important end points. recent studies indicating that early appropriate antibiotic therapy significantly lowers mortality underscore the urgent need for well-designed comparative trials. when quantitatively cultured, bronchial specimens obtained by noninvasive techniques may provide clinically useful information and avoid the higher costs and risks of invasive bronchoscopic diagnostic techniques. previous antibiotic use before onset of nosocomial pneumonia raises the likelihood of infection with highly virulent organisms, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter sp. thus, the empiric antibiotic regimen should be active against these gram-negative pathogens as well as other common gram-negative and gram-positive causative organisms. promising preventive modalities for nosocomial vap include use of a semirecumbent position, endotracheal tubes that allow continuous aspiration of secretions, and heat and moisture exchangers. rotating their standard empiric antibiotic regimens and restricting the use of third-generation cephalosporins as empiric therapy may help hospitals reduce the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia caused by resistant gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == conversion of unsaturated fatty acids by bacteria isolated from compost.
AB  == a compost mixture amended with soybean oil was enriched in microorganisms that transformed unsaturated fatty acids (ufas). when oleic acid or 10-ketostearic acid was the selective fatty acid, sphingobacterium thalpophilum (nrrl b-23206, nrrl b-23208, nrrl b-23209, nrrl b-23210, nrrl b-23211, nrrl b-23212), acinetobacter spp. (nrrl b-23207, nrrl b-23213), and enterobacter cloacae (nrrl b-23264, nrrl b-23265, nrrl b-23266) represented isolates that produced either hydroxystearic acid, ketostearic acid, or incomplete decarboxylations. when ricinoleic (12-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic) acid was the selective ufa, enterobacter cloacae (nrrl b-23257, nrrl b-23267) and escherichia sp. (nrrl b-23259) produced  12-c and 14-c homologous compounds, and pseudomonas aeruginosa (nrrl b-23256, nrrl b-23260) converted ricinoleate to a trihydroxyoctadecenoate product. also, various enterobacter, pseudomonas, and serratia spp. appeared to decarboxylate linoleate substrate incompletely. these saprophytic, compost bacteria were aerobic or facultative anaerobic gram-negative and decomposed ufas through decarboxylation, hydroxylation, and hydroperoxidation mechanisms.

AB  == background: although gram negative as well as gram positive bacteria participate  in febrile episodes of neutropenic patients, in particular recently the ratio of  gram positive bacteria is increasing. the objective of the present work was to investigate the incidence and antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacterial agents in neutropenic patients. methods and results: the presence of bacteria was investigated in 446 neutropenic patients hospitalized at the haematological clinic in 1995. haemocultures (apparatus bact/alert 120, cultivation media organon-teknika) and urine were examined. the sensitivity for antibiotics was tested by the standard dilution micromethod. in blood most frequently staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated (45.4%), coagulase-negative strains of staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus hominis and staphylococcus saprophyticus (14.4%), acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii (complex 6.3%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.3%). in urine the following were detected: staphylococcus epidermidis (36.5%), enterococcus sp. (14.5%), escherichia coli (13.1%), enterococcus faecalis (11.6%) and enterococcus solitarius (6.5%). in all strains resistance to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic drugs was assessed. conclusions: investigation of the frequency of different bacterial species, along with monitoring of the resistance is an essential prerequisite of initial antibiotic therapy of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients.

TI  == [the role of carbapenems in the treatment of nosocomial infection].
AB  == carbapenems are active beta-lactam antibiotics versus most of the gram positive and gram negative microorganisms and anaerobes although their activity is lacking in the case of staphylococcus sp. resistant to methicillin, enterococcus faecium  and streptococcus pneumoniae with high resistance to penicillin and some gram negative bacilli which naturally produce an methaloenzyme able to hydrolyze them  such as stenotrophomonas maltophilia. imipenem, the first synthetized carbapenem  requires administration with cilastatin to avoid inactivation by renal dehydropeptidase 1. meropenem does not require being taken with the renal enzyme  inhibitor, with its activity being similar to that of imipenem. in abdominal infection the carbapenems have shown to be the authentic monotherapy in this type of infections being as effective as the different schedules of antibiotic associations normally used. treatment with carbapenems in bacterial meningitis should be currently limited to the cases produced by gram negative bacilli producers of wide spectrum beta-lactamases (wsbl), cases of meningitis by pseudomonas aeruginosa or gram negative bacilli producers of inducible cephalosporinase. meropenem is the carbapenem of choice probably in these cases because the carbapenems are often the only active antibiotics and meropenem, specifically, does not have the risk of convulsions observed with imipenem-cilastatin. the carbapenems have shown to be useful in skin and soft tissue infections as well as in obstetric and gynecologic infections as monotherapy similar to the schedules of the currently used antibiotic associations. in the case of nosocomial pneumonias, all the studies have evaluated the carbapenems in monotherapy as useful and effective, specially in the case of pneumonia by gram negative bacilli. finally, in non filiated nosocomial sepsis and specially in the case of neutropenic patients, the use of carbapenems is particularly attractive in gram negative sepsis in intensive care  units. the appearance in the last few years of strains of gram negative bacilli,  producers of wide spectrum beta-lactamase or stable repressed hyperproducers of class i chromosomic cephalosporinase, as well as other multiresistant gram negative bacilli, such as acinetobacter baumanii make the carbapenems, in many cases, the only effective antibiotic in this type of infections.

TI  == [the role of meropenem in bacterial meningitis].
AB  == meropenem is a new carbapenem antibiotic of with an antibacterian spectrum similar to that of imipenem, but from which it may mainly be differentiated by the possibility of its administration at high doses and it has no demonstrated proconvulsive effect, properties which make it applicable in the treatment of bacterial meningitis. the clinical and experimental experience in the treatment of bacterial meningitis with this antibiotic is herein reviewed. it has been observed that the efficacy and safety of meropenem in meningitis caused by n. meningitidis, h. influenzae and pneumococci sensitive to penicillin may be similar to that of cefotaxime or ceftriaxone in both the pediatric and adult population. there are very few reports on the treatment of meningitis caused by pneumococci resistant to penicillin. however, given that the activity of meropenem on these pneumococci is similar to that of cefotaxime and that the doses administered are much lower, it does not appear to be recommendable in the  treatment of this indication, although it should be tested in all meningeal strain to these characteristics isolated. it may currently be considered that the main indication of meropenem in the infections of the central nervous system is in nosocomial meningitis by multiresistant gram negative bacilli such as those of the klebsiella-serratia-enterobacter and acinetobacter sp. group. therefore a limited, albeit favorable, report on the clinical experience with meropenem is herein presented. meropenem may also be useful in the treatment of meningitis by  pseudomonas aeruginosa in which other treatments have failed.

AB  == background: the new cephalosporins with heterocyclic positively charged substituent at position c3 belong to the 4th generation cephalosporins. it is not evident, whereas these antibiotics are effective against cefotaxime-ceftazidime-resistant bacteria. we investigated the efficiency of the  cefepime (maxipime, bms) against acinetobacter sp., x. maltophilia, pseudomonas sp., flavobacterium sp., sphingobacterium sp. and against strains with production of esbl (extended spectrum beta-lactamases) (enterobacter sp., citrobacter sp., klebsiella sp.). methods and results: we determined the susceptibility of the 54  strains resistant to 50 mg/l and more of ceftazidime. the majority of the strains (35) are susceptible to cefepime and mic is the range 1.65-3.15 mg/l of cefepime. 17 strains have mic = 6.25 mg/l. two strains (one strain p. aeruginosa a one strain k. pneumoniae) were resistant to cefepime and mic = 12.5 mg/l. the activity of beta-lactamases was determined by quantitative macroiodometric method in one strain of p. cepacia and two strains of sphingobacterium multivorum. they  hydrolyse actively imipenem (they produce metallo-beta-lactamase) and ceftazidime (they are highly resistant to this antibiotic), but cefepime is more slowly hydrolysed than ceftazidime. conclusions: at the present time cefepime is effective against ceftazidime-resistant strains in so-called "problematic" species of bacteria. however, it is important to protect its efficiency in the future, this requires its rational use.

TI  == development of resistance during antimicrobial therapy: a review of antibiotic classes and patient characteristics in 173 studies.
AB  == the incidence of emergent resistance and clinical factors affecting its development were evaluated by retrospective review of 173 studies encompassing over 14,000 patients. eight antibiotic classes and 225 individual treatment regimens were evaluated. emergent resistance occurred among 4.0% of all organisms and 5.6% of all infections treated. it appeared to be significantly more frequent with penicillin and aminoglycoside monotherapy, with significantly lower rates associated with imipenem-cilastatin, aztreonam, and combination therapy. clinical failure also appeared to be significantly more likely to occur after emergence of resistance among organisms treated with fluoroquinolones or aminoglycosides. infections associated with higher resistance rates were cystic fibrosis, osteomyelitis, and lower respiratory tract infections. resistance was most common in patients in intensive care units or receiving mechanical ventilation. it was also significantly frequent among studies performed in university or teaching hospitals. organisms associated with high resistance rates were pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia, enterobacter, and acinetobacter sp. factors such as infection type, underlying diseases, type of institution, and specific pathogens  warrant consideration when examining emergent resistance.

AB  == a comparative study of colonisation of infection rates in mother and baby was carried out. thirty-two women were screened before delivery for the presence of micro-organisms. half of this sample delivered in water and half did not. the birthing tub water was sampled before, during and after delivery. the most significant finding was that most women and babies showed no evidence of clinical infection. however, large numbers of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter sp. were isolated from the water of one delivery; pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated initially from the ear and groin of the child and subsequently from multiple sites, including the umbilicus and 'septic skin lesions'. lack of adherence to the cleaning protocol for water births appeared to be an important factor in this clinical episode.

TI  == the danger of infections of the hospitalized patients with the microorganisms present in preparations and in the hospital environment.
AB  == two strains-s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus, resistant to antibiotics, were isolated from previously non-opened preparations made by the hospital pharmacy and industrially produced. after application in the surgery ward, two enterobacter agglomerans strains, resistant to antibiotics were detected in oral mixtures. the resistant bacteria, b. cereus and 4 strains of ps. aeruginosa, were also found in the purified water. in hospital environment 9 strains of staphylococci, resistant to the tested antibiotics were found. only one of them was s. aureus (detected on the wall), the others being coagulase-negative staphylococci. most of them were isolated from the floor, but  also from the wall, table and from the air in surgical and ophthalmological wards and in the hospital pharmacy. the most dangerous were three gram-negative strains resistant to all tested antibiotics. they were isolated from the floor (enterobacter cloacae), from the wall (proteus mirabilis) and from the container  with oral mixture in infant ward (ps. malthophilia). many strains resistant to many antibiotics were detected on the floor of surgical, nephrological and infantile wards as well as from the pharmacies: enterobacter cloacae (7 strains), citrobacter freundi, ps. aeruginosa, ps. cepacia (2 strains), ps. maltophilia (2  strains) and moraxella. many resistant strains were also present on the walls (e. coli, ps. mirabilis, ps. cepacia, alcaligens, acinetobacter). the resistant strains were rarely observed on the table, medical equipment and on personnel hands. klebsiella oxytoca and ps. paucimobilis were found on the table, ps. maltophilia on the dropper and on the rim of the container with oral mixture. acinetobacter and pseudomonas sp. were isolated from the medicine glass, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas sp. from the personnel hands in the pharmacies.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance problem in a university hospital.
AB  == in a study conducted in 1991 in the national university hospital, singapore, the  susceptibilities of a total of 2156 recent clinical isolates were tested against  25 antimicrobial drugs. the organisms were those isolated from routine specimens  received in the microbiology laboratory. about 40% staphylococcus aureus isolations in the hospital were resistant to methicillin. a high incidence of the resistance was noted among staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative staphylococci to antistaphylococcal drugs. acinetobacter sp. and klebsiella sp. are becoming major threats with regard to antimicrobial treatment as they are multi-drug resistant. pseudomonas aeruginosa did not show a resistance problem except to pefloxacin (74%). ampicillin resistance of acinetobacter sp. (93%) was  reduced to 71% by ampicillin/clavulanic acid and to 7% by ampicillin/sulbactam. with regards to the urinary isolates higher rates of resistance were noticed with pseudomonas aeruginosa to antipseudomonas drugs and for co-trimoxazole with other gram negative organisms, compared to non-urinary isolates.

TI  == the pattern of respiratory infection in patients with lung cancer.
AB  == we examined retrospectively the pattern of respiratory infection in 579 patients  with lung cancer admitted to nagasaki university hospital during the past 15 years. a total of 139 patients (24.0%) developed respiratory infection. the rates of pulmonary infection associated with large (36.2%) and small cell carcinomas (33.6%) were significantly higher than those with squamous cell carcinoma (26.0%) and adenocarcinoma (17.3%). advanced stages of lung cancer were associated with higher complication rates (stage i: 6.3%, stage ii: 15.9%, stage iii: 27.9%, and  stage iv: 33.8%). deceased patients showed a significantly higher rate of pulmonary infection than alive patients during the period of investigation. isolated organisms in excess of 10(7) cfu/ml in sputum or 10(4) cfu/ml in bronchial aspirate were mainly gram-negative bacteria (68.8%), such as haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter sp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the number of patients infected with gram-positive bacteria increased markedly after 1982. our results suggest that a successful control of pulmonary infection associated with lung cancer is important in improving the prognosis of lung malignancy.

TI  == cloning and expression of the polychlorinated biphenyl-degradation gene cluster from arthrobacter m5 and comparison to analogous genes from gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == arthrobacter m5 was characterized genetically to determine if the catabolic pathway (controlled by the bph genes), responsible for polychlorinated biphenyl (pcb) biodegradation in this gram-positive strain, was similar to the pathways characterized from various gram-negative bacteria. arthrobacter m5 was originally isolated as a contaminant from a culture of the pcb degrader, acinetobacter sp. strain p6. a bph-specific oligodeoxyribonucleotide (oligo) gene probe (bphc2) was designed by aligning the published sequences of two bphc genes (encoding 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase) and synthesizing a 29-nucleotide (nt) fragment from a conserved region of the gene. the bphc2 oligo was used as a probe to identify a 10-kb hindiii fragment of total dna from arthrobacter m5 and subsequently to isolate escherichia coli clones possessing bphc. the pcb-degradation genes were expressed in e. coli, but expression was increased by  subcloning in pseudomonas aeruginosa. the nt and amino acid sequences of the region corresponding to the arthrobacter m5 bphc gene showed a very high degree of homology with the published sequences of bphc genes from gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == antibacterial in vitro-activity of meropenem against 200 clinical isolates in comparison to 11 selected antibiotics.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was tested  in vitro by an agar dilution method against 200 clinical isolates (gram-negative/positive aerobes and anaerobes). meropenem was compared with imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin; and metronidazole, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, vancomycin when appropriate. meropenem and imipenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). only one strain each of enterococcus faecium and pseudomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia were resistant. of the carbapenems, imipenem was slightly more active against enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococci, but meropenem was obviously more active against enterobacteriaceae and clostridium perfringens. both, meropenem and imipenem had similar activities towards pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, streptococcus pyogenes and bacteroides sp. all other antibiotics tested were less potent than the carbapenems with the exception of ciprofloxacin  which generally exhibited similar antibacterial activities, except for anaerob microorganisms.

AB  == the structural gene coding for citrate synthase from the gram-positive soil isolate bacillus sp. strain c4 (atcc 55182) capable of secreting acetic acid at ph 5.0 to 7.0 in the presence of dolime has been cloned from a genomic library by complementation of an escherichia coli auxotrophic mutant lacking citrate synthase. the nucleotide sequence of the entire 3.1-kb hindiii fragment has been  determined, and one major open reading frame was found coding for citrate synthase (ctsa). citrate synthase from bacillus sp. strain c4 was found to be a dimer (mr, 84,500) with a subunit with an mr of 42,000. the n-terminal sequence was found to be identical with that predicted from the gene sequence. the kinetics were best fit to a bisubstrate enzyme with an ordered mechanism. bacillus sp. strain c4 citrate synthase was not activated by potassium chloride and was not inhibited by nadh, atp, adp, or amp at levels up to 1 mm. the predicted amino acid sequence was compared with that of the e. coli, acinetobacter anitratum, pseudomonas aeruginosa, rickettsia prowazekii, porcine heart, and saccharomyces cerevisiae cytoplasmic and mitochondrial enzymes.

TI  == aminoglycosides versus beta-lactams in gram-negative pneumonia.
AB  == newer beta-lactam antibiotics with high levels of activity against gram-negative  aerobic bacilli (including pseudomonas aeruginosa) such as cefoperazone, ceftazidime, imipenem, and aztreonam may be suitable for monotherapy of gram-negative pneumonia. aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin are also highly active against these same organisms and have been more extensively used, but are both ototoxic and nephrotoxic. key therapeutic questions are whether beta-lactams can safely replace aminoglycosides for the treatment of gram-negative pneumonia, and whether monotherapy or aminoglycoside and beta-lactam combination antibiotic treatment is superior. there is remarkably little definitive clinical data in the literature to answer these questions, but  available studies suggest that beta-lactam monotherapy may be adequate for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonias, but that combination therapy may be preferred for pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia sp, enterobacter sp, and acinetobacter sp, largely based on rates of bacterial persistence and emergence of resistance. at this time, there are more data available to support aminoglycoside monotherapy than beta-lactam monotherapy in gram-negative pneumonia and remarkably little data to suggest superiority of two antibiotics over single agents when they have been compared prospectively. thus, combination  therapy remains a conservative recommendation until better studies are available.

AB  == fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (ipm/cs) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. there were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9  with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with  fever of unknown origin. forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. the overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. the efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. bacteriologically, staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), streptococcus  pneumoniae (5), streptococcus pyogenes (1), other gram-positive coccus (1), klebsiella pneumoniae (8), haemophilus influenzae (4), pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), serratia marcescens (3), escherichia coli (3), branhamella catarrhalis (1),  citrobacter freundii (1), klebsiella oxytoca (1), enterobacter sp. (1), and peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. p. aeruginosa (3) and acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. s. aureus (1), s. epidermidis (1), p. aeruginosa (5), and s. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. the eradication rate was 83.7%. six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of s-got 2. but all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. these findings indicate that ipm/cs is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.

TI  == intravenous ciprofloxacin or ceftazidime in selected infections. a prospective, randomized, controlled study.
AB  == in a prospective, randomized, controlled study, the effectiveness and safety of intravenous ciprofloxacin was compared with those of ceftazidime in the treatment of tissue infections. a total of 52 patients received intravenous ciprofloxacin 200 mg twice daily (26 patients) or ceftazidime 1 to 2 g every eight to 12 hours  (26 patients). this was followed, respectively, by oral ciprofloxacin or another  suitable drug when improvement was seen. informed consent was obtained from all patients. cultures and laboratory determinations were performed initially and repeated periodically as indicated. both groups were comparable in age, sex, number of infected sites, and instance of nosocomial infections (27 total). severe infections occurred in six ciprofloxacin and 12 ceftazidime patients (p =  0.056). there were 13 patients in the ciprofloxacin group and six in the ceftazidime group with accompanying diseases (p = 0.032). patients were treated with ciprofloxacin or ceftazidime for infections of the urinary tract (eight and  two patients, respectively), skin or soft tissues (15 and 17 patients), pelvis (one and zero patients), lower respiratory tract (one and one patients), intra-abdominal (zero and three patients), and bacteremia (three and five patients). two patients in each group had two sites of infection. causative organisms were as follows: 15 gram-positive cocci (90 percent minimal inhibitory  concentration: ciprofloxacin, 0.5; ceftazidime, 16.0 micrograms/ml) and 55 gram-negative rods (44 enterobacteriaceae, nine pseudomonas aeruginosa; 90 percent minimal inhibitory concentration: ciprofloxacin, 0.25; ceftazidime, 8.0 micrograms/ml). resistance emerged in one patient treated with ciprofloxacin (acinetobacter sp.) and 12 treated with ceftazidime (four enterococcus, two staphylococcus aureus, six other). intravenous treatment was longer with ceftazidime (11.5 days versus 5.6 days for the ciprofloxacin group, p less than 0.0005), but the total duration of therapy was similar (12.9 versus 14.1 days, p  value not significant). resolution or improvement occurred in 23 ciprofloxacin and 26 ceftazidime sites of infection (p value not significant). death occurred in two ceftazidime-treated patients (due to bacterial infection) and one ciprofloxacin-treated patient (at the induction of anesthesia). adverse experiences were more common in the ceftazidime group as compared with the ciprofloxacin group (22 versus 15 patients, p = 0.026). ciprofloxacin eradicated  25 of 31 causative organisms, whereas ceftazidime eradicated 30 of 41 (p value not significant). intravenous ciprofloxacin was at least as effective as ceftazidime. patients treated with ciprofloxacin may need added coverage for anaerobes, but the drug's excellent activity against nosocomial pathogens and its availability in oral form allow for an early change to oral therapy without compromising effectiveness coupled with added savings and convenience.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == ceftazidime and cefotaxime--the clinician's choice.
AB  == a review of two third-generation cephalosporins, ceftazidime and cefotaxime, is presented. ceftazidime, often used as a single agent, has shown greater activity  than cefotaxime against pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pseudomonas species, enterobacteriaceae, acinetobacter sp, and enterobacter sp. it has been effective  as monotherapy in the treatment of peritonitis, gynecologic infections, chronic bronchitis, and infections in patients with leukemia and granulocytopenia, as has cefotaxime when in combination with an aminoglycoside. cefotaxime has shown good  activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacilli and against staphylococcus. it has been used in respiratory infections, urinary tract infections, and septicemia. in contrast to first-generation and most second-generation cephalosporins, third-generation cephalosporins have proven useful in some types  of meningitis. ceftazidime and cefotaxime successfully penetrate into the cerebrospinal fluid and cures of bacterial meningitis have been reported with both drugs. both ceftazidime and cefotaxime have been successfully used in children, infants, and neonates, as well as adults. safety profiles of ceftazidime compare favorably with those of other third-generation cephalosporins.

TI  == occurrence, transfer and mobilization in epilithic strains of acinetobacter of mercury-resistance plasmids capable of transformation.
AB  == a 7.8 kb plasmid (pqm17) encoding mercury resistance was isolated from two epilithic strains of acinetobacter calcoaceticus. the plasmid had a broad host range when mobilized by rp1, transferring into pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. putida, p. fluorescens, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris and chromobacterium sp. with frequencies ranging from 5.3 x 10(-9) to 4.6 x 10(-4) per recipient. the plasmid  could be transferred into a. calcoaceticus bd413 using intact cells of donor and  recipient bacteria (i.e. natural transformation) and there was a broad temperature optimum (14-37 degrees c) for transformation. transformation was as efficient in liquid matings as on plates but there was no effect of ph in the range 5.6-7.9. maximum transformation frequencies were obtained after 24 h on agar plates containing 3.5-10 g c 1-1 with donor to recipient ratios ranging from 6 to 415.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

TI  == serum bactericidal activity and postantibiotic effect in serum of patients with urinary tract infection receiving high-dose amikacin.
AB  == ten patients received a 30-min infusion of amikacin (30 mg/kg) on day 1 and 15 mg/kg on day 2. mean serum creatinine was 1.1 +/- 0.3 (standard deviation) mg/dl  before and 1.0 +/- 0.3 mg/dl 3 days after the second infusion. mean serum amikacin concentrations before, at the end of infusion, and 1, 6, 12, and 24 h after 30 and 15 mg/kg were 0, 157, 79, 31, 16, 5, 5, 85, 51, 19, 12, and 5 mg/liter, respectively. five strains each of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible and resistant to oxacillin, streptococcus  (enterococcus) faecalis, corynebacterium sp. strain jk, listeria monocytogenes, mycobacterium fortuitum (three strains), klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested.  serum bactericidal activities (sbas) were greater than or equal to 1:8 in greater than or equal to 80% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 30 mg/kg and in greater than or  equal to 60% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 15 mg/kg against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible to oxacillin, a. calcoaceticus, and k. pneumoniae. l. monocytogenes, serratia marcescens, and p. aeruginosa had lower sbas. very low or no activity was observed against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and streptococcus faecalis. the study of the killing rate in serum  confirmed these results. postantibiotic effect was studied by incubating a strain from each species in serum samples obtained 1 and 6 h after both regimens for 0.5, 1, or 2 h. the duration of postantibiotic effect depended on the duration of contact and the concentration of amikacin for the following organisms: oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci, l. monocytogenes, p. aeruginosa, a. calcoaceticus, k. pneumoniae, and serratia marcescens. m. fortuitum was killed after 30 min of contact. no postantibiotic effect was observed with streptococcus faecalis, corynebacterium sp. strain jk, or oxacillin-resistant staphylococci. amikacin at 30 mg/kg provided high levels and sbas against susceptible pathogens. prolonged postantibiotic effects were observed. no signs of nephrotoxicity occurred.

AB  == ciprofloxacin's in vitro activity was tested against 385 hospital isolates originating from three geographically distinct regions. of all strains tested, only three (1 acinetobacter sp. and 2 pseudomonas aeruginosa) were ciprofloxacin  resistant. ciprofloxacin was more active against escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, acinetobacter sp., proteus sp., shigella sp. than gentamicin, mezlocillin and cefotaxime. it was more active than azlocillin and cefsulodin against p. aeruginosa. it was more active than cloxacillin and cefamandole against staphylococci. it was as active as cefotaxime against klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens. ciprofloxacin demonstrated similar activity in broth and solid agar. the minimal  inhibitory concentrations (mic's) of all strains were similar to the minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc's). ciprofloxacin's mic was not influenced by increase of the inoculum or addition of human serum and only slightly influenced  by anaerobic conditions. decrease of the medium ph increased the mic substantially. ciprofloxacin exhibited a rapid bactericidal effect and had only a minimal post-antibiotic effect. these favorable in vitro characteristics of ciprofloxacin warrant further studies.

TI  == antibacterial activity in vitro and regression studies for ceftazidime and ceftriaxone.
AB  == the antibacterial activity in vitro of ceftazidime and ceftriaxone was investigated against 575 recent clinical isolates. both cephalosporins displayed  excellent activity against most of the pathogens tested, in particular gram-negative bacteria, including pseudomonas aeruginosa. apart from the pseudomonas group, acinetobacter calcoaceticus and campylobacter jejuni ceftriaxone was slightly to moderately more active than ceftazidime overall. ceftriaxone was moderately active against streptococcus faecalis. regression lines for the two antibiotics were almost identical. corresponding to differences in susceptibility, the zone sizes differed for the two drugs with respect to certain bacterial groups, e.g. pseudomonas sp. and enterococci. therefore, the two cephalosporins cannot substitute for each other in disc susceptibility testing. breakpoints for disc tests around 8-16 micrograms/ml, as suggested in the literature, appear too high considering the beneficial pharmacokinetic properties of the two drugs.

(mode mic: 0.25-0.5). mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode mic: 0.5) for haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. mics for meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode mic : 0.016); mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely,  from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci, except for enterococci, and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); mics for enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode mic: 1-2). except  for four c. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode mics: 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for b. fragilis).

TI  == [antibacterial activity of ceftriaxone].
AB  == in this study the author reports the main in vitro characteristics of ceftriaxone, a new aminothiazolyl methoxy-iminocephalosporin. the relationship between its structure and the antibacterial activity compared with cefotaxime reveals an expected longer antibacterial efficacy due to a long elimination half-life (8 h). it has been shown that ceftriaxone is highly stable against most either plasmid or chromosome-mediated beta-lactamases. several studies demonstrated that the spectrum of ceftriaxone included gram-positive cocci as well as most gram-negative bacilli even beta-lactamase producers; a variable in vitro activity against gram-negative aerobic bacteria (pseudomonas sp., acinetobacter sp.) has been proved, with a frequent synergistic bactericidal activity when combined with aminoglycosides, or with other beta-lactam antibiotics (carbenicillin, piperacillin). multiple pbps targets have been identified, including pbp1b, 2 and 3, leading to filamentation of e. coli, ps. aeruginosa and haemophilus cells. as a result, ceftriaxone displays a high intrinsic in vitro activity against troublesome strains and might be considered as a promising new cephalosporin for treatment of severe infections.

AB  == the in vitro activity of the novel monobactam antibiotic, ro 17-2301 has been compared with those of aztreonam, imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime and netilmicin. a total of 438 clinical isolates of aerobic gram-negative rods were employed and an agar dilution method was used for measurement of mic. ro 17-2301  was highly active against a wide variety of enterobacteriaceae species (mic range less than or equal to 0.03-8, mic50 less than or equal to 0.03, mic90 0.06 mg/l). the activity of aztreonam parallelled that of ro 17-2301 although the latter seemed to have more uniformly high activity against klebsiella sp. the other agents showed generally high activity against enterobacteriaceae except netilmicin against providencia stuartii (mic50 4, mic90 greater than or equal to  16 mg/l). activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. was more variable. ro 17-2301  and aztreonam were moderately active (mic50 2, mic90 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively). imipenem was the most active agent against acinetobacter, whereas  ro 17-2301 was moderately active. in conclusion, ro 17-2301 shows impressive activity against enterobacteriaceae and moderate activity against acinetobacter and p. aeruginosa. ro 17-2301 may well prove to be a useful agent in the treatment of gram-negative infections.

TI  == amifloxacin activity against well-defined gentamicin-resistant, gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == amifloxacin (win 49375) activity against a well-defined group of gentamicin-resistant gram-negative bacilli was compared with the activity of 11 other antimicrobial agents. for all strains, amifloxacin and norfloxacin were the most active agents, followed by cefotaxime and moxalactam. for acinetobacter sp.  only amifloxacin had an achievable mic for 90% of the strains. amifloxacin joins  other newly developed dna gyrase inhibitors as potentially useful agents for infections due to aminoglycoside-resistant gram-negative bacilli.

AB  == susceptibility of 16 056 strains isolated in 1982 and 1983 to fosfomycin (fos) was tested with mueller-hinton medium and discs 50 micrograms fos + 25 micrograms glucose-6-phosphate (g6p) (cutoff diameter 14 mm). for 3 411 strains, inhibition  zone diameters were recorded. almost all e. coli, citrobacter, salmonella and s.  aureus were susceptible to fos as well as 70% of serratia, e. cloacae, p. mirabilis and 50% of klebsiella and enterobacter sp. only 27% of p. aeruginosa, 20% of indole positive proteus and 8% of acinetobacter were sensitive to fos. e.  coli, citrobacter and s. aureus seem to exhibit the highest susceptibilities to fos. sensitivity rates of e. cloacae, serratia, p. aeruginosa, and especially klebsiella seemed slightly underestimated by the disk diffusion method, but differentiation between susceptible and resistant strains was facilitated by rating as susceptible those strains with inhibition zone diameters between 12 and 14 mm. this method also seemed to underrate the sensitivity of susceptible enterobacteriaceae, probably because of inadequate g6p concentrations at this point of the disk.

TI  == [in vitro activity of ceftizoxime on hospital bacteria. results of a multicenter  study].
AB  == the susceptibility to ceftizoxime of all bacterial strains isolated from seven university-affiliated hospitals over one month was tested with disk-diffusion technique. additionally, the mic of 1937 strains selected at random was evaluated by the agar dilution method. the majority of enterobacteriaceae are inhibited at  a concentration of less than 1 microgram/ml with a mode mic varying from 0.008 to 0.12 among the various groups. a few enterobacter and citrobacter strains are resistant. little activity was demonstrated by ceftizoxime on pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter sp. (mode mic 32 and 8 micrograms/ml respectively).  haemophilus sp. (mic 0.01-0.03) and neisseria (mic less than 0,008-0,016) are very susceptible to the drug. the mic of methicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococcus aureus varies from 1 to 4 micrograms/ml ; enterococci are less susceptible, whereas other streptococci and pneumococci have low mics (less than  0.008-0.025). the susceptibility of anaerobic pathogens varies widely between species, and within species ; mic ranges from 0.008 to 32 micrograms/ml for clostridium sp. and 0.25 to 128 micrograms/ml for bacteroides sp.

TI  == inhibitory and bactericidal activities of amifloxacin, a new quinolone carboxylic acid, compared with those of seven other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the activity of amifloxacin, a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound, against 147 strains of microorganisms was studied and was compared with the activities of cinoxacin, trimethoprim, amikacin, and four beta-lactam antimicrobials. the minimal concentration at which 90% of strains were inhibited by amifloxacin was lowest for escherichia coli and klebsiella sp (less than or equal to 0.125 microgram/ml), followed by proteus sp (less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml),  enterobacter sp and citrobacter sp (less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml), providencia sp (less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml), and pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia sp, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus var anitratus (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml). when compared with the ranges of activity of seven  reference antimicrobials, the range of amifloxacin activity was lowest for p aeruginosa, citrobacter sp, proteus sp, and a calcoaceticus var anitratus and similar to aztreonam's activity against enterobacter sp. for amikacin-resistant p aeruginosa, the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of amifloxacin ranged from 1 to 16 micrograms/ml. the mics and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of amifloxacin were similar. for all strains tested, microbial susceptibilities to amifloxacin were greater than those to currently available oral antimicrobial drugs, such as cinoxacin and trimethoprim.

TI  == direct dilution sampling, quantitation, and microbial assessment of open-system ventilation circuits in intensive care units.
AB  == in a systematic approach, 37 duplicate samples of open system circuits (bennett ma-1 ventilators) of patients in medical and surgical intensive care units were processed by direct and serial (apha guidelines) dilutions. the paired difference test on 15 of the in-use circuitry solution samples indicated no difference between the direct and serial dilution methods (p less than 0.001). seventy-seven additional respiratory therapy circuitry samples from similar intensive care patients were analyzed via a direct dilution method alone and processed microbiologically. the direct dilution procedure was a rapid and accurate means of evaluation of microbial contamination in the range of greater than or equal to 10 to less than or equal to 10(6) cfu/ml. high densities of organisms frequently  were found. sites of contamination included the proximal or patient end of the circuitry (heaviest), the nebulizer trap, and the distal or humidifier portions of the circuitry. the contaminants found were predominantly gram-negative nonfermenters: acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. antitratus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas maltophilia, and flavobacterium meningosepticum. fermenters were klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus sp., enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, and enterobacter agglomerans. infrequently, gram-positive streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus spp. were noted.

TI  == reliability of early identifications obtained with enterobacteriaceae-plus biochemical cards in the automicrobic system.
AB  == the automicrobic system (ams) is capable of identifying most enterobacteriaceae within 8 h and many glucose-nonfermenting, gram-negative bacilli after 13 h of incubation. early preliminary results can be readily obtained from the computer as the tests incubate. data with 1,023 bacterial isolates were reviewed to determine the relative accuracy of 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, and 13-h identifications. all automicrobic system identifications with probability (p) values of less than 0.80 were considered equivocal responses which needed supplementary tests before a final report could be issued. analysis of our data suggests that early identifications of morganella morganii, acinetobacter sp., yersinia spp., salmonella spp. (other than salmonella typhi), shigella spp. (other than shigella sonnei), enterobacter agglomerans, pseudomonas spp. (other than pseudomonas aeruginosa or pseudomonas maltophilia), klebsiella spp. (other than klebsiella pneumoniae or klebsiella oxytoca), citrobacter amalonauticus, serratia liquefaciens, or vibrio spp. should be considered nonspecific responses, even when p greater than or equal to 0.80. other identifications reported after 4 h were 96% accurate. at least half of our isolates (60% of our enterobacteriaceae)  could be identified reliably within 4 h, the remaining isolates required longer incubation.

TI  == in vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  == norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. we examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including  anaerobic species. it inhibited 90% (mic90) of strains of escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, salmonella and shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. the mics of proteus mirabilis, morganella sp., proteus vulgaris, proteus rettgeri, and providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 of serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. for pseudomonas aeruginosa the mic50, the mic75, and the mic90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic50 of pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the mic90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. yersinia, arizona, and aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was campylobacter. the activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the mic90s of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. all listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. the activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, ph, or inoculum size. there was no major difference between mic and minimum bactericidal concentration values. norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.

TI  == comparative antimicrobial activity of o-demethylfortimicin a, a derivative of fortimicin a.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of o-demethylfortimicin a (odmf), a derivative of fortimicin a, was compared with those of fortimicin a and gentamicin against a spectrum of 256 organisms. all three antibiotics were active in low concentrations against all strains of enterobacteriaceae, acinetobacter sp., and staphylococcus aureus, with odmf most active against proteus mirabilis,  indole-positive proteus, and providencia and gentamicin most active against other species. activity of each of the antibiotics against group d streptococci was poor. the overall activity of odmf was superior to that of fortimicin a for all groups of organisms examined and was most pronounced, approximately three-fold, against strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. both odmf and fortimicin a were resistant to the action of several aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes, with the  exception of 3-n-acetyltransferase-i. odmf and fortimicin a showed similar rapid  bactericidal effects at multiples of the minimum inhibitory concentration and equivalent synergistic activity against enterococci when combined with penicillin g. the combination of carbenicillin with odmf, fortimicin a, or gentamicin was synergistic for approximately 80% of the p. aeruginosa strains tested. inactivation of odmf and fortimicin a when combined with carbenicillin in vitro was minimal or absent, whereas gentamicin was substantially inactivated under similar conditions. odmf, fortimicin a, and gentamicin exhibited protective activity in mice infected with escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, s. aureus, or p. aeruginosa. gentamicin was the most active, followed by odmf and fortimicin a. the superior in vitro activity of odmf compared with fortimicin a against p. aeruginosa was confirmed in vivo.

TI  == intergeneric evolutionary homology revealed by the study of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase from azotobacter vinelandii.
AB  == protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (ec 1.13.1.3) was purified to homogeneity from extracts of azotobacter vinelandii. the molecular weight of the oligomeric protein was estimated to be 510 000 by gel filtration and 480 000 by ultracentrifugation. the oligomer appears to be formed by association of equal amounts of nonidentical subunits which were estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis to have respective molecular weights of 23 300 and 25 250. ten gram-atoms of iron was associated with each mol of oligomer. therefore, the enzyme appears to be a decamer with the structure 10(alpha beta fe). t-he amino acid composition of azotobacter protocatechuate oxygenase closely resembles the amino acid compositions of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenases from pseudomonas aeruginosa and thiobacillus sp. these proteins from p. aeruginosa and p. putida are known to be formed by association of nonidentical subunits of a physical size similar to the subunits of the azotobacter enzyme. furthermore, antisera prepared against the azotobacter oxygenase cross-reacted strongly with the isofunctional enzymes from the two fluorescent pseudomonas species. a weak immunological cross-reaction was observed when the antisera were tested against protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase from acinetobacter calcoaceticus. the results favor the conclusion that the bacterial protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenases were derived from  a common ancestral protein.

TI  == homology of the gene coding for outer membrane lipoprotein within various gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the mrna for a major outer membrane lipoprotein from escherichia coli was found to hybridize specifically with one of the ecori and one of the hindiii restriction endonuclease-generated fragments of total dna from nine bacteria in the family enterobacteriaceae: e. coli, shigella dysenteriae, salmonella typhimurium, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella aerogenes, enterobacter aerogenes,  edwardsiella tarda, serratia marcescens, and erwinia amylovora. however, among the enterobacteriaceae, dna from two species of proteus (p. mirabilis and p. morganii) did not contain any restriction endonuclease fragments that hybridized  with the e. coli lipoprotein mrna. furthermore, no hybrid bands were detected in  four other gram-negative bacteria outside the family enterobacteriaceae: pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter sp. ho1-n, caulobacter crescentus, and myxococcus xanthus. envelope fractions from all bacteria in the family enterobacteriaceae tested above cross-reacted with antiserum against the purified e. coli free-form lipoprotein in the ouchterlony immunodiffusion test. both species of proteus, however, gave considerably weaker precipitation lines, in comparison with the intense lines produced by the other members of the family. all of the above four bacteria outside the family enterobacteriaceae did not cross-react with anti-e. coli lipoprotein serum. from these results, the rate of  evolutionary changes in the lipoprotein gene seems to be closely related to that  observed for various soluble enzymes of the enterobacteriaceae.
