TI  == sunlight-induced rapid and efficient biogenic synthesis of silver nanoparticles using aqueous leaf extract of linn. with enhanced antibacterial activity.
AB  == background: nanotechnology is now regarded as a distinct field of research in modern science and technology with multifaceted areas including biomedical applications. among the various approaches currently available for the generation of metallic nanoparticles, biogenic synthesis is of increasing demand for the purpose of green nanotechnology. among various natural sources, plant materials are the most readily available template-directing matrix offering cost-effectiveness, eco-friendliness, and easy handling. moreover, the inherent pharmacological potentials of these medicinal plant extracts offer added biomedical implementations of the synthesized metal nanoparticles. results: a robust practical method for eco-friendly synthesis of silver nanoparticles using  aqueous leaf extract of ocimum sanctum (tulsi) as both reducing and capping agent, under the influence of direct sunlight has been developed without applying any other chemical additives. the nanoparticles were characterized with the help  of uv-visible spectrophotometer and transmission electron microscopy (tem). the prepared silver nanoparticles exhibited considerable antibacterial activity. the  effects were more pronounced on non-endospore-forming gram-positive bacteria viz., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and listeria monocytogenes than endospore-forming species bacillus subtilis. the nanoparticles also showed prominent activity on gram-negative human pathogenic salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and plant pathogenic pantoea ananatis. a bactericidal mode of action was observed for both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by the nanoparticles. conclusions: we have developed a very simple, efficient, and practical method for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles using aqueous leaf extract of o. sanctum under the influence of direct sunlight. the biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles making use of such a traditionally important medicinal plant without applying any other chemical additives, thus offers a cost-effective and environmentally benign route for their large-scale commercial production. the nanoparticles dispersed in the mother solution showed promising antibacterial efficacy. graphical abstractsunlight-induced rapid and efficient biogenic synthesis of silver nanoparticles using aqueous leaf extract of ocimum sanctum linn. with enhanced antibacterial activity.
