TI  - Subgingival microbiota in adult Down syndrome periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The subgingival microbiota in Down syndrome and non-Down syndrome adults receiving periodic dental care was examined for 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization and the results were related to clinical periodontal attachment loss. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 44 Down syndrome, 66 non-Down syndrome mentally retarded and 83 mentally normal adults were clinically evaluated. This involved, for each subject, the removal of subgingival specimens from three interproximal sites on different teeth; all subgingival samples per subject were then pooled and assessed for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial species using species-specific whole-genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Significant group differences in species proportions averaged across subjects were evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and associations between subgingival species and mean subject attachment loss within Down syndrome and non-Down syndrome subject groups were quantified using Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Down syndrome subjects exhibited greater attachment loss than non-Down syndrome subjects (p=0.05). Most microbial species were present in Down syndrome subjects at levels similar to non-Down syndrome subjects, except for higher proportions of Selenomonas noxia, Propionibacterium acnes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus oralis in Down syndrome subjects compared with non-Down syndrome study subjects, higher proportions of Treponema socranskii in Down syndrome subjects compared with non-Down syndrome mentally retarded subjects, and higher proportions of Streptococcus constellatus in Down syndrome subjects compared with mentally normal subjects. Down syndrome adults classified with periodontitis revealed higher subgingival levels of T. socranskii than Down syndrome subjects with no periodontitis (p=0.02). Higher subgingival proportions of S. constellatus, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, S. noxia and Prevotella nigrescens showed significant positive correlations (r=0.35-0.42) and higher proportions of Actinomyces naeslundii II and Actinomyces odontolyticus showed negative correlations (r=-0.36 to -0.40), with increasing mean subject attachment loss in Down syndrome adults. CONCLUSION: Individuals with Down syndrome show higher levels of some subgingival bacterial species and specific associations between certain subgingival bacterial species and loss of periodontal attachment. These findings are consistent with the notion that certain subgingival bacteria may contribute to the increased level of periodontal disease seen in Down syndrome individuals and raise the question as to the reason for increased colonization in Down syndrome.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the effect of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine on oral microorganisms.
AB  - The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effects of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine on the viability of some oral bacterial species. It also evaluated the ability of these bacteria to metabolize those substances. Single-species biofilms of Streptococcus gordonii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, or Fusobacterium nucleatum and dual-species biofilms of S. gordonii -- F. nucleatum and F. nucleatum -- P. gingivalis were grown on hydroxyapatite discs. Seven species were studied as planktonic cells, including Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces naeslundii, and the species mentioned above. The viability of planktonic cells and biofilms was analyzed by susceptibility tests and time-kill assays, respectively, against different concentrations of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine. High-performance liquid chromatography was performed to quantify nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine concentrations in the culture media after the assays. Susceptibility tests and viability assays showed that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine cannot reduce or stimulate bacterial growth. High-performance liquid chromatography results showed that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine concentrations were not altered after bacteria exposure. These findings indicate that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine, in the concentrations used, cannot affect significantly the growth of these oral bacterial strains. Moreover, these species do not seem to metabolize these substances.
TI  - Salivary microbiota of HIV-positive children and its correlation with HIV status, oral diseases, and total secretory IgA.
AB  - AIM: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and levels of salivary microorganisms in HIV-positive children, and their correlation to HIV status, oral lesions, and salivary IgA levels. DESIGN: Forty-two HIV-positive and 36 control children were clinically examined, had their saliva collected and processed for the microbiological analysis of 38 bacterial taxa by the checkerboard method, and salivary IgA quantification by ELISA. RESULTS: The majority of the species tested were more prevalent in control children than in the HIV group. Mean concentration of total salivary IgA was similar in both groups. High levels of Veillonella parvula were found in children with cheilitis and herpes. Tannerella forsythia, Eikenella Corrodens, and Propionibacterium acnes were prevalent in children with gingivitis, while Fusobacterium periodonticum, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus oralis were significantly more frequent in children with no oral lesions. Significant negative correlations between salivary IgA levels and Eubacterium nodatum and oral streptococci were observed (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: HIV-seropositive children presented significantly lower prevalence and levels of several bacterial species in saliva; HIV-positive children are able to mount a mucosal immune response; HIV-seropositive children under highly active antiretroviral therapy presented low prevalence of oral lesions.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of coaggregation-defective (Cog-) mutants of Streptococcus gordonii DL1 (Challis).
AB  - Streptococcus gordonii DL1 (Challis) bears coaggregation-mediating surface adhesins which recognize galactoside-containing surface polysaccharides on Streptococcus oralis 34, Streptococcus oralis C104, and Streptococcus SM PK509. Fifty-nine spontaneously-occurring coaggregation-defective (Cog-) mutants of S. gordonii DL1 unable to coaggregate with partner streptococci were isolated. Six representative Cog- mutants were characterized by their coaggregation properties with four Actinomyces naeslundii strains (T14V, PK947, PK606, PK984), Veillonella atypica PK1910, and Propionibacterium acnes PK93. The six representative Cog- mutants showed altered coaggregation with their streptococcal partners, A. naeslundii PK947, and P. acnes PK93. Based on the coaggregation phenotypes of these mutants, a model for the lactose-inhibitable coaggregation between S. gordonii DL1 and its partner bacteria is proposed. The potential use of these mutants in studies of oral biofilms is discussed.
TI  - Cytokine induction by extracellular products of oral viridans group streptococci.
AB  - During an etiological study of Kawasaki disease (mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome [MCLS]), we found that dominant viridans streptococcal strains on tooth surfaces and in the throat of both MCLS patients and non-MCLS control children formed erythrogenic and biologically active, extracellular products. In this study, we demonstrated that erythrogenic culture supernatant concentrates of representative strains (two Streptococcus mitis and two Streptococcus oralis), when injected intravenously, induced serum tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and gamma interferon in muramyldipeptide- or Propionibacterium acnes-primed C3H/HeN mice. The concentrates also induced tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-6, and thymocyte-activating factor (essentially IL-1) in murine peritoneal macrophage, human monocyte, and human whole-blood cultures. An erythrogenic, heat-labile extracellular protein fraction (F-1) that was concentrated from the culture supernatants of a representative S. mitis strain exhibited the above-mentioned cytokine-inducing activity. This partially purified F-1 fraction also induced thymocyte-activating factor and IL-6 in human umbilical vascular endothelial cell and gingival fibroblast cultures.
TI  - Ischaemic mouse thigh model for evaluation of pathogenicity of non-clostridial anaerobes.
AB  - A mouse thigh model has been devised in which the growing culture of non-clostridial anaerobe in the ischaemic tissue produces inflammatory swelling and death. The swelling of the right thigh served as an index of pathogenicity of the test strain in comparison to the negatively reacting left thigh which received injection of the control strain of Bifidobacterium infantis. Actinomyces naeslundii exceptionally caused death in all animals within 24 h. Mortality and thigh swelling were pronounced (greater than 75%) in case of Fusobacterium gonidiaformans and Propionibacterium acnes but less (less than 50%) in Acidaminococcus fermentans. High (less than 75%) rate of thigh swelling was also encountered in case of Bacteroides oralis, Bacteroides corrodens, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Fusobacterium plauti, Peptococcus prevotii, Streptococcus intermedius, Eubacterium lentum and Propionibacterium freudenreichii ss. shermanii.
