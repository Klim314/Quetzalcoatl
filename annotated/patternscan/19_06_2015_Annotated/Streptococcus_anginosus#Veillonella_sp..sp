TI  == [analysis of diversity of vaginal microbiota in healthy chinese women by using dna-fingerprinting].
AB  == objective: to analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora in  different physiological states with pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), to establish the basis for the future study of lower genital tract infections, and to provide a theoretical basis for the development of vaginal probiotics adapted to chinese females. methods: women who underwent routine gynecologic examinations in peking university first hospital from october 2009 to january 2010 were enrolled, including 30 at reproductive age and 30 at post menopause age. vaginal samples were collected and then total bacterial dna was extracted. universal bacterial primers were used to amplify the v3 region of 16s  rdna gene. pcr products were analyzed by denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). featured bands on dgge were recovered, cloned and sequenced. alignment with known sequence was made by using blast on genbank to identify bacterial strains so as to analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora  in different physiological states. results: (1) vaginal flora in healthy chinese  women at their reproductive age were relatively simple, lactobacillus were the dominant bacteria. common bacteria included: lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners,and lactobacillus gasseri. while l. iners were the dominant vaginal bacteria that could not be recognized by traditional method. (2) vaginal  bacteria in the women at post menopause age were more complex than in those at reproductive age. common bacteria included: lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus crispatus, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus gallolyticus, veillonella sp., streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus anginosus, prevotella sp., anaerococcus lactolyticus and bacteroides fragilis. conclusion: based on the dgge analysis, the most common vaginal bacteria in chinese healthy women at reproductive age are lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners,and lactobacillus gasseri. the most common vaginal bacteria in healthy post-menopausal women are lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus crispatus, escherichia coli, streptococcus sp., prevotella sp.,bacteroides fragilis and lactic acid producing veillonella sp. and anaerococcus lactolyticus. meanwhile lactobacillus iners was firstly found by dgge to be the dominant vaginal bacteria in different physiological states.

TI  == mechanical non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis: a single-blinded randomized longitudinal clinical study. ii. microbiological results.
AB  == background: peri-implantitis is common in patients with dental implants. we performed a single-blinded longitudinal randomized study to assess the effects of mechanical debridement on the peri-implant microbiota in peri-implantitis lesions. materials and methods: an expanded checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assay encompassing 79 different microorganisms was used to study bacterial counts before and during 6 months following mechanical treatment of peri-implantitis in  17 cases treated with curettes and 14 cases treated with an ultrasonic device. statistics included non-parametric tests and glm multivariate analysis with p<0001 indicating significance and 80% power. results: at selected implant test sites, the most prevalent bacteria were: fusobacterium nucleatum sp., staphylococci sp., aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, helicobacter pylori, and tannerella forsythia. 30 min. after treatment with curettes, a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotype a), lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus anginosus, and veillonella parvula were found at lower counts (p<0.001). no such  differences were found for implants treated with the ultrasonic device. inconsistent changes occurred following the first week. no microbiological differences between baseline and 6-month samples were found for any species or between treatment study methods in peri-implantitis. conclusions: both methods failed to eliminate or reduce bacterial counts in peri-implantitis. no group differences were found in the ability to reduce the microbiota in peri-implantitis.

TI  == characterization of the complex bacterial communities colonizing biliary stents reveals a host-dependent diversity.
AB  == this study provides a comprehensive survey of the spatial and temporal bacterial  composition of biliary stent biofilms. the bacterial diversity, distribution and  dynamics of 59 biliary and 4 pancreatic stent communities from 40 patients being  treated at two different hospitals, which implant stents either simultaneously or consecutively, were characterized by single-strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis. fifty-one phylotypes belonging to 5 bacterial phyla and 24 bacterial families were detected across 63 stents. this is a much broader diversity than previously detected through culture-dependent methods, particularly in regard to the diversity of obligate anaerobes. stent bacterial diversity was patient-dependent and more similar when stents were implanted simultaneously rather than consecutively. stent bacterial community composition differed between hospitals specifically because of the difference in abundance of bifidobacteria. co-colonization of veillonella sp., streptococcus anginosus and organisms closely related to fusobacterium nucleatum revealed a potentially important attachment and survival strategy that has yet to be reported in biliary stents. this work reveals a more complete survey of the identities of bacterial species that form biofilms in biliary stents, their co-colonization patterns and  the natural variation in species composition between different patients, hospitals and locations along the stent. consideration of the community composition from individual patients will allow tailoring of prophylactic antibiotic treatments and thus will make the management of stent biofilms more effective.

TI  == microbiological evaluation of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without sinus tract.
AB  == aim: to examine the microbiological status of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without a sinus tract. methodology: samples were collected by means of a size 15 h-type file and two sterile paper points from 30 cases of primary endodontic infections with (n = 15) or without (n = 15) a sinus tract. the presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: the species found at the highest levels and prevalence were fusobacterium nucleatum sp. vincentii, porphyromonas gingivalis,  veillonella parvula, enterococcus faecalis, campylobacter gracilis and neisseria  mucosa. total bacterial counts were similar between teeth with (44 x 10(5)) and without (50 x 10(5)) a sinus tract (t-test: p > 0.05). e. faecalis, streptococcus anginosus, capnocytophaga sputigena and capnocytophaga gingivalis had significantly higher counts in the absence of sinus tract (mann-whitney test, p < 0.05). higher levels of p. gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum were observed in cases with a sinus tract. leptotrichia buccalis (or = 1.83; ci 95%) and porphyromonas endodontalis (or = 2.15; ci 95%) were associated with an increased chance of subjects having a sinus tract. conclusions: primary endodontic infections were associated with a large variety of bacterial species.  specific differences between the composition of the microbiota of primary root canal infections were observed in cases with or without a sinus tract.
