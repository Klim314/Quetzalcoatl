TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == in vitro activities of rwj-54428 (mc-02,479) against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == rwj-54428 (mc-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with a high level of activity against gram-positive bacteria. in a broth microdilution susceptibility test against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), rwj-54428 was as active as vancomycin, with an mic at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)) of 2 microg/ml. for coagulase-negative staphylococci, rwj-54428 was 32  times more active than imipenem, with an mic(90) of 2 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was active against s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides (rwj-54428 mic range, < or = 0.0625 to 1 microg/ml). rwj-54428 was eight times more potent than  methicillin and cefotaxime against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml). for ampicillin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant and high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains), rwj-54428  had an mic(90) of 0.125 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was also active against enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-, gentamicin-, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. the potency against enterococci correlated with ampicillin susceptibility; rwj-54428 mics ranged between < or = 0.0625 and 1 microg/ml for ampicillin-susceptible strains and 0.125 and 8 microg/ml for ampicillin-resistant strains. rwj-54428 was more active than penicillin g and cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant, -intermediate, and -susceptible strains of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90)s, 0.25, 0.125, and < or = 0.0625 microg/ml, respectively). rwj-54428 was only marginally active against most gram-negative bacteria; however, significant activity was observed against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis (mic(90)s, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). this survey of the susceptibilities of more than 1,000 multidrug-resistant gram-positive isolates to rwj-54428 indicates that this new cephalosporin has the potential to be useful in the treatment of infections due to gram-positive bacteria, including strains resistant to currently available antimicrobials.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of cs-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cs-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone drug, was tested against 761 clinical isolates. cs-940 activity against members of the family enterobacteriaceae was most similar to that of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, with a large range of mics inhibiting 90% of isolates tested (mic90s)  of 0.015 to 16 micrograms/ml (median mic90, 0.06 micrograms/ml). cs-940 had greater activity than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin when they were tested against acinetobacter spp. (mic90s, 0.03 micrograms/ml) and stenotrophomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia (mic90s, 2 micrograms/ml). cs-940 demonstrated a high degree of potency against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and neisseria spp. (mic90s, < or = 0.06 micrograms/ml). cs-940 was two- to eightfold  more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. cs-940 was also very active against streptococcus spp. and enterococci, for which mic90s were < or = 2 micrograms/ml; for enterococcus faecium, however, the mic90 was 4 micrograms/ml. cs-940 was generally less active than a comparison investigational fluoroquinolone, clinafloxacin. this compound appears promising by in vitro test analysis and warrants further in vivo trials.
