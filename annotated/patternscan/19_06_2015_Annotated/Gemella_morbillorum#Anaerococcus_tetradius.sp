TI  == comparison of oral microbiota in tumor and non-tumor tissues of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma.
AB  == background: bacterial infections have been linked to malignancies due to their ability to induce chronic inflammation. we investigated the association of oral bacteria in oral squamous cell carcinoma (oscc/tumor) tissues and compared with adjacent non-tumor mucosa sampled 5 cm distant from the same patient (n = 10). by using culture-independent 16s rrna approaches, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and cloning and sequencing, we assessed the total bacterial diversity in these clinical samples. results: dgge fingerprints showed  variations in the band intensity profiles within non-tumor and tumor tissues of the same patient and among the two groups. the clonal analysis indicated that from a total of 1200 sequences characterized, 80 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected representing six phyla, firmicutes, bacteroidetes, proteobacteria,  fusobacteria, actinobacteria and uncultivated tm7 in non-tumor and tumor libraries. in combined library, 12 classes, 16 order, 26 families and 40 genera were observed. bacterial species, streptococcus sp. oral taxon 058, peptostreptococcus stomatis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus gordonii, gemella haemolysans, gemella morbillorum, johnsonella ignava and streptococcus parasanguinis i were highly associated with tumor site where as granulicatella adiacens was prevalent at non-tumor site. streptococcus intermedius was present in 70% of both non-tumor and tumor sites. conclusions: the underlying changes in  the bacterial diversity in the oral mucosal tissues from non-tumor and tumor sites of oscc subjects indicated a shift in bacterial colonization. these most prevalent or unique bacterial species/phylotypes present in tumor tissues may be  associated with oscc and needs to be further investigated with a larger sample size.

TI  == the subgingival microbiota of papillon-lefevre syndrome.
AB  == background: there is little information about the microbiologic profiles of periodontal lesions in papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls) and the significance of bacteria in the pathogenesis of periodontitis in these patients. this comprehensive analysis of the subgingival microbiota in patients with pls used 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) clonal analysis and the 16s rrna-based human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: thirteen patients with pls from seven unrelated families volunteered for this microbiologic study. subgingival plaque was collected with sterile paper points from multiple sites with >/=5 mm probing depth, and whole genomic dna was extracted. the 16s rrna genes were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. the samples were then probed for approximately 300 predominant oral bacterial species using the homim. results: the most commonly detected phylotypes in the clonal analysis were gemella morbillorum, gemella haemolysans, granulicatella adiacens, lachnospiraceae ot 100 (ei074), parvimonas micra, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. as a group, streptococci were commonly detected in these individuals. in the homim analysis, a total of 170 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected, with a range of 40 to 80 species per patient with pls. of these, 12 bacterial species were detected in medium to high levels in >/=50% of the individuals. the high-frequency strains were clustered into eight groups: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter spp., capnocytophaga granulosa, g. morbillorum, p. micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, streptococcus spp., and tannerella forsythia. conclusions: the subgingival microbiota in pls is diverse.  periodontal pathogens commonly associated with chronic and aggressive periodontitis and opportunistic pathogens may be associated with the development  of severe periodontitis in patients with pls.

TI  == prospective study of bacteremia and complications with eus fna of rectal and perirectal lesions.
AB  == background & aims: recent studies showed that endoscopic ultrasound (eus)-guided  fine-needle aspiration (fna) is a low-risk procedure for causing bacteremia and infectious complications when sampling solid lesions of the upper gastrointestinal (gi) tract. as a result, antibiotics are not recommended for prophylaxis against endocarditis. our aim was to prospectively evaluate the risk  of bacteremia and other infectious complications in patients undergoing eus fna of lower gi tract lesions. methods: patients referred for eus fna of lower gi tract lesions were considered for enrollment. patients were excluded if there was an indication for preprocedure antibiotic administration based on american society for gastrointestinal endoscopy guidelines, had taken antibiotics within the prior 7 days, or if they had a cystic lesion. blood cultures were obtained immediately before the procedure, after flexible sigmoidoscopy/radial eus, and 15 minutes after eus fna. results: one hundred patients underwent a total of 471 fnas (mean, 4.7 fnas/patient; range, 1-10 fnas/patient). blood cultures were positive in 6 patients. cultures from 4 patients (4.0%, 95% confidence interval,  1.6%-9.8%) grew coagulase-negative staphylococcus (n = 2), peptostreptococcus stomatis (n = 1), or moraxella (n = 1), which were considered contaminants. two patients (2.0%, 95% confidence interval, 0.6%-7%) developed bacteremia: bacteroides fragilis (n = 1) and gemella morbillorum (n = 1). no signs or symptoms of infection developed in any patient. conclusions: eus fna of solid lesions in the lower gi tract should be considered a low-risk procedure for infectious complications that does not warrant prophylactic administration of antibiotics for the prevention of bacterial endocarditis.

TI  == coaggregation profiles of the microflora from root surface caries lesions.
AB  == bacterial coaggregation reactions between different species and the auto aggregation of the same species are associated with the initiation and development of dental plaque and biofilms. as no such data is available on isolates from root caries lesions, we evaluated, by a visual, semi-quantitative scoring system and a spectrophotometric, quantitative assay, the coaggregation of 22 different wild-type microbial species comprising ten bacterial genera and a single candida spp. the quantitative coaggregation assay we used proved to be a more sensitive method than the semi-quantitative, visual evaluation as the results yielded the percent coaggregation. fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus bovis ii/2 and gemella morbillorum were observed having higher degrees of autoaggregation than the other examined strains. significant levels of inter-species coaggregation was seen between: (1) actinomyces spp. and veillonella spp.; (2) actinomyces israelii and peptostreptococcus prevotii; (3) campylobacter gracilis and actinomyces spp.; (4) prevotella intermedia and nine different species; and (5) fusobacterium nucleatum and six other species. the single candida albicans isolate did not coaggregate to a significant extent with any of the 21 bacterial isolates studied. scanning electron microscopy observation of the coaggregation interactions between bacterial pairs having strong coaggregation reactions revealed varying adhesive patterns. our findings on coaggregation amongst these isolates imply existence of multiple interactions between the coaggregation-inducing bacterial species in root caries. in particular, actinomyces spp., veillonella spp., prevotella spp. and fusobacterium spp. appear to play a significant role in this context.

TI  == antibiotic resistance profile of the subgingival microbiota following systemic or local tetracycline therapy.
AB  == background: tetracyclines have been extensively used as adjunctives to conventional periodontal therapy. emergence of resistant strains, however, has been reported. this study evaluated longitudinally the tetracycline resistance patterns of the subgingival microbiota of periodontitis subjects treated with systemic or local tetracycline therapy+scaling and root planing (srp). methods: thirty chronic periodontitis patients were randomly assigned to three groups: srp+500 mg of systemic tetracycline twice/day for 14 days; srp alone and srp+tetracycline fibers (actsite) at four selected sites for 10 days. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from four sites with probing pocket depths (ppd)> or =6 mm in each patient at baseline, 1 week, 3, 6 and 12 months post-therapy. samples were dispersed and diluted in pre-reduced anaerobically sterilized ringer's solution, plated on trypticase soy agar (tsa)+5% blood with or without 4 microg/ml of tetracycline and incubated anaerobically for 10 days. the percentage of resistant microorganisms were determined and the isolates identified by dna probes and the checkerboard method. significance of differences among and within  groups over time was sought using the kruskal-wallis and friedman tests, respectively. results: the percentage of resistant microorganisms increased significantly at 1 week in the tetracycline groups, but dropped to baseline levels over time. the srp+actsite group presented the lowest proportions of resistant species at 6 and 12 months. no significant changes were observed in the srp group. the predominant tetracycline-resistant species included streptococcus  spp., veillonela parvula, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, gemella morbillorum and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa). a high percentage of sites with resistant aa, porphyromonas gingivalis and tanerella forsythensis was observed in all groups at baseline. however, t. forsythensis was not detected in any group and p. gingivalis was not present in the srp+actsite group at 1 year post-therapy. aa was still frequently detected in all groups after therapy. however, the greatest reduction was observed in the srp+actsite group. conclusion: local or systemically administered tetracycline results in transitory selection of subgingival species intrinsically resistant to this drug. although the percentage of sites harboring periodontal pathogens resistant to tetracycline were quite elevated in this population, both therapies were effective in reducing their prevalence over time.

TI  == bacteriological study of root canals associated with periapical abscesses.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to identify microorganisms from root canals  with periapical abscesses and to ascertain the susceptibility of peptostreptococcus prevotii and fusobacterium necrophorum to antimicrobials. study design thirty root canals were microbiologically sampled by using sterile paper points. the concomitant microorganisms were identified through the use of established methods. the susceptibility of p prevotii and f necrophorum to antimicrobials was evaluated by using the e test method. results: a total of 117  different bacterial strains were recovered, including 75 strict anaerobes or microphilic species. the most frequently isolated strict anaerobes were p prevotii, peptostreptococcus micros, and f necrophorum. facultative bacteria such as gemella morbillorum and streptococcus mitis were also found, albeit less frequently. the data revealed that p prevotii and f necrophorum were susceptible  to the tested antibiotics. conclusions: gram-positive anaerobic bacteria predominate in the mixed microbiota of root canals with periapical abscesses. moreover, p prevotii and f necrophorum are susceptible to the tested antibiotics.

TI  == bacteriology and antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive cocci isolated from pus specimens of orofacial odontogenic infections.
AB  == we recently reported the beta-lactamase production and antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic gram-negative rods isolated from pus specimens of 93  orofacial odontogenic infections. in this report, we determine the bacteriology and antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria other than anaerobic gram-negative rods, mainly gram-positive cocci, isolated from the same specimens. streptococcus constellatus and peptostreptococcus micros were frequent isolates from all types  of infection examined. peptostreptococcus prevotii, corynebacterium species, and  eubacterium species were recovered only from dentoalveolar infections, while gemella morbillorum was found more frequently in periodontitis than in the other  infections. beta-lactamase-positive strains were detected only in staphylococci.  ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefazolin, cefotaxime, imipenem, erythromycin,  clindamycin and levofloxacin showed high susceptibility rates (> or = 77%) against viridans streptococci, peptostreptococcus and gemella. minocycline showed a high mic90 value against viridans streptococci (32 microg/ml), and metronidazole was effective against peptostreptococcus and gemella. these results provide useful information for the treatment of orofacial odontogenic infections.

TI  == association of early onset periodontitis microbiota with aspartate aminotransferase activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == objectives: the objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the activity of the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (ast) in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) using the colorimetric periogard (ptm) test and the subgingival microflora in early onset periodontitis lesions. material and methods: the study population consisted of 25 otherwise healthy individuals exhibiting early onset periodontitis (eop). in each patient four experimental sites were identified comprising one deep periodontal pocket (pd >5 mm) randomly  chosen in each quadrant. bacterial samples were obtained from the experimental sites, consecutively cultured anaerobically and in 10% co(2) using selective and  nonselective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional  biochemical tests and various identification kits. clinical measurements as well  as ast activity, assessed either as positive or negative using the ptm, were recorded at the same sites. results: sixty-two sites exhibited ast positive and 38 ast negative activity. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann whitney u-test) showed that streptococcus intermedius, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides forsythus, camplobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus and selenomonas sputigena were significantly higher in sites with ast-positive activity. the odds ratio of having high prevalence of s. intermedius, p. micros, c. concisus, b. forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus and s.  sputigena in the presence of a positive ast site was very high (range: 3.5-17.0). streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, gemella morbillorum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium varium, eubacterium lentum and prevotella oralis were detected in significantly higher proportions in sites with ast negative activity and manifested a negative odds ratio in the presence of ast positive sites. the logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking and bleeding upon probing showed a significant association with ast activity, while plaque and suppuration were not found to be significant predictors of ast activity. the co-infection of porphyromonas gingivalis, b. forsythus and p. micros, or p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and c. rectus were found  to be significantly associated with the ast activity (p<0.001). ast positive sites revealed significantly higher occurrence of co-infections by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. sputigena or by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. intermedius than ast negative sites (p<0.001). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. naeslundii co-infection was found significantly higher in the ast negative sites (p<0.001).  conclusions: the present study found a high level of agreement between the presence of putative periodontal pathogens and positive ast scores at periodontal sites that clinically were considered to be potentially disease active. prospective studies should be performed to confirm the findings.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  == eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. the aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). the samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. forty-one different microbial species were isolated. gemella morbillorum and peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while p. micros, streptococcus intermedius, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loeschei, p. melaninogenica and selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. the bacterial species s. constellatus, g. morbillorum and p. magnus were  isolated in greater numbers in incisors and p. micros, s. intermedius, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides egertheii, b. forsythus, p. oralis and s. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. cluster i was predominated by s. constellatus, s. mitis, s. sanguis, g. morbillorum, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; cluster ii was predominated by s. sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea and p. intermedia; cluster iii was predominated by s. mitis, c. ochracea, f. nucleatum,  p. loeschei, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; and finally cluster iv was predominated by s. sanguis, c. gingivalis, veillonella parvula, campylobacter gracilis, f. nucleatum and p. intermedia. the bacterial species s. constellatus,  p. micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, eikenella corrodens and f. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while s. intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of cefmenoxime against recent fresh clinical isolates from patients in sinusitis].
AB  == in order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (cmx), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cmx and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates from patients of sinusitis that were obtained in our laboratory from october of 1993 to march of 1994. the results are summarized as follows; 1.  cmx showed strong antimicrobial activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis that were 3 major aerobic bacteria from sinusitis. antimicrobial activities of cmx against benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp) and pcg-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) were stronger than those of ampicillin (abpc), and these strong activities suggested that cmx might have strong antimicrobial activities against  beta-lactamase producing h. influenzae and m. (b.) catarrhalis. 2. antimicrobial  activities of cmx against microaerophiles, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus intermedius and gemella morbillorum and against peptostreptococcus  spp., from chronic sinusitis and odontogenic maxillary sinusitis, were stronger than those of most of the control drugs. 3. the mic90's of cmx against isolates from patients of sinusitis were < or = 0.025-0.39 micrograms/ml. these values were lower than transitional concentrations in mucous membrane of maxillary sinus obtained when "1% cmx nasal solution" was used with nebulizer. it appears likely  that sufficient concentrations exceeding mics against main organisms would be obtained by nebulizer treatment using cmx nasal solution.

TI  == recent taxonomic changes for anaerobic gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms.
AB  == the strains formerly classified as streptococcus anginosus or "streptococcus milleri" have now been recognized as three distinct species, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, and streptococcus intermedius. streptococcus morbillorum has been transferred into the genus gemella. four new species within the genus peptostreptococcus were recently named. a recent addition to the genus clostridium is clostridium argentinense, which includes clostridium botulinum type g. two new species of actinomyces have been introduced: actinomyces georgiae and actinomyces gerencseriae. arachnia propionica was shown to be related to propionibacteria and has been renamed propionibacterium propionicum. eubacterium yurii was named to contain "test-tube  brush" bacteria found in subgingival plaque. lactobacillus uli and lactobacillus  rimae are obligately anaerobic lactobacilli found in periodontal pockets. bilophila is a new genus of gram-negative bacilli. wolinella recta and wolinella  curva are now included in the genus campylobacter. the taxonomic position of mobiluncus, currently assigned to the family bacteroidaceae, remains uncertain.
