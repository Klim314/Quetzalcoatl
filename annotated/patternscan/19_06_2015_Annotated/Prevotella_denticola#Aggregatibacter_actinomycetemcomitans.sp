TI  == evaluation of a hydrophobic gel adhering to the gingiva in comparison with a standard water-soluble 1% chlorhexidine gel after scaling and root planing in patients with moderate chronic periodontitis. a randomized clinical trial.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the clinical, microbiological and enzymatic activity of a hydrophobic chlorhexidine-based gingiva-adhering gel containing herbal ingredients, compared with a commercially available 1% chlorhexidine water-soluble gel, during non-surgical therapy of moderate chronic periodontitis. methods: a total of 34 subjects participated in this 6-month blinded randomized parallel controlled trial (isrctn35210084). after scaling and root planing (srp), test group received the gel, by rubbing on the gingiva, once every second day, for 14 days. the control group received the control gel twice daily. clinical parameters considered were the approximal plaque index, simplified oral hygiene index, modified gingival index, bleeding on probing, probing depth and clinical attachment level (primary outcome), assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months, together with the frequency of detection of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.), prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola (t.d.), tannerella forsythia (t.f.), and activity of neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase (secondary outcomes). results: at 3 and 6 months, all clinical parameters improved significantly, without significant intergroup differences, except ohi-s, which improved at 3 months (p < 0.05). microbiological data resulted in no significant intergroup differences at baseline and 6 months. at 3 months, significant differences for p.g., t.f. and t.d. were noted. a significant reduction of neutrophil elastase after 3 and 6 months was observed (p < 0.005), without significant intergroup differences. for  myeloperoxidase, significant reductions were noted in both groups (p < 0.005 and  p < 0.05), but no significant intergroup differences. the tested product seemed to have an increased efficacy, due to longer persistence on the gingiva, with reduced application frequency. conclusions: both products had a relatively similar influence on the clinical, microbiological and enzymatic outcomes at 3 and 6 months after srp.

TI  == periodontitis associated with plasminogen deficiency: a case report.
AB  == background: plasminogen deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disease, which is associated with aggressive periodontitis and gingival enlargement. previously  described treatments of plasminogen deficiency associated periodontitis have shown limited success. this is the first case report indicating a successful therapy approach consisting of a non-surgical supra- and subgingival debridement  in combination with an adjunctive systemic antibiotic therapy and a strict supportive periodontal regimen over an observation period of 4 years. case presentation: the intraoral examination of a 17-year-old turkish female with severe plasminogen deficiency revealed generalized increased pocket probing depths ranging from 6 to 9 mm, bleeding on probing over 30%, generalized tooth mobility, and gingival hyperplasia. alveolar bone loss ranged from 30% to 50%. clinical attachment loss corresponded to pocket probing depths. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, prevotella  intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and eikenella corrodens have been detected by realtime polymerase chain reaction. periodontal treatment consisted of full mouth disinfection and adjunctive systemic administration of amoxicillin (500 mg tid) and metronidazole (400 mg tid). a strict supportive periodontal therapy regimen every three month in terms of supra- and subgingival debridement was rendered. the reported therapy has significantly improved periodontal health and arrested disease progression. intraoral examination at the end of the observation period 3.5 years after non-surgical periodontal therapy showed generalized decreased pocket probing depths ranging from 1 to 6 mm, bleeding on probing lower 30%, and  tooth mobility class i and ii. furthermore, microbiological analysis shows the absence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola after therapy. conclusion: adjunctive antibiotic treatment may alter the oral microbiome and thus, the inflammatory response of periodontal disease associated to plasminogen deficiency and diminishes the risk of pseudomembrane formation and progressive attachment loss. this case report indicates that patients with plasminogen deficiency may benefit from non-surgical periodontal treatment in combination with an adjunctive antibiotic therapy and a strict supportive periodontal therapy regimen.

TI  == occurrence of periodontal pathogens in ethnic groups from a native brazilian reservation.
AB  == objective: the present study was designed to evaluate the occurrence of periodontal pathogens in the subgingival biofilm of 100 native brazilians living  at the umutina indian reservation, mato grosso state, brazil. methods: periodontal clinical examinations were carried out prior to collection of subgingival biofilm, and the presence of 14 periodontal microorganisms was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the prevalence and risk analysis was performed using cochran and mantel-haenszel statistics for dichotomous variables or pearson's chi-squared test for analysis of proportions when variables had three or more categories. the interrelations between clinical and microbiological parameters were assessed using fisher's exact test and the mann-whitney u test. results: individuals with chronic periodontitis were frequently colonized by the association between porphyromonas gingivalis and campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis and prevotella intermedia, or p. gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. patients with chronic periodontitis were also colonized by porphyromonas gulae and p. intermedia or by the association between p. gulae and t. forsythia. p. gulae was detected only in the subgingival samples from natives on a traditional diet. gingival bleeding was associated with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, t. forsythia, p.  gingivalis, p. gulae, porphyromonas endodontalis, p. intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens. treponema denticola was uncommon. conclusions: peculiar microbiota was demonstrated to be associated with different periodontal disease statuses in  native brazilians, with modest occurrence of certain pathogens, such as t. denticola, and the presence of p. gulae in natives with gingivitis or chronic periodontitis.

TI  == recovery of putative periodontal pathogens from curette sampling at different depths of periodontal lesions: an in vivo cross-sectional clinical study.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the depth of curette sample collection from periodontal lesions on the recovery of putative periodontal pathogens using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). methods: twenty-two periodontal pockets 6 to 8 mm deep with bleeding on probing at a single-rooted tooth were sampled, yielding 66 separate samples. curette samples were obtained at three different levels of the periodontal lesion (orifice, shallow--2 mm into the pocket; or base of lesion), and processed using pcr to identify 10 periodontal pathogens. the chi-square procedure was used to determine whether probe depth affected the distribution of bacterial counts observed. a repeated measures analysis of variance tested the hypotheses related to level of  probe and microorganism on mean rank of bacterial counts. results: the effect of  probe level on mean bacterial counts depends on the type of microorganism. likewise, the effect of microorganism type on mean bacterial counts significantly depends on probe level, where sampling from 2 mm into the periodontal pocket was  found to yield significantly higher results than sampling from the orifice. overall mean counts of pathogenic microorganisms were found to differ significantly across the three probe depths. the microorganisms differed in their observed levels over all three probe levels. further analysis found several significant differences that characterize the nature of the interaction between probe level and microorganism type. conclusion: there is significant difference in the amount of putative periodontal pathogens at varying depths of the pocket when sampled with a periodontal curette.

TI  == microbial leakage at the implant/abutment connection due to implant insertion maneuvers: cross-sectional study 5 years post loading in healthy patients.
AB  == abstract the aim of this study was to test if stress on the prosthetic connection during insertion maneuvers can induce micro-warping at the implant-connection. from sept 2011 to july 20134, patients with implants loaded at least 5 years that were placed with two different insertion implant mounters - mp (conventional) and me (mountless) - were selected from all those that had received dental implant therapy in the past and coming to routine check-up or spontaneous visits during the study period. patients having implants loaded at least 5 years that were placed with two different insertion implant mounters - mp (conventional) and me (mountless) - were recruited. samples were obtained from inside the connection and the abutment surface (cias) using absorbent sterile paper tips. qrt-pcr was performed for total bacterial counts and loads of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythensis (tf), treponema denticola (td), prevotella intermedia (pi), peptostreptococcus micros (pm), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), campylobacter rectus (cr), eikenella corrodens (ec), and candida albicans (ca). the anova test  was used to test for differences. nine patients (20 implants, mp group) and 5 patients (10 implants, me group) were included. regarding the red complex, tf was seen in 80% and 30% of mp and me implants respectively (p<0.001). significant differences were also found in microbial load. for td, proportions were 45% vs. 10% (p=0.022) with no significant differences at load levels. regarding the orange complex, higher prevalence values were found in mp implants, although differences were non-significant. microbial load levels for orange complex bacteria were higher for mp than me, being these differences statistically significant for fn (4.94 vs 3.09; p=0.001). finally, ec was only detected in the  mp group, and ca and aa were not found in either group. within its limitation (small sample size, retrospective analysis, indirect measurement method), the present study suggest that aa mounter not impacting on the prosthetic connection  should be used to reduce microbial contamination of implants.

TI  == distribution of 8 periodontal microorganisms in family members of chinese patients with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == objective: to date, no information on the distribution of periodontal microorganisms among family members of chinese patients with aggressive peridontitis (agp) is available. the aim of the present study was to investigate  the probability of transmission of eight periodontal microorganisms between patients with aggressive periodontitis and their family members. design: saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples were collected from 103 participants from 41 nuclear families (including 41 agp probands, 19 mothers, 22 fathers, 21 siblings). eight periodontal microorganisms, including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema  denticola, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum were detected in these samples by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). in addition, the distribution of fima genotypes was assessed in p. gingivalis-positive individuals by pcr. results: p. gingivalis, t. forsythia,  t. denticola, c. rectus and f. nucleatum were the most frequently detected species both in agp probands and in their relatives. kappa statistical analysis revealed that the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans (kappa = 0.503) and f. nucleatum (kappa = 0.565) in probands was highly consistent with that in their relatives. most probands shared the identical fima genotype of p. gingivalis with their relatives. conclusions: our results suggested that the intrafamilial transmission of periodontal microorganisms may occur between chinese patients with aggressive periodontitis and their relatives.

TI  == oral bacterial dna findings in pericardial fluid.
AB  == background: we recently reported that large amounts of oral bacterial dna can be  found in thrombus aspirates of myocardial infarction patients. some case reports  describe bacterial findings in pericardial fluid, mostly done with conventional culturing and a few with pcr; in purulent pericarditis, nevertheless, bacterial pcr has not been used as a diagnostic method before. objective: to find out whether bacterial dna can be measured in the pericardial fluid and if it correlates with pathologic-anatomic findings linked to cardiovascular diseases. methods: twenty-two pericardial aspirates were collected aseptically prior to forensic autopsy at tampere university hospital during 2009-2010. of the autopsies, 10 (45.5%) were free of coronary artery disease (cad), 7 (31.8%) had mild and 5 (22.7%) had severe cad. bacterial dna amounts were determined using real-time quantitative pcr with specific primers and probes for all bacterial strains associated with endodontic disease (streptococcus mitis group, streptococcus anginosus group, staphylococcus aureus/staphylococcus epidermidis,  prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra) and periodontal disease (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatus, and dialister pneumosintes). results: of 22 cases, 14 (63.6%) were positive for endodontic and 8 (36.4%) for periodontal-disease-associated bacteria. only one case was positive for bacterial culturing. there was a statistically significant association between the relative amount of bacterial dna in the pericardial fluid and the severity of cad (p=0.035). conclusions: oral bacterial dna was detectable in pericardial fluid and an association between the severity of cad and the total amount of bacterial  dna in pericardial fluid was found, suggesting that this kind of measurement might be useful for clinical purposes.

TI  == periodontal and peri-implant microbiota in patients with healthy and inflamed periodontal and peri-implant tissues.
AB  == objective: to compare the prevalence and levels of six bacterial pathogens within the subgingival/submucosal microbiota at teeth versus implants with various clinical conditions. material and methods: twenty-two chinese were included. four subgingival/submucosal sites were selected for microbiological sampling within each subject, that is, (1) healthy peri-implant tissues; (2) peri-implantitis [ppd >/= 5 mm, presence of bleeding on probing (bop) and confirmed radiographic bone loss]; (3) healthy gingiva; and (4) periodontitis (ppd >/=4 mm). subgingival/submucosal plaque was sampled using paper points. quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-pcr) was used to quantify six pathogens, including porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.), treponema denticola (t.d.), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), fusobacterium nucleatum (f.n.), prevotella intermedia (p.i.), and staphylococcus aureus (s.a.). counts were log10-transformed. results: the most commonly detected species were s. a. and f.  n., while a. a. and. p. i. had the lowest detection frequency. the detection frequencies of diseased tooth or implant sites for each of the six target species were either equal to or higher than the respective frequencies at the corresponding healthy sites. there were no statistically significant differences  for any of the species or clinical sites (p > 0.05, cochran's q test). no statistically significant differences in the bacterial loads were found among the four clinical sites; with the exception of f. nucleatum. this was more abundant in periodontitis sites (p = 0.023, friedman's 2-way anova). both periodontal and  peri-implant sites, irrespective of their health status, were revealed to harbor  s. aureus cells. the log10-transformed loads of s. aureus were approximately 3.5  within each of the clinical sites (p = 0.232). this was the highest of the six species analyzed. conclusions: within the same subjects, putative periodontal pathogens were common to both periodontal and peri-implant sites irrespective of  health status. the prevalence and levels of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum were significantly associated with periodontitis, but not with peri-implantitis. a. actinomycetemcomitans was associated with both disease conditions, periodontitis  and peri-implantitis, but not with either gingival or mucosal health.

TI  == prevalence of six periodontal pathogens in subgingival samples of italian patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the subgingival prevalence of six periodontal pathogens in 352 italian patients with chronic periodontitis. possible correlations with clinical parameters, age, gender and smoking status were also investigated. at first visit a pooled subgingival plaque sample was obtained for each subject by using the paper-point method. the samples were processed and analysed according to a commercially available quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction assay (meridol(r) perio diagnostics, gaba international, switzerland). porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), treponema denticola (td), tannerella forsythia (tf), prevotella intermedia (pi), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) were investigated.  fn resulted the most frequently detected (95%) while tf showed the highest load (12x105 cells/plaque sample). aa was the less represented bacteria for load and presence. bacterial load of pg, td, tf and fn showed a direct correlation to bleeding on probing (bop) and presence of suppuration (p=0.0001). the bacterial load was always directly correlated to probing pocket depth (ppd) (p=0.0001). among the investigated variables, ppd resulted the most important risk indicator  for periodontal pathogens. bop appeared as a risk indicator for td, tf, pg detection. few studies have described the microbiological pattern of chronic periodontal disease in the italian population. considering the different forms of periodontitis, similar investigations in other countries are needed to disclose any microbiological differences among populations, which may lead to more specific approaches to prevention and therapy.

TI  == effect of non-surgical periodontal treatment on short chain fatty acid levels in  gingival crevicular fluid of patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: short chain fatty acids (scfas) play important roles in periodontal diseases. however, the concentrations of scfas in gingival crevicular fluid of patients with aggressive periodontitis are not known. the aim of this intervention study was to investigate the influences of non-surgical periodontal  therapy on levels of scfas in the gingival crevicular fluid of patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis (g-agp), and analyze the concentrations of scfas in sites with or without the detected putative periodontal pathogens. material and methods: eighty gingival crevicular fluid samples (four per subject) were collected on filter paper strips from patients with g-agp (n = 20; mean age  24.5 years), before and at 2 wk, 2, 4 and 6 mo after non-surgical periodontal treatment. eighty gingival crevicular fluid samples (four per subject) were collected from periodontally healthy controls (n = 20; mean age 26.2 years). concentrations of formic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid and isovaleric acid from the supernatant of gingival crevicular fluid samples were measured by high performance capillary electrophoresis. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum from the precipitate of the same pretreatment samples of gingival crevicular fluids were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction amplification. results: the clinical parameters of patients with g-agp during the 6 mo after non-surgical periodontal  treatment were improved remarkably. the formic acid concentration increased significantly after treatment; the level of formic acid was lower in the p. gingivalis-, t. denticola-, p. intermedia- or f. nucleatum-positive sites compared with the negative sites. the concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid reduced significantly after treatment and reached the lowest level at 2 wk post-treatment, although showed a tendency to increase after 2 mo post-treatment, and the three scfa levels were significantly higher in p. gingivalis-, t. denticola-, p. intermedia- or f. nucleatum-positive sites compared with those in the negative sites. conclusion: non-surgical periodontal treatment resulted in a significant decrease of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid levels and increase of formic acid level in gingival crevicular fluids in patients with g-agp, accompanied by improvement in clinical parameters. a marked lower level of formic acid, as well as higher levels of acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid in gingival crevicular fluid of patients with g-agp was consistent with periodontal pathogen infection.

TI  == association between polycystic ovary syndrome, oral microbiota and systemic antibody responses.
AB  == polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) is a hormonal disorder of women that not only is the leading cause of infertility but also shows a reciprocal link with oral health. this study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that the levels of putative periodontal pathogens in saliva and their antibody response in serum are elevated in pcos, compared to systemic health. a total of 125 women were included in four groups; 45 women with pcos and healthy periodontium, 35 women with pcos and gingivitis, 25 systemically and periodontally healthy women, 20 systemically  healthy women with gingivitis. salivary levels of seven putative periodontal pathogens were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and serum antibody levels were analyzed by elisa. in women with pcos, salivary porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis and tannerella forsythia levels were higher than matched systemically healthy women,  particularly in the case of gingivitis. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and treponema denticola levels were similar among study groups. the presence of pcos  also enhanced p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and s. oralis serum antibody levels, when gingivitis was also present. gingival inflammation correlated positively with levels of the studied taxa in saliva, particularly in pcos. the presence of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum in saliva also exhibited a strong positive correlation with the corresponding serum antibody levels. in conclusion, as an underlying systemic endocrine condition, pcos may quantitatively affect the composition of oral microbiota and the raised systemic response to selective members of this microbial community, exerting a confounding role in resultant gingival inflammation and periodontal health. the most consistent effect appeared to be exerted on p. gingivalis.

TI  == the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity of one-year-old infants delivered pre-term with very low birthweights: a case control study.
AB  == background: recently, the dental literature has focused mainly on the microbial colonization of healthy full-term infants and their mothers or caretakers. however, oral microbial acquisition by premature infants has not been adequately  investigated, and the correlation between pre-term birth and the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens has not been determined. the aim of this study was to identify the presence and quantities of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavities of 12-month-old infants and compare the occurrence of these microbes between a cohort of pre-term infants with very low birthweights and a control cohort comprising full-term infants. methods: the research cohort was composed of 69 one-year-old infants, of whom 24  were born prematurely with very low birthweights and 45 of whom were carried to full term. information regarding the infants' gestational age, mode of delivery,  general health status, birthweight and antibiotic use were obtained from hospital records and through oral interviews. at 12 months of age, both groups of infants  were examined, and unstimulated saliva samples from the dorsum of the tongue and  dental plaque samples were collected. the microorganisms (streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp., actinomyces spp., aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum) were identified and their quantities were evaluated using a pcr-based method. the chi-squared and fisher's factorial tests were used for the statistical evaluations. results: the infants had a high prevalence of cariogenic microbes and of fusosbacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. cariogenic microbes were detected in 91.7% of the very low birthweight infants and in all full-term infants. periodontal pathogens were present in 83% of the pre-term infants and in 96% of the full-term infants. a significant difference was found between the cohorts in terms of the presence of s. mutans. most of the  very low birthweight infants had negative values of this microbe, while the full-term infants had positive values. conclusions: this study confirms the early transmission of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens to the oral cavity of one-year-old infants and a higher prevalence of s. mutans in full-term  infants than in premature infants.

TI  == microbial signature profiles of periodontally healthy and diseased patients.
AB  == aim: to determine microbial profiles that discriminate periodontal health from different forms of periodontal diseases. methods: subgingival biofilm was obtained from patients with periodontal health (27), gingivitis (11), chronic periodontitis (35) and aggressive periodontitis (24), and analysed for the presence of >250 species/phylotypes using homim. microbial differences among groups were examined by mann-whitney u-test. regression analyses were performed to determine microbial risk indicators of disease. results: putative and potential new periodontal pathogens were more prevalent in subjects with periodontal diseases than periodontal health. detection of porphyromonas endodontalis/porphyromonas spp. (or 9.5 [1.2-73.1]) and tannerella forsythia (or  38.2 [3.2-450.6]), and absence of neisseria polysaccharea (or 0.004 [0-0.15]) and prevotella denticola (or 0.014 [0-0.49], p < 0.05) were risk indicators of periodontal disease. presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (or 29.4 [3.4-176.5]), cardiobacterium hominis (or 14.9 [2.3-98.7]), peptostreptococcaceae sp. (or 35.9 [2.7-483.9]), p. alactolyticus (or 31.3 [2.1-477.2]), and absence of fretibacterium spp. (or 0.024 [0.002-0.357]), fusobacterium naviforme/fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii (or 0.015 [0.001-0.223]), granulicatella adiacens/granulicatella elegans (or 0.013 [0.001-0.233], p < 0.05) were associated with aggressive periodontitis. conclusion: there were specific microbial signatures of the subgingival biofilm that were able to distinguish between microbiomes of periodontal health and diseases. such profiles may be used to establish risk of disease.

TI  == periodontopathogens and human beta-defensin-2 expression in gingival crevicular fluid from patients with periodontal disease in guangxi, china.
AB  == background and objective: periodontal diseases are often induced by periodontopathogens, which are always exposed to certain innate immune factors in gingival crevicular fluid, including human beta-defensin-2 (hbd-2). this study aims to investigate the relationship among periodontopathogens, clinical parameters and hbd-2 expression. material and methods: thirty-two healthy controls, 42 patients with chronic gingivitis and 95 patients with chronic periodontitis were recruited in guangxi, china. bleeding index, probing depth and clinical attachment level were measured for all teeth including mesiobuccal, buccal, disobuccal, mesiolingual, lingual, disolingual six sites of all patient.  gingival crevicular fluid samples were collected from the study sites. the prevalence and copy numbers (cn) of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, tannerella  forsythia and total bacteria in gingival crevicular fluid were quantified by real-time pcr. the hbd-2 concentration in gingival crevicular fluid was measured  by elisa. results: both the prevalence and the cn of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, t. denticola and t. forsythia were higher in patients with chronic periodontitis than in healthy controls and patients with chronic gingivitis; however, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of p. intermedia among the three study groups, and the highest cn was found in patients with chronic gingivitis, rather than in patients with chronic periodontitis. the loads of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. denticola and total bacteria were positively  related to probing depth, bleeding index and clinical attachment level. the concentration of hbd-2 in gingival crevicular fluid was higher in patients with chronic gingivitis and in patients with chronic periodontitis than in healthy controls. in addition, the hbd-2 concentration was positively related to the cn of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and total bacteria, as well as to bleeding index and probing depth. conclusion: the prevalence, composition and cn of periodontopathogens were closely related to the severity of periodontal disease,  and the red complex was related to the severity of clinical symptoms of periodontal diseases. the concentration of hbd-2 in gingival crevicular fluid from periodontal disease sites was higher than that in gingival crevicular fluid  from healthy sites, which suggests that hbd-2 expression might be up-regulated by periodontopathogens.

TI  == rare case of generalised aggressive periodontitis in the primary dentition.
AB  == background: generalised aggressive periodontitis (ap) in the prepubescent age is  an exceptionally rare disease in the primary dentition of otherwise healthy children. characteristics of ap are gingival inflammation, deep periodontal pockets, bone loss, tooth mobility and even tooth loss. the most common way of treating this disease is the extraction of all the involved primary teeth. case report: a 4-year-old girl presented with signs of severe gingival inflammation. clinical examination revealed deep pockets, increased tooth mobility and bone loss. microbiological testing revealed the presence of a typical periopathogenic  flora consisting of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and the typical members of the red complex (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola). the patient underwent tooth extraction of all primary teeth except the primary canines, followed by thorough root debridement and treatment with systemic antibiotics (amoxicillin plus metronidazole). follow-up: regular clinical and microbiological examinations over 4 years showed no signs of recurrence of a periodontitis, even in the erupted permanent teeth. conclusion: early diagnosis and consequent early treatment of aggressive periodontitis can stop the disease and therefore avoid the development of a periodontal disease in  the permanent dentition. a close collaboration between specialists of different disciplines is required for a favourable outcome.

TI  == internal bacterial colonization of implants: association with peri-implant bone loss.
AB  == objectives: the aim of the present longitudinal study was to investigate bacterial colonization of the internal implant cavity and to evaluate a possible  association with peri-implant bone loss. methods: a total of 264 paper point samples were harvested from the intra-implant cavity of 66 implants in 26 patients immediately following implant insertion and after 3, 4, and 12 months. samples were evaluated for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola,  and tannerella forsythia as well as total bacterial counts by real-time pcr. bone loss was evaluated on standardized radiographs up to 25 months after implant insertion. for the statistical analysis of the data, mixed effects models were fitted. results: there was an increase in the frequency of detection as well as in the mean counts of the selected bacteria over time. the evaluation of the target bacteria revealed a significant association of pr. intermedia at 4 and 12  months with peri-implant bone loss at 25 months (4 months: p = 0.009; 12 months:  p = 0.021). conclusions: the present study could demonstrate a progressive colonization by periodontopathogenic bacteria in the internal cavities of two-piece implants. the results suggest that internal colonization with pr. intermedia was associated with peri-implant bone loss.

TI  == assessment of periodontal and opportunistic flora in patients with peri-implantitis.
AB  == aim: to assess the presence of periodontal and opportunistic organisms in patients with peri-implantitis. material and methods: thirty-three partially edentulous subjects (22 women, 11 men), aged 32-90 years, who had one or more implants with peri-implantitis were included. peri-implantitis was defined as: (i) the presence of bleeding on probing and/or suppuration and (ii) radiographic  images showed marginal bone loss >1.8 mm after 1 year in function. criteria for inclusion were: (i) partially edentulous patients having at least one implant diagnosed with peri-implantitis; (ii) no antibiotic therapy for 6 months prior to clinical examination. following this definition, a total of 48 implants were diagnosed with peri-implantitis. subgingival bacterial samples were obtained with sterile paper points from infected implants and selected teeth of each individual. periodontopathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) were detected by multiplex pcr targeting 16s rdna. samples were placed in reduced transport medium and cultured for opportunistic pathogens  (staphylococcus aureus, enteric bacteria, pseudomonas and yeasts). results: twenty-two patients yielded positive results for p. gingivalis, 25 for t. forsythia, eight for p. intermedia and 13 for t. denticola. none of the patients  yielded a positive result for a. actinomycetemcomitans. non-periodontal species were found in five patients (15% of total). p. aeruginosa was found in four (12%) patients, and c. albicans (3%) and s. aureus in one patient (3%) each. in two cases of peri-implantitis, none of the periodontal or opportunistic microorganisms studied were detected in either implant or tooth samples. when results of the periodontopathic bacteria from the implant and tooth samples of the same patient were compared, 18 patients (54%) showed the same results for both samples and 15 (45%) patients different results. conclusions: the implant surface may be colonized with pathogens different from periodontal bacteria. opportunistic pathogens such as p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and c. albicans may be associated with implant failure.

TI  == microbiological assessment of the implant-abutment interface in different connections: cross-sectional study after 5 years of functional loading.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the bacterial microflora present inside the implant connection and in the peri-implant sulcus fluid of healthy implants, and to analyze the relationships between these harboring sites for four different implant systems after at least 5 years of functional loading. materials and methods: a cross-sectional study was performed involving 40 patients treated with metal-ceramic cemented bridges supported by at least two healthy implants functionally loaded for 5 years. four different implant-abutment connections were studied: external hexagon (control group), double internal hexagon (test group 1), internal hexagon with external collar (test group 2), and conical connection  (test group 3). samples for microbiological analysis were obtained from three types of sites: peri-implant sulci, connections' inside and abutments surface and, as control, gingival sulci of neighboring teeth. quantitative real-time pcr  was carried out for total bacterial count and for 10 microorganisms: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, and candida albicans. the response variables were percentage of positive sites and absolute bacterial load. the relations of the response variables with the type of connection and of sampling site were assessed using generalized estimating equations. results: regarding the analysis of positivity to bacteria in the peri-implant sulcus no significant differences were observed. analyzing the connection's inside, none of the connection designs had the capacity to prevent microbiological leakage through the implant/abutment microgap. test group 3 presented the lowest mean values for red complex bacteria and control group the highest, although differences were non-significant. statistical significance was  only reached for treponema denticola in the bacterial load analysis inside the connection. test groups 1 and 2 yielded lower values for orange complex bacteria  but only for peptostreptococos micros the differences resulted significant. test  groups 2 and 3 had significantly lower total bacterial counts in the peri-implant sulcus and inside the connection. conclusions: outcomes suggested that all the analyzed connections resulted contaminated after 5 years of functional loading. however, the connection design might influence bacterial activity levels qualitatively and quantitatively, especially inside the implant connection.

TI  == subgingival periodontal pathogens associated with chronic periodontitis in yemenis.
AB  == background: subgingival microbial profile associated with periodontitis has been  reported to significantly differ by geographical location. the purpose of this study was to assess the association between a panel of putative periodontal bacterial pathogens and chronic periodontitis among yemenis. methods: subgingival dna samples were obtained from diseased and healthy sites of 20 non-smoking, moderate to severe chronic periodontitis subjects. absolute counts (bacterial dna copies per sample) and relative counts (% total bacteria) of seven periopathogenic species/genera representative of the red and orange complexes were determined using taqman q-pcr assays. results: the q-pcr assays showed excellent linearity (r2 > 0.99) and a sensitivity of 100 copies/sample. the detection rate was 100% for all tested species/genera except for p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans that were detected at 97.5% and 67.5%, respectively. the median log absolute counts were in the range of 2.41-6.53 copies per sample while median relative counts were in the range of 0.001-0.77%, both being highest for fusobacteria and lowest for a. actinomycetemcomitans. significant interspecies correlations were observed. adjusting for multiple comparisons (p</=0.0063), only t. forsythia, t. denticola and p. micra maintained significant association with periodontal destruction. the latter species, however, showed the strongest association and was found in higher proportions at the periodontitis sites across all subjects (3.39 median fold increase). no significant differences were observed for p. gingivalis. conclusions: p. micra rather than p. gingivalis  appears as a keystone pathogen in this yemeni sample. however, these findings need to be validated in a larger-scale study before they can be claimed to represent ethnic variations in pathogens' association with periodontitis.

TI  == periodontal bacteria in the genital tract: are they related to adverse pregnancy  outcome?
AB  == one of the most important factors implicated in preterm birth (ptb) is acute genitourinary tract infection. the bacteria causing chronic periodontal inflammation include gram-negative rods and anaerobes similar to those found in women with bacterial vaginosis. the aim of this prospective study is to investigate the relationship between oral and vaginal microflora and preterm low  birth weight. real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect both the presence and level of six periodontitis-related species: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythia (tf), treponema denticola (td), fusobacterium nucleatum ssp(fn), and prevotella intermedia (pi) for both oral samples of subgingival plaque and cervical samples, obtained from 80 patients, during gynaecological examinations. the more representative oral pathogen (less than 60 percent) species in oral samples of preterm and term group were tf, td, and fn. 24.4 percent of pregnant women presented periodontal pathogens in vaginal swab; the most representative species  with a percentage over 0.1 percent of total bacteria in genital tract of preterm  group were tf, td, and piwith a positive correlation (less than 0.5). the presence of the bacterium t. denticolain the vagina, regardless of the amount, adversely affects preterm delivery.

TI  == the effects of different orthodontic appliances upon microbial communities.
AB  == objectives: orthodontic appliances can promote accumulation of dental plaque, with associated enamel decalcification or gingival inflammation. the aim of this  study was to examine longer-term microbiological changes during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. materials and methods: twenty-four orthodontic patients aged 11-14 years undergoing fixed appliance therapy were recruited into  the study. each was randomized for cross-mouth assignment of molar bands and bonded molar tubes to contralateral quadrants of the mouth. all patients received self-ligating brackets, but again using randomization, one upper lateral incisor  bracket (left or right) also received an elastomeric ligature. plaque samples from the molars and upper lateral incisors were obtained at intervals during treatment and up to 1 year after appliance removal. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16s rdna microarray were used to compare plaque microbial fingerprints. results: plaque populations changed within 3 months of commencing treatment at all sites. the greatest differences in plaque composition were seen  with self-ligating brackets with an elastomeric ligature. post-treatment plaque associated with both types of molar attachment contained increased levels of periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and eubacterium nodatum, while campylobacter rectus, parvimonas micra, and actinomyces odontolyticus were also elevated with bonds. conclusions: the results suggest that orthodontic treatment may cause sustained changes in plaque microbiotas and that molar bond-associated plaque may have raised disease potential.

TI  == smoking-related cotinine levels and host responses in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: smoking has been reported to increase the risk of periodontal disease by disrupting the balance of immune responses and tissue repair processes; however, this risk varies among smokers. cotinine levels in saliva are routinely used to measure the level of smoking, and reflect the quantity of nicotine, and other smoking-related xenobiotics that challenge host systems. this study delineated characteristics of inflammatory mediators in saliva and serum antibody responses to both periodontal pathogens and commensal bacteria in smokers as they related to cotinine levels. materials and methods: this case-control study (n = 279) examined salivary inflammatory mediator responses [interleukin (il)-1ss, il-10, prostaglandin e2, myeloperoxidase and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1], and serum igg antibody responses to three periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomyce-temcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola) and five commensal oral microorganisms (veillonella parvula, streptococcus sanguis, prevotella loescheii, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga ochracea). results: the patients were stratified into  health (n = 30), gingivitis (n = 55) and periodontitis (n = 184); cotinine levels correlated with reported smoking habits in health, less so with gingivitis, and were not correlated in periodontitis. of the inflammatory mediators/acute phase proteins, only il-1ss levels were positively associated (p < 0.001) with the pack years and cotinine levels. as might be predicted, patients with periodontitis smoked more (p < 0.001) and had higher levels of cotinine. il-1ss and antibody to a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and t. denticola were significantly higher in the patients with periodontitis than either patients with gingivitis or who were healthy. conclusions: generally, antibody to the pathogens and commensals was lower with decreased cotinine levels. smoking exacerbated differences in both inflammatory mediators and three antibody in periodontal disease compared to healthy subjects.

TI  == microbial analysis of subgingival plaque samples compared to that of whole saliva in patients with periodontitis.
AB  == background: the detection of special bacterial species in patients with periodontitis is considered to be useful for clinical diagnosis and treatment. the collection of subgingival plaque samples is the common way for the determination of periodontopathic bacteria. however, recently, salivary analysis  has been discussed as an advantageous future diagnostic method for periodontitis  because it offers simple quantitative sampling and the possibility to assess various bacteria. the aim of this cross-sectional study is to investigate whether there is a correlation between the results of different bacterial species in saliva and subgingival plaque samples from individuals with aggressive periodontitis (agp) and chronic periodontitis (cp). methods: whole saliva and subgingival plaque samples from the deepest pocket of each quadrant were collected from 43 patients with cp and 33 patients with agp. twenty different bacterial species from both samplings were determined by the 16s ribosomal rna-based polymerase chain reaction with microarray technique. results: all bacterial species were detected in salivary and subgingival plaque samples. for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, as well as actinomyces viscosus, campylobacter rectus/showae, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra, eubacterium nodatum, and campylobacter gracilis, a significant positive correlation between salivary and subgingival plaque samples was detected in patients with both types  of periodontitis. there were no significant differences in bacteria in salivary and subgingival plaque samples between agp and cp. conclusion: salivary analysis  might be discussed as a potential alternative to subgingival plaque sampling for  microbiologic analysis in both agp and cp.

TI  == quantitative analysis of periodontal pathogens present in the saliva of geriatric subjects.
AB  == purpose: at present, information regarding periodontal disease in geriatric patients is scarce. the purpose of this study was to quantify the periodontal pathogens present in the saliva of korean geriatric patients and assess the relationship between the bacterial levels and the periodontal condition. methods: six putative periodontal pathogens were quantified by using a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay in geriatric patient groups (>60 years) with mild chronic periodontitis (mcp), moderate chronic periodontitis (mocp), and severe chronic periodontitis (scp). the copy numbers of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia were measured. results: it was found that the bacterial copy numbers increased as the severity of the disease increased from mcp to scp, except for p. intermedia. for p. intermedia, it was found that samples in the mcp group yielded the largest amount. it was also found that the quantities of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola, the so-called "red complex" bacteria, were lower than those of f. nucleatum, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. intermedia in all of the samples. conclusions: collectively, the results of this study suggest that the levels of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, f. nucleatum, and t. denticola present in saliva are associated with the severity of periodontal disease in geriatric patients.

TI  == clinical evaluation of salivary periodontal pathogen levels by real-time polymerase chain reaction in patients before dental implant treatment.
AB  == objective: periodontal pathogens in dental plaque are the main causative agents of periodontitis and peri-implantitis. detection of the presence of such periodontal pathogens early would serve as a useful tool in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether the periodontal pathogen levels in saliva were correlated with the periodontal status of patients receiving implant treatment. materials and methods: a total of 291 patients visiting tokyo dental college chiba hospital were divided into four groups: a no-periodontitis (np) group, a mild-periodontitis (mip) group, a moderate-periodontitis (mop) group, and a severe-periodontitis (sp) group. the levels of the following five periodontal pathogens in saliva were evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction: porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia. results: the levels of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were significantly higher in mop group than in np  group (p < 0.05). the levels of all periodontal pathogens tested except a. actinomycetemcomitans were significantly higher in sp group than in np group (p < 0.05). conclusion: the detection levels of the periodontal pathogens targeted in  saliva samples were correlated with the periodontal status. this suggests that using saliva to screen for periodontopathic bacteria offers an easier-to-use clinical tool than the paper point method in the diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis and peri-implantitis.

TI  == periodontopathogen profile of healthy and oral lichen planus patients with gingivitis or periodontitis.
AB  == oral lichen planus (olp) is a chronic inflammatory disease that is frequently detected in oral tissues. the aim of our study was to identify the prevalence of  the detection of periodontopathogenic microorganisms (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola in olp patients and to compare with  this prevalence of periodontopathogenic microorganisms in healthy non-olp patients. our study included 27 (18 chronic periodontitis (olpp) and 9 gingivitis (olpg)) patients diagnosed with olp along with 26 (13 chronic periodontitis (hp)  and 13 gingivitis (hg)) healthy non-olp patients. the multiplex polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) with subsequent reverse hybridization method (micro-ident) was used for identifying periodontopathogenic microorganisms present in subgingival plaque samples. the percentages of detection for a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia and t. denticola in subgingival plaque samples taken from olp patients (olpg and olpp) were 18.5%, 85.1%, 81.4%, 88.8% and 74%, respectively. meanwhile, in the non-olp patients (hg and hp), these values were 7.6%, 50%, 46.1%, 73% and 57.7%, respectively. thus, comparing the non-olp groups with the olp groups, the periodontopathogens' percentages of detection in the olp groups were higher than those in the non-olp groups. according to our study results, olp patients have higher levels of infection with a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia and t. denticola than non-olp patients. we argue that the high percentages in patients with olp may help identify the importance of periodontopathogenic microorganisms  in the progress of periodontal diseases of olp.

TI  == periodontopathogen and epstein-barr virus-associated periapical periodontitis may be the source of retrograde infectious peri-implantitis.
AB  == background: herpesviral-bacterial synergism may play a role in periodontitis and  peri-implantitis etiopathogenesis. periapical periodontitis (pp) lesions can predict future apical peri-implantitis complications. purpose: this pilot study aimed to substantiate herpesviral-bacterial coinfection in symptomatic (sp) and asymptomatic (ap) pp and assess associations with periodontopathogen salivary contamination in patients receiving implants. materials and methods: polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based identification was performed on pp granulation tissue  (gt) from 33 sp and ap patients and compared with unstimulated whole saliva. quantitative pcr evaluated epstein-barr virus (ebv) and cytomegalovirus copy counts. results: sp gt had higher proportions of periodontopathogens. symptomatic patients were 3.7 times more likely to be infected with ebv than ap (p = .07; 95% ci: 0.8-16.2). sp were 2.9, 2.1, 3.6, and 1.6 times more likely to be infected with treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and porphyromonas gingivalis, respectively. the odds ratio of ebv infecting pp lesions was two times higher in those positive for the virus  in saliva. saliva tannerella forsythia-positive patients were 15 times more likely to present this pathogen in pp lesions (p = .038). saliva ebv-positive individuals were 7 and 3.5 times more likely to yield gt contamination with t. forsythia and t. denticola, respectively. ebv copy counts were significantly higher in sp (p < .01). conclusions: a causal association between ebv, specific bacterial anaerobic infection, and symptomatic pp is likely. ebv high prevalence  underscores the viral etiological importance. salivary ebv contamination is likely to be associated with viral and bacterial gt infection. saliva pcr analysis can be a good predictor of gt specific infection and help establish antimicrobial therapy. if confirmed by prospective longitudinal clinical trials,  antiviral therapy could possibly benefit sp and nonresponsive to treatment individuals and help prevent potential peri-implant infectious complications.

AB  == objectives: as periodontal bacteria might be involved in the aetiology of rheumatic diseases, we analysed synovial fluid obtained from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and controls for the presence of dna of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. methods: in all, 42 patients suffering from ra (mean age 53.8 +/- 16.7 years, 40.4% females) and 114 controls  with no rheumatic diseases (mean age 56.1 +/- 15.2 years, 52.4% females) were included. dna from synovial fluid was isolated by qiaamp kit (qiagen, hilden, germany). polymerase chain reactions (pcrs) specific for the 16s rrna genes of the above specified bacteria were developed. subgingival bacterial colonization was analysed using micro-ident((r)) test (hain-diagnostik, nehren, germany). results: in patients with ra dna of p. gingivalis was detected in synovial fluid  more often than in controls (15.7% versus 3.5%, p = 0.045). more patients than controls harboured dna from p. gingivalis in both, oral plaque and synovial fluid (11.9% versus. 0.9%, p = 0.030). among the patients group the number of missing teeth was correlated with the number of joints with movement restrictions caused  by ra. conclusions: dna of periodontopathogens can be found in synovial fluid and oral bacteria may play a role in the pathogenesis of arthritis.

TI  == prevalence of periodontal pathogens and metabolic control of type 1 diabetes patients.
AB  == objective: the aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of periodontal pathogens aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola in subgingival plaque collected at different probing depths of type 1 diabetes patients with periodontal disease in correlation to metabolic control. methods: twenty-one patients 40 to 50 years old were included in the study. in each patient blood samples were taken for the evaluation of hba1c level and subgingival plaque samples were taken with paper points from the two deepest pockets. the presence of five periodontal pathogens was detected by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. results: the results of 38 plaque samples showed that  t. forsythia was found in 48% followed by t. denticola in 31%, p. gingivalis in 26%, p. intermedia in 9% and a. actinomycetemcomitans in 7%. t. forsythia and t.  denticola were the most frequent combination of periodontal pathogens found in the same sample. the serum level of hba1c in nine patients where t. forsythia was detected (7.5 +/- 1.4%) was significantly higher (f-test, p = 0.001) than in 12 patients where t. forsythia was not detected (6.8 +/- 0.5%). similarly, the serum level of hba1c was significantly higher (f-test, p = 0.001) in eight patients where t. denticola was detected (7.5 +/- 1.8%) compared to the 13 patients where  t. denticola was not detected (7.0 +/- 0.5%). no such correlation was found for p. gingivalis, p. intermedia or a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusions: we conclude that t. forsythia and t. denticola are most frequently found in subgingival plaque samples of type 1 diabetic patients and these findings correlate with poorer metabolic control of diabetes.

TI  == clinical and microbiologic effects of lingual cervical coverage by removable partial dentures.
AB  == purpose: the effect of gingival coverage by removable partial dentures (rpds) on  bacterial accumulation has not been sufficiently established. the aim of this study was to evaluate the periodontal and microbiologic reactions to mandibular major connectors. it was hypothesized that the use of a lingual plate increases the risk of periodontal disease. materials and methods: fourteen subjects (mean age: 69.0 years) received oral hygiene instructions and ultrasonic debridement prior to examination. each subject received an experimental rpd incorporating either a lingual bar or lingual plate for the first 8 weeks and was then switched to the other option for the next 8 weeks. clinical parameters (plaque index, gingival index, probing depth, and tooth mobility) were recorded. subgingival plaque samples were collected from the periodontal pocket in the test site to measure the colonization of periodontal pathogens after the use of each denture.  results: the mean probing depth was significantly greater after use of the lingual plate compared to the lingual bar (p < .05), whereas the type of connector did not affect the levels of any of the microbial species. all subjects that exhibited at least one bacterial species showed smaller numbers of microorganisms at the second examination than at the first. conclusions: the lingual cervical coverage did not precipitate the accumulation of anaerobic microorganisms, although it could potentially induce gingival inflammation. the results suggest that a lingual plate can be used as safely as a lingual bar if oral and denture hygiene are carefully monitored.

TI  == optimization of quantitative polymerase chain reactions for detection and quantification of eight periodontal bacterial pathogens.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to optimize quantitative (real-time) polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) assays for 8 major periodontal pathogens, i.e. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tanerella forsythia and  treponema denticola, and of the caries pathogen streptococcus mutans. results: eighteen different primer pairs were analyzed in silico regarding specificity (using blast analysis) and the presence of secondary structures at primer binding sites (using mfold). the most specific and efficiently binding primer pairs, according to these analyses, were selected for qpcr-analysis to determine amplification efficiency, limit of quantification and intra-run reproducibility.  for the selected primer pairs, one for each species, the specificity was confirmed by assessing amplification of dna extracts from isolates of closely related species. for these primer pairs, the intercycler portability was evaluated on 3 different thermal cyclers (the applied biosystems 7300, the bio-rad iq5 and the roche light cycler 480). for all assays on the different cyclers, a good correlation of the standard series was obtained (i.e. r2 >/= 0.98), but quantification limits varied among cyclers. the overall best quantification limit was obtained by using a 2 mul sample in a final volume of 10 mul on the light cycler 480. conclusions: in conclusion, the proposed assays allow to quantify the bacterial loads of s. mutans, 6 periodontal pathogenic species and the genus fusobacterium.this can be of use in assessing periodontal risk, determination of the optimal periodontal therapy and evaluation of this treatment.

TI  == influence of periodontal status and periodontopathogens on levels of oral human beta-defensin-2 in saliva.
AB  == background: expression patterns of human beta-defensin-2 (hbd-2) mrna or hbd-2 protein concentration and periodontal diseases have been a focus of scientific research. this study compares the salivary levels of hbd-2 protein concentration  of healthy patients and patients with gingivitis and chronic periodontitis (cp) and correlates these levels with the presence of periodontopathogens. methods: a  total of 89 patients were enrolled in this study: 31 periodontally healthy, 27 with gingivitis, and 31 with cp. plaque and gingival indices, probing depth, and  clinical attachment level were measured. the presence of campylobacter rectus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia was evaluated qualitatively by conventional polymerase chain reaction. hbd-2 quantification in  saliva was performed using an immune enzymatic assay. frequency of periodontopathogens and hbd-2 protein concentration was assessed. association between hbd-2 protein concentration (>/=100 pg/ml) and the simultaneous presence  of one to two, three to four, or five to six periodontopathogens was tested. results: although periodontally healthy individuals and patients with gingivitis  showed similar hbd-2 levels, the cp group displayed an increased level of hbd-2.  p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia, and t. denticola were more prevalent  in cp; however, their mere presence was not related to the increased levels of hbd-2 (pearson correlation and multinomial logistic regression model). conclusions: salivary hbd-2 protein concentration was higher in patients with cp  compared with healthy individuals or patients with gingivitis. these different protein concentrations were not related to the frequency of periodontopathogens.  clinical inflammatory profile had a higher impact on salivary hbd-2 levels than bacteria.

TI  == frequency of periodontal pathogens in equivalent peri-implant and periodontal clinical statuses.
AB  == objectives: this study tested the hypotheses that there is: (1) higher bacterial  frequency in peri-implantitis/periodontitis, followed by mucositis/gingivitis and peri-implant/periodontal health; (2) similar bacterial frequency between comparable peri-implant and periodontal clinical statuses. design of study: the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was evaluated in peri-implant (n=53) and periodontal (n=53) health; mucositis (n=50), gingivitis (n=50), peri-implantitis (n=50) and periodontitis (n=50). results: the pattern of peri-implant bacterial frequency was not as expected (peri-implantitis>mucositis>health). except for p. intermedia (p>0.05), bacterial frequency was higher in peri-implantitis than health (p<0.05). the frequency of p.gingivalis and red complex species were higher in peri-implantitis than mucositis (p<0.05). in periodontal samples, t. forsythia and t. denticola showed the expected pattern of frequency (periodontitis>gingivitis>health). the frequencies of c. rectus and t. forsythia  were higher in healthy teeth/gingivitis than healthy implants/mucositis, respectively (p<0.05). the frequency of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans were similar between periodontitis and peri-implantitis (p>0.05) while all other species occurrences were higher in periodontitis than peri-implantitis (p<0.05). conclusions: bacterial frequency increased from peri-implant/periodontal health to peri-implantitis/periodontitis but not from mucositis/gingivitis to peri-implantitis/periodontitis. there was a trend towards higher bacterial frequency in teeth than implants.

TI  == possible translocation of periodontal pathogens into the lymph nodes draining the oral cavity.
AB  == numerous publications have reported the presence of periodontopathogenic bacteria in peripheral and central vascular lesions. however, it is unclear how this bacterial translocation occurs. the objective of this study was to investigate whether periodontopathic bacteria are translocated to lymph nodes proximal to the oral cavity. obtaining lymph node samples is not ethically feasible unless they are excised as part of the surgical management of patients with cancer. this study analyzed formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded lymph nodes, histologically negative for cancer cell invasion, that were excised from 66 patients with histories of head and neck cancer. real-time pcr was performed to amplify the 16s ribosomal dna fragments from porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia. the relationship between bacterial detection and cancer severity, gender, and the use of anti-cancer therapy was examined by fisher's exact test. p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and p. intermedia were present in 17%, 8%, and 8% of the samples of submandibular and submental lymph nodes, respectively. there were  no significant relationships between bacterial detection and the cancer disease status, patient gender or use of anticancer therapy. according to these data, it  appears that the translocation of periodontopathic bacteria may occur via lymphatic drainage, irrespective of the cancer disease status, gender or anticancer therapy.

TI  == cleavage of igg1 in gingival crevicular fluid is associated with the presence of  porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == background and objectives: immunoglobulin (ig) g1 plays an important role in the  adaptive immune response. kgp, a lysine-specific cysteine protease from porphyromonas gingivalis, specifically hydrolyses igg1 heavy chains. the purpose  of this study was to examine whether cleavage of igg1 occurs in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) in vivo, and whether there is any association with the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontopathogens. material and  methods: gcf was obtained from nine patients with aggressive periodontitis, nine  with chronic periodontitis and five periodontally healthy individuals. the bacterial loads of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia and tannerella  forsythia were analysed by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the presence  and cleavage of igg1 and igg2 were determined using western blotting. kgp levels  were measured by elisa. results: cleaved igg1 was identified in the gcf from 67%  of patients with aggressive periodontitis and in 44% of patients with chronic periodontitis. by contrast, no cleaved igg1 was detectable in healthy controls. no degradation of igg2 was detected in any of the samples, regardless of health status. porphyromonas gingivalis was found in high numbers in all samples in which cleavage of igg1 was detected (p < 0.001 compared with samples with no igg  cleavage). furthermore, high numbers of tannerella forsythia and prevotella intermedia were also present in these samples. the level of kgp in the gcf correlated with the load of porphyromonas gingivalis (r = 0.425, p < 0.01). the presence of kgp (range 0.07-10.98 ng/ml) was associated with proteolytic fragments of igg1 (p < 0.001). however, cleaved igg1 was also detected in samples with no detectable kgp. conclusion: in patients with periodontitis, cleavage of igg1 occurs in vivo and may suppress antibody-dependent antibacterial activity in subgingival biofilms especially those colonized by porphyromonas gingivalis.

TI  == quantification of periodontopathic bacteria in saliva using the invader assay.
AB  == when quantifying periodontopathic bacteria, it is important to use a convenient method that does not produce false negative results. the invader assay is a convenient method because it does not involve gene amplification. the purpose of  this study was to evaluate the validity of the invader assay to quantify periodontopathic bacteria. the invader technology was applied in quantifying five periodontopathic bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola). the invader assay produced a linear quantitative detection range over concentrations spanning seven exponential values, with a detection limit of 10(3.7) copies/tube and intra-day and inter-day variance of 0.1% to 4.7% and 0.1% to 3.4%, respectively, in quantifying five periodontopathic bacteria. we compared the results of the invader assay with those of real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) performed for quantifying five periodontopathic bacteria in 22 patients with periodontitis. among the invader-detectable bacterial strains of each species, significant correlations were observed in the counts of concerned bacterial species between these two methods, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.757 to 0.996. this study validated repeatability and reproducibility of the invader assay in quantifying periodontopathic bacteria and demonstrated consistent agreement between the invader assay and real-time pcr in  quantifying periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == genome-wide association study of periodontal pathogen colonization.
AB  == pathological shifts of the human microbiome are characteristic of many diseases,  including chronic periodontitis. to date, there is limited evidence on host genetic risk loci associated with periodontal pathogen colonization. we conducted a genome-wide association (gwa) study among 1,020 white participants of the atherosclerosis risk in communities study, whose periodontal diagnosis ranged from healthy to severe chronic periodontitis, and for whom "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization quantification of 8 periodontal pathogens was performed. we examined 3 traits: "high red" and "high orange" bacterial complexes, and "high" aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) colonization. genotyping was performed on the affymetrix 6.0 platform. imputation to 2.5 million markers was based on hapmap ii-ceu, and a multiple-test correction was applied (genome-wide threshold  of p < 5 x 10(-8)). we detected no genome-wide significant signals. however, 13 loci, including kcnk1, fbxo38, uhrf2, il33, runx2, trps1, camta1, and vamp3, provided suggestive evidence (p < 5 x 10(-6)) of association. all associations reported for "red" and "orange" complex microbiota, but not for aa, had the same  effect direction in a second sample of 123 african-american participants. none of these polymorphisms was associated with periodontitis diagnosis. investigations replicating these findings may lead to an improved understanding of the complex nature of host-microbiome interactions that characterizes states of health and disease.

TI  == do elderly edentulous patients with a history of periodontitis harbor periodontal pathogens?
AB  == objectives: the presence of periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity may impact implant survival. therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, eikenella corrodens, and parvimonas micra in a specific elderly population with a history of periodontitis who have never worn dentures. material and methods: thirty dentate subjects (mean age 61.7 +/- 7.05 years) and 30 edentulous subjects (mean age 65.8 +/- 8.05 years) were included in this cross-sectional study. microbiological samples of cheek mucosa and the dorsum of  the tongue were taken from all subjects. in addition, sulcus samples were taken from the dentate group. all samples were analysed using a bacterial dna-specific  polymerase chain reaction. results: all the pathogens studied were detected in dentate and edentulous subjects. when cheek and tongue samples were combined, c.  rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans and e. corrodens presented with a similar prevalence in both groups, whereas the other species were more prevalent specifically in the dentate group (p<0.05). in dentate subjects, p. intermedia and t. denticola were present in higher frequencies in the cheek mucosa (26.67% and 66.67%, respectively), whereas p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were more prevalent in the tongue samples (26.67% and 56.67%, respectively). conclusions: periodontal pathogens may persist in the oral cavity of edentulous subjects who have had periodontal disease, even 1 year after the extraction of all teeth and in the absence of other hard surfaces in the mouth.

AB  == backgroud and objective: genetic factors may influence the colonization of pathogenic bacteria, therefore increasing the risk for the initiation and development of periodontal disease. the present study was carried out to investigate the association of cd14-260 polymorphisms, subgingival microbiota, and gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) cytokine levels with cyclosporine a (csa)-induced gingival overgrowth (go) in renal transplant patients. material and methods: a total of 204 patients were dichotomized into two groups: 124 with go and 80 without go. the cd14-260 polymorphisms were measured using an allele-specific pcr method. the levels of periodontal pathogens were determined by real-time pcr of subgingival samples. gcf levels of il-1beta and scd14 were detected by elisa. results: the frequency of cd14-260 genotype ct + tt was found  to be similar in both groups. patients with go presented increased prevalence of  pg, td, and tf (red complex) and significantly higher levels of interleukin -1beta than those without go. patients with go carrying ct + tt genotypes were found to have higher frequencies of pg, td, and tf than those carrying the cc genotype. furthermore, in the presence of red complex, ct + tt genotypes were associated with higher interleukin -1beta levels and severe go. multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the severity of go is not dependent on age, gender and pharmacological variables, being only associated with cd14-260 genotype and red complex periodontopathogens. conclusion: no association between  cd14-260 polymorphisms and the prevalence of go was revealed in renal transplant  patients administered csa. however, cd14-260 ct + tt genotypes are associated with the prevalence of red complex periodontopathogens in patients with go, and may thus play some role in the development of severe csa-induced go.

TI  == clinical and microbiological parameters in patients with self-ligating and conventional brackets during early phase of orthodontic treatment.
AB  == objective: to determine the effect of different bracket designs (conventional brackets and self-ligating brackets) on periodontal clinical parameters and periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque. material and methods: the following  inclusion criteria were used: requirement of orthodontic treatment plan starting  with alignment and leveling, good general health, healthy periodontium, no antibiotic therapy in the previous 6 months before the beginning of the study, and no smoking. the study sample totaled 38 patients (13 male, 25 female; mean age, 14.6 +/- 2.0 years). patients were divided into two groups with random distribution of brackets. recording of clinical parameters was done before the placement of the orthodontic appliance (t0) and at 6 weeks (t1), 12 weeks (t2), and 18 weeks (t3) after full bonding of orthodontic appliances. periodontal pathogens of subgingival microflora were detected at t3 using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test (micro-dent test) that contains probes for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. results: there was a statistically significant higher prevalence of a actinomycetemcomitans in patients with conventional brackets than in patients with self-ligating brackets, but there was no statistically significant difference for other putative periodontal pathogens. the two different types of brackets did not show statistically significant differences in periodontal clinical parameters. conclusion: bracket design does not seem to have a strong influence on periodontal clinical parameters and periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque.  the correlation between some periodontal pathogens and clinical periodontal parameters was weak.

TI  == [amalgam, composite and compomer: microbiological study].
AB  == restorative materials have different consequences on the periodontium. the surface of these materials may influence gingival health and cause in some instances gingival inflammation. the purpose of this study was to investigate and compare, in a healthy periodontium, intracrevicular plaque bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis and treponema denticola), at day 0 and at 6 months, around subgingivally located amalgam, composite and compomer fillings. all the tests were negative (less than 0.1% of the sum of 103 cells), since none  of the investigated pathogens were detected. it has been concluded that the material used does not have direct effect on the bacteria species developed around the restorations at this short time period.

TI  == subgingival microbiota from cebus apella (capuchin monkey) with different periodontal conditions.
AB  == this present study evaluated the subgingival microbiota of the cebus apella with  different periodontal conditions kept by the tufted capuchin monkey procreation center (sao paulo state university - unesp) or free-ranging monkeys. for this purpose, clinical specimens of subgingival biofilm were collected from 52 monkeys, of both genders, 40 kept in captivity and 12 free-ranging monkeys. the primates were submitted to periodontal evaluation and biofilm samples were transferred to vmga iii transport medium and ultrapure water. the microbiota was  cultivated in selective and non-selective culture media and microbial dna was extracted and the presence of periodontal pathogens was evaluated using pcr and real-time pcr. the actinomycetes, fusobacteria, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobic rods, tannerella forsythia, staphylococci and streptococci represent the predominantly detected microorganisms. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, dialister pneumosintes and prevotella nigrescens were rarely observed, whereas treponema denticola was not found. populations of c. rectus, e. corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia and the total microbial load were significantly higher in animals with bone loss and, in smaller extension, in animals with gingival bleeding.

TI  == peripheral arterial disease associated with caries and periodontal disease.
AB  == background: peripheral arterial disease (pad) is an important cardiovascular disorder of the peripheral arteries. chronic infections, such as periodontitis, may play an important role in the etiology and pathophysiology of pad and other cardiovascular conditions. recently, streptococcus mutans has been found with high frequency in atheromatous plaques. the aim of this study is to evaluate the  possible clinical and microbiologic association between pad and periodontitis and dental caries. methods: thirty patients with pad and 30 control individuals were  selected. pad and its severity were established by the use of the ankle-brachial  index (abi). clinical attachment loss (al); probing depth; decayed, missing, and  filled teeth (dmft) index; and c-reactive protein (crp) levels were evaluated. the presence of bacterial dna from streptococcus mutans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was identified by polymerase chain reaction in subgingival biofilm and serum. results: patients with >/=30% al >/= 4 mm had six-fold increased risk of having pad (odds ratio = 8.18; 95% confidence interval = 1.21 to 35.23; p = 0.031). there was statistical difference in the crp (p = 0.0413) and dmft index (p = 0.0002), with elevated number of missing teeth (p = 0.0459) in the pad group compared with the control group. there were no significant differences in the frequency of bacteria in serum and subgingival plaque. conclusion: there was a positive relationship between periodontitis based on al and pad determined by the abi (odds ratio = 8.18).

TI  == serum antibodies to periodontal pathogens are a risk factor for alzheimer's disease.
AB  == background: chronic inflammation in periodontal disease has been suggested as a potential risk factor in alzheimer's disease (ad). the purpose of this study was  to examine serum antibody levels to bacteria of periodontal disease in participants who eventually converted to ad compared with the antibody levels in  control subjects. methods: serum samples from 158 participants in the biologically resilient adults in neurological studies research program at the university of kentucky were analyzed for immunoglobulin g antibody levels to seven oral bacteria associated with periodontitis, including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, treponema  denticola, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia. all 158 participants were cognitively intact at baseline venous blood draw. in all, 81 of the participants developed either mild cognitive impairment (mci) or ad or both, and 77 controls remained cognitively intact in the years of  follow-up. antibody levels were compared between controls and subjects with ad at baseline draw and after conversion and controls and subjects with mci at baseline draw and after conversion using the wilcoxon rank-sum test. ad and mci participants were not directly compared. linear regression models were used to adjust for potential confounding. results: antibody levels to f nucleatum and p intermedia were significantly increased (alpha = 0.05) at baseline serum draw in  the patients with ad compared with controls. these results remained significant when controlling for baseline age, mini-mental state examination score, and apolipoprotein epsilon 4 status. conclusions: this study provides initial data that demonstrate elevated antibodies to periodontal disease bacteria in subjects  years before cognitive impairment and suggests that periodontal disease could potentially contribute to the risk of ad onset/progression. additional cohort studies profiling oral clinical presentation with systemic response and ad and prospective studies to evaluate any cause-and-effect association are warranted.

TI  == oral bacteria and yeasts in relationship to oral ulcerations in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.
AB  == background: oral mucositis is a serious and debilitating side effect of conditioning regimens for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (hsct). through hsct, the homeostasis in the oral cavity is disrupted. the contribution of the oral microflora to mucositis remains to be clarified. the aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between yeasts, bacteria associated with periodontitis, and oral ulcerations in hsct recipients. methods: this prospective observational study included 49 adult hsct recipients. twice weekly, oral ulcerations were scored, and oral rinsing samples were obtained. samples were evaluated for the total bacterial load; the gram-negative bacteria: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, and  treponema denticola; and the yeasts: candida albicans, candida glabrata, candida  kefyr, candida krusei, candida parapsilosis, and candida tropicalis using real-time polymerase chain reaction with specific primers and probes. explanatory variables for oral ulcerations were calculated using the multilevel generalized estimated equations (gee) technique. results: none of the samples was positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans, while f. nucleatum was found most often (66 % of samples). c. albicans was the most isolated yeast (88 % of samples), whereas c. parapsilosis was found in only 8 % of the samples. multivariate gee analyses identified p. gingivalis, p. micra, t. denticola, f. nucleatum, c. glabrata, and  c. kefyr as significant explanatory variables of oral ulcerations. conclusions: our data indicate that p. gingivalis in particular, but also p. micra, t. denticola, f. nucleatum, c. glabrata, and c. kefyr may play a role in ulcerative  oral mucositis in patients undergoing hsct.

TI  == individual composition of human leukocyte antigens and periodontopathogens in the background of periodontitis.
AB  == background: human leukocyte antigens (hlas) are a basic precondition to induce the immune response to pathogens. therefore, this study evaluates associations among periodontitis, five key periodontopathic bacteria, and hlas to test their impact together with additional risk factors in multivariate analyses. methods: eighty-five patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp) and 71 patients with generalized chronic periodontitis (cp) were compared to 88 periodontitis-free controls. hla class i and ii typing was performed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with sequence-specific primers. subgingival plaque specimens were detected by pcr with sequence-specific oligonucleotides. risk-factor analyses were performed with respect to the cofactors age, sex, smoking, and plaque level by logistic regression. results: in the total patient group (gagp + cp), the adjusted odds ratio (or) of periodontitis was decreased in cases who were carriers of hla-b*57 (or = 0.259, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 0.086 to 0.782), hla-dqb1*08 (or = 0.404, 95% ci = 0.187 to 0.871), or the combination hla-drb1*04;drb4*;dqb1*0302 (or = 0.407, 95% ci = 0.185 to 0.895). moreover, individuals who expressed hla-drb1*04 (or = 0.36, 95% ci = 0.148 to 0.886) or hla-drb1*04;drb4*;dqb1*0302 (or = 0.29, 95% ci = 0.092 to 0.884) had a  decreased colonization risk with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. conclusions: certain hla markers were negatively associated to the manifestation  of a generalized periodontitis and/or the individual colonization of a. actinomycetemcomitans. the underlying mechanisms have to be investigated in future studies.

TI  == distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in dogs and their owners.
AB  == objective: presently, a large number of individuals consider their companion animals as family members and have close contact with them in daily life. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution of periodontopathic  bacterial species in oral specimens taken from dogs and their owners. design: dental plaque specimens were collected from 66 dogs and 81 members of 64 families who came to an animal clinic or dog training school in okayama, japan, in 2011. bacterial dna was extracted from each specimen and pcr analyses using primers specific for 11 periodontopathic species, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas gulae, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens were performed. results: p. gulae (71.2%), t. forsythia (77.3%), and c. rectus (66.7%) were frequently found in the dogs, whereas the detection rates of  those species in humans were less frequent at 16.0%, 30.9%, and 21.0%, respectively. p. gulae was identified in 13 human subjects and each of their dogs was also positive for the species. furthermore, e. corrodens and t. denticola in  specimens obtained from dogs were correlated with their presence in specimens from owners who had close contact with them. conclusions: these results suggest that several periodontopathic species could be transmitted between humans and their companion dogs, though the distribution of periodontopathic species in both is generally different.

TI  == comparative evaluation of the effects of different photoablative laser irradiation protocols on the gingiva of periodontopathic patients.
AB  == objective: we aimed at quantifying the presence of periodontopathogens in gingival biopsies from periodontitis patients treated with different photoablative lasers (diode gaas, er:yag, nd:yag, and co(2) lasers) and histologically analyzing their effects on the gingiva. background data: substantial evidence indicates that intracellular location of periodontal bacteria in the gingival epithelium may contribute to chronic periodontitis. methods: sixteen adult subjects with chronic periodontitis were subjected to conventional scaling/root planing and topical chlorhexidine, and immediately laser-irradiated on the inner and outer free gingiva. small gingival biopsies were subjected to real-time polymerase chain reaction and cytofluorescence to identify periodontopathogens; tissue damage and endothelial icam-1 expression were assessed by histological and immunofluorescence analyses. results: high dna  levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, and ekenella corrodens, were detected in all samples. nd:yag and diode lasers were capable of  eradicating periodontopathogenic bacteria endowed within gingival epithelial cells outside periodontal pockets, without causing connective tissue damage and microvessel rupture. they also reduced icam-1 immunolabelling by the vascular endothelium. conversely, er:yag lasers induced marked microvessel rupture and bleeding and failed to completely and selectively ablate the infected gingival epithelium, whereas co(2) laser caused heat-induced coagulation of the lamina propria. conclusions: this study indicates that periodontopathogens can persist within cells outside the pocket epithelium, despite conventional periodontal treatment. nd:yag and diode lasers are able to eradicate intra- and extracellular bacteria from these sites, suggesting that they can be considered suitable devices to improve the clinical outcome of periodontal disease.

TI  == necrotizing periodontal diseases in hiv-infected brazilian patients: a clinical and microbiologic descriptive study.
AB  == objective: nowadays, necrotizing periodontal diseases have a low prevalence; however, a better understanding of the etiopathogenesis of these diseases is necessary for determining more adequate preventive and therapeutic strategies. method and materials: from a pool of 1,232 hiv-infected patients, 15 presented with necrotizing periodontal diseases, which were evaluated by full-mouth periodontal clinical measurements. subgingival biofilm samples were collected from necrotizing lesions of six of these individuals. the presence and levels of  47 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: all 15 patients (10 had severe immunodeficiency) had been infected sexually. thirteen patients were taking antiretroviral medication (66.7% undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy). regarding necrotizing periodontal diseases, necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (60%) was more prevalent  than necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (40%). the frequency of supragingival biofilm and bleeding on probing ranged from 11.5% to 59.2% and 3.0% to 54.0%, respectively, whereas the mean probing depth and clinical attachment level were between 1.48 and 2.61 mm and 1.30 and 2.62 mm, respectively. species detected in  high prevalence and/or counts in necrotizing lesions included treponema denticola, eikenella corrodens, dialister pneumosintes, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus intermedius, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and campylobacter rectus. in contrast, parvimonas micra, prevotella melaninogenica, fusobacterium nucleatum, eubacterium nodatum, and helicobacter pylori were observed in the lowest mean prevalence and/or counts. conclusion: necrotizing periodontal disease lesions in hiv-infected patients present a microbiota with high prevalence and/or counts of classical periodontal pathogens, in particular t denticola, as well as species not commonly considered as periodontal pathogens, such as e faecalis and d pneumosintes. in addition, these individuals with necrotizing periodontal disease frequently display severe immunodeficiency and aids-defining diseases such as tuberculosis.

AB  == periodontal diseases are known to be major diseases in humans, and are also common in dogs. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution  of periodontitis-related bacterial species using oral swab specimens collected from 26 pet dogs. the distribution of an animal gingival organism porphyromonas gulae, in addition to 10 human periodontitis-related bacterial species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction with species-specific sets of primers. porphyromonas gulae, tannerella forsythia and campylobacter rectus were detected in almost all dogs analyzed, all of which should be regarded as common members of oral flora in dogs. then, isolation and identification of the porphyromonas species in swab specimens were performed. there were 35 strains isolated from 22 dogs, and broad-range polymerase chain reaction and sequencing methods revealed that approximately 70% of them were porphyromonas gulae. in contrast, the frequency of porphyromonas gingivalis was extremely low. these findings indicate the presence of specific periodontitis-related pathogens in pet dogs, especially porphyromonas gulae.

TI  == short-term periodontal and microbiological changes following orthognathic surgery.
AB  == objective: aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of orthognathic surgery on the development of periodontal and microbiological changes. materials  and methods: fifteen consecutively treated patients with a mean age of 24.9+/-7.7 years receiving orthognathic surgery were included in the present study. plaque index (pi) and concentrations of 11 periodonto-pathogenic bacteria were recorded  one day prior to surgery (t(0)) and one week (t(1)) and six weeks (t(2)) post-surgery. in addition, a complete periodontal examination including pocket probing depth (ppd), gingival recession (gr), clinical attachment level (cal), bleeding on probing (bop) and width of keratinized gingiva (wkg) was conducted at t(0) and t(2). for statistical analysis, general linear model and paired t-test were applied. results: a significant increase of pi (t(0)-t(1), p=0.037) was followed by a significant decrease (t(1)-t(2), p=0.017). apart from eikenella corrodens (p=0.036), no significant microbiological changes were recorded. ppd significantly increased on oral sites (p=0.045) and gr especially on buccal sites (p=0.001). in the incision area the development of gr was significantly higher on the test (buccal) than on the control sites (oral). both gingival biotypes were affected by gr. conclusions: orthognathic surgery causes statistically significant changes of periodontal parameters, but these changes do not necessarily impair the aesthetic appearance of the gingival margin.

TI  == simultaneous detection of periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque and placenta of women with hypertension in pregnancy.
AB  == background: there are many studies documenting increased prevalence of periodontal infection in women with preeclampsia. but, very few studies have attempted to establish causal relationship between the two. objective: to find out causal circumstantial evidence by isolating specific periodontal pathogens in oral and placental samples. materials and methods: antenatal periodontal screening and subgingival plaque collection was carried out in ten women with hypertension in pregnancy and ten normotensive controls on their hospital admission at term for cesarean delivery. placental biopsy was obtained after aseptic placental collection at the time of elective cesarean delivery. subgingival plaque and placental biopsy were studied for porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans using quantitative polymerase chain reaction technique. periodontist and laboratory personnel were unaware of case or control status. periodontal status was not informed to the obstetrician recruiting the cases and laboratory. microbiology report was not revealed till end of the study. results: periodontal pathogens were found to be high in the group with hypertension than the controls. p gingivalis was found in all the samples from subgingival plaque and placenta, irrespective of the periodontal disease status. conclusion: in cases with hypertension, periodontal pathogens are present in higher proportion in subgingival plaque and placenta.

TI  == microbiologic changes in subgingival plaque before and during the early period of orthodontic treatment.
AB  == objective: to evaluate changes in subgingival microbiota before and during the leveling and alignment orthodontic stage using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. materials and methods: thirty orthodontic patients (17 females and  13 males; aged 16.7 +/- 6.5 y) were included in this study. subgingival microbial samples were taken from the disto-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper central incisors, the left lower central incisors, the mesio-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper first molars, and the left lower first molars, at four  different times: at baseline, before placement of orthodontic appliances (t1), and 1 week (t2), 3 months (t3), and 6 months after placement of orthodontic appliances (t4). dna was extracted from the samples, and the 16s rrna-based pcr detection method was used to determine the prevalence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, campylobactor rectus, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola, which are considered as putative periodontopathogens. results: the frequency of t forsythia, c rectus, and p nigrescens significantly increased after placement of orthodontic appliances. for the other species, the frequency tended to increase but no statistically significant difference was noted. the frequency of the change, representing microorganisms not existing at t1 but newly developing at t2, t3, and t4, was higher at the molars than at the incisors. conclusion: the placement of orthodontic appliances affects the subgingival microbial composition even during  the early period of orthodontic treatment, increasing the prevalence of periodontopathogens, especially in the molar region.

TI  == clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic factors of orthodontic treatment-induced gingival enlargement.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to investigate the microbiologic and immunologic factors related to orthodontic treatment-induced gingival enlargement (ge). methods: our study included 12 patients with ge undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment and 12 periodontally healthy controls. at baseline, periodontal variables, subgingival plaque samples, and gingival crevicular fluid  (gcf) samples were taken from 2 preselected sites in both the ge and the control  groups. the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and tannerella  forsythia were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. gcf interleukin (il)-1beta and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (tgf-beta1) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (invitrogen, camarillo, calif). periodontal therapy was given to the ge group, and all parameters were reassessed after 4 weeks. results: at baseline, the ge group showed higher prevalences of the 5 periodontal pathogens than did the control group (p <0.05). il-1beta and tgf-beta1 levels at the ge sites were also significantly higher than those at the control sites (p <0.05). four weeks after periodontal therapy, the ge group showed significant improvements in the clinical parameters associated with significant reductions of p gingivalis, a actinomycetemcomitans, and t denticola. the levels of il-1beta decreased significantly compared with the baseline (p <0.05), whereas there was no significant change in tgf-beta1 levels (p >0.05). conclusions: periodontal pathogens might have a relationship with the initiation  and development of orthodontic treatment-induced ge. inflammatory cytokines (il-1beta and tgf-beta1) can also be considered as contributing factors.

TI  == [prevalence of helicobacter pylori detected by real-time pcr in the subgingival plaque of patients with chronic periodontitis].
AB  == background: helicobacter pylori plays a significant role in gastric disease. the  aim of the present pilot study was to evaluate the prevalence of h. pylori detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time pcr) in the sub-gingival plaque of chronic periodontitis patients and to determine periodontopathogens profile of positive sites at h. pylori. methodology: 109 subgingival samples collected from 17 subjects with chronic periodontitis were studied. the dna was extracted from the oral samples and analyzed for the presence of h. pylori by real-time pcr (lightcycler) using 16s rrna#120 primers which targeted the 16s rrna gene. dna from h. pylori dsm 4867 was used as a positive control. seven bacteria implicated in chronic periodontitis were selected to explore the presence of these periodontopathic species in the oral positive sites for h. pylori. results: 16 of 109 samples (14.7%) were positives of h. pylori. all the positives sites were also positives to fusobacterium nucleatum and eikenella corrodens, 62.5% to porphyromonas gingivalis, 31.25% to treponema denticola, 25% to prevotella intermedia, 12.5% to aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and 6.25% to tannerella forsythia. conclusions: h. pylori may be present in the subgingival plaque samples of patients with chronic periodontitis who are resident in a developing country. f. nucleatum and e. corrodens could coaggregate with h. pylori in the subgingival dental plaque.

TI  == a novel approach to the use of subgingival controlled-release chlorhexidine delivery in chronic periodontitis: a randomized clinical trial.
AB  == background: we aimed to analyze clinical, microbiologic, and serologic effects of chlorhexidine (chx) chips used as a subgingival controlled-release delivery device before and immediately after scaling and root planing (srp). methods: twenty-four patients presenting with >/=12 teeth with probing depth (pd) >/=5 mm  and bleeding on probing were assigned in test or control groups. after prophylaxis, chx chips (test) or placebo chips (control) were placed in pockets with pd >/=5 mm. ten days later, srp was performed in all teeth with pd >/=4 mm in a single appointment. immediately after srp, new chips were inserted in all pockets with pd >/=5 mm. parameters were assessed at baseline; beginning of srp;  and 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment. subgingival samples were obtained at baseline; beginning of srp; and at 1 month after treatment. periodontal pathogens aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were analyzed. serum levels of high sensitive c-reactive and lipopolysaccharide-binding proteins were  measured. the changes of the parameters between and within the groups were tested by mann-whitney u test (p <0.05). results: all clinical and serologic parameters  improved in both groups over time. there was a significant difference in clinical attachment level (cal) gain from baseline to 6 months between groups (1.17 mm in  the test group versus 0.79 mm in the placebo group) (p <0.05). the treatment with chx chips showed a greater reduction of the microorganisms of the "red complex" after 1 month (p = 0.02). conclusion: the use of chx chips before and immediately after srp improved cal and reduced the subgingival microorganisms of the red complex in the treatment of chronic periodontitis.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == effect of teenage smoking on the prevalence of periodontal bacteria.
AB  == the aim of our study was to investigate how teenage smoking affects the prevalence of periodontal bacteria and periodontal health with the hypothesis that smoking increases the prevalence of the bacteria. oral health of 264 adolescents (15- to 16-year-olds) was clinically examined, and their smoking history was recorded. the participants also filled in a structured questionnaire  recording their general health and health habits. pooled subgingival plaque samples were taken for polymerase chain reaction analysis of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola. the prevalence of p.  intermedia (21% vs. 4%, p = 0.01) and t. forsythia and t. denticola (23% vs. 8%,  p < 0.05, for both) was higher among female smokers than among non-smokers. t. forsythia and t. denticola were more often associated with bleeding on probing (29% vs. 12%; 25% vs. 10%, respectively) and deep pockets (25% vs. 15%; 23% vs. 10%, respectively) with smokers than non-smokers. among the girls, a significant  association was found between pack-years and the prevalence of p. nigrescens (p < 0.007). in both genders, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were rare in  this study. to conclude, periodontal bacteria were associated with higher periodontal index scores among all teenage smokers. smoking girls harbored more frequently certain periodontal bacteria than non-smokers, but this was not seen in boys. hence, our study hypothesis was only partly confirmed.

TI  == identification of periodontal pathogens and severity of periodontitis in patients with and without chronic kidney disease.
AB  == objective: in this study of patients with chronic periodontitis (cp), the severity of the disease and the main periodontal pathogens identified in patients with chronic kidney disease (ckd) were compared with those detected in individuals without systemic disease. design: nineteen patients with cp without evidence of systemic disease (control group), 25 patients with cp and ckd who were in the pre-dialysis stages (pre-dialysis group), and 22 patients with cp and ckd who were on renal replacement therapy (rrt group) were examined. the severity of cp was based on the investigation of probing depth (pd) and clinical attachment level (cal). the definition and stage of ckd were based on the criteria proposed by the kidney disease outcomes quality initiative of the national kidney foundation. glomerular filtration rate (gfr) was estimated using  the equation of modification of diet in renal disease and the identification of microorganisms in subgingival plaque was performed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: candida albicans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were more common in patients who were on rrt and pre-dialysis than in control subjects. cp was more severe in patients with ckd. a strong association was observed between the frequency of c. albicans (p =  0.056), p.gingivalis (p = 0.008), t. denticola (p = 0.013) and cal, when ckd patients were compared with the control group. conclusion: cp is more severe and  is associated with increased frequency of c. albicans, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola in patients with ckd.

TI  == effect of smoking on subgingival microflora of patients with periodontitis in japan.
AB  == background: smoking is a risk factor for periodontitis. to clarify the contribution of smoking to periodontitis, it is essential to assess the relationship between smoking and the subgingival microflora. the aim of this study was to gain an insight into the influence of smoking on the microflora of japanese patients with periodontitis. methods: sixty-seven japanese patients with chronic periodontitis (19 to 83 years old, 23 women and 44 men) were enrolled in  the present study. they consisted of 30 smokers and 37 non-smokers. periodontal parameters including probing pocket depth (ppd) and bleeding on probing (bop) and oral hygiene status were recorded. detection of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum, treponema denticola  and campylobacter rectus in subgingival plaque samples was performed by polymerase chain reaction. association between the detection of periodontopathic  bacteria and smoking status was analyzed by multiple logistic regression analysis and chi-square test. results: a statistically significant association was found between having a ppd >/= 4 mm and detection of t. denticola, p. intermedia, t. forsythia, or c. rectus, with odds ratios ranging from 2.17 to 3.54. a significant association was noted between bop and the detection of c. rectus or p. intermedia, and smoking, with odds ratios ranging from 1.99 to 5.62. prevalence of c. rectus was higher in smokers than non-smokers, whereas that of a. actinomycetemcomitans was lower in smokers. conclusions: within limits, the analysis of the subgingival microbial flora in smokers and non-smokers with chronic periodontitis suggests a relevant association between smoking and colonization by the specific periodontal pathogens including c. rectus.

TI  == the effect of a single episode of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy in the treatment of experimental periodontitis. microbiological profile and cytokine pattern in the dog mandible.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a single application of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) on microbiological profile and cytokine pattern in dogs. periodontal disease was induced by placing 3.0 silk ligatures around the mandibular pre-molars bilaterally during 8 weeks. the dogs were randomly treated with apdt using a dye/laser system, scaling and root planning (srp), or with the association of treatments (srp + apdt). plaque samples were collected at baseline, 1, 3, and 4 weeks, and the mean counts of 40 species were  determined using dna-dna hybridization. gingival biopsies were removed and the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), receptor activator of nf-kb ligand (rankl), osteoprotegerin (opg), matrix metalloproteinase (mmp-1), interleukin (il) 6, il-10 and total bacterial load by analysis of 16 s rrna gene  were evaluated through real-time pcr. the results shows that the levels of the majority of the species were reduced 1 week post-therapy for all treatments, however, an increase in counts of prevotella intermedia (p = 0.00), prevotella. nigrescens (p = 0.00) and tannerella forsythia (p = 0.00) was observed for apdt and srp + apdt. after 4 weeks, a regrowth of porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.00)  and treponema denticola (p = 0.00), was observed for all treatments. also, a strikingly reduction of counts on counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was observed for the apdt (p = 0.00). for the cytokine pattern, the results were  similar for all treatments, and a reduction in the expression of cytokines and bacterial load was observed throughout the study. our results suggest that srp, apdt in a single application, and srp + apdt affects different bacterial species  and have similar effects on the expression of cytokines evaluated during the treatment of ligature-induced periodontitis.

AB  == purpose: to characterize the normal bacterial flora and evaluate the presence of  periodontopathogenic bacteria around dental implants and to correlate them with the periodontal flora or, in completely edentulous patients, the alveolar gingival flora. materials and methods: clinical and radiographic parameters were  recorded to exclude peri-implantitis in 34 partially edentulous and 19 completely edentulous patients. partially edentulous patients were subdivided into two subgroups based on the depth of the periodontal pocket: </= 4 mm (n = 19) and > 4 mm (n = 15). microbial samples were collected from peri-implant sulci, the deepest periodontal sulci, and, for completely edentulous patients, from the alveolar gingiva. predominant aerobic bacteria were determined by microbiologic culturing, and multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used to detect five periodontopathogenic bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. results: in all the examined patients, oral streptococci were the most frequent aerobic peri-implant bacteria. the frequency of four periodontopathogenic bacteria in tooth sulci (a actino?mycetemcomitans, p gingivalis, t forsythensis, t denticola) was significantly higher around natural  teeth with deeper periodontal pockets, but there was no significant difference in the frequency of the same bacteria in peri-implant sulci in the two partially edentulous subgroups. in contrast, there were no such bacteria in the peri-implant sulci or the alveolar gingiva of completely edentulous patients. conclusions: in healthy peri-implant sulci, oral streptococci constitute the predominant bacterial flora. in partially edentulous patients four periodontopathogenic bacteria were detected around implants, and none of these bacteria were found around implants in completely edentulous patients.

TI  == examination of periodontal pathogens in stenotic valve specimens and in whole blood samples in patients affected by aortic valve stenosis and chronic periodontitis.
AB  == periodontitis may be a risk factor for atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. the influence of periodontal pathogens in cardiovascular diseases needs  further investigation. therefore, the aims of this clinical study are: to test the presence of periodontal bacteria dna in aortic valves and to assess the concomitant presence of the same periodontal bacteria dna in whole blood samples  in patients affected by aortic valve stenosis and chronic periodontitis. nineteen consecutive patients (12 males and 7 females, age: 49-85 years) were enrolled in  this study after having been subjected to a complete periodontal evaluation to confirm the diagnosis of chronic periodontitis. all patients were scheduled for aortic valve replacement surgery. after clinical and microbial periodontal examination, the aortic valve tissue specimens were obtained by excision during valve replacement surgery and the patients were subjected to the whole blood sampling before the surgery. the polymerase chain reaction technology was used to detect the putative periodontal pathogens tannerella forshytia, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens and treponema  denticola. neither the 19 aortic valve specimens nor the blood samples were positive for the genoma of the selected periodontal pathogens. the selected periodontal pathogens did not colonize the aortic valve of patients affected by stenosis and bacterial genoma was not present in whole blood samples. a high blood pressure at the aortic valve may prevent the adhesion and proliferation of  bacterial colonies.

AB  == background and objective: periodontitis is influenced by specific host-dependent  immune responses. periodontopathogens induce innate immune responses, amongst others, via toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2), resulting in activation of the nuclear transcription factor nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab). the aim of this case-control study was to evaluate links between genetic variants of these genes  and chronic/aggressive periodontitis in a multivariate model. material and methods: a total of 141 patients with periodontitis (63 with chronic periodontitis and 78 with aggressive periodontitis) and 81 controls without periodontitis were included in the study. polymorphisms in tlr2 (arg677trp, arg753gln) and in nf-kappab (-94ins/delattg) were determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism and fragment length analyses, respectively. subgingival bacterial colonization was evaluated using a pcr/dna probe test (micro-ident). results: although there was no association of the tlr2 polymorphism arg753gln with periodontitis, heterozygous carriers (arg/gln) were at a higher risk for colonization with bacteria of the 'red complex' (corrected p-value = 0.042). the del/del genotype of the nf-kappab polymorphism was associated with aggressive periodontitis considering age, gender, smoking and approximal plaque index as potential confounders (odds ratio = 2.81, p = 0.035, 95% confidence interval: 1.08-7.33). del/del carriers had a higher risk for subgingival colonization with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (odds ratio = 2.36, p = 0.030, 95% confidence interval: 1.09-5.1; adjusted for age, gender, smoking and pocket depth(bacteria)). conclusions: the del/del genotype of nf-kappab was shown to be associated with the occurrence of aggressive periodontitis.

TI  == do elderly edentulous patients with a history of periodontitis harbor periodontal pathogens?
AB  == objectives: the presence of periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity may impact implant survival. therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, eikenella corrodens and parvimonas micra in a specific elderly population with a history of periodontitis who have never worn dentures. material and methods: thirty dentate subjects (mean age 61.7+/-7.05 years) and 30 edentulous subjects (mean age 65.8+/-8.05 years) were included in this cross-sectional study. microbiological samples of cheek mucosa and the dorsum of  the tongue were taken from all subjects. in addition, sulcus samples were taken from the dentate group. all samples were analysed using a bacterial dna-specific  polymerase chain reaction. results: all the pathogens studied were detected in dentate and edentulous subjects. when cheek and tongue samples were combined, c.  rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans and e. corrodens presented with a similar prevalence in both groups, whereas the other species were more prevalent specifically in the dentate group (p<0.05). in dentate subjects, p. intermedia and t. denticola were present in higher frequencies in the cheek mucosa (26.67% and 66.67%, respectively), whereas p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were more prevalent in the tongue samples (26.67% and 56.67%, respectively). conclusions: periodontal pathogens may persist in the oral cavity of edentulous subjects who have had periodontal disease, even 1 year after the extraction of all teeth and in the absence of other hard surfaces in the mouth.

TI  == photodynamic therapy in periodontal therapy: microbiological observations from a  private practice.
AB  == in recent years, the combination of laser light and photosensitizer known as photodynamic therapy (pdt) has been used in periodontal therapy. however, there are not enough clinical studies to fully evaluate the effects of pdt on the periodontal tissues. this microbiological study examined the effects of pdt on the periodontal bacteria in combination with scaling and root planing (srp) in the same group of patients by randomly selecting pdt or srp for use in different  quadrants of the mouth. for the present study, pdt was compared with a diode laser (980 nm) and an nd:ya g laser (1,064 nm). microbiological samples were examined and evaluated over a period of three months. significant bacterial reduction has been observed in all cases. the diode laser with srp presented long-term positive results, while pdt showed a significant bacteria reduction during the entire observation period.

TI  == efficacy of amoxicillin and metronidazole combination for the management of generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of metronidazole-amoxicillin combination on clinical and microbiologic parameters in patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis. methods: twenty-eight patients were randomly included. the test group (n = 12) received amoxicillin-metronidazole combination and scaling and root planing; the control group (n = 16) received scaling and root planing alone. in addition to the clinical examinations, subgingival plaque samples were analyzed for total cultivable bacteria and the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella pallens, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) using polymerase chain reaction. results: all clinical parameters improved significantly compared to baseline (p <0.05) in both groups. there was a statistically significant reduction of pockets and clinical attachment gain in the combined group compared to the control group (p <0.05). total counts of bacteria also decreased significantly at 3 and 6 months in both groups (p <0.05). t. denticola and t. forsythia were the most prevalent bacteria throughout the study. t. denticola showed a continuous decrease over 6 months in the test group, whereas no change was seen in the control group beyond 3 months. p. gingivalis decreased significantly at 3 months (p <0.05), whereas t. forsythia was the only  pathogen decreased below detection limits by the combination therapy with a significant difference compared to the control group (p <0.05). conclusions: the  results from this study suggest that combined amoxicillin and metronidazole use as an adjunct to scaling and root planing leads to better clinical healing compared to mechanical treatment alone. the polypharmaceutical approach used results in a significant and substantial decrease in t. forsythia and prevents its recolonization for 6 months, suggesting that t. forsythia may determine the long-term stability of periodontal treatment outcomes.

TI  == the relationship between physiologic halitosis and periodontopathic bacteria of the tongue and gingival sulcus.
AB  == to determine the influence of oral status on halitosis, the relationship between  halitosis and periodontopathic bacteria present in plaque on the tongue and the subgingival sulcus was examined in 62 periodontally healthy adults. halitosis indicators used were the organoleptic score; gas chromatography results [total volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) = h(2)s + ch(3)sh + (ch(3))(2)s]; halimeter values; and the results of three clinical tests, plaque control record (plcr), plaque index (pli), and tongue coat status. significant correlations with organoleptic scores was observed for plcr, pli, tongue coat status, vsc amounts,  and halimeter values, indicating that halitosis in periodontally healthy subjects tended to originate from tongue plaque deposits. polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to detect six periodontopathic bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis, and treponema denticola) from the tongue and subgingival plaque. significant effects on the organoleptic scores, tongue coat status, total vsc, h(2)s and ch(3)sh amounts, and halimeter values were observed only for t. denticola and f. nucleatum and only in the tongue plaque, not in the subgingival plaque. thus, therapies developed to inhibit the growth of these bacteria may lead to future treatments of halitosis.

TI  == [detection of periodental pathogens in atherosclerotic lesions in patients].
AB  == objective: to detect periodontopathic bacterial dna in atherosclerotic vascular lesions in a group of chinese patients by using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) techniques. methods: ten human specimens of atherosclerotic plaque were obtained  sterilely. the sclerotic lesions were blade into fine pieces and dna was isolated from the samples. to detect porphyromonas gingivalis(pg), tannerella forsythia(tf), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans(aa), prevotella intermedia(pi), prevotella nigrescens(pn), treponema denticola(td), campylobacter rectus(cr), pcr amplification of bacterial 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) was carried out. results: pcr assays for bacterial 16s rdna indicated the presence of periodontal pathogens in 3 out of 10 surgical specimens. dna of pg were found in  3 samples, tf was found only in one among the 3 samples and pn was found in another sample among the 3 samples. conclusion: the data confirm that dna of periodontal pathogens present in atherosclerotic plaques. pg, tf, pn may play a role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis in these chinese patients. further studies with large size samples are needed.

TI  == microbiologic testing and outcomes of full-mouth scaling and root planing with or without amoxicillin/metronidazole in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: it has been suggested that use of systemic antibiotics should be limited to patients with specific microbiologic profiles. the main purpose of the present analysis was to study whether microbiologic testing before therapy was of value in predicting which patients would specifically benefit from adjunctive amoxicillin and metronidazole, given in the context of full-mouth scaling and root planing (srp) within 48 hours. methods: this was a 6-month, single-center, double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomized longitudinal study. fifty-one patients received full-mouth periodontal debridement, performed within 48 hours;  then, 25 subjects received metronidazole, 500 mg, and amoxicillin, 375 mg, three  times a day for 7 days, and 26 received a placebo (control group). pooled microbiologic samples were taken from the deepest pocket at baseline in each quadrant before and 6 months after treatment. six periodontal pathogens were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: forty-seven patients  were followed for 6 months. after treatment, test subjects had a substantially lower mean number of persisting sites with probing depth >4 mm and bleeding on probing than did control subjects (0.4 versus 3.0; p = 0.005; month 6). aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) could not be detected in the antibiotic group after treatment. however, in the placebo group, three of six subjects positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans continued to be positive. lower frequencies were also noted in the test group for porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.013) and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (p = 0.007). however, even subjects testing negative for a. actinomycetemcomitans at baseline had a significantly better primary clinical outcome if they received the active drugs. the presence of six putative periodontal pathogens (a. actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum spp., p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and t. forsythia) quantified prior to therapy was not correlated with the outcome of full-mouth srp with or without amoxicillin and metronidazole. conclusion: excellent clinical results in the antibiotics group were obtained regardless of the presence or absence of six classic periodontal periopathogens prior to treatment.

TI  == transmission of periodontopathic bacteria from natural teeth to implants.
AB  == purpose: prevention of peri-implantitis is essential for the success of implant rehabilitation. infection by periodontopathic bacteria is a major cause of peri-implantitis. the aim of the present study was to identify the source of peri-implant colonization by periodontopathic bacteria. materials and methods: twenty-one patients with implants were enrolled in the study. subgingival plaque  samples from the adjacent, occluding, and contralateral natural teeth were collected prior to second-stage surgery. samples from implant sulci were then obtained 2 weeks later. detection of periodontopathic bacteria was performed by the polymerase chain reaction. results: the detection rates for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and fusobacterium nucleatum in all subgingival samples from natural teeth were similar to that in the peri-implant sulci. multiple logistic regression analysis revealed an association between the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and f. nucleatum in the gingival crevices of adjacent teeth and that of the peri-implant sulcus, but no association for tannerella forsythia. conclusions: the present findings suggest that colonization by a. actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and f. nucleatum at the implant sulcus was affected by these microorganisms in the gingival crevice of adjacent teeth rather than those on occluding and contralateral teeth.

TI  == microbiologic changes in subgingival plaque after removal of fixed orthodontic appliances.
AB  == objective: to evaluate changes that occur in the subgingival microbiota after removal of fixed orthodontic appliances using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). materials and methods: thirty orthodontic patients (11 males and 19 females; aged 20 +/- 7.3 yr) were included in this study. subgingival plaque samplings were gathered from the disto-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper central incisors and the left lower central incisors, and from the mesio-buccal gingival  crevice of the left upper first molars and the left lower first molars, at two different times: 2 weeks before appliance removal (t1), and 3 months after appliance removal (t2). dna was extracted from the samples and the 16s rrna-based pcr detection method was used to determine the prevalence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans , tannerella forsythia , campylobacter rectus , eikenella corrodens , porphyromonas gingivalis , prevotella intermedia , prevotella nigrescens , and treponema denticola , which are considered as putative periodontopathogens. results: the frequency of positive sites at t1 and t2 was 65% and 43.3% for c. rectus , and 53.3% and 30.8% for e. corrodens , respectively. for the other bacteria, the frequency tended to be reduced between  times. conclusion: periodontopathogens during orthodontic treatment were significantly reduced within 3 months of appliance removal. however, how long it  takes to return to the preorthodontic composition of the subgingival microbiota and whether it happens at all remain to be seen.

TI  == photodynamic therapy of persistent pockets in maintenance patients-a clinical study.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the short-term performance of a session of single photodynamic therapy (pdt) and of a conventional ultrasonic debridement (ust) in persistent pockets of maintenance patients. in a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind clinical study, patients with chronic periodontitis with at least two persistent pockets (>4 mm) were enrolled. they were treated either with ust (n = 29) or pdt (n = 25). clinical and microbiological examinations were performed at baseline and after 3 months. for ust, the mean probing depth was reduced from 5.3 to 4.5 mm (p = <0.001) and for pdt from 5.3 to 4.7 mm (p < 0.001) with no difference between the two treatment modalities. microbial counts were significantly reduced about 30% to 40% immediately after debridement but returned to baseline values a 3 months irrespective of treatment. pdt is not superior to conventional mechanical treatment of persistent pockets, but it may be a meaningful therapeutic alternative; the clinical effects were too minor to draw a definitive conclusion.

TI  == salivary interleukin-1beta concentration and the presence of multiple pathogens in periodontitis.
AB  == aim: this study aimed to find salivary enzymes and/or cytokines that would reflect periodontitis, alone or in combination with salivary microbial markers. material and methods: the salivary concentrations of elastase, lactate dehydrogenase, interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), interleukin-6, and tumour necrosis factor-alpha, and the presence of five periodontal pathogens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola, were analysed from salivary specimens of 165 subjects, a subpopulation of health 2000 health examination survey in finland; 84 of the subjects had probing pocket depth (ppd) of > or =4 mm at 14 or more teeth (the advanced periodontitis group), while 81 subjects had  no teeth with ppd of > or =4 mm (the control group). all subjects had at least 20 teeth and no systemic diseases. results: among the salivary cytokines and enzymes tested, il-1beta was the only biomarker associated with periodontitis. an association was also found with the presence of multiple periodontal pathogens. salivary il-1beta and the presence of multiple periodontal pathogens were associated with periodontitis at the same magnitude, when they were in the logistic regression model individually or together. conclusion: we suggest that salivary il-1beta and the presence of multiple periodontal pathogens in saliva should be studied more thoroughly as markers of periodontitis.

TI  == distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in japanese children with developmental disabilities.
AB  == background: recent developments in molecular biological techniques have enabled rapid detection of periodontopathic bacterial species in clinical specimens. accumulated evidence suggests that detection of specific bacterial species enables identification of subjects at high risk for the onset of periodontitis. we investigated the distribution of 10 selected periodontopathic bacterial species in dental plaque specimens obtained from children with disabilities who were attending daycare centers. methods: a total of 187 children (136 boys, 51 girls) aged 1-6 years old and diagnosed with such disabilities as mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and autism, participated in the study. subgingival dental plaque specimens were collected from the buccal side of the maxillary left second primary molar after a clinical examination. bacterial dna was extracted from the specimens and pcr analyses were carried out to detect 10 selected periodontopathic species using specific primers for each. in addition, statistical analyses were performed to analyze the correlations among clinical parameters and the detected species. results: the most frequently detected species was capnocytophaga sputigena (28.3%), followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (20.9%) and campylobacter rectus (18.2%). eikenella corrodens, capnocytophaga ochracea, and prevotella nigrescence were detected in approximately 10% of the specimens, whereas treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia were rarely found, and porphyromonas gingivalis was not detected in any of the subjects. the total numbers of detected species were positively correlated with the age of the subjects. there were 10 subjects with positive reactions for t. denticola and/or t. forsythia, in whom the total number of bacterial species was significantly higher as compared to the other subjects. furthermore, subjects possessing c. rectus showed significantly greater values for periodontal pocket depth, gingival index, and total number of  species. conclusion: we found that approximately one-fourth of the present subjects with disabilities who possessed at least one of t. denticola, t. forsythia, and c. rectus were at possible risk for periodontitis. follow-up examinations as well as preventive approaches should be utilized for such individuals.

TI  == one-stage full-mouth versus partial-mouth scaling and root planing during the effective half-life of systemically administered azithromycin.
AB  == background: one-stage full-mouth scaling and root planing (fm-srp) in combination with systemically administered azithromycin was shown to be clinically and bacteriologically effective in the treatment of chronic periodontitis. however, fm-srp requires 2 hours for completion. azithromycin has a long half-life. therefore, if srp of the full mouth is performed within 7 days while an effective concentration of azithromycin remains in the gingiva, the effects may be the same as fm-srp. the aim of this study was to compare the clinical and bacteriologic effects of fm-srp and partial-mouth scaling and root planing (pm-srp) in patients with chronic periodontitis, which was performed in three sessions within 7 days,  during the effective half-life of systemically administrated azithromycin. methods: thirty adult subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomly divided into three groups (fm-srp, pm-srp, and control). a clinical examination was conducted to record the probing depth, clinical attachment level gain, bleeding on probing, gingival index, and volume of gingival crevicular fluid; bacterial samples were obtained before treatment and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months thereafter.  quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed using the polymerase chain reaction-invader method. results: all clinical parameters showed better improvement in fm-srp and pm-srp groups compared to the control group, with no significant differences between the two test groups. periodontal bacteria were well controlled in the two test groups, but they tended to increase gradually 3 months after treatment in the control group. conclusion: pm- and fm-srp demonstrated comparable clinical and bacteriologic results.

TI  == bone microbial contamination influences autogenous grafting in sinus augmentation.
AB  == background: the oral occurrence of putative microbial pathogens in humans has been documented in health and disease. the presence of periodontopathogens in patients with a history of periodontal disease may have a negative impact on bone regeneration. this investigation was conducted to confirm the presence of periodontal pathogens in bone particles harvested intraorally for maxillary sinus augmentation and to assess the clinical and radiographic outcomes 6 to 12 months  after bone augmentation. methods: culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based identification were performed by paper-point sampling of intraorally  harvested bone particles in a group of 12 maintenance patients undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation. radiographs were taken to assess and compare bone healing and volume gain at baseline and at 6 to 12 months after augmentation. results: the presence of periodontal pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans [previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans], prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia [previously t. forsythensis], fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra [previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros], campylobacter rectus, enteric gram-negative rods, and dialister pneumosintes) was identified in 10 of 12 patients (83%) by culture, pcr, or both and was associated with greater bone volume loss at 6 months postaugmentation. the pcr-positive triad, p. gingivalis,  a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. intermedia, was associated with pronounced volume loss of the grafted sinus at 6 months. conclusions: to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to confirm osseous microbial contamination with major periodontopathogens in individuals undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation with a history of periodontitis. the effect on the grafting outcome  translated into bone volume loss in the grafted sinus 6 months postaugmentation.  specific microbial contamination may have an impact on osteogenesis in osseous regeneration.

TI  == microbiological profile of untreated subjects with localized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == aim: the microbial profile of localized aggressive periodontitis (lagp) has not yet been determined. therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the subgingival microbial composition of lagp. material and methods: one hundred and  twenty subjects with lagp (n=15), generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp, n=25), chronic periodontitis (chp, n=30) or periodontal health (ph, n=50) underwent clinical and microbiological assessment. nine subgingival plaque samples were collected from each subject and analysed for their content of 38 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: red complex  and some orange complex species are the most numerous and prevalent periodontal pathogens in lagp. the proportions of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were  elevated in shallow and intermediate pockets of lagp subjects in comparison with  those with gagp or chp, but not in deep sites. this species also showed a negative correlation with age and with the proportions of red complex pathogens.  the host-compatible actinomyces species were reduced in lagp. conclusion: a. actinomycetemcomitans seems to be associated with the onset of lagp, and porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum and prevotella intermedia play an important role in disease progression. successful treatment of lagp would involve a reduction in these pathogens and an increase in the actinomyces species.

TI  == detection and quantification of five major periodontal pathogens by single copy gene-based real-time pcr.
AB  == periodontitis is a common chronic multibacterial infection in the tooth-supporting tissues. it has been shown that periodontitis patients carry higher number of disease-associated bacteria than healthy ones. the aim of this study was to generate a novel, single copy gene-based quantitative real-time pcr  (qpcr) assay for five major periodontal pathogens - aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia. the primer/probe sets were designed for conservative lipopolysaccharide-coding gene regions. they proved to be sensitive  and able to detect strains representing different serotypes of the target bacteria. the specificity of designed primers was tested using 49 selected bacterial species and no false positive or negative results were observed. we validated the assay with a case-control population, including 165 saliva samples, and proved the diagnostic accuracy by receiver operating characteristic (roc) curves. all quantified pathogens alone were able to distinguish significantly between the subjects with and without periodontitis, and provided areas under the roc curve larger than 0.5. the total pathogen burden comprising all five species  associated with periodontitis with an area of 0.821 (95% ci, 0.758-0.885, p50.001). our prominently sensitive and specific assay may have major importance  in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of periodontitis.

AB  == background and objective: as a pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-2 mediates  the activation, growth and differentiation of t and b lymphocytes and natural killer cells. promoter polymorphisms of the interleukin-2 gene have been associated with altered interleukin-2 production or identified as prognostic markers for various infectious diseases. therefore, the aim of this study was to  evaluate two polymorphisms at positions -330 t/g and 166 g/t in patients with generalized chronic periodontitis (n = 58) or generalized aggressive periodontitis (n = 73) in comparison with periodontitis-free controls (n = 69). material and methods: both interleukin-2 polymorphisms were analyzed using the polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers. distributions of single alleles, genotypes and haplotypes were calculated using the chi-square test. risk factor analyses were carried out by logistic regression with respect to established cofactors for periodontitis. the presence of subgingival bacteria in  an individual were analyzed using a molecular biological method (the micro-ident  test). results: the interleukin-2 genotype -330 tg occurred less frequently in patients with chronic periodontitis (25.9% vs. 49.3%). moreover, this genotype decreased the adjusted odds ratio for chronic periodontitis (odds ratio = 0.394), whereas the interleukin-2 genotype 166 tt and the haplotype combination interleukin-2 -330,166 tt : tt were associated with an increased adjusted odds ratio (odds ratio = 2.82 or 2.97). for the latter interleukin-2 combination, a positive association for the subgingival presence of porphyromonas gingivalis (81.3% vs. 59.5%) and bacteria of the 'red complex' (78.1% vs. 56.0%) was shown.  conclusion: the interleukin-2 genotypes -330 tg and 166 tt, as well as the combination genotype interleukin-2 tt : tt, could be putative prognostic factors  for chronic periodontitis.

TI  == probiotic effects of orally administered lactobacillus salivarius wb21-containing tablets on periodontopathic bacteria: a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial.
AB  == aim: this study was designed to evaluate whether the oral administration of lactobacilli could change the bacterial population in supra/subgingival plaque. material and methods: sixty-six healthy volunteers without severe periodontitis were randomized into two groups to receive lactobacilli or placebo for 8 weeks (8w): the test group (n=34) received 2.01 x 10(9) cfu/day of lactobacillus salivarius wb21 and xylitol in tablets; the control group (n=32) received placebo with xylitol. supra/subgingival plaque samples were collected at the baseline and after 4 weeks (4w) and 8w. the bacterial amounts in plaque samples were analysed  by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: the numerical sum of five selected periodontopathic bacteria in the test group was decreased significantly in subgingival plaque at 4w [odds ratio (or)=3.13, 95% confidence intervals (ci)=1.28-7.65, p=0.012]. multivariate analysis showed that significantly higher odds were obtained for the reduction of tannerella forsythia in subgingival plaque of the test group at both 4w (or=6.69, 95% ci=2.51-17.9, p<0.001) and 8w (or=3.67, 95% ci=1.45-9.26, p=0.006). conclusion: oral administration of probiotic lactobacilli reduced the numerical sum of five selected periodontopathic bacteria and could contribute to the beneficial effects on periodontal conditions.

TI  == the microbiota on different oral surfaces in healthy children.
AB  == introduction: knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. methods: microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the dental school of the university of athens, who were split into three age groups. a total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: all of the test species, except parvimonas micra and porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial  profiles for the different oral surfaces. supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of actinomyces species and  green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the yellow complex. the profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. specifically, the red complex species (tannerella forsythia, p. gingivalis, treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (p < 0.05) in all sample locations. conclusions: the results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of orange and red  complex species.

TI  == are putative periodontal pathogens reliable diagnostic markers?
AB  == periodontitis is one of the most common chronic inflammatory diseases. a number of putative bacterial pathogens have been associated with the disease and are used as diagnostic markers. in the present study, we compared the prevalence of oral bacterial species in the subgingival biofilm of generalized aggressive periodontitis (gap) (n = 44) and chronic periodontitis (cp) (n = 46) patients with that of a periodontitis-resistant control group (pr) (n = 21). the control group consisted of subjects at least 65 years of age with only minimal or no periodontitis and no history of periodontal treatment. a total of 555 samples from 111 subjects were included in this study. the samples were analyzed by pcr of 16s rrna gene fragments and subsequent dot blot hybridization using oligonucleotide probes specific for aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, a treponema denticola-like phylogroup (treponema phylogroup ii), treponema lecithinolyticum, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium spp., and fusobacterium nucleatum, as well as capnocytophaga ochracea. our data confirm a high prevalence of the putative periodontal pathogens p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. forsythia in the periodontitis groups. however, these species  were also frequently detected in the pr group. for most of the species tested, the prevalence was more associated with increased probing depth than with the subject group. t. lecithinolyticum was the only periodontopathogenic species showing significant differences both between gap and cp patients and between gap  patients and pr subjects. c. ochracea was associated with the pr subjects, regardless of the probing depth. these results indicate that t. lecithinolyticum  may be a diagnostic marker for gap and c. ochracea for periodontal health. they also suggest that current presumptions of the association of specific bacteria with periodontal health and disease require further evaluation.

TI  == serum antibodies to periodontal bacteria as diagnostic markers of periodontitis.
AB  == background: assessment of periodontal conditions in epidemiologic studies usually requires a clinical examination, which is resource-intensive. we investigated the ability of serum immunoglobulin g (igg) antibodies to periodontal bacteria to reflect clinical periodontal status. methods: we used checkerboard immunoblotting to assess serum igg levels to 19 species, including established/putative periodontal pathogens and non-pathogenic bacteria, in 5,747 dentate adults aged > or = 40 years who participated in the third national health and nutrition examination survey between 1988 and 1994. three earlier described alternative definitions of periodontitis were used, based on specific combinations of probing depth and attachment level values. optimized elevated titer thresholds and corresponding sensitivities and specificities were calculated for each definition. titers significantly associated with periodontitis were identified in univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. parsimonious models were subsequently developed using age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, smoking, and diagnosed diabetes. results: in unadjusted models, high titers to porphyromonas gingivalis were most strongly associated with periodontitis across  all definitions (odds ratio, 2.07 to 2.74; p <0.05). in parsimonious models including demographic data, smoking, and diagnosed diabetes, high p. gingivalis titers were consistently associated with periodontitis, whereas high eubacterium  nodatum titers were associated with periodontal health in two of three definitions. receiver operating characteristic curves for the parsimonious multivariable models showed that the area under the curve ranged between 0.72 and 0.78. conclusions: serum igg titers to selected periodontal species, combined with demographic and behavioral characteristics, resulted in a moderately accurate classification of periodontal status in epidemiologic studies. the external validity of these findings must be examined further.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == tannerella forsythia and the hla-dqb1 allele are associated with susceptibility to periodontal disease in japanese adolescents.
AB  == periodontal disease is a multiple factor disease caused by genetic factors, environmental factors, and periodontal bacteria (periodontal pathogens). the present study aimed to elucidate the risk factors for periodontal disease in japanese adolescents. subjects (11-16 years old) were classified into three groups: localized aggressive periodontitis (lap), periodontal attachment loss (pal), and periodontally healthy (ph) groups. genomic dna isolated from the buccal mucosa was used for single-nucleotide polymorphism analyses of the candidate genes (interleukin-1alpha-889; interleukin-1alpha +4845; interleukin-1beta +3954; an immunoglobulin g fc gamma receptor, fcgammariia-r/h131; and a human leukocyte antigen class ii allele, hla-dqb1) of aggressive periodontitis. subgingival plaque samples obtained from the same subjects were used for 16s rrnabased polymerase chain reaction analysis of five important periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia). tannerella forsythia was detected in the deepest periodontal pockets in all subjects in the lap and pal groups. the prevalence of  an atypical bamhi restriction site in hla-dqb1 of the lap group was significantly higher than that in the ph and pal groups. furthermore, all subjects who had the  atypical bamhi restriction site in hla-dqb1 had t. forsythia infection. these results suggested that t. forsythia is associated with periodontal disease in japanese adolescents and also suggested that hla-dqb1 is related to lap and is associated with t. forsythia infection.

TI  == salivary detection of periodontopathic bacteria and periodontal health status in  dental students.
AB  == objective: saliva may become a potential source of contamination through vertical and horizontal transmissions as well as cross-infections. this study aims to use  saliva as a screening tool to detect putative periodontal pathogens in a young population with fairly good oral hygiene. materials and methods: stimulated saliva samples were obtained from 134 dental students (20.5+/-1 years, range 18-22 years). among those, 77 subjects also completed a periodontal examination including attachment loss, modified dental, gingival and plaque indices (al, mdi, gi and pi). the test bacteria were identified using a 16s rrna-based pcr detection method. results: one or more of the test bacteria was found in 67% of the subjects. prevotella nigrescens was detected as single bacterium in 16% of the subjects followed by treponema denticola (4%), porphyromonas gingivalis (2%), aggregatibacter (formerly actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans (1%) and tannerella forsythia (1%). two or more pathogens were detected in 42% of the subjects. clinical examination revealed health with no attachment loss (al) in 84% of the students. in no al group, 38% of the students were pathogen free while this was 25% for students in localized al group (p>0.05). there was a statistically significant association between the detection of salivary periodontal pathogen in general and higher pi (p=0.018) and gi (p=0.043). conclusion: within the limits of this study, it is possible to detect all six periodontal pathogens in the saliva of dental students. although a correlation can be observed between the presence of salivary periodontal pathogen and clinical signs of inflammation such as plaque accumulation and gingival bleeding, detection of specific bacteria in saliva is not related to the presence of localized al based on the presented study population.

TI  == periodontal pathogen levels in adolescents before, during, and after fixed orthodontic appliance therapy.
AB  == introduction: this purpose of this study was to document and investigate changes  in periodontal pathogen levels before, during, and after orthodontic treatment in adolescents. methods: dna gene probe analysis was used to quantify the levels of  8 periodontal pathogens before, during, and after treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances in 190 concurrently treated adolescent orthodontic patients. the 8 pathogens examined were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), tannerella forsythia (tf), eikenella corrodens (ec), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), treponema denticola (td), and campylobacter rectus (cr). chi-square tests were used to determine whether the percentages of subjects with high counts significantly changed over time. logistic regression analyses were also performed to derive the relative risk of higher counts of pathogenic bacteria with fixed appliances at the various time intervals studied. results: for 6 (pi, tf, ec, fn, td, cr) of the 8 pathogens, the percentages of subjects with high pathogen counts increased  significantly after 6 months of fixed appliance treatment, but these returned to  pretreatment levels by 12 months of orthodontic treatment. no pathogen level was  significantly higher after 12 months of orthodontic treatment, and orthodontic treatment was found to be significantly protective for half of the pathogens (ec, fn, td, cr) posttreatment. conclusions: orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances does not increase the risk of high levels of these periodontal pathogens.

TI  == detection of oral bacteria in cardiovascular specimens.
AB  == background/aims: oral bacteria, including cariogenic and periodontal pathogens, are thought to be etiological factors in the development of cardiovascular diseases. to define this relationship, we analyzed the distribution of oral bacterial species in cardiovascular specimens. method: following acceptance into  the study, 203 consecutive patients were analyzed, from whom 82 aortic valve specimens, 35 mitral valve specimens, and 86 aortic aneurysmal wall specimens, of which 16 contained aneurysmal thrombus tissues, were obtained. in addition, a total of 58 dental plaque specimens were collected from the same group of patients who underwent heart valve replacement or removal of aortic aneurysms. bacterial dna was extracted from both cardiovascular tissues and dental plaque in those cases and then species-specific polymerase chain reaction assays were used  to analyze the occurrences of six oral streptococcal and six periodontal bacterial species. results: streptococcus mutans was the most frequently detected species in the cardiovascular specimens, followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. as for dental plaque specimens from patients who underwent cardiovascular operations, most of the tested periodontitis-related species as well as oral streptococci were detected at high frequencies. furthermore, the positive rate of s. mutans in cardiovascular specimens from patients whose dental plaque specimens were also positive for s. mutans was 78%, which was significantly higher than any other tested species when the same analysis was performed. conclusion: our results suggest that specific oral bacterial species,  such as s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans, are related to bacteremia and may be etiologic factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases.

TI  == [identification of periodontopathogen microorganisms by pcr technique].
AB  == introduction: periodontitis is an inflammatory disease of the supporting tissues  of teeth and is a major cause of tooth loss in adults. the onset and progression  of periodontal disease is attributed to the presence of elevated levels of a consortium of pathogenic bacteria. gram negative bacteria, mainly strict anaerobes, play the major role. objective: the present study aimed to assess the  presence of the main types of microorganisms involved in the aetiopathogenesis of periodontal disease: porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, treponema denticola, tanerella forsythia and prevotella intermedia in different samples collected from the oral  cavity of 90 patients diagnosed with periodontitis. method: bacterial dna detection was performed in diverse biological materials, namely in dental plaque, gingival tissue and saliva, by means of multiplex pcr, a technique that allows simultaneous identification of two different bacterial genomes. results: in the dental plaque of the periodontitis patients, treponema denticola dominated. in the gingival tissue, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were the microbiota most frequently detected, whilst in saliva treponema denticola and eikenella corrodens were found with the highest percentage. conclusion: the identification of microorganisms by multiplex pcr is specific and sensitive. rapid and precise assessment of different types of periodontopathogens is extremely important for early detection of the infection and consequently for the prevention and treatment of periodontal disease. in everyday clinical practice, for routine bacterial evaluation in patients with periodontal disease, the dental plaque is the most suitable biological material, because it is the richest in periodontal bacteria.

TI  == persistence of extracrevicular bacterial reservoirs after treatment of aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that periodontal pathogens associated with aggressive periodontitis persist in extracrevicular locations following scaling and root planing, systemic antibiotics, and antimicrobial rinses. methods: eighteen patients with aggressive periodontitis received a clinical examination during which samples of subgingival plaque and buccal epithelial cells were obtained. treatment consisted of full-mouth root planing, systemic antibiotics, and chlorhexidine rinses. clinical measurements and sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. quantitative polymerase chain reaction determined the number of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola in the plaque. fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy determined the extent of intracellular invasion in epithelial cells. results: clinical measurements improved significantly following treatment. all bacterial species except p. gingivalis were significantly reduced in plaque between baseline and 3 months. however, all species showed a trend to repopulate  between 3 and 6 months. this increase was statistically significant for log t. denticola counts. all species were detected intracellularly. the percentage of cells infected intracellularly was not affected by therapy. conclusions: the 6-month increasing trend in the levels of plaque bacteria suggests that subgingival recolonization was occurring. because the presence of these species within epithelial cells was not altered after treatment, it is plausible that recolonization may occur from the oral mucosa. systemic antibiotics and topical chlorhexidine did not reduce the percentage of invaded epithelial cells. these data support the hypothesis that extracrevicular reservoirs of bacteria exist, which might contribute to recurrent or refractory disease in some patients.

TI  == granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (gcp-2/cxcl6) complements interleukin-8 in periodontal disease.
AB  == background and objective: mucosal inflammatory responses are orchestrated largely by pro-inflammatory chemokines. the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (cxcl6) is involved in neutrophil recruitment and migration. previous studies have shown that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 is up-regulated during mucosal  inflammation (e.g. in inflammatory bowel disease), similarly to the functionally  and structurally related chemokine interleukin-8. nevertheless, unlike interleukin-8, a role of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival inflammation has not been yet demonstrated. in this study we aimed to evaluate the expression of the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in clinically healthy vs. diseased gingival tissues and to explore possible correlations with clinical and microbiological markers of periodontitis. material and methods: gene expression in 184 'diseased' and 63 'healthy' gingival tissue specimens from 90 patients with periodontitis was analyzed using affymetrix u133plus2.0 arrays. the expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was further confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while the localization of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival tissues was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. plaque samples from the adjacent periodontal pockets were collected and evaluated for 11 species of periodontal bacteria using checkerboard dna-dna hybridizations. results: among all known chemokines, gcp-2 expression was the most up-regulated (3.8-fold, p < 1.1 x 10(-16)), in 'diseased' vs. 'healthy' tissue as compared to  a 2.6-fold increased expression of interleukin-8 mrna (p < 1.2 x 10(-15)). increased expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlated with higher  levels of 'red' and 'orange' complex pathogens and with increased probing depth,  but not with attachment loss. immunohistochemistry showed that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was expressed in gingival vascular endothelium. conclusion: the level of expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlates with the  severity of periodontitis and appears to act as a hitherto unrecognized functional adjunct to interleukin-8 in diseased gingival tissues.

TI  == periodontal bacterial profiles in pregnant women: response to treatment and associations with birth outcomes in the obstetrics and periodontal therapy (opt)  study.
AB  == background: a recent clinical trial (obstetrics and periodontal therapy [opt] study) demonstrated that periodontal therapy during pregnancy improved periodontal outcomes but failed to impact preterm birth. the present study evaluated seven target bacteria, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, and fusobacterium nucleatum, in subgingival dental plaque of pregnant women in the opt study and their association with birth outcomes. methods: pregnant women were randomly assigned to receive periodontal treatment before 21 weeks' gestation or after delivery. subgingival plaque was sampled at baseline (13 to 16 weeks; 6 days of gestation)  and at 29 to 32 weeks. we analyzed subgingival plaque samples from women who experienced fetal loss, delivered a live preterm infant (preterm women), or delivered a full-term infant (full-term women). samples were analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. associations between preterm birth and bacterial counts and percentages were tested using multiple linear regression. results: no significant differences were observed at baseline between preterm and full-term women for any measured bacterial species or group of species, after accounting for multiple comparisons. changes in bacterial counts and proportions  during pregnancy also were not associated with birth outcomes. in full-term and preterm women, periodontal therapy significantly reduced (p <0.01) counts of all  target species except for a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusions: in pregnant women with periodontitis, non-surgical periodontal therapy significantly reduced  levels of periodontal pathogens. baseline levels of selected periodontal pathogens or changes in these bacteria resulting from therapy were not associated with preterm birth.

TI  == photodynamic therapy as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
AB  == background: recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested a potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (pdt) in the treatment of periodontitis. however, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of pdt in the treatment of periodontitis. the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiologic effects of the adjunctive use of pdt to non-surgical periodontal treatment. methods: twenty-four subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomly treated with scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of pdt (test) or scaling and root planing alone (control). full-mouth plaque score (fmps), full-mouth bleeding score (fmbs), probing depth (pd), gingival recession, and clinical attachment level (cal) were measured at baseline and 3 and 6 months after therapy. primary outcome variables were changes in pd and cal. microbiologic evaluation of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), treponema denticola, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium nodatum, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga spp. was performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months following therapy by using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. results: at 3 and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups with regard to cal, pd,  fmps, or microbiologic changes. at 3 and 6 months, a statistically significantly  greater improvement in fmbs was found in the test group. conclusion: the additional application of a single episode of pdt to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of pd reduction and cal gain, but it resulted in a significantly higher reduction in bleeding scores compared to scaling and root planing alone.

AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to assess the effects of dental flossing on the microbial composition of interproximal plaque samples in matched  twins. methods: the study was a two-treatment, examiner-masked, randomized, parallel-group, controlled study. fifty-one twin pairs between 12 and 21 years of age were randomized to a 2-week supervised and unsupervised treatment regimen consisting of tongue brushing and toothbrushing or tongue brushing and toothbrushing plus flossing. the reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay was used to assess levels (abundance) of 26 microbial species in interproximal plaque samples collected from six sites per subject. an integrative computational predictive model estimated average changes in microbial abundance patterns of selected bacterial species from baseline to 2 weeks by comparing treatment groups. results: after the 2-week study period, putative periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria were overabundant in the group that did not floss compared to the group that performed flossing. those included treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and streptococcus mutans. microbial species that are not consistent with the development of periodontal disease or dental caries were overabundant in the group that did floss compared to the non-flossing group. conclusion: in a well-matched twin cohort, tooth and tongue brushing plus flossing significantly decreased the abundance of microbial  species associated with periodontal disease and dental caries after a 2-week program.

TI  == third molars and the efficacy of mechanical debridement in reducing pathogen levels in pregnant subjects: a pilot study.
AB  == purpose: to assess the impact of mechanical debridement (scaling and root planing), without adjunctive therapy, on reducing the numbers of periodontal pathogens detected in pregnant subjects with and without visible third molars. patients and methods: sixty-seven subjects in the second trimester of pregnancy were enrolled in an institutional review board-approved study. full mouth periodontal exams of all teeth were conducted at baseline and postpartum. presence or absence of third molars was noted. subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from the mesiobuccal of all first molars at enrollment and postpartum. subjects' total counts for periodontal pathogens in biofilm samples were determined by dna-dna checkerboard hybridization. we analyzed data from a subsample of 26 subjects. all subjects in the study were treated at enrollment by mechanical debridement of all teeth, including third molars. differences between  subjects' baseline and postpartum demographic and clinical characteristics were analyzed by chi(2) and t tests by presence or absence of third molars. statistical significance for differences in pathogen levels was determined by rank analysis of covariance. significance was set at 0.05 without correction for  multiple comparisons. results: most of the 26 subjects were african american (61%), on medicaid (92%), and did not smoke during pregnancy (88%). the 15 subjects with visible third molars were significantly older (28.0 years [sd 6.4]  vs 23.7 years [sd 3.9]). in the 11 subjects with no third molars noted, all pathogen counts were reduced postpartum. in the 15 subjects with visible third molars, total counts for each pathogen analyzed were higher postpartum as compared with subjects with no visible third molars, and their bacterial counts were increased for 5 of the 8 pathogens, including all "red cluster" pathogens. differences between study groups were observed by the presence or absence of third molars for t. forsythia and p. nigrescens (p = .04), and for p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, total "orange cluster" bacteria, and total pathogens (p < .06). conclusion: the efficacy of mechanical debridement to lower periodontal pathogen  counts during pregnancy was limited by the presence of visible third molars and should be analyzed further in larger scale trials.

AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to assess the relationship between serum  glycemic levels and subgingival microbial profile alteration following periodontal treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. methods: we studied 30 periodontitis patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who received full-mouth subgingival debridement by analyzing their subgingival microbial profiles using a polymerase chain reaction method at baseline and various time-points for 12 months following treatment. concurrently, probing pocket depth, bleeding on probing, and metabolic parameters, including glycated hemoglobin a1c (hba1c), blood sugar level, c-reactive proteins, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and high-density and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, were recorded. results: periodontal conditions were significantly improved after treatment, and the occurrence rates of periodontal bacterial species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia, were also reduced. interestingly, p. gingivalis was detected more frequently in subjects with increased hba1c values after periodontal treatment than in those patients with decreased hba1c values. furthermore, p. gingivalis with type ii fimbriae was detected only in hba1c-increased subjects, while improvements in hba1c values were observed only in subjects without type ii clones. conclusions: these results suggest that glycemic level in diabetes is affected by the persistence of p. gingivalis, especially clones with type ii fimbriae, in periodontal pockets.

TI  == analysis of neutrophil-derived antimicrobial peptides in gingival crevicular fluid suggests importance of cathelicidin ll-37 in the innate immune response against periodontogenic bacteria.
AB  == introduction: during periodontitis, an innate immune response to bacterial challenge is primarily mediated by neutrophils. we compared neutrophilic content  and the level of neutrophil-derived antimicrobial peptides in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) in two clinical forms of severe periodontitis. methods: gcf was collected from 14 patients with aggressive periodontitis, 17 patients with chronic periodontitis, and nine healthy subjects. samples were analyzed for periodontopathogen load using real-time polymerase chain reactions. the amounts of myeloperoxidase and alpha-defensins (hnp1-3) were determined by enzyme-linked  immunosorbent assay, and the level of cathelicidin (hcap18/ll-37) was assayed by  western blot. results: myeloperoxidase concentration was not correlated with levels of ll-37 and hnp1-3 in samples from patients, compared to controls. the amount of hnp1-3 was twofold and fourfold higher in patients with aggressive and  chronic periodontitis, respectively. those with chronic disease had significantly elevated amounts of mature ll-37. the increased concentration of both peptides in chronic periodontitis correlated with the load of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. conclusion: the lack of a correlation between ll-37, hnp1-3, and myeloperoxidase content suggests that neutrophils are not the sole source of these bactericidal peptides in the gcf of  patients with periodontitis; and that other cells contribute to their local production. the bacterial proteases of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola might degrade hcap18/ll-37, because the 11-kda cathelicidin-derived fragment was present in gcf collected from pockets infected with these bacteria.  collectively, it appears that a local deficiency in ll-37 can be considered as a  supporting factor in the pathogenesis of severe cases of periodontitis.

TI  == rapid and simple detection of eight major periodontal pathogens by the loop-mediated isothermal amplification method.
AB  == loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) was applied to develop a rapid and  simple detection system for eight periodontal pathogens: aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia. primers were designed from the 16s ribosomal rna gene for each pathogen, and the lamp amplified the targets specifically and efficiently under isothermal condition at 64 degrees c.  to simplify the manipulation of lamp examination, boiled cells and intact cells suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) were tested as templates besides extracted dna template. the detection limits were 1-10 cells per tube using extracted dna template. however, lamp methods using boiled cells and intact cells required 10-100 and 100-1000 cells per tube, respectively. lamps for a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and p. intermedia were then applied to clinical plaque samples, and the method demonstrated equal or higher sensitivity  compared with the conventional real-time pcr method. these findings suggest the usefulness of the lamp method for the rapid and simple microbiological diagnosis  of periodontitis, and the possibility of lamp examination without the dna extraction step.

AB  == objective: to evaluate the prevalence rates of human cytomegalovirus(hcmv) and epstein-barr virus-1(ebv-1) in subgingival plaque and analyze the relationship between herpesviruses, periodontal pathogenic bacteria and periodontal clinical parameters in chinese patients with aggressive periodontitis(agp). methods: a total of one hundred and twenty subgingival plaque samples were collected from 89 agp patients and 31 healthy subjects. hcmv and ebv-1 were detected using nested polymerase chain reaction(pcr).contemporaneously, 8 periodontal pathogenic bacteria including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans(aa), porphyromonas gingivalis(pg), tannerella forsythensis(tf), prevotella intermedia(pi), campylobacter rectus(cr),fusobacterium nucleatum(fn), treponema denticola(td), prevotella nigrescens(pn) were detected by 16s rrna based pcr. results: hcmv was  more frequently detected in agp patients (43.8%) than in healthy controls (12.9%, p<0.01). the prevalence rates of hcmv and ebv-1 in agp patients with 6-8 kinds of bacteria detected were 54.4% and 17.4%, respectively, significantly higher than those with 3-5 kinds of bacteria detected (p<0.05). conclusion: the prevalence rates of hcmv and ebv was higher in agp patients than in healthy controls. herpesviruses and periodontal pathogenic bacteria may cooperate synergistically in the development of agp, which could be considered as a pathogenetic consortium in future investigation of periodontaltitis.

TI  == photodynamic therapy as adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment in patients on periodontal maintenance: a randomized controlled clinical trial.
AB  == recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested the potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (pdt) in the treatment of periodontitis. however, currently, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of pdt in the treatment of periodontitis. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of the adjunctive use of pdt in non-surgical periodontal treatment in patients receiving supportive periodontal therapy. twenty-four patients receiving regularly supportive periodontal therapy  were randomly treated with either subgingival scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of pdt (test) or subgingival scaling and root planing alone (control). the following parameters were evaluated at baseline and at 3 months and 6 months after therapy: full mouth plaque score (fmps), full mouth bleeding score (fmbs), bleeding on probing (bop) at experimental sites, probing pocket depth (ppd), gingival recession (rec), and clinical attachment level (cal). primary outcome variables were changes in ppd and cal. microbiological evaluation of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.), prevotella intermedia (p.i.), tannerella forsythensis (t.f.), treponema denticola (t.d.), peptostreptococcus micros (p.m.), fusobacterium nucleatum (f.n.), campylobacter rectus (c.r.), eubacterium nodatum (e.n.), eikenella corrodens (e.c.), and capnocytophaga species (c.s.) was also performed at baseline and at 3 months and 6 months after therapy, using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. no differences in any of the investigated parameters were observed at baseline between the two groups. at 3 months and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of ppd, cal and fmps. at 3 months and 6 months, a statistically significantly higher improvement of bop was found in the test group. at 3 months  after therapy, the microbiological analysis showed a statistically significant reduction of f.n. and e.n. in the test group. at 6 months, statistically significantly higher numbers of e.c. and c.s. were detected in the test group. the additional application of a single episode of pdt to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of ppd reduction and cal gain, but it resulted in significantly higher reduction of bleeding scores than following scaling and root planing alone.

TI  == comparative analysis of putative periodontopathic bacteria by multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background and objective: the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) has been applied for the rapid and specific detection of periodontopathic bacteria in subgingival  plaque and is potentially of clinical benefit in the diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis subjects. however, several technical points need to be modified before the conventional pcr detection system can be used by clinicians. material  and methods: to develop a pcr-based technique more applicable for clinical use than conventional pcr, we established a multiplex pcr for five putative periodontopathic (treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter  actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythia) and two nonperiodontopathic (streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus salivarius) species of bacteria using whole-plaque suspension as templates, and detected bacteria in subgingival plaque taken from 85 subjects at the supportive periodontal therapy stage after active periodontal treatments. results: among putative periodontopathic bacteria, the detection frequency of t. denticola and p. gingivalis was elevated in parallel with higher probing pocket depth and clinical attachment loss, and had 4.2-14.1 times increasing odds of the clinical  parameters tested. detection of any of the five species of putative periodontopathic bacteria markedly increased the odds ratio of a higher probing pocket depth, clinical attachment loss and bleeding on probing. conclusion: the multiplex pcr system developed in this study enabled the detection of all the bacteria under investigation in one reaction tube in a less time- and labor-intensive manner than conventional pcr. these results support the potential clinical use of multiplex pcr for detecting periodontopathic bacteria and for evaluating therapeutic strategies and predicting the prognosis for each subject.

TI  == bleeding on probing differentially relates to bacterial profiles: the oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study.
AB  == aim: various bacterial species are differentially prevalent in periodontal health, gingivitis or periodontitis. we tested the independent associations between three bacterial groupings and gingival inflammation in an epidemiological study. material and methods: in 706 oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study (invest) participants > or =55 years, bleeding on probing (bop), pocket depth (pd) and subgingival plaque samples (n=4866) were assessed in eight sites per mouth. eleven bacterial species were quantitatively assayed and grouped as follows: (i) aetiologic burden (eb, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella  forsythia); (ii) putative burden (pb, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens,  fusobacterium nucleatum, micromonas micros, prevotella intermedia); (iii) health-associated burden (hab, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula). results: after mutual adjustment for eb, pb and hab, the bop prevalence increased by 45% ( p<0.0001) across increasing quartiles of eb while bop decreased by 13% ( p<0.0001) across increasing quartiles of hab. mean pd increased 0.8 mm and decreased 0.3 mm from the first to fourth quartiles of eb (p<0.0001) and hab ( p<0.0001), respectively. among 1214 plaque samples with fourth quartile eb, 60% were collected from sites with pd < or =3 mm. conclusion: bacterial species believed to be aetiologically related to periodontitis were associated with bop in sites with minimal pd and/or attachment level (al). species presumed to be associated with periodontal health demonstrated inverse associations with bop.

TI  == microbiologic and immunologic characteristics of periodontal disease in hispanic  americans with type 2 diabetes.
AB  == background: the microbiology of periodontitis in type 1 diabetes has been reported, but less is known about type 2 diabetes. moreover, these data have not  linked microbial colonization, host response, and clinical presentation in type 1 or type 2 diabetes. the objectives of this study were to relate periodontal status, periodontal microorganisms, and host-response characteristics in hispanic americans with type 2 diabetes. methods: plaque and serum samples were obtained from 63 hispanic american subjects with and without type 2 diabetes. the microbiology of subgingival plaque samples was evaluated using dna checkerboard hybridization, and serum antibody to a battery of oral microorganisms was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: in general, similar pathogens were present in periodontitis sites from subjects with and without type 2 diabetes, although the periodontitis sites in diabetes showed a higher frequency of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and campylobacter spp. serum antibody to campylobacter rectus was elevated in type 2  diabetes, whereas antibody to p. gingivalis and c. rectus were elevated in subjects with periodontitis, irrespective of diabetes status. stratification of the population based upon antibody to p. gingivalis or c. rectus suggested a linkage between elevated antibody to p. gingivalis, increased frequency of diabetes, and significantly worse periodontitis. conclusion: the increased severity of periodontal disease with type 2 diabetes may reflect an alteration of the pathogenic potential of periodontal bacteria and/or a modification of the characteristics of the host's inflammatory response that may contribute to a breakdown in the homeostasis of the periodontium.

TI  == high incidence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans infection in acute coronary syndrome.
AB  == recent epidemiological studies suggest that periodontitis is an important risk factor for coronary heart disease (chd). the aim of this study was to evaluate the association between periodontitis and chd, particularly acute coronary syndrome (acs), focusing on microbiological and immunological features. twenty-eight chd patients, 15 with acs and 13 with chronic chd, were included in  this study. coronary angiography, periodontal examination, and dental radiography were performed in all patients. subgingival plaque, saliva, and blood samples were analyzed for the periodontopathogens actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia using polymerase chain reaction. specific serum antibody titers to the 5 periodontal pathogens were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. it was found that 33% of the acs patients (5/15) harbored a. actinomycetemcomitans in oral samples, whereas no a. actinomycetemcomitans (0/13) was found in the chronic chd patients (p < 0.05). furthermore, acs patients showed significantly higher serum igg titers to a. actinomycetemcomitans (p < 0.05) compared with chronic chd. more tooth loss and alveolar bone loss were noted in acs patients than in chronic chd patients, although the differences were not statistically significant. periodontal pathogens, particularly a. actinomycetemcomitans, may play a role in the development of acs.

TI  == implant surface analysis and microbiologic evaluation of failed implants retrieved from smokers.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the microbiota and surface of failed titanium dental implants from 4 manufacturers. twelve mobile dental implants were retrieved from 10 smokers after 3 to 10 years of functional loading. before implant removal, microbial samples were taken and evaluated using polymerase chain reaction. after implant removal, analyses of the failed implant surfaces were performed using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectrometer x-ray. periodontal pathogens such as aggregactibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were detected in all implants in different proportions. surface analysis showed varying degrees of surface roughness between the samples  and the presence of proteinaceous material, appearing mainly as dark stains. foreign carbon, oxygen, sodium, calcium, aluminum, and silicon elements were also found. although no material-related causes of implant failure were detected, several periodontal pathogens were identified independently of the surface topography or manufacturer.

TI  == salivary detection of periodontopathic bacteria in periodontally healthy children.
AB  == background: salivary occurrence of periodontopathic bacteria is of interest especially in children as a risk indicator for the transmission, development and  control of periodontal disease. we assessed the prevalence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola as microbial complexes  in the saliva of children with mixed dentition and healthy gingiva. materials and methods: paraffin-stimulated saliva samples were collected from 41 children (22 boys and 19 girls), aged 6-13 years old. gingival health was determined during the initial screening exam. the test bacteria were identified using a 16s rrna-based pcr analysis. results: p. nigrescens was the most frequent species (80%), followed by t. denticola (32%), a. actinomycetemcomitans (24%) and p. gingivalis (12%). p. intermedia and t. forsythia were not detected. p. nigrescens was also common species in combinations. paired and triple bacterial combinations were found in 24% and 20% of all children, respectively. there was no positive association between bacterial combinations in colonization and subject's gender (p>0.05, fisher exact test). conclusion: the salivary presence of p. nigrescens,  t. denticola, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis but not p. intermedia and t. forsythia can occur in childhood without clinical signs of gingival disease. thus, the possible risk of bacterial transmissions through saliva and, the need to screen for periodontal pathogens should be considered before mixed dentition.

TI  == microbiologic analysis of periodontal pockets and carotid atheromatous plaques in advanced chronic periodontitis patients.
AB  == background: in recent years, many researchers have focused their attention on the ability of periodontal pathogens to colonize atheromatous plaques. nevertheless,  a clear correlation between the detection rates of periodontopathic bacterial dna in atheromas and in subgingival plaque samples has not been established. the aim  of our study was to assess the presence of five periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia [formerly tannerella forsythensis]) in periodontal pockets and in carotid atheromas recovered from the same patients. methods: thirty-three patients with advanced chronic periodontitis scheduled for endarterectomy were enrolled in the study. dna was extracted from subgingival plaque samples and carotid atheromas. universal bacteria primers for  general detection of bacteria and species-specific primers for detection of periodontal pathogens were used to amplify part of the 16s rrna gene by polymerase chain reaction. results: all subgingival plaque samples were positive  for at least one target microorganism. the prevalence of t. forsythia, p. gingivalis, t. denticola, p. intermedia, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were 69.7%, 63.6%, 54.5%, 45.4%, and 33.3%, respectively. bacterial dna was detected in 31 out of 33 endarterectomy specimens. however, none of the samples tested positive  for dna from periodontal pathogens. conclusion: the presence of periodontal bacteria in atheromatous plaques was not confirmed by this investigation; thus, no correlation could be drawn between periodontitis bacteria and microorganisms involved in the atherosclerotic lesions.

AB  == our 10-year study of early-onset periodontitis (eop) patients includes repeated clinical observations, microbiological characteristics and analysis of genetic polymorphism of il-1a and il-1b genes. twenty patients (age 15-26 years) were divided according to the clinical status in the 4th year into a group with mean number of teeth with bleeding on probing (bp) 9.8 and mean number of teeth with periodontal pocket (pp) 2.23, and a group with mean number of teeth with bp 5.37  and no pp. significantly higher values of mean bp and pp were found among the groups during the study but a strong progression of disease was found only in 3 patients. the risk il-1a allele-2 and il-1b allele-2 genotype and bacterial presence were analyzed by dna hybridization methods. no significant differences of bacteria composition (treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) were found between the groups. a higher prevalence of composite il-1 genotype was detected in the group of eop patients with progressive disease. early finding of the disease followed by conservative therapy could positively influence the disease progression. eop treated in early  stages may, but need not, develop into the aggressive form in the presence of risk genotype il-1.

TI  == population-based study of salivary carriage of periodontal pathogens in adults.
AB  == large, general population-based data on carriage rates of periodontal pathogens hardly exist in the current literature. the objectives of the present study were  to examine the salivary detection of aggregatibacter (formerly actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis, and treponema denticola in a representative  sample of the adult population living in southern finland and to clarify which determinants are associated with the presence of these pathogens in saliva. 16s rrna-based pcr methods with species-specific primers were employed to determine the presence of the six target bacteria in stimulated saliva samples, which were  available from 1,294 subjects aged > or =30 years. the age group, gender, level of education, marital status, smoking history, number of teeth, and number of teeth with deepened pockets were included in the statistical analysis. in general, the carriage of periodontal pathogens was common, since at least one of  the examined pathogens was found in 88.2% of the subjects. in descending order, the total detection rates were 56.9%, 38.2%, 35.4%, 31.3%, 20.0%, and 13.9% for t. forsythensis, t. denticola, p. gingivalis, c. rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. intermedia, respectively. age per se was strongly associated with the carriage of p. gingivalis (p = 0.000), and the level of education with that of t. denticola (p = 0.000). there was an association between the number of teeth with deepened pockets and carriage of p. gingivalis (p = 0.000), p. intermedia (p = 0.000), t. denticola (p = 0.000), and a. actinomycetemcomitans (p = 0.004). the data suggest that distinct species have a  different carriage profile, depending on variables such as age, educational level, and periodontal status.

TI  == herpesviral-bacterial synergy in the pathogenesis of human periodontitis.
AB  == purpose of review: periodontitis is an infectious disease, but the specific mechanisms by which tooth-supportive tissues are lost remain obscure. this article proposes an infectious disease model for periodontitis in which herpesviral-bacterial interactions assume a major etiopathogenic role. recent findings: epstein-barr virus type 1, cytomegalovirus and other herpesviruses occur at a high frequency in aggressive periodontitis lesions. also, herpesvirus-infected periodontitis lesions tend to harbor elevated levels of classic periodontopathic bacteria, including porphyromonas gingivalis, dialister  pneumosintes, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, treponema denticola and actinobacillus (aggregatibacter) actinomycetemcomitans. summary: conceivably, a herpesvirus active infection in the periodontium impairs  local defenses, thereby permitting overgrowth and increased aggressiveness of periodontopathic bacteria. in turn, periodontal pathogenic bacteria may augment the virulence of periodontal herpesviruses. it is suggested that interactions among herpesviruses and specific bacterial species constitute an important pathogenetic feature of periodontitis and maybe also of various non-oral infections.

AB  == aim: in the last years the relationship between periodontitis and cardiovascular  diseases has been a subject of increasing research. the identification of periodontopathic bacteria in atheromas can contribute to our knowledge of such an association. the aim of our study was to assess the concomitant presence of 5 periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia) in periodontal pockets and in carotid atheromas recovered from the same individuals. methods: twenty-one patients with chronic periodontitis scheduled for endarterectomy for carotid stenosis were enrolled in the study. subgingival plaque samples and carotid atheromas were examined using the polymerase chain reaction and reverse hybridization techniques by means of specific probes for periodontal bacteria. human beta-globin amplification was used as internal polymerase chain reaction efficiency control. results: three patients were excluded because the endarterectomy specimens were negative to dna  amplification. all subgingival plaque samples were positive for at least one target micro-organism. the prevalence of tannerella forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was 72.22%, 61.11%, 55.56%, 50%, and 33.33%, respectively.  no periodontal bacteria dna was detected in any endarterectomy specimen. conclusions: the presence of periodontal bacteria in atheromatous plaques was not confirmed by this investigation and, thus, no correlation between periodontitis bacteria and micro-organisms involved in the atherosclerotic lesions could be drawn.

AB  == background: recently, the clinical additive value of a highly concentrated chlorhexidine (chx) varnish, when applied subgingivally as an adjunct to scaling  and root planing, was described. the objective of the present study was to investigate the microbiological impact of a treatment strategy for chronic periodontitis based on a combination of same-day full-mouth root planing and subgingival chx varnish administration. methods: a randomized, controlled, single-blind, parallel trial was conducted on 33 non-smoking chronic periodontitis patients. the control group received oral hygiene instructions and  same-day full-mouth root planing. the test group received the same instructions and treatment; however, all pockets also were disinfected using a supersaturated  chx varnish. subgingival plaque samples were collected from the deepest site per  quadrant in each patient at baseline and after 1, 3, and 6 months. pooled sample  analysis was performed using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based method for the identification of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythensis (tf), treponema denticola  (td), and prevotella intermedia (pi). results: in terms of detection frequency and bacterial levels, significant, mainly temporary, reductions from baseline were found in both groups. when a comparison was made between the control and the test group, significant differences in the detection frequency of tf (p = 0.024)  and td (p = 0.024), which favored the test group, were found at 1 month. a similar phenomenon was seen for td (p = 0.031) based on bacterial levels. an important trend toward lower tf levels in the test group also was found at 1 month (p = 0.052). compared to baseline levels, microbiological benefits in the test group seemed to be maintained, at least in part, over a 6-month period. in contrast, all microbial levels had relapsed in the control group at study termination. conclusion: the microbiological results of the present study promote the subgingival administration of a highly concentrated chx varnish as an adjunct to same-day full-mouth root planing.

TI  == microbiological outcomes of quadrant versus full-mouth root planing as monitored  by real-time pcr.
AB  == objectives: to study the short-term microbiological changes following full-mouth  compared with quadrant wise scaling and root planing (fmrp and qrp) as well as long-term effects. method: twenty patients with chronic periodontitis were randomized into a test group treated in two sessions with subgingival scaling and root planing within 24 h (fmrp) and a control group treated quadrant by quadrant  in four sessions at intervals of one week (qrp). microbiological samples were taken in the two deepest pockets of the maxillary right quadrant immediately before treatment and after 1 day, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks. the samples were  evaluated by real-time pcr for quantification of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp., porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia as well as for total bacterial counts (tbc). results: treatment resulted in a tbc median log reduction of 0.75 (fmrp) and 0.72 (qrp). there were no differences between groups either for the short term (1 day-4 weeks) (analysis of variance: p=0.3150) or for long term (4-24 weeks) (analysis of variance: p=0.9671). likewise, no differences were detected for selected target bacteria. conclusion: the results of the present study showed similar microbiological outcomes following both treatment modalities.

TI  == identification of the microorganisms responsible for periodontopathy by multiplex rt-pcr.
AB  == the aim of our research was to identify by bacterial genomic dna analysis the prevalence of five different species of periodontopathogenic bacteria present in  the subgingival biofilm, specifically: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), bacterioides forsytus  (bf), treponema denticola (td). for the analysis we used the systematic multiplex-pcr-microdent kit with species-specific primers. we studied a group of  48 subjects, 18 males and 30 females, from 18 to 78 years of age. the initial clinical screening enabled us to select, among the group analysed, 24 subjects with signs of active periodontopathy (group a) and 24 patients without identifiable clinical evidence of the disease used as the control group (group b). within the two experimental groups (a and b), the test was found to be positive in 75% of subjects from group a, whereas the test was found to be negative in all the subjects from group b. our research shows that the multiplex-pcr system is reliable. furthermore, the sensitivity and simplicity of  this technique, as well as the decrease in working times and the possibility of identifying non-culturable bacteria, since the presence of viable organisms is not essential, make this technique indicated for the simultaneous identification  of periodontopathogenic bacteria and might, in perspective, provide a more effective clinical alternative to the techniques of bacterial typing of the subgingival plaque.

TI  == elevated igg titers to periodontal pathogens related to buerger disease.
AB  == background: periodontal pathogens were frequently detected in the occluded arteries of buerger disease patients, hence we hypothesized that the infection from periodontal pathogens may be associated with buerger disease. methods: we investigated periodontal status using various clinical parameters and serum igg antibody levels against t. denticola, p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. intermedia in nineteen buerger disease patients and fifteen control subjects.  the results were statistically analyzed. results: the prevalence of periodontitis and the percentages of probing sites with pd> or =4 mm and cal> or =4 mm were significantly higher in the patient group (p<0.001, p=0.016, and p<0.001, respectively). patients had significantly higher serum igg titers against t. denticola, p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans (p=0.002, p=0.039, and p=0.011, respectively). conclusions: this study provides evidence for possible implications of periodontitis in buerger disease.

TI  == carpegen real-time polymerase chain reaction vs. anaerobic culture for periodontal pathogen identification.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to compare two methods of microbiological diagnosis, anaerobic bacterial culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr), for the detection of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and treponema denticola. methods: seventy-two samples were collected from 18 patients who were suffering from aggressive periodontitis. the data obtained were compared for the two methods. results: the results obtained with real-time pcr were different from those obtained with bacterial culture. the detection differences were 3% for a. actinomycetemcomitans, 8.33% for p. intermedia, and 12.5% for f. nucleatum. however, the differences for p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were 51.39% and 36.11%, respectively. no comparison was possible for t. denticola because it cannot be identified in culture. the variations found were the result of the better detection level (10(2) pathogens)  of the pcr probe. unlike bacterial culture, pcr allows the detection of t. denticola, which does not forming colonies and is oxygen sensitive. for f. nucleatum, t. forsythia and p. gingivalis, the real-time pcr technique was more sensitive than culture. conclusion: good results were obtained with the real-time pcr technique for the six periopathogens targeted. this method seems to be indicated for its simplicity, rapidity and reproducibility but it cannot analyze  data for an antibiotic susceptibility test. the periodontist must therefore choose one of these two methods according to his specific clinical objective: to  obtain rapid, specific detection even with weak initial concentrations (but for targeted periopathogens only) or to be non-specific and analyze the pathological  activity with an antibiogram.

TI  == antibacterial effect of electrolyzed water on oral bacteria.
AB  == this study investigated the antibacterial effect of electrolyzed water on oral bacteria both in vitro and in vivo. tap water was electrolyzed in a water vessel  using platinum cell technology. the electrolyzed tap water (called puri-water) was put in contact with five major periodontopathogens or toothbrushes contaminated with these bacteria for 30 sec. in addition, puri-water was used as  a mouthwash for 30 sec in 16 subjects and the antibacterial effect on salivary bacteria was evaluated. puri-water significantly reduced the growth of all periodontopathogens in culture and on toothbrushes, and that of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in saliva, when compared to the effect of tap water. it also significantly reduced mutans streptococci growing on mitis salivarius-bacitracin  agar. our results demonstrate that the electrolyzed tap water is effective as a mouthwash and for toothbrush disinfection.

TI  == antibody response after single-visit full-mouth ultrasonic debridement versus quadrant-wise therapy.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to compare serum antibody responses to periodontal pathogens after single-visit full-mouth ultrasonic debridement and quadrant-wise therapy. material and methods: thirty-six subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomized into three groups: quadrant-wise debridement in four visits, one-visit full-mouth debridement with water and with povidone iodine. blood samples were collected before and immediately after treatment and 1, 3 and 6 months post-therapy. serum antibody titres and avidity to porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and thiocyanate elisa, respectively. results: igg titres to p. gingivalis significantly decreased at 1, 3 and 6 months in full-mouth debridement with water group, while significant reductions were seen only at 3 and 6 months after quadrant-wise debridement. both full-mouth groups showed significant reduction in igg titres to a. actinomycetemcomitans at 3 and 6 months. significant increases in antibody avidity to p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans were noted 3 months following full-mouth debridement with povidone. conclusion: both full-mouth and quadrant treatments generally resulted  in a decrease in antibody titres and increase in antibody avidity. full-mouth debridement induced an earlier reduction of igg titre to p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans, than quadrant-wise therapy.

TI  == langerhans' cell histiocytosis in a 5-year-old girl: evidence of periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: langerhans' cell histiocytosis (lch) is a rare disorder characterized by langerhans' cell proliferation in various organs or tissues. when periodontal  tissue is involved, clinical manifestations can vary from gingival recession and  pocket formation to severe alveolar bone loss. this case report describes periodontal pathogens found in the pockets of involved primary teeth. methods: a  5-year-old girl with lch presented with loose teeth. intraoral examination and radiographs revealed deep pockets and severe bone loss around all primary molars. bacterial samples were obtained from saliva and subgingival plaque and analyzed for the presence of five periodontopathic bacteria using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. due to severe periodontal destruction, all primary molars  were extracted, and a gingival biopsy was taken from tooth t to confirm the diagnosis of lch. results: the biopsy specimen revealed the histologic features of lch. the patient was diagnosed as having periodontitis as a manifestation of lch. pcr results of subgingival plaque from lch-affected molars indicated the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia. however, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was absent from these teeth. no tested bacteria were found  in the non-affected anterior teeth. conclusions: the bacteria commonly associated with periodontal disease were detected in subgingival plaque samples from this lch patient. more microbiological data are required to understand the role of these bacteria in lch-associated periodontal destruction.

TI  == relationship of serum advanced glycation end products with deterioration of periodontitis in type 2 diabetes patients.
AB  == background: a close relationship between diabetes and chronic periodontitis has been demonstrated. we previously found that porphyromonas gingivalis with the type ii fima gene is an infectious factor closely associated with the deterioration seen in diabetic periodontitis patients. in the present study, we examined whether other biomarkers are related to the development and deterioration of periodontitis often seen in type 2 diabetic individuals. methods: a total of 97 type 2 diabetes patients with and without periodontitis were recruited, and their periodontal and diabetic conditions were analyzed. the  ratio (%) of teeth with an attachment loss >5 mm among all teeth in each subject  was used as an index of periodontal deterioration. peripheral blood was tested for levels of glycated hemoglobin (hba1c), advanced glycation end products (ages), c-reactive protein (crp), and cytokines (tumor necrosis factor [tnf]-alpha and interleukin [il]-1beta). subgingival plaque samples were also examined for the occurrences of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella  forsythensis, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia. results: serum ages were significantly associated with deterioration of periodontitis, whereas no other serum biochemical marker or bacterial occurrence showed a clear relationship with that condition. conclusion: ages may be factors associated with diabetic periodontitis and may be useful as biomarkers that reflect such deterioration.

AB  == the aim of the study was to evaluate the early colonization of non-submerged implants over a 6-month period in partially edentulous patients treated for advanced aggressive periodontal disease. in 22 patients treated for advanced aggressive periodontitis and in a supportive maintenance program for a period between 12 and 240 months at implant surgery, a total of 68 non-submerged dental  implants were installed. patients had a plaque score below 20%, and less than 20% of the pockets around the teeth were bleeding on probing (bop). using dna-probes  (micro-ident), the presence and concentration of five periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), tannerella forsythensis (tf) and treponema denticola  (td)) were determined in the five deepest pockets of the rest dentition pre-operatively and after 6 months as well as five places around each implant 10  days, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after surgery. in each patient, a test to determine the genotype interleukin-1 (il-1) was performed (pst - micro-ident). after 6 months, no difference in microbial composition as compared with baseline  was found around the teeth in five patients, in 12 minute differences and in five patients important differences were observed. ten days after surgery, three patients had a complete similar bacterial composition between teeth and implants. in 14 patients, the composition was fairly similar, while large differences in composition and concentration occurred in five patients. this microbiota around the implants remained almost unchanged over a 6-month period and did not hamper the clinical and radiographic osseointegration and did not lead to peri-implantitis, mucositis or initiation of bone destruction.

TI  == detection of dna from periodontal pathogenic bacteria in biofilm obtained from waterlines in dental units.
AB  == direct person-to-person transmission of periodontal bacteria through saliva has recently been widely reported and dental units have been demonstrated to retract  saliva from patients under treatment and to release it into the mouths of subjects undergoing the next operation. in this study the presence of a group of  periodontal pathogenic bacteria inside waterlines in dental units was investigated using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) based methods. briefly, 18 dental units of three different manufacturers were studied. dental units were divided into two groups according to their prevalent use in routine practice. the first group consisted of nine dental units characterized by the frequent use of high-speed dental hand-pieces directly inside the mouth and in contact with patients' saliva. the second group, as a control, consisted of nine dental units  where high-speed dental hand-pieces were not in use. a one cm section of the waterline tubing connected to the high-speed hand-piece was removed from each dental unit to evaluate the presence of dna of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola. two specimens were positive for prevotella intermedia dna. all the positive results were from samples obtained from dental units categorised in the first group. these findings clearly suggest  that dental units have the potential to transmit periodontal pathogens. manufacturers should be invited to design dental units that incorporate automated devices to disinfect duwls between patients with minimal effort by dental staff.

TI  == periodontal diseases: microbiological considerations.
AB  == the location of plaque-associated gingivitis at the gingival portion of the tooth plays an essential role in its genesis. however, at times local and other host response modifying factors also have an influence. the pathogeny of periodontitis is more complex. the microorganisms that comprise subgingival plaque are capable  of acting directly on periodontal tissues or of modifying the host response, whereas the participation of the plaque per se (normal, decreased, or increased)  is as decisive as the action of the bacteria themselves in the emergence of the disease. different types of periodontitis are associated with specific microorganisms. the most periodontopathogenic are a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythensis. periodontitis as a whole, represent the source of complications such as root caries, endoperiodontal processes and periodontal abscesses. they are associated with various illnesses such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, and respiratory infections, amongst others, as well as pathological oral halitosis. the different modalities of pcr are particularly important in the microbiological diagnosis of periodontitis, although on the negative side of things, it must be pointed out that in vitro sensitivity studies cannot be performed using this technique. first line antibiotic treatment of periodontitis  includes amoxicillin/ clavulanic acid, metronidazole (associated or not with amoxicillin) and clindamycin.

AB  == quantitative analysis, with identification of periodontopathic bacteria, is important for the diagnosis, therapeutic evaluation and risk assessment of periodontal disease. we developed a highly sensitive and specific method using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to detect and quantify six periodontal  bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens. species-specific taqman probe/primer sets were designed according to  16s ribosomal rna gene sequences. plaque and tongue debris specimens were collected from 10 patients with advanced periodontitis and 10 periodontal healthy individuals and analyzed. all species, except for p. nigrescens, were detected in samples from diseased sites in significantly greater numbers than in those from healthy sites, whereas greater numbers of p. nigrescens were found in the controls. these results suggest that the present real-time pcr method with the designed probe/primer sets enabled sensitive detection of the six periodontal bacteria, and may also assist future microbial studies of periodontal diseases.

TI  == quadrant root planing versus same-day full-mouth root planing. ii. microbiological findings.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that over a period of 6 months, same-day full-mouth scaling and root planing (fm-srp) resulted in greater reductions in the detection frequency of five putative periodontal pathogens compared with quadrant scaling and root planing (q-srp) in chronic periodontitis patients. materials and methods: forty patients were recruited into this study. subjects were randomised into two groups. the fm-srp group received full-mouth scaling and root planing completed within the same day, while the q-srp group received quadrant root planing at 2-weekly intervals over four consecutive sessions. selected-site analyses were performed on the deepest site in each quadrant before and after therapy, at approximately 3 and 6 months from baseline (r1 and r2) and clinical indices were recorded with an electronic pressure-sensitive probe. in addition, subgingival plaque samples were collected  from these sites at baseline (bas), at reassessment 1 (r1), approximately 6 weeks after the completion of therapy and at reassessment 2 (r2), 6 months from baseline. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used to determine the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in plaque. results: both therapies resulted in significant improvements in all clinical indices both  at r1 and r2. a marked reduction in the presence of all candidate periodontal pathogens was noted after both treatment modalities, reaching statistical significance for the majority of the test organisms. these improvements were maintained over a period of 6 months. when the two treatment groups were compared, a significantly higher percentage of q-srp patients was positive for p. intermedia at r1 compared with fm-srp patients (p<0.05). in addition, a greater reduction in the patient prevalence for t. denticola was found for the fm-srp group than the q-srp group at r1 and r2 from baseline (p<0.005), but the significance of this is questionable given the skewed detection frequency of this organism at baseline between the two treatments (p<0.01). conclusion: this study  failed to confirm that same-day fm-srp resulted in greater microbiological improvements compared with q-srp at 2-weekly intervals over a 6-month period, as  determined by pcr.

AB  == backgrounds/aims: the aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical, radiological and microbiological response to the local delivery of tetracycline (te) of sites  with persistent periodontal lesions. materials and methods: the study was conducted in a split-mouth design. nineteen patients with at least four bilateral pockets 4-5 mm and bleeding on probing (bop) were treated with scaling and root planing (srp) plus te fibres (test sites) or with srp alone (control sites). clinical and radiological measurements were taken at baseline, 6 months and 12 months post-operatively. subgingival plaque samples were collected at baseline, at fibres removal, 6 and 12 months following treatment and analysed by polymerase chain reaction. results: both treatments yielded a statistically significant (p<0.05) reduction of probing depth (2.05 and 1.21 mm), gain of clinical attachment level (1.71 and 0.53 mm) and reduction of bop scores (23.68% and 57.89%) for te and srp groups, respectively, when comparing 12-month data with baseline. the differences between two groups were significant. the prevalence of  treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus decreased after therapy in both groups but only in the test sites actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia were not yield detected. the pathogens could be eliminated  from five periodontal pockets by srp alone, while 21 te sites were not recolonized at 12 months. conclusions: srp plus te fibres gave the greatest advantage in the treatment of periodontal persistent lesions at least 12 months following treatment.

TI  == quadrant root planing versus same-day full-mouth root planing.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to determine whether same-day full-mouth scaling and root planing (fm-srp) and quadrant scaling and root planing (q-srp) resulted in variations in the systemic humoral immune response dynamics (antibody titres and avidity) during active treatment and 3 and 6 months post-therapy. materials and methods: forty patients with chronic periodontitis were recruited into this study. subjects were randomised into two groups and received either scaling and root planing quadrant by quadrant at 2-weekly intervals (q-srp group) or same-day full-mouth scaling and root planing (fm-srp group). clinical measurements and serum samples were obtained at baseline and approximately 6 weeks after the last clinical intervention (r1) and 6 months after the initiation of therapy (r2). furthermore, serum samples were obtained from each patient undergoing therapy (q-srp and fm-srp) at 3 bi-weekly instances so as to determine the short-term effects of each session of scaling and root planing on the dynamics of the humoral immune response. serum antibody titre was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and antibody avidity was measured by thiocyanate dissociation against five putative periodontal pathogens: porphyromonas gingivalis; actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; prevotella intermedia; treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus. results: both therapies resulted in similar antibody titre reductions against the majority of the organisms tested and although there was a distinct trend for antibody avidity to increase following therapy, this was not found to be statistically significant, reflecting marked inter-individual variation. in addition, no evidence emerged from this study to support increased antibody titres following the active phases of both treatment approaches due to an inoculation effect. nevertheless, significant short-term increases in antibody avidity to most test bacteria were noted for both treatment strategies. conclusion: both therapies were associated with a reduction in antibody titres and an increase in the binding ability or avidity of antibodies, but there was a marked inter-subject variability and statistical significance was reached for only some of the test bacteria. no significant differences in the humoral antibody dynamics were found  between the two treatment approaches.

TI  == occurrence of periodontal bacteria in healthy children: a 2-year longitudinal study.
AB  == objectives: to examine the occurrence of specific periodontal bacteria in children and adolescents. methods: ten putative periodontal bacteria were longitudinally examined in plaque and saliva samples from 119 periodontally healthy children (2-15 years old) using a polymerase chain reaction method. results: capnocytophaga ochracea, c. sputigena, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were frequently found in saliva, and tended to persist in saliva for the remainder of the study, whereas porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia were rarely detected. p. nigrescens was more frequently detected in plaque and its prevalence increased with age. eikenella corrodens and campylobacter rectus were sometimes detected in both plaque and saliva, while tannerella forsythensis was occasionally detected in saliva. conclusion: a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, p. nigrescens, c. rectus, and e. corrodens are common members of the oral microbial  flora of healthy children, whereas p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. denticola appear to be transient organisms.

TI  == prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in aggressive periodontitis patients in a japanese population.
AB  == background: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is considered a major etiologic  agent of aggressive periodontitis. other periodontopathic bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis are also suspected of participating in aggressive periodontitis, although the evidence is controversial. the aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria and to clarify the microbiological features of aggressive periodontitis in japanese patients. methods: subgingival plaque was collected from 50 aggressive periodontitis (agp) patients (localized 10, generalized 40). samples from 35 generalized chronic periodontitis (cp) patients and 18 healthy subjects were examined as controls. plaque samples were examined using culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. results: the prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans  was relatively low in the localized (20%) and generalized (17.5%) agp patients, with no significant difference observed in detection frequencies between agp and  the control groups (cp 8.6%, healthy 0%). on the other hand, tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus), campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, and treponema denticola were frequently detected in localized as well as generalized aggressive periodontitis patients. the prevalence and proportion of p. gingivalis correlated with severity of clinical attachment loss in both localized and generalized aggressive periodontitis. conclusions: t. forsythensis, c. rectus, p. gingivalis, and t. denticola were the predominant periodontopathic  bacteria of aggressive periodontitis patients in japan. although a. actinomycetem- comitans was also detected in agp patients, the prevalence of this bacterium was much lower than that of p. gingivalis.

TI  == subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.
AB  == little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. we assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. a pooled subgingival plaque  sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold,  between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. the percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. miswak users harbored significantly higher streptococcus intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, veillonella parvula, actinomyces israelii, and capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower selenomonas sputigena, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, and streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (p <  0.05) higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and v. parvula than those 4-5 mm. our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.

TI  == transmission of periodontal disease-associated bacteria from teeth to osseointegrated implant regions.
AB  == purpose: the presence of periodontopathic bacteria is a risk factor for peri-implantitis. the present study examined colonization by periodontopathic bacteria and their transmission from periodontal pockets to osseointegrated implant sulcus. materials and methods: plaque samples were collected from 105 sites in the 15 patients who participated in the study. colonization by these bacteria was examined by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and culture. the transmission of periodontopathic bacteria from periodontal sites of natural teeth to the implant sulcus was analyzed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). results: the pcr detection rates of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola were 80.0%, 53.3%, 46.7%, 60.0% and 40.0%, respectively. colonizations by p gingivalis and a actinomycetemcomitans were statistically correlated with periodontal pockets and implant sulcus regions (p < .01). the pfge patterns of the p gingivalis strains isolated from each patient were identical, but differed from those from other patients. the pfge patterns of p intermedia strains were identical in 2 out of 3 patients. discussion: these analyses indicated that there appeared to be transmission of p gingivalis and p intermedia from the periodontal pocket to the peri-implant region. conclusion: elimination of these periodontal pathogens from the patient's oral cavity before  administering dental implant treatment may inhibit colonization by these pathogens and reduce the risk of peri-implantitis.

TI  == comparison of microbial cultivation and a commercial pcr based method for detection of periodontopathogenic species in subgingival plaque samples.
AB  == objectives: microbiological laboratory procedures are involved in diagnosis and therapy control of progressive and refractory forms of periodontitis. in recent years techniques have been developed based on the detection of nucleic acids. the purpose of this study was to validate the commercially available micro-dent(r) test which employs probes for a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, b. forsythus and t. denticola. methods: 122 plaque samples obtained from periodontal pockets with various depths from 33 early onset periodontitis (eop) patients and 15 periodontally healthy subjects were analysed by cultivation and the microdent(r) kit. results: both cultivation and the nucleic acid based assay showed a positive correlation of pocket depth with the frequency and quantity of periodontopathogenic species. t. denticola was found only in pockets  > 4 mm in eop patients. comparison of the two methods revealed that the microdent(r) kit identified both p. gingivalis and b. forsythus more often than did the cultivation method. conclusions: nucleic acid techniques should replace cultivation methods as gold standard in microbiological diagnosis of progressive  periodontitis. the micro-dent(r) kit can be recommended for microbiological laboratories analysing subgingival plaque samples.

TI  == relationship of changes in interleukin-8 levels and granulocyte elastase activity in gingival crevicular fluid to subgingival periodontopathogens following non-surgical periodontal therapy in subjects with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == objectives: to determine the effect of scaling and root planing (srp) on the interrelations of subgingival periodontopathogens and both interleukin-8 (il-8) and granulocyte elastase activity in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf), and to assess their relations to the short-term treatment response in management of chronic periodontitis. material and methods: gcf and subgingival plaque were collected from 16 subjects with untreated chronic periodontitis at baseline and 4 weeks after srp. il-8 levels were determined by elisa. granulocyte elastase activity was analyzed with a specific substrate, pgluproval-pna, and the maximal  rate of elastase activity (mr-ea) was calculated. 5 dna-probes were used to detect the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans (a. a.), b. forsythus (b.f.), p.  gingivalis (p.g.), p. intermedia (p.i.), and t. denticola (t.d.), with a sensitivity = 103 cells/paper point. results: il-8 and mr-ea levels in gcf decreased significantly after srp (p < 0.001) with a corresponding reduction of total count of the species. of the sites with probing depth (pd) >/= 5.0 mm and co-infection by b.f., p.g., p.i. & t.d. at baseline, the sites without persistent co-infection of these species after srp exhibited a significant reduction of il-8 levels (p < 0.02), mr-ea levels (p < 0.02) and pd (p < 0.01). no such change was  found in the sites where such a co-infection persisted. moreover, reduction of il-8 levels in those pocket sites was accompanied by a concomitant reduction of mr-ea (p < 0.02) and pd (p < 0.01), while no significant change in mr-ea levels and pd was noted in those pocket sites that exhibited an increase of il-8 levels  after srp. at baseline, the former group of sites showed significantly higher il-8 levels than the latter group of sites (p < 0.02). conclusions: il-8-related  granulocyte elastase activity was related to the change in infection patterns of  the target periodontopathogens following scaling and root planing. varying initial il-8 levels in gcf and a corresponding shifting change of granulocyte elastase activity in gcf may characterize the different short-term treatment responses.

TI  == microbiological findings and host response in patients with peri-implantitis.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to characterise microbiota and inflammatory host response around implants and teeth in patients with peri-implantitis. we included 17 partly edentulous patients with a total of 98 implants, of which 45 showed marginal bone loss of more than three fixture threads after the first year of loading. nineteen subjects with stable marginal tissue conditions served as controls. oral hygiene, gingival inflammation, and probing pocket depth were evaluated clinically at teeth and implants. microbiological and crevicular fluid  samples were collected from five categories of sites: 1) implants with peri-implantitis (pi), 2) stable implants (si) in patients with both stable and peri-implantitis implants, 3) control implants (ci) in patients with stable implants alone, 4) teeth in patients (tp) and 5) controls (tc). crevicular fluid  from teeth and implants was analysed for elastase activity, lactoferrin and il-1  beta concentrations. elastase activity was higher at pi than at ci in controls. lactoferrin concentration was higher at pi than at si in patients with peri-implantitis. higher levels of both lactoferrin and elastase activity were found at pi than at teeth in patients. the concentrations of il-1 beta were about the same in the various sites. microbiological dna-probe analysis revealed a putative periodontal microflora at teeth and implants in patients and controls. patients with peri-implantitis harboured high levels of periodontal pathogens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus and treponema denticola. these findings indicate a site-specific inflammation rather than a patient-associated specific host response.

TI  == [identification of periodontopathic bacteria dna from periodontitis-involved gingival tissue using a pcr method].
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the presence of periodontopathic bacteria dna in the granulation tissue of periodontally involved gingival tissue. forty periodontitis patients were examined. subgingival plaque and saliva samples were collected from the patients before surgery. then, granulation tissue was also collected during surgery. another 20 patients, who had more than 4 mm in probing pocket depth, were also examined as a control. they received only initial treatment without periodontal surgery. plaque and saliva samples were also collected from them. seven periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, toreponema denticola, campylobacter rectus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens, were detected by a pcr method from these samples of all patients. as clinical parameters, probing pocket depth, clinical attachment level, and bleeding on probing were recorded. one year after surgery, sampling of subgingival plaque and saliva, and measurement of clinical parameters were performed on the patients. the dna of periodontopathic bacteria was detected in the granulation tissue of 29 out of 40 patients. p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, t. denticola, c. rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens were detected in 23, 11, 12, 9, 3, 2 and 1 subject(s) respectively. the sites with undetectable level of any periodontal pathogens at one year after surgery showed a clinical attachment  gain of 2.44 mm, while those that showed detectable pathogen levels had only a 0.77 mm gain. our results indicated that the removal of granulation tissue contributed to eliminating periodontal pathogens and to avoiding re-infection by  those bacteria. complete eradication of periodontopathic bacteria would be necessary for successful periodontal treatment.

TI  == clinical and microbiological studies of periodontal disease in sjogren syndrome patients.
AB  == background: little is known about the periodontal status of patients with sjogren's syndrome (ss), a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized  by xerophthalmia and xerostomia. the aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the periodontal status of ss patients, in terms of clinical and microbiological parameters, differs from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls. methods: 8 primary ss and 10 secondary ss patients were  examined in comparison with 11 control subjects. all patients were diagnosed by the european community criteria. control subjects were systemically healthy and not undergoing periodontal treatment. the comparison of clinical status was made  in terms of mean periodontal parameters (plaque index, gingival index, gingival recession, probing pocket depth, probing attachment level and bleeding on probing) as well as the frequency distribution of probing pocket depth and probing attachment level measurements. microbiological assays of the subgingival  dental plaque samples were carried out by both a chairside enzyme test (periocheck) for the detection of peptidase activity (pa) and a polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) analysis for 9 selected periodontal micro-organisms (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, streptococcus oralis). results: the  occurrence, severity and extent of periodontal lesions were not significantly different between the 3 patient groups for all periodontal parameters examined. no significant differences in the sub-gingival plaque samples from control, primary or secondary ss patients for the pa test, frequency or type of periodontal micro-organisms observed. conclusion: no significant differences could be detected in either clinical or microbiological parameters of primary or  secondary ss patients compared with that of control subjects. the results of the  present study thus support the notion that the periodontal status of patients with ss do not differ from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls.

TI  == periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood.
AB  == background: little information is available on periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood. we assessed the prevalence by age of 10 putative periodontopathic microorganisms in periodontally healthy children using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay. methods: plaque samples were collected from the buccal-mesial sulcus of the first molar or second primary molar in the right upper quadrant of 144 children (2 to 13 years old, 12 subjects from each year of age) who showed negligible periodontal inflammation. using species-specific primers of porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, and treponema denticola, pcr amplification was performed with bacterial genomic dna from plaque samples. results: the results indicated that c. rectus, e. corrodens, a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. ochracea, and c. sputigena were found in about 50% of the plaque samples from all age groups, while b. forsythus and p. intermedia were detected less frequently, and p. gingivalis and t. denticola were not found. in contrast, the percentage of p.  nigrescens-positive subjects increased with age in primary dentition, and reached about 50% at 7 years of age and older. subject-based analyses suggested that the  number of bacterial species in the plaque samples increased gradually with age until 5 years old, and then reached a plateau after the mixed dentition period. conclusions: the colonization of many putative periodontopathic microorganisms can occur quite early in childhood without clinical signs of periodontal disease. however, colonization by p. gingivalis and t. denticola was not detected in periodontally healthy children.

TI  == the localization of periodontal-disease-associated bacteria in human periodontal  pockets.
AB  == some gram-negative anaerobes are associated with the incidence and progression of periodontal disease. in periodontal pockets, however, the localization of those bacteria is unknown. we investigated the localization of 5 bacterial species in human periodontal pockets. fifteen teeth with a part of periodontal pockets from  10 adult periodontitis patients were obtained, and the localization of bacteria was examined immunohistochemically. positive reactions with anti-prevotella nigrescens antibody were located at the epithelium-associated plaque area in the  middle pocket zones. in the middle and deep pocket zones, fusobacterium nucleatum and treponema denticola were especially localized in the unattached plaque area,  but eikenella corrodens was observed in the tooth-attached plaque area. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, detected in 2 of 15 samples examined, was found in the unattached plaque area, in the middle pocket zone. the present findings indicated that the 5 bacterial species examined localized at distinct regions in human periodontal pockets.

TI  == efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (ii). effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == humoral immune response in early-onset periodontitis: influence of smoking.
AB  == sixty-five patients with generalised early-onset periodontitis (g-eop) (age range 16-42 years, 32 smokers and 33 non-smokers) were assessed for antibody titres and avidity to a panel of five suspected periodontal pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus). thirty-four of these patients were untreated (17 smokers and 17 non-smokers), and thirty-one were in the maintenance phase of periodontal therapy (15 smokers and 16 non-smokers). previous studies have investigated the effect of smoking on igg levels in periodontitis patients in the context of the more extensive periodontal destruction seen in smokers. based on this literature our hypothesis was that smokers would have depressed serum igg levels directed against recognised periodontal pathogens compared with non-smokers. antibody titres were measured by elisa deploying fixed whole cells as coating. the igg response was detected with  biotin-anti-human igg and avidin-peroxidase; avidity was determined by elution with ammonium thiocyanate. median titres to a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and t. denticola were significantly lower in maintenance patient smokers (p= 0.02, 0.02 and 0.002 respectively) but not in untreated patients. avidity to p. gingivalis was also lower in smoking maintenance patients (p = 0.003) but not in untreated patients. these findings may imply some interruption  of immune maturation in smokers following periodontal treatment.

TI  == clinical periodontal findings and microflora profiles in children with chronic neutropenia under supervised oral hygiene.
AB  == background: this is the first known case report that used a polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based method to help identify the oral microflora in patients with chronic neutropenia. in this study, we report clinical periodontal findings and microflora profiles of 2 children, 1 with severe congenital neutropenia (scn, kostmann type) and 1 with cyclic neutropenia (cn). methods: the scn patient had severe gingivitis, whereas the patient with cn had mild gingivitis in the gingival margins. monthly oral cleaning instruction and review were performed without subsequent periodontal therapy. oral hygiene conditions remained satisfactory and visible plaque was scarce, despite the persistence of mild gingivitis. under supervised oral hygiene, we examined the presence of periodontal pathogens from patient plaque samples. results: by a pcr-based method, prevotella nigrescens, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, and capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in the scn patient and p. intermedia, c.  rectus, c. gingivalis, and c. sputigena in the cn patient, suggesting the existence of periodontal pathogens. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and c. ochracea were not found in  either patient. conclusions: use of 1% povidone iodine solution and local antibiotic application under supervised oral hygiene were helpful to improve gingival conditions in patients with chronic neutropenia.

AB  == a 16s rdna-directed polymerase chain reaction method was used to assess the occurrence of four black-pigmented anaerobic rods, treponema denticola, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in acute periradicular abscesses. pus was collected by aspiration from 10 cases diagnosed as acute abscesses of endodontic  origin. dna was extracted from the samples and analyzed using a polymerase chain  reaction-based identification assay. the method allowed detecting black-pigmented anaerobes in 80% of the examined abscesses. porphyromonas endodontalis was found  in 70%, t. denticola in 50%, porphyromonas gingivalis in 40%, and prevotella intermedia in 10% of the cases. p. gingivalis was always found associated with p. endodontalis. prevotella nigrescens and a. actinomycetemcomitans were not found in any pus sample. the high prevalence of p. endodontalis, t. denticola, and p. gingivalis suggests that they can play an important role in the etiology of acute periradicular abscesses.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of silver nitrate against periodontal pathogens.
AB  == metal ions were evaluated as potential antimicrobial agents suitable for local delivery in the oral cavity for the treatment of periodontitis. silver nitrate, copper chloride, and zinc chloride were tested for antimicrobial activity in in vitro killing assays conducted in phosphate buffered saline with a series of oral bacteria including gram-negative periodontal pathogens and gram-positive streptococci. copper and zinc salts failed to exhibit strong and consistent activity against periodontal pathogens. in contrast, silver at a concentration of 0.5 microg/ml produced a 3 log10 reduction in colony forming units (cfu)/ml or greater against all periodontal pathogens tested including porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum vincentii, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus,  eikenella corrodens, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. in comparison, substantially higher concentrations of silver nitrate failed to kill oral streptococci. a silver nitrate concentration of 25 microg/ml produced log10 reductions in cfu/ml of 3.5-5 in killing assays performed in human serum against  p. gingivalis, demonstrating the ability of silver to retain activity in a biological medium similar to that encountered in vivo in the periodontal pocket.  these results identify silver nitrate, an antimicrobial that may possess advantages over traditional antibiotics, as a potential agent for controlled release local delivery in the oral cavity for the treatment of periodontitis.

TI  == relationship of periodontopathic bacteria with early-onset periodontitis in down's syndrome.
AB  == background: down's syndrome (ds) patients often develop severe early-onset marginal periodontitis in early adulthood; however, there is little information available on the microbiology of ds periodontitis. methods: subgingival plaque specimens were taken from 67 ds young adults and 41 age-matched systemically healthy individuals with mental disabilities (md). the prevalence of 10 possible  periodontopathic bacterial species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola, prevotella  intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were investigated in their subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction method. the detection of p. gingivalis fima genotypes was also performed in p. gingivalis-positive samples. results: although ds subjects generally develop an earlier and more extensive periodontal breakdown than those with md, no significant differences were observed in the bacterial profiles. the profiles of  subjects with periodontitis were significant in ds, but not in md. the prevalence of p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and p. intermedia were significant in the ds periodontitis group, compared to ds gingivitis group. moreover, the occurrence of p. gingivalis with the type ii fima gene was significantly related to periodontitis in both ds and md, with odds ratios of 6.32 and 12.03, respectively. conclusions: these results suggest that early-onset periodontitis in ds is mainly due to the more susceptible host for the causative microbial agents including p. gingivalis with type ii fima.

AB  == aim: the present investigation was undertaken to analyze the influence of smoking on the periodontal disease associated subgingival microflora. the population included 33 smokers and 31 non-smokers in the age range 36-86 years. methods: microbial samples were obtained from 4 sites per patient. the checker-board dna-dna hybridization technology was used for detection of the bacterial species  p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, b. forsythus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, t. denticola, p. micros, c. rectus, e. corrodens, s. noxia and s. intermedius. results: using score 1 as cutoff, contrasting colonized versus non-colonized patients, 8 out of 12 species were detected in > or = 90% of both smokers and non-smokers. using score 4 as cutoff,  contrasting heavily colonized patients versus non-colonized and less heavily colonized patients, the detection rates decreased in both smokers and non-smokers. no significant differences in detection rates were observed between  smokers and non-smokers. logistic regression analysis indicated that neither smoking, probing depth nor gingival bleeding influenced the occurrence of the species analyzed. the lack of a smoking exposure dose-response further supported  the indication of a limited influence of smoking. conclusion: smoking exerts little, if any, influence on the subgingival occurrence of several of the bacteria most commonly associated with periodontal disease.

TI  == comparison of profiles of key periodontal pathogens in periodontium and endodontium.
AB  == despite the established anatomical relationship between the periodontal and pulpal tissues, bacterial migration between endodontium and periodontium is still under discussion. the objective of this study was an investigation of profiles of periodontal pathogens in pulpal and periodontal diseases affecting the same tooth by means of 16s rrna gene directed polymerase chain reaction (pcr). 31 intact teeth with both pulp and marginal infections were investigated. the diagnosis was based on clinical and radiological examination. samples were taken from the gingival sulcus or periodontal pocket, respectively, with sterile paper points before trepanation of the teeth. after trepanation sterile paper points and hedstroem files were used for taking samples from the root canal. specific pcr methods were used to detect the presence of the following pathogens: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola. in addition, quantitative competitive pcr was used to determine the total bacterial count of the samples. the investigated pathogens were proven to be present in the endondontium in all disease categories. particularly in endodontic samples of "chronic apical periodontitis" and "chronic adult periodontitis" profiles of the periodontal pathogens were found. the results confirmed that periodontal pathogens often accompany endodontic infections and supported the idea that the periodontic-endodontic interrelationships should be considered as critical pathways which might contribute to refractory courses of endodontic or periodontal diseases.

TI  == assessment of periradicular microbiota by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == in the present study the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. in group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. the gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. bacterial dna was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. the mean number (+/- sd) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in group 2 (p < 0.001). the majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from group 1 than from group 2. the differences were most notable for campylobacter gracilis, porphyromonas endodontalis, propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, streptococcus constellatus and actinomyces naeslundii i. bacterial species such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. also, p. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. the data supported the idea that  following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. the study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. the detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.

TI  == the clinical and microbiological effects of systemic ornidazole in sites with and without subgingival debridement in early-onset periodontitis patients.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of systemic ornidazole (orn) in sites with or without subgingival debridement in early-onset periodontitis (eop) patients. methods: two pooled bacterial samples consisting of 4 sites each (scaled and non-scaled sites) were obtained from 30 individuals exhibiting eop. all patients received oral hygiene instruction (ohi), supragingival scaling and orn. subgingival scaling and root planing (srp) was carried out only in scaled sites. bacterial samples were taken at baseline (bl) and 1 week and 2, 6, and 12 months after systemic ornidazole administration (500 mg/bid for 7 days). one more sample was taken at scaled sites, one week after srp. results: one week following srp (scaled sites)  gram-negative facultative and anaerobic rods were significantly reduced while gram-positive facultative cocci were significantly increased. after orn administration, p. gingivalis, p. denticola, p. intermedia, b. forsythus, c. rectus, and s. sputigena were no longer detectable in either scaled or non-scaled sites. a statistically significant long-term (2, 6, and 12 months) reduction of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. loescheii, b. forsythus, and c. rectus and a pronounced increase of s. milleri, s. oralis, and s. sanguis counts in both scaled and non-scaled sites were detected in comparison to baseline. a sustained  reduction of bleeding tendency and of probing depth was also observed in both scaled and non-scaled sites. conclusions: orn combined with srp effects beneficial shifts in the bacterial population associated with substantial clinical improvement, thereby indicating that orn is effective adjunct in the treatment of eop deep periodontal pockets where anaerobic bacteria are predominant.

TI  == identification of periodontal disease-associated bacteria in the "plaque-free zone".
AB  == background: subgingival plaque bacteria live within a biofilm covered with glycocalyx, and little is known of the bacterial species associated with biofilm  formation at the bottom of human periodontal pockets, the so-called "plaque-free  zone"(pfz). methods: seventy-seven extracted teeth from 56 patients with severe advanced adult periodontitis were examined. porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, prevotella nigrescens, and actinomyces viscosus were examined by scanning immunoelectron microscopic techniques, using both secondary and back-scattered imaging, with rabbit antibodies specific for each bacteria. results: secondary electron images showed  that rods, filaments, and spirochete-shaped bacteria formed small aggregates in the pfz. some of the bacteria were covered with an amorphous film-like structure. by back-scattered electron imaging, positive reactions with anti-p. gingivalis were found in 8 of 13 samples examined, and film-like structures coated several cells of 6 positive samples examined. labeled cells with anti-c. rectus, anti-t.  denticola and anti-p. nigrescens were detected in 3 of 11, 5 of 10, and 1 of 8 samples examined. a. viscosus were found in 6 of 11 of the samples. a. viscosus tended to overlay the amorphous capsula and aggregate. f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans were not detected in any samples examined. conclusions: these findings indicated that p. gingivalis, c. rectus, t. denticola, p. nigrescens, and a. viscosus were present in the pfz, and that some specified bacteria were possibly related to plaque-biofilm formation of subgingival plaque.

TI  == interleukin-8 and granulocyte elastase in gingival crevicular fluid in relation to periodontopathogens in untreated adult periodontitis.
AB  == background: this study aimed to determine the relationships among interleukin (il)-8 and granulocyte elastase levels in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) and the concomitant presence of periodontopathogens in untreated adult periodontitis. methods: gcf and subgingival plaque samples were collected from 16 patients with  untreated adult periodontitis and 10 healthy control subjects. il-8 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). granulocyte elastase was analyzed with a neutrophilic granulocyte-specific, low molecular weight and chromogenic substrate, l-pyroglutamyl-l-prolyl-l-valine-p-nitroanilide, and the maximal rate of elastase activity (mr-ea) was calculated. five dna probes were used to detect the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), b. forsythus (b.f.), p. gingivalis (p.g.), p. intermedia (p.i.), and t. denticola (t.d.). results: lower il-8 concentrations and higher granulocyte elastase activities were found in patients than in healthy controls as well as in diseased conditions co-infected with b.f., p.g., p.i., and t.d. as compared to healthy conditions without the target species (p <0.05). il-8 concentrations were positively correlated with mr-ea levels in the periodontitis conditions co-infected with b.f., p.g., p.i., and t.d. (p <0.05). a wide range of il-8 concentrations was found among 15 patients when the periodontitis condition was characterized by co-infection with b.f., p.g., p.i., and t.d. mr-ea levels in the high il-8 group  of subjects were significantly higher than those in the low il-8 group of subjects (p <0.01). conclusions: the present study shows that the local host-bacteria interactions in untreated periodontitis are diverse in terms of the intensity of inflammatory responses measured by il-8-related granulocyte elastase activity in gcf. this might reflect different phases of the inflammatory response due to shifts in host-bacteria interactions and therefore be indicative of a range of periodontal disease activity levels.

TI  == "checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  == background: we explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum igg responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. methods: one hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients  aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject;  2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic dna probes. serum igg antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. results: cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of eikenella corrodens, veillonella  parvula, and actinomyces naeslundii in controls. cases displayed higher igg levels against p. gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against f. nucleatum, t. denticola, e. nodatum,  and capnocytophaga ochracea. positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. in cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species  out of which only one was positive (v. parvula). both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. a logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. conclusion: a combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.

TI  == the prevalence of pathogenic periodontal microflora in healthy young adult smokers.
AB  == background: smoking is a major risk factor in periodontitis, although the mechanisms of its effects are not well understood. the overall goal of this clinical study was to determine if smoking enhances the colonization of the oral  cavity by pathogenic bacteria in a periodontitis-free population. the prevalence  of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola was investigated in 25 smokers and 25 non-smokers by using dna probes. methods: the subjects were 21 to 35 years of  age with a healthy periodontium or slight gingivitis and were systemically healthy. the test group included subjects who had a minimum of a 1.5 pack-year history of smoking, while the control subjects never smoked. subgingival plaque samples were taken by paper point following the assessment of multiple clinical parameters. results: this investigation showed: 1) no statistically significant differences were noted in any clinical parameter measured between the groups; 2)  of the 8 subjects who were infected by at least 1 tested pathogen, seven were smokers (p= 0.02); 3) infected smokers had a 15.7+/-3.5 pack-year history and smoked a mean of 27+/-5 cigarettes/day versus 4.4+/-0.8 pack years and 15+/-1 cigarettes/day for the non-infected smokers (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.004); and 4) smokers were 18 times more likely to exhibit the presence of pathogens than non-smokers. conclusions: these data indicate that the prevalence of colonization of the sulcus by pathogenic bacterial species in periodontitis-free individuals is related to the quantity and duration of cigarette smoking.

TI  == periodontopathic bacteria in children with down syndrome.
AB  == background: it is widely known that individuals with down syndrome (ds) often develop severe early-onset periodontal diseases. in this study, we examined the prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in ds children to determine if specific pathogens are acquired in their childhood. methods: the subjects were 60 ds children (2 to 13 years old, 5 in each age bracket) and 60 age-matched controls.  ten pathogens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, p nigrescens,  capnocytophaga ochracea, c. sputigena, campyrobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens were surveyed in subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction. periodontal status was evaluated by probing depth, bleeding on probing, and gingival index. results: no significant difference in periodontal status was  observed between the ds and control groups, however, all of the pathogens were detected with greater frequency in the ds children. b. forsythus, t. denticola, p. nigrescens, and c. rectus were significantly prevalent throughout all age brackets of the ds children (p <0.01 or 0.05). the occurrence of p. gingivalis was also significant in the ds subjects over 5 years old. a cluster analysis of the microbial profiles of the ds subjects showed that gingivitis severity was associated with increased varieties of the harboring pathogens and the distribution of p. gingivalis. conclusions: these results suggest that various periodontopathogens can colonize in the very early childhood of ds patients and maturation of subgingival components, including p. gingivalis, plays an important role in the initiation of gingival inflammation.

TI  == granulocyte elastase activity and pge2 levels in gingival crevicular fluid in relation to the presence of subgingival periodontopathogens in subjects with untreated adult periodontitis.
AB  == this study aimed to determine the association between the levels of granulocyte elastase and prostaglandin e2 (pge2) in gce and the concomitant presence of periodontopathogens in untreated adult periodontitis (ap). gcf and subgingival plaque were sampled by paper strips and paper points respectively, from various periodontal sites in 16 ap subjects. granulocyte elastase activity in gcf was analyzed with a low molecular weight substrate specific for granulocyte elastase, pgluproval-pna, and the maximal rate of elastase activity (mr-ea, mabs/min/site)  was calculated. pge2 levels in gcf were determined by radioimmunoassay. 5 species-specific dna probes were used to detect the presence of a. actinomyceterncomitans (a.a., atcc 43718), b. forsythus (b.f, atcc 43037), p. gingivalis (p.g., atcc 33277), p. intermedia (p.i., atcc 33563), and t. denticola (t.d., atcc 35405), with a sensitivity of 10(3) cells/paper point. no a.a. was detectable from all sites sampled. the predominant combination of species detected was b.f., p.g., p.i. & t.d. and it was significantly higher at periodontitis sites (68%) than at healthy (7%) or gingivitis sites (29%) (p<0.05). overall, mr-ea values were strongly correlated with pge2 levels (r=0.655, p<0.001), especially at these periodontitis sites co-infected by b.f.,  p.g., p.i. & t.d. (r=0.722, p<0.001). the periodontitis sites co-infected by the  4 species were observable from 15 subjects. these sites were sub-grouped into 8 subjects with a high mr-ea and 7 subjects with a low mr-ea. the pge2 levels in the high mr-ea group were significantly higher than in the low mr-ea group (p<0.05). no significant differences in clinical or bacterial data were found between the two groups. while within the high mr-ea group, similar results were found between the paired periodontitis sites in each subject with highest and lowest mr-ea values. this study shows that the local host response to bacterial challenge in untreated periodontal pockets is diverse in terms of the intensity of inflammatory response measured by granulocyte elastase and pge2 levels in gce  a more thorough evaluation of the risk for active periodontal disease may involve the combined approaches to the test of the dynamic bacteria-host relations.

TI  == relationship between herpesviruses and adult periodontitis and periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == background: various mammalian viruses and specific bacteria seem to play important roles in the pathogenesis of human periodontitis. this study examined the relationship between subgingival herpesviruses and periodontal disease and potential periodontopathic bacteria in 140 adults exhibiting either periodontitis or gingivitis. methods: a nested-polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method determined the presence of epstein-barr virus type 1 and type 2 (ebv-1, ebv-2), human cytomegalovirus (hcmv), and herpes simplex virus (hsv) and a 16s rrna pcr detection method identified actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens,  and treponema denticola. results: using a logistic analysis, ebv-1 showed significant positive association with p. gingivalis (odds ratio [or] 3.37), and with coinfections of p. gingivalis and p. intermedia (or 4.03); p. gingivalis and b. forsythus (or 3.84); p. gingivalis and t. denticola (or 4.17); p. gingivalis,  b. forsythus, and t. denticola (or 4.06); and p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, and t. denticola (or 3.29). ebv-1 also showed positive association with severe periodontitis (or 5.09), with increasing age (or 1.03), and with periodontal probing depth at the sample sites (or 1.77). hcmv was positively associated with  coinfections of p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens (or 3.23); p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and p. nigrescens (or 3.23); and p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, and t.  denticola (or 2.59); with severe periodontitis (or 4.65); and with age (or 1.03). patients with mixed viral infections revealed significant associations with p. gingivalis (or 2.27), and with coinfections of p. gingivalis and b. forsythus (or 2.06); p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens (or 2.91); p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and p. nigrescens (or 2.91); and p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, and t. denticola (or 2.70) with the clinical diagnosis of slight (or 3.73), moderate (or 3.82), or severe periodontitis (or 4.36), and with probing depth at the sample sites (or 1.39). hsv and ebv-2 showed no significant associations with any of the variables tested. conclusions: the results indicate that subgingival ebv-1, hcmv, and viral coinfections are associated with the subgingival presence of some periodontal pathogens and periodontitis. herpesviruses may exert periodontopathic potential by decreasing the host resistance against subgingival colonization and multiplication of periodontal pathogens.

TI  == local metronidazole application in maintenance patients. clinical and microbiological evaluation.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effect of local antibiotic therapy in comparison with subgingival scaling and root planing in a randomized semi-masked study. forty-six recall patients who completed systematic periodontal therapy 6 to 24 months prior to the study were enrolled. the inclusion requirements were at least one site with probing depth > or = 5 mm in each quadrant, no scaling, and no antibiotic therapy during the last 6 months. after randomization each patient received 2 different treatments: in 2 quadrants metronidazole 25% dental gel was applied subgingivally to the pockets at day 0 and day 7; scaling and root planing was carried out in the 2 other quadrants, one at day 0 and in the remaining quadrant at day 7. subgingival microbiological samples were taken from each patient before treatment and on days 21, 91, and 175 after the treatment. the analyses were carried out by indirect immunofluorescence assay. at all treated sites probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded on days 0, 21, 91, and 175. both treatments resulted in pd reduction and cal gain. pd reduction was statistically significant (p < 0.01) for both treatment modalities after 6 months. the cal gain was not significant for either treatment. there was no statistical significance between scaling and antibiotic therapy. treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia were significantly reduced after therapy; however, there were no statistically significant differences between treatments. if actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was present before therapy, it was also present after treatment in both groups. the conclusion is that, in recall patients, local application of metronidazole and scaling and root planing showed similar clinical and microbiological effects without statistically significant differences.

TI  == risk indicators for harboring periodontal pathogens.
AB  == the risk for harboring 6 putative periodontal pathogens in 4 selected periodontal pockets, in whole saliva, or in either site (i.e., orally) was determined in 52 caucasians, 49 african-americans, 48 asian-americans, and 50 hispanics living in  los angeles. 16s rrna pcr analysis assessed the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola. step-wise  regression analysis determined the relationship between the occurrence of each organism and various explanatory variables (risk indicators). periodontal probing depth or disease severity was positively associated with all 6 study organisms. african-americans carried an increased risk for harboring p. gingivalis in saliva (odds ratio [or] 2.95) and orally (or 2.66), and a reduced risk for harboring t.  denticola orally (or 0.34). asian-americans showed an increased risk for harboring a. actinomycetemcomitans in periodontal pockets (or 6.63) and p. gingivalis in periodontal pockets (or 5.39), in saliva (or 5.74), and orally (or  5.81). hispanics demonstrated an increased risk for harboring a. actinomycetemcomitans in periodontal pockets (or 12.27) and p. gingivalis in periodontal pockets (or 6.07), in saliva (or 8.72), and orally (or 7.98). age was positively associated with the prevalence of p. gingivalis in saliva (or 1.20) and orally (or 1.20), and of a. actinomycetemcomitans orally (or 1.18). the male  gender was a risk factor for harboring p. intermedia in periodontal pockets (or 2.40), in saliva (or 3.31), and orally (or 4.25), and for harboring p. nigrescens in saliva (or 2.85). the longer the subjects resided in the united states, the less likely a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected orally (or 0.82). former smokers demonstrated a decreased risk for harboring a. actinomycetemcomitans in saliva (or 0.23). current smokers displayed an increased risk for harboring t. denticola in periodontal pockets (or 4.61). the number of dental visits in the past 10 years was inversely related to the prevalence of p. intermedia orally (or 0.96). the prevalence of p. intermedia in saliva was positively associated with the length of time from the last dental visit (or 1.01). this study suggests that genetic and/or environmental factors predispose subjects to oral colonization by  putative periodontal pathogens.

AB  == the prevalence of 18 selected bacterial species was assessed by means of "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridisation in a group of 12 saudi-arabian adolescents with papillon-lefevre syndrome. a total of 36 tooth sites were investigated. the  patients exhibited severe periodontal disease with deep pockets. all 12 patients  harboured the putative bacterial pathogens p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, p. micros and s. intermedius while t. denticola, b. forsythus, p. nigrescens, e. corrodens, s. noxia and c. rectus were recovered from 11 patients. p. gingivalis was recovered from 9 patients and 18 sites while corresponding figures for a. actinomycetemcomitans were 8 and 19, respectively. a number of the investigated species (b. forsythus, t. denticola, p. intermedia, c rectus) reached high levels (> or =10(6) cells) in more than 1/2 of the patients. on the other hand, bacteria such as a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were infrequently encountered  at high levels in these subgingival samples. in conclusion, the analysis failed to demonstrate a pls-specific profile of the subgingival infection, since the bacterial composition of the sampled sites closely resembled that characterising  deep pockets in adult periodontitis patients.

TI  == the utility of whole saliva to detect the oral presence of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == this study compared the presence of 6 periodontopathic bacteria in whole saliva and subgingival plaque of 202 subjects. the test bacteria were identified using a 16s rrna-based pcr detection method. each study subject contributed a whole saliva sample and a paper point sample pooled from the deepest periodontal pocket in each quadrant of the dentition. the kappa test revealed a fair agreement between the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola in whole saliva and periodontal pocket samples (kappa > 0.4). the mcnemar test showed that the differences between sample types were due to a more frequent detection of the 3 organisms in whole saliva than in periodontal pocket samples (p < 0.01). prevotella nigrescens also was detected more frequently in whole saliva than in periodontal pocket samples (p < 0.01; mcnemar  test). although little agreement between samples was found for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus (kappa < or = 0.4), neither whole saliva nor pocket samples showed better detection for these 2 species (p < 0.01,  mcnemar test). the results indicate that whole saliva is superior to pooled periodontal pocket samples to detect p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, and t. denticola in the oral cavity. the detection of oral a. actinomycetemcomitans and b. forsythus with reasonably good accuracy may require  both whole saliva and periodontal pocket samples.

TI  == dental plaque flora of the dog with reference to fastidious and anaerobic bacteria associated with bites.
AB  == animal bite wounds are amongst the most common types of traumatic injuries in humans. the organisms isolated from these wounds generally reflect the oral flora of the biting animal, and may be fastidious in nature and difficult to identify.  this study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas and prevotella spp. in supragingival dental plaque collected from the right maxillary canine and carnassial teeth and the right mandibular canine tooth of dogs. in part one of the study, 30 dogs were used. e. corrodens was found in 62% of these dogs and 44% of individual plaque samples. a. actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any of the dogs sampled. in part two, 34 dogs were used to determine the prevalence of the black pigmented anaerobic bacilli (porphyromonas and prevotella spp.). porphyromonas gingivalis was present in 68% of these dogs and 47% of individual plaque samples. prevotella intermedia was present in 44% of the dogs and 23% of individual plaque samples. the recently described porphyromonas canoris, porphyromonas salivosa, porphyromonas cangingivalis, porphyromonas cansulci, porphyromonas crevioricanis and prevotella denticola species were isolated from only 9%, 6%, 3%, 3%, 3% and 3% of dogs respectively. porphyromonas gingivicanis was not isolated from any of the animals sampled. in conclusion, black-pigmented  anaerobic bacilli were isolated from 91% of the animals sampled and therefore constitute a significant risk with respect to bite wound infections. it is also suggested that the prevalence of e. corrodens in wound infections has been underestimated in previous reports because of use of inappropriate techniques for detecting this organism.

AB  == this study examined the effect of oral food consumption on the prevalence and levels of subgingival bacteria and yeasts in 20 gastrostomy tube-fed children and 24 healthy controls. microbial identification was carried out using anaerobic culture and 16s rrna-based pcr identification methods. streptococcal and actinomyces species were recovered from 100% and 76% of all subjects and averaged 66% and 11% of total cultivable organisms, respectively. in decreasing order of prevalence, fusobacterium, enteric rods, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga, propionibacterium, yeasts, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, and porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in 48% to 2% of the study subjects. the cultivable levels of these species varied widely among subjects. pcr detection showed c. rectus and eikenella corrodens both to occur in 93% of the study subjects and to be the most prevalent putative periodontal pathogens examined. in decreasing order of prevalence, pcr identified treponema denticola, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. nigrescens, p. intermedia, b. forsythus,  and p. gingivalis in 38% to 21% of the subjects studied. tube-fed children and healthy controls exhibited similar subgingival microbial compositions. it appears from this study that oral food consumption is not a major determinant for the establishment of subgingival microbiota in children.

TI  == putative periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque of young adults with and without early-onset periodontitis.
AB  == this study assessed the associations between putative periodontal pathogens and early-onset periodontitis (eop) in a population of 248 subjects, 13 to 19 years of age at baseline, derived from a representative sample of u.s. young adults. the subjects were selected based on the presence or absence of attachment loss at baseline. the attachment level was assessed clinically at baseline and at a 6-year follow-up examination, and the presence of 7 bacterial species was assessed at follow-up using dna probes. the individuals were classified into generalized, localized, incidental eop, and no-periodontitis groups based on the  extent and severity of attachment loss; and classified as having rapid, moderate, slow, and no progression based on the rate of periodontal progression during the  6 preceding years. in the eop groups there were significantly higher percentages  of individuals with detectable levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, and treponema denticola. in addition, the eop group had significantly higher levels of these 5  microorganisms compared to the no-periodontitis group. there were also higher percentages of individuals with these species and higher levels of bacteria in the group showing disease progression than the group without progression. in a descending order of importance, p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and p. intermedia were the microorganisms significantly associated with the generalized and/or rapidly progressing disease. f. nucleatum and c. rectus were also associated with eop, but to a lesser degree. in the present population actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was not significantly associated with eop, though it was recovered more often from subjects with localized eop. eikenella corrodens was present equally in subjects with and without disease. the results show that several bacterial species are associated with eop, and that p. gingivalis and t.  denticola are of particular importance and may play a significant role in the more severe and progressive forms of eop.

TI  == cross-infection from periodontitis sites to failing implant sites in the same mouth.
AB  == twenty-five tooth and implant sites in nine patients were investigated for the presence of putative periodontopathic organisms, using specific dna probes for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, and campylobacter recta. five of nine patients showed a likelihood of transmission from tooth to implant sites. these patients also showed a high number of putative periodontopathic organisms present in the tooth sites tested.  a significant risk was found of transmitting putative periodontopathic organisms  from periodontitis sites to implant sites in the same mouth. an appropriate clinical protocol needs to be developed to address this issue.

TI  == characterization of protease activities in capnocytophaga spp., porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema denticola and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == protease activities in cell sonicates of defined bacterial strains were examined  using peptide substrates and class-specific inhibitors. capnocytophaga spp. all produced serine dipeptidyl peptidase activity and arginine/lysine, elastase- and  chymotrypsin-like enzymes with some metalloprotease characteristics. the elastase-like activity was strongest in capnocytophaga sputigena, but the others  were greatest in capnocytophaga gingivalis. the latter also had a separate arginine-specific enzyme which appeared not to be present in the other two species. porphyromonas gingivalis showed serine dipeptidyl peptidase activity and very strong arginine and lysine cysteine protease activities. prevotella spp. had inhibitor-resistant dipeptidyl peptidase activity and arginine cysteine protease  activity that was much weaker but biochemically similar to p. gingivalis. treponema denticola possessed a strong trypsin-like serine protease activity as well as very weak dipeptidyl peptidase and chymotrypsin-like activities that were sensitive to some cysteine protease reagents. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans showed a novel alanine- and lysine-specific activity, but its nature was unclear.

TI  == the relationship between gingivitis and the serum antibodies to the microbiota associated with periodontal disease in children with down's syndrome.
AB  == gingival inflammation in down's syndrome children (ds) develops earlier and is more rapid and extensive than in non-ds children. abnormalities in host response  to the oral flora have been proposed as etiological factors of this gingival inflammation. however, the relationship between gingivitis and the host response  to oral microorganisms in ds by age has not been determined. the objective of this study was to clarify this relationship. sera were obtained from 75 ds subjects (aged 2 to 18 years) and their gingival health assessed using a modified pma index (m-pma). antibody titers to porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), treponema denticola (td), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), selenomonas sputigena (sel), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), and streptococcus mitis (mi) were determined using the micro-elisa. ds subjects under 4 years old were found to have significantly more gingival inflammation than did  normal children the same age. a significant positive correlation (r = 0.548, p <  0.0001) existed in the relationship between m-pma score and plaque score for subjects in the g1 age group (deciduous dentition). at g1, the average antibody titers to aa, mi, and fn exceeded those of the normal adult reference serum pool. in addition, igg antibody titers to pg, aa, fn, sel, and mi correlated significantly with the m-pma scores in the g1 age group. there was a correlation  between age (2 to 18 years) and these antibody titers. igg antibody titers to pg, aa, sel, and mi increased significantly with increasing m-pma score. furthermore, the igg antibody titers to pg were higher (p < 0.05) in the most extensive disease group compared to the ds no-disease group. the igg antibody titers to pg  at g3 (early puberty) were significantly higher when compared to g1 (preschool children). the igm antibody titers to aa at g3 were higher (p < 0.05) when compared to g1. this study suggests that colonization by aa and fn are closely associated with the onset of gingival inflammation in ds patients under 5 years old. colonization by pg, aa, sel, and mi in ds appears to be associated with gingivitis at puberty.

TI  == bacterial adherence to guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes exposed to the oral environment.
AB  == microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (gtr) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. the purpose of this study  was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). the study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. in each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (p1, p2, m1, m2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). these teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). a 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was  positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with  an external sling suture. with oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of  each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (a. actinomycetemcomitans, a. viscosus, b. melaninogenicus, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, s. mutans, s. sanguis, selenomonas sputigena, t. denticola, and t. vincentii) were present. semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (p < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. these results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.

TI  == microbial findings of deep peri-implant bone defects.
AB  == the objective of this study was to examine inflammatory tissue in deep peri-implant bone pockets (> 5 mm) for anaerobic bacteria colonization. the peri-implant inflammatory tissue of bone defects from 12 edentulous patients with 18 unsuccessful implants (imz type) was removed after surgical opening of the defects. after grinding the tissue with glass beads in nutrient solution, an aliquot of the suspension was plated and incubated on appropriate culture media.  the quantitative and qualitative distribution of bacteria as a function of the tissue dry weight was determined (cell count/mg dry weight). the mean total cell  count was 67 x 10(3) cells/mg dry weight. the following bacteria dominated: species of the family bacteroidaceae (prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, prevotella oralis, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella denticola); actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; fusobacterium nucleatum; capnocytophaga spp; and eikenella corrodens. bacteroidaceae and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were found particularly frequently. the increased colonization of these bacteria in deep peri-implant bone pockets is consistent with the currently held view of advanced periodontal lesions, whereby certain pathogens grow at a disproportionate rate in comparison with the total bacteria count under specific circumstances.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and treponema denticola detection in oral plaque samples using the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == detection of putative pathogens is critical for delineating the etiology and progression of periodontitis. in the present study, we have used a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay utilizing primers specific for the lkt a gene of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, the fimbrial gene of porphyromonas gingivalis, and tdp a gene of treponema denticola in order to determine the presence of these pathogens in subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis sites. these gene specific primers were also used to assess the detection of different strains of bacteria in the pcr assays. primers for p. gingivalis detected p. gingivalis strain 33277, but no product was detected when primers were used with extracts from 4 species of capnocytophaga, 3 species of prevotella, 2 species of porphyromonas other than p. gingivalis, bacteroides levii, escherichia coli, 3 strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans and 3 strains of t. denticola. pcr analysis using primers for the lkt a gene of a. actinomycetemcomitans also did not result in a product with any of these bacteria with the exception of a positive result with 3 different strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans. primers selected from the tdp a gene of t. denticola did not identify any of the bacteria strains tested except t. denticola serovars a, b, and c. thus, these primers were shown to amplify gene segments that are specific to either p. gingivalis (33277), a. actinomycetemcomitans (33384, 43717  and 43718) or t. denticola (35405, 33521 and 35404). the pcr assay may be used to rapidly detect the presence of periodontal pathogens in the future.

TI  == effect of initial therapy on dynamics of immunogloblin g levels to some periodontopathic bacteria in serum and gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the igg antibody levels to specific gram-negative periodontopathic bacteria in serum of 21 adult periodontitis patients and the gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) from 42 sites with destructive lesions and 21 healthy sites were evaluated before and after initial preparation. porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, treponema denticola and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in subgingival plaque samples from the patients were examined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. subgingival plaque, gcf, and serum samples were taken at baseline and three weeks after initial preparation. for 14 patients, changes in clinical parameters due to the initial preparation were correlated with reduction of periodontopathogens and to  igg antibody levels in gcf and serum against them. p. gingivalis, t. denticola and c. rectus were found to be predominant in destructive sites. no significant differences were found in gcf igg antibody levels between destructive and healthy sites. in destructive sites, the prevalence of p. gingivalis and c. rectus was significantly correlated with elevated igg antibody against these microorganisms  in gcf. the initial preparation resulted in significant reduction of serum igg antibody levels against all microorganisms tested. no decrease in gcf igg antibody was observed, but levels to p. gingivalis and c. rectus were significantly increased (p<0.05). the assessment of gcf igg antibodies to specific periodontopathic bacteria may be of considerable value in reflecting the conditions of periodontitis.

TI  == effect of proteolytic enzymes on the lysis and growth of oral bacteria.
AB  == previous studies have shown increased levels of proteolytic enzymes in affected periodontal sites. the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effect of proteolytic environments on the lysis and growth of selected oral bacteria associated with either healthy or diseased periodontal sites. the effect of trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase k on cell lysis was determined following  incubation with bacteria, whereas the effect of the same proteolytic enzymes on bacterial growth was tested using a disc-plate technique. overall, gram-positive  bacteria appeared to be more resistant to lysis than gram-negative bacteria. the  most susceptible bacteria were actinomyces spp., eubacterium saburreum, prevotella intermedia, capnocytophaga ochracea, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loescheii, treponema denticola and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the disc-plate procedure indicated that the growth of actinomyces spp., e. saburreum, c. ochracea, p. intermedia, p. loescheii, porphyromonas gingivalis and t. denticola were the most affected, more particularly by chymotrypsin and proteinase k. interestingly, the growth of f. nucleatum was rather stimulated by proteolytic enzymes. the observations reported in this investigation indicate that specific and general proteolytic activities have the ability to lyse some oral bacterial species and to interfere with their  growth. it is suggested that such effects could represent new mechanisms by which the bacterial ecology of subgingival sites may be affected.

TI  == dna probe detection of periodontopathogens in advanced periodontitis.
AB  == species-specific dna probes were used to determine the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis, prevotella  intermedia, treponema denticola, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, and wolinella recta in subgingival plaque from deep pockets/sites of patients with advanced periodontitis. the subjects were 20 patients with severe adult periodontitis, 13 men and 7 women (mean age 45.6 +/- 6.7 yr). for each subject, 9-10 subgingival sites with the deepest probing depths from each quadrant were sampled by the paper point method, a total of 198 sites, with mean probing depth  7.2 +/- 1.6 mm and clinical attachment level 9.5 +/- 2.7 mm. a.a. was present in  at least one site in 75% of the subjects; p. gingivalis was found in 95%; p. intermedia and w. recta were found in 90%, respectively; and t. denticola, e. corrodens, and f. nucleatum were found in all subjects. in the 198 samples, a.a.  was detected in 25.8%, p. gingivalis in 51.5%, p. intermedia in 64.1%, t. denticola in 60.6%, e. corrodens in 72.9%, f. nucleatum in 74.7%, and w. recta in 65.7%. the predominant combination was the simultaneous presence of p. intermedia, t. denticola, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, and w. recta in 89.5% of the subjects and 46.8% of the sites. of these sites, 51.1% showed the combined presence of p. gingivalis and 28.4% that of both a.a. and p. gingivalis. none of  the seven bacteria could be detected in 14.4% of the total sites sampled. the present study indicates that severe destructive adult periodontitis is a multibacterial infection and that certain combinations of periodontopathogens seem to be important in the pathogenesis of the disease.

TI  == configural frequency analysis for exploring bacterial sets in periodontal health  and disease.
AB  == periodontal research has been concerned with identifying bacterial sets in oral health and disease. configural frequency analysis (cfa) is a taxonomical method used to test the statistical significance of patterns of elementary cell frequencies in cross-tabulated data, and may therefore be used to evaluate interactions among occurrences and non-occurrences of periodontal microorganisms. cfa patterns may exist as configural types or anti-types depending on whether observed cell frequencies are greater or less than expected frequencies, respectively, based on table marginals. cfa was applied to two published data sets. in the first, the occurrence of bacteroides (porphyromonas) gingivalis (bg) and treponema denticola (td) was studied in military subjects. analysis of individual cells of the resultant two-by-two contingency table revealed the existence of a single anti-type (td in the absence of bg) suggesting a sequential phenomenon. the second, more complex, data set was based on reported occurrence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), bg, and bacteroides (prevotella) intermedius (bi) in sites with and without progressive periodontitis. cfa based on all data identified three statistically significant configural types and two anti-types. however, a somewhat different configurational picture emerged when disease progression status was considered a stratification variable for separate  analysis. all these analyses, which were undertaken for expository purposes, assumed independence of observations. methodological procedures are suggested for cfa when observations are not independent.

TI  == characterization of hemolytic bacteria in subgingival plaque.
AB  == three-quarters of the patients with periodontal diseases surveyed in this study had one or more distinct types of hemolytic bacteria in their subgingival plaque. twelve different species of bacteria were identified, belonging to five genera (actinomyces, streptococcus, staphylococcus, prevotella, and actinobacillus). nine hemolytic isolates, consisting of four prevotella denticola strains, two actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 strains, and one each of p. melaninogenica,  streptococcus constellatus, and a. naeslundii genospecies 1 strains were characterized. incorporation of pronase into blood agar medium inhibited hemolysis by all of the isolates, suggesting a proteinaceous component for each of their hemolysins. with one exception, hemolysin production appeared to be regulated by the concentration of environmental iron: exogenous hemin was found to inhibit hemolysin production, and the iron scavenging compound, 2,2'- dipyridyl, was found to promote hemolysin production by all of the strains except for the s. constellatus isolate. genomic libraries of each of the hemolytic plaque isolates were prepared in escherichia coli using pbr322. hemolytic clones  were isolated on blood agar medium containing ampicillin at frequencies ranging from 1-6.7 x 10(-4). extensive restriction mapping revealed regions of homology in the case of clones derived from three p. denticola strains isolated from the same subjects. two of the p. denticola-derived clones were virtually identical throughout the entrety of their > 5 kb inserts. the clone derived from the third  strain showed good homology to the other two within a 1.3 kb region, but the flanking dna showed no homology even though all three p. denticola isolates were  shown to be clonally related by ribotyping.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the effects of acacia arabica gum on the in vitro growth and protease activities  of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of acacia gum was assessed using fresh isolates and reference strains of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp., porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola. a fine aqueous suspension of gum was produced by sonication and then a soluble fraction  isolated by centrifugation and membrane filtration. these preparations were incorporated into columbia agar at doubling concentrations. growth of p. gingivalis and p. intermedia cultures on the agar was inhibited by whole gum sonicate at concentrations of 0.5-1.0% w/v. both species showed reduced susceptibility when horse blood was present in the agar. the gum soluble fraction did not inhibit growth of any bacterial culture. the effect of acacia on bacterial proteases was examined with cell sonicates from log phase broth cultures. enzyme activities were determined by fluorimetric assay with various synthetic peptide substrates. most protease activities reduced in the presence of 0.5% w/v gum sonicate, with the trypsin-like activities of p. gingivalis and p. intermedia proving most sensitive. the gum soluble fraction was nearly always less inhibitory than the sonicate. the action of acacia gum against suspected periodontal pathogens and their enzymes suggests that it may be of clinical value.
