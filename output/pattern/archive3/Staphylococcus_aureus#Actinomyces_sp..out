antimicrobial efficacy of ten commercially available herbal dentifrices against specific oral microflora - in vitro study.
aim: to determine and compare the antimicrobial efficacy of ten commercially available herbal dentifrices against specific strains of oral microflora using a standard diffusion method at full strength and 1:1 dilution at 24 h. materials and methods: the standard strains of streptococcus. mutans (atcc 21293), streptococcus sangius (mtcc 442), actinomyces viscosus (atcc 3268), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 2592), streptococcus pyogenes (mtcc 442) and candida albicans (atcc 183) were obtained. antimicrobial efficacy of the dentifrices was tested in triplicate, at full strength and 1:1 dilution with the sterile water using a standard diffusion method for 24 h at 37 degrees c. the antimicrobial efficacy was tested by observing the zones of inhibition in millimeters surrounding disk containing the dentifrice. mean standard deviation and standard error of mean of the inhibitory zones was calculated for each herbal dentifrice. p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. results: danth kanthi (dk) was the most effective against all the microorganisms producing larger zones of inhibition at 24 h (f.s - 40+/-1.5; 1:1 dilution - 40+/-2.71). amar premium (ap) also produced larger zones of inhibition against all microorganisms except s. aureus. of all the dentifrices, least zones of inhibitions i.e., around 5 mm was observed against s. aureus by amar premium (ap) and dabur babool (db) at 24 h. conclusion: based on the results of the present study, it can be concluded that all herbal dentifrices exhibited antimicrobial activity against the selected oral microorganisms, with dk being the most effective. hence, it can be inferred that herbal dentifrices can also be recommended like the conventional formulations.
anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial evaluation of neovestitol and vestitol isolated from brazilian red propolis.
the objective of this study was to evaluate anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities of neovestitol and vestitol isolated from brazilian red propolis (brp). brp ethanolic extract (eep), neovestitol, and vestitol were evaluated by anti-inflammatory properties using a neutrophil migration assay. the antimicrobial activity was evaluated by minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations (mic and mbc) against streptococcus mutans , streptococcus sobrinus , staphylococcus aureus , and actinomyces naeslundii . neovestitol, vestitol, and eep inhibited neutrophil migration at a dose of 10 mg/kg. regarding antimicrobial activity, neovestitol showed mics ranging from <6.25 to 25-50 mug/ml and mbcs ranging from 25-50 to 50-100 mug/ml, while vestitol showed mics ranging from 25-50 to 50-100 mug/ml and mbcs ranging from 25-50 to 50-100 mug/ml. both isoflavonoids neovestitol and vestitol are consistent bioactive compounds displaying anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities that can strongly act in a low dose and concentration and have a promising potential to be applied in the pharmaceutical and food industries.
identification of a bioactive compound isolated from brazilian propolis type 6.
a prenylated benzophenone, hyperibone a, was isolated from the hexane fraction of brazilian propolis type 6. its structure was determined by spectral analysis including 2d nmr. this compound exhibited cytotoxic activity against hela tumor cells (ic(50)=0.1756microm), strong antimicrobial activity (mic range-0.73-6.6microg/ml; mbc range-2.92-106microg/ml) against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus oralis, staphylococcus aureus, and actinomyces naeslundii, and the results of its cytotoxic and antimicrobial activities were considered good.
in vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. this study aimed to obtain recombinant hbd3 (rhbd3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of hbd3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. genetic engineering was used to obtain active rhbd3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals, including fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans. in an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rhbd3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. the ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. we conclude that hbd3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.
effect of porphyromonas gingivalis vesicles on coaggregation of staphylococcus aureus to oral microorganisms.
vesicles from the outer membrane of porphyromonas gingivalis have the ability to  aggregate a wide range of streptococcus spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces naeslundii, and actinomyces viscosus. we found that in the presence of p. gingivalis vesicles, staphylococcus aureus coaggregated with streptococcus spp., and the mycelium-type candida albicans, but not the yeast type. autoaggregation of s. aureus in the presence of p. gingivalis vesicles is inhibited by l-arginine, l-lysine, and l-cysteine. both the methicillin-sensitive (mssa) and -resistant (mrsa) strains of s. aureus were able to coaggregate with streptococcus spp., a. naeslundii, and a. viscosus when they were treated with p. gingivalis vesicles. p. gingivalis vesicle-treated mycelium-type c. albicans coaggregated with s. aureus, but the yeast-type did not. these results indicate that strains of s. aureus, including mrsa, could adhere to oral biofilms in dental plaque on the tooth surface or in the gingival crevice when p. gingivalis is present.
antimicrobial effect of six endodontic sealers: an in vitro evaluation.
the aim of this study was to determine the in vitro antimicrobial effect of six endodontic sealers after 2, 20 and 40 days. the sealers studied were apexit, endion, ah26, ah-plus. procosol and ketac endo. the microorganisms used were candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans and actinomyces israelii. petri dishes were filled with sterile agar and 0.1-ml wells were prepared and filled with the sealers. the agar plates were stored for 24 h at 37 degrees c. the samples were then removed, immersed in 4.5 ml of culture medium and divided into three groups. the samples in group 1 were stored for 2 days at 37 degrees c whereas the samples of groups 2 and 3 were stored at 4 degrees c for 20 and 40 days respectively. the samples were then removed and discarded, and 0.1 ml of the culture medium was seeded on the agar plates in order to perform colony forming unit counts. apexit, endion and ah-plus produced slight inhibition on streptococcus mutans at 20 days and on actinomyces israelii at every time interval. no effect was found on candida albicans and staphylococcus aureus. ketac endo only produced an antimicrobial effect on actinomyces israelii at 2 and 40 days. ah26 and procosol showed antimicrobial effect at 40 days on candida albicans, at 20 and 40 days on streptococcus mutans and staphylococcus aureus, and an effective inhibition on actinomyces israelii at every time interval. statistical analysis revealed both sealers and microorganisms to be significant factors affecting results in groups 2 and 3. in conclusion, the sealers evaluated in this study showed different inhibitory effects depending on time span. overall, sealers containing cugenol and formaldehyde proved to be most effective against the microorganisms at the time intervals studied.
effect of saccharin on growth and acid production of glucose-grown pathogenic and oral bacteria.
growth and acid production of glucose-grown gram-positive and gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02 to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. all gram-positive rods, i.e. actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis and corynebacterium diphtheriae, and gram-positive cocci, i.e. streptococcus spp, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. while gram-negative cocci, i.e. veillonella sp and neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. saccharin caused a significant reduction in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.
isolation, partial purification and preliminary characterization of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans rm-10.
an extracellular bactericidal substance was isolated from the supernatant of streptococcus mutans rm-10 culture fluid and partially purified with 60% ammonium sulfate precipitation, differential centrifugation, and gel filtration on sephadex g-200. there was a good correlation of the sensitivity profiles of indicator strains whether assayed on solid medium or with purified material from cell-free culture fluid, indicating that the same inhibitory substance is produced on solid medium and in broth. vapor from organic solvents such as chloroform, acetone, ethanol, and ether as well as heat treatment at 100 degrees c for 30 min had little effect on the bactericidal factor. it was sensitive to trypsin and pronase and resistant to deoxyribonuclease, ribonuclease, lysozyme, and phospholipase c. the inhibitor was not infective, and electron microscopic studies failed to reveal phage or phage-like particles in concentrated solutions of the bactericidal material. the results indicate that the extracellular bactericidal substance is indeed a bacteriocin. activity in broth cultures reached a maximum only after exponential growth had ceased. it was active against other streptococcal strains as well as strains of actinomyces naeslundii, a. viscosus, bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus, but not against strains of fusobacterium nucleatum and escherichia coli.
production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. these strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of staphylococcus aureus fda209p. the frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. strain iys2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. iys2 was identified to be s. aureus, based on its biological properties. the bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. the isoelectric point was 10.0. in amino acid composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. the bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. the bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. an analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that streptococcus salivarius, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium parvulum, and actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacterionema matruchotii, and bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. the majority of s. aureus tested were susceptible, and all staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.
