TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents - Special references to bacteria isolated between April 2011 and March 2012].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from April 2011 to March 2012 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 785 strains including 31 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 204 (78.8%) of 259 patients with surgical infections. Five hundred and twenty three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 231 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp., in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from surgical site infection, E. coli was most predominantly isolated, followed by P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and E. cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by Parvimonas micra, Collinsella aerofaciens, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, E. lenta was most predominantly isolated, followed by P micra and L. acidophilus, in this order. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroidesfragilis was the highest from primary infections, followed by Bilophila wadsworthia, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides uniformis and Bacteroides vulgatus, and from surgical site infection, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by Bacteroides caccae, B. thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus and B. wadsworthia, in this order. In this series, vancomycin-resistant MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa were not observed. We should carefully follow up B. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antimicrobial agents, and also Bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactams.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2009 and March 2010].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from April 2009 to March 2010 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 671 strains including 16 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 174 (79.1%) of 220 patients with surgical infections. Four hundred and eleven strains were isolated from primary infections, and 244 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp., and Staphylococcus spp. in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in this order, and from surgical site infection, E. coli was most predominantly isolated, followed by P. aeruginosa and E. cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by Parvimonas micra, Streptococcus constellatus and Finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, E. lenta was most predominantly isolated. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides ovatus and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and from surgical site infection, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by B. ovatus, B. wadsworthia and B. thetaiotaomicron, in this order. In this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci, nor multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa. We should carefully follow up B. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antibiotics, and also Bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of clinically relevant Gram-positive anaerobic cocci collected over a three-year period in the Netherlands.
AB  - The susceptibility of 14 species of 115 Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC) was  determined for 14 antibiotics. To assure correct identification, strains were genotypically identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization and sequencing. Susceptibility differences (MIC(5)(0) and MIC(9)(0)) for penicillin G, clindamycin, tigecycline, levofloxacin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefoxitin, ertapenem, meropenem, metronidazole, and doxycycline were found for the three clinically most relevant GPAC species: Finegoldia magna, Parvimonas micra, and Peptoniphilus harei.
TI  - Murdochiella asaccharolytica gen. nov., sp. nov., a Gram-stain-positive, anaerobic coccus isolated from human wound specimens.
AB  - Two strains of previously unknown Gram-stain-positive, anaerobic, coccus-shaped bacteria from human wound specimens were characterized using phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies and distinguishable biochemical characteristics demonstrated that these two unknown strains, WAL 1855C(T) and WAL 2038E, are genotypically homogeneous and constitute a novel lineage within Clostridium cluster XIII. There was 13-14 % 16S rRNA gene sequence divergence between the novel strains and the most closely related species, Parvimonas micra, Finegoldia magna and species of Helcococcus. Based on the phenotypic and phylogenetic findings, a novel genus and species, Murdochiella asaccharolytica gen. nov., sp. nov., are proposed. Strain WAL 1855C(T) (=ATCC BAA-1631(T) =CCUG 55976(T)) is the type strain of Murdochiella asaccharolytica.
TI  - European surveillance study on antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-positive anaerobic cocci.
AB  - Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC) are a heterogeneous group of microorganisms  frequently isolated from local and systemic infections. In this study, the antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical strains isolated in 10 European countries were investigated. After identification of 299 GPAC to species level, the minimum inhibitory concentrations of penicillin, imipenem, clindamycin, metronidazole, vancomycin and linezolid were determined by the agar dilution method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The majority of isolates were identified as Finegoldia magna and Parvimonas micra (formerly Peptostreptococcus micros), isolated from skin and soft tissue infections. All isolates were susceptible to imipenem, metronidazole, vancomycin and linezolid. Twenty-one isolates (7%) were resistant to penicillin (n=13) and/or to clindamycin (n=12). Four isolates were resistant to both agents. The majority of resistant isolates were identified as F. magna and originated from blood, abscesses and soft tissue infections.
TI  - Development of 16S rRNA-based probes for the identification of Gram-positive anaerobic cocci isolated from human clinical specimens.
AB  - Fluorescent probes targeted at 16S rRNA were designed for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Peptostreptococcus stomatis (Pana134), Parvimonas micra (Pamic1435), Finegoldia magna (Fmag1250), Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus (Pnasa1254), Peptoniphilus ivorii (Pnivo731), Peptoniphilus harei (Pnhar1466), Anaerococcus vaginalis (Avag1280) and Anaerococcus lactolyticus (Alac1438), based on the 16S rRNA sequences of reference strains and 88 randomly chosen clinical isolates. These strains were also used for validation of the probes. Application of the probes to an additional group of 100 clinical isolates revealed that 87% of Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC) could be identified with this set of probes. The 16S rRNAs of 13 clinical isolates that could not be identified were sequenced. Most of these isolates were GPAC that were not targeted by the probes. No clinical isolates of Pn. asaccharolyticus were encountered. Near full-length sequences were obtained from 71 of 101 (n = 88 + 13) sequenced clinical isolates. Of these, 25 showed <98% similarity with the homologues of the closest established species. The Fmag1250, Pamic1435, Pnhar1466, Pana134, Pnasa1254 and Pnivo731 probes allowed reliable identification and hybridised with all corresponding isolates. The Avag1280 and Alac1438 probes failed to hybridise with two isolates and one isolate, respectively, because of intra-species variation. However, overall, the set of probes yielded fast and reliable identification for the majority of clinical isolates.
