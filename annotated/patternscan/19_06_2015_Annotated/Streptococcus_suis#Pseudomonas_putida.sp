TI  == bacterial cell surface properties: role of loosely bound extracellular polymeric  substances (lb-eps).
AB  == this study investigated the effect of loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances (lb-eps) on the comprehensive surface properties of four bacteria (bacillus subtilis, streptococcus suis, escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida). the removal of lb-eps from bacterial surfaces by high-speed centrifugation (12,000xg) was confirmed by sem images. viability tests showed that the percentages of viable cells ranged from 95.9% to 98.0%, and no significant difference was found after treatment (p>0.05). ftir spectra revealed the presence of phosphodiester, carboxylic, phosphate, and amino functional groups on bacteria surfaces, and the removal of lb-eps did not alter the types of cell surface functional groups. potentiometric titration results suggested the total site concentrations on the intact bacteria were higher than those on lb-eps free bacteria. most of the acidity constants (pka) were almost identical, except the increased pka values of phosphodiester groups on lb-eps free s. suis and e. coli  surfaces. the electrophoretic mobilities and hydrodynamic diameters of the intact and lb-eps free bacteria were statistically unchanged (p>0.05), indicating lb-eps had no influence on the net surface charges and size distribution of bacteria. however, lb-esp could enhance cell aggregation processes. the four lb-eps free bacteria all exhibited fewer hydrophobicity values (26.1-65.0%) as compared to the intact cells (47.4-69.3%), suggesting the removal of uncharged nonpolar compounds (e.g., carbohydrates) in lb-eps. these findings improve our understanding of the changes in cell surface characterizations induced by lb-eps, and have important implications for assessing the role of lb-eps in bacterial adhesion and transport behaviors.
