TI  == exploring bacterial diversity of endodontic microbiota by cloning and sequencing  16s rrna.
AB  == introduction: the characterization of microbial communities infecting the endodontic system in each clinical condition may help on the establishment of a correct prognosis and distinct strategies of treatment. the purpose of this study was to determine the bacterial diversity in primary endodontic infections by 16s  ribosomal-rna (rrna) sequence analysis. methods: samples from root canals of untreated asymptomatic teeth (n = 12) exhibiting periapical lesions were obtained, 16s rrna bacterial genomic libraries were constructed and sequenced, and bacterial diversity was estimated. results: a total of 489 clones were analyzed (mean, 40.7 +/- 8.0 clones per sample). seventy phylotypes were identified of which six were novel phylotypes belonging to the family ruminococcaceae. the mean number of taxa per canal was 10.0, ranging from 3 to 21 per sample; 65.7% of the cloned sequences represented phylotypes for which no cultivated isolates have been reported. the most prevalent taxa were atopobium rimae (50.0%), dialister invisus, prevotella oris, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and tannerella forsythia (33.3%). conclusions: although several key species predominate in endodontic samples of asymptomatic cases with periapical lesions, the primary endodontic infection is characterized by a wide bacterial diversity, which is mostly represented by members of the phylum firmicutes belonging to the class clostridia followed by the phylum bacteroidetes.
