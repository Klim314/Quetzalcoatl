TI  == killing of neisseria gonorrhoeae, streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus), haemophilus ducreyi, and vaginal lactobacillus by 3-o-octyl-sn-glycerol.
AB  == the microbicide candidate octylglycerol inactivates sexually transmitted bacterial pathogens at concentrations which spare normal vaginal flora (lactobacillus). standard minimum microbicidal concentration assays and time-kill assays revealed the drug concentrations and times required for inactivation. octylglycerol concentrations must exceed the binding capacity of any human serum  albumin to be effective.

TI  == franksum: new feature selection method for protein function prediction.
AB  == in the study of in silico functional genomics, improving the performance of protein function prediction is the ultimate goal for identifying proteins associated with defined cellular functions. the classical prediction approach is  to employ pairwise sequence alignments. however this method often faces difficulties when no statistically significant homologous sequences are identified. an alternative way is to predict protein function from sequence-derived features using machine learning. in this case the choice of possible features which can be derived from the sequence is of vital importance to ensure adequate discrimination to predict function. in this paper we have successfully selected biologically significant features for protein function prediction. this was performed using a new feature selection method (franksum) that avoids data distribution assumptions, uses a data independent measurement (p-value) within the feature, identifies redundancy between features and uses an  appropriate ranking criterion for feature selection. we have shown that classifiers generated from features selected by franksum outperforms classifiers  generated from full feature sets, randomly selected features and features selected from the wrapper method. we have also shown the features are concordant  across all species and top ranking features are biologically informative. we conclude that feature selection is vital for successful protein function prediction and franksum is one of the feature selection methods that can be applied successfully to such a domain.

TI  == sialylation of group b streptococcal capsular polysaccharide is mediated by cpsk  and is required for optimal capsule polymerization and expression.
AB  == several bacterial pathogens have evolved the means to escape immune detection by  mimicking host cell surface carbohydrates that are crucial for self/non-self recognition. sialic acid, a terminal residue on these carbohydrates, inhibits activation of the alternate pathway of complement by recruiting the immune modulating molecule factors h, i, and ic3b. sialylation of capsular polysaccharide (cps) is important for virulence of group b streptococci (gbs), a  significant human pathogen. we previously reported that cpsk, a gene within the cps locus of type iii gbs, could complement a sialyltransferase deficient lst mutant of haemophilus ducreyi, implicating its role in sialylation of the gbs capsule. to explore the function of cpsk in gbs capsule production, we created a  mutant in cpsk. immunoblot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using anti-type iii cps antisera demonstrated that the mutant cps did not contain sialic acid. this was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography after mild acid hydrolysis of the cps. although increased cps chain length was seen for this strain, cps production was <20% of the parental isolate. an episomal cpsk copy restored synthesis of sialo-cps to wild-type levels. these data support our  hypothesis that cpsk encodes the gbs cps sialyltransferase and provide further evidence that lack of cps oligosaccharide sialylation reduces the amount of cps expressed on the cell surface. these observations also imply that one or more of  the components involved in synthesis or transport of oligosaccharide repeating units requires a sialo-oligosaccharide for complete activity.

TI  == cpsk of streptococcus agalactiae exhibits alpha2,3-sialyltransferase activity in  haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  == streptococcus agalactiae (gbs) is a major cause of serious newborn bacterial infections. crucial to gbs evasion of host immunity is the production of a capsular polysaccharide (cps) decorated with sialic acid, which inactivates the alternative complement pathway. the cps operons of serotypes ia and iii gbs have  been described, but the cps sialyltransferase gene was not identified. we identified cpsk, an open reading frame in the cps operon of most serotypes, which was homologous to the lipooligosaccharide (los) sialyltransferase gene, lst, of haemophilus ducreyi. to determine if cpsk might encode a sialyltransferase, we complemented a h. ducreyi lst mutant with cpsk. cpsk was expressed in h. ducreyi  and los was isolated and analysed for sialic acid content by sds-page and high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). sialo-los was seen in the wild-type, cpsk- or lst-complemented mutant strains, but not in the mutant without cpsk. addition of neu5ac to the los was confirmed by mass spectroscopy. lectin binding studies detected terminal neu5ac(alpha 2-->3)gal(beta 1- on los produced by the wild-type, cpsk or lst-complemented mutant strain los, compared with the mutant alone. our data characterize the first sialyltransferase gene from a gram- positive bacterium and provide compelling evidence that its product  catalyses the alpha2,3 addition of neu5ac to h. ducreyi los and therefore the terminal side-chain of gbs cps. phylogenetic studies further indicated that lst and cpsk are related but distinct from sialyltransferases of most other bacteria  and, along with their similar codon usage bias and g + c content, suggests acquisition by lateral transfer from an ancestral low g + c organism.
