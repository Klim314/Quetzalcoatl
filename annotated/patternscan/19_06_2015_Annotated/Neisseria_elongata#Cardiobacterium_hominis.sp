TI  == impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n  = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after  treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in  rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203,  pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia  dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated  with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI  == differentiation of some species of neisseriaceae and other bacterial groups by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == dna-dna hybridization using total genomic dna probes may represent a way of differentiating between miscellaneous bacterial species. this was studied with type and reference strains of 20 species in moraxella, kingella, and other selected gram-negative groups. both radioactive and biotin labelling were employed. most of the species examined were easily distinguished, such as moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, m.(b.) ovis, m. atlantae, m. phenylpyruvica, m. osloensis, neisseria elongata, n. meningitidis, kingella kingae, k. indologenes, k. dentrificans, oligella urethralis, eikenella corrodens, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus aphrophilus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, gardnerella vaginalis, and df-2. this reflected the extent of the genetic distances between them as a basis for identification by hybridization. there was some clustering in the moraxella group. especially the closely related moraxella nonliquefaciens, m. lacunata and m. bovis showed strong hybridization affinities. this leads to potential problems in distinguishing these three species from each other by dna-dna hybridization with total genomic probes alone.
