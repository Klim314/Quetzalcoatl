TI  == effects of a probiotic intervention in acute canine gastroenteritis--a controlled clinical trial.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the effect of a probiotic product in acute self-limiting  gastroenteritis in dogs. methods: thirty-six dogs suffering from acute diarrhoea  or acute diarrhoea and vomiting were included in the study. the trial was performed as a randomised, double blind and single centre study with stratified parallel group design. the animals were allocated to equal looking probiotic or placebo treatment by block randomisation with a fixed block size of six. the probiotic cocktail consisted of thermo-stabilised lactobacillus acidophilus and live strains of pediococcus acidilactici, bacillus subtilis, bacillus licheniformis and lactobacillus farciminis. results: the time from initiation of  treatment to the last abnormal stools was found to be significantly shorter (p =  0.04) in the probiotic group compared to placebo group, the mean time was 1.3 days and 2.2 days, respectively. the two groups were found nearly equal with regard to time from start of treatment to the last vomiting episode. clinical significance: the probiotic tested may reduce the convalescence time in acute self-limiting diarrhoea in dogs.

TI  == characterisation of is153, an is3-family insertion sequence isolated from lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and its use for strain differentiation.
AB  == an insertion sequence has been identified in the genome of lactobacillus sanfranciscensis dsm 20451t as segment of 1351 nucleotides containing 37-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. the sequence of this element encodes two out of phase, overlapping open reading frames, orfa and orfb, from which three putative proteins are produced. orfab is a transframe protein produced by -1 translational frame shifting between orf a and orf b that is presumed to be the transposase. the large orfab of this element encodes a 342 amino acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the is3 family. in l. sanfranciscensis type strain dsm 20451t multiple truncated is elements were identified. inverse pcr was used to analyze target sites of four of these elements, but except of their highly at rich character not any sequence specificity was identified so far. moreover, no flanking direct repeats were identified. multiple copies of is153 were detected by hybridization in other strains of l. sanfranciscensis. resulting hybridization patterns were shown to differentiate between organisms at strain level rather than a probe targeted against the 16s rdna. with a pcr based approach is153 or highly similar sequences were detected in l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. malefermentans, l. plantarum, l. hilgardii, l. collinoides l. farciminis l. sakei and l. salivarius, l. reuteri as well as in enterococcus faecium, pediococcus acidilactici and p. pentosaceus.

TI  == production of succinic acid from citric acid and related acids by lactobacillus strains.
AB  == a number of lactobacillus strains produced succinic acid in de man-rogosa-sharpe  broth to various extents. among 86 fresh isolates from fermented cane molasses in thailand, 30 strains (35%) produced succinic acid; namely, 23 of 39 lactobacillus reuteri strains, 6 of 18 l. cellobiosus strains, and 1 of 6 unidentified strains. all of 10 l. casei subsp. casei strains, 5 l. casei subsp. rhamnosus strains, 6 l. mali strains, and 2 l. buchneri strains did not produce succinic acid. among 58 known strains including 48 type strains of different lactobacillus species, the strains of l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. jensenii, and l. parvus produced  succinic acid to the same extent as the most active fresh isolates, and those of  l. alimentarius, l. collinoides, l. farciminis, l. fructivorans (1 of 2 strains tested), l. malefermentans, and l. reuteri were also positive, to lesser extents. diammonium citrate in de man-rogosa-sharpe broth was determined as a precursor of the succinic acid produced. production rates were about 70% on a molar basis with two fresh strains tested. succinic acid was also produced from fumaric and malic  acids but not from dl-isocitric, alpha-ketoglutaric, and pyruvic acids. the present study is considered to provide the first evidence on the production of succinic acid, an important flavoring substance in dairy products and fermented beverages, from citrate by lactobacilli.

TI  == [the microflora of sour dough. iv. communication: bacterial composition of sourdough starters genus lactobacillus beijerinck (author's transl)].
AB  == the bacterial composition of three so called pure culture sourdough starters of varying origin was investigated. 245 isolates were obtained all belonging to the  genus beijerinck. according to their morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics they were classified into the subgroups: thermobacterium (l. acidophilus), streptobacterium (l. casei, l. plantarum, l. farciminis, l. alimentarius) and betabacterium (l. brevis, l. brevis var. lindneri, l buchneri,  l. fermentum, l. fructi vorans). in the three sourdough starters the identified lactic organisms varied in number and proportion. in starter preparation "a" only the varieties l. fructi vorans and l. fermentum were present. preparation "b" contained a great variety of microorganisms with l. brevis and l. brevis l. lindneri predominating. in starter "c" l. brevis, l. plantarum and l. alimentarius predominated.
