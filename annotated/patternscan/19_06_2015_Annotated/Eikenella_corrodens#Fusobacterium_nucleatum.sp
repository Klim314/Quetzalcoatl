TI  == recovery of putative periodontal pathogens from curette sampling at different depths of periodontal lesions: an in vivo cross-sectional clinical study.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the depth of curette sample collection from periodontal lesions on the recovery of putative periodontal pathogens using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). methods: twenty-two periodontal pockets 6 to 8 mm deep with bleeding on probing at a single-rooted tooth were sampled, yielding 66 separate samples. curette samples were obtained at three different levels of the periodontal lesion (orifice, shallow--2 mm into the pocket; or base of lesion), and processed using pcr to identify 10 periodontal pathogens. the chi-square procedure was used to determine whether probe depth affected the distribution of bacterial counts observed. a repeated measures analysis of variance tested the hypotheses related to level of  probe and microorganism on mean rank of bacterial counts. results: the effect of  probe level on mean bacterial counts depends on the type of microorganism. likewise, the effect of microorganism type on mean bacterial counts significantly depends on probe level, where sampling from 2 mm into the periodontal pocket was  found to yield significantly higher results than sampling from the orifice. overall mean counts of pathogenic microorganisms were found to differ significantly across the three probe depths. the microorganisms differed in their observed levels over all three probe levels. further analysis found several significant differences that characterize the nature of the interaction between probe level and microorganism type. conclusion: there is significant difference in the amount of putative periodontal pathogens at varying depths of the pocket when sampled with a periodontal curette.

TI  == effects of adjunctive daily phototherapy on chronic periodontitis: a randomized single-blind controlled trial.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this randomized single-blind controlled trial was to elucidate the clinical and antimicrobial effects of daily phototherapy (pt) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (srp) in patients with chronic periodontitis. methods: the study was conducted from december 2013 to may 2014 at ewha womans university mokdong hospital, seoul, korea. forty-one patients with mild to moderate chronic periodontitis were randomly divided into two therapeutic groups  in a 1:1 ratio: srp+pt and srp (control) groups. all participants underwent full-mouth srp. pt was performed thrice a day for a month by using electric toothbrushes with embedded light-emitting diodes. plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depth (ppd), clinical attachment level (cal), and bleeding on probing were assessed before (baseline) and four weeks after (follow-up) the treatment. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus levels were detected by a real-time polymerase chain reaction at the same points in time. results: the clinical parameters improved in both the groups. at the follow-up assessment, ppd was significantly decreased in the srp+pt group (p=0.00). further, ppd and cal showed significantly greater changes in the srp+pt group than in the srp group (ppd, p=0.03; cal, p=0.04). p. gingivalis and t. forsythia levels decreased in this group, but no significant intergroup differences were noted. conclusions: adjunctive pt seems to have clinical benefits, but evidence of its antimicrobial  effects is not sufficient. long-term studies are necessary to develop the most effective pt protocol and compare the effectiveness of pt with and without exogenous photosensitizers.

TI  == microbial leakage at the implant/abutment connection due to implant insertion maneuvers: cross-sectional study 5 years post loading in healthy patients.
AB  == abstract the aim of this study was to test if stress on the prosthetic connection during insertion maneuvers can induce micro-warping at the implant-connection. from sept 2011 to july 20134, patients with implants loaded at least 5 years that were placed with two different insertion implant mounters - mp (conventional) and me (mountless) - were selected from all those that had received dental implant therapy in the past and coming to routine check-up or spontaneous visits during the study period. patients having implants loaded at least 5 years that were placed with two different insertion implant mounters - mp (conventional) and me (mountless) - were recruited. samples were obtained from inside the connection and the abutment surface (cias) using absorbent sterile paper tips. qrt-pcr was performed for total bacterial counts and loads of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythensis (tf), treponema denticola (td), prevotella intermedia (pi), peptostreptococcus micros (pm), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), campylobacter rectus (cr), eikenella corrodens (ec), and candida albicans (ca). the anova test  was used to test for differences. nine patients (20 implants, mp group) and 5 patients (10 implants, me group) were included. regarding the red complex, tf was seen in 80% and 30% of mp and me implants respectively (p<0.001). significant differences were also found in microbial load. for td, proportions were 45% vs. 10% (p=0.022) with no significant differences at load levels. regarding the orange complex, higher prevalence values were found in mp implants, although differences were non-significant. microbial load levels for orange complex bacteria were higher for mp than me, being these differences statistically significant for fn (4.94 vs 3.09; p=0.001). finally, ec was only detected in the  mp group, and ca and aa were not found in either group. within its limitation (small sample size, retrospective analysis, indirect measurement method), the present study suggest that aa mounter not impacting on the prosthetic connection  should be used to reduce microbial contamination of implants.

TI  == relationship of clinical and microbiological variables in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and periodontitis.
AB  == background: the aim of the study was to analyze how metabolic control of type 1 diabetes is related to clinical and microbiological periodontal parameters. material and methods: the study involved 56 subjects aged from 19 to 50 years divided into 2 groups: healthy subjects (the h group), and diabetic (type 1 diabetes) patients with chronic untreated generalized periodontitis (the dm group). the glycosylated hemoglobin value (hba1c) was determined using the unicel dxc 800 synchron system (beckman coulter, usa), and the concentration in blood was measured by the turbidimetric immunoinhibition method. a molecular genetic assay (micro-ident plus, germany) was used to detect periodontopathogenic bacteria in plaque samples. periodontitis was confirmed by clinical and radiological examination. results: fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga species, and eikenella corrodens were the most frequently found bacteria in dental plaque samples (77.8%, 66.7%, and 33.4%, respectively), whereas aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was identified 40.7% less frequently in the dm group than in the h group. the strongest relationship was observed between the presence of 2 periodontal pathogens - f. nucleatum and capnocytophaga spp. - and  poorer metabolic control in type 1 diabetes patients (hba1c) and all clinical parameters of periodontal pathology. conclusions: periodontal disease was more evident in type 1 diabetic patients, and the prevalence of periodontitis was greatly increased in subjects with poorer metabolic control.

TI  == influence of highly-active antiretroviral therapy on the subgingival biofilm in hiv-infected patients.
AB  == aim: highly-active antiretroviral therapy (haart) has been associated with alterations in subgingival biofilm and periodontal disease. the purpose of the present study was to investigate the association between different haart regimens and the prevalence of periodontal pathogens in hiv-infected patients with chronic periodontitis. methods: subgingival periodontal pathogens were determined by a dna chip microarray in a case series in 14 hiv-infected patients receiving haart  with different drug combinations: protease inhibitor (pi)-based haart versus non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (nnrti)-based haart. a statistical analysis was conducted to determine whether specific haart regimens were associated with 10 periodontal pathogens using odds ratios (or). results: at baseline and after treatment, the patients did not show significant clinical and  immunological differences. in general, the highest or for the prevalence of periodontal pathogens were found in the pi haart group for actinomyces viscosus (a. viscosus) (or: 303), campylobacter rectus (or: 90), and treponema denticola (or: 25). in the nnrti haart group, higher or were documented for fusobacterium nucleatum (or: 56) and eikenella corrodens (or: 25). the association between a. viscosus and pi haart was statistically significant (p = 0.03). conclusions: the  results demonstrated statistical associations between subgingival bacteria and antiretroviral drug therapies. further investigation on the clinical significance and underlying mechanisms are needed to support these findings.

TI  == real-time pcr quantification of six periodontal pathogens in saliva samples from  healthy young adults.
AB  == objective: the use of saliva as a diagnostic fluid for the evaluation of periodontal health has gained attention recently. most published real-time pcr assays focused on quantification of bacteria in subgingival plaque, not in saliva. the aims of this study were to develop a real-time pcr assay for quantification of six periodontal pathogens in saliva and to establish a relationship between the amount of dna (fg) and colony-forming unit (cfu). materials and methods: taqman primers/probe sets were used for the detection of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), eikenella corrodens (ec), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), tannerella forsythia (tf), and total bacteria. six periodontal pathogens and total bacteria in saliva from 24 periodontally healthy individuals  were determined. the relationship between the amount of dna (fg) and cfu was established by measuring the concentrations of extracted bacterial dna and cfu per milliliter of bacteria on agar plates. results: fn, ec, and pi were detected  in all saliva samples, while 58.5, 45.8, and 33.3% were detected for tf, pg, and  aa, respectively. numbers of ec and fn in saliva were highly correlated (r(2) = 0.93, p < 0.01). the values of dna (fg) per cfu ranged from 64 for ec to 121 for  pg. conclusion: the real-time pcr assay in combination with the relationship between dna (fg) and cfu can be used to quantitate periodontal pathogens in saliva and estimate the number of live bacteria (cfu). clinical relevance: this real-time pcr assay in combination with the relationship between dna (fg) and cfu has the potential to be an adjunct in evaluation of periodontal health status.

TI  == combinatorial effects of amoxicillin and metronidazole on selected periodontal bacteria and whole plaque samples.
AB  == objective: the aim of the present study was to analyze in vitro the combinatorial effects of the antibiotic combination of amoxicillin plus metronidazole on subgingival bacterial isolates. design: aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum  and eikenella corrodens from our strain collection and subgingival bacteria isolated from patients with periodontitis were tested for their susceptibility to amoxicillin and metronidazole using the etest. the fractional inhibitory concentration index (fici), which is commonly used to describe drug interactions, was calculated. results: synergy, i.e. fici values </= 0.5, between amoxicillin and metronidazole was shown for two a. actinomycetemcomitans (fici: 0.3), two f.  nucleatum (fici: 0.3 and 0.5, respectively) and one e. corrodens (fici: 0.4) isolates. indifference, i.e. fic indices of >0.5 but </=4, occurred for other isolates and the 14 p. intermedia/nigrescens strains tested. microorganisms resistant to either amoxicillin or metronidazole were detected in all samples by  etest. conclusion: combinatorial effects occur between amoxicillin and metronidazole on some strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and e. corrodens. synergy was shown for a few strains only.

TI  == an endodontic-periodontal lesion with primary periodontal disease: a case report  on its bacterial profile.
AB  == the microflora in the periodontal pockets can affect the dental pulp and cause endodontic-periodontal lesions or retrograde pulpitis. here we report an endodontic-periodontal lesion together with its bacterial profile. the lesion occurred in the maxillary right first molar of a 40-year-old woman who presented  at our hospital complaining of a violent toothache since the previous night. clinically, the tooth was caries-free and an electric pulp test showed it to be vital. the tooth showed signs of advanced periodontitis and the periodontal pocket was deep, reaching the apex of the palatal root. the clinical diagnosis was an endodontic-periodontal lesion with primary periodontal disease. subsequent endodontic treatment comprised pulp extirpation and root canal filling, followed  by periodontal treatment consisting of scaling and root planing. the tooth was finally restored with a full metal crown. no further signs of periodontal disease or periapical lesions have been observed to date. bacteria were sampled from the  root canal and periodontal pocket for a microbiological assessment using 16s rrna gene-based pcr. microbiologically, the profile of the bacterial species from the  palatal root canal was similar to that from the periodontal pocket of the palatal root. porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and eikenella corrodens were detected in both samples. the occurrence of bacteria common to both sites in this patient further supports the proposition that periodontal disease is the definitive source of root canal infections. the present results suggest that a bacterial examination would be helpful in confirming and supporting the clinical  diagnosis in such lesions.

TI  == microbiological assessment of the implant-abutment interface in different connections: cross-sectional study after 5 years of functional loading.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the bacterial microflora present inside the implant connection and in the peri-implant sulcus fluid of healthy implants, and to analyze the relationships between these harboring sites for four different implant systems after at least 5 years of functional loading. materials and methods: a cross-sectional study was performed involving 40 patients treated with metal-ceramic cemented bridges supported by at least two healthy implants functionally loaded for 5 years. four different implant-abutment connections were studied: external hexagon (control group), double internal hexagon (test group 1), internal hexagon with external collar (test group 2), and conical connection  (test group 3). samples for microbiological analysis were obtained from three types of sites: peri-implant sulci, connections' inside and abutments surface and, as control, gingival sulci of neighboring teeth. quantitative real-time pcr  was carried out for total bacterial count and for 10 microorganisms: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, and candida albicans. the response variables were percentage of positive sites and absolute bacterial load. the relations of the response variables with the type of connection and of sampling site were assessed using generalized estimating equations. results: regarding the analysis of positivity to bacteria in the peri-implant sulcus no significant differences were observed. analyzing the connection's inside, none of the connection designs had the capacity to prevent microbiological leakage through the implant/abutment microgap. test group 3 presented the lowest mean values for red complex bacteria and control group the highest, although differences were non-significant. statistical significance was  only reached for treponema denticola in the bacterial load analysis inside the connection. test groups 1 and 2 yielded lower values for orange complex bacteria  but only for peptostreptococos micros the differences resulted significant. test  groups 2 and 3 had significantly lower total bacterial counts in the peri-implant sulcus and inside the connection. conclusions: outcomes suggested that all the analyzed connections resulted contaminated after 5 years of functional loading. however, the connection design might influence bacterial activity levels qualitatively and quantitatively, especially inside the implant connection.

TI  == the effects of stress hormones on growth of selected periodontitis related bacteria.
AB  == the focus of this study was to examine in vitro the effects of stress hormones (catecholamines: epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine and hydrocortisone: cortisol) on the growth of four anaerobic species of periodontitis-related bacteria (fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythia) and one facultative anaerobic species (eikenella corrodens). bacterial growth was determined by two different methods:  fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish), and the viable count by culture method. to simulate stress, each single strain was grown in a special growth medium with three different concentrations of each hormone, using an anaerobic chamber at 37 degrees c. growth of f. nucleatum increased in the presence of all  stress hormones. growth of p. gingivalis was not significantly influenced by any  hormone. growth of p. intermedia and e. corrodens was inhibited by almost all stress hormones tested. both methods of analysis revealed that the highest concentrations of norepinephrine and cortisol increased the growth of t. forsythia. different hormones have a different effect on the growth of periodontitis-related bacteria in vitro. it appears that bacterial viability is more strongly influenced than is bacterial metabolic activity. the growth of f. nucleatum particularly and partially of t. forsythia is increased by several stress hormones and may have an additional negative impact on periodontal disease.

TI  == efficacy of a new mouth rinse formulation based on 0.07% cetylpyridinium chloride in the control of plaque and gingivitis: a 6-month randomized clinical trial.
AB  == aim: to assess the efficacy of a 0.07% cetylpyridinium chloride (cpc) mouth rinse in the control of plaque and gingival inflammation during a 6-month period. material and methods: adult subjects with moderate gingivitis were selected [>/=40% bleeding on marginal probing (bomp)]. after retrieving microbiological samples and evaluating the clinical parameters (plaque, bomp and stain indexes),  a professional prophylaxis was performed and subjects were randomly assigned to the test (cpc mouth rinse) or to the placebo group. subjects were re-assessed after 3 and 6 months. results: a total of 67 patients (35 test, 32 placebo) were  included in the analysis. at 6 months, intra-group significant plaque reductions  were observed in the test group (0.691, p < 0.001), but not in the placebo (0.181, p = 0.653). at 6 months, the mean bomp values were lower in the test group (p = 0.052). changes between baseline and 6 months were significantly higher in the test group both for plaque (p = 0.002) and bomp (p = 0.037) when compared with the placebo. a microbiological impact was observed in the test group, especially for prevotella intermedia. conclusion: the evaluated 0.07% cpc-based mouth rinse, used three times per day adjunctively to mechanical tooth  cleaning, prevents plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation, as compared to  the placebo, for at least 6 months.

TI  == evaluation of periodontal pathogens in amniotic fluid and the role of periodontal disease in pre-term birth and low birth weight.
AB  == background: pre-term birth and/or low birth weight (ptlbw) is a serious problem in developing countries. the absence of known risk factors in approximately 50% of ptlbw cases has resulted in a continued search for other causes. the aim of this study was to examine the effect of periodontitis on pregnancy outcomes. methods: samples were taken from 50 pregnant women who underwent amniocentesis. polymerase chain reaction was performed on amniotic fluid samples obtained during amniocentesis and on subgingival plaque samples to determine the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia,  campylobacter rectus and eikenella corrodens. plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on probing, probing depth and clinical attachment level were evaluated.  medical records were obtained after birth. results: social and demographic variables were similar among the gingivitis (g), localized periodontitis (lp) and generalized periodontitis (gp) groups. four subjects gave birth to ptlbw neonates. campylobacter rectus, t. forsythia, p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum were detected in the amniotic fluid and subgingival plaque samples of three patients who gave birth to ptlbw neonates. the amniotic fluid sample from the fourth patient was not positive for any of the tested pathogens. conclusion: these findings suggest that the transmission of some periodontal pathogens from the oral cavity of the mother may cause adverse pregnancy outcomes. the results contribute to an understanding of the association between periodontal disease and ptlbw, but further studies are required to better clarify the possible relationship.

TI  == association between periodontal status and pre-term and/or low-birth weight in spain: clinical and microbiological parameters.
AB  == background and objective: studies performed over the last 15 years have suggested that periodontal diseases may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. however, this association has not been found in all populations. the aim of this  study was to evaluate whether periodontal status and the presence of specific periodontal pathogens may influence the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes.  material and methods: pregnant women were clinically examined before 26th week of gestation, and divided in two groups: non-periodontitis and periodontitis. microbial samples were obtained in the periodontitis group and processed by anaerobic culturing. after delivery, data on the pregnancy outcome were taken; mother's socio-demographic and risk factors were obtained at inclusion. simple and multiple regression analysis were performed. results: one hundred and seventy women were included in the study (116 non-periodontitis and 54 with periodontitis). the incidence of preterm (ptb) and low-birth weight (lbw) was 2.94% and 3.53%, respectively. periodontal status did not show any association with adverse pregnancy outcomes. the presence of eikenella corrodens was significantly related to ptb (p = 0.022) and the presence capnocytophaga spp. was related to lbw (p = 0.008). the multivariate analyses showed a significant association between ptb and newborn weight and counts of e. corrodens. maternal health and counts of e. corrodens were significantly associated with ptb or lbw.  conclusion: the clinical periodontal condition was not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes in a spanish caucasian population with medium-high educational level. the presence and counts of e. corrodens and the presence of capnocytophaga spp. showed a significant association with ptb and lbw, respectively, in the bivariate and/or multivariate model.

TI  == subgingival biodiversity in subjects with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes and chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: there is a bidirectional relationship between periodontal disease and type-2 diabetes mellitus (dm). inflammatory mediators may negatively affect glycemic control, and increased glucose levels and resultant glycation end-products may alter the host response against bacterial infection. however, no agreement has been reached regarding the effect of dm on periodontal  subgingival microbiota. therefore, the purpose of the present study was to compare the subgingival biodiversity in deep periodontal pockets of subjects with chronic periodontitis and either uncontrolled type-2 diabetes or no diabetes using 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing. material and methods: twelve subjects with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes (glycated hemoglobin > 8%) and eleven nondiabetic subjects presenting severe and generalized chronic periodontitis were selected. subgingival biofilm from periodontal pockets > 5 mm were assessed using the 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing technique. results: significant differences were observed in subgingival microbiota between diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. diabetic subjects presented higher percentages of total clones of tm7, aggregatibacter, neisseria, gemella, eikenella, selenomonas, actinomyces, capnocytophaga, fusobacterium, veillonella and streptococcus genera, and lower percentages of porphyromonas, filifactor, eubacterium, synergistetes, tannerella and treponema genera than nondiabetic individuals (p < 0.05). moreover, some phylotypes, such as fusobacterium nucleatum, veillonella parvula,  v. dispar and eikenella corrodens were detected significantly more often in diabetic subjects than in nondiabetic subjects (p < 0.05). conclusion: subjects with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes and chronic periodontitis presented significant dissimilarities in subgingival biodiversity compared with nondiabetic subjects.

TI  == subgingival microbiota from cebus apella (capuchin monkey) with different periodontal conditions.
AB  == this present study evaluated the subgingival microbiota of the cebus apella with  different periodontal conditions kept by the tufted capuchin monkey procreation center (sao paulo state university - unesp) or free-ranging monkeys. for this purpose, clinical specimens of subgingival biofilm were collected from 52 monkeys, of both genders, 40 kept in captivity and 12 free-ranging monkeys. the primates were submitted to periodontal evaluation and biofilm samples were transferred to vmga iii transport medium and ultrapure water. the microbiota was  cultivated in selective and non-selective culture media and microbial dna was extracted and the presence of periodontal pathogens was evaluated using pcr and real-time pcr. the actinomycetes, fusobacteria, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobic rods, tannerella forsythia, staphylococci and streptococci represent the predominantly detected microorganisms. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, dialister pneumosintes and prevotella nigrescens were rarely observed, whereas treponema denticola was not found. populations of c. rectus, e. corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia and the total microbial load were significantly higher in animals with bone loss and, in smaller extension, in animals with gingival bleeding.

TI  == a microbiological profile of unexposed and exposed pulp space of primary endodontic infections by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to evaluate, by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization, the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in cases associated with exposed (n = 30) and unexposed (n = 30) pulp space. methods: samples were collected by means of a #15 h-type file and 2 sterile paper points from 60 single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp and periapical lesions. the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: the species found in higher counts (x10(5)) in exposed pulp space cases were eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii, tannerella forsythia, enterococcus faecalis, neisseria  mucosa, campylobacter gracilis, and prevotella nigrescens, and in unexposed pulp  space cases they were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, n. mucosa, e. faecalis, e. saburreum, c. gracilis, and porphyromonas gingivalis. counts of f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, campylobacter sputigena, capnocytophaga showae, treponema socrenskii,  porphyromonas endodontalis, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga ochracea were significantly higher in unexposed pulp space cases (p < .05). conclusions: the data of the present investigation suggested specific differences between the composition of the microbiota in cases with exposed and unexposed pulp space and  an association between higher levels of some specific species and unexposed pulp  space cases.

TI  == adjunctive azithromycin in the treatment of aggressive periodontitis: microbiological findings of a 12-month randomized clinical trial.
AB  == objectives: to compare the subgingival microbiological outcomes of azithromycin or placebo as adjuncts to scaling and root planing (srp) in the treatment of aggressive periodontitis (agp), and to secondarily evaluate the microbiological effect of supragingival scaling in agp patients. methods: twenty-four agp subjects 13-26 years of age received a 15-day programme of supragingival scaling  (sc) and were then randomly assigned to srp with systemic azithromycin or placebo. subgingival samples were taken with sterile paper points at baseline, 15 days after sc, and at 3, 6 and 12 months following srp. microbiological analysis  was performed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: changes in bacterial levels from baseline to 15 days after sc were similar in the 2 groups.  when subjects were analysed as a single group, significant reductions after sc were observed for actinomyces gerencseriae, capnocytophaga ochracea, and treponema denticola. during the 12-month follow-up, levels of most of the bacteria decreased in both groups in a similar pattern. for instance, actinomyces israelli, veillonella parvula, streptococcus gordonii, c. ochracea, eikenella corrodens, eubacterium nodatum, fusobacterium periodonticum and fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum decreased significantly within the groups. conclusions: azithromycin was ineffective in lowering the subgingival levels of important putative periodontal pathogens in young agp subjects compared to placebo. clinical significance: scaling and root planing with adjunctive systemic azithromycin provides little additional benefit compared to placebo in reductions of major subgingival periodontal pathogens.

TI  == comparison of microbial changes in early redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.
AB  == background: surfaces and fluids can affect oral bacterial colonization. the aim of this study is to compare redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.  methods: supragingival plaque samples were taken from 55 dentate individuals and  the denture teeth of 62 edentulous individuals before and after professional cleaning. also, samples from seven "teeth" (samples included dentures) in randomly selected quadrants were collected after 1, 2, 4, and 7 days of no oral hygiene. samples were analyzed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. counts and proportions of 41 bacterial taxa were determined at each time point, and significant differences were determined using the mann-whitney u test. ecological succession was determined using a modified moving window analysis. results: mean  total dna probe counts were similar precleaning but were higher in dentate individuals at all post-cleaning visits (p <0.01). precleaning edentate biofilms  had higher counts and proportions of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus mutans, whereas dentate individuals had higher proportions of tannerella forsythia, selenomonas noxia, and neisseria mucosa. by day 2, mean counts of all taxa were higher in natural teeth, and most remained higher at day  7 (p <0.01). succession was more rapid and complex in dentate individuals. both groups demonstrated increased proportions of s. mitis and s. oralis by day 1. n.  mucosa, veillonella parvula, and eikenella corrodens increased in both groups, but later in samples from edentate individuals. conclusions: "mature" natural and denture teeth biofilms have similar total numbers of bacteria but different species proportions. post-cleaning biofilm redevelopment is more rapid and more complex on natural teeth than on denture teeth.

TI  == anaerobic and microaerophilic pathogens in the biofilm formation on voice prostheses: a pilot study.
AB  == objectives/hypothesis: voice rehabilitation with voice prostheses is a standard therapy in laryngectomized patients. biofilm formation on the surface of the voice prostheses causes device failure and requires frequent replacements. studies analyzing the biofilm of voice prostheses have mainly focused on aerobic  bacteria. anaerobic bacteria as an integral part of the biofilms on voice prostheses have not been investigated yet. study design: prospective pilot study  on the occurrence of anaerobic and microaerophilic pathogens in biofilm formation on voice prostheses. methods: biofilm samples of 15 voice prostheses were analyzed using a polymerase chain reaction-based hybridization method regarding the presence of 11 selected anaerobic and microaerophilic pathogens. results: in  80% of the voice prostheses, at least one and up to 10 of the tested bacteria could be identified. fusobacterium nucleatum was the pathogen most often present  (73%). other frequently occurring pathogens were treponema denticola (40%), tannerella forsythia (33%), and eikenella corrodens (33%). there was no correlation between the number of identified bacteria and the indwelling times (mean, 127 days; maximum, 344 days; minimum, 22 days). conclusions: for the first time, anaerobic and microaerophilic pathogens have been identified as part of the biofilm formation on the surface of voice prostheses. those pathogens might be responsible for accelerated biofilm formation and reduced lifetime of the voice prostheses.

TI  == investigation of six selected bacterial species in endo-periodontal lesions.
AB  == aim: to investigate and determine possible associations of six tested bacteria belonging to 'orange' and 'green' complexes, in endo-periodontal lesions: parvimonas micra, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium nodatum, eikenella corrodens and capnocytophaga sputigena. methodology: forty-six patients presenting with different types of endo-periodontal lesions were investigated. clinical examinations, periapical radiographs and microbiological sampling from the canal system (endo) and periodontal pockets (perio) were performed. qualitative and semiquantitative evaluation of bacteria was performed  by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and dna-dna hybridization (micro-ident plus; hain lifescience, germany). results: extremely high bacterial loads in endodontic samples were recorded for p. micra, f. nucleatum and c. sputigena, while periodontal samples were often colonized by the same species, plus c. rectus. significant association was recorded between f. nucleatum-endo and p. micra-endo  (p = 0.03, fisher's exact test). there was marginal evidence of associations between: (i) c. sputigena-endo and c. sputigena-perio (p = 0.06, fisher's exact test); (ii) p. micra-endo and p. micra-perio (p = 0.05, fisher's exact test). sensitivity to percussion was associated with an increased chance of cases with p. micra-endo (p = 0.03, pearson chi-square test). conclusion: the findings suggest that f. nucleatum, p. micra and c. sputigena may play a role in the pathogenesis of endo-periodontal lesions.

TI  == short-term periodontal and microbiological changes following orthognathic surgery.
AB  == objective: aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of orthognathic surgery on the development of periodontal and microbiological changes. materials  and methods: fifteen consecutively treated patients with a mean age of 24.9+/-7.7 years receiving orthognathic surgery were included in the present study. plaque index (pi) and concentrations of 11 periodonto-pathogenic bacteria were recorded  one day prior to surgery (t(0)) and one week (t(1)) and six weeks (t(2)) post-surgery. in addition, a complete periodontal examination including pocket probing depth (ppd), gingival recession (gr), clinical attachment level (cal), bleeding on probing (bop) and width of keratinized gingiva (wkg) was conducted at t(0) and t(2). for statistical analysis, general linear model and paired t-test were applied. results: a significant increase of pi (t(0)-t(1), p=0.037) was followed by a significant decrease (t(1)-t(2), p=0.017). apart from eikenella corrodens (p=0.036), no significant microbiological changes were recorded. ppd significantly increased on oral sites (p=0.045) and gr especially on buccal sites (p=0.001). in the incision area the development of gr was significantly higher on the test (buccal) than on the control sites (oral). both gingival biotypes were affected by gr. conclusions: orthognathic surgery causes statistically significant changes of periodontal parameters, but these changes do not necessarily impair the aesthetic appearance of the gingival margin.

TI  == [prevalence of helicobacter pylori detected by real-time pcr in the subgingival plaque of patients with chronic periodontitis].
AB  == background: helicobacter pylori plays a significant role in gastric disease. the  aim of the present pilot study was to evaluate the prevalence of h. pylori detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time pcr) in the sub-gingival plaque of chronic periodontitis patients and to determine periodontopathogens profile of positive sites at h. pylori. methodology: 109 subgingival samples collected from 17 subjects with chronic periodontitis were studied. the dna was extracted from the oral samples and analyzed for the presence of h. pylori by real-time pcr (lightcycler) using 16s rrna#120 primers which targeted the 16s rrna gene. dna from h. pylori dsm 4867 was used as a positive control. seven bacteria implicated in chronic periodontitis were selected to explore the presence of these periodontopathic species in the oral positive sites for h. pylori. results: 16 of 109 samples (14.7%) were positives of h. pylori. all the positives sites were also positives to fusobacterium nucleatum and eikenella corrodens, 62.5% to porphyromonas gingivalis, 31.25% to treponema denticola, 25% to prevotella intermedia, 12.5% to aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and 6.25% to tannerella forsythia. conclusions: h. pylori may be present in the subgingival plaque samples of patients with chronic periodontitis who are resident in a developing country. f. nucleatum and e. corrodens could coaggregate with h. pylori in the subgingival dental plaque.

TI  == detection of periodontal bacteria in atheromatous plaque by nested polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background: in recent years, increasing evidence regarding the potential association between periodontal diseases and cardiovascular diseases has been identified. the available evidence underlines the importance of detecting periodontal pathogens on atheromatous plaque as the first step in demonstrating the causal relationship between the two conditions. the main aim of this investigation is to detect periodontitis-associated bacteria from carotid artery  atheromatous plaque from patients who received an endarterectomy using strict sample procurement and laboratory procedures. methods: atheromatous plaque from endarterectomies from carotid arteries were scraped and homogenized, and bacterial dna was extracted. to obtain a representative concentration of amplicons, two amplifications of the bacterial 16s ribosomal-rna gene were carried out for each sample with universal eubacteria primers by a polymerase chain reaction (pcr). a nested pcr with specific primers for the target bacteria  was performed next. statistical tests included the chi(2) test. results: forty-two atheromatous plaque were analyzed. all of them were positive for >/=1 target bacterial species. the bacterial species most commonly found was porphyromonas gingivalis (78.57%; 33 of 42), followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) (66.67%;  28 of 42), tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (61.90%; 26 of 42),  eikenella corrodens (54.76%; 23 of 42), fusobacterium nucleatum (50.00%; 21 of 42), and campylobacter rectus (9.52%; four of 42). the simultaneous presence of various bacterial species within the same specimen was a common observation. conclusion: within the limitations of this study, the presence of dna from periodontitis-associated bacteria in carotid artery atheromatous plaque retrieved by endarterectomy is confirmed.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == clinical periodontal and microbiologic parameters in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  == background: a limited number of studies suggest a prevalence of periodontal pathogens in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra); however, results are inconsistent. the aim of this study is to investigate clinical periodontal and microbiologic parameters in patients with ra. methods: sixty-six patients with ra, aged 49.5 +/- 8.4 years, participated in the study. the periodontal classification was assessed with the periodontal screening index (psr/psi) allocated to the following parameters: 1) healthy; 2) gingivitis (psr/psi score 0 to 2, maximum one sextant score; 3) moderate periodontitis (>1 sextant psr/psi score 3, maximum one sextant score; or, 4) severe periodontitis (>1 sextant psr/psi score 4). pool samples were taken for microbiologic (polymerase chain reaction) analysis for the presence of 11 periodontal pathogens. statistical analysis was by non-parametric analysis of covariance. results: no patients were  periodontally healthy: 24 patients were classified as having gingivitis; 18 patients had moderate periodontitis; 23 patients had severe periodontitis; and one patient was toothless. for most patients, fusobacterium nucleatum (98%), eikenella corrodens (91%), and parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros; 88%) were above the detection threshold. strong periodontal pathogens were less frequently detected: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 16%); porphyromonas gingivalis (58%); and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis, 78%). statistical analysis showed no significant influence of rheumatic factor (p = 0.33) on periodontal classification and on microbiologic parameters (p >0.05). only smoking showed a significant influence (p = 0.0004) on the periodontal classification and in the case of e. corrodens (p = 0.02). conclusions: most patients with ra in this study showed moderate-to-severe periodontitis and the presence of periodontal pathogens. no association was found between rheumatic factor on periodontal classification and microbiologic parameters.

TI  == evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of dentifrices on human oral bacteria.
AB  == objective: in vitro testing of antimicrobial agents is an important tool in the testing hierarchy, and may provide interesting insights into their potential clinical efficacy. agents with demonstrable in vitro antimicrobial activity may be effective against the same microorganisms in vivo, whereas agents without demonstrable in vitro antimicrobial activity are unlikely to exhibit in vivo antimicrobial activity. in addition, these methods may also be useful in screening antimicrobial agents in product formulations because such agents with both in vitro and in vivo activity may have reduced antimicrobial effects when formulated into a dentifrice. accordingly, this study examined the in vitro and ex vivo antimicrobial activity of three commercial dentifrices: one formulated with 0.243% sodium fluoride (crest cavity protection toothpaste-regular); one with 0.454% stannous fluoride, sodium hexametaphosphate, and zinc lactate (crest  pro-health), and one with 0.3% triclosan, 2.0% pvm/ma copolymer, and 0.243% sodium fluoride (colgate total). methods: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of each dentifrice was determined for resident oral bacterial species, including bacteria that are associated with dental caries; periodontitis, and oral halitosis. evaluations were performed on individual laboratory strains, and  on oral bacteria from supragingival plaque samples obtained from 10 adults and from oral rinse samples obtained from 18 adults. results: the lowest mics against the oral strains and human samples, i.e., greatest antimicrobial activity, were seen for the triclosan/ copolymer dentifrice. there was, in general, a four-fold  difference in mics between the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice and the stannous fluoride/sodium hexametaphosphate/zinc lactate dentifrice. the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice significantly inhibited periodontal pathogens, such as aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, and fusobacterium nucleatum. in ex vivo tests measuring antimicrobial effects, the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice substantially inhibited bacterial growth after 30-, 60-, and 120-second exposures compared to the sodium fluoride or stannous fluoride/sodium hexametaphosphate/zinc lactate dentifrices. similarly, in ex vivo tests measuring antimicrobial effects on supragingival plaque biofilms, the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice substantially inhibited bacterial growth compared  to the other test dentifrices. conclusion: different in vitro and ex vivo analyses show that the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice has significant antimicrobial activity on oral bacteria, including species causing dental caries, periodontitis, and oral halitosis, and it provides superior efficacy compared to  the stannous fluoride/sodium hexametaphosphate/zinc lactate dentifrice.

TI  == killing of anaerobic pathogens by predatory bacteria.
AB  == recently, the predation of bdellovibrio bacteriovorus on a periodontal pathogen has been described. the current study explores the potential antimicrobial activity of a range of predatory bacteria against key periodontal pathogens. a number of representatives from the bdellovibrio, bacteriovorax and peredibacter lineages (called 'balos') were tested for their activity towards a group of key periodontal pathogens and an optimal multiplicity of infection was established. as the oral cavity contains a wide variety of bacteria that are not preyed upon,  it was investigated if they can have an effect on the predation efficiency of balos. it was concluded that a number of important variables involved in bacterial predation are found to be compatible with the composition of the oral microbiota. this finding makes the case for continued study of the potential for  balos to combat periodontal pathogens.

TI  == predation of oral pathogens by bdellovibrio bacteriovorus 109j.
AB  == periodontal diseases are multifactorial infections elicited by a complex of primarily gram-negative bacteria that interact with host tissues and lead to the  destruction of the periodontal structures. bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a gram-negative bacterium that preys upon other gram-negative bacteria. it was previously shown that b. bacteriovorus has an ability to attack and remove surface-attached bacteria or biofilms. in this study, we examined the host specificity of b. bacteriovorus strain 109j and its ability to prey on oral pathogens associated with periodontitis, including; aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. we further demonstrated that b. bacteriovorus 109j has an ability to remove biofilms of ei.  corrodens as well as biofilms composed of a. actinomycetemcomitans. bdellovibrio  bacteriovorus was able to remove a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilms developed on hydroxyapatite surfaces and in the presence of saliva, as well as to detach metabolically inactive biofilms. experiments aimed at enhancing the biofilm removal aptitude of b. bacteriovorus with the aid of extracellular-polymeric-substance-degrading enzymes demonstrated that proteinase-k inhibits predation. however, treating a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilms with dspb, a poly-n-acetylglucosamine (pga) -hydrolysing enzyme, increased biofilm removal. increased biofilm removal was also recorded when a. actinomycetemcomitans pga-defective mutants were used as host cells, suggesting that pga degradation could enhance the removal of a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilm by b. bacteriovorus.

TI  == identification of periodontal pathogens and severity of periodontitis in patients with and without chronic kidney disease.
AB  == objective: in this study of patients with chronic periodontitis (cp), the severity of the disease and the main periodontal pathogens identified in patients with chronic kidney disease (ckd) were compared with those detected in individuals without systemic disease. design: nineteen patients with cp without evidence of systemic disease (control group), 25 patients with cp and ckd who were in the pre-dialysis stages (pre-dialysis group), and 22 patients with cp and ckd who were on renal replacement therapy (rrt group) were examined. the severity of cp was based on the investigation of probing depth (pd) and clinical attachment level (cal). the definition and stage of ckd were based on the criteria proposed by the kidney disease outcomes quality initiative of the national kidney foundation. glomerular filtration rate (gfr) was estimated using  the equation of modification of diet in renal disease and the identification of microorganisms in subgingival plaque was performed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: candida albicans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were more common in patients who were on rrt and pre-dialysis than in control subjects. cp was more severe in patients with ckd. a strong association was observed between the frequency of c. albicans (p =  0.056), p.gingivalis (p = 0.008), t. denticola (p = 0.013) and cal, when ckd patients were compared with the control group. conclusion: cp is more severe and  is associated with increased frequency of c. albicans, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola in patients with ckd.

TI  == examination of periodontal pathogens in stenotic valve specimens and in whole blood samples in patients affected by aortic valve stenosis and chronic periodontitis.
AB  == periodontitis may be a risk factor for atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. the influence of periodontal pathogens in cardiovascular diseases needs  further investigation. therefore, the aims of this clinical study are: to test the presence of periodontal bacteria dna in aortic valves and to assess the concomitant presence of the same periodontal bacteria dna in whole blood samples  in patients affected by aortic valve stenosis and chronic periodontitis. nineteen consecutive patients (12 males and 7 females, age: 49-85 years) were enrolled in  this study after having been subjected to a complete periodontal evaluation to confirm the diagnosis of chronic periodontitis. all patients were scheduled for aortic valve replacement surgery. after clinical and microbial periodontal examination, the aortic valve tissue specimens were obtained by excision during valve replacement surgery and the patients were subjected to the whole blood sampling before the surgery. the polymerase chain reaction technology was used to detect the putative periodontal pathogens tannerella forshytia, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens and treponema  denticola. neither the 19 aortic valve specimens nor the blood samples were positive for the genoma of the selected periodontal pathogens. the selected periodontal pathogens did not colonize the aortic valve of patients affected by stenosis and bacterial genoma was not present in whole blood samples. a high blood pressure at the aortic valve may prevent the adhesion and proliferation of  bacterial colonies.

TI  == detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria in pregnant women by traditional anaerobic culture method and by a commercial molecular genetic method.
AB  == to culture facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria is a well-established method for analyzing subgingival plaque samples. micro-ident and micro-ident plus (hain  lifescience gmbh, nehren, germany) tests are two commercially available rapid pcr-based methods for the identification and quantification of putative periodontopathogen bacteria. in this study, we compared these commercial pcr-based hybridization methods with conventional anaerobic culture technique. a  total of 36 subgingival plaque samples were collected from periodontal pockets of pregnant women with chronic localized periodontitis. aliquots of these samples were evaluated with species-specific probes provided by micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests simultaneously, and from the same samples anaerobic and capnophylic bacteria were cultured on selective media. the overall agreement between both methods was excellent for eubacterium nodatum, tannerella forsythia  and porphyromonas gingivalis (97-92%), fair for capnocytophaga sp, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia (91-89%) and poor for fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra (micromonas micros), and campylobacter rectus (86-78%). discrepancies in the results may be explained by inability of culture method to distinguish between closely related taxa (e.i p. intermedia/prevotella. nigrescens), and problems of keeping periodontopathogen bacteria viable, which is required for successful detection by standard culture method. nucleic acid-based methods may replace cultivation method as frequently used methods in microbiological diagnosis of progressive periodontitis, thus micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests can be recommended where culture of periodontopathogenic bacteria is not performed in routine microbiology laboratories to analyze subgingival plaque samples.

TI  == quantification of five putative periodontal pathogens in female patients with and without chronic periodontitis by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == chronic periodontitis is a highly prevalent endogenous polymicrobial disease. to  better understand the etiology of the disease a quantitative approach is mandatory and real-time pcr is the molecular technique currently preferred to achieve this purpose. taking into account that such a kind of study is still scarce, we aimed to evaluate the association between periodontal microbiota and chronic periodontitis. a total of 60 low-income age-matched female adults, 30 with chronic periodontitis and 30 without periodontal disease, were enrolled. dna obtained from subgingival specimens was used for quantification of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia by real-time pcr.  a. actinomycetemcomitans, e. corrodens, and f. nucleatum were detected in all subjects, p. gingivalis was observed in 70.0% and 46.6% and p. intermedia in 90.0% and 80.0% of chronic periodontitis patients and periodontally healthy subjects, respectively. p. gingivalis mean count was significantly higher in patients with chronic periodontitis than in periodontally healthy individuals. accurate detection and quantification of five putative periodontal pathogens was  feasible using a simple and fast real-time pcr protocol. although p. gingivalis and p. intermedia have been found more commonly in chronic periodontitis patients, no statistical difference was observed between periodontally diseased and healthy groups. quantitative data indicated association between p. gingivalis and chronic periodontitis. however, because of its uneven distribution, it should not be solely taken as a marker of periodontal status.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of commercial dentifrices.
AB  == this investigation compared the effects of a fluoride dentifrice and toothpastes  formulated with antimicrobial ingredients (stannous fluoride and triclosan/copolymer) on oral micro-organisms, including those found in samples taken from the human oral cavity. microbiological techniques determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of each dentifrice necessary to inhibit  the growth of bacterial strains from the healthy oral cavity, as well as those found in dental caries, periodontal disease, and halitosis. ex vivo studies utilized oral rinse samples and supragingival plaque from adults to determine antimicrobial effects on the entire microbial diversity of these samples, including biofilm-derived micro-organisms. the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice demonstrated the lowest mics and significantly inhibited gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (including the periodontal pathogens aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, and fusobacterium nucleatum). in the  ex vivo tests, the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice demonstrated substantial inhibition in the oral rinse samples over each treatment period (p > 0.0005) as compared to either the fluoride or stannous fluoride dentifrices. similarly, the  triclosan/copolymer dentifrice demonstrated the highest inhibition of micro-organisms in the supragingival plaque biofilm (p < 0.0005). no significant  differences were observed between the fluoride and stannous fluoride dentifrices  (p > 0.5).

TI  == the impact of the stone age diet on gingival conditions in the absence of oral hygiene.
AB  == background: the objective of this study was to assess the oral microbiota and clinical data in subjects without access to traditional oral hygiene methods and  who ate a diet available in the stone age. methods: ten subjects living in an environment replicating the stone age for 4 weeks were enrolled in this study. bleeding on probing (bop), gingival and plaque indices, and probing depth (pd) were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. microbiologic samples were collected at the mesio-buccal subgingival aspects of all teeth and from the dorsum of the tongue and were processed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization methods. results: no subject had periodontitis. mean bop decreased from 34.8% to 12.6% (p <0.001).  mean gingival index scores changed from 0.38 to 0.43 (not statistically significant) and mean plaque scores increased from 0.68 to 1.47 (p <0.001). pd at sites of subgingival sampling decreased (mean difference: 0.2 mm; p <0.001). at week 4, the total bacterial count was higher (p <0.001) for 24 of 74 species, including bacteroides ureolyticus, eikenella corrodens, lactobacillus acidophilus, capnocytophaga ochracea, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, haemophilus influenzae, helicobacter pylori, porphyromonas endodontalis, staphylococcus aureus (two strains), streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus anginosis, and streptococcus mitis. bacterial counts from tongue samples were higher at baseline (p <0.001) for 20 species, including tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; serotype a), and streptococcus  spp. conclusions: the experimental gingivitis protocol is not applicable if the diet (e.g., stone age) does not include refined sugars. although plaque levels increased, bop and pd decreased. subgingival bacterial counts increased for several species not linked to periodontitis, whereas tongue bacterial samples decreased during the study period.

AB  == as the breadth of bacterial diversity in the oral cavity has been deciphered by molecular studies, several newly identified species/phylotypes have emerged as potential pathogens. we hypothesized that many of these species/phylotypes could  also be involved with the etiology of endodontic abscesses. abscess aspirates from 42 persons were analyzed for the presence of 81 species/phylotypes by means  of a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. associations between the most frequently detected taxa were calculated. the most prevalent taxa were fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, and porphyromonas endodontalis. other  frequently found taxa included olsenella uli, streptococci, eikenella corrodens,  some as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes (bacteroidetes clone x083 and synergistes clone ba121), and newly named species (prevotella baroniae and dialister invisus). several positive bacterial associations were disclosed. findings not only strengthen the association of many cultivable species with abscesses, but also include some newly named species and uncultivated phylotypes in the set of candidate pathogens associated with this disease.

TI  == periodontal pathogen levels in adolescents before, during, and after fixed orthodontic appliance therapy.
AB  == introduction: this purpose of this study was to document and investigate changes  in periodontal pathogen levels before, during, and after orthodontic treatment in adolescents. methods: dna gene probe analysis was used to quantify the levels of  8 periodontal pathogens before, during, and after treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances in 190 concurrently treated adolescent orthodontic patients. the 8 pathogens examined were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), tannerella forsythia (tf), eikenella corrodens (ec), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), treponema denticola (td), and campylobacter rectus (cr). chi-square tests were used to determine whether the percentages of subjects with high counts significantly changed over time. logistic regression analyses were also performed to derive the relative risk of higher counts of pathogenic bacteria with fixed appliances at the various time intervals studied. results: for 6 (pi, tf, ec, fn, td, cr) of the 8 pathogens, the percentages of subjects with high pathogen counts increased  significantly after 6 months of fixed appliance treatment, but these returned to  pretreatment levels by 12 months of orthodontic treatment. no pathogen level was  significantly higher after 12 months of orthodontic treatment, and orthodontic treatment was found to be significantly protective for half of the pathogens (ec, fn, td, cr) posttreatment. conclusions: orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances does not increase the risk of high levels of these periodontal pathogens.

TI  == factors affecting human supragingival biofilm composition. i. plaque mass.
AB  == background and objective: little is known about the factors that affect the microbial composition of supragingival biofilms. this study was designed to examine the relationship between total dna probe counts of supragingival biofilm  samples, clinical parameters and supragingival biofilm composition. material and  methods: supragingival plaque samples were taken from 187 systemically healthy adult subjects (n = 4745 samples). all samples were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the relationship between total dna probe counts and microbial composition was examined by subsetting the data into 10 groups based on 10 percentile increments  of the total dna probe counts. differences among groups in terms of species counts and proportions were sought, as well as relationships of total plaque dna  probe count and clinical parameters. results: there was a wide distribution in mean total dna probe counts among the 187 subjects. with increasing total plaque  levels there was a change in the proportions of individual species and microbial  complexes. 'small plaques' were characterized by high proportions of species in the yellow, orange, purple and 'other' complexes; plaques of moderate mass were characterized by high proportions of actinomyces and purple complex species, while 'large plaques' exhibited increased proportions of green and orange complex species. measures of gingival inflammation, pocket depth and recession were significantly positively associated with total dna probe counts. increased plaque numbers were related to increased pocket depth irrespective of presence or absence of gingival inflammation. conclusion: the proportions of individual species and microbial complexes in supragingival biofilms are influenced by the total numbers of organisms in the biofilm.

TI  == streptococcus cristatus attenuates fusobacterium nucleatum-induced interleukin-8  expression in oral epithelial cells.
AB  == background and objective: oral epithelial cells may be invaded by a polymicrobial intracellular flora, including pathogens together with commensals. various oral pathogens can induce the production of interleukin-8, a potent neutrophil chemotractant, in oral epithelial cells. evidence from the gut suggests that commensal species may modulate inflammatory responses to pathogens. the aim of this study was to examine the interleukin-8 responses of oral epithelial cells to an oral pro-inflammatory species, fusobacterium nucleatum, in combination with an oral commensal, streptococcus cristatus. material and methods: kb, tert-2, tr146  and scc15 cells were cocultured with f. nucleatum and s. cristatus, either alone  or in combination, at 37 degrees c in 5% co2 under various conditions. the mrna expression of interleukin-8 was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay. results: f. nucleatum alone evoked a potent interleukin-8 response, whereas s. cristatus alone did not induce significant interleukin-8 expression in oral epithelial cells. when present together, s. cristatus attenuated the f. nucleatum-induced interleukin-8 production in the four oral epithelial cell lines to varying degrees. the inhibitory effect of s. cristatus was independent of its  viability and its co-aggregation with f. nucleatum, was not related to soluble bacterial products and appeared to require bacterial contact with epithelial cells. similar effects were seen with several other species of oral streptococci. conclusion: our data suggest that s. cristatus may exert immunomodulatory effects on the interleukin-8 response of oral epithelial cells to f. nucleatum challenge.

TI  == comparison of culture methods and multiplex pcr for the detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria in biofilm associated with severe forms of periodontitis.
AB  == conventional culture methods and multiplex pcr, both of which we have been used for a long time in our clinical microbiology laboratory, were compared for their  ability to detect a selected panel of periodontopathic bacteria: aggregatibacter  actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia. tests were performed in a single subgingival sample taken from a periodontal diseased site with a probing depth equal to or greater than 6mm. the results were compared site-by-site, taking into account the quality and the presence or absence of pathogens. 529 samples of subgingival plaque were analysed and the prevalence of  the six species monitored varied in relation to the species itself and the method of detection. the most represented species is f. nucleatum, with a percentage of  positive variability between 44.9% pcr and 46.5% culture test. generally, the lowest prevalence was determined by culture test, with the exception of e. corrodens and f. nucleatum, which, unlike other bacteria, have been seen in higher percentages in culture with respect to pcr. for both methods, there was a  good degree of accuracy in the determination of a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, e. corrodens, and p. gingivalis. it becomes weak for f. nucleatum and p.  intermedia. both culture and pcr techniques introduced many methodological problems when applied in oral microbiology, but the ideal technique for accurate  detection of pathogens in subgingival plaque samples has yet to be developed.

TI  == granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (gcp-2/cxcl6) complements interleukin-8 in periodontal disease.
AB  == background and objective: mucosal inflammatory responses are orchestrated largely by pro-inflammatory chemokines. the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (cxcl6) is involved in neutrophil recruitment and migration. previous studies have shown that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 is up-regulated during mucosal  inflammation (e.g. in inflammatory bowel disease), similarly to the functionally  and structurally related chemokine interleukin-8. nevertheless, unlike interleukin-8, a role of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival inflammation has not been yet demonstrated. in this study we aimed to evaluate the expression of the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in clinically healthy vs. diseased gingival tissues and to explore possible correlations with clinical and microbiological markers of periodontitis. material and methods: gene expression in 184 'diseased' and 63 'healthy' gingival tissue specimens from 90 patients with periodontitis was analyzed using affymetrix u133plus2.0 arrays. the expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was further confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while the localization of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival tissues was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. plaque samples from the adjacent periodontal pockets were collected and evaluated for 11 species of periodontal bacteria using checkerboard dna-dna hybridizations. results: among all known chemokines, gcp-2 expression was the most up-regulated (3.8-fold, p < 1.1 x 10(-16)), in 'diseased' vs. 'healthy' tissue as compared to  a 2.6-fold increased expression of interleukin-8 mrna (p < 1.2 x 10(-15)). increased expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlated with higher  levels of 'red' and 'orange' complex pathogens and with increased probing depth,  but not with attachment loss. immunohistochemistry showed that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was expressed in gingival vascular endothelium. conclusion: the level of expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlates with the  severity of periodontitis and appears to act as a hitherto unrecognized functional adjunct to interleukin-8 in diseased gingival tissues.

TI  == photodynamic therapy as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
AB  == background: recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested a potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (pdt) in the treatment of periodontitis. however, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of pdt in the treatment of periodontitis. the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiologic effects of the adjunctive use of pdt to non-surgical periodontal treatment. methods: twenty-four subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomly treated with scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of pdt (test) or scaling and root planing alone (control). full-mouth plaque score (fmps), full-mouth bleeding score (fmbs), probing depth (pd), gingival recession, and clinical attachment level (cal) were measured at baseline and 3 and 6 months after therapy. primary outcome variables were changes in pd and cal. microbiologic evaluation of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), treponema denticola, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium nodatum, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga spp. was performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months following therapy by using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. results: at 3 and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups with regard to cal, pd,  fmps, or microbiologic changes. at 3 and 6 months, a statistically significantly  greater improvement in fmbs was found in the test group. conclusion: the additional application of a single episode of pdt to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of pd reduction and cal gain, but it resulted in a significantly higher reduction in bleeding scores compared to scaling and root planing alone.

TI  == rapid and simple detection of eight major periodontal pathogens by the loop-mediated isothermal amplification method.
AB  == loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) was applied to develop a rapid and  simple detection system for eight periodontal pathogens: aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia. primers were designed from the 16s ribosomal rna gene for each pathogen, and the lamp amplified the targets specifically and efficiently under isothermal condition at 64 degrees c.  to simplify the manipulation of lamp examination, boiled cells and intact cells suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) were tested as templates besides extracted dna template. the detection limits were 1-10 cells per tube using extracted dna template. however, lamp methods using boiled cells and intact cells required 10-100 and 100-1000 cells per tube, respectively. lamps for a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and p. intermedia were then applied to clinical plaque samples, and the method demonstrated equal or higher sensitivity  compared with the conventional real-time pcr method. these findings suggest the usefulness of the lamp method for the rapid and simple microbiological diagnosis  of periodontitis, and the possibility of lamp examination without the dna extraction step.

TI  == photodynamic therapy as adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment in patients on periodontal maintenance: a randomized controlled clinical trial.
AB  == recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested the potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (pdt) in the treatment of periodontitis. however, currently, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of pdt in the treatment of periodontitis. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of the adjunctive use of pdt in non-surgical periodontal treatment in patients receiving supportive periodontal therapy. twenty-four patients receiving regularly supportive periodontal therapy  were randomly treated with either subgingival scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of pdt (test) or subgingival scaling and root planing alone (control). the following parameters were evaluated at baseline and at 3 months and 6 months after therapy: full mouth plaque score (fmps), full mouth bleeding score (fmbs), bleeding on probing (bop) at experimental sites, probing pocket depth (ppd), gingival recession (rec), and clinical attachment level (cal). primary outcome variables were changes in ppd and cal. microbiological evaluation of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.), prevotella intermedia (p.i.), tannerella forsythensis (t.f.), treponema denticola (t.d.), peptostreptococcus micros (p.m.), fusobacterium nucleatum (f.n.), campylobacter rectus (c.r.), eubacterium nodatum (e.n.), eikenella corrodens (e.c.), and capnocytophaga species (c.s.) was also performed at baseline and at 3 months and 6 months after therapy, using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. no differences in any of the investigated parameters were observed at baseline between the two groups. at 3 months and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of ppd, cal and fmps. at 3 months and 6 months, a statistically significantly higher improvement of bop was found in the test group. at 3 months  after therapy, the microbiological analysis showed a statistically significant reduction of f.n. and e.n. in the test group. at 6 months, statistically significantly higher numbers of e.c. and c.s. were detected in the test group. the additional application of a single episode of pdt to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of ppd reduction and cal gain, but it resulted in significantly higher reduction of bleeding scores than following scaling and root planing alone.

AB  == objective: to investigate bacterial populations in subgingival and supragingival  plaque samples of patients with inflammatory periodontal diseases and activities  of the lysosomal enzymes--lysozyme, alkaline phosphatase, and beta-glucuronidase--in peripheral venous blood, in gingival crevicular fluid, and mixed nonstimulated saliva. methods and materials: the study included 60 patients with inflammatory periodontal diseases without any internal pathology and 24 periodontally healthy subjects. molecular genetic assay (micro-ident plus, germany) for complex identification of additional six periodontopathic bacteria was applied. the activity of lysozyme was determined turbidimetrically, the activity of alkaline phosphatase--spectrophotometrically with a "monarch" biochemical analyzer, the activity beta-glucuronidase--according to the method described by mead et al. and modified by strachunskii. results: a statistically significant association between clinical and bacteriological data was found in the following cases: gingival bleeding in the presence of eubacterium nodatum, eikenella corrodens, capnocytophaga spp. (p<0.01); pathological periodontal pockets in the presence of peptostreptococcus micros (alpha< or =0.05 and beta< or =0.2), fusobacterium nucleatum (alpha< or =0.05 and beta< or =0.2), campylobacter rectus (alpha< or =0.05 and beta< or =0.2), and capnocytophaga spp. (p<0.05); and satisfactory oral hygiene in the presence of all microorganisms investigated (p<0.05). the activity of lysozyme in gingival crevicular fluid and  mixed nonstimulated saliva indicates the severity of periodontal inflammation. based on clinical data, in assessing the amount of lysozyme in mixed nonstimulated saliva, sensitivity and specificity of 100% was found. increased activities of lysozyme, alkaline phosphatase, and beta-glucuronidase were found in peripheral venous blood of patients with inflammatory periodontal disease as compared to control group. conclusions: the main principles of the treatment of periodontal inflammatory diseases should be based on microorganism elimination, creation of individual treatment means affecting microflora in the mouth and immune system of macroorganisms.

TI  == bleeding on probing differentially relates to bacterial profiles: the oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study.
AB  == aim: various bacterial species are differentially prevalent in periodontal health, gingivitis or periodontitis. we tested the independent associations between three bacterial groupings and gingival inflammation in an epidemiological study. material and methods: in 706 oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study (invest) participants > or =55 years, bleeding on probing (bop), pocket depth (pd) and subgingival plaque samples (n=4866) were assessed in eight sites per mouth. eleven bacterial species were quantitatively assayed and grouped as follows: (i) aetiologic burden (eb, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella  forsythia); (ii) putative burden (pb, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens,  fusobacterium nucleatum, micromonas micros, prevotella intermedia); (iii) health-associated burden (hab, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula). results: after mutual adjustment for eb, pb and hab, the bop prevalence increased by 45% ( p<0.0001) across increasing quartiles of eb while bop decreased by 13% ( p<0.0001) across increasing quartiles of hab. mean pd increased 0.8 mm and decreased 0.3 mm from the first to fourth quartiles of eb (p<0.0001) and hab ( p<0.0001), respectively. among 1214 plaque samples with fourth quartile eb, 60% were collected from sites with pd < or =3 mm. conclusion: bacterial species believed to be aetiologically related to periodontitis were associated with bop in sites with minimal pd and/or attachment level (al). species presumed to be associated with periodontal health demonstrated inverse associations with bop.

TI  == prevalence of periodontal pathogens in subgingival lesions, atherosclerotic plaques and healthy blood vessels: a preliminary study.
AB  == background and objective: previous studies have reported different periodontal bacteria in atherosclerotic lesions, but their involvement in plaque formation remains unclear. the aim of the present study was to investigate the presence of  20 periodontal bacteria in atherosclerotic samples and healthy blood vessels (used as controls) and to clarify their relationship in regard to clinical and bacteriological periodontal status. material and methods: the day before vascular surgery the patients had a thorough periodontal examination and bacteriological samples were taken from periodontally diseased sites. atheromatous plaques, internal mammary arteries and saphenous veins were harvested during surgery. a dna-dna hybridization procedure was used to screen periodontal and vascular samples for the 20 selected bacterial species. results: periodontal samples from  the severe periodontitis group were found to have a higher prevalence and biomass of bacterial species than the moderate periodontitis group. in vessel samples, the prevalence of the same 20 bacterial species analyzed together was similar in  the two groups, except for saphenous veins. conclusion: the presence of periodontal pathogens in atherosclerotic plaques and in apparently healthy vessels appeared to reflect a higher level of bacteremia rather than infection of endothelial cells.

TI  == the impact of a low-frequency chlorhexidine rinsing schedule on the subgingival microbiota (the teeth clinical trial).
AB  == background: information on the efficacy of chlorhexidine (chx) rinsing on the subgingival microbiota is limited. this study tested if intermittent chx rinsing  over 5 years had an impact on the subgingival microbiota. methods: subgingival plaque samples were analyzed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method in  a double-blind randomized chx rinse study. results: a total of 210 subjects were  included. the mean age of the subjects was 71.7 (+/- 4.1) years, and 56.2% were women. evidence of alveolar bone loss was found in 39% of subjects. bacterial loads were not correlated significantly with probing depth. at year 5, subjects in the chx rinse group with no evidence of bone loss presented with lower total bacterial counts than control subjects with no bone loss. the levels of the following bacteria were significantly lower in the chx group: lactobacillus acidophilus (p <0.05), eikenella corrodens (p <0.05), fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum (p <0.01), treponema denticola (p <0.05), leptotrichia buccalis (p <0.05), and eubacterium saburreum (p <0.05). no differences in bacterial loads were found between chx and control rinse subjects with alveolar bone loss. conclusions: older subjects with or without periodontitis carry a large variety of bacteria associated with periodontitis. intermittent rinsing with chx may provide a preventive benefit in reducing levels of bacteria but only in subjects  without alveolar bone loss.

TI  == targeted profiling of oral bacteria in human saliva and in vitro biofilms with quantitative real-time pcr.
AB  == an in vitro plaque model based on the use of human salivary bacteria and tooth-like surfaces was previously developed for studying the formation of oral biofilm and its use for pre-clinical testing of candidate antimicrobial or antiplaque agents. in this study, a quantitative taqman pcr assay (qpcr) was developed to compare the bacterial compositions of in vitro biofilms to parent saliva samples, and to determine the relative contributions of different species  in the formation of the oral biofilm. in addition, the growth inhibition of saliva-derived plaque was evaluated by chlorhexidine. with this assay, which consisted of primer/probe sets targeting either 16s rdna sequences present in public databases or cloned ribosomal intergenic spacer region (isr) sequences, 15 oral bacteria derived from saliva as well as those that were responsible for biofilm formation in an in vitro plaque model were rapidly identified and quantified. among the target organisms were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, micromonas micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, tannerella forsythensis, and veillonella parvula. primer and probe sets developed were both sensitive and specific. the relative profiles of a number of bacteria in 45-h-old biofilms were determined and, when compared to saliva samples, it was found that most of the bacteria identified in  saliva also populated the in vitro plaque, including some anaerobes. brief exposure of biofilms to chlorhexidine resulted in significant losses in viability. this new broad spectrum qpcr assay in combination with the in vitro plaque model will be of significant value in the quantitative study of the microbial composition of human saliva, saliva-derived plaque, and pre-clinical evaluation of potential antimicrobial and antiplaque molecules.

AB  == aims: antagonistic abilities may confer ecological advantages for micro-organisms in competitive ecosystems. however, reports regarding this phenomenon in eikenella corrodens are not available. methods and results: nineteen e. corrodens strains, isolated from the oral cavity of human beings without periodontal disease (n = 5) and with aggressive (n = 9) and chronic (n = 5) periodontitis, as well as a reference strain (e. corrodens atcc23834), were evaluated for antagonistic activity. the following indicators were used: porphyromonas gingivalis fdc381, prevotella intermedia atcc25611, actinomyces israelii atcc12102, eubacterium lentum atcc25559, peptostreptococcus anaerobius atcc27337, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans fdcy4, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc10953, streptococcus sanguinis atcc10557, streptococcus uberis atcc9927, streptococcus mutans im/ufrj, staphylococcus aureus atcc33591 and candida albicans atcc18804. all the strains showed antagonism against at least one of the indicator strains.  this phenomenon was more frequently observed for strains isolated from patients with chronic periodontitis (36.4%), than those from healthy subjects (20.6%) and  those with aggressive periodontitis (10.8%). conclusions: the heterogeneous antagonistic spectrum exhibited by e. corrodens isolates suggests their ability to produce more than one antagonistic substance, whose ecological relevance is yet to be demonstrated. significance and impact of the study: this is the first description of antagonistic compound production by e. corrodens and its relationships with the clinical status of the patients.

TI  == infection at titanium implants with or without a clinical diagnosis of inflammation.
AB  == objectives: to assess the microbiota at implants diagnosed with peri-implantitis, implant mucositis, or being clinically healthy. material and methods: clinical and microbiological data were collected from 213 subjects (mean age: 65.7+/-14) with 976 implants in function (mean: 10.8 years, sd+/-1.5). forty species were identified by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: implant mean % plaque score was 41.8+/-32.4%. periodontitis defined by bone loss was found in 44.9% of subjects. implant mucositis was diagnosed in 59% and peri-implantitis in 14.9% of all cases. neisseria mucosa, fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum, f. nucleatum sp. polymorphum, and capnocytophaga sputigena dominated the implant sub-mucosal microbiota and the sub-gingival microbiota at tooth sites. implant probing pocket depth at the implant site with the deepest probing depth was correlated with levels of eikenella corrodens (r=0.16, p<0.05), the levels of f. nucleatum sp. vincentii (r=0.15, p<0.05), porphyromonas gingivalis (r=0.14, p<0.05), and micromonas micros (r=0.17, p=0.01). e. corrodens was found in higher levels at implants with mucositis compared with implant health (p<0.05). subjects who lost teeth due to periodontitis had higher yields of f. nucleatum sp. vincentii (p<0.02) and n. mucosa (p<0.05). independent of implant status subjects with teeth had higher levels of p. gingivalis (p<0.05), and leptotrichia buccalis (p<0.05). conclusions: at implant sites studied, few bacteria differed by whether subjects were dentate or not or by implant status.

AB  == background: the purpose of the present investigation was to compare the levels, proportions and percentage of sites colonized by 40 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontally healthy subjects and patients with  chronic periodontitis to seek possible pathogens other than the consensus pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. method: subgingival  plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 635 subjects with chronic periodontitis and 189 periodontally healthy subjects. the samples were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (total samples = 21,832). mean counts, % dna probe counts and percentage of sites colonized at >10(5) were determined for each species in each subject and then averaged in each clinical group. significance of difference between groups was determined using the mann-whitney test. association between combinations of species and periodontal status was examined by stepwise logistic regression analysis. analyses were repeated using a subset of subjects from both clinical groups who had proportions of p. gingivalis plus t. forsythia  less than the median (4.42%) found in periodontally healthy subjects. all analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: for the 824 subjects the consensus pathogens p. gingivalis and t. forsythia as well as eubacterium nodatum and treponema denticola had significantly higher mean counts, proportions and percentage of sites colonized in samples from subjects with periodontitis than from periodontally healthy subjects. there were significantly more capnocytophaga gingivalis, streptococcus gordonii and veillonella parvula in periodontally healthy subjects. e. nodatum, t. denticola, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii all had higher  counts and proportions in diseased than healthy subjects who had low proportions  of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia. logistic regression analysis indicated that the same species groups were associated with disease status after adjusting for the proportions of the other species. conclusions: this investigation confirmed the strong association of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia with chronic periodontitis and emphasized a strong association of e. nodatum and t. denticola  with periodontitis whether in the presence or absence of high levels of the consensus pathogens. other species, including s. oralis, eikenella corrodens, s.  intermedius and f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, were associated with disease when p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were present in low proportions.

AB  == the bacteria on the dorsum of the tongue are the most frequent cause of oral malodor; however, the bacterial flora of the tongue has not been well defined. although recent studies have used dna probes to detect the presence of certain periodontal pathogens, cultural studies have been limited because of the complexity of the flora of the tongue dorsum. the purpose of this study was to grow and to identify maximum numbers of capnophylic gram-negative bacilli and anaerobic micro-organisms by culturing tongue samples on to several selective and non-selective media. the most frequently isolated species included peptostreptococcus anaerobius, collinsella aerofaciens, eubacterium group, actinomyces spp., eikenella corrodens, veillonella spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, pigmented prevotella spp. and selenomonas spp. reported for the first time are actinomyces turicensis, collinsella aerofaciens, eubacterium saburreum, e. timidum, prevotella tannerae, campylobacter concisus, campylobacter mucosalis, leptotrichia buccalis, selenomonas flueggei, and centipeda periodontii. species not previously reported in studies that used only molecular techniques were identified in the present study.

TI  == effectiveness of ultrasonic instruments in the therapy of severe periodontitis: a comparative clinical-microbiological assessment with curettes.
AB  == patients with deep periodontal pockets were treated with either vector system (tg) or manual instruments (cg). clinical assessments by supragingival plaque (pl+), gingival index (gi), bleeding on probing (bop), probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal) and subgingival plaque collection for microbiological analysis were made prior to and after treatment. multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis and treponema denticola. gi, pd, cal and the number of bop+ sites underwent a significant reduction over time in both groups. when compared to baseline, the pair-wise analyses showed significantly lower pd and cal at 6 months in the cg and significant reductions in the gi, pd, cal and a number of bop+ sites at 3 and 6 months in the tg. for microbiological results, significant  reductions were seen for c. rectus and r. gingivalis in the cg and for t. forsythensis, e. corrodens and t. denticola in the tg. the total bacterial count  underwent a reduction in both groups. both ultrasonic and manual debridement are  equally effective in non-surgical periodontal therapy of severe periodontitis in  terms of clinical and microbiological effects.

TI  == streptococci dominate the diverse flora within buccal cells.
AB  == previously, we reported that intracellular actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythensis were present within buccal  epithelial cells from human subjects, as lesser components of a polymicrobial flora. in this study, we further characterized that intracellular flora by using  the same double-labeling techniques to identify fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, oral campylobacter species, eikenella corrodens, treponema denticola, gemella haemolysans, granulicatella adiacens, and total streptococci within buccal epithelial cells. all those species were found within buccal cells. in every case, species recognized by green-labeled species-specific probes were accompanied by other bacteria recognized only by a red-labeled universal probe. streptococci appeared to be a major component of the polymicrobial intracellular  flora, being present at a level from one to two logs greater than the next most common species (g. adiacens). this is similar to what is observed in oral biofilms, where diverse species interact in complex communities that often are dominated by streptococci.

TI  == prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in aggressive periodontitis patients in a chilean population.
AB  == background: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is considered a major etiologic  agent of aggressive periodontitis (agp). other periodontopathic bacteria such as  porphyromonas gingivalis are also suspected of participating in aggressive periodontitis although the evidence to support this is controversial. the aim of  the present study was to determine the prevalence of eight periodontopathic bacteria in chilean patients with agp. methods: subgingival plaque samples were collected from 36 aggressive, 30 localized, and six generalized periodontitis patients. samples from 17 advanced chronic periodontitis (cp) patients were taken as controls. samples collected from the four deepest periodontal pockets in each  patient were pooled in prereduced transport fluid (rtf) and cultured. periodontal bacteria were primarily identified by colony morphology under stereoscopic microscope and rapid biochemical tests. the identity of some bacterial isolates was confirmed by colony polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: agp showed a significatively higher prevalence of c. rectus than cp (p = 0.036). the only statistical difference found was for c. rectus. patients with agp showed a higher, but not statistically significant, prevalence of p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, p. micros, and capnocytophaga sp. a similar prevalence in both groups  of patients was observed for f. nucleatum and p. intermedia/nigrescens, and a. actinomycetemcomitans was less prevalent in agp than cp patients. in localized agp, p. intermedia/nigrescens, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, and p. micros were the more prevalent pathogens in contrast to generalized agp patients who harbored a.  actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and capnocytophaga sp. as the most prevalent bacteria. conclusions: c. rectus, p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, p. micros, and capnocytophaga sp. were the most predominant periodontopathic bacteria of agp in this chilean population, but the only statistical difference found here between agp and cp was for c. rectus, suggesting that the differences  in clinical appearance may be caused by factors other than the microbiological composition of the subgingival plaque of these patients. in this study, the prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans was much lower than that of p. gingivalis.

TI  == tobacco smoking and periodontal microflora in a saudi arabian population.
AB  == objectives: to explore the subgingival periodontal microflora in a saudi arabian  population with a special focus on its relationship with various smoking habits.  material and methods: a total of 198 individuals in the age range 17-60 years were included in the study. 29% were water-pipe smokers, 18% cigarette smokers, 13% smokers of both water pipe and cigarettes (mixed smokers) and 40% non-smokers. for each individual, a subgingival plaque sample from the deepest site in each quadrant was obtained. the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technology was used to determine the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, tannerella forsythensis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponoma denticola, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens,  selenomonas noxia and streptococcus intermedius. two cut-off levels for detection were used, score 1(10(5) bacteria) and score 3 (10(6) bacteria). results: the prevalence of individuals positive for the different microorganisms at score 1 cut-off varied from 7% to 95%. at score 3 cut-off the prevalence varied from 0% to 30%. the depth of sample site was a key factor for detection. when the depth of sample site was taken into account, no statistically significant differences were observed between cigarette smokers, water-pipe smokers, and non-smokers with regard to occurrence of the microorganisms studied. conclusions: no major differences were observed between cigarette smokers, water-pipe smokers, and non-smokers regarding the occurrence of the periodontal microorganisms studied suggesting that this portion of the subgingival periodontal microflora is independent of tobacco smoking.

TI  == effect of khat chewing on 14 selected periodontal bacteria in sub- and supragingival plaque of a young male population.
AB  == background/aims: the habit of chewing khat (catha edulis) for its amphetamine-like effects is highly prevalent in yemen and east africa, and has expanded to western countries. the purpose of this study was to estimate and compare the prevalence and levels of 14 periodontal bacteria in gingival plaque of khat chewers and khat nonchewers, as well as of khat chewing sides and khat nonchewing sides. methods: a total of 408 sub- and supragingival plaque samples were collected from 51 young males (29 khat chewers and 22 khat nonchewers; age range 19-28 years) and analyzed using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical parameters were recorded for all teeth at six sites per tooth. results: streptococcus intermedius and veillonella parvula were  significantly more prevalent in the subgingival plaque of chewers, which also showed significantly higher levels of v. parvula and eikenella corrodens. similar results were found for the subgingival plaque of the chewing sides compared to the nonchewing sides. however, there was a significantly higher prevalence and higher levels of tannerella forsythia in the subgingival plaque of the nonchewing sides. no significant differences were observed for the supragingival plaque between the two study groups. there was a significantly lower prevalence of capnocytophaga gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum in the khat chewing sides,  and higher levels of v. parvula and actinomyces israelii. conclusion: the data suggest that khat chewing induces a microbial profile that is not incompatible with gingival health.

TI  == dna probe identification of bacteria colonizing internal surfaces of the implant-abutment interface: a preliminary study.
AB  == background: currently, there is limited knowledge concerning the specific genus and species of bacteria that may colonize internal surfaces of the implant-abutment interface (iai) of two-stage dental implants. the purpose of this study was to use dna probe analysis to identify those periodontopathic bacteria that may inhabit the internal surfaces and healing abutment screw-threads of the iai of dental implants in situ. methods: following osseointegration, bacterial samples for dna probe analysis were obtained from 54  two-stage hydroxyapatite plasma spray-coated implants in 32 patients. using sterile paper points, samples were obtained from the iai of 43 implants and the screw-threads of healing abutments in the other 11 implants. dna probes were available to detect the following microbes: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola. results: all samples taken from healing abutment screw-threads were negative for all target microbes. the aggregate percentage of positive results for each target microbe for samples from internal surfaces of the iai were: 41.9%, a. actinomycetemcomitans, 60.5%, t. forsythensis; 44.2%, c rectus; 60.5%,  e. corrodens; 48.8%, f. nucleatum; 46.5%, p. gingivalis; 55.8%, p. intermedia; and 51.2%, t. denticola. in addition, no significant differences were noted between colonization of individual microbial species when comparing anterior to posterior and maxillary to mandibular implant sites. conclusions: moderate to high levels of eight different periodontopathic microbes inhabiting the internal  surfaces of the iai of 43 two-stage implants in partially edentulous patients were identified by dna probe analysis. the microbes colonized these surfaces within 25 days following the second stage surgery and placement of the healing abutment. in contrast, all samples obtained from screw-threads of 11 healing abutments were dna probe negative. these findings appear to support those of other investigations demonstrating the translocation of bacteria from residual dentition to implants.

TI  == dna-dna hybridization demonstrates multiple bacteria in osteoradionecrosis.
AB  == bone necrosis secondary to radiation was previously attributed to trauma of devitalized bone and microbiological sepsis. however, conventional microbiological technique has failed to demonstrate microorganisms throughout osteoradionecrotic bone, claimed to be hypoxic, hypovascular and hypocellular. the aim of the present study was to examine such bone for bacteria using dna-dna  hybridization. compared to standard culture methods this technique enables the investigation of a vast number of bacteria in a fairly short time. twelve deep medullary specimens from resected radionecrotic mandibles were studied. a multitude of bacterial species were detected, most of them anaerobic. porphyromonas gingivalis was the most predominant organism, followed by fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies polymorphum. all samples contained actinomyces, prevotella and f. nucleatum. the results of this study indicate that bacteria, particularly anaerobes, may play a more fundamental role in the pathophysiology of osteoradionecrosis than being merely surface contaminants.

TI  == periodontal infections and pre-term low birth weight: a case-control study.
AB  == objective: pre-term delivery of low-birth-weight infants [pre-term low birth weight (plbw)] remains a significant public health issue and a major cause of neonatal death and long-term health problems. there is a growing consensus that infections remote from fetal-placental unit may influence plbw infants. recent studies have suggested that maternal periodontal disease may be an independent risk factor for plbw. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the possible link between periodontal infections and plbw by means of clinical and microbiological data in post-partum women with low socioeconomic level. methods:  clinical periodontal recordings comprising dental plaque, bleeding on probing, probing pocket depth and gingival recession were performed (six sites/tooth) in a total number of 181 women (53 cases and 128 controls) within 3 days post-partum.  subgingival plaque samples from mesio-or disto-buccal aspect of randomly selected one first molar and one incisor tooth have been obtained by paperpoints and were  analysed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization with respect to 12 bacterial species. in all analyses, the individual subject was the computational unit. thus, mean values for all clinical parameters were calculated and bacterial scores from each individual sample were averaged. statistical methods included student's t-test, fisher's exact test/chi(2) test, and multiple logistic regression analysis. results: the cases have gained significantly less weight during the pregnancy than did the controls (p<0.05). there were no statistically  significant differences between the cases and controls with regard to the dental  and periodontal parameters and the values of clinical periodontal recordings were found to be very similar (p>0.05). mean and median scores (bacterial loads) of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and streptococcus intermedius in the subgingival plaque sampling sites were significantly higher in the controls than  in the cases (p<0.05). the occurrence rates of p. intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens,  selenomonas noxia and s. intermedius were higher in the cases compared with the controls, but the differences were not statistically significant (p>0.05). according to the model created by the multiple logistic regression analysis, p. micros and c. rectus were found to significantly increase the risk of plbw (p<0.01 and p<0.05 respectively), while p. nigrescens and a. actinomycetemcomitans decreased this risk (p<0.01). conclusion: the present findings indicated that when subgingival bacteria were evaluated together, p. micros and c. rectus may have a role in increasing the risk for plbw, although no single bacteria exhibited any relation with the risk of plbw. further studies are required to better clarify the possible relationship between periodontal diseases and plbw.

TI  == killing of periodontopathogenic bacteria by photodynamic therapy.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to evaluate a new approach for killing periodontopathogenic bacteria using photodynamic therapy (pdt). methods: in this  study, we investigated the photosensitizers chlorin e6, blc 1010, and blc 1014 by three different methods for their effect in pdt on the viability of periodontopathogenic bacterial species. the methods included examination of inhibition zones on agar plates, determination of colony-forming units (cfu), and the use of a bacterial viability kit. results: using the cfu method, we were able to demonstrate that the anaerobic bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and capnocytophaga gingivalis can be photoinactivated completely by illumination with an intensity of 5.3 j/cm2 in the presence of 10 microm chlorin e6 and 10 microm blc 1010. with the photosensitizers chlorin e6 and blc 1010, we were able to induce zones of inhibition on agar plates. blc 1014 failed to produce a zone of inhibition. the results of the bacterial viability test also showed that the photosensitizer blc 1014 provides the lowest photodynamic effect in comparison to the others. conclusion: the data collected to date suggest that photodynamic therapy with chlorin e6 and blc 1010 is advantageous for suppressing periodontopathogenic bacteria.

TI  == rate of cultivable subgingival periodontopathogenic bacteria in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == although microbiological studies have identified more than 400 bacterial species  in periodontal pockets, only a limited number have been implicated as periodontal pathogens. the purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of cultivable subgingival periodontopathogenic bacteria in chronic periodontitis. bacterial samples were collected with sterile paper points from the deepest periodontal pockets ((5 mm) of 203 patients: 92 males and 111 females, aged 35-55 years. the samples were cultured under anaerobic and capnophilic conditions using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and a commercial rapid test system. the isolates were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (26.8%), porphyromonas gingivalis (21.9%), capnocytophaga sputigena (16.7%), eikenella corrodens (13.2%), prevotella intermedia (10.5 %), prevotella disiens (3.1%), peptostreptococcus micros (2.9%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (2.2%), prevotella corporis (1.8%), peptostreptococcus magnus (1.3%) and fusobacterium nucleatum (0.4%). no periodontopathogenic bacterial growth was observed in 14 of the samples (6.2%). the number of samples associated with monobacterial growth and polybacterial growth were 74.9% and 18.2% respectively. it is concluded that the  bacterial composition associated with a number of patients' samples is quite complex, and that some of cultivable anaerobic and capnophilic bacteria act as periodontal pathogens in chronic periodontitis.

TI  == microbiologic diagnostics at titanium implants.
AB  == background: the microbiota found at periimplant lesions have been shown to contain putative periodontal pathogens as well as opportunistic species such as staphylococcus spp, enterics, and candida spp. therefore, a microbiologic diagnosis may be of value as guidance before treatment of such lesions. purpose:  the aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of some putative pathogens associated with long-term followed-up cases using two different microbiologic procedures. materials and methods: fifteen subjects contributed with plaque samples from teeth and implants; these were analyzed with respect to 18 putative  periimplant pathogens using cultural methods and a deoxyribonucleic acid dna-dna  hybridization technique. results: the number of individuals positive for the analyzed pathogens was similar in samples taken from teeth and implants when analyzed with the dna-dna hybridization technique. when comparing detection frequency by culture procedure and by "checkerboard" technique at implants, the number of individuals positive for these species was lower with the traditional culture technique than with the checkerboard analyses. using a higher cutoff point (> or = 4) with the checkerboard technique, the number of positive individuals was generally lower than that found with the culture technique. when  comparing the techniques on an implant site level, the prevalence obtained by culture was lower for all analyzed species. if the specific species were present  in the samples analyzed by the checkerboard technique, they were present only in  every second sample analyzed with the culture technique. the high specificity values showed that if the checkerboard technique did not detect any porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, or fusobacterium nucleatum, the bacteria were also undetectable by the culture technique. the two methods therefore did not overlap but did supplement each other. conclusions: based on the current results it is recommended that the technique used when analyzing microbiota around titanium implants should be a combination of the two protocols mentioned as they seem to give the most comprehensive outcome when used together.

TI  == antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacteria from odontogenic infections in taiwan.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility of facultative and anaerobic odontogenic infectious flora to various antibiotics. we assessed 178 bacterial strains isolated from 74 patients with odontogenic infections. the e-test was used to determine susceptibility. the microbial flora was predominantly facultative gram-positive organisms and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. the results of antimicrobial susceptibility test showed that ampicillin  resistance was found with a very high level of minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) in approximately one third of fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, and eikenella corrodens isolates (mic > or = 8 microg/ml). greater activity was generally noted with amoxicillin than with ampicillin, but even beta-lactamase inhibitor incorporated amoxicillin showed resistance in more than 10% of all groups except viridans group streptococci and  porphyromonas gingivalis. tetracycline and erythromycin were considerably less active against the majority of the tested bacterial strains, while minocycline and doxycycline exerted strong antimicrobial activity and could inhibit strains grown at a very low concentration. among all the tested antibiotics, travofloxacin appears to be a promising drug expressing the highest activities (mic90 < or = 1 microg/ml), and was regarded as a potent bactericidal drug in odontogenic infections.

AB  == background/aim: to examine the proportions of 40 bacterial species in samples from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces and saliva in systemically healthy adult subjects and to compare these microbiotas with those of supra- and subgingival plaque. methods: microbial samples were taken from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces of 225 systemically healthy subjects using a "buccal brush". saliva was taken by expectoration. forty-four of these subjects provided additional supra- and subgingival plaque samples. samples were individually evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage  of total dna probe count was determined for each species, at each sample location and averaged across subjects. the significance of differences among the proportions of the 40 test species at different sample locations was sought in the 225 and 44 subjects separately using the quade test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. cluster analysis was performed using the proportions of the 40 species at the different sample locations using the minimum similarity coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. the proportions of each species were averaged across subjects in the resulting cluster groups and the significance of differences was tested using the t-test and anova. results: microbial profiles differed markedly among sample locations in the 225 subjects,  with 34 of 40 species differing significantly. proportions of veillonella parvula and prevotella melaninogenica were higher in saliva and on the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the tongue, while streptococcus mitis and s. oralis were in significantly lower proportions in saliva and on the tongue dorsum. cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 2 clusters with >85% similarity. cluster 1  comprised saliva, lateral and dorsal tongue surfaces, while cluster 2 comprised the remaining soft tissue locations. v. parvula, p. melaninogenica, eikenella corrodens, neisseria mucosa, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium periodonticum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii and porphyromonas gingivalis were in significantly higher proportions in cluster 1 and s. mitis, s. oralis and s. noxia were significantly higher in cluster 2. these findings were confirmed using data from the 44 subjects providing plaque samples. the microbial profiles of supra- and subgingival plaque differed from the other sample locations, particularly in the increased proportions of the actinomyces species. species of  different genera exhibited different proportions on the various intraoral surfaces, but even within the genus streptococcus, there were differences in colonization patterns. s. oralis, s. mitis and s. constellatus colonized the soft tissues and saliva in higher proportions than the samples from the teeth, while the other 4 streptococcal species examined colonized the dental surfaces in proportions comparable to the soft tissue locations and saliva. conclusions: proportions of bacterial species differed markedly on different intraoral surfaces. the microbiota of saliva was most similar to that of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue. the microbiotas of the soft tissues resembled each other more than the microbiotas that colonized the teeth both above and below the gingival margin.

AB  == epileptic patients taking phenytoin with gingival-overgrowth and those without gingival-overgrowth were compared for daily drug dose, plasma total phenytoin concentration, plasma free-phenytoin concentration and serum igg antibody titre against 13 periodontal bacteria. significantly higher daily drug dose was noted in patients with gingival overgrowth (p < 0.05) when compared with those without  overgrowth. in addition, both total and free forms of plasma phenytoin concentration were significantly higher in sera of patients with gingival growth  than of those without overgrowth (p < 0.01). strong positive correlation was found between daily drug dose and serum phenytoin concentration in patients with  gingival overgrowth, while weak correlation was found in patients without gingival overgrowth, suggesting a difference in drug metabolism in these two groups. however, no differences were found in serum igg antibody titres to 13 periodontal bacteria examined between two groups. these results suggest that metabolic ability of phenytoin is one of the factors for developing gingival overgrowth, and that periodontal infection may not be a primary causative factor  for gingival overgrowth but act as an additive factor which increase tissue mass  for this unwanted side effect.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of magainin analogues against anaerobic oral pathogens.
AB  == magainins are a family of potent antimicrobial cationic peptides that possess antimicrobial activity against a wide range of target organisms. in this study, the antimicrobial activity of synthetic magainin-mimetic compounds msi-751 and msi-774 was investigated against the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, prevotella loescheii and prevotella intermedia. p. gingivalis was more susceptible to msi-751 than to msi-774, whereas the other oral pathogens showed little difference in susceptibility to the two compounds. msi-751 exhibited a rapid, dose-dependent bactericidal effect on p. gingivalis. electron microscopy of msi-751-treated p. gingivalis revealed intact cell wall vesicles devoid of cell contents, suggesting perturbation of the cytoplasmic membrane by this compound, perhaps equivalent to formation of membrane-disruptive ion channels by magainin peptides. these studies demonstrate that synthetic magainin derivatives exhibit antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens by disruption of cell membrane integrity.

TI  == microbial profile on metallic and ceramic bracket materials.
AB  == the placement of orthodontic appliances creates a favorable environment for the accumulation of a microbiota and food residues, which, in time, may cause caries  or exacerbate any pre-existing periodontal disease. the purpose of the present study was to compare the total bacterial counts present on metallic and ceramic orthodontic brackets in order to clarify which bracket type has a higher plaque retaining capacity and to determine the levels of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp on both types of brackets. thirty-two metallic brackets and 24  ceramic brackets were collected from orthodontic patients at the day of debonding. two brackets were collected from each patient; one from a maxillary central incisor and another from a maxillary second premolar. sixteen patients who used metallic brackets and 12 patients who used ceramic brackets were sampled. bacterial populations were studied using "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization, which uses dna probes to identify species in complex microbial samples. the significance of differences between groups was determined using the  mann-whitney u-test. results showed no significant differences between metallic and ceramic brackets with respect to the caries-inducing s mutans and l acidophilus spp counts. mean counts of 8 of 35 additional species differed significantly between metallic and ceramic brackets with no obvious pattern favoring one bracket type over the other. this study showed higher mean counts of treponema denticola, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii, streptococcus anginosus, and eubacterium nodatum on metallic brackets while higher counts of eikenella corrodens, campylobacter showae, and selenomonas noxia were found on ceramic brackets.

TI  == contamination of interdental brushes by periodontopathogens.
AB  == experimental studies have shown that intraoral transmission of bacteria can occur. of course, the question arises as to how this transmission may happen. in  this study, the contamination of interdental brushes by periodontopathogens is examined and compared to the microbial load of the periodontal pockets. in ten untreated chronic periodontitis patients, four interdental sites were professionally brushed with one interdental brush per patient. subsequently, samples from the depths of the pockets (of the specific interdental sites) were obtained with paper-points. the interdental brush samples and the samples of the  subgingival plaque, obtained by the pooled paper-points, were processed for dark-field microscopy examination as well as anaerobic culturing. the results showed that, although significant differences could be found between the brushes  and paper-points with direct microscopy, the culturing did not uncover many differences. on the contrary, the detection frequencies of specific bacterial species were almost the same between the two. the total anaerobic colony-forming  units (cfu), p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and e. corrodens found on the brushes showed a significant correlation with the subgingival plaque samples (p<0.005). these results suggest that, in untreated situations, interdental brushes are contaminated relatively easily by putative periodontopathogens in numbers comparable to their presence in periodontal pockets. this contamination could be  a factor in the intraoral spread of bacteria.

TI  == clinical and microbiological studies of periodontal disease in sjogren syndrome patients.
AB  == background: little is known about the periodontal status of patients with sjogren's syndrome (ss), a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized  by xerophthalmia and xerostomia. the aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the periodontal status of ss patients, in terms of clinical and microbiological parameters, differs from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls. methods: 8 primary ss and 10 secondary ss patients were  examined in comparison with 11 control subjects. all patients were diagnosed by the european community criteria. control subjects were systemically healthy and not undergoing periodontal treatment. the comparison of clinical status was made  in terms of mean periodontal parameters (plaque index, gingival index, gingival recession, probing pocket depth, probing attachment level and bleeding on probing) as well as the frequency distribution of probing pocket depth and probing attachment level measurements. microbiological assays of the subgingival  dental plaque samples were carried out by both a chairside enzyme test (periocheck) for the detection of peptidase activity (pa) and a polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) analysis for 9 selected periodontal micro-organisms (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, streptococcus oralis). results: the  occurrence, severity and extent of periodontal lesions were not significantly different between the 3 patient groups for all periodontal parameters examined. no significant differences in the sub-gingival plaque samples from control, primary or secondary ss patients for the pa test, frequency or type of periodontal micro-organisms observed. conclusion: no significant differences could be detected in either clinical or microbiological parameters of primary or  secondary ss patients compared with that of control subjects. the results of the  present study thus support the notion that the periodontal status of patients with ss do not differ from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls.

TI  == the localization of periodontal-disease-associated bacteria in human periodontal  pockets.
AB  == some gram-negative anaerobes are associated with the incidence and progression of periodontal disease. in periodontal pockets, however, the localization of those bacteria is unknown. we investigated the localization of 5 bacterial species in human periodontal pockets. fifteen teeth with a part of periodontal pockets from  10 adult periodontitis patients were obtained, and the localization of bacteria was examined immunohistochemically. positive reactions with anti-prevotella nigrescens antibody were located at the epithelium-associated plaque area in the  middle pocket zones. in the middle and deep pocket zones, fusobacterium nucleatum and treponema denticola were especially localized in the unattached plaque area,  but eikenella corrodens was observed in the tooth-attached plaque area. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, detected in 2 of 15 samples examined, was found in the unattached plaque area, in the middle pocket zone. the present findings indicated that the 5 bacterial species examined localized at distinct regions in human periodontal pockets.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrite on periodontal bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial agent nitric oxide (no) is formed in the mouth and its concentration is directly related to salivary nitrite, which in turn is related to dietary nitrate intake. the aim of this study was to determine whether nitrite under acidic conditions will have an inhibitory effect, possibly occurring through no production, on the periodontal disease pathogens fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens and porphyromonas gingivalis. whereas the growth of these organisms was inhibited by a more acid ph, the addition of nitrite caused a marked, further dose-dependent reduction in bacterial numbers after exposure. the ability of these bacteria to recover from nitrite exposure was also affected by ph and nitrite concentration. at acidity levels below ph 5.0, low concentrations of nitrite (0.2 mm) caused effective complete killing of the periodontal bacteria. addition of sodium thiocyanate did not increase the bacteriostatic or bacteriocidal activity of acidified nitrite against any of the  3 bacteria. these results demonstrate the possibility that nitrite in saliva, under appropriate conditions, may have an effect on the growth and survival of the bacteria implicated in periodontal disease.

TI  == [bacterial virulence in the etiology of periodontal diseases].
AB  == strong relationships have been very often described between various form of periodontal disease (pd) and certain bacterial species, so that nowadays periodontal disease is recognized as an infectious disease. destruction of periodontal supporting tissues happens as a response to very intricate host-parasite interactions. when the clinician will be able to fully understand and identify such phenomena it would be possible to succeed in a properly diagnosis and control of the active phase of periodontal disease. the first step  in such a direction would be to analyze the common characteristic of some bacterial species, the so called suspected periodontopathogens. such species namely gram-negative, associated with the outbreak of periodontal disease have in common the capacity to disrupt the integrity of the host defences by means of the so called virulence factors. these factors may enhance the bacterial colonization or may interfere with the host response that ultimately results in periodontal support breakdown. the present review focuses on the virulence factors of the main suspected periodontopathogens evaluating the effects on the host immune response and directly on the periodontal tissues.

TI  == comparison of profiles of key periodontal pathogens in periodontium and endodontium.
AB  == despite the established anatomical relationship between the periodontal and pulpal tissues, bacterial migration between endodontium and periodontium is still under discussion. the objective of this study was an investigation of profiles of periodontal pathogens in pulpal and periodontal diseases affecting the same tooth by means of 16s rrna gene directed polymerase chain reaction (pcr). 31 intact teeth with both pulp and marginal infections were investigated. the diagnosis was based on clinical and radiological examination. samples were taken from the gingival sulcus or periodontal pocket, respectively, with sterile paper points before trepanation of the teeth. after trepanation sterile paper points and hedstroem files were used for taking samples from the root canal. specific pcr methods were used to detect the presence of the following pathogens: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola. in addition, quantitative competitive pcr was used to determine the total bacterial count of the samples. the investigated pathogens were proven to be present in the endondontium in all disease categories. particularly in endodontic samples of "chronic apical periodontitis" and "chronic adult periodontitis" profiles of the periodontal pathogens were found. the results confirmed that periodontal pathogens often accompany endodontic infections and supported the idea that the periodontic-endodontic interrelationships should be considered as critical pathways which might contribute to refractory courses of endodontic or periodontal diseases.

TI  == [clinical use of tetracyclines in the treatment of periodontal diseases].
AB  == introduction: there are a number of chemically different tetracycline homologues. the older group of tetracyclines, which was introduced in the 1950-60s, includes  tetracycline, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline and demeclocycline. the newer group of tetracyclines includes doxycycline, methacycline and minocycline. pharmacokinetics: elevated concentration of tetracycline in gingival fluid with respect to blood levels was an unexpected phenomenon. patients given 250 mg every 6 hours had average crevicular fluid concentrations between 4 to 8 g/ml and blood concentrations between 2 to 2.5 g/ml after 48 hours. the levels in crevicular fluid and blood of volunteers who received 250 mg every 12 hours were 2 to 4 g/ml and 0.3 to 1.4 g/ml respectively after 48 hours. the concentration of doxycycline in gingival fluid after administration of 200 mg/1st day and then 100 mg/day achieved average level of 6 g/ml. minocycline, a semisynthetic derivate of tetracycline, has shown to yield gingival fluid levels 5 times as high as serum levels after administration of 100 mg every 12 hours. mechanisms of action: tetracycline and its derivates demonstrate high in vitro activity against most periodontal bacteria, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, eikenella corrodens, wolinella recta and fusobacterium nucleatum. the study of in vitro susceptibility of these  6 bacterial strains showed that, in regard to blood level, minimal inhibitory concentration is higher and it is the concentration of the drug that can be expected in gingival fluid following oral administration of 100 mg per day (doxycycline) (table 1). the anti-inflammatory effect of tetracyclines was demonstrated histologically not only by reducing the size of the infiltrated connective tissue, but qualitative changes were also observed. golub and associates have presented evidence that tetracyclines inhibit collagenase activity in gingival fluid and in tissue cultures. therapeutic concentrations of  tetracycline inhibit chemotaxis, phagocytosis and random migration of neutrophils in vitro. adverse effects: great amounts of tetracyclines cause gastrointestinal  disorders, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. tetracyclines suppress activity of the  enzymes in the bowel and pancreas. during longlasting administration they can damage the liver and kidneys. tetracyclines can cause photo-sensibilization. they make deposits with calcium in bones, specially during prenatal period and during  growth, so they can cause permanent teeth discoloration and hypoplasia. interactions: the most important interaction is with penicillin. these two kinds  of antibiotics antagonize and decrease the therapeutic effect of each other, so their administration at the same time should be avoided. a significant interaction occurs between tetracyclines and metal ions. this interaction often has been observed in conjunction with use of various antacids. tetracyclines can  also influence the production and absorption of vitamin k. nephrotoxicity has been reported when tetracyclines have been administrated in conjunction with methoxyflurane. indications: doxycycline, due to its advantages over tetracycline (table 2), is indicated in treating destructive periodontal diseases including: juvenile periodontitis and refractory marginal periodontitis. doxycycline therapy may be used for acute periodontal abscess and if the conditions are accompanied by general symptoms. prophylactic application is recommended for implant placement procedures including membranes in guided tissue regeneration. results of clinical study: oral application: in spite of great number of published investigations this paper presents only the results of placebo-controlled, double-blind studies. there is evidence that therapy in localized juvenile periodontitis should eliminate actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, since 95% of patients harbored this bacteria.

TI  == photoactive porphyrin derivative with broad-spectrum activity against oral pathogens in vitro.
AB  == photodynamic therapy (pdt) has historically been used as a means to treat cancerous tumors but has recently been used to kill bacterial cells through the use of targeted photosensitizers. pdt is a potential adjunct to scaling and root  planing in the treatment of periodontal disease. however, the effectiveness of porphyrin derivatives against microorganisms has been limited because some gram-negative bacteria are refractory to photodynamic treatment with these agents. we have designed a porphyrin derivative conjugated to a pentalysine moeity that endows the molecule with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. whereas the porphyrin, chlorin e6, showed in vitro activity against a limited spectrum of bacteria, chlorin e6 conjugated to pentalysine showed in vitro activity against all oral microorganisms tested, including porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, actinomyces viscosus, and the streptococci. potent  antimicrobial activity (>/=5-log-unit reduction in the numbers of cfu per milliliter) was retained in the presence of up to 25% whole sheep blood. the use  of potent, selective agents such as this chlorin e6-pentalysine conjugate to more effectively reduce the pathogenic bacteria in the periodontal pocket may be a significant tool for the treatment of periodontal disease.

AB  == background: we explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum igg responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. methods: one hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients  aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject;  2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic dna probes. serum igg antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. results: cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of eikenella corrodens, veillonella  parvula, and actinomyces naeslundii in controls. cases displayed higher igg levels against p. gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against f. nucleatum, t. denticola, e. nodatum,  and capnocytophaga ochracea. positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. in cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species  out of which only one was positive (v. parvula). both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. a logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. conclusion: a combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.

TI  == periodontopathic bacteria in english hiv-seropositive persons.
AB  == selected periodontopathic bacteria were sought in 20 hiv-infected english patients and eight noninfected control subjects with similar periodontal status,  using highly specific dna probes. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a. a), porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum were more frequently detected and were found at higher levels in hiv-infected individuals than in controls. significantly increased levels of treponema denticola but, in contrast, lower levels of eikenella corrodens were found in nonbleeding sites of hiv-infected patients compared with  controls. the results of the present investigation on english patients suggest a  periodontopathogenic role for a. a, p. gingivalis and c. rectus, and possibly p.  intermedia and are in general accord with most previously reported data from the  united states. longitudinal studies are now required to determine more precisely  the association between periodontopathic microflora, immune competence and periodontal health and disease in hiv-infected persons.

TI  == interactions between periodontal bacteria and human oral epithelial cells: fusobacterium nucleatum adheres to and invades epithelial cells.
AB  == bacteria are causative agents of periodontal diseases. interactions between oral  bacteria and gingival epithelial cells are essential aspects of periodontal infections. using an in vitro tissue culture model, a selected group of gram-negative anaerobic bacteria frequently associated with periodontal diseases, including bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter curvus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia, were examined for their ability to adhere to and invade primary cultures of human gingival epithelial cells (hgec). the effects of these bacteria on the production of interleukin-8 (il-8), a proinflammatory chemokine, were also measured. these studies provided an initial demonstration that f. nucleatum adhered to and invaded hgec and that this was accompanied by high levels of il-8 secretion from  the epithelial cells. the attachment and invasion characteristics of f. nucleatum were also tested using kb cells, an oral epithelial cell line. the invasion was verified by transmission electron microscopy and with metabolic inhibitors. invasion appeared to occur via a "zipping" mechanism and required the involvement of actins, microtubules, signal transduction, protein synthesis, and energy metabolism of the epithelial cell, as well as protein synthesis by f. nucleatum.  a spontaneous mutant, lam, of f. nucleatum, isolated as defective in autoagglutination, was unable to attach to or invade hgec or kb cells, further indicating the requirement of bacterial components in these processes. sugar inhibition assays indicated that lectin-like interactions were involved in the attachment of f. nucleatum to kb cells. investigation of these new virulence phenotypes should improve our understanding of the role of f. nucleatum in periodontal infections.

TI  == the prevalence of pathogenic periodontal microflora in healthy young adult smokers.
AB  == background: smoking is a major risk factor in periodontitis, although the mechanisms of its effects are not well understood. the overall goal of this clinical study was to determine if smoking enhances the colonization of the oral  cavity by pathogenic bacteria in a periodontitis-free population. the prevalence  of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola was investigated in 25 smokers and 25 non-smokers by using dna probes. methods: the subjects were 21 to 35 years of  age with a healthy periodontium or slight gingivitis and were systemically healthy. the test group included subjects who had a minimum of a 1.5 pack-year history of smoking, while the control subjects never smoked. subgingival plaque samples were taken by paper point following the assessment of multiple clinical parameters. results: this investigation showed: 1) no statistically significant differences were noted in any clinical parameter measured between the groups; 2)  of the 8 subjects who were infected by at least 1 tested pathogen, seven were smokers (p= 0.02); 3) infected smokers had a 15.7+/-3.5 pack-year history and smoked a mean of 27+/-5 cigarettes/day versus 4.4+/-0.8 pack years and 15+/-1 cigarettes/day for the non-infected smokers (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.004); and 4) smokers were 18 times more likely to exhibit the presence of pathogens than non-smokers. conclusions: these data indicate that the prevalence of colonization of the sulcus by pathogenic bacterial species in periodontitis-free individuals is related to the quantity and duration of cigarette smoking.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  == eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. the aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). the samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. forty-one different microbial species were isolated. gemella morbillorum and peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while p. micros, streptococcus intermedius, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loeschei, p. melaninogenica and selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. the bacterial species s. constellatus, g. morbillorum and p. magnus were  isolated in greater numbers in incisors and p. micros, s. intermedius, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides egertheii, b. forsythus, p. oralis and s. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. cluster i was predominated by s. constellatus, s. mitis, s. sanguis, g. morbillorum, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; cluster ii was predominated by s. sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea and p. intermedia; cluster iii was predominated by s. mitis, c. ochracea, f. nucleatum,  p. loeschei, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; and finally cluster iv was predominated by s. sanguis, c. gingivalis, veillonella parvula, campylobacter gracilis, f. nucleatum and p. intermedia. the bacterial species s. constellatus,  p. micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, eikenella corrodens and f. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while s. intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.

TI  == comparing periodontal disease in identical twins: a case report.
AB  == previous investigators have shown that numerous environmental and genetic variables may contribute to the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. this case report presents clinical and laboratory findings of a set of caucasian female identical twins. one patient presented clinically with mild gingivitis and no clinical or radiographic signs of periodontitis. the other exhibited gingivitis with localized, moderate-to-severe periodontitis. neither patient reported a history of systemic conditions that might influence their periodontal health, and neither presented other known risk factors, such as tobacco use. the only apparent variable was related to their oral hygiene. the periodontally involved patient exhibited higher plaque scores than her twin in all clinical visits. subgingival plaque cultures revealed the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus only in the diseased twin. both patients had low colony counts of prevotella intermedia and eikenella corrodens, but only the healthy twin harbored small quantities of fusobacterium nucleatum. this case report offers an opportunity to assess etiology of periodontitis in two genetically identical patients whose only obvious difference was their oral hygiene.

TI  == longitudinal study of dental implants in a periodontally compromised population.
AB  == background: the purpose of this longitudinal study was to determine the clinical  status and the composition of the subgingival microbiota of dental implants and natural teeth in patients with a history of periodontitis. methods: twenty-five partially edentulous patients treated for moderate to advanced adult periodontitis and having a total of 42 implants participated in this 3-year study. the assessment of clinical status was done 1, 2, and 3 years after prosthetic loading (t1, t2, and t3, respectively). clinical parameters evaluated  included probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), gingival index (gi), and plaque index (pi). the subgingival microbiota at peri-implant and periodontal sites were analyzed at t1 and t2. results: no significant difference  in clinical parameters between implants and teeth and within the 2 groups between different time points was observed through the study. pd and cal measurements of  sampled periodontal and peri-implant sites did not show any statistically significant difference through the study and between the 2 groups. pi of sampled  periodontal sites showed a statistically significant improvement during the study. from the morphological observation of the subgingival microbiota, a significant difference in the composition of motile rods between implants and teeth was found at t1. there were no differences detected in the subgingival microbiota, culturally identified at peri-implant and periodontal sites for the duration of the study. conclusions: in conclusion, implants were colonized by the indigenous periodontal microbiota and were well maintained in patients with a history of periodontitis. no significant association between progressing or non-progressing periodontal or peri-implant sampled sites in terms of loss of attachment and infection with at least one of the searched periodontal pathogens  was found, suggesting that the presence of putative periodontopathogens at peri-implant and periodontal sites may not be associated with future attachment loss or implant failure.

TI  == microbiological features of papillon-lefevre syndrome periodontitis.
AB  == papillon-lefevre syndrome patients exhibit hyperkeratosis palmo-plantaris and severe periodontitis. the syndrome is an autosomal recessive trait, but the mechanism of periodontal destruction is not known. this report presents the clinical and microbiological features of an 11-year old girl with papillon-lefevre syndrome. clinical examination included conventional periodontal measurements and radiographic analysis. in samples from 3 deep periodontal lesions, the occurrence of major suspected periodontopathic bacteria was determined by selective and non-selective culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) identification, and the presence of cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr type 1 virus by a nested-pcr detection method. 10 of 22 available teeth demonstrated severe periodontal breakdown. major cultivable bacteria included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (3.4% of total isolates), prevotella nigrescens (16.4%), fusobacterium nucleatum (14.3%) and peptostreptococcus micros (10.6%). a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis and eikenella corrodens were identified by pcr analysis. the patient's non-affected parents and older brother revealed several periodontal pathogens but not a. actinomycetemcomitans. the viral examination demonstrated cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr type 1 virus in the subgingival sample of the papillon-lefevre syndrome patient. the father and brother yielded subgingival cytomegalovirus but  not epstein-barr type 1 virus. we hypothesize that human herpesviruses in concert with a. actinomycetemcomitans play important roles in the development of papillon-lefevre syndrome periodontitis.

TI  == microbiological response of localized sites with recurrent periodontitis in maintenance patients treated with tetracycline fibers.
AB  == background: whether adjunctive tetracycline fibers can provide an additive effect to scaling and root planing in treating non-responsive sites in maintenance subjects is still controversial. recolonization of the bacteria from untreated sites or from the extracrevicular region may explain the insignificant response to local therapy. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the microbiological response of sites treated with tetracycline fibers combined with  scaling and root planing. methods: the study was conducted in a split-mouth design. thirty patients on maintenance therapy having at least 2 non-adjacent sites in separate quadrants with probing depths between 4 to 8 mm with bleeding on probing, or aspartate aminotransferase enzyme levels > 800 microiu in the gingival crevicular fluid, were treated with scaling and root planing plus tetracycline fibers or with scaling and root planing only. subgingival plaque samples were collected at baseline, and 1, 3, and 6 months following treatment. a. actino-mycetemcomitans, c. rectus, b. forsythus, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, and p. intermedia were detected by culture, immunofluorescence, or pcr technique. results: there was a reduction of total bacterial cell count, as well as of certain periodontal pathogens, following treatment. the prevalence of  a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. forsythus, and p. gingivalis and the mean proportions of c. rectus, p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, and p. gingivalis decreased after therapy, but there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 treatment groups with respect to bacterial proportions or the number of positive sites. besides, the pathogens could not be eliminated from the periodontal pocket, and recolonization of the pocket was noted at 3 months post-treatment. conclusions: bacteria located within the cheek, tongue mucosa, saliva, or untreated sites may contribute to reinfection of the pockets and explain the insignificant response to local tetracycline therapy.

TI  == a 15-month evaluation of the effects of repeated subgingival minocycline in chronic adult periodontitis.
AB  == background: a double-blind, randomized, parallel, comparative study was designed  to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of subgingivally administered minocycline ointment versus a vehicle control. methods: one hundred four patients (104) with moderate to severe adult periodontitis (34 to 64 years of age; mean 46 years) were enrolled in the study. following scaling and root planing, patients were randomized to receive either 2% minocycline ointment or a matched vehicle control. study medication was administered directly into the periodontal pocket with a specially designed, graduated, disposable applicator at baseline; week 2;  and at months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12. scaling and root planing was repeated at months 6 and 12. standard clinical variables (including probing depth and attachment level) were evaluated at baseline and at months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15. microbiological sampling using dna probes was done at baseline; at week 2; and at months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15. results: both treatment groups showed significant  and clinically relevant reductions in the numbers of each of the 7 microorganisms measured during the entire 15-month study period. when differences were detected, sites treated with minocycline ointment always produced statistically significantly greater reductions than sites which received the vehicle control. for initial pockets > or =5 mm, a mean reduction in probing depth of 1.9 mm was seen in the test sites, versus 1.2 mm in the control sites. sites with a baseline probing depth > or =7 mm and bleeding index >2 showed an average of 2.5 mm reduction with minocycline versus 1.5 mm with the vehicle. gains in attachment (0.9 mm and 1.1 mm) were observed in minocycline-treated sites, with baseline probing depth > or =5 mm and > or =7 mm, respectively, compared with 0.5 mm and 0.7 mm gain at control sites. subgingival administration of minocycline ointment  was well tolerated. conclusions: overall, the results demonstrate that repeated subgingival administration of minocycline ointment in the treatment of adult periodontitis is safe and leads to significant adjunctive improvement after subgingival instrumentation in both clinical and microbiologic variables over a 15-month period.

TI  == periodontal bacteria in adult twins.
AB  == background: both environmental and genetic factors are known to influence clinical measures of periodontal disease. the purpose of this study was to determine whether genetic factors similarly influence the presence of specific periodontal bacteria in subgingival plaque. methods: reared-together and reared-apart monozygous (mz) and dizygous (dz) adult twins were examined clinically. demographic and behavioral information was obtained from each subject by questionnaire. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from the index teeth,  and the presence of p. intermedia, p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, e. corrodens, and f. nucleatum was determined using an immunoassay. results: microbiological and clinical data were available for 169 twin pairs. the subject-based prevalences of the bacteria in the twin groups ranged from 11% for  porphyromonas gingivalis to 40% for f. nucleatum. for all species examined, the concordance rates were not significantly different (p > 0.05) between mz and dz twin groups. these findings were apparent despite similar smoking histories, self-reported oral hygiene practices, and antibiotic use in the twin groups. furthermore, mz twins reared together were not more similar than mz reared-apart  twins with respect to any bacterial species examined. conclusions: these findings suggest that in a population with access to routine dental care, any effects that host genes and the early family environment have on the presence of specific bacteria in subgingival plaque are not apparent in adulthood. most twins with disease in this study had early periodontitis. results from this study may not necessarily be extrapolated to more advanced disease states.

AB  == background: the aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between  the occurrence of certain specific periodontal pathogens and aspartate aminotransferase (ast) levels in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf). methods: thirty systemically healthy subjects with moderate to advanced periodontitis were selected. within each subject, the ast contents of gcf from sites with probing depth between 5 mm and 7 mm were measured using a chairside colorimetric test. ast-positive site refers to one that had an ast level > or = 800 microiu. subgingival plaque samples from one ast-positive and one negative site were collected for microbiological examination. one site with probing depth < or = 3 mm and no gingival inflammation was selected as a healthy control. clinical parameters of the chosen sites, including the plaque index and gingival index scores, probing depth, and clinical attachment level were measured. culture and immunofluorescence (if) were used for detecting common periodontal pathogens, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga species, prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, and porphyromonas gingivalis. logistic regression was used to analyze the correlation between the ast test and certain specific pathogens. results: the gcf scores and  total cultivable bacterial counts were higher in ast-positive sites than either ast-negative or healthy sites. the prevalence and proportions of specific periodontal pathogens such as c rectus, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, capnocytophaga species, p. intermedia, and p. gingivalis were significantly higher in positive than in negative sites. in analyzing the correlation of the proportion of 6 pathogens with the ast test by logistic regression, only p. gingivalis showed a significant positive correlation. the odds ratio of having a  high proportion of p. gingivalis in the presence of a positive ast test was 1.21. conclusions: the present study showed that at ast-positive sites, there is a higher prevalence and higher proportion of certain periodontal pathogens. although only the correlation of p. gingivalis and ast values was statistically significant, the results imply that certain periodontal pathogens may be associated with elevation of ast levels in gcf.

AB  == serum antibody specificity to oral micro-organisms was used to delineate the pathogens associated with early-onset periodontal diseases in a turkish population. additionally, comparison of the findings to those derived from a clinically similar us patient population described differences in bacterial specific antibody between these 2 geographic regions. serum from 89 (ljp), 86 (rpp) and 94 (normal) subjects was analyzed (elisa) to determine igg antibody to  14 oral micro-organisms. all ljp patients from turkey exhibited elevated antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotypes c and a significantly increased), while antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 and jp2 (serotype b) were significantly higher in us ljp patients. 50% of the turkish rpp patients also showed elevated anti-a. actinomycetemcomitans antibody, although the us rpp patients exhibited significantly higher antibody levels and frequency of elevated antibody to the a. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes. healthy subjects and ljp and  rpp patients from the us exhibited higher antibody levels to all 3 p. gingivalis  serogroups compared to those from turkey, although, the frequency of elevated antibody to the p. gingivalis serogroups was significantly higher in ljp and rpp  patients from turkey than from the us. interestingly, 87% and 77% of the ljp patients in the turkish population had elevated antibody responses to p. gingivalis and e. corrodens, respectively, which was not observed in the us ljp patients. these data suggested that considerable variation exists in the systemic antibody levels to periodontopathogens between these 2 countries. this supports potential differences in subgingival colonization or antigenic composition of these pathogens between patient populations from different geographical regions.

TI  == early-onset periodontitis associated with down's syndrome--clinical interventional study.
AB  == individuals with down's syndrome (ds) have an increased prevalence of periodontal disease compared with otherwise normal, age-matched control groups and other mentally handicapped patients of similar age distribution. the exaggerated immune-inflammatory response of the tissues cannot be explained by poor oral hygiene alone and might be the result of an impaired cell-mediated and humoral immunity and a deficient phagocytic system. as far as the progression and severity of destruction, the oral manifestations of ds patients are consistent with the juvenile periodontitis (jp) disease pattern. the purpose of the present  study was 1) to assess the periodontal clinical and microbiological status of 10  ds patients aged 20 to 31 years (mean: 26.3 years) relative to that of 11 patients with cerebral palsy (cp) aged 23 to 53 years (mean: 36 years) without defective immunological functions, and 2) to determine the effect of supragingival plaque control and oral hygiene instruction in these patient groups. subsequent to the initial examination and a professional tooth cleaning program, clinical and microbiological parameters were monitored over a period of  12 weeks. the clinical examination included the recording of plaque index (p1), gingival index (gi), probing depth (pd), and clinical attachment level (cal). subgingival plaque samples were always obtained from the same pocket with the highest disease activity (deepest bleeding site at baseline examination) in each  subject for a morphotype analysis by dark field microscopy and for identification and quantitation of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, and campylobacter rectus by dna probes. the results of the baseline examinations demonstrated that ds patients and patients with cerebral palsy had inflamed gingiva associated with a high amount of plaque. the mean probing depth and percentage of sites with probing depth> 4 mm corresponded to age and poor oral hygiene in cp patients. deep pockets in ds patients demonstrated a high prevalence of periodontal disease compared with age-matched children with mental retardation and non-handicapped patients. regarding the young age of onset, the severe destruction of periodontal tissues and pathogenesis of periodontitis in ds patients are consistent with the  juvenile periodontitis disease pattern. the missing clinical benefit and alteration of the subgingival flora following supragingival plaque control in ds  patients underlined the alteration in the immunological response.

AB  == the prevalence of 18 selected bacterial species was assessed by means of "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridisation in a group of 12 saudi-arabian adolescents with papillon-lefevre syndrome. a total of 36 tooth sites were investigated. the  patients exhibited severe periodontal disease with deep pockets. all 12 patients  harboured the putative bacterial pathogens p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, p. micros and s. intermedius while t. denticola, b. forsythus, p. nigrescens, e. corrodens, s. noxia and c. rectus were recovered from 11 patients. p. gingivalis was recovered from 9 patients and 18 sites while corresponding figures for a. actinomycetemcomitans were 8 and 19, respectively. a number of the investigated species (b. forsythus, t. denticola, p. intermedia, c rectus) reached high levels (> or =10(6) cells) in more than 1/2 of the patients. on the other hand, bacteria such as a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were infrequently encountered  at high levels in these subgingival samples. in conclusion, the analysis failed to demonstrate a pls-specific profile of the subgingival infection, since the bacterial composition of the sampled sites closely resembled that characterising  deep pockets in adult periodontitis patients.

TI  == severity of localized juvenile periodontitis as related to polymorphonuclear chemotaxis and specific microbial isolates.
AB  == the purpose of this study was twofold: (a) to determine if an association exists  between severity of localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp) and impairment of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (pmn) chemotaxis and/or colonization by specific microbial isolates; (b) to determine if the number of specific microbial isolates, i.e., actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, and campylobacter rectus correlates to clinical severity of sites with ljp. thirty-six first molars in nine subjects with ljp were examined. a clinical severity score was computed based on attachment level and vertical bone loss. the mean score of the four sites was designated as the clinical severity score for each subject. a dna probe was used to quantitate colonization by a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, e. corrodens,  and c. rectus. the chemotaxis of isolated peripheral blood pmns was measured in boyden chambers using the leading front technique. it was found that the clinical severity score ranged from 7.8 for mild involvement to 32.5 for severe ljp. the chemotaxis result for each patient (micron/90 min) was expressed as a percentage  of the value for a paired healthy control and ranged from 40% to 104%. four of the nine subjects had chemotaxis values less than 70% of control. linear regression analysis showed: (a) no significant correlation between pmn chemotaxis and severity of ljp in subjects (r = .14); (b) a significant correlation (r = 0.43) between severe sites with ljp and number of specific microbial isolates. sites with severe ljp had present at least five different microbial isolates as compared with non-severe sites (p < .05). no particular trend of colonization by  periodontopathogens was seen in non-severe sites. further, severe sites of ljp displayed a statistically significant greater colonization by p. intermedia, e. corrodens, and c. rectus than did non-severe sites (p < .05). it may be concluded that neither the degree of pmn chemotactic impairment nor a. actinomycetemcomitans is a reliable indicator of the severity of ljp.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution of several periodontopathic bacteria in adult periodontitis, their in vitro susceptibility to minocycline-hcl, and whether the efficacy of the drug changes with a decrease  in bacterial susceptibility. twenty-one patients (43 to 75 years old) with 62 periodontal lesions from pockets > or =4 mm participated in the study. after subgingival sampling, an ointment containing 2% minocycline-hcl was applied locally to the selected pockets once a week for 4 weeks. the lesions were clinically examined after 1 and 4 weeks of administration. the distribution of the subgingival microorganisms included capnocytophaga sputigena (37.1%), prevotella intermedia (22.6%), porphyromonas gingivalis (22.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum (20.1%), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (9.7%), and eikenella corrodens (4.8%). the distribution was complex, with 76.8% of the sites containing 1 to 3 bacterial spieces. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of minocycline-hcl for each organism showed that most were inhibited by a minocycline-hcl concentration equal to or less than the mic for reference strains. however, some clinical strains of prevotella intermedia seemed to exihibit low susceptibility to minocycline-hcl. there were no significant differences among sites with strains exhibiting low or normal susceptibility to minocycline-hcl. the concentration of the drug applied to deep periodontal pockets inhibited the growth of most of the microorganisms investigated in this study.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == subgingival temperature: relation to gingival crevicular fluid enzymes, cytokines, and subgingival plaque micro-organisms.
AB  == there have been no reports on the relationship of subgingival temperature to specific gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) components. therefore, the purpose of this cross-sectional study was to determine whether there was any relationship between subgingival temperature and gcf levels of neutrophil elastase (ne), myeloperoxidase (mpo), beta-glucuronidase (bg), interleukin-1 alpha (il-1), and interferon alpha (ifn). furthermore, another objective was to confirm an association of subgingival temperature with clinical parameters and specific subgingival plaque micro-organisms as has been reported earlier. 27 human subjects each having healthy (n = 50), gingivitis (n = 59) and periodontitis (n = 53) sites were evaluated. the plaque index (pi), subgingival temperature, probing depth, attachment loss, bleeding index and gingival index were measured. gcf was  sampled following the measurement of the pi and removal of the supragingival plaque. gcf samples were assayed for the enzymes ne, bg, mpo and the cytokines ifn-alpha and il-1 alpha. a sterile gracey curette was utilized at each sampled site to collect subgingival plaque. the plaque samples were evaluated using an immunoassay. subgingival temperature was found to directly correlate with all clinical parameters (p < 0.001). significant, albeit not large, correlations were found between subgingival temperature and ne (r = 0.35, p < 0.001), mpo (r = 0.26, p < 0.001) and bg (r = 0.23, p < 0.01). temperature was found to correlate  positively with e. corrodens (r = 0.33, p < 0.02) and f. nucleatum (r = 0.25, p < 0.05) but not with p. intermedia (r = 0.02, p = 0.9), p. gingivalis (r = 0.20, p  = 0.1) and a. actinomycetemcomitans (r = 0.01, p > 0.9). in conclusion, subgingival temperature is correlated with the gcf enzymes, ne, mpo and bg as well as the clinical parameters and specific plaque micro-organisms associated with periodontal disease.

TI  == "checkerboard" versus culture: a comparison between two methods for identification of subgingival microbiota.
AB  == the present study compared the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization methodology with culture techniques for the analysis of the composition of the subgingival microbiota. 70 subjects, presenting with a variety of periodontal conditions, contributed with a total of 283 subgingival plaque samples analyzed with respect  to the following species: porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus,  eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans. species identification and quantification was performed by (i) the checkerboard method, using whole genomic, digoxigenin labeled dna probes; and (ii) culture, including non-selective and selective media in combination with routine biochemical testing using commercial  test panels. we found that the checkerboard technology resulted in higher prevalence figures for half of the species tested when compared to culture data.  if the latter were used as the reference, checkerboard detection sensitivities ranged from 0.17 to 0.86, specificities from 0.17 to 1.0, and diagnostic accuracies from 0.51 to 0.81, depending on bacterial species. the use of the checkerboard data as the reference resulted in detection sensitivities for the culture procedures between 0.24 and 1.0 and specificities between 0.21 and 0.87.  the checkerboard methodology resulted in statistically significant higher bacterial counts for the majority of the species. it was further observed that, for most species, the higher the total number colony-forming units in the sample, the higher the discrepancy between the results obtained by the two techniques.

TI  == putative periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque of young adults with and without early-onset periodontitis.
AB  == this study assessed the associations between putative periodontal pathogens and early-onset periodontitis (eop) in a population of 248 subjects, 13 to 19 years of age at baseline, derived from a representative sample of u.s. young adults. the subjects were selected based on the presence or absence of attachment loss at baseline. the attachment level was assessed clinically at baseline and at a 6-year follow-up examination, and the presence of 7 bacterial species was assessed at follow-up using dna probes. the individuals were classified into generalized, localized, incidental eop, and no-periodontitis groups based on the  extent and severity of attachment loss; and classified as having rapid, moderate, slow, and no progression based on the rate of periodontal progression during the  6 preceding years. in the eop groups there were significantly higher percentages  of individuals with detectable levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, and treponema denticola. in addition, the eop group had significantly higher levels of these 5  microorganisms compared to the no-periodontitis group. there were also higher percentages of individuals with these species and higher levels of bacteria in the group showing disease progression than the group without progression. in a descending order of importance, p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and p. intermedia were the microorganisms significantly associated with the generalized and/or rapidly progressing disease. f. nucleatum and c. rectus were also associated with eop, but to a lesser degree. in the present population actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was not significantly associated with eop, though it was recovered more often from subjects with localized eop. eikenella corrodens was present equally in subjects with and without disease. the results show that several bacterial species are associated with eop, and that p. gingivalis and t.  denticola are of particular importance and may play a significant role in the more severe and progressive forms of eop.

TI  == cross-infection from periodontitis sites to failing implant sites in the same mouth.
AB  == twenty-five tooth and implant sites in nine patients were investigated for the presence of putative periodontopathic organisms, using specific dna probes for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, and campylobacter recta. five of nine patients showed a likelihood of transmission from tooth to implant sites. these patients also showed a high number of putative periodontopathic organisms present in the tooth sites tested.  a significant risk was found of transmitting putative periodontopathic organisms  from periodontitis sites to implant sites in the same mouth. an appropriate clinical protocol needs to be developed to address this issue.

TI  == microbial findings of deep peri-implant bone defects.
AB  == the objective of this study was to examine inflammatory tissue in deep peri-implant bone pockets (> 5 mm) for anaerobic bacteria colonization. the peri-implant inflammatory tissue of bone defects from 12 edentulous patients with 18 unsuccessful implants (imz type) was removed after surgical opening of the defects. after grinding the tissue with glass beads in nutrient solution, an aliquot of the suspension was plated and incubated on appropriate culture media.  the quantitative and qualitative distribution of bacteria as a function of the tissue dry weight was determined (cell count/mg dry weight). the mean total cell  count was 67 x 10(3) cells/mg dry weight. the following bacteria dominated: species of the family bacteroidaceae (prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, prevotella oralis, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella denticola); actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; fusobacterium nucleatum; capnocytophaga spp; and eikenella corrodens. bacteroidaceae and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were found particularly frequently. the increased colonization of these bacteria in deep peri-implant bone pockets is consistent with the currently held view of advanced periodontal lesions, whereby certain pathogens grow at a disproportionate rate in comparison with the total bacteria count under specific circumstances.

TI  == short-chain carboxylic acid concentration in human gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == short-chain carboxylic acids (e.g., lactic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid) are metabolic by-products of bacterial metabolism which can accumulate in the gingival crevice. it is of no small consequence, therefore, that 1- to 5-mm concentrations of these acids exhibit significant biological activity, including  the ability to alter cell proliferation and gene expression in cells of importance to the periodontium. this communication reports on the in vivo concentrations of propionic and butyric acid in the gingival crevices of periodontal subjects with severe and mild disease. the results indicated that severely diseased subjects exhibited a > 10-fold increase in the mm concentration of these acids when compared with mildly diseased subjects (mean propionic acid-severe = 9.5 +/- 1.8 mm, and mild = 0.8 +/- 0.3 mm; mean butyric acid-severe = 2.6 +/- 0.4 mm, and mild = 0.2 +/- 0.04 mm). these differences (mean +/- se) were significant (p < 0.0001). the propionic and butyric acid concentrations were below detection limits in healthy sites of mildly diseased subjects. the propionic and butyric acid concentrations also associated significantly with clinical measures of disease severity (e.g., pocket depth, attachment level) and  inflammation (e.g., subgingival temperature, % of sites bleeding when probed), and with the total microbial load (all p < 0.05). taken together, these data suggest that short-chain carboxylic acids play a mediating role in periodontal disease pathogenesis.

TI  == the influence of periodontitis on the subgingival flora around implants in partially edentulous patients.
AB  == the hypothesis that teeth act as reservoirs of micro-organisms for the colonization of oral implants has recently been stated several times. the present study aimed at examining, in partially edentulous patients with severe periodontitis, whether pockets around teeth and implants harbored a comparable micro-flora. in 6 patients (3 with refractory periodontitis and 3 with advanced chronic adult periodontitis), plaque samples were taken from a deep and shallow pocket around both teeth and implants for differential phase contrast microscopy  and dna probe analysis. the results showed important differences in the sub-gingival flora between the 2 disease groups, as well as between deep and shallow pockets, around both implants and teeth. on the other hand, when pockets  around teeth and implants with equal depths were compared a striking similarity was observed in the microbial composition. these observations confirm the hypothesis that pockets around teeth act as a reservoir and highlight the importance of periodontal health when oral implants are planned.

TI  == the adherence of periodontopathogens to periodontal probes. a possible factor in  intra-oral transmission?
AB  == periodontal probes have previously been shown to harbor several bacterial types or species after probing periodontally diseased pockets. this study aims to identify and quantify periodontopathogens that may adhere to a periodontal probe  by culturing techniques. it also examines the probe's roughness on its capability to collect bacteria, comparing merrit-b probes (with deep indentations) with tps  probes (with smooth surfaces). from the differential phase contrast microscopy findings it was seen that, while paper-points harbored nearly 50% motile rods or  spirochetes, the periodontal probes were just at, or below, the 20% threshold level for pathogenicity (23.6% for the merrit-b probe and 11.3% for the tps probe). the cultural data showed that paper-points had significantly higher (p <  0.05) numbers of anaerobic bacteria than the 2 probe types, which still harbored  up to 10(7) cfu. no significant differences could be detected between the probes. when specific periodontopathic species were considered, it was seen that for all  species, even for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or porphyromonas gingivalis, the detection frequency was comparable for the 3 sampling devices. however, the levels of prevotella intermedia and campylobacter rectus was significantly higher in samples from paper-points (p < 0.05), but still their numbers reached even 10(5) on the probes. differences among the 2 probe types were again negligible. periodontal probes harbor relatively high numbers of bacteria found in periodontal pockets and may be able to carry them over to other sites. further studies are needed to determine if, and to what extent, transmission occurs during periodontal probing.

TI  == risk indicators for periodontal disease in a racially diverse urban population.
AB  == a cross-sectional study of 117 subjects from a dental clinic serving a diverse population (i.e., whites, african-americans, native-americans, and asians) was performed to evaluate risk indicators of periodontal disease. gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) and subgingival plaque were taken at the same visit from 4 posterior  sites of the most diseased sextant in each subject. age, smoking packyears, beta-glucuronidase (beta g), neutrophil elastase (ne), myeloperoxidase (mpo), fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum), and porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) were significantly (p < 0.05-0.005) correlated with attachment loss.  probing depth was significantly correlated with smoking packyears, beta g, ne, mpo, f. nucleatum and prevotella intermedia (p. intermedia) (p < 0.05-0.005). mean ne value of whites was lower than the mean ne values of african-americans, native-americans and asians (p < 0.05). whites had a lower mean beta g value compared to african americans, and a lower mean mpo value compared to african americans and native americans. the %s of patients positive for f. nucleatum, p.  intermedia and eikenella corrodens (e. corrodens) were higher in native americans compared to whites. step-wise multiple regression analysis was performed to construct models for the estimation of probing depth and attachment loss. the most parsimonious regression models which had the best r2 values included the following variables and accounted for the indicated % of variability: models 1 and 2: beta g, race, and f. nucleatum accounted for 50% of the variability in mean probing depth and 39% of the variability in a single site (first molar) for  probing depth, respectively; model 3: age, beta g, and f. nucleatum accounted for 53% of the variability in mean attachment loss; model 4: age, ne, and f. nucleatum explained 35% of the variability in a single site (first molar) for attachment loss. the results suggest that age, race, smoking packyears, beta g, ne, mpo, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and p. intermedia are risk indicators for periodontal disease in this racially diverse urban population. regression models  which include multiple variables (i.e., demographic factors, gcf enzymes and periodontopathic bacteria) can be used to estimate periodontal disease status.

TI  == the relationship of gingival crevicular fluid short chain carboxylic acid concentration to gingival inflammation.
AB  == short-chain carboxylic acids (scca; c < or = 5; e.g., lactic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid) are metabolic by-products of bacterial metabolism which accumulate in the gingival crevice, and exhibit significant biological activity,  including the ability to alter gene expression. it has been hypothesized that among the activities of sccas are their ability to contribute to gingival inflammation. this concept complements the notion that specific periodontal pathogens are the causative agents of gingival inflammation. to begin testing these 2 hypotheses, we examined the relationship between scca concentrations, specific putative periodontal pathogens, and gingival inflammation in medically healthy periodontally diseased subjects. we reasoned that if sccas and/or specific periodontal pathogens were causative gingival inflammatory agents, gingival inflammation should increase with increasing concentration of the inflammatory mediator. we also recognized that other clinical variables needed to be controlled for, and an objective quantitative assessment of gingival inflammation used. to accomplish these tasks, sites within subjects were stratified by location and pocket depth, and the following quantified: bacterial  presence; scca concentration; and gingival inflammation. the results indicated that gingival inflammation directly and significantly correlated with scca concentrations in the maxillary and mandibular molars, incisors and canines (all  r > or = 0.47; all p < or = 0.015; too few bicuspids were available for complete  analysis). the relationship between gingival inflammation and scca concentration  was best described by a natural log relationship. gingival inflammation did not,  however, correlate positively with either the total number of specific putative periodontal pathogens, or the sum of subsets of these pathogens (-0.31 < or = r < or = 0.39; 0.08 < or = p < or = 0.75) for any of the locations. finally, the scca concentration did not correlate with the level of individual or groups of pathogens. these data, together with historical work and other preliminary data,  support the hypothesis that scca, rather than specific putative periodontal pathogens, may be a causative agent in gingival inflammation. this work may, in part, begin to explain the apparent lack of a direct relationship between current gingival inflammation and the prediction of bacterially mediated periodontal attachment loss.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to assess the clinical effect of treatment aimed to suppress actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis below  detection level and prevotella intermedia below 5% of the cultivable periodontal  pocket flora. sixteen patients and a total of 111 periodontal pockets with probing depth > or = 6 mm were included in the study. twelve patients and a total of 77 sites completed the 5-year study. the results demonstrated clinical improvement of probing depth and gain of clinical attachment level of 3.4 mm and  1.2 mm, respectively. treatment to eliminate indicator bacteria continued for 3 years before the aim was fulfilled. in order to eliminate a. actinomycetemcomitans from a majority of the sites, a combination of surgery and  generalized tetracycline treatment was performed. a recolonization or regrowth of the indicator bacteria exceeding detection levels took place in several sites. the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans. p. gingivalis, and p. intermedia, alone or in combination, correlated with attachment level change on the individual level. no such correlation was obtained by using presence of plaque, bleeding on  probing, or three other bacteria (campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, and  fusobacterium nucleatum) not used as treatment goal markers.

AB  == the present study was carried out to examine the distribution of six periodontopathic bacteria in deep periodontal pockets and to reconfirm the effect of periocline on these periodontopathic bacteria. samples from sixty-two periodontal pockets were collected at pocket depths of over 4 mm in twenty-one periodontitis patients aged 43 to 75 years. after sampling, periocline was applied topically to the selected pockets once a week for four weeks and reexamined. the detected rates of the periodontopathic bacteria were capnocytophaga sputigena (37.1%), prevotella intermedia (22.6%), porphyromonas gingivalis (22.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum (20.1%), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (9.7%) and eikenella corrodens (4.8%). the distribution of  the bacteria was compound because two or three bacterial species were found to coexist. in view of the mic of minocycline-hci for these bacteria, increase of most of the measured bacteria was suppressed by the concentration of drugs, including periocline. however, clinical strains of p. i. were considered to have  low susceptibility to minocycline-hcl. in view of the effect of topical application of drugs, no significant differences were found. from these results,  it was suggested that periocline contained effective concentration of minocycline-hcl.

AB  == serum igg antibody titers to 7 periodontopathic bacteria in periodontitis patients were measured at the 1st visit and after various periodontal treatments  with clinically successful improvement, in order to evaluate what kind of factors are associated with changes of serum antibody titers. 20 patients (10 male and 10 female from 23 to 61 years old) with adult, rapidly progressive periodontitis were enrolled in this study. all patients received initial preparation and most of them also underwent surgical procedure. after the treatments, the mean probing pocket depths decreased from 3.72 mm to 1.56 mm. serum samples were collected from patients at the initial and final examinations. serum igg antibody titers against sonicated antigens of porphyromonas gingivalis fdc 381, prevotella intermedia atcc 25611, prevotella loescheii atcc 15930, fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies nucleatum atcc 25586, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans fdc y4, eikenella corrodens fdc 1073 and capnocytophaga ochracea # m 12 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the mean antibody titers to p. gingivalis and p. intermedia decreased significantly after the treatment as compared to their pretreatment levels. the antibody titer to p. gingivalis, especially, decreased in all of the patients examined. a significant relationship was found between the decreased antibody titer to p. gingivalis and the number of teeth which received periodontal surgery, as well as treatment length, and the relationship between the decreased antibody titer to p. intermedia and the number of extracted teeth was also significant. these results suggest that the changes of serum igg titers against p. gingivalis and p. intermedia are related to the suppression of such pathogens in subgingival plague.

TI  == molecular and immunological characterization of a 64-kda protein of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == the 64-kda protein to which about half the sera from patients with localized juvenile periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis reacted strongly was purified from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4. determination of the n-terminal sequence of the protein revealed that it was a groel-like protein. the dna fragment containing the groel gene of a. actinomycetemcomitans was amplified  by polymerase chain reaction, and the groesl operon was cloned by using colony hybridization with the amplified fragment from a. actinomycetemcomitans chromosomal dna. sequence analysis revealed that structures of the operon and its products were typical in gram-negative bacteria. rabbit polyclonal antibodies to  the 64-kda protein cross-reacted with approximately 65-kda proteins of haemophilus aphrophilus, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus paraphrophilus, escherichia coli and eikenella corrodens but not with any cellular proteins of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. it is possible that antibodies reactive to the 64-kda protein in periodontitis patients are induced by the cross-reactivity with the hsp60 proteins of other bacteria.

TI  == some suspected periodontopathogens and serum antibody response in adult long-duration insulin-dependent diabetics.
AB  == the subgingival microflora and serum antibody response were examined in long-duration insulin-dependent diabetics and age- and sex-matched non-diabetics. the material consisted of 9 diabetics aged 40-49 years and 19 aged 50-59 years, 13 non-diabetics aged 40-49 years and 21 aged 50-59 years. the bacterial species  studied (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga spp, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia) were recovered in diabetics as well as in non-diabetics. significantly more diabetics in both age groups harboured p. gingivalis compared to non-diabetics. prevalence of p. gingivalis was associated  with deepened periodontal pockets among non-diabetics but not among diabetics. in diabetics and non-diabetics, the serum antibody titres for most antigens were similar.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of cefotaxime tested against infrequently isolated pathogenic species (unusual pathogens).
AB  == the cefotaxime sodium spectrum of activity is very broad and includes many common species and a variety of less frequently isolated pathogens. we have reviewed the clinical microbiology literature (44 references) and the data base of the university of iowa hospitals and clinics (iowa city, ia) to collect data on the activity of cefotaxime against the less common species. cefotaxime was consistently active against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga  spp., eikenella corrodens, erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, pasteurella multocida, plesiomonas shigelloides, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the species alcaligenes xylosoxidans, flavobacterium spp., stenotrophomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, and rhodococcus equi were uniformly cefotaxime resistant. for many other species there was considerable variation in  reported minimum inhibitory concentrations. these data may be helpful in guiding  therapy of unusual infections, particularly in the case of fastidious species, where the appropriate susceptibility testing methodology may not be immediately or routinely available.

TI  == succession of putative peri-implant pathogens after root-form and plate-form implant placement in partially dentate adult monkeys.
AB  == this report describes the succession of putative peri-implant pathogens in partially dentate monkeys after dental implantation and prosthetic reconstruction. tooth and implant (6 root-end form, 4 blade-vent implants) sites  in eight monkeys were monitored microbiologically and clinically during the pre-implant stage, abutment connection stage, bridge placement stage, and three and six months after the bridge placement stage. tooth and implant sites were cleaned monthly post-extraction. microbiological studies included dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and primary phenotypic characterization of culture isolates. after implant surgery, the median proportion of several putative peri-implant pathogens studied were significantly  elevated. following fixture placement, p. intermedia replaced p. melaninogenica as the predominant black pigmented anaerobic bacilli (bpab) in the mouth. after abutment connection stage, levels of p. intermedia, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f.  nucleatun, haemophilus sp. and spirochetes were significantly elevated at implant and tooth sites. three months after bridge installations, p. intermedia and a. actinomycetemcomitans remained significantly elevated at implant sites. at six months after bridge installation, levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans declined significantly relative to levels at three months.  porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes were not significantly elevated although their  levels correlated with gingival redness. p. intermedia, porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes levels correlated significantly with probing depth. correlation was detected between p. gingivalis and spirochetes; and between a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum. our studies show a transitional increase  in levels of several organisms resembling putative pathogens of human peri-implant infection, associated with implant placements in partially edentulous mouths and supports early prophylactic interventions to control their  levels.

TI  == in-vitro antibacterial effects of extracts of nigerian tooth-cleaning sticks on periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == aqueous extracts from 8 plants used for tooth-cleaning in nigeria were tested for their ability to inhibit the growth of five periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens and campylobacter rectus. extracts of all the plants except that of massularia acuminata exhibited varying growth inhibitory potentials on the microorganisms. extract of terminalia glaucescens showed the widest spectrum  of activity, inhibiting the growth of all the tested bacteria except p. gingivalis. these findings corroborate other studies that the plants possess antiplaque properties and suggest that they may be useful tools in preventive dentistry in poor developing countries. however, the bioavailability of the active ingredients of the plants and their long term effects in vivo need to be investigated.

AB  == the production of hsp by periodontopathic gram-negative bacteria was examined by  sds-page, two dimensional gel electrophoresis, and western blotting using monoclonal antibodies against hsps. strains of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica, and treponema socranskii species produced hsp which reacted with anti-yersinia enterocolitica hsp 60 and/or mycobacterial 65-kda hsp monoclonal antibodies. it found that gingival homogenate samples from patients with adult periodontitis reacted with anti-human hsp were also found in a serum sample from a periodontitis patient. the present study suggests that hsps are implicated in human periodontal disease  process.

TI  == the gingival immune response to periodontal pathogens in juvenile periodontitis.
AB  == a gingival explant culture system was utilized to evaluate the reactivity of local immunoglobulins produced by juvenile periodontitis tissue. gingival explant culture supernatant fluids were screened, via a standardized dot-immunobinding assay, for antibodies reactive to: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, eikenella  corrodens, peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, capnocytophaga ochracea, eubacterium nodatum and fusobacterium nucleatum and one  nonoral microorganism, porphyromonas asaccharolytica. of the 75 juvenile periodontitis supernatant fluids tested, the organisms that reacted with the highest numbers of supernatant fluids were e. nodatum (72%) and a. actinomycetemcomitans (49%). more juvenile periodontitis than healthy tissue samples showed supernatant fluid reactivity to p. intermedia, c. ochracea, e. nodatum and p. micros. no significant difference was observed between the juvenile periodontitis group supernatant fluids reactivity and the supernatant fluids of the other periodontal disease groups tested. cluster analysis revealed  the association, as determined by supernatant fluid reactivity, of p. micros and  c. ochracea in the juvenile periodontitis group. the data from this investigation are consistent with a hypothesis of multiple possible etiologies of periodontal destruction in juvenile periodontitis and other forms of periodontal diseases.

TI  == bacteriological diagnosis of periodontal disease.
AB  == dental plaque bacteria cause virtually all the forms of inflammatory periodontal  disease. periodontitis is caused by the specific periodontopathic bacteria, which induce destruction of connective tissue attachment and adjacent alveolar bone. examinations to identify the infections by porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens and treponema denticola have recently become essential in diagnosis of periodontal disease. bacterial examination permits (1) identification of the causative bacteria, (2) assessment of disease activity and (3) monitoring of the effective  of periodontal treatments. the author describes details of accurate and rapid methods for detecting periodontopathogens. transmission of periodontopathic bacteria as clarified by bacterial examination is also discussed in this review.  the pathogenic potential of specific bacteria varies among patients and periodontally healthy individuals and can be controlled by host defense mechanisms such as immune responses. the roles of immune responses against periodontopathic bacteria in balance shifts of periodontal disease processes are  therefore also discussed in this review.

AB  == the purposes of this study were two-fold: to compare the dna probe and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) microbial identification tests and correlate the levels of microorganisms with adult periodontitis. a single plaque sample were taken from each of 2 sites in 52 patients. twelve of these patients were also sampled during and after treatment. the experimental site had clinical indicators of disease (bleeding on probing, probing and attachment loss of > or = 6 mm) and the contralateral site (control) was clinically healthy. a total of 176 plaque samples were collected, divided, processed, and sent for both types of quantitative microbial analyses. all of these samples were used to compare the dna probe and elisa methods while only the initial 104 pretreatment sites were used to correlate microorganisms/method with clinical indicators of adult periodontitis. dna probes were used to assay for a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, t. denticola, and c. rectus. an elisa utilizing monoclonal antibodies was used to assay for p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, t. denticola, and c. rectus. comparison of the two methods revealed that the elisa test identified p. gingivalis and c. rectus significantly more often than the dna probe method and that t. denticola was detected more frequently with the dna probe. the sensitivities and specificities  varied widely among organisms and by test. p. gingivalis, as identified by elisa, had the highest degree of sensitivity and specificity (0.90 and 0.82 respectively) to clinical indicators of adult periodontitis.

AB  == eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. the composition of oral gram-negative anaerobic microflora was investigated in 21 young children (mean age 32 months) with primary dentition. the bacterial findings of samples were compared with those of the same children collected at their edentulous infant period (mean age 3 months). during the primary period, 2 samples were collected from each child: a sample with dental floss from gingival margin of 2 teeth and stimulated saliva pooled with a mucosal swab sample. both samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically using nonselective and selective media. prevotella  melaninogenica, nonpigmented prevotella spp., fusobacterium nucleatum group and capnocytophaga spp. were found in all children at the older age, whereas they occurred in edentulous mouth in 76%, 62%, 67% and 19%, respectively. the occurrence of prevotella loescheii increased from 14% to 90%, prevotella intermedia from 10% to 67%, leptotrichia spp. from 24 to 71%, campylobacter (wolinella) spp. from 5 to 43% and eikenella corrodens from 5 to 57%. only the occurrence of bacteroides gracilis and veillonella spp. remained at about the same level. species not isolated from the edentulous mouth, such as prevotella denticola, fusobacterium spp. other than the f. nucleatum group and selenomonas spp. were now detected in 71%, 71% and 43% of the children. the stability of the  colonizing p. melaninogenica strain(s) in the oral cavity was determined by using ribotyping; 1-2 isolates per child from the edentulous infant period of 9 children and 3-15 isolates per child from their primary dentition period were analyzed.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == modeling the relationship between clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic parameters and alveolar bone levels in an elderly population.
AB  == a cross-sectional periodontal study of 74 subjects aged 65 to 75 years was performed. clinical data were collected and related to microbiological and immunological data. a statistical model (step-wise multiple regression) of factors related to bone loss was created initially using clinical data only; then by adding either the microbiologic or immunologic data; and then by using clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic data together. when only clinical data were considered, three factors were found to have significant positive correlations with bone loss. tooth mobility accounted for 17% of the variability  in the alveolar bone level measurements, probing depth for 12%(r2), and plaque index for 3%, for a total of 32% of the variability explained by these clinical factors. tooth mobility and probing depth were clinical factors which remained significant in the model when the microbiological data were also considered. as percentages of the total cultivable microbiota, e. corrodens (r2 = 14%) and black-pigmenting prevotella intermedia (r2 = 4%) correlated positively with alveolar bone loss. the addition of the microbiologic data only increased the r2  to 33%. when immunological data were considered with the clinical data, pocket depth and tooth mobility were the clinical parameters which remained in the model. igg antibody levels to p. gingivalis w83 and/or 381 (r2 = 24%) a. actinomycetemcomitans 627 (r2 = 2%) were the significant immunologic measures having a positive correlation with bone loss. anti-f. nucleatum levels had a significant negative correlation. a total of 50% of the variability in alveolar bone level was accounted for in the model by the addition of specific serum antibody levels to subgingival plaque microorganisms. when clinical, microbiological, and immunological measurements were all considered together, antibody to p. gingivalis w83 and/or 381 (r2 = 42%), percentage of b-lymphocytes  (r2 = 3%), probing depth (r2 = 4%), anti-e. corrodens levels (r2 = 2%), and anti-p. gingivalis 33277 levels (r2 = 4%) all had significant positive correlation with loss of alveolar bone. the number of enteric bacteria, anti-f. nucleatum levels, and anti-p. intermedia levels each had a significant negative correlation with alveolar bone heights. the r2 for this model was 75%. these results indicated that antibody levels to subgingival plaque microorganisms and tooth mobility were the best predictors of bone loss in the elderly patients tested in this study.

TI  == detection of porphyromonas gingivalis in gingival exudate by a dipeptide-enhanced trypsin-like activity.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis in subgingival plaque is an important risk factor for future periodontal attachment loss in susceptible adults. the elimination of p. gingivalis is usually concomitant with a healing process. therefore, it should be valuable to have an easy chairside method to follow the effect of periodontal treatment on p. gingivalis detection as well as on its eventual reappearance during the maintenance period. we have previously reported the stimulation of amidolytic activity of p. gingivalis by the addition of glycyl-glycine to the assay buffer. in this study we determined the proportions of p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga spp, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens by cultivation technique and the amidolytic activity, using n-benzoyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanilide (bapna) as substrate, in gingival exudate before and during a 3-year treatment and maintenance period. p. gingivalis was the only species yielding a high and persistent correlation to stimulated amidolytic activity (p values < or = 0.0001) on both site (r = 0.5) and subject (r = 0.8) level. testing pure cultures of suggested periodontal pathogens for effect of glycyl-glycine on amidolytic activity, we found that of p. gingivalis to be 5.9-fold increased. the amidolytic activity of treponema denticola was only slightly stimulated (ratio with/without glycyl-glycine = 1.2) and that of capnocytophaga slightly inhibited (ratio with/without glycyl-glycine = 0.8). the  outcome of this study has the potential to be used for the development of a simple, rapid, and inexpensive assay for a qualitative and quantitative determination of p. gingivalis in gingival crevicular fluid.

AB  == prevention mouthrinse was designed to serve as a vital supplement to normal oral  hygiene procedures. to determine the antimicrobial potency of this mouthrinse, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics), bactericidal kinetics, and short-term exposure studies were conducted. a spectrum of oral microorganisms was employed in this investigation: streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, serratia  marcescens and candida albicans. microorganisms were cultured in standard enriched media and under appropriate atmospheric conditions. inhibition assays were conducted in tubes, with each mouthrinse dilution assayed in triplicate. mic determinations revealed that all of the microorganisms studied were highly susceptible to prevention mouthrinse, with mics ranging from 16-fold to 128-fold  dilutions. bactericidal kinetics assays showed rapid killing of the test organisms in the presence of the mouthrinse. brief (5-minute) exposure of s. mutans to 8-fold diluted mouthrinse resulted in a substantial delay in growth. under the constraints of this type of study, prevention mouthrinse exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against all of the microorganisms studied. we support the notion that prevention mouthrinse may be a valuable supplement to normal oral hygiene procedures. a 6-month clinical trial assessing the in vivo efficacy of prevention mouthrinse is currently being conducted.

TI  == an in vivo study of the influence of the surface roughness of implants on the microbiology of supra- and subgingival plaque.
AB  == in nine patients with fixed prostheses supported by endosseous titanium implants, 2 titanium abutments (transmucosal part of the implant) were replaced by either an unused standard abutment or a roughened titanium abutment. after 3 months of habitual oral hygiene, plaque samples were taken for differential phase-contrast  microscopy, dna probe analysis, and culturing. supragingivally, rough abutments harbored significantly fewer coccoid micro-organisms (64 vs. 81%), which is indicative of a more mature plaque. subgingivally, the observations depended on the sampling procedure. for plaque collected with paper points, only minor qualitative and quantitative differences between both substrata could be registered. however, when the microbiota adhering to the abutment were considered, rough surfaces harbored 25 times more bacteria, with a slightly lower density of coccoid organisms. the presence and density of periodontal pathogens subgingivally were, however, more related to the patient's dental status than to  the surface characteristics of the abutments. these results justify the search for optimal surface smoothness for all intra-oral and intra-sulcular hard surfaces for reduction of bacterial colonization and of periodontal pathogens.

AB  == mucogingival flaps were reflected over pairs of mandibular molar teeth with class ii furcation invasions. the dimensions of the furcations were measured. the teeth were debrided and an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (e-ptfe) membrane was placed and retained over one furcation of each pair (test site) for 4 weeks. the  second site served as a control. eight patients (group 1) with 12 e-ptfe sites received no antibiotic. seven patients (group 2) with 12 e-ptfe sites were administered amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium for 10 days. paper-points were used to collect bacterial samples and clinical indices were recorded at baseline  and weekly for 4 weeks. paper-point samples and the e-ptfe collected at week 4 were sonicated and analyzed by dna probes for seven putative pathogens. at baseline no parameter showed statistical differences between groups or sites. at  week 1 significantly greater levels of prevotella intermedia type i (p < 0.05) and fusobacterium nucleatum (p < 0.01) were found in group 1. at week 4, paper-point samples from test sites (p < 0.05) and e-ptfe materials (p < 0.001) showed significantly higher presence of bacteroides forsythus in group 1. no significant microbial changes were found for control sites over time or between groups. the total bacterial load at test sites over time increased similarly for  patients administered or not administered the antibiotic. clinical signs of inflammation were significantly greater in group 1 and associated with the presence of b. forsythus (p < 0.01).

TI  == oral and dental infections with anaerobic bacteria: clinical features, predominant pathogens, and treatment.
AB  == microbial populations colonizing the teeth are a major source of pathogens responsible for oral and dental infections, including periodontal diseases, gingivitis, pericoronitis, endodontitis, peri-implantitis, and postextraction infections. each entity has distinct clinical and microbial features. bacterial species associated with oral infections include actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium species, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, and peptostreptococcus micros. treponema pallidum-related spirochetes have been associated with acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis. porphyromonas endodontalis appears to be specifically related to endodontic infections. oral infections in medically compromised patients, including those with aids, are associated with similar species and are  usually complicated by superinfection with enteric and candida species. isolation of species causing oral infections requires the collection of appropriate samples and the use of strictly anaerobic techniques. rapid selective culture, immunofluorescence, and dna probe methods have been developed for the identification of these oral species. the varied measures required in the management of oral and dental infections may include antimicrobial therapy. accurate microbiological diagnosis, including antibiotic susceptibility testing,  is indicated for cases that do not respond to therapy.

TI  == enzyme activity in crevicular fluid in relation to metabolic control of diabetes  and other periodontal risk factors.
AB  == diabetics are generally considered at higher risk for periodontitis than non-diabetics. among diabetics, those with poorer metabolic control have often been found to have more periodontitis. this study investigated the relationship between two crevicular fluid enzymes, beta-glucuronidase (beta g) and lactic dehydrogenase (ldh), and metabolic control in 93 adults with type 1 or 2 diabetes. metabolic control was evaluated by glycosylated hemoglobin (hba1c) levels. the most visibly inflamed site was sampled for crevicular fluid enzymes and plaque for microbial assessment. plaque, calculus, and probing depth were also recorded. beta-glucuronidase was found at significantly higher levels in patients with poorer diabetic control while ldh levels were not related to control. using multiple regression analysis, good metabolic control was the only  predicting variable for beta-glucuronidase when considered with microbes, probing depth, plaque, calculus, age, duration, and type of diabetes. if beta-glucuronidase is a predictor of periodontal disease activity, diabetics with poor metabolic control are at higher risk for periodontitis.

TI  == aspartame as a source of essential phenylalanine for the growth of oral anaerobes.
AB  == phenylalanine and aspartic acid requirements were determined for 13 species of oral bacteria using the chemically defined medium omiz-w1. none of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, eikenella corrodens, selenomonas sputigena, treponema pectinovorum, t. socranskii, or wolinella recta required either of these amino acid constituents of aspartame (l-aspartyl-l-phenylalanine  methylester). phenylalanine was essential for the growth of capnocytophaga gingivalis, eubacterium timidum, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. vincentii, while aspartic acid was not required. with the exception of e. timidum, all phenylalanine-dependent strains could grow  when the free amino acid was replaced by aspartame at concentrations at least 10-fold lower than those used for aspartame as an artificial sweetener.

TI  == an analysis of the subgingival microflora in randomly selected subjects.
AB  == the aim of this study was to describe the presence of some microbial species in the subgingival microflora of a randomly selected subject sample. a further objective was to analyze the association between some microbiological characteristics and the periodontal conditions of the subjects. a total of 171 individuals aged 30-65 years were included. a pooled subgingival plaque sample was obtained from the mesial aspect of the 6 ramfjord teeth by the use of the paper-point method. the samples were processed and analyzed according to standardized procedures. the periodontal condition of the subjects was examined clinically and included assessment of plaque, gingivitis, probing pocket depth and probing attachment level. the results showed that 81% of the subjects were positive for campylobacter rectus, 80% for fusobacterium nucleatum, 77% for streptococcus sanguis, 72% for streptococcus mitis, 66% for eikenella corrodens,  58% for prevotella intermedia, 32% for capnocytophaga, 27% for selenomonas, 25% for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 14% for porphyromonas gingivalis and 13% for streptococcus mutans. small differences in the periodontal conditions were observed between subjects harboring p. gingivalis, a. actinomytecomitans or  > 5% p. intermedia and the rest of the sample. similarly small differences in the clinical parameters were revealed when the subjects were grouped according to proportions of disease-associated and health-associated species in their subgingival samples.

TI  == sub-gingival microflora in macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey.
AB  == the macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey is one of several non-human primate (nhp) models for periodontal disease. this report presents the bacteriology of the gingival sulci in m. mulatta monkeys. three sub-gingival sites (maxillary right central incisor, the disto-buccal of the mandibular left second molar and mesio-buccal of the mandibular right second molar) of 9 monkeys were evaluated clinically before scaling and 7 days after scaling. plaque samples were obtained  from sub-gingival sites before clinical examination and studied bacteriologically by dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and by primary phenotypic characterizations of culture isolates. several gingival sites presented with mild gingival inflammation. anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic  bacteria were the predominant flora colonizing the gingival sulci. the major microbial groups were haemophilus species (100% of sites; percentage of total anaerobic count (tac): 21-51), peptostreptococcus micros (89%, 7.5-29.5), actinomyces sp. (85%, 7-27), fusobacterium nucleatum (90%, 5-8), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (73%, 1.3-12), black-pigmented anaerobic rods (bpar) (80%,  0.6-6.5) and oral streptococci (80%, 0.2-1.0). microbial groups detected less often were wolinella sp. (66%, 0-2.6), capnocytophaga sp. (30%), eikenella corrodens (4.7%, 0), campylobacter sp. (28%, 0-0.1) and spirochetes (4.7%, 0-0.07). seven days after gingival sites were scaled, the plaque score and indices for gingival inflammation declined significantly. the gingival flora after scaling were characterized by lower proportions of the actinomyces sp., p.  micros and bpar; and increased proportions of the oral streptococci, relative to  pre-scaling levels.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == dna probe and enzyme analysis in periodontal diagnostics.
AB  == recent research in periodontology has indicated that a finite number of bacterial species are associated with periodontal disease. this has generated the hypothesis that periodontal disease is essentially an infection due to one or more of the putative periodontopathogens; i.e., the specific plaque hypothesis (sph). this microbial specificity paradigm has already changed the way researchers and some clinicians view periodontal disease. the clinician must heed several cautions signs, however, if he is to use the sph to provide treatment options that could enhance the delivery of care. there are several diagnostic technologies that can be used to detect and semi-quantitate those bacterial species that have been identified as periodontopathogens. this paper discusses diagnostic tests based upon the detection in plaque of dna segments or enzyme activity(ies) that are unique for one or more of the suspected periodontopathogens.

TI  == longitudinal monitoring of humoral antibody in subjects with destructive periodontal diseases.
AB  == fifty-one subjects (16-61 years old) with evidence of prior destructive periodontal disease were monitored clinically and immunologically at bi-monthly intervals for up to 5 yr. periodontal disease activity, determined as new attachment loss, was detected in 33 of these subjects. only 4 of 51 subjects failed to show an elevated serum antibody level to any of the 18 subgingival species tested. the antibody level threshold established for periodontally healthy subjects was exceeded most often in diseased subjects with serum antibody to actinobacillus sp., p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, c. concisus, f. nucleatum and p. intermedia in that order. in general, most serum antibody levels to subgingival species remained relatively consistent for periods as long as 5 yr. however, major increases and decreases in antibody could be detected to at most one or two species in individual subjects. in addition, prolonged, steady increases and decreases in antibody to specific species could be detected in certain subjects. these findings suggest that major changes occurring in serum antibody may reflect fluctuations in the nature of the infection. differences were observed in the antibody level to specific species when subjects were divided into subsets on the basis of clinical criteria. these included high levels of antibody to a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 in ljp and rpp subjects and to  a. actinomycetemcomitans 29523 in ljp and gjp subjects.

TI  == role of porphyromonas gingivalis 40-kda outer membrane protein in the aggregation of p. gingivalis vesicles and actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, an important pathogen in periodontitis, produces extracellular vesicles that aggregate with actinomyces viscosus cells. a 40-kda outer membrane protein (omp)-coding gene from p. gingivalis was cloned and the protein was found to be localized in these vesicles. the recombinant 40-kda omp did not show aggregation activity. however, affinity-purified antibody against the recombinant protein significantly inhibited aggregation of p. gingivalis vesicles with a. viscosus cells. the antibody also inhibited cellular coaggregation of several strains of p. gingivalis with a. viscosus cells, but not with other periodontal pathogens. moreover, aggregation of a. viscosus cells with p. gingivalis vesicles was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by pre-treatment  of the a. viscosus cells with the recombinant protein. these findings suggest that the 40-kda omp may be an important aggregation factor of p. gingivalis.

TI  == synergistic effect of pyrophosphate and sodium dodecyl sulfate on periodontal pathogens.
AB  == our previous studies have shown that pyrophosphate (ppi), the anticalculus component of tartar-control dentifrices, inhibits the growth of organisms associated with coronal and root surface caries. the purposes of this investigation were to: 1) determine if periodontal pathogens are similarly susceptible to the growth-inhibitory properties of ppi; and 2) determine if combinations of pyrophosphate-sodium dodecyl sulfate (ppi-sds) inhibit growth synergistically. porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, and campylobacter rectus (formerly  wolinella recta) were cultured in appropriate enriched media under anaerobic conditions. inhibition assays were performed in tubes containing media supplemented with ppi and/or sds. a range of concentrations of ppi and sds in 2-fold increments was employed, with each concentration assayed in triplicate. minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) analyses revealed all of the bacteria were susceptible to ppi and sds, with mics of 0.67% (25 mm) and 0.01% w/v respectively. combination studies with ppi-sds showed much greater growth inhibition against p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans than achieved with  the agents individually. determination of fractional inhibitory concentration indices indicated a synergistic growth-inhibitory effect. under the constraints of the conditions employed, these studies demonstrate the efficacy of ppi-sds combinations in inhibiting the growth of periodontal pathogens. it is conceivable that these compounds may have clinical benefit as a subgingival irrigant.

TI  == [polymorphonuclear leukocyte-mediated effects on human oral keratinocytes by periodontopathic bacterial extracts].
AB  == in order to investigate the polymorphonuclear leukocyte-mediated oral keratinocyte injury, the author established a method to culture keratinocytes (scc9 and gingival keratinocytes) and subjected to the cell detachment assay by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and/or bacterial ultrasonic extracts from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4, bacteroides forsythus omz 408, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953, capnocytophaga sputigena 4 and eikenella corrodens 1073. the bacterial extracts alone caused no cell disruption of the keratinocyte monolayers. polymorphonuclear leukocyte alone caused only a minimal  cell detachment. on the contrary, when the bacterial extracts were added to the co-culture of keratinocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, cell detachment of  keratinocytes was observed except for the bacterial extract from eikenella corrodens 1073. the effect of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 was the strongest. this effect was heat labile and not inhibited by polymyxin b. cell detachment was inhibited by alpha 1-antitrypsin but not by catalase and superoxide dismutase. no keratinocyte lysis was observed in terms of 51cr release. hydrogen peroxide and leukocyte elastase also caused keratinocyte detachment. these results indicate that polymorphonuclear leukocyte can cause non-lytic cell detachment of the gingival keratinocytes when encountering some bacteria, which may lead to the increase of the permeability of the keratinocyte  layers.

TI  == use of synthetic oligonucleotide dna probes for the identification of different strains of fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == the ability of three different oligonucleotide probes to identify different oral  strains of fusobacterium nucleatum was tested. probes 119 and 214 were designed on the basis of known amino acid sequences from the n-terminal end of an outer membrane protein of f. nucleatum strain fev1. probe h 2.1, was a randomly cloned  chromosomal dna fragment of 2.1 kbp. the specificities of the probes were examined by testing each of them against a panel of five other species of fusobacterium (six strains), oral and non-oral, and also against seven different  oral species of six other genera. the chromosomal dna of the bacteria to be examined was digested to completion using the restriction enzymes hincii, hindiii, ecori, ecorv and sau3ai. digests were run on agarose gels and subjected  to southern blotting before being hybridized with the probe in question. the results were confirmed by running a slot blot of genomic dna from all of the 19 strains and hybridizing with a probe h 2.1. probe h 2.1 turned out to be the most specific and useful of the three probes investigated. by use of this probe, interstrain identification of the six different strains of f. nucleatum could be  performed and the strains could be distinguished from other oral species found in the oral cavity, such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, haemophilus aphrophilus, capnocytophaga sputigena, porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis, eikenella corrodens and leptotrichia buccalis. the probe reacted weakly with other non-oral species of the genus fusobacterium, and there was no problem in distinguishing between the different strains.

TI  == tetracycline fiber therapy monitored by dna probe and cultural methods.
AB  == oligonucleotide dna probe and selective cultural methods were compared in their ability to monitor 6 putative periodontal pathogens in a study evaluating local tetracycline fiber therapy. subgingival plaque was sampled from 4 sites in each of 20 subjects. samples were taken before and after therapy from sites assigned to the following test groups: tetracycline (tc) fiber, scaling and root planing,  control fiber, and untreated. each sample was analyzed by both dna probe and cultural methods. total anaerobic cultivable counts, porphyromonas (bacteroides)  gingivalis and prevotella intermedia (bacteroides intermedius) were enumerated on nonselective blood agar. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum and wolinella recta were isolated on selective media. tc fiber therapy and scaling reduced total cultivable counts from an initial value of 1 x 10(7) to approximately 2 x 10(5) following therapy. total counts at untreated sites and at sites with control fibers did not change from baseline. a. actinomycetemcomitans and e. corrodens were detected more frequently by the cultural method; the other monitored species were detected more frequently by dna probes than by the cultural methods. agreements between methods were: 77.2% for a. actinomycetemcomitans; 72.2% for p. intermedia; 75.6% for e. corrodens; 39.4% for f. nucleatum; 35.6% for p. gingivalis; and 68.9% for w. recta. limitations of the selective cultural methods used probably contributed to the discrepancies for p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum. dna probe and cultural methods indicated comparable levels of suppression of the monitored species following tc fiber therapy and scaling. the microbiota of control fiber and untreated sites did not appear to be significantly altered by either method.

TI  == fluorescence immunoassay for detecting periodontal bacterial pathogens in plaque.
AB  == a particle concentration fluorescence immunoassay has been modified into a bacterial concentration fluorescence immunoassay (bcfia) to rapidly detect periodontopathic bacteria in human plaque samples. the bcfia utilizes fluorescently tagged monoclonal antibodies (mabs) directed against the lipopolysaccharide of selected gram-negative plaque bacteria. microorganisms closely associated with periodontal disease that can be identified in plaque with the bcfia include porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and eikenella corrodens. briefly, the procedure involved mixing a patient's plaque sample or other bacterial preparation with a species-specific fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled mab in a specialized microtiter plate. this mixture was incubated to allow binding of the mab to its homologous bacteria. the bound and unbound fluorescent tagged mabs were separated by filtration in the modified microtiter plate, and the total bacterial bound fluorescence was determined with  a fluorimeter. the number of a specific bacterial species in a given plaque sample or other bacterial suspension was estimated by reference to a primary standard carried through the bcfia. the lower detection limit of the bcfia was 10(3) to 10(4) bacterial cells from single cultures of bacteria or 10(4) bacterial cells in mixed cultures. the coefficient of variation within and between plates for each of the five bacterium-specific mabs in screening plaque for the periodontal pathogens was less than 10%. these results demonstrate that microbes in plaque can be used as the solid phase in the bcfia to detect and quantitate mabs associated with specific bacteria quickly and reliably.

TI  == dental bacterial plaques. nature and role in periodontal disease.
AB  == antony van leeuwenhoek first described oral bacteria. however, not until almost 200 years later was the famous koch postulate introduced. since then, research has extensively been performed regarding the development and microbiology of dental plaques. in spite of the complexity of the developing flora of supragingival plaque, culture studies have shown a remarkably orderly succession  of organisms. lately, the concept of microbial specificity in the etiology of periodontal diseases has been widely suggested, i.e., that different forms of periodontal disease are associated with qualitatively distinct dental plaques. cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of the predominant cultivable microflora reveal that only a small number of the over 300 species found in human subgingival plaques are associated with periodontal disease. among the commonly mentioned are: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, capnocytophaga sp., eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, and wolinella recta, as well as certain gram-positive bacteria such as eubacterium species. anti-infective therapy for many systemic infections equals the use of antimicrobial drugs. however, for localized infections like periodontal diseases, treatment may consist of a combination of mechanical wound  debridement and the application of an antimicrobial agent. the general effectiveness of mechanical anti-infective therapy and successful oral hygiene in the management of periodontal disease is well established in the literature and has met the test of success in clinical practice for most cases of periodontitis  in adults. the definition of periodontal pathogens as either opportunistic pathogens, or as exogenous pathogens carries with it significant implications.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == recent studies of microbial epidemiology emphasizing the genetic organization and distribution of organisms associated with orofacial infections have led to new insights into the possible origins of pathogenicity. studies into genetic heterogeneity, acquisition and transmission of these organisms have been markedly advanced by the utilization of the powerful technique of genomic dna fingerprinting. characteristic fingerprints for each bacterial isolate can be produced by cleavage of high molecular weight genomic dna by restriction endonucleases. it is assumed that each dna fingerprint represents a clonal type.  in this report, we review and analyze studies of the epidemiology of bacteria associated with orofacial infections with an emphasis on periodontal disease. studies of nontypable (nt) haemophilus influenzae associated with recurrent otitis media illustrate the utility of this technique. dna fingerprinting clearly demonstrates genetic heterogeneity of nt h. influenzae isolates, and clonality of infection of any individual. furthermore, dna fingerprinting has shown that the same clonal type is seen in siblings concurrently suffering from otitis media, suggesting horizontal transmission within the family. studies of mutans streptococci also show extensive genetic heterogeneity and show vertical transmission of a predominant clonal type only from mother to infant, but not from father to infant. studies of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans show considerable genetic heterogeneity among monkey isolates. thus far, three clonal  types have been reported with dna fingerprinting among isolates from periodontal  patients, but additional genetic heterogeneity can be found using specific dna fragments as probes in hybridization experiments. intrafamilial transmission of a. actinomycetemcomitans has been demonstrated. porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis shows extensive genetic heterogeneity and case reports suggest clonal  infection of any one individual. in contrast, results with dna fingerprinting of  eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, and bacteroides intermedius show that individuals may be infected with 2 or more clonal types. these studies point to the great potential of dna fingerprinting for investigating the epidemiology of putative orofacial pathogens. such studies with periodontal microorganisms will likely reveal steps in the acquisition, intraoral and person-to-person transmission, which then could possibly be inhibited or interfered with to prevent periodontal disease or its recurrence.

TI  == isolation and identification of bacteria from subgingival plaque with low susceptibility to minocycline.
AB  == twenty subgingival plaque samples from patients with chronic periodontitis were screened for the presence of three periodontal 'pathogens'--porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and eikenella corrodens. nineteen of the samples were found to contain at least one of the three organisms and six samples contained all three. the subgingival plaque samples were cultured in the presence of various concentrations of minocycline, and those organisms which appeared to be least susceptible to the antibiotic were isolated and identified. a total of 40 isolates were obtained and these consisted of 18 different species, only one of which, fusobacterium nucleatum, is generally recognized as being associated with chronic periodontitis. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of minocycline  for many of the organisms isolated were greater than the concentration of attainable in gingival crevicular fluid following routine parenteral administration of the antibiotic.

TI  == a heat stable hemagglutinating activity of eikenella corrodens.
AB  == strains of eikenella corrodens and fusobacterium nucleatum were shown to possess  lectinlike attachment factors. the present investigators found that e. corrodens  has a heat stable factor which agglutinates sheep, mouse, and human erythrocytes. the activity is not abolished by additions of galactose or lactose. lipopolysaccharide preparations from e. corrodens strains possessed strong hemagglutinating activity. lpss of f. nucleatum did not agglutinate any erythrocytes tested. sds-page patterns stained with silver stain revealed that the lpss of e. corrodens strains were rough type and those of f. nucleatum were wild type. the heat stable hemagglutinating activity of e. corrodens strains might be caused the rough type lps of the cells.

TI  == dna probe detection of eikenella corrodens, wolinella recta and fusobacterium nucleatum in subgingival plaque.
AB  == this cross-sectional study used species-specific dna probes to examine subgingival plaque specimens for the presence of eikenella corrodens, wolinella recta, and fusobacterium nucleatum in adults with untreated periodontitis or gingivitis and in healthy controls. w. recta and f. nucleatum were more prevalent in diseased sites from the periodontitis group when compared with the controls (81% vs 22% and 83% vs 20% respectively). e. corrodens was detected in 62% of the control sites and 81% of the periodontitis sites. because the control sites commonly contained this organism, e. corrodens may not be useful in differentiating between health and disease. in addition, the relationship between the prevalence of w. recta and f. nucleatum and the prevalence of the established periodontal pathogens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius and bacteroides gingivalis, was examined. positive detection of w. recta and f. nucleatum correlated closely with the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. intermedius and b. gingivalis. therefore, w. recta and  f. nucleatum do not appear to be unique indicators of periodontal disease.

AB  == twenty-seven patients with a recent history of periodontal abscesses and/or loss  of gingival attachment level (gal) despite active periodontal therapy were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. clinical measurements and subgingival scaling were performed every 2 months. when a site exhibited greater than or equal to 2 mm loss of gal or a periodontal abscess, patients were administered either doxycycline at a dosage of 200 mg to start and  100 mg per day for 3 weeks, or a placebo. clinical measurements of gal and microbial analysis of subgingival plaque at study and control sites were made at  the time of active disease and at intervals of 1 week and 7 months after completion of the drug regime. plaque samples were screened for the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), bacteroides intermedius (bi), eikenella corrodens (ec) and fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) by indirect immunofluorescence antibody technique and for spirochetes (sp) using ryu's stain. based on presence or absence analysis of the  sum scores of the 6 pathogens, both the placebo (n = 10) and the doxycycline groups (n = 17) exhibited similar scores at the time of detection of active disease (mean placebo = 2.38 +/- 0.32; mean doxycycline = 2.95 +/- 0.27; p = 0.18). one week after treatment, the probability of detection was unchanged in the placebo group (mean placebo = 3.14 +/- 0.47), but was significantly reduced in the doxycycline group (mean doxycycline = 1.77 +/- 0.26; p = 0.0002). study (active) sites exhibited scores 2 to 3 times higher than control (inactive) sites before doxycycline treatment.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == microbiological and immunological aspects of experimental periodontal disease in  rats: a review article.
AB  == animal models in which microbiological and immunological aspects of periodontal disease can be studied prospectively seem well warranted. the rat bears much resemblance to man with respect to periodontal anatomy, development and composition of dental plaque, histopathology of periodontal lesions, and basic immunobiology. furthermore, reproducible methods are available for assessment of  periodontal disease in rats, and detectable periodontal destruction can be induced in a few weeks in these animals without traumatizing periodontal tissues  with ligatures. experimental periodontitis studies in germ-free rats have confirmed the pathogenicity of several suspected periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, capnocytophaga sputigena, eikenella corrodens, and fusobacterium nucleatum). the studies also suggest that the number of periodontal pathogens may be higher than generally believed, since species like streptococcus sobrinus and actinomyces viscosus are  associated with periodontal bone loss in rats. studies in rats with congenital or induced immune defects indicate that generalized or selective immunosuppression at the time of infection with periodontal pathogens may aggravate periodontal disease. studies in immunized rats indicate that periodontal disease can be prevented by immunization against periodontal pathogens. however, it is also possible by immunization to induce periodontal destruction; i.e., the immune system has a destructive potential which should not be overlooked. in the future, the rat model may prove valuable for initial screening of antigen preparations and immunization regimens in the search for a periodontitis vaccine.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of flurbiprofen and ibuprofen in vitro against six common  periodontal pathogens.
AB  == nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids) such as flurbiprofen and ibuprofen,  have been shown to inhibit the inflammation and alveolar bone loss associated with chronic destructive periodontal disease. however, the direct effect of nsaids on the gingival crevice microflora has not been studied. the purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of ibuprofen and flurbiprofen in vitro on six commonly isolated periodontal pathogens. the bacterial strains evaluated were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum and wolinella recta. pure cultures of these organisms were inoculated into broth, allowed to grow and inoculated again into sheep blood agar plates. for preliminary dose-response studies, antibiotic sensitivity blank  disks loaded with 10 microliters of flurbiprofen 250 micrograms, 50 micrograms and 5 micrograms, or ibuprofen 500 micrograms, 50 micrograms and 5 micrograms were placed on the seeded agar plates. clindamycin 2 micrograms disks were used as positive controls and discs loaded with only drug vehicle served as negative controls. in an attempt to estimate the minimal inhibitory concentrations of these nsaids on specific microorganisms, additional experiments employing intermediate drug dosages were also performed. clindamycin produced large zones of inhibition for all bacterial strains except for eikenella corrodens which is known to be resistant to the antibiotic and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans  which appeared to be only moderately sensitive to the antibiotic. zones of inhibition were not produced by any of the negative control disks or by the 5 micrograms or 50 micrograms doses of either nsaid.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [subgingival microflora in children of early childhood, school age and circumpuberty. the proportion and frequency of gram-negative bacteria in periodontally healthy and gingivitis groups].
AB  == the present study characterized the microbial profiles of the gingival sulci in children. subgingival samples from 36 gingivitis lesions of 18 patients and 36 sites in 18 healthy persons were examined. the tested individuals were divided into three stages according to physiological maturation i.e. early childhood, school age, circumpuberty. puberty was confirmed through examination of wrist radiographs. using continuous anaerobic techniques, samples were dispersed, diluted and then inoculated on selective and nonselective media and cultured under the condition appropriate gaseous phase respectively. isolates were identified microbiologically and counted. all values were evaluated statistically. the samples were simultaneously examined by dark-field microscopy. changes in the proportions and the frequency of periodontophathic bacteria were distinct in different stages of physiological maturation. black-pigmented bacteroides species were commonly found in gingivitis lesions. bacteroides intermedius was frequently detected in the subgingival samples from children with gingivitis. in all stages, the proportion of black-pigmented bacteroides and b. intermedius in the gingivitis groups were found to be significantly higher than that of the healthy groups. statistical analysis revealed that levels of b. intermedius increased in circumpuberty stage compared with the 2 younger stages.  black-pigmented bacteroides and b. intermedius were closely related to gi, pli in 3 stages. bacteroides gingivalis was found only in two gingivitis sites of a circumpubertal child with gingivitis. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 4 out of 12 sites in the school age group, and in 6 out of 12 sites in the circumpuberty group with gingivitis respectively. in the circumpuberty group, the proportion of a. actinomycetemcomitans in the gingivitis group was significantly higher than that of the healthy group, and a. actinomycetemcomitans was closely related to gi, pli, ci, ppd. eikenella corrodens was found to be associated with gingivitis in the school age and circumpuberty groups. no correlation was found in the detection of fusobacterium nucleatum in 3 stages. microscopic examination showed that the proportion of rods, fusiforms, filaments, motile rods, spirochetes in the gingivitis groups was significantly higher than that of the healthy groups, while the proportion of cocci in gingivitis groups was significantly lower than that of the healthy groups in 3 stages. spirochetes  were closely related to gi, pli, ppd in all stages.

AB  == different bacterial profiles of subgingival plaque have been described for different clinical categories of marginal periodontitis. in the present investigation the subgingival microflora was studied in young adults with advanced marginal periodontitis. from 12 patients pooled subgingival plaque samples from 5 advanced stages of diseased sites were examined by direct differential phase-contrast microscopy and by cultivation on enriched and selective media. the proportions of the following genera and species were calculated: black-pigmented bacteroides sp., b. gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, veillonella sp., actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga  sp., eikenella corrodens, campylobacter sp., and candida sp. spirochete identification was carried out ultrastructurally. calculated percent minimum similarity levels between the individuals revealed that each patient harbored its characteristic cultivable subgingival microflora different from the other individuals. the spirochetes seemed to constitute the subgingival bacterial group with the smallest variation as certain morphotypes were dominating in almost all  individuals.

TI  == susceptibility of oral bacteria to phenoxyethanol and phenoxyethanol/chlorhexidine combinations.
AB  == a total of 57 bacterial strains (26 different species) which may be isolated from subgingival plaque were tested for their in vitro susceptibility to phenoxycthanol, a commonly-used antiseptic and preservative. ninety-five percent  of the strains, including those associated with chronic inflammatory periodontal  disease, were susceptible to concentrations of phenoxyethanol used topically (2%  w/v). phenoxyethanol at a concentration of 1% (w/v) was also found that to have a rapid bactericidal effect achieving a 99.9% kill in 5 minutes or less for species such as bacterodides gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, and wolinella recta. addition of chlorhexidine to phenoxyethanol resulted in a mixture with increased antibacterial activity. for most bacterial strains, the presence of chlorhexidine resulted in at least a four-fold decrease in the concentration of pheoxyethanol required for inhibition of growth. these results imply that phenoxyethanol may be useful in the treatment of chronic inflammatory  periodontal disease either by itself or in combination with chlorhexidine.

TI  == the relationship of serum igg antibody titers to periodontal pathogens to indicators of the host response in crevicular fluid.
AB  == in this study; the relationship of indicators of the local host response in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) to the serum antibody titer to periodontal pathogens was examined. 15 patients with chronic adult periodontitis were studied. gcf was collected and analyzed for the total amount of igg, igm, the lysosomal enzyme b-glucuronidase (bg) and alpha-2-macroglobulin (alpha 2m). at the same examination, serum from these patients was collected, and enzyme-linked  immunosorbent assays used to determine the serum igg antibody titer to a panel of 17 periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (3 strains), bacteroides gingivalis (4), eikenella corrodens (2), wolinella recta, bacteroides intermedius (3), fusobacterium nucleatum, and 3 capnocytophaga species). using spearman rank order correlation analysis, correlation coefficients were calculated to relate the 4 indicators of host response in gcf to the serum igg antibody titer to each of the 17 micro-organisms. the mean correlation between total igg in gcf and the serum igg antibody titer was positive (r = +0.30), and statistically significant correlations between total igg in gcf and serum igg antibody titer were observed for one strain of b. intermedius and c. ochracea. a  weaker positive correlation was observed for igm (r = 0.18). in contrast, the mean correlation between total bg in gcf and the serum antibody titer was negative (r = -0.34). statistically significant negative correlations were observed for all 3 strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans, one strain of e. corrodens and w. recta. the mean correlation for alpha 2m was r = -0.06. these data suggest that elevated bg activity in gcf, believed to be a marker for lysosomal enzyme released from polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the crevicular environment, may be associated with a reduced serum igg antibody response to suspected periodontal pathogens. furthermore, these findings imply that the development of a serum igg antibody response to suspected periodontal pathogens is consistent with a protective host response.

TI  == role of cryptic receptors (cryptitopes) in bacterial adhesion to oral surfaces.
AB  == progress in characterizing the receptors that promote bacterial attachment to teeth and oral epithelial cells has suggested that hidden molecular segments may  frequently be involved. such cryptic receptors, referred to as 'cryptitopes', may become exposed by several mechanisms. hidden segments of salivary acidic proline-rich proteins evidently become exposed when the molecules undergo a conformational change as they adsorb to apatitic mineral. adhesins of actinomyces viscosus and certain other prominent dental plaque bacteria are able to bind to these cryptitopes, and this enables these organisms to bind to proline-rich proteins on apatitic surfaces while avoiding interactions with these proteins in  solution. cryptitopes may also become exposed as a result of enzymatic action. thus, several bacteria, including fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii and bacteroides intermedius, have adhesins that bind to galactosyl receptors which become exposed after treatment with neuraminidase.  similarly, the adhesion of some gram-negative bacteria, such as bact. gingivalis, is enhanced when tissue surfaces are treated with certain proteases, or lysosomal enzymes derived from human polymorphonuclear leucocytes. it seems likely that elevated levels of enzymes present in gingival fluid as sequelae of poor oral hygiene and gingivitis may generate cryptitopes for potentially periodontopathic  bacteria, and thereby contribute to modulation of the gingival flora.

TI  == [microbiological and serological investigation of periodontal disease activity].
AB  == if disease activity in periodontal disease can be determined, the therapeutic measures of periodontitis may become diverse and different from patient to patient. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the usefulness of microbiological and serological examination of periodontopathic bacteria in detecting destructive periodontal disease activity. one hundred and forty-eight sites in 52 subjects with moderate to severe periodontitis were studied clinically. clinical parameters included plaque index, gingival index, probing depth, bleeding on probing and percent bone loss as measured radiographically. subgingival plaque of whole sites was investigated microbiologically by means of  indirect fluorescent-antibody technique with rabbit antibodies against actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (2 serotypes), eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides gingivalis and bacteroides intermedius. the levels of serum igg antibody to these organisms were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with whole cell preparations. thirty-two of 52 subjects were instructed in oral hygiene and received several sessions of scaling and root planing. the clinical, bacteriological and serological assessments were also performed after periodontal therapy. active disease site was defined as the site of which clinical status did not be improved even after periodontal treatment. b. gingivalis, b. intermedius and a. viscosus were detected in 80% of periodontal lesions, and the proportion of b. gingivalis  was the highest among six bacterial species tested. a. actinomycetemcomitans, e.  corrodens and f. nucleatum were found only occasionally and in low numbers. the proportion of b. gingivalis was higher in severely inflamed sites than in clinically healthy sites. b. gingivalis and b. intermedius are rarely found in treated periodontitis sites, while the proportion of a. viscosus was slightly increased after treatment. sera of the pre-treatment patients demonstrated significantly higher antibody levels to b. gingivalis and significantly lower levels to a. viscosus than those of healthy persons. antibody levels reactive with other four species in the patients did not significantly differ from the levels in healthy persons. after periodontal therapy, antibody levels to b. gingivalis, b. intermedius and a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotype a) significantly decreased and the levels to a. viscosus increased to a slight degree. b. gingivalis was found more frequently in disease-active sites than in disease-inactive sites. the proportions of other bacterial species in disease-active sites did not differ from those in disease-inactive sites. the results of the present investigation suggest that monitoring b. gingivalis in subgingival plaque and serum igg antibody titer against this organism may aid in  the description and adequate treatment of the periodontal disease.

AB  == lipopolysaccharide (lps) preparations from the bacteroides species b. endodontalis, b. intermedius, b. denticola, and b. melaninogenicus and from fusobacterium nucleatum, haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga gingivalis, and eikenella corrodens directly agglutinated erythrocytes of some kinds of animals. lpss from the bacteroides species b. gingivalis, b. asaccharolyticus, b. corporis, and b. loescheii and from capnocytophaga ochracea  did not possess any hemagglutinating activity. pretreatment of lpss with lipase and phospholipase c completely eliminated the hemagglutinating activity. the hemagglutinating activity was also affected by human serum, saliva, colistin, and polymyxin b but was not affected by sugars, amino acids, edta, or proteolytic enzymes. the role of this hemagglutinating activity in colonization by these microorganisms of the periodontal region is discussed.

TI  == suspected periodontopathic microorganisms and their oral habitats in young children.
AB  == samples of subgingival plaque from 67 children, 5-7 years of age, were examined for the presence of certain suspected periodontal pathogenic species using the conventional technique of anaerobic sonification, dilution and spiral plating. when this technique was compared with a direct plating procedure which involved no preliminary dispersion and dilution of plaque specimens, it was found that the direct method resulted in double the frequency of children in whom black-pigmented bacteroides (bpb) were detected and a 10-times increase in the number of subjects harbouring actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. samples from  the tongue, tonsils and saliva were also plated using the direct technique. bpb were detected less commonly in the plaque specimens (61.3% of children) than in saliva (89.5%), or on the tongue (86.6%) and tonsils (97.1%). expressed as percentages of a pooled sample of the total bpb population, the most frequently detected species in plaque were bacteroides intermedius (44.4%) and bacteroides melaninogenicus (48.0%). the most prevalent isolate in all other oral sites was b. melaninogenicus. expressed as percentages of children in whom bpb were detected, the most frequently isolated species from plaque using the conventional dilution technique was b. intermedius (21.3%), whereas other bpb species were present in fewer than 5% of children. fusobacterium nucleatum and capnocytophaga  species were isolated most frequently from plaque but were also commonly detected in the various other oral sites.

TI  == certain bacterial species and morphotypes in localized juvenile periodontitis and in matched controls.
AB  == subgingival microflora in localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp) was examined by  culture of certain bacterial species and by direct dark-field microscopy in affected and unaffected periodontal pockets of 11 patients and in their age- and  sex-matched controls. only actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.) correlated to periodontal destruction and occurred most frequently at the affected ljp sites. a.a., bacteroides intermedius and fusobacterium nucleatum were isolated in proportions greater than 5% of the flora at the affected ljp sites, but various actinomyces spp. at the unaffected and control sites. the proportions of straight rods, fusiforms and small spirochetes correlated to gingival bleeding tendency and were higher at the affected ljp sites than at the control sites. certain nonpigmented bacteroides spp. and eikenella corrodens were never isolated when only cocci were seen at dark-field microscopy. the more complex the flora, the more frequently b. intermedius occurred. the results support a significant role for a.a. in ljp and indicate that certain bacterial species appear to prefer occurring in the complex composition of subgingival microflora.

TI  == humoral antibody response against bacteroides gingivalis-specific antigen recognized by monoclonal antibody in adult periodontal patients.
AB  == an antigen recognized by monoclonal antibody specific for bacteroides gingivalis  was purified in the presence of 0.5% (wt/vol) beta-octyl-glucoside by immunoadsorbent column chromatography. the purified antigen was homogeneous as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) and silver staining, and the pattern of sds-page agreed with that of immunoblotting. the molecule exhibited an apparent molecular weight of about 62,000 by sds-page. the antigen was sensitive to trypsin, staphylococcus aureus v8 protease, dnase i and ii, and heating, but insensitive to rnase and neuraminidase. by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method, the purified antigen was not cross-reactive with rat polyclonal antibodies to each of several  black-pigmented bacteroides species, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. these results indicate that  the purified antigen is specific for b. gingivalis. humoral antibody titers in adult periodontal patients against the specific antigen were measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. serum immunoglobulin g antibody titers against the specific antigen in adult periodontal patients correlated significantly with  the severity of periodontal disease. however, such significant correlation was not observed with serum immunoglobulin m antibody titers.

TI  == frequency distributions of periodontal attachment loss. clinical and microbiological features.
AB  == the present investigation attempted to determine if the pattern of past periodontal destruction could be concisely summarized, and related to other clinical and microbiological parameters. 61 subjects between the ages of 12 and 61 years with destructive periodontal disease were evaluated at 6 sites per tooth for redness, plaque, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth, and attachment level. the frequency distribution of baseline attachment level measurements was computed for each individual. a curve fitting algorithm was used to fit the frequency distribution to 1-, 2-, and 3-term normal distributions. the parameters of the fit could be used to summarize concisely all of the frequency distributions. 3 major patterns of attachment loss could be distinguished. pattern i required a two-term distribution with localized destruction at less than 34% of sites and was further divided into 3 groups, depending on average attachment loss at diseased sites. the means of the second peak for the subgroups were 2.7, 5.3, and 8.6 mm, respectively. pattern ii exhibited more widespread disease (greater than 33% of sites affected) with multiple peaks in the frequency distribution requiring a 3-term distribution for satisfactory fit. however, a significant proportion of sites was not affected. pattern iii exhibited a single-peaked normal distribution in which virtually all sites were affected. mean attachment levels of the peaks in this group ranged from 2.7 to 8.4 mm. 23 of the 61 subjects showed significant attachment loss at 1 or more sites during the course of bi-monthly monitoring, as determined by the tolerance method of analysis. subgingival plaque samples were taken from these active sites and matched with control sites prior to therapy. the proportions of fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus intermedius, and eikenella corrodens were significantly  elevated in active and control sites of subjects in groups ii and iii combined (the widespread disease groups), and proportions of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and propionibacterium acnes were elevated in active and control sites of the more localized disease group i subjects. group i subjects showed a 13- to 15-fold decrease in hazard rates of periodontal sites after widman flap surgery and systemic tetracycline, whereas groups ii and iii subjects showed 2-to 6-fold decreases.

TI  == attachment level changes in destructive periodontal diseases.
AB  == the present communication attempts to summarize some of the features of attachment loss which are of interest to the clinician and the statistician analyzing data from clinical trials. these include the measurements employed to detect changes in attachment level, the nature of the destructive disease process and the effects of therapy on the attachment level measurements. although there are several difficulties associated with the attachment level measurement, at the present time it appears to be the best estimator of periodontal attachment available. the overall standard deviation of this measurement in greater than 46,000 replicate measurements at periodontal sites in 58 subjects was 0.78 mm (range 0.4 to 1.2 mm). in the periodontally healthy subject, the length of the attachment measured around 28 teeth is approximately 700 mm. therefore, there are approximately 1400 adjacent points along the periodontal attachment where a measurement could be made using a periodontal probe with a 0.5 mm diameter tip. if 6 measurements were recorded per tooth, then approximately 12% of the possible probable points would be evaluated. recent data indicate that destructive periodontal diseases progress with acute bursts of activity rather than as slowly progressive, continual processes. such findings suggest new models of attachment  loss progression. in one likely model, destructive periodontal diseases would progress by asynchronous bursts of activity at individual sites which occur with  greater frequency during a finite period of time in an individual's life. 3 major patterns of attachment loss could be distinguished when frequency distributions of attachment level measurements were constructed for 61 destructive periodontal  disease subjects. pattern i (30 subjects) exhibited a bimodal distribution with localized destruction occurring at less than 34% of sites. pattern ii (14 subjects) exhibited more widespread disease (greater than 33% of sites affected)  with a trimodal frequency distribution. pattern iii (17 subjects) exhibited a unimodal distribution in which virtually all sites were affected. the proportions of fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus intermedius and eikenella corrodens in  subgingival plaque samples were significantly elevated in sites of subjects with  patterns ii and iii (the widespread disease groups). bacteroides intermedius, streptococcus uberis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were elevated in sampled sites of localized disease subjects (pattern i). the effects of therapy by widman flap surgery and systemic tetracycline were examined by several statistical analyses.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == assessment of serum antibody patterns and analysis of subgingival microflora of members of a family with a high prevalence of early-onset periodontitis.
AB  == in a study of members of a large family with a high prevalence of early-onset periodontitis, we sampled the subgingival microflora and characterized 40 isolates from each sample. we surveyed serum samples by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies reacting with any of a panel of 21 periodontal bacteria. the mother and 7 of her 13 children had early-onset periodontitis. bacteroides gingivalis was not detected in the subgingival flora of any affected  or unaffected family member, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was isolated from only one affected child. capnocytophaga ochracea was isolated from  five of seven affected children and from none of their normal siblings. we found  no significant differences among the floras from family members who had rapidly progressive, juvenile, and prepubertal forms of periodontitis. elevated levels of serum antibody reacting with one or more of the bacteria tested were found in all family members with disease, but in only one periodontally normal family member.  both children with prepubertal periodontitis had antibodies reacting with c. sputigena, a species not found in their subgingival floras, but with none of the  other bacteria tested. all remaining affected family members had antibodies to one or more serotypes of a. actinomycetemcomitans, and four had antibodies reacting with additional bacteria, including c. sputigena, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, and haemophilus aphrophilus. sera from patients contained antibodies specific for putative periodontal pathogens not found in their pocket flora, and conversely, putative periodontal pathogens for which no serum antibodies were found frequently comprised a large proportion (10% or more) of the pocket flora. in no case were both the bacterium and its antibody found. these observations are suggestive of sequential infection in the early-onset forms of periodontitis and of induction of protective immunity against reinfection by the same microorganism.

TI  == gram negative species associated with active destructive periodontal lesions.
AB  == apical subgingival plaque samples were taken from 19 subjects exhibiting active destructive periodontal disease. the predominant cultivable gram negative species from 50 active sites were compared to 69 inactive sites of comparable pocket depth and attachment level loss. active disease sites were chosen which showed a  significant loss of attachment within a two-month interval. proportions of gram negative rods were higher in active periodontal disease sites than in inactive sites. species which were found to be significantly elevated only in active sites were bacteroides intermedius, "fusiform" bacteroides, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and wolinella recta. fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga gingivalis and eikenella corrodens were found in significantly increased proportions in active sites of some subjects and inactive sites of others.

TI  == survival analysis of periodontal sites before and after periodontal therapy.
AB  == periodontal diseases appear to progress with bursts of destructive activity at individual sites. one effect of treatment might be to diminish the frequency of such bursts. survival analysis was employed to seek such effects on the periodontal sites of 16 individuals with prior evidence of destructive periodontal disease. the subjects were monitored at bi-monthly intervals and actively breaking down sites were detected using attachment level measurements and the tolerance method of analysis. when active sites were detected, control sites of equal pocket depth and attachment loss were selected and microbiological and immunological samples were taken. the subjects were treated by modified widman flap surgery and systemically administered tetracycline. on completion of  therapy, bi-monthly monitoring was reinstituted. life tables were constructed for periodontal sites in each of the 16 subjects prior to and after therapy. a site losing more than 3 mm of attachment at any time interval was considered to have relapsed or "died". survivor functions were calculated for each time period indicating the % of sites which survived at any time. the subjects were divided into 3 categories on the basis of post-therapy survivor functions. the annual hazard rate in 9 good treatment response subjects (group 1) was reduced from 0.10/year to 0.01/year. the hazard rate of 5 intermediate treatment response subjects (group 2a) was reduced from 0.16/year to 0.04/year and that of 2 poor treatment response subjects (group 2b) from 0.15/year to 0.07/year. group 2a and  2b individuals were combined and differences were sought in clinical, microbiological and immunological parameters between the good and poor treatment  response groups. 5 out of 7 of the poor responding individuals showed elevated humoral antibody responses to 3 or more gram-negative subgingival species tested. many of the elevated responses in this group were to organisms which are widely distributed and return quickly after therapy such as fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, bacteroides intermedius and capnocytophaga sputigena. the predominant cultivable microbiota in subgingival samples taken prior to therapy from the good responding group had significantly greater proportions of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, c. ochracea and b. intermedius than the poor responding group. the latter group showed significantly elevated proportions of f. nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros and streptococcus intermedius.

TI  == fatty acid composition and shwartzman activity of lipopolysaccharides from oral bacteria.
AB  == the composition and the nature of the linkage of fatty acids and the shwartzman activity of lipopolysaccharide (lps) preparations derived from oral gram-negative bacteria including bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides loesheii, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were examined. 3-hydroxylated and nonhydroxy fatty acids of various chain lengths were found in all of the lps preparations. all nonhydroxy fatty acids were found to be ester-bound, and part of the 3-hydroxy fatty acids in the lps of b. gingivalis, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were shown to be involved in ester linkage. it was also suggested that the hydroxy group of the ester-bound 3-hydroxy fatty acid of the lps of f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans is at least partly substituted by another fatty acid, but in the lps of b. gingivalis and e. corrodens it is not. the main amide-linked fatty acid of the lps of b. gingivalis, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, and a. actinomycetemcomitans was 3-hydroxyheptadecanoic, 3-hydroxydodecanoic, 3-hydroxyhexadecanoic, and 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid, respectively. the results of the shwartzman assay showed that the e. corrodens lps was the most active among the preparations tested, and that the shwartzman toxicity of bacteroides lps is extremely low.

TI  == clinical, microbiological and immunological features associated with the treatment of active periodontosis lesions.
AB  == clinical, microbiological and immunological factors were examined using data from a subject with periodontosis. the subject was monitored at bimonthly intervals for 26 months at 6 sites per tooth for redness, plaque, suppuration, bleeding on  probing, pocket depth, and attachment level. using attachment level measurements  and the tolerance method of analysis, sites with active disease and control (inactive) sites of equal pocket depth were selected. subgingival plaque samples  were taken from these sites for predominant cultivable and dark field evaluation  before, and 5 and 13 months after treatment by widman flap surgery and systemic tetracycline. 50 isolates from each of 5 sites monitored before and after treatment were characterized and, if possible, identified. active sites showed between 2 and 6 mm of attachment loss prior to therapy and "gained" between 2 and 9 mm of attachment after therapy. the control sites "gained" 0 to 1 mm of attachment after therapy. bleeding on probing was significantly reduced after treatment, whereas plaque accumulation increased significantly in the sampled sites. similar changes were seen in the remaining sites. the proportions of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and selenomonas sputigena were elevated in active sites, while proportions of bacteroides intermedius were elevated in control sites. 5 months after treatment, proportions of a. actinomycetemcomitans, s. sputigena and eikenella corrodens were significantly decreased in the previously active sites and proportions of b. intermedius and e. corrodens were significantly decreased in the control sites. 13 months after therapy, the proportions of fusobacterium nucleatum and capnocytophaga species had increased.  multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine models which could "predict" the outcome, attachment level change in the previous monitoring period. the proportions of a. actinomycetemcomitans and s. sputigena, which were associated with destruction, coupled with the proportions of streptococcus sanguis ii and campylobacter concisus which were associated with "gain" could predict prior attachment level change with an r2 of 0.93. humoral antibody response to a. actinomycetemcomitans and c. sputigena significantly increased in  a period in which multiple actively breaking down sites were detected. antibody responses to 20 other species tested did not significantly change during the course of monitoring. crevicular fluid and tissue levels of antibody to a. actinomycetemcomitans were elevated in 5 of 6 active destructive lesions prior to therapy.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == immunoglobulin g response to subgingival gram-negative bacteria in human subjects.
AB  == serum and gingival crevicular fluid from normal healthy adults and patients with  periodontitis were screened for immunoglobulin g antibodies to antigens from bacteroides gingivalis 381, bacteroides intermedius 24, bacteroides loescheii atcc 15930, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586, eikenella corrodens 1073, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans atcc 29522, and capnocytophaga sp. strain m-12. immunoglobulin g antibody titers to the antigens were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the antibody levels to b. gingivalis in serum  and gingival crevicular fluid were significantly higher in the samples from patients with periodontitis than in samples from healthy individuals. although there were individual differences within patient groups, a positive correlation (p less than 0.01) was found between the serum immunoglobulin g levels to b. gingivalis and the development of periodontitis. the antibodies to f. nucleatum (p less than 0.05), e. corrodens (p less than 0.05), and a. actinomycetemcomitans were slightly higher in patients with periodontitis than in normal subjects. there were no remarkable differences between the two groups in titers to b. intermedius, b. loescheii, and capnocytophaga sp.

TI  == medium for selective isolation of fusobacterium nucleatum from human periodontal  pockets.
AB  == a selective medium, cve agar, was developed for the isolation of fusobacterium nucleatum from subgingival plaque of periodontally diseased patients. the medium  contained 1.0% trypticase (bbl microbiology systems), 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% nacl, 0.2% glucose, 0.02% l-tryptophan, 1.5% agar, and 5% defibrinated whole sheep blood. erythromycin and crystal violet were added as the selective inhibitory agents at concentrations of 4 and 5 micrograms/ml, respectively. the medium permitted almost total recovery of f. nucleatum when compared with a nonselective medium and suppressed the recovery of most remaining species by nonselective medium and suppressed the recovery of most remaining species by 6 to 8 orders of magnitude. microorganisms suppressed to a lesser degree included selenomonas sputigena, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, and some strains of peptostreptococcus. the distinct colonial morphology of f. nucleatum on cve agar made differentiation relatively easy when contaminants were present. with this medium, f. nucleatum was enumerated from 278 subgingival plaque samples and accounted for less than 1.0 to greater than 25% of the cultivatable microbiota.

TI  == a study of the bacteria associated with advancing periodontitis in man.
AB  == samples of apical plaque were taken by means of an anaerobic gas-flushed syringe  from 21 sites in eight patients. the samples were anaerobically dispersed, diluted and plated and incubated in an atmosphere of 80% n2, 10% h2 and 10% co2 for 7-21 days. all colonies on plates containing 20-50 isolates were picked, repeatedly restreaked, characterized and identified where possible by a probabilistic computer identification program. the sites were divided into four groups on the basis of clinical features. the significance of differences between bacterial populations in the groups was determined by the kruskal wallis and mann-whitney u tests, while the spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to determine the rank correlation of clinical features of diseases and microbial species. the subgingival microbiota in advanced destructive sites was predominated by gram-negative rods. the microbiota of two young adult patients with generalized extensive bone loss, extensive clinical inflammation and suppuration was dominated by bacteroides asaccharolyticus and an organism with characteristics consistent with actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the predominant cultivable microbiota in two patients with extensive bone loss but minimal clinical inflammation was predominated by bacteroides melaninogenicus ss  intermedius and eikenella corrodens in one patient and e. corrodens and a slow growing fusiform-shaped bacteroides in a second patient. a third group of four patients demonstrated moderate levels of clinical inflammation and evidence of continued bone loss in the last year. predominant organisms in this group were more heterogeneous and included b. asaccharolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum, the "fusiform" bacteroides and anaerobic vibrios. sites with minimal disease in the patients revealed higher proportions of gram-positive organisms including rothia  dentocariosa, actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces viscosus. a positive rank correlation could be detected between clinical inflammation including suppuration and b. asaccharolyticus and a negative rank correlation between inflammation and  e. corrodens.
