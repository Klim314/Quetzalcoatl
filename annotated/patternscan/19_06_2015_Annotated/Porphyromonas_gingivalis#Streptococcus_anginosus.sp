TI  == microbial dynamics during conversion from supragingival to subgingival biofilms in an in vitro model.
AB  == the development of dental caries and periodontal diseases result from distinct shifts in the microbiota of the tooth-associated biofilm. this in vitro study aimed to investigate changes in biofilm composition and structure, during the shift from a "supragingival" aerobic to a "subgingival" anaerobic profile. biofilms consisting of actinomyces oris, candida albicans, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar were aerobically grown in saliva-containing medium on hydroxyapatite discs. after 64 h, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus anginosus were further added along with human serum, while culture conditions were shifted to microaerophilic. after 96 h, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were finally added and the biofilm was grown anaerobically for another 64 h. at the end of each phase, biofilms were harvested for species-specific quantification and localization. apart from c. albicans, all other species gradually increased during aerobic and microaerophilic conditions,  but remained steady during anaerobic conditions. biofilm thickness was doubled during the microaerophilic phase, but remained steady throughout the anaerobic phase. extracellular polysaccharide presence was gradually reduced throughout the growth period. biofilm viability was reduced during the microaerophilic conversion, but was recovered during the anaerobic phase. this in vitro study has characterized the dynamic structural shifts occurring in an oral biofilm model during the switch from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, potentially modeling the  conversion of supragingival to subgingival biofilms. within the limitations of this experimental model, the findings may provide novel insights into the ecology of oral biofilms. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == quantitative proteomics reveal distinct protein regulations caused by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans within subgingival biofilms.
AB  == periodontitis is an infectious disease that causes the inflammatory destruction of the tooth-supporting (periodontal) tissues, caused by polymicrobial biofilm communities growing on the tooth surface. aggressive periodontitis is strongly associated with the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in the subgingival biofilms. nevertheless, whether and how a. actinomycetemcomitans orchestrates molecular changes within the biofilm is unclear. the aim of this work was to decipher the interactions between a. actinomycetemcomitans and other  bacterial species in a multi-species biofilm using proteomic analysis. an in vitro 10-species "subgingival" biofilm model, or its derivative that included additionally a. actinomycetemcomitans, were anaerobically cultivated on hydroxyapatite discs for 64 h. when present, a. actinomycetemcomitans formed dense intra-species clumps within the biofilm mass, and did not affect the numbers of the other species in the biofilm. liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify the proteomic content of the biofilm lysate. a  total of 3225 and 3352 proteins were identified in the biofilm, in presence or absence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, respectively. label-free quantitative proteomics revealed that 483 out of the 728 quantified bacterial proteins (excluding those of a. actinomycetemcomitans) were accordingly regulated. interestingly, all quantified proteins from prevotella intermedia were up-regulated, and most quantified proteins from campylobacter rectus, streptococcus anginosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis were down-regulated in presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans. enrichment of gene ontology pathway analysis showed that the regulated groups of proteins were responsible primarily  for changes in the metabolic rate, the ferric iron-binding, and the 5s rna binding capacities, on the universal biofilm level. while the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans did not affect the numeric composition or absolute protein  numbers of the other biofilm species, it caused qualitative changes in their overall protein expression profile. these molecular shifts within the biofilm warrant further investigation on their potential impact on its virulence properties, and association with periodontal pathogenesis.

TI  == establishment of an oral infection model resembling the periodontal pocket in a perfusion bioreactor system.
AB  == periodontal infection involves a complex interplay between oral biofilms, gingival tissues and cells of the immune system in a dynamic microenvironment. a  humanized in vitro model that reduces the need for experimental animal models, while recapitulating key biological events in a periodontal pocket, would constitute a technical advancement in the study of periodontal disease. the aim of this study was to use a dynamic perfusion bioreactor in order to develop a gingival epithelial-fibroblast-monocyte organotypic co-culture on collagen sponges. an 11 species subgingival biofilm was used to challenge the generated tissue in the bioreactor for a period of 24 h. the histological and scanning electron microscopy analysis displayed an epithelial-like layer on the surface of the collagen sponge, supported by the underlying ingrowth of gingival fibroblasts, while monocytic cells were also found within the sponge mass. bacterial quantification of the biofilm showed that in the presence of the organotypic tissue, the growth of selected biofilm species, especially campylobacter rectus, actinomyces oris, streptococcus anginosus, veillonella dispar, and porphyromonas gingivalis, was suppressed, indicating a potential antimicrobial effect by the tissue. multiplex immunoassay analysis of cytokine secretion showed that interleukin (il)-1 beta, il-2, il-4, and tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha levels in cell culture supernatants were significantly up-regulated in presence of the biofilm, indicating a positive inflammatory response of the organotypic tissue to the biofilm challenge. in conclusion, this  novel host-biofilm interaction organotypic model might resemble the periodontal pocket and have an important impact on the study of periodontal infections, by minimizing the need for the use of experimental animal models.

TI  == oral bacterial dna findings in pericardial fluid.
AB  == background: we recently reported that large amounts of oral bacterial dna can be  found in thrombus aspirates of myocardial infarction patients. some case reports  describe bacterial findings in pericardial fluid, mostly done with conventional culturing and a few with pcr; in purulent pericarditis, nevertheless, bacterial pcr has not been used as a diagnostic method before. objective: to find out whether bacterial dna can be measured in the pericardial fluid and if it correlates with pathologic-anatomic findings linked to cardiovascular diseases. methods: twenty-two pericardial aspirates were collected aseptically prior to forensic autopsy at tampere university hospital during 2009-2010. of the autopsies, 10 (45.5%) were free of coronary artery disease (cad), 7 (31.8%) had mild and 5 (22.7%) had severe cad. bacterial dna amounts were determined using real-time quantitative pcr with specific primers and probes for all bacterial strains associated with endodontic disease (streptococcus mitis group, streptococcus anginosus group, staphylococcus aureus/staphylococcus epidermidis,  prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra) and periodontal disease (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatus, and dialister pneumosintes). results: of 22 cases, 14 (63.6%) were positive for endodontic and 8 (36.4%) for periodontal-disease-associated bacteria. only one case was positive for bacterial culturing. there was a statistically significant association between the relative amount of bacterial dna in the pericardial fluid and the severity of cad (p=0.035). conclusions: oral bacterial dna was detectable in pericardial fluid and an association between the severity of cad and the total amount of bacterial  dna in pericardial fluid was found, suggesting that this kind of measurement might be useful for clinical purposes.

TI  == colonisation of gingival epithelia by subgingival biofilms in vitro: role of "red complex" bacteria.
AB  == objectives: biofilm formation on tooth surface results in colonisation and invasion of the juxtaposed gingival tissue, eliciting strong inflammatory responses that lead to periodontal disease. this in vitro study investigated the  colonisation of human gingival multi-layered epithelium by multi-species subgingival biofilms, and evaluated the relative effects of the "red complex" species (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola). methods: the grown biofilm consisted of fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, veillonella dispar, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, t. denticola, actinomyces oris, streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus oralis, or its variant lacking the "red complex". after 48h in co-culture with the gingival epithelia, the bacterial species in the biofilm were quantified, whereas their localisation on the cell surface was investigated by combining confocal-laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation  (fish), as well as by scanning electron microscopy (sem). results: exclusion of the "red complex" quantitatively affected s. oralis, but not other species. the "red-complex" species were all able to colonise the gingival epithelial cells. a  co-localisation trend was observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola, as determined by fish. however, in the absence of all three "red complex" bacteria from the biofilm, an immense colonisation of streptococci (potentially s. oralis) was observed on the gingival epithelia, as confirmed by both clsm and sem. conclusions: while the "red complex" species synergise in colonizing gingival epithelia, their absence from the biofilm enhances streptococcal colonisation. this antagonism with streptococci reveals that the "red complex" may regulate biofilm virulence, with potential implications in periodontal pathogenesis.

TI  == impact of early colonizers on in vitro subgingival biofilm formation.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early colonizing species on the structure and the composition of the bacterial community developing in a subgingival 10-species biofilm model system. the model included streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, actinomycesoris, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp.  nucleatum, veillonella dispar, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. based on literature, we considered streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, and actinomyces oris as early colonizers and examined their role in the biofilms by either a delayed addition to the consortium, or by not inoculating at all the biofilms with these species. we quantitatively evaluated the resulting biofilms by real-time quantitative pcr and further compared the structures using confocal  laser scanning microscopy following fluorescence in situ hybridisation. the absence of the early colonizers did not hinder biofilm formation. the biofilms reached the same total counts and developed to normal thickness. however, quantitative shifts in the abundances of individual species were observed. in the absence of streptococci, the overall biofilm structure appeared looser and more dispersed. moreover, besides a significant increase of p. intermedia and a decrease of p. gingivalis , p. intermedia appeared to form filamented long chains that resembled streptococci. a. oris, although growing to significantly higher abundance in absence of streptococci, did not have a visible impact on the biofilms. hence, in the absence of the early colonizers, there is a pronounced effect on p. intermedia and p. gingivalis that may cause distinct shifts in the structure of the biofilm. streptococci possibly facilitate the establishment of p. gingivalis into subgingival biofilms, while in their absence p. intermedia became more dominant and forms elongated chains.

TI  == effects of short-chain fatty acids on actinomyces naeslundii biofilm formation.
AB  == actinomyces naeslundii is an early colonizer and has important roles in the development of the oral biofilm. short-chain fatty acids (scfa) are secreted extracellularly as a product of metabolism by gram-negative anaerobes, e.g. porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum; and the scfa may affect biofilm development with interaction between a. naeslundii and gram-negative bacteria. our aim was to investigate the effects of scfa on biofilm formation by  a. naeslundii and to determine the mechanism. we used the biofilm formation assay in 96-well microtiter plates in tryptic soy broth without dextrose and with 0.25% sucrose using safranin stain of the biofilm monitoring 492 nm absorbance. to determine the mechanism by scfa, the production of chaperones and stress-response proteins (grpe and groel) in biofilm formation was examined using western blot fluorescence activity with grpe and groel antibodies. adding butyric acid (6.25 mm) 0, 6 and 10 h after beginning culture significantly increased biofilm formation by a. naeslundii, and upregulation was observed at 16 h. upregulation was also observed using appropriate concentrations of other scfa. in the upregulated biofilm, production of grpe and groel was higher where membrane-damaged or dead cells were also observed. the upregulated biofilm was significantly reduced by addition of anti-groel antibody. the data suggest biofilm formation by a. naeslundii was upregulated dependent on the production of stress proteins, and addition of scfa increased membrane-damaged or dead cells. production of groel may physically play an important role in biofilm development.

TI  == no evidence of triclosan-resistant bacteria following long-term use of triclosan-containing toothpaste.
AB  == background and objective: there is a paucity of data in relation to the possible  emergence of triclosan (tcs)-resistant bacteria following long-term exposure to tcs toothpaste. therefore, this study investigated whether long-term continuous exposure to tcs in toothpaste selects for tcs-resistant bacteria within the oral  biofilm. material and methods: dental plaque samples were collected from 40 individuals during year 5 of a randomised controlled trial. participants had been randomly assigned to use tcs (3000 mug/ml tcs) (n = 18) or placebo toothpaste (n  = 22). diluted plaque samples were plated on to wilkins-chalgren agar plates containing 5% (v/v) laked sheep red blood cells and tcs (concentrations ranging from 25 to 150 mug/ml) and incubated at 37 degrees c under microaerophilic and anaerobic conditions for 2-10 d. selected bacterial isolates were identified by partial 16s rdna sequencing and tcs minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) determined for each isolate. results: at 3000 mug/ml tcs no growth was observed under microaerophilic or anaerobic conditions in either group. the mics of tcs for all isolates ranged from 125 to 1000 mug/ml in both groups. species common to both groups had similar mics. veillonella parvula and campylobacter gracilis were the most frequent isolates from both groups, with similar mics in both groups. conclusion: the use of tcs-containing toothpaste did not appear to lead to an increase in mic of tcs of oral bacterial isolates.

TI  == validation of antibiotic efficacy on in vitro subgingival biofilms.
AB  == background: systemic antibiotics are often used as adjunctive treatment modalities for periodontal diseases. testing of antimicrobial efficacy can be relevant only if the bacteria are in the form of biofilms rather than the planktonic state, and at concentrations of physiologic relevance, i.e., reachable in the periodontal pocket. the aim of the present study is to test the antimicrobial efficacy of five common antibiotic schemes at physiologically relevant concentrations on a multispecies in vitro biofilm model. methods: a 10-species in vitro subgingival biofilm model was exposed to metronidazole (15 mug/ml), amoxicillin (15 mug/ml), metronidazole and amoxicillin in combination, doxycycline (2 mug/ml), and azithromycin (10 mug/ml) over 24 hours. species-specific bacterial numbers were determined by culture on selective agar media or by epifluorescence microscopy. results: metronidazole alone did not affect biofilm composition. total bacterial counts were significantly reduced by  doxycycline, azithromycin, and amoxicillin alone or in combination with metronidazole, albeit by less than 1 log. on the species-specific level, these regimens significantly reduced the numbers of streptococcus anginosus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum, as well as campylobacter rectus (except for amoxicillin alone). the strongest effects were displayed by the combination of amoxicillin and metronidazole. conclusion: antibiotics at concentrations detectable in gingival crevicular fluid do not dramatically reduce total bacterial loads in this in vitro biofilm model, but cause species-specific  reductions, which may disrupt the biofilm unity.

TI  == validation of a quantitative real-time pcr assay and comparison with fluorescence microscopy and selective agar plate counting for species-specific quantification  of an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  == background and objective: subgingival biofilms are the prime etiological factor of periodontal disease. owing to their complex polymicrobial nature, quantification of individual bacterial species within the biofilm for research and diagnostic purposes can be methodologically challenging. the aims of this study were to establish a quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) assay to quantify the bacteria used in our 10-species in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm model and to compare the quantitative outcome with fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming  unit (cfu) counts on selective agar plates. material and methods: the 10 species  included in the in vitro biofilm were streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, actinomyces oris, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. the numbers of each species were quantified at two time points using qpcr, microscopy counting following fluorescence in-situ hybridization (fish) or immunofluorescence staining, and counting of cfus after growth on selective agar plates. results: all 10 species were successfully quantified using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, and the eight species culturable on selective agar plates were also quantified by counting the numbers  of cfus after growth on selective agar. in early biofilm cultures, all methods showed a significant correlation, although the absolute numbers differed between  methods. in late biofilm cultures, measurements obtained using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, but not by cfu counts, maintained significant correlation. cfu counts yielded lower values than did measurements made using the other two methods. conclusion: quantitative pcr and epifluorescence microscopy can be easily combined with each other to determine species-specific bacterial numbers within biofilms. however, conventional bacterial cultures cannot be as efficiently combined using these molecular detection methods. this may be crucial in designing and selecting appropriate clinical diagnostic methods for subgingival biofilm samples.

TI  == hydrogen sulfide production from cysteine and homocysteine by periodontal and oral bacteria.
AB  == background: hydrogen sulfide is one of the predominant volatile sulfur compounds  (vscs) produced by oral bacteria. this study developed and evaluated a system for detecting hydrogen sulfide production by oral bacteria. methods: l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase (metase) and beta carbon-sulfur (beta c-s) lyase were used to degrade homocysteine and cysteine, respectively, to produce hydrogen sulfide. enzymatic reactions resulting in hydrogen sulfide production were assayed by reaction with bismuth trichloride, which forms a black precipitate when mixed with hydrogen sulfide. the enzymatic activities of various oral bacteria that result in hydrogen sulfide production and the capacity of bacteria from periodontal sites to form hydrogen sulfide in reaction mixtures containing l-cysteine or dl-homocysteine were assayed. results: with l-cysteine as the substrate, streptococcus anginosus fw73 produced the most  hydrogen sulfide, whereas porphyromonas gingivalis american type culture collection (atcc) 33277 and w83 and fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953 produced approximately 35% of the amount produced by the p. gingivalis strains. finally, the hydrogen sulfide found in subgingival plaque was analyzed. using bismuth trichloride, the hydrogen sulfide produced by oral bacteria was visually detectable as a black precipitate. conclusions: hydrogen sulfide production by oral bacteria was easily analyzed using bismuth trichloride. however, further innovation is required for practical use.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == [periodontitis and cardiovascular disease].
AB  == the prevalence of periodontitis and cardiovascular disease (cvd) is high. a mixed infectious biofilm etiology of periodontitis is known but not fully established in cvd. cofactors; smoking habits, stress, ethnicity, genetics, socioeconomics and age contribute to both diseases. the objectives of this report are to summarize factors in regards to cvd and periodontitis that are clinically relevant. the hypothesis behind a relationship between the two conditions can be  founded in (i) shared infections etiology, (ii) shared inflammatory response, (iii) epidemiological and case-control studies, and (iv) periodontal studies demonstrating improvements of cvd markers. streptococcus species in the s. mitis  group, and s. anginosus group have been identified in periodontitis and are known as pathogens in endocarditis possibly transported from the oral cavity to the heart through bacteremia during dental therapies, and tooth brushing. other periodontal bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and parvimonas micra are beta-lactamase producing and may contribute to antibiotic resistance (extended spectrum beta-lactamases). other bacteria in cvd  and periodontitis include staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. chlamydia pneumoniae and p. gingivalis lipopolyysaccharide capsels share homology and induce heat-shock protein activity and a cascade of proinflammatory cytokines. associations between periodontitis and cvd have been presented in many studies when controlling for confounders. other studies have demonstrated that periodontal therapies increase brachial artery flow rate and reduce serum inflammatory cytokine levels. thus, physicians caring for subjects at cvd risk should consult with dentists/periodontists. dentists must improve their medical knowledge and also learn to consult with physicians when treating patients at cvd risk.

TI  == microbiological evaluation of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without sinus tract.
AB  == aim: to examine the microbiological status of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without a sinus tract. methodology: samples were collected by means of a size 15 h-type file and two sterile paper points from 30 cases of primary endodontic infections with (n = 15) or without (n = 15) a sinus tract. the presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: the species found at the highest levels and prevalence were fusobacterium nucleatum sp. vincentii, porphyromonas gingivalis,  veillonella parvula, enterococcus faecalis, campylobacter gracilis and neisseria  mucosa. total bacterial counts were similar between teeth with (44 x 10(5)) and without (50 x 10(5)) a sinus tract (t-test: p > 0.05). e. faecalis, streptococcus anginosus, capnocytophaga sputigena and capnocytophaga gingivalis had significantly higher counts in the absence of sinus tract (mann-whitney test, p < 0.05). higher levels of p. gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum were observed in cases with a sinus tract. leptotrichia buccalis (or = 1.83; ci 95%) and porphyromonas endodontalis (or = 2.15; ci 95%) were associated with an increased chance of subjects having a sinus tract. conclusions: primary endodontic infections were associated with a large variety of bacterial species.  specific differences between the composition of the microbiota of primary root canal infections were observed in cases with or without a sinus tract.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of mahonia aquifolium and two of its alkaloids against oral bacteria.
AB  == extracts or alkaloids isolated from mahonia aquifolium exhibit antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. in this study the bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal activities of a m. aquifolium  extract and two of its major alkaloids, berberine chloride and oxyacanthine sulphate, were tested in vitro against nine different oral bacteria. minimum inhibitory concentrations were in the range from < or = 0.0031% to 0.1993% for the m. aquifolium extract, from 0.002% to > 0.125% for berberine chloride, and from 0.0156% to > 0.0625% for oxyacanthine sulphate. the values for the minimum bactericidal concentrations were in the same range, indicating that the test substances most probably acted in a bactericidal manner. the most susceptible bacterium against all three test substances was porphyromonas gingivalis.

TI  == bacterial examination of endodontic infections by clonal analysis in concert with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to examine the diversity of bacterial  species in the infected root canals of teeth associated with endodontic abscesses by cloning and sequencing techniques in concert with denaturing high-performance  liquid chromatography. methods: samples collected from five infected root canals  were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with universal 16s ribosomal dna primers. products of these pcrs were cloned and sequenced. denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dhplc) was used as a screening method to  reduce the number of clones necessary for dna sequencing. results: all samples were positive for the presence of bacteria and a range of 7-13 different bacteria were found per root canal sample. in total, 48 different oral clones were detected among the five root canal samples. olsenella profusa was the only species present in all samples. porphyromonas gingivalis, dialister pneumosintes, dialister invisus, lachnospiraceae oral clone, staphylococcus aureus, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, peptostreptococcus micros and enterococcus faecalis were found in two of the five samples. the majority of the taxa were present in only one sample, for example tannerella forsythia, shuttleworthia satelles and filifactor alocis. some facultative anaerobes that are frequently isolated from endodontic infections such as e. faecalis, streptococcus anginosus  and lactobacillus spp. were also found in this study. conclusion: clonal analysis of the microflora associated with endodontic infections revealed a wide diversity of oral species.

AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in 111 selected cases of single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. methods: samples were collected from the  root canals using #15 hedstroen-type files and two sterile paper points, which were introduced 1 mm short of the apical foramen. the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 different bacterial species in each sample were determined using dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization techniques. results: the  mean number of species per sample was 22. enterococcus faecalis (89.3%), campylobacter gracilis (89.3%), leptotrichia buccalis (89.3%), neisseria mucosa (87.5%), prevotella melaninogenica (86.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii (85.7%), eubacterium saburreum (75.9%), streptococcus anginosus (75%),  and veillonella parvula (74.1%) were the most prevalent species. the species found in highest mean counts (over 10(5)) were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii (13.14 x 10(5)), e. saburreum (5.67 x 10(5)), e. faecalis (5.38 x 10(5)), n. mucosa (4.19 x 10(5)), v. parvula (3.63 x 10(5)), c. gracilis (3.46 x 10(5)), treponema  socranskii (3.34 x 10(5)), porphyromonas endodontalis (2.96 x 10(5)), porphyromonas gingivalis (2.85 x 10(5)), micromonas micros (2.81 x 10(5)), prevotella nigrescens (2.68 x 10(5)) and fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (2.64 x 10(5)). most of these species were also found in high proportions. conclusions: our results suggest that several bacterial species considered to be  oral pathogens seem to be implicated in the etiology of primary endodontic infections.

TI  == microbiological composition associated with interleukin-1 gene polymorphism in subjects undergoing supportive periodontal therapy.
AB  == background: interleukin-1 gene polymorphism (il-1 gene) has been associated with  periodontitis. the present study examined the subgingival microbiota by il-1 gene status in subjects undergoing supportive periodontal therapy (spt). methods: a total of 151 subjects with known il-1 gene status (il-1a +4845/il-1b -3954) (il-1 gene) were included in this study. clinical data and subgingival plaque samples (40 taxa) were collected. these taxa were determined by the checkerboard dna-dna  hybridization method. results: gender, smoking habits (n-par tests), age, and clinical periodontal conditions did not differ by il-1 gene status. il-1 gene-negative subjects had a higher total bacterial load (mean difference, 480.4  x 10(5); 95% confidence interval [ci], 77 to 884 x 10(5); p <0.02). the levels of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (mean difference, 30.7 x 10(5); 95% ci, 2.2  to 59.5 x 10(5); p <0.05), eubacterium nodatum (mean difference, 4.2 x 10(5); 95% ci, 0.6 to 7.8 x 10(5); p <0.02), porphyromonas gingivalis (mean difference, 17.9 x 10(5); 95% ci, 1.2 to 34.5 x 10(5); p <0.05), and streptococcus anginosus (mean difference, 4.0 x 10(5); 95% ci, 0.2 to 7.2 x 10(5); p <0.05) were higher in il-1 gene-negative subjects, an observation specifically found at sites with probing depths <5.0 mm. conclusions: bleeding on probing did not differ by il gene status, reflecting clinical spt efficacy. il-1 gene-negative subjects had higher  levels of periodontal pathogens. this may suggest that among subjects undergoing  spt, a lower bacterial load is required in il-1 gene-positive subjects to develop the same level of periodontitis as in il-1 gene-negative subjects.

AB  == background: periodontitis has been identified as a potential risk factor in cardiovascular diseases. it is possible that the stimulation of host responses to oral infections may result in vascular damage and the inducement of blood clotting. the aim of this study was to assess the role of periodontal infection and bacterial burden as an explanatory variable to the activation of the inflammatory process leading to acute coronary syndrome (acs). methods: a total of 161 consecutive surviving cases admitted with a diagnosis of acs and 161 control subjects, matched with cases according to their gender, socioeconomic level, and smoking status, were studied. serum white blood cell (wbc) counts, high- and low-density lipoprotein (hdl/ldl) levels, high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsc-rp) levels, and clinical periodontal routine parameters were studied. the subgingival pathogens were assayed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: total oral bacterial load was higher in the subjects with acs (mean difference: 17.4x10(5); sd: 10.8; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 4.2 to 17.4; p<0.001), and significant for 26 of 40 species including porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, and treponema denticola. serum wbc counts, hsc-rp levels, streptococcus intermedius, and streptococcus sanguis,  were explanatory factors to acute coronary syndrome status (nagelkerke r2=0.49).  conclusion: the oral bacterial load of s. intermedius, s. sanguis, streptococcus  anginosus, t. forsythensis, t. denticola, and p. gingivalis may be concomitant risk factors in the development of acs.

TI  == the efficacy of povidone-iodine products against periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == a total of 8 strains of 6 bacterial species, porphyromonas gingivalis atcc33277 and tdc286, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans atcc29523 and jp2, fusobacterium nucleatum no. 2, tannerella forsythensis atcc43937, prevotella intermedia atcc25611 and streptococcus anginosus atcc33397, were treated with povidone-iodine (pvp-i) gargle (pvp-i: 0.47 and 0.23% w/v) or chlorhexidine gluconate (chg) gargle (chg: 0.002% w/v) for 15, 30 or 60 s, after which they were inoculated into various media, cultured and counted for residual bacteria. at both concentrations, pvp-i gargle reduced the viable cell count of all 8 bacterial strains to below the measurable limit within 15 s. by contrast, there were more than 1,000 viable colonies 60 s following treatment with the chg gargle. the results demonstrate that povidone-iodine gargle has rapid bactericidal activity against the causative bacteria of periodontal disease.

TI  == luxs-based signaling affects streptococcus mutans biofilm formation.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is implicated as a major etiological agent in human dental caries, and one of the important virulence properties of this organism is its ability to form biofilms (dental plaque) on tooth surfaces. we examined the role  of autoinducer-2 (ai-2) on s. mutans biofilm formation by constructing a gs-5 luxs-null mutant. biofilm formation by the luxs mutant in 0.5% sucrose defined medium was found to be markedly attenuated compared to the wild type. scanning electron microscopy also revealed that biofilms of the luxs mutant formed larger  clumps in sucrose medium compared to the parental strain. therefore, the expression of glucosyltransferase genes was examined and the gtfb and gtfc genes, but not the gtfd gene, in the luxs mutant were upregulated in the mid-log growth  phase. furthermore, we developed a novel two-compartment system to monitor ai-2 production by oral streptococci and periodontopathic bacteria. the biofilm defect of the luxs mutant was complemented by strains of s. gordonii, s. sobrinus, and s. anginosus; however, it was not complemented by s. oralis, s. salivarius, or s. sanguinis. biofilm formation by the luxs mutant was also complemented by porphyromonas gingivalis 381 and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 but not  by a p. gingivalis luxs mutant. these results suggest that the regulation of the  glucosyltransferase genes required for sucrose-dependent biofilm formation is regulated by ai-2. furthermore, these results provide further confirmation of previous proposals that quorum sensing via ai-2 may play a significant role in oral biofilm formation.

TI  == correlations between bacterial levels in autologous subgingival plaque and saliva of adult sudanese.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess levels of oral bacteria and their correlations in paired samples of saliva and subgingival plaque in a population of adult sudanese. whole saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples from six probing sites of one tooth in each jaw were obtained from 56 sudanese adults (mean age 35.2+/-8.9 years). levels of 24 oral bacteria in the autologous saliva  and pooled plaque sample of each subject were assessed by dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. there were significantly ( p< or =0.01) higher percentages of subjects with > or =10(5) bacterial cells of prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, veillonella parvula, streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus salivarius, and leptotrichia buccalis and significantly ( p< or =0.01) lower percentages with treponema denticola in saliva than in subgingival plaque. the detection frequencies at > or =10(6) bacterial cells were significantly higher for selenomonas sputigena, s. anginosus, streptococcus sanguis, and s. salivarius and significantly lower for porphyromonas gingivalis in saliva than in subgingival plaque ( p< or =0.01). porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, s. sputigena, s. sanguis, and streptococcus mitis demonstrated significant ( p< or =0.05) positive correlations between their levels in plaque and saliva. this study indicates that the levels of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, s.  sanguis, and s. mitis correlate significantly in saliva and subgingival plaque and that higher accuracy of detection and assessment of the levels of these bacteria in the oral cavity may be achieved by concurrent sampling of saliva and  subgingival plaque.

TI  == cross-reactivity between human sialyl lewis(x) oligosaccharide and common causative oral bacteria of infective endocarditis.
AB  == the expression of sialy-lewis(x) (sle(x); neu5ac alpha 2-3 gal beta 1-4) (fuc alpha 1-3) glcnac-r) on oral bacteria producing infective endocarditis was determined by a whole-cell enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and an immunoelectron microscopy using the well-characterized anti-sle(x) monoclonal antibody snh-3 (mab snh-3; igm class). mab snh-3 reacted strongly with whole cells of oral bacteria: streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus pyogenes, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens and porphyromonas gingivalis. the negatively stained immuno-electron micrograph of streptococcus pyogenes showed many reactive gold particles on the cell surface. our findings demonstrated the existence of immunologic mimicry between the sle(x) oligosaccharide and cell surface antigens of many species associated with infective endocarditis. we propose the hypothesis that if these bacteria escape their normal habitats, the surface components that mimic the sle(x) oligosaccharide might bind to host antigens of the selectin family which could promote binding to endothelial cells and, consequently, initiation of the events  leading to infective endocarditis.

TI  == the antimicrobial activity of prevention mouthrinse.
AB  == prevention mouthrinse was designed to serve as a vital supplement to normal oral  hygiene procedures. to determine the antimicrobial potency of this mouthrinse, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics), bactericidal kinetics, and short-term exposure studies were conducted. a spectrum of oral microorganisms was employed in this investigation: streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, serratia  marcescens and candida albicans. microorganisms were cultured in standard enriched media and under appropriate atmospheric conditions. inhibition assays were conducted in tubes, with each mouthrinse dilution assayed in triplicate. mic determinations revealed that all of the microorganisms studied were highly susceptible to prevention mouthrinse, with mics ranging from 16-fold to 128-fold  dilutions. bactericidal kinetics assays showed rapid killing of the test organisms in the presence of the mouthrinse. brief (5-minute) exposure of s. mutans to 8-fold diluted mouthrinse resulted in a substantial delay in growth. under the constraints of this type of study, prevention mouthrinse exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against all of the microorganisms studied. we support the notion that prevention mouthrinse may be a valuable supplement to normal oral hygiene procedures. a 6-month clinical trial assessing the in vivo efficacy of prevention mouthrinse is currently being conducted.

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine on proteolytic and glycosidic enzyme activities of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == chlorhexidine was tested for its ability to inhibit a wide range of glycosidic and proteolytic enzyme activities produced by treponema denticola, porphyromonas  gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga orchracea, capnocytophaga sp., actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguis. the enzymes produced by capnocytophaga spp. were the most resistant to inhibition by chlorhexidine while  the hydrolysis of proteolytic substrates by all the other species was markedly susceptible to inhibition with less than 0.125 mm chlorhexidine inhibiting enzyme activities by greater than or equal to 50%. glycosidase activities, of all species, were generally more resistant to inhibition, especially neuraminidase activity. chlorhexidine at less than 0.032 mm inhibited the degradation of bovine serum albumin by suspensions of dental plaque bacteria. these observations support an hypothesis that chlorhexidine exerts a bacteristatic effect in vivo, in part, by reducing the ability of dental plaque bacteria to degrade host-derived proteins and glycoproteins which normally provide essential nutrients for growth.
