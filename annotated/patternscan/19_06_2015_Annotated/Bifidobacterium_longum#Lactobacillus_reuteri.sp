TI  == effect of traditional leafy vegetables on the growth of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria.
AB  == traditional leafy vegetables, apart from being a staple in the diet of most of sub-saharan africa, are an essential part of traditional medicine and are used daily by traditional healers in the region to treat a wide variety of ailments. in this study, a batch culture technique was used to investigate whether 25 infusions from 22 traditional leafy vegetables stimulated the growth of lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus lactis, lactobacillus reuteri and bifidobacterium longum in pure culture. high performance liquid chromatography was used to determine the inulin content of the infusions. sonchus oleraceus stimulated all four strains and taraxacum officinale stimulated three strains. in total, 18 plants stimulated at least one of the four probiotic strains. the inulin content of the infusions varied between 2.5% and 3.6%, with asparagus sprengeri containing the highest percentage. these results indicate that traditional leafy vegetables do stimulate the growth of the selected lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in pure culture and contain inulin. these infusions can now be tested for prebiotic potential using mixed culture systems or human hosts.

TI  == influence of bovine lactoferrin on the growth of selected probiotic bacteria under aerobic conditions.
AB  == bovine lactoferrin (blf) is a natural glycoprotein, and it shows broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. however, reports on the influences of blf on probiotic bacteria have been mixed. we examined the effects of apo-blf (between 0.25 and 128 mg/ml) on both aerobic and anaerobic cultures of probiotics. we found that blf had similar effects on the growth of probiotics under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, and that it actively and significantly (at concentrations of >0.25 mg/ml) retarded the growth rate of bifidobacterium bifidum (atcc 29521), b. longum (atcc 15707), b. lactis (bcrc 17394), b. infantis (atcc 15697), lactobacillus reuteri (atcc 23272), l. rhamnosus (atcc 53103), and l. coryniformis (atcc 25602) in a dose-dependent manner. otherwise, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were 128 or >128 mg/ml against b. bifidum, b. longum, b. lactis, l. reuteri, and l. rhamnosus (atcc 53103). with regard to mics, blf showed at least four-fold lower inhibitory effect on probiotics than on pathogens. intriguingly, blf (>0.25 mg/ml) significantly enhanced the growth of rhamnosus (atcc 7469) and l. acidophilus (bcrc 14065) by approximately 40-200 %,  during their late periods of growth. supernatants produced from aerobic but not anaerobic cultures of l. acidophilus reduced the growth of escherichia coli by about 20 %. thus, blf displayed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the growth  of most probiotic strains under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. an antibacterial supernatant prepared from the aerobic cultures may have significant practical use.

TI  == strain-dependent augmentation of tight-junction barrier function in human primary epidermal keratinocytes by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium lysates.
AB  == in this study, we investigated whether probiotic lysates can modify the tight-junction function of human primary keratinocytes. the keratinocytes were grown on cell culture inserts and treated with lysates from bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus fermentum,  or lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. with the exception of l. fermentum (which decreased cell viability), all strains markedly enhanced tight-junction barrier function within 24 h, as assessed by measurements of transepithelial electrical resistance (teer). however, b. longum and l. rhamnosus gg were the most efficacious, producing dose-dependent increases in resistance that were maintained for 4 days. these increases in teer correlated with elevated expression of tight-junction protein components. neutralization of toll-like receptor 2 abolished both the increase in teer and expression of tight-junction proteins induced by b. longum, but not l. rhamnosus gg. these data suggest that some bacterial strains increase tight-junction function via modulation of protein components but the different pathways involved may vary depending on the bacterial strain.

TI  == effect of probiotics lactobacillus and bifidobacterium on gut-derived lipopolysaccharides and inflammatory cytokines: an in vitro study using a human colonic microbiota model.
AB  == gut-derived lipopolysaccharides (lps) are critical to the development and progression of chronic low-grade inflammation and metabolic diseases. in this study, the effects of probiotics lactobacillus and bifidobacterium on gut-derived lipopolysaccharide and inflammatory cytokine concentrations were evaluated using  a human colonic microbiota model. lactobacillus reuteri, l. rhamnosus, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium animalis, b. bifidum, b. longum, and b. longum subsp.  infantis were identified from the literature for their anti-inflammatory potential. each bacterial culture was administered daily to a human colonic microbiota model during 14 days. colonic lipopolysaccharides, and gram-positive and negative bacteria were quantified. raw 264.7 macrophage cells were stimulated with supernatant from the human colonic microbiota model. concentrations of tnf-alpha, il-1beta, and il-4 cytokines were measured. lipopolysaccharide concentrations were significantly reduced with the administration of b. bifidum (-46.45 +/- 5.65%), l. rhamnosus (-30.40 +/- 5.08%), b. longum (-42.50 +/- 1.28%), and b. longum subsp. infantis (-68.85 +/- 5.32%) (p < 0.05). cell counts  of gram-negative and positive bacteria were distinctly affected by the probiotic  administered. there was a probiotic strain-specific effect on immunomodulatory responses of raw 264.7 macrophage cells. b. longum subsp. infantis demonstrated higher capacities to reduce tnf-alpha concentrations (-69.41 +/- 2.78%; p < 0.05) and to increase il-4 concentrations (+16.50 +/- 0.59%; p < 0.05). colonic lipopolysaccharides were significantly correlated with tnf-alpha and il-1beta concentrations (p < 0.05). these findings suggest that specific probiotic bacteria, such as b. longum subsp. infantis, might decrease colonic lipopolysaccharide concentrations, which might reduce the proinflammatory tone. this study has noteworthy applications in the field of biotherapeutics for the prevention and/or treatment of inflammatory and metabolic diseases.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == protection of probiotic bacteria in a synbiotic matrix following aerobic storage  at 4 degrees c.
AB  == the survival of single strains of bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum,  lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus reuteri was investigated in synbiotics that included 10 mg/ml of fructo-oligosaccharides, inulin and pectic-oligosaccharides in an alginate matrix under refrigerated (4 degrees c) aerobic storage conditions. when the matrices were cross-linked with calcium (45  mm), 102-103 cfu/ml of l. acidophilus and l. reuteri, and 0-103 cfu/ml of b. breve and b. longum survived refrigerated aerobic storage for 28 days. following  refrigerated storage, acetic (3-9 mm), butyric (0-2 mm), propionic (5-16 mm) and  lactic acids (1-48 mm) were produced during the growth of probiotics in bhi broth at 37 degrees c, suggesting their metabolic activity after storage was stressed.  when calcium cross-linking was not used in synbiotics, the matrix remained more gel-like after inoculation when compared to the calcium cross-linked matrix. at least 107 cfu/ml of probiotic bacteria survived after 21 days of storage within these gel-like alginate matrices. significantly higher levels of b. breve, l. acidophilus and l. reuteri were obtained from the synbiotic matrices supplemented with fructo-oligosaccharides, inulin and pectic-oligosaccharides compared to alginate alone. b. longum survival was the same (~7 logs) in all gel-like synbiotic matrices. these results show that synbiotics protected probiotic bacteria and extended their shelf-life under refrigerated aerobic conditions. synbiotics represent a viable delivery vehicle for health-promoting bacteria.

TI  == comparative effects of six probiotic strains on immune function in vitro.
AB  == there is considerable interest in the strain specificity of immune modulation by  probiotics. the present study compared the immunomodulatory properties of six probiotic strains of different species and two genera in a human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) model in vitro. live cells of lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei shirota, l. rhamnosus gg, l. plantarum ncimb 8826 and l. reuteri ncimb 11951) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum sp 07/3 and b. bifidum mf 20/5) were individually incubated with pbmc from seven healthy subjects for 24 h. probiotic strains increased the proportion of cd69+ on lymphocytes, t cells, t cell subsets and natural killer (nk) cells, and increased the proportion of cd25+, mainly on lymphocytes and nk cells. the effects on activation marker expression did not appear to be strain specific. nk cell activity was significantly increased by all six strains, without any significant difference between strains. probiotic strains increased production of il-1beta, il-6, il-10, tnf-alpha, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha to different extents, but had no effect on the production of il-2, il-4, il-5 or tnf-beta. the cytokines that showed strain-specific modulation included il-10, interferon-gamma, tnf-alpha, il-12p70, il-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1. the lactobacillus strains tended to promote t helper 1 cytokines, whereas bifidobacterial strains tended to produce a more anti-inflammatory profile. the results suggest that there was limited evidence of strain-specific effects of probiotics with respect to t cell and nk cell activation or nk cell activity, whereas production of some cytokines was differentially influenced by probiotic strains.

TI  == probiotic use in the critically ill.
AB  == probiotics are "live microbes which when administered in adequate amounts confer  a health benefit to the host" (fao/who joint group). their potential role in bio-ecological modification of pathological internal milieu of the critically ill is under evaluation. probiotics are available as single microbial strain (e.g., bacillus clausii, lactobacillus) or as a mix of multiple strains of lactobacillus (acidophilus, sporogenes, lactis, reuteri rc-14, gg, and l. plantarum 299v), bifidobacterium (bifidum, longum, infantis), streptococcus (thermophillus, lactis, fecalis), saccharomyces boulardii etc. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are gram-positive, anaerobic, lactic acid bacteria. these are normal inhabitant of human gut and colonize the colon better than others. critical illness and its  treatment create hostile environment in the gut and alters the micro flora favoring growth of pathogens. therapy with probiotics is an effort to reduce or eliminate potential pathogens and toxins, to release nutrients, antioxidants, growth factors and coagulation factors, to stimulate gut motility and to modulate innate and adaptive immune defense mechanisms via the normalization of altered gut flora. scientific evidence shows that use of probiotics is effective in prevention and therapy of antibiotic associated diarrhea. however, available probiotics strains in currently used doses do not provide much needed early benefits, and need long-term administration to have clinically beneficial effects (viz, a reduction in rate of infection, severe sepsis, icu stay, ventilation days and mortality) in critically ill surgical and trauma patients. possibly, available strains do not adhere to intestinal mucosa early, or may require higher dose than what is used. gap exists in our knowledge regarding mechanisms of action of different probiotics, most effective strains--single or multiple, cost  effectiveness, risk-benefit potential, optimum dose, frequency and duration of treatment etc. more information is needed on safety profile of probiotics in immunocompromised state of the critically ill in view of rare reports of fungemia and sepsis and a trend toward possible increase in nosocomial infection. at present, despite theoretical potential benefits, available evidence is not conclusive to recommend probiotics for routine use in the critically ill.

TI  == microencapsulated bile salt hydrolase producing lactobacillus reuteri for oral targeted delivery in the gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == this is the first study of its kind to screen probiotic lactic acid bacteria for  the purpose of microencapsulating a highly bile salt hydrolase (bsh)-active strain. a lactobacillus reuteri strain and a bifidobacterium longum strain were isolated as the highest bsh producers among the candidates. microcapsules were prepared with a diameter of 619 +/- 31 mum and a cell load of 5 x 10(9) cfu/ml. post de man, rogosa, and sharpe broth-acid challenge, l. reuteri microcapsules metabolized glyco- and tauro-conjugated bile salts at rates of 10.16 +/- 0.46 and 1.85 +/- 0.33 micromol/g microcapsule per hour, respectively, over the first 2 h. microencapsulated b. longum had minimal bsh activity and were significantly (p <  0.05) more susceptible to acid challenge. further testing of l. reuteri microcapsules in a simulated human gastrointestinal (gi) model showed an improved rate, with 49.4 +/- 6.21% of glyco-conjugates depleted after 60 min and complete  deconjugation after 4 h. microcapsules protected the encased cells in the simulated stomach maintaining l. reuteri viability above 10(9), 10(8), and 10(6)  cfu/ml after 2 h at ph 3.0, 2.5, and 2.0, respectively. results show excellent potential for this highly bsh-active microencapsulation system in vitro, highlighted by improved viability and substrate utilization in simulated gi transit.

TI  == in vitro screening of probiotic characteristics of some italian products.
AB  == six commercial probiotic products produced and marketed italy (containing lactobacillus gg, lactobacillus casei dg, lactobacillus reuteri, bacillus clausii spores, bifidobacterium longum and saccharomyces boulardii) were assayed for their stability during storage, acid, base and bile tolerance and adherence to human intestinal cells. results indicate that storage, even at conditions established by manufacturers, affects the microbial content of products based on  b. longum and partially of that containing l. casei gg . differences in acid and  bile tolerance were found for the products, s. boulardii being better able to survive acid and bile than bacteria. vegetative cells of b. clausii and b. longum were more susceptible than lactobacilli to low ph values, while fewer differences were found for bile tolerance. lactobacilli and only partially b. longum, were able to adhere to caco-2 cells, while s. boulardii and b. clausii showed reduced  adherence to human intestinal cells. in conclusion, the products did not completely fulfill all probiotic attributes.

TI  == survival of escherichia coli o157:h7 in dry fermented sausages containing micro-encapsulated probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == escherichia coli o157:h7 is capable of surviving the rigorous processing steps during the manufacture of dry fermented sausages. the effect of adding two probiotic organisms, lactobacillus reuteri and bifidobacterium longum as co-cultures with the meat starter cultures pediococcus pentosaceus and staphylococcus carnosus on the viability of e. coli o157:h7 in dry fermented sausages was studied. a 5 strain cocktail of e. coli o157:h7 was added at 7.4 log cfu/g to the sausage batter and challenged with either or both lb. reuteri or b.  longum before or after they were micro-encapsulated. sausages were fermented at < or = 26 degrees c and 88% relative humidity (rh) followed by drying at 75% rh and 13 degrees c for 25 d. the ph, water activity (aw), protein, moisture, and numbers of all inoculated organisms were monitored during processing. the ph and  aw decreased from 5.7 and 0.98 to 4.9 and 0.88 at the end of fermentation and drying, respectively. these processes reduced e. coli o157:h7 by 1.0 and 0.7 log  cfu/g at the end of fermentation and drying, respectively. unencapsulated lb. reuteri with or without b. longum reduced e. coli o157:h7 by 3.0 log cfu/g and b. longum caused a 1.9 log cfu/g reduction. while micro-encapsulation increased survival of lb. reuteri and b. longum, it reduced their inhibitory action against e. coli o157:h7.

TI  == light sensitivity of bifidobacterium longum in bioreactor cultivations.
AB  == bifidobacteria are gaining commercial significance due to their probiotic properties. however, little is still known about the production of these bacteria and their behavior in bioreactors. two bifidobacterium longum strains were sensitive to light when grown in a transparent (glass) bioreactor under microaerophilic growth conditions (i.e. no gases added and slow mixing). the sensitivity was less clear the more anaerobic the initial conditions were. in a darkened bioreactor in microaerophilic conditions, the two strains grew with maximum specific growth rates of 0.36 h(-1) and 0.48 h(-1). in an illuminated bioreactor neither strain grew. in comparison, lactobacillus reuteri was not sensitive to light under the same conditions.

TI  == the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora of the human intestine: composition and succession.
AB  == lactobacillus and bifidobacterial cultures are increasingly used as probiotics in pharmaceuticals and in foods. the selection of strains is performed often for technological rather than for microecological reasons. detailed reports about species and strains composition of these microorganisms in the intestinal microflora of man are rare. our investigations were performed with samples originating from infants and adults, taken from faeces and from upper sections of the intestinal tract including mouth and stomach, and from caecum and colon. post mortem cases as well as test subjects under physiological conditions were analyzed using an automatic capsule system sampling at defined times in different parts of the intestinal tract. the fate of selected strains after oral intake was studied, too. furthermore, influences of the microflora originating from food were considered. the identification of autochthonous (indigenous) and allochthonous (transient) species could be achieved with descriptions of new species in the genera lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. l. gasseri and l. reuteri proved to be predominant autochthonous lactobacillus species in infants as well as in adults. both species were occasionally present even in the stomach. this was also the case with an anaerobic lactic acid bacterium, previously named  catenabacterium catenaforme, later classified as l. ruminis, a non-motile variant of this species. the bifidobacterial microflora differed in composition between infants and adults and in different stages of the host's life. up to 5 species or special strains of bifidobacteria could be present in different, individually fixed, combinations. species typical for infants were b. bifidum, b. infantis, b. breve, and b. parvulorum. typical for adults were 4 different variants of b. adolescentis. b. bifidum and b. longum could often be found in both groups, but in lower numbers. b. longum showed some oxygen tolerance whereas b. bifidum and b. adolescentis required strict anaerobic and fastidious conditions for cultivation. the autochthonous lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora in man will remain stable life-long. with lactobacilli, however, some successions may be caused by transient species derived from food or from the oral cavity, thus giving the impression of an altered microflora. nevertheless l. gasseri, l.  reuteri, l. ruminis, and to some degree, l. salivarius, may be present as autochthonous species all of the time. with bifidobacteria, a decreasing tendency in counts and in multiple composition in elderly people exists. furthermore, this microflora is also influenced by consumption habits, which are probably caused by geographical circumstances.

TI  == taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and enterococcus. the physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. in total, 176 strains, including  the type strains, have been included. phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic  proteins. genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and dna-dna hybridization for bifidobacteria. in the genus lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: l. acidophilus group, l. casei group and l. reuteri/l. fermentum group. most strains referred to as l. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as l. gasseri or as l. johnsonii, both members of the l. acidophilus group. a similar situation could be shown in the l. casei group, where most of the strains named l. casei belonged to l. paracasei subspp. a recent proposal to reject the species l. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species l. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. according to phenotypic features and confirmed by dna-dna hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to b. animalis, although they were often declared as b. longum by the manufacturer. from the genus enterococcus, probiotic ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the  vana-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. these unwanted resistances could  be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kda resistance protein. in conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood  by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.
