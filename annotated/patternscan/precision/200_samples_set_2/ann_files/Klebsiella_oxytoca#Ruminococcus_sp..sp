TI  == construction of allitol synthesis pathway by multi-enzyme coexpression in escherichia coli and its application in allitol production.
AB  == an engineered strain for the conversion of d-fructose to allitol was developed by constructing a multi-enzyme coupling pathway and cofactor recycling system in escherichia coli. d-psicose-3-epimerase from ruminococcus sp. and ribitol dehydrogenase from klebsiella oxytoca were coexpressed to form the multi-enzyme coupling pathway for allitol production. the cofactor recycling system was constructed using the formate dehydrogenase gene from candida methylica for continuous nadh supply. the recombinant strain produced 10.62 g/l allitol from 100 mm d-fructose. to increase the intracellular concentration of the substrate,  the glucose/fructose facilitator gene from zymomonas mobilis was incorporated into the engineered strain. the results showed that the allitol yield was enhanced significantly to 16.53 g/l with a conversion rate of 92 %. through optimizing conversion conditions, allitol was produced effectively on a large scale by the whole-cell biotransformation system; the yield reached 48.62 g/l when 500 mm d-fructose was used as the substrate.
