TI  == isolation and characterization of chromium(vi)-reducing bacteria from tannery effluents.
AB  == two chromium-resistant bacteria (ifr-2 and ifr-3) capable of reducing/transforming cr(vi) to cr(iii) were isolated from tannery effluents. isolates ifr-2 and ifr-3 were identified as staphylococcus aureus and pediococcus pentosaceus respectively by 16s rrna gene sequence analyses. both isolates can grow well on 2,000 mg/l cr(vi) (as k(2)cr(2)o(7)) in luria-bertani (lb) medium. reduction of cr(vi) was found to be growth-associated in both isolates and ifr-2  and ifr-3 reduced 20 mg/l cr(vi) completely in 6 and 24 h respectively. the cr(vi) reduction due to chromate reductase activity was detected in the culture supernatant and cell lysate but not at all in the cell extract supernatant of both isolates. whole cells of ifr-2 and ifr-3 converted 24 and 30% of the initial cr(vi) concentration (1 mg/l) in 45 min respectively at 37 degrees c. nicl(2) stimulated the growth of ifr-2 whereas hgcl(2) and cdcl(2) significantly inhibited the growth of both isolates. optimum temperature and ph for growth of and cr(vi) reduction by both isolates were found to be between 35 and 40 degrees  c and ph 7.0 to 8.0. the two bacterial isolates can be good candidates for detoxification of cr(vi) in industrial effluents.

TI  == influence of nacl and nano3 on sinigrin hydrolysis by foodborne bacteria.
AB  == the glucosinolate sinigrin (sng) is converted by endogenous plant myrosinase or by bacterial myrosinase-like activity to form the potent antimicrobial allyl isothiocyanate. in order to use sng as a natural antimicrobial precursor in food, it became important to better understand the ability of bacteria to synthesize the enzyme(s) and understand factors influencing this synthesis at a constant sng concentration. eight spoilage, pathogenic, or starter culture bacteria were grown separately in medium containing individual or combined salts with sng. sng degradation by the bacteria and the formation of its major degradation product, allyl isothiocyanate, were followed for 12 days at 30 or 35 degrees c. the bacterial strains varied in their ability to metabolize sng, and this was enhanced by nacl and/or nano(3). sng hydrolysis took place after 4 days, and the  greatest amount occurred by day 12. at 12 days, escherichia coli o157:h7 showed the greatest capacity to hydrolyze sng (45.3% degradation), followed by staphylococcus carnosus (44.57%), while pseudomonas fluorescens was not active against sng. the ability of tested strains to metabolize sng, in decreasing order, was as follows: escherichia coli o157:h7 > staphylococcus carnosus > staphylococcus aureus > pediococcus pentosaceus > salmonella typhimurium > listeria monocytogenes > enterococcus faecalis > pseudomonas fluorescens.

TI  == homologues and bioengineered derivatives of ltnj vary in ability to form d-alanine in the lantibiotic lacticin 3147.
AB  == ltnalpha and ltnbeta are individual components of the two-peptide lantibiotic lacticin 3147 and are unusual in that, although ribosomally synthesized, they contain d-amino acids. these result from the dehydration of l-serine to dehydroalanine by ltnm and subsequent stereospecific hydrogenation to d-alanine by ltnj. homologues of ltnj are rare but have been identified in silico in staphylococcus aureus c55 (sacj), pediococcus pentosaceus fbb61 (penn), and nostoc punctiforme pcc73102 (npnj, previously called npunj [p. d. cotter et al.,  proc. natl. acad. sci. u. s. a. 102:18584-18589, 2005]). here, the ability of these enzymes to catalyze d-alanine formation in the lacticin 3147 system was assessed through heterologous enzyme production in a deltaltnj mutant. penn successfully incorporated d-alanines in both peptides, and sacj modified ltnalpha only, while npnj was unable to modify either peptide. site-directed mutagenesis was also employed to identify residues of key importance in ltnj. the most surprising outcome from these investigations was the generation of peptides by specific ltnj mutants which exhibited less bioactivity than those generated by the deltaltnj strain. we have established that the reduced activity of these peptides is due to the inability of the associated ltnj enzymes to generate d-alanine residues in a stereospecific manner, resulting in the presence of both  d- and l-alanines at the relevant locations in the lacticin 3147 peptides.

TI  == characterization of anti-listeria bacteriocins isolated from shellfish: potential antimicrobials to control non-fermented seafood.
AB  == this work had as main objectives to characterize two bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria (lab) previously isolated from non-fermented seafood, in order to evaluate their potential as new food protective agents. the two bacteriocinogenic isolates were identified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using genus- and species-specific primers, and confirmed by 16s rdna sequencing,  as enterococcus faecium and pediococcus pentosaceus. the antimicrobial spectrum of each strain included several indicator microorganisms, some of them also isolated from seafood. growth of listeria innocua, l. monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus and other lab species were inhibited, although no inhibition of gram-negative microorganisms was observed. proteolytic, but not lipolytic or glycolytic enzymes, completely inactivated the antimicrobial effect of both cell-free supernatants confirming the proteinaceous nature of the  inhibitors. the antimicrobial activity was maintained after treatment with nacl,  sds, triton x-100, tween 20, tween 80 and edta after 2 h or 5 h of exposure and both bacteriocins were stable over a wide range of ph and temperatures. production of bacteriocin by e. faecium (bacalp7) was detected initially at exponential phase and reached a maximum activity of 25,600 au/ml in the early stationary phase, whereas bacteriocin production by p. pentosaceus alp57 (bacalp57) reached the maximum at exponential phase with 12,800 au/ml. the bacteriocins did not kill l. monocytogenes esb54 nor l. innocua 2030c however, cellular growth was reduced. the partially purified bacteriocins, bacalp7 and bacalp57, were below 6.5 kda in size as determined by tricine-sds gel electrophoresis. e. faecium and p. pentosaceus contained dna fragments corresponding in size to those recorded for enterocin b and pediocin pa-1, respectively. sequencing of the fragments from both bacteriocins confirmed the homology. to our knowledge, for the first time two lab producing bacteriocins similar to pediocin pa-1 and enterocin b, were isolated from non-fermented shellfish. the adaptation of the cultures to seafood matrices may be advantageous in terms of application as a biopreservation strategy for reduction of l. monocytogenes levels in seafood products.

TI  == characterization of mesentericin st99, a bacteriocin produced by leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum st99 isolated from boza.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria isolated from boza, a cereal-fermented beverage from belogratchik, bulgaria, were screened for the production of bacteriocins. with the first screening, 13 of the 52 isolates inhibited the growth of listeria innocua and lactobacillus plantarum. the cell-free supernatant of one of these strains, classified as leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum st99, inhibited the growth of bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, several lactobacillus spp., lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus thermophilus. clostridium spp., carnobacterium spp., l. mesenteroides and gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited. maximum antimicrobial activity, i.e. 6,400 arbitrary units (au)/ml, was recorded in mrs broth after 24 h at 30 degrees c. incubation in the presence of protease iv and pronase e resulted in loss of antimicrobial activity, confirming that growth inhibition was caused by a bacteriocin, designated here as mesentericin st99. no  loss in activity was recorded after treatment with alpha-amylase, sds, tween 20,  tween 80, urea, triton x-100, n-laurylsarcosin, edta and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. mesentericin st99 remained active after 30 min at 121 degrees c and after 2 h of incubation at ph 2 to 12. metabolically active cells of l. innocua treated with mesentericin st99 did not undergo lysis. mesentericin st99 did not adhere to the cell surface of strain st99. precipitation with ammonium sulfate (70% saturation), followed by sep-pack c18 chromatography and reverse-phase hplc on a c18 nucleosil column yielded one antimicrobial peptide.

TI  == a pcr-based method for identification of lactobacilli at the genus level.
AB  == we developed a polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based method for the identification of lactobacilli at the genus level. one specific primer, lblma1-rev, was designed by analysing similarities between the nucleotide sequence of the spacer between the 16s and 23s rrna genes in a number of lactobacillus strains. amplification with lblma1-rev and r16-1, a universal primer, generated a pcr product for 23 lactobacillus species. electrophoresis did not reveal any discrete bands when escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, streptococcus thermophilus, carnobacterium pissicola,  pediococcus pentosaceus, bifidobacterium bifidum, weissella confusa, enterococcus hirae, staphylococcus aureus or listeria monocytogenes dna were used as template.

TI  == production of bacteriocin-like metabolites by lactic acid cultures isolated from  sucuk samples.
AB  == a total of 51 sucuk samples, obtained from different regions of turkey, were examined for lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains producing putative bacteriocin-like metabolites. for detection of antagonistic activity, agar spot and well diffusion assay tests were used. lactobacillus sake lb790, listeria monocytogenes li6, staphylococcus aureus st44 and escherichia coli nrrl b-3704 were used as indicator organisms. strains having antimicrobial activity were also tested against clostridium perfringens 4ttk, clostridium botulinum type a. 7948,  bacillus cereus nrrl b-3711, micrococcus luteus nrrl b-4376 and yersinia enterocolitica type 103. 57 of 424 isolates from sucuk samples were putative producers of bacteriocin-like metabolistes and were identified as the following:  19 lactobacillus plantarum, 4 l. curvatus, 4 pediococcus pentosaceus, 3 p. acidilactici, 2 l. pentosus, 2 l. sake, 1 l. delbrueckii, 1 l. rhamnosus and 21 unidentified lactobacillus spp. p. pentosaceus 416, p. acidilactici 413, 419 and  446, l. curvatus 348, l. plantarum 452 and 495, and lactobacillus spp. 411 strains have the best potential for use as sucuk starter cultures.

TI  == molecular characterization of the replicon of the pediococcus pentosaceus 43200 pediocin a plasmid pmd136.
AB  == the pediocin a-encoding plasmid of pediococcus pentosaceus 43200, pmd136, was characterized by restriction enzyme analysis. analysis of its replicon was facilitated by the construction of a probe vector consisting of the escherichia coli plasmid psp72 and the cat gene from staphylococcus aureus plasmid pc194. the replication region of pmd136 was localized on a 1.6-kb ecori/bglii fragment. sequencing analysis revealed a non-coding region, repa, spanning the first 440 bp, followed by an open reading frame, repb, encoding a putative protein of 390 amino acids. the non-coding region contained two sets of 6-bp and two sets of 22-bp direct repeats and two sets of inverted repeats upstream of the open reading frame. strong homology of the isolated replicon was found to theta-type replicons of lactococcus lactis plasmids. segregational stability assay suggested at least two regions as potentially involved in the stabilization of pmd136. the  plasmid's strong homology to other theta-type replicons and its relatively high stability suggest that pmd136 belongs to the widespread family of theta-replication plasmids.

TI  == effect of three commercial starters on growth of staphylococcus aureus and enterotoxins (a-d) and thermonuclease production in broth.
AB  == the growth of four enterotoxigenic staphylococcus aureus strains was partially inhibited by three commercial starters used in the meat sausage industry when grown in apt broth at 30 degrees c statically. starter sp318 (a mixture of selected strains of lactobacillus sake, pediococcus pentosaceus and staphylococcus xylosus) showed the most inhibitory activity. staphylococcal enterotoxins (a, b, c1 and d) synthesis was totally inhibited by the growth of the three starters, whereas staphylococcal thermonuclease production was partially inhibited in mixed cultures.

TI  == effect of chitosan in meat preservation.
AB  == the effect of chitosan in meat preservation, including microbiological, chemical, sensory and color qualities, was examined. in liquid medium, chitosan (0.01%) inhibited the growth of some spoilage bacteria such as bacillus subtilis ifo 3025, escherichia coli rb, pseudomonas fragi ifo 3458 and staphylococcus aureus iam 1011. at higher concentrations (0.1 and 1.0%) it inhibited the growth of the  meat starter cultures, lactobacillus plantarium iam 1216, pediococcus pentosaceus iam 12296 and micrococcus varians ifo 3765. in meat, during incubation at 30 degrees c for 48 h or storage at 4 degrees c for 10 days, 0.5-1.0% chitosan inhibited the growth of spoilage bacteria, reduced lipid oxidation and putrefaction, and resulted in better sensory attributes. chitosan also had a good effect on the development of the red color of meat during storage.

TI  == the occurrence and growth of microorganisms during the fermentation of fish sausage.
AB  == minced fish (mullet) sausage mixes containing added sugar, salt, nitrate, nitrite and spices were fermented (48 h, 30 degrees c) by indigenous flora or by a starter culture (pediococcus acidilactici) and the microbial ecology and behaviour of various bacteria was monitored. pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus plantarum dominated the indigenous fermentation, achieving populations of 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g by 48 h, and decreasing the ph of the mix to 4.5-4.7. significant growth (10(5)-10(7) cfu/g) of staphylococcus warneri, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis. micrococcus varians and micrococcus luteus also occurred during this fermentation. less growth was exhibited by bacillus megaterium and yeasts. pediococcus acidilactici dominated the fermentation when it was inoculated as a starter culture, but indigenous lactic acid bacteria (p. pentosaceus and l. plantarum) also grew to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g. the growth of other bacteria and yeasts was restricted during fermentation with starter culture. inoculated escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella sofia, and staphylococcus aureus grew to 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g in the sausage mix during indigenous fermentation. lesser growth occurred for bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and vibrio parahaemolyticus. growth of these bacteria was significantly inhibited in sausage mix fermented with p. acidilactici.
