TI  == radiation resistance of lactobacilli isolated from radurized meat relative to growth and environment.
AB  == of 113 lactobacilli isolated from radurized (5 kgy) minced meat, 7 lactobacillus  sake strains, 1 l. curvatus strain, and 1 l. farciminis strain were used for radiation resistance studies in a semisynthetic substrate (i.e., modified mrs broth). five reference lactobacillus spp., one staphylococcus aureus strain, and  one salmonella typhimurium strain were used for comparative purposes. all l. sake isolates exhibited the phenomenon of being more resistant to gamma-irradiation in the exponential (log) phase than in the stationary phase of their growth cycles by a factor of 28%. four references strains also exhibited this phenomenon, with  l. sake (dsm 20017) showing a 68% increase in resistance in the log phase over the stationary phase. this phenomenon was not common to all bacteria tested and is not common to all strains with high radiation resistance. four l. sake isolates and three reference strains were used in radiation sensitivity testing in a natural food system (i.e., meat). the bacteria were irradiated in minced meat and packaged under four different conditions (air, vacuum, co2, and n2). organisms exhibited the highest death rate (lowest d10 values [doses required to  reduce the logarithm of the bacterial population by 1] ) under co2 packaging conditions, but resistance to irradiation was increased under n2. the d10 values  of the isolates were generally greater than those of the reference strains. the d10 values were also higher (approximately two times) in meat than in semisynthetic growth medium.
