TI  == modeling and structural analysis of cellulases using clostridium thermocellum as  template.
AB  == cellulase is one of the most widely distributed enzymes with wide application. they are involved in conversion of biomass into simpler sugars. cellulase of trichoderma longibrachiatum, a known cellulolytic fungus was compared with clostridium thermocellum [aaa23226.1] cellulase. blastp was performed with aaa23226.1 as query sequence to obtain nine similar sequences from ncbi protein data bank. the physicochemical properties of cellulase were analyzed using expasy's protparam tool namely protparam, sopma and gor iv. homology modeling was done using swiss model and checked quality by rmsd values using vmd1.9.1. active  sites of each model were predicted using automated active site prediction server  of scfbio. study revealed instability of cellulase of two eukaryotic strains namely trichoderma longibrachiatum [caa43059.1] and melanocarpus albomyces [cad56665.1]. the negative gravy score value of cellulases ensured better interaction and activity in aqueous phase. it was found that molecular weight (m. wt) ranges between 25-127.56 kda. iso-electric point (pi) of cellulases was found to be acidic in nature. gor iv and sopma were used to predict secondary structure of cellulase, which showed that random coil, was dominated. neighbor joining tree with c. thermocellum [aaa23226.1] cellulase as root showed that cellulases of thermoaerobacter subterraneus [zp_07835928] and c. thermocellum [caa4305.1] were  more similar to eukaryotic cellulases supported by least boot strap values. pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis cellulase was found to be the ideal model supported by least rmsd score among the predicted structures. trichoderma longibrachiatum cellulase was found to be the best compared to other cellulases,  which possess high number of active sites with asn and thr rich active sites. cys residues were also present ensuring stable interaction and better bonding. hydrophilic residues were found high in active sites of all analyzed models and template.

TI  == crystal structure of hyperthermophilic endo-beta-1,4-glucanase: implications for  catalytic mechanism and thermostability.
AB  == endo-beta-1,4-glucanase from thermophilic fervidobacterium nodosum rt17-b1 (fncel5a), a new member of glycosyl hydrolase family 5, is highly thermostable and exhibits the highest activity on carboxymethylcellulose among the reported homologues. to understand the structural basis for the thermostability and catalytic mechanism, we report here the crystal structures of fncel5a and the complex with glucose at atomic resolution. fncel5a exhibited a (beta/alpha)(8)-barrel structure typical of clan gh-a of the glycoside hydrolase  families with a large and deep catalytic pocket located in the c-terminal end of  the beta-strands that may permit substrate access. a comparison of the structure  of fncel5a with related structures from thermopile clostridium thermocellum, mesophile clostridium cellulolyticum, and psychrophile pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis showed significant differences in intramolecular interactions (salt  bridges and hydrogen bonds) that may account for the difference in their thermostabilities. the substrate complex structure in combination with a mutagenesis analysis of the catalytic residues implicates a distinctive catalytic module glu(167)-his(226)-glu(283), which suggests that the histidine may function as an intermediate for the electron transfer network between the typical glu-glu  catalytic module. further investigation suggested that the aromatic residues trp(61), trp(204), phe(231), and trp(240) as well as polar residues asn(51), his(127), tyr(228), and his(235) in the active site not only participated in substrate binding but also provided a unique microenvironment suitable for catalysis. these results provide substantial insight into the unique characteristics of fncel5a for catalysis and adaptation to extreme temperature.
