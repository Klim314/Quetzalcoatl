TI == pyocycanin, a contributory factor in haem acquisition and virulence enhancement of porphyromonas gingivalis in the lung.
AB == several recent studies show that the lungs infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa are often co-colonised by oral bacteria including black-pigmenting anaerobic (bpa) porphyromonas species. the bpas have an absolute haem requirement and their presence in the infected lung indicates that sufficient haem, a virulence up-regulator in bpas, must be present to support growth. haemoglobin from micro-bleeds occurring during infection is the most likely source of haem in the lung. porphyromonas gingivalis displays a novel haem acquisition paradigm whereby haemoglobin must be firstly oxidised to methaemoglobin, facilitating haem release, either by gingipain proteolysis or capture via the haem-binding haemophore hmuy. p. aeruginosa produces the blue phenazine redox compound, pyocyanin. since phenazines can oxidise haemoglobin, it follows that pyocyanin may also facilitate haem acquisition by promoting methaemoglobin production. here we show that pyocyanin at concentrations found in the cf lung during p. aeruginosa infections rapidly oxidises oxyhaemoglobin in a dose-dependent manner. we demonstrate that methaemoglobin formed by pyocyanin is also susceptible to proteolysis by p. gingivalis kgp gingipain and neutrophil elastase, thus releasing haem. importantly, co-incubation of oxyhaemoglobin with pyocyanin facilitates haem pickup from the resulting methemoglobin by the p. gingivalis hmuy haemophore. mice intra-tracheally challenged with viable p. gingivalis cells plus pyocyanin displayed increased mortality compared to those administered p. gingivalis alone. pyocyanin significantly elevated both methaemoglobin and total haem levels in homogenates of mouse lungs and increased the level of arginine-specific gingipain activity from mice inoculated with viable p. gingivalis cells plus pyocyanin compared with mice inoculated with p. gingivalis only. these findings indicate that pyocyanin, by promoting haem availability through methaemoglobin formation and stimulating of gingipain production, may contribute to virulence of p. gingivalis and disease severity when co-infecting with p. aeruginosa in the lung.

TI == scratching the surface - tobacco-induced bacterial biofilms.
AB == individual environmental factors, such as iron, temperature and oxygen, are known to have a profound effect on bacterial phenotype. therefore, it is surprising so little known is about the influence of chemically complex cigarette smoke on bacterial physiology. recent evidence has demonstrated that tobacco smoke and components alter the bacterial surface and promote biofilm formation in several important human pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, klebsiella pneumonia, porphyromonas gingivalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and the relevance to increased susceptibility to infectious disease in smokers and to treatment are reviewed.

TI == antimicrobial activity and mechanism of action of a novel cationic alpha-helical  octadecapeptide derived from alpha-amylase of rice.
AB == amyi-1-18, an octadecapeptide derived from alpha-amylase (amyi-1) of rice (oryza  sativa l. japonica), is a novel cationic alpha-helical antimicrobial peptide (amp) that contains two lysine and two arginine residues. the antimicrobial activity of amyi-1-18 against human pathogens was quantitatively evaluated using a chemiluminescence method that measures atp derived from viable cells. of the ten kinds of human pathogens, amyi-1-18 exhibited antimicrobial activity against nine. its 50% growth-inhibitory concentrations (ics50 ) against porphyromonas gingivalis, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, and streptococcus mutans were 13, 19, 50, 64, and 77 mum, respectively. amyi-1-18 had little or no hemolytic activity even at 500 mum, and showed negligible cytotoxicity up to 1200 mum. the degree of 3,3'-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide release from p. gingivalis cells induced by the addition of amyi-1-18 was significantly lower than that induced by the addition of melittin. flow cytometric analysis showed that the percentages of p. aeruginosa, s. mutans, and c. albicans cells stained with propidium iodide (pi), a dna-intercalating dye, were 89%, 43%, and 3%, respectively, when amyi-1-18 was added at a concentration equal to its 4xic50 . therefore, the antimicrobial activity of amyi-1-18 against p. aeruginosa and s. mutans appears to be mainly attributable to its membrane-disrupting activity. in contrast, its antimicrobial activity against p. gingivalis and c. albicans most likely depends upon interactions with intracellular targets other than their cell membranes. collectively, these results indicate that amyi-1-18 is useful as a safe and potent amp against the pathogens described above in many fields of healthcare.

TI == identification and characterization of an anti-pseudomonal dichlorocarbazol derivative displaying anti-biofilm activity.
AB == pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant towards all currently available antibiotics are increasingly encountered, raising the need for new anti-pseudomonal drugs. we therefore conducted a medium-throughput screen of a small-molecule collection resulting in the identification of the n-alkylated 3,6-dihalogenocarbazol 1-(sec-butylamino)-3-(3,6-dichloro-9h-carbazol-9-yl)propan-2-ol (mic = 18.5 mug ml(-)(1)). this compound, compound 1, is bacteriostatic towards a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, including p. aeruginosa. importantly, 1 also eradicates mature biofilms of p. aeruginosa. 1 displays no cytotoxicity against various human cell types, pointing to its potential for further development as a novel antibacterial drug.

TI == antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties of pgla-am1, cpf-am1, and magainin-am1: potent activity against oral pathogens.
AB == cationic amphipathic alpha-helical peptides are intensively studied classes of host defence peptides (hdps). three peptides, peptide glycine-leucine-amide (pgla-am1), caerulein-precursor fragment (cpf-am1) and magainin-am1, originally isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the african volcano frog xenopus amieti (pipidae), were studied for their antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities against oral and respiratory pathogens. minimal effective concentrations (mecs), determined by radial diffusion assay, were generally lower than minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) determined by microbroth dilution. pgla-am1 and cpf-am1 were particularly active against streptococcus mutans and all three peptides were effective against fusobacterium nucleatum, whereas enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans proved to be relatively resistant micro-organisms. a type strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa was shown to be more susceptible than the clinical isolate studied. pgla-am1 displayed the greatest propensity to bind lipopolysaccharide (lps) from escherichia coli, p. aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. all three peptides showed less binding to p. gingivalis lps than to lps from the other species studied. oral fibroblast viability was unaffected by 50 mum peptide treatments. production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine il-8 by oral fibroblasts was significantly increased following treatment with 1 or 10 mum magainin-am1 but not following treatment with pgla-am1 or cpf-am1. in conclusion, as well as possessing potent antimicrobial actions, the x. amieti peptides bound to lps from three human pathogens and had no effect on oral fibroblast viability. cpf-am1 and pgla-am1 show promise as templates for the design of novel analogues for the treatment of oral and dental diseases associated with bacteria or fungi.

TI == susceptibility of methacrylate-based root canal filling to degradation by bacteria found in endodontic infections.
AB == objectives: to present a case of endodontic failure obturated with a methacrylate-based root filling material, resilon/realseal (rs). to determine if rs is susceptible to biodegradation by endodontically relevant microbes by a method known to show rs degradation. method and materials: emulsions of rs were dispersed in agar with minimal bacterial nutrients in culture plates. lipase ps served as a positive control. pseudomonas aeruginosa, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis were tested for their ability to biodegrade rs. the bacteria were inoculated in the plates and examined daily for rs degradation for 7 days. results: degradation of the emulsified rs manifested in the formation of clear zones around p aeruginosa, p intermedia, p asaccharolytica, s aureus, and s epidermidis. no degradation was seen with the other tested bacteria or in plates that did not contain rs emulsion. conclusion: endodontic pathogenic bacteria can degrade rs. these findings complement other work and suggest that the seal and integrity of root canal fillings obturated with rs may be impaired by a microbial insult.

TI == actin enables the antimicrobial action of ll-37 peptide in the presence of microbial proteases.
AB == host defense peptides play an important host-protective role by their microcidal  action, immunomodulatory functions, and tissue repair activities. proteolysis is a common strategy of pathogens used to neutralize host defense peptides. here, we show that actin, the most abundant structural protein in eukaryotes, binds the ll-37 host defense peptide, protects it from degradation by the proteases of pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis, and enables its antimicrobial activity despite the presence of the proteases. co-localization of ll-37 with extracellular actin was observed in necrotized regions of samples from oral lesions. competition assays, cross-linking experiments, limited proteolysis, and mass spectrometry revealed that ll-37 binds by specific hydrophobic interactions to the his-40-lys-50 segment of actin, located in the dnase i binding loop. the integrity of the binding site of both ll-37 and actin is a prerequisite to the binding. our results demonstrate that actin, presumably released by dead cells and abundant in infected sites, might be utilized by the immune system to enhance spatio-temporal immunity in an attempt to arrest infection and control inflammation.

TI == involvement of the wbp pathway in the biosynthesis of porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide with anionic polysaccharide.
AB == the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis has two different lipopolysaccharide (lps) molecules, o-lps and a-lps. we have recently shown that p. gingivalis strain hg66 lacks a-lps. here, we found that introduction of a wild-type wbpb gene into strain hg66 restored formation of a-lps. sequencing of the wbpb gene from strain hg66 revealed the presence of a nonsense mutation in the gene. the wbpb gene product is a member of the wbp pathway, which plays a role in the synthesis of udp-mannac(3nac)a in pseudomonas aeruginosa; udp-mannac(3nac)a is sequentially synthesized by the wbpa, wbpb, wbpe, wbpd and wbpi proteins. we then determined the effect of the pgn_0002 gene, a wbpd homolog, on the biosynthesis of a-lps. a pgn_0002-deficient mutant demonstrated an a-lps biosynthesis deficiency. taken together with previous studies, the present results suggest that the final product synthesized by the wbp pathway is one of the sugar substrates necessary for the biosynthesis of a-lps.

TI == assessment of periodontal and opportunistic flora in patients with peri-implantitis.
AB == aim: to assess the presence of periodontal and opportunistic organisms in patients with peri-implantitis. material and methods: thirty-three partially edentulous subjects (22 women, 11 men), aged 32-90 years, who had one or more implants with peri-implantitis were included. peri-implantitis was defined as: (i) the presence of bleeding on probing and/or suppuration and (ii) radiographic images showed marginal bone loss >1.8 mm after 1 year in function. criteria for inclusion were: (i) partially edentulous patients having at least one implant diagnosed with peri-implantitis; (ii) no antibiotic therapy for 6 months prior to clinical examination. following this definition, a total of 48 implants were diagnosed with peri-implantitis. subgingival bacterial samples were obtained with sterile paper points from infected implants and selected teeth of each individual. periodontopathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) were detected by multiplex pcr targeting 16s rdna. samples were placed in reduced transport medium and cultured for opportunistic pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, enteric bacteria, pseudomonas and yeasts). results: twenty-two patients yielded positive results for p. gingivalis, 25 for t. forsythia, eight for p. intermedia and 13 for t. denticola. none of the patients yielded a positive result for a. actinomycetemcomitans. non-periodontal species were found in five patients (15% of total). p. aeruginosa was found in four (12%) patients, and c. albicans (3%) and s. aureus in one patient (3%) each. in two cases of peri-implantitis, none of the periodontal or opportunistic microorganisms studied were detected in either implant or tooth samples. when results of the periodontopathic bacteria from the implant and tooth samples of the same patient were compared, 18 patients (54%) showed the same results for both samples and 15 (45%) patients different results. conclusions: the implant surface may be colonized with pathogens different from periodontal bacteria. opportunistic pathogens such as p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and c. albicans may be associated with implant failure.

TI == 16s rdna-based metagenomic analysis of dental plaque and lung bacteria in patients with severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB == background and objective: acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ae-copd) are leading causes of mortality in hospital intensive care units. we sought to determine whether dental plaque biofilms might harbor pathogenic bacteria that can eventually cause lung infections in patients with severe ae-copd. material and methods: paired samples of subgingival plaque biofilm and tracheal aspirate were collected from 53 patients with severe ae-copd. total bacterial dna was extracted from each sample individually for polymerase chain reaction amplification and/or generation of bacterial 16s rdna sequences and cdna libraries. we used a metagenomic approach, based on bacterial 16s rdna sequences, to compare the distribution of species present in dental plaque and lung. results: analysis of 1060 sequences (20 clones per patient) revealed a wide range of aerobic, anaerobic, pathogenic, opportunistic, novel and uncultivable bacterial species. species indistinguishable between the paired subgingival plaque and tracheal aspirate samples (97-100% similarity in 16s rdna sequence) were dental plaque pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) and lung pathogens (acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae). real-time polymerase chain reaction of 16s rdna indicated lower levels of pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis colonizing the dental plaques compared with the paired tracheal aspirate samples. conclusion: these results support the hypothesis that dental bacteria may contribute to the pathology of severe ae-copd.

TI == porphyromonas gingivalis modulates pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced apoptosis of respiratory epithelial cells through the stat3 signaling pathway.
AB == pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic bacterial pathogen, causing  infections of respiratory and other organ systems in immunocompromised hosts that may invade and proliferate in mucosal epithelial cells to induce apoptosis. previous studies suggest that oral bacteria, especially gram-negative periodontal pathogens, may enhance p. aeruginosa invasion into respiratory epithelial cells to augment tissue destruction. in this study, we investigated the effect of the periodontopathogen porphyromonas gingivalis on p. aeruginosa-induced epithelial cell apoptosis. p. gingivalis invasion transiently inhibited p. aeruginosa-induced apoptosis in respiratory epithelial cells via the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3) signaling pathway. the activated stat3 up-regulated the downstream anti-apoptotic moleculars survivin and b-cell leukemia-2 (bcl-2). this process was accompanied by down-regulation of pro-apoptosis molecular bcl-2-associated death promoter (bad) and caspase-3 activity inhibition. in addition, the activation of the stat3 pathway was affected by p. gingivalis in a dose-dependent manner. finally, co-invasion of p. aeruginosa and p. gingivalis led to greater cell death compared with p. aeruginosa challenge alone. these results suggest that regulation of p. aeruginosa-induced apoptosis by p. gingivalis contributes to the pathogenesis of respiratory disease. interference with this process may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment and prevention of respiratory disease.

TI == evaluation of a d-amino-acid-containing fluorescence resonance energy transfer peptide library for profiling prokaryotic proteases.
AB == bacterial proteases play an important role in a broad spectrum of processes, including colonization, proliferation, and virulence. in this respect, bacterial proteases are potential biomarkers for bacterial diagnosis and targets for novel therapeutic protease inhibitors. to investigate these potential functions, the authors designed and used a protease substrate fluorescence resonance energy transfer (fret) library comprising 115 short d- and l-amino-acid-containing fluorogenic substrates as a tool to generate proteolytic profiles for a wide range of bacteria. bacterial specificity of the d-amino acid substrates was confirmed using enzymes isolated from both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. interestingly, bacterial proteases that are known to be involved in housekeeping and nutrition, but not in virulence, were able to degrade substrates in which a d-amino acid was present. using our fret peptide library and culture supernatants from a total of 60 different bacterial species revealed novel, bacteria-specific, proteolytic profiles, although in-species variation was observed for pseudomonas aeruginosa, porphyromonas gingivalis, and staphylococcus aureus. overall, the specific characteristic of our substrate peptide library makes it a rapid tool to high-throughput screen for novel substrates to detect bacterial proteolytic activity.

AB == a novel papain inhibitory protein (spi) from streptomyces mobaraensis was studied to measure its inhibitory effect on bacterial cysteine protease activity (staphylococcus aureus sspb) and culture supernatants (porphyromonas gingivalis, bacillus anthracis). further, growth of bacillus anthracis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio cholerae was completely inhibited by 10 mum spi. at this concentration of spi, no cytotoxicity was observed. we conclude that spi inhibits bacterial virulence factors and has the potential to become a novel therapeutic treatment against a range of unrelated pathogenic bacteria.

AB == objectives: this study aims to assess the effects of rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse with or without adjunct tongue scraping on volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) in breath air, and the microbiota at the dorsum of the tongue. material and methods: a randomized single-masked controlled clinical trial with a cross-over study design over 14 days including 21 subjects was performed. bacterial samples from the dorsum of the tongue were assayed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: no halitosis (identified by vsc assessments) at day 14 was identified in 12/21 subjects with active rinse alone, in 10/21 with adjunct use of tongue scraper, in 1/21 for negative control rinse alone, and in 3/21 in the control and tongue scraping sequence. at day 14, significantly lower counts were identified only in the active rinse sequence (p < 0.001) for 15/78 species including, fusobacterium sp., porphyromonas gingivalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and tannerella forsythia. a decrease in bacteria from baseline to day 14 was found in successfully treated subjects for 9/74 species including: p. gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica, s. aureus, and treponema denticola. baseline vsc scores were correlated with several bacterial species. the use of a tongue scraper combined with active rinse did not change the levels of vsc compared to rinsing alone. conclusions: vsc scores were not associated with bacterial counts in samples taken from the dorsum of the tongue. the active rinse alone containing zinc and chlorhexidine had effects on intra-oral halitosis and reduced bacterial counts of species associated with malodor. tongue scraping provided no beneficial effects on the microbiota studied. clinical relevance: periodontally healthy subjects with intra-oral halitosis benefit from daily rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse.

TI == lysine substitutions convert a bacterial-agglutinating peptide into a bactericidal peptide that retains anti-lipopolysaccharide activity and low hemolytic activity.
AB == gl13nh2 is a bacteria-agglutinating peptide derived from the sequence of the salivary protein parotid secretory protein (psp, bpifa2, splunc2, c20orf70). the peptide agglutinates both gram negative and gram positive bacteria, and shows anti-lipopolysaccharide activity in vitro and in vivo. however, gl13nh2 does not exhibit bactericidal activity. to generate a more cationic peptide with potential bactericidal activity, three amino acid residues were replaced with lysine residues to generate the peptide gl13k. in this report, the antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities of gl13k were characterized. gl13k had lost the ability to agglutinate bacteria but gained bactericidal activity. substitution of individual amino acids in gl13k with alanine did not restore bacterial agglutination. gl13k was bactericidal against pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus gordonii and escherichia coli but not porphyromonas gingivalis. unlike the agglutinating activity of gl13nh2, the bactericidal activity of gl13k against p. aeruginosa was retained in the presence of saliva. both gl13nh2 and gl13k exhibited anti-lipopolysaccharide activity. in gl13k, this activity appeared to depend on a serine hydroxyl group. gl13k protected mice from lipopolysaccharide-induced sepsis and the peptide exhibited a low level of hemolysis, suggesting that it may be suitable for in vivo application.

AB == objectives: to explore the short-term effects from toothbrushing, tongue cleaning with sponge brush and wiping on oral mucous membrane by chlorhexidine. background: numerous reports have been seen in recent years proving the effectiveness of mouth cleaning with a toothbrush for the prevention of respiratory infections among the dependent elderly. however, the short-term effects from each oral care method have not yet been clarified. hence, an investigation was conducted by having each subject independently perform various oral care methods for five consecutive days. materials and methods: the subjects consisted of 12 assistance-dependent elderly who have difficulties with tooth brushing by themselves, have 10 or more residual teeth and are not yet using plate dentures. after the pre-intervention examination, each of the following oral care methods were performed on the same subject on an approximately three week basis: 1) tooth brushing 2) tongue cleaning with sponge brush 3) wiping on oral mucous with sponge brush by chlorhexidine. each method was performed independently, once a day for 5 consecutive days and the subjects were reexamined on the sixth day for comparative verification. results: consequently, toothbrushing decreased the plaque index and gingival index significantly and an improvement of oral malodour was also acknowledged (p < 0.01). tongue cleaning with a sponge brush decreased the tongue coat score significantly (p < 0.05) and oral malodour was also improved (p < 0.01). wiping on oral mucous with a sponge brush soaked in chlorhexidine significantly decreased opportunistic infections in the pharynx region (p < 0.05). conclusions: it was suggested that the use of not only a toothbrush but also chlorhexidine gluconate may be indicated for dependent elderly people in whom pathogens of opportunistic infection are detected.

TI == effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic species--an in vitro study.
AB == the in vitro study was aimed to determine the effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic microorganisms. ozone was generated for 6 s-2 x 24 s (corresponding to 0.56 mg-2 x 2.24 mg of ozone) against 23 mainly anaerobic periodontopathogenic species. agar diffusion test was used as a screening method. then, the killing activity was tested in a serum-free environment and with 25% v/v inactivated serum. further, the effect of ozone on bactericidal activity of native serum was analyzed against fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. agar diffusion test showed a high efficacy of ozone against microorganisms, especially against porphyromonas gingivalis. this result was confirmed by the killing tests; most of the strains in a concentration of 10(5) were completely eliminated after twofold 18-s application of ozone. only four of the six potentially "superinfecting" species (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, candida albicans) survived in part. addition of heat-inactivated serum reduced the killing rate of ozone by 78% after 6-s and by 47% after twofold 18-s exposures; no strain was completely eradicated after any application of ozone. the bactericidal effect of native serum was enhanced after application of ozone; no effect was visible on the included a. actinomycetemcomitans strain which was found to be completely resistant to the bactericidal action of serum. in conclusion, (a) ozone has a strong antibacterial activity against putative periodontopathogenic microorganisms, and (b) the bactericidal effect is reduced in the presence of serum. ozone may have potential as an adjunctive application to mechanical treatment in periodontitis patients.

AB == three kinds of interactions occur between ginseng botanicals and microorganisms:  a) spoilage of the botanical by various fungi (e.g., aspergillus, penicillium, alternaria, and eurotium species) and bacteria; b) transformation of ginsenosides into more bioactive forms by bacteria such as intrasporangium sp. gs603, microbacterium sp. gs514, caulobacter leidyia, bifidobacterium sp. int57, bifidobacterium sp. sj32, fusobacterium sp. and bacteroides sp., and moulds (e.g., aspergillus niger, fusarium sacchari, paecilomyces bainier sp. 229, rhizopus stolonifer, myrothecium verrucaria and acremonium strictum); and c) inhibition of certain bacteria (propionibacterium acnes, porphyromonas gingivalis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa), fungi (candida albicans, aspergillus fumigatus, fusarium oxysporum) and viruses by ginseng constituents.

TI == mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB == the oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. when this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. the mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the streptococcus (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis) and staphylococcus (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. in addition, some members of both the streptococcus and the staphylococcus genera, as well as porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. the current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. the pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.

TI == antimicrobial susceptibility of moxifloxacin against gram-negative enteric rods from colombian patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB == background: gram-negative enteric rods were associated with periodontal diseases  in several populations. the association between enteric and putative periodontal pathogens has received little attention in the literature. the present investigation determined the occurrence and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates of gram-negative enteric rods from colombian patients with chronic periodontitis. methods: clinical parameters and the in vitro antimicrobial sensitivity of isolates of gram-negative enteric rods were examined in 76 patients with chronic periodontitis in medellin, colombia. subgingival samples were processed using culture and biochemical tests for the detection of periodontal and superinfecting pathogens. selected colonies of gram-negative enteric rods from pure cultures were used to test the susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. chi-square and mann-whitney tests were used to determine differences in clinical variables versus the presence or absence of gram-negative enteric rods. results: klebsiella pneumoniae was found in 12 patients, pseudomonas aeruginosa was found in four patients, and three other species were recovered with a lower prevalence. men (38.75%) tended to harbor more of the studied organisms than women (17.7%) (p = 0.04). gram-negative enteric rods in periodontal pockets correlated positively with the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (respectively, r = 0.66, 0.31, and 0.32; p <0.001). all superinfecting organisms demonstrated a high susceptibility to moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin but exhibited a variable susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. conclusions: this study found high levels of gram-negative enteric rods in patients with chronic periodontitis. moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin appeared capable of eradicating these organisms from periodontal pockets. its good activity against gram-negative enteric rods and periodontopathogens suggests the potential use of moxifloxacin as an adjunctive antibiotic in the treatment of mixed periodontal infections.

TI == effects of n-acyl homoserine lactone analogues on porphyromonas gingivalis biofilm formation.
AB == background and objective: the gram-negative anaerobic rod porphyromonas gingivalis in oral biofilms is a primary etiological agent of periodontal disease. biofilm formation of various gram-negative bacteria is regulated by a quorum-sensing circuit that relies on n-acyl homoserine lactones (hsls). some synthetic n-acyl hsl analogues act as quorum-sensing inhibitors and suppress biofilm formation in pseudomonas aeruginosa. development of chemical control agents against oral biofilms is necessary, because until now, biofilms have been removed only by mechanical debridement. the present study investigated the effect of n-acyl hsl analogues on p. gingivalis biofilm formation, with the aim of developing new drugs that inhibit oral biofilm formation. material and methods: a flow-cell model was used for p. gingivalis biofilm formation. seventeen synthetic n-acyl hsl analogues were quantitatively assessed by spectrophotometry. the effects of three antagonistic compounds against p. gingivalis biofilm formation were further examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy, and investigated for primary attachment using spectrophotometry and phase contrast microscopy. results: ten out of 17 analogues affected p. gingivalis biofilm formation. three out of 10 analogues significantly decreased biofilm-forming cells (p < 0.05), and these biofilm structures were less well formed three-dimensionally. there were no quantitative or qualitative differences in cell attachment between the control and the three analogue-treated groups. conclusion: three synthetic n-acyl hsl analogues inhibited biofilm formation in p. gingivalis. we suggest that these analogues influence the development stage of p. gingivalis biofilm formation.

AB == galectins, a family of animal lectins, are involved not only in development and differentiation but also in immunoregulation and host-pathogen interactions. galectin-3 interacts with lipopolysaccharides in gram-negative bacteria such as escherichia coli, salmonella minnesota and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the present study investigated whether galectin-3 inhibited the cytokine-inducing activity of periodontopathic bacterial lipopolysaccharides using splenocytes derived from mice of different ages. lipopolysaccharides were extracted from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans y4 and porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277, and then purified. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) analysis revealed that galectin-3 adhered to a. actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharides, but not to the lipopolysaccharides of p. gingivalis. splenocytes were prepared from 1- or 7-month-old c57bl/6 mice. either a. actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharides (200 ng ml(-1)) alone or lipopolysaccharides and murine galectin-3 (10 microg ml(-1)) were added to culture solutions, and the release of interleukin-6 (il-6) and interferon-gamma (ifngamma) from splenocytes was measured by elisa after a 17-h incubation. in all mice tested, a. actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide stimulation significantly increased the production of il-6 and ifngamma (p<0.01). murine galectin-3 suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine production in the splenocytes of the 1-month-old mice (p<0.02 for il-6; p<0.05 for ifngamma), but not in the splenocytes of the 7-month-old mice. this suggests that responses change with age.

TI == oral bacteria modulate invasion and induction of apoptosis in hep-2 cells by pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB == pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic bacterial pathogen, causing  infections of the respiratory and other organ systems in susceptible hosts. p. aeruginosa infection is initiated by adhesion to and invasion of mucosal epithelial cells. the failure of host defenses to eliminate p. aeruginosa from mucosal surfaces results in p. aeruginosa proliferation, sometimes followed by overt infection and tissue destruction. there is growing evidence that associates poor oral health and respiratory infection. an in vitro model system for bacterial invasion of respiratory epithelial cells was used to investigate the influence of oral bacteria on p. aeruginosa epithelial cell invasion. oral pathogens including porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans increased invasion of p. aeruginosa into hep-2 cells from one- to threefold. in contrast, non-pathogenic oral bacteria such as actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus gordonii showed no significant influence on p. aeruginosa invasion. p. aeruginosa together with oral bacteria stimulated greater cytokine production from hep-2 cells than did p. aeruginosa alone. p. aeruginosa in combination with periodontal pathogens also increased apoptosis of hep-2 cells and induced elevated caspase-3 activity. these results suggest that oral bacteria, especially periodontal pathogens, may foster p. aeruginosa invasion into respiratory epithelial cells to enhance host cell cytokine release and apoptosis.

TI == surface components of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB == background and objective: research on porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontopathogen, has provided a tremendous amount of information over the last 20 years, which may exceed in part than that on other closely related members in terms of phylogenetic as well as proteomic criteria, including bacteroides fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron as major anaerobic, opportunistic pathogens in the medical field. in this minireview, we focused on recent research findings concerning surface components such as outer membrane proteins and fimbriae, of p. gingivalis. material and methods: elucidation of the surface components in p. gingivalis was especially difficult because outer membrane proteins are tightly bound to lipopolysaccharide and they are resistant to dissociation and separation from each other, even during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, unless samples are appropriately heated. in addition, p. gingivalis is asaccharolytic and therefore a potent proteolytic bacterium, another factor causing difficulty in research. the study of the surface components was carefully carried out considering these unique features in p. gingivalis when compared with other gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. results: separation of outer membrane proteins, and characterization of ompa-like proteins and ragab as major proteins, is described herein. our recent findings on fima and mfa1 fimbriae, two unique appendages in this organism, and on their regulation of expression are also described briefly. conclusion: surface components of p. gingivalis somehow have contact with host tissues and cells because of the outermost cell elements. therefore, such bacterial components are potentially important in the occurrence of periodontal diseases.

AB == changes in the levels of female sex hormones during the menstrual cycle may cause cyclic differences in subgingival bacterial colonization patterns. the purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that hormonal changes in the menstrual cycle cause changes in the oral microbiota. methods: bacterial plaque samples were collected in 20 systemically and periodontally healthy women using no hormonal contraceptives (test group) over a period of 6 weeks. twenty age-matched systemically and periodontally healthy men were assigned to the control group. samples were processed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assay, and 74 species were analyzed. results: no cyclic pattern of bacterial colonization was identified for any of the 74 species studied in women not using hormonal contraceptives. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) (y4) was common at the beginning of menstruation (mean: 32%) and increased during the following 2 weeks (36%) in women (p <0.05). no cyclic differences in bacterial presence were found among the men (p values varied between 0.14 and 0.98). men presented with significantly higher bacterial counts for 40 of 74 species (p <0.001), including staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa but not porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.15) or tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (p = 0.42). conclusions: during a menstruation period, cyclic variation in the subgingival microbiota of periodontally healthy women of child-bearing age who were not using oral hormonal contraceptives could not be confirmed. male control subjects presented with higher levels of many species but also without a cyclic pattern.

TI == two-year outcome with nobel direct implants: a retrospective radiographic and microbiologic study in 10 patients.
AB == introduction: the nobel direct implant (nobel biocare ab, goteborg, sweden) was developed to minimize marginal bone resorption and to result in "soft tissue integration" for an optimized aesthetic outcome. however, conflicting results have been presented in the literature. the aim of this present study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiologic outcomes of nobel direct implants. materials and methods: ten partially edentulous subjects without evidence of active periodontitis (mean age 55 years) received 12 nobel direct implants. implants were loaded with single crowns after a healing period of 3 to 6 months. treatment outcomes were assessed at month 24. routine clinical assessments, intraoral radiographs, and microbiologic samplings were made. histologic analysis of one failing implant and chemical spectroscopy around three unused implants was performed. paired wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for the evaluation of bone loss; otherwise, descriptive analysis was performed. results: implants were functionally loaded after 3 to 6 months. at 2 years, the mean bone loss of remaining implants was 2.0 mm (sd +/- 1.1 mm; range: 0.0-3.4 mm). three out of 12 implants with an early mean bone loss >3 mm were lost. the surviving implants showed increasing bone loss between 6 and 24 months (p = .028). only 3 out of the 12 implants were considered successful and showed bone loss of <1.7 mm after 2 years. high rates of pathogens, including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium spp., porphyromonas gingivalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and tanerella forsythia, were found. chemical spectroscopy revealed, despite the normal signals from ti, o, and c, also peaks of p, f, s, n, and ca. a normal histologic image of osseointegration was observed in the apical part of the retrieved implant. conclusion: radiographic evidence and 25% implant failures are indications of a low success rate. high counts and prevalence of significant pathogens were found at surviving implants. although extensive bone loss had occurred in the coronal part, the apical portion of the implant showed some bone to implant integration.

TI == [periodontitis and cardiovascular disease].
AB == the prevalence of periodontitis and cardiovascular disease (cvd) is high. a mixed infectious biofilm etiology of periodontitis is known but not fully established in cvd. cofactors; smoking habits, stress, ethnicity, genetics, socioeconomics and age contribute to both diseases. the objectives of this report are to summarize factors in regards to cvd and periodontitis that are clinically relevant. the hypothesis behind a relationship between the two conditions can be founded in (i) shared infections etiology, (ii) shared inflammatory response, (iii) epidemiological and case-control studies, and (iv) periodontal studies demonstrating improvements of cvd markers. streptococcus species in the s. mitis group, and s. anginosus group have been identified in periodontitis and are known as pathogens in endocarditis possibly transported from the oral cavity to the heart through bacteremia during dental therapies, and tooth brushing. other periodontal bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and parvimonas micra are beta-lactamase producing and may contribute to antibiotic resistance (extended spectrum beta-lactamases). other bacteria in cvd and periodontitis include staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. chlamydia pneumoniae and p. gingivalis lipopolyysaccharide capsels share homology and induce heat-shock protein activity and a cascade of proinflammatory cytokines. associations between periodontitis and cvd have been presented in many studies when controlling for confounders. other studies have demonstrated that periodontal therapies increase brachial artery flow rate and reduce serum inflammatory cytokine levels. thus, physicians caring for subjects at cvd risk should consult with dentists/periodontists. dentists must improve their medical knowledge and also learn to consult with physicians when treating patients at cvd risk.

AB == the pseudomonas aeruginosa-derived alkaline protease (apra), elastase a (lasa), elastase b (lasb) and protease iv are considered to play an important role in pathogenesis of this organism. although the sequence analysis of p. aeruginosa genome predicts the presence of several genes encoding other potential proteases in the genome, little has been known about the proteases involving in pathogenesis. recently, porphyromonas gingivalis gingipains and serratia marcescens serralysin have been shown to activate protease-activated receptor 2 (par-2), thereby modulating host inflammatory and immune responses. accordingly, we hypothesized that unknown protease(s) from p. aeruginosa would also modulate such responses through pars. in this study, we found that p. aeruginosa produces a novel large exoprotease (lepa) distinct from known proteases such as apra, lasa, lasb and protease iv. sequence analysis of lepa showed a molecular feature of the proteins transported by the two-partner secretion pathway. our results indicated that lepa activates nf-kappab-driven promoter through human par-1, -2 or -4 and cleaves the peptides corresponding to the tethered ligand region of human par-1, -2 and -4 at a specific site with exposure of their tethered ligands. considered together, these results suggest that lepa would require pars to modulate various host responses against bacterial infection.

TI == mechanisms of evasion of complement by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB == the complement system is an important host response to invading bacteria. activation leads to deposition on the bacterial surface of c3b and its' inactivation products and phagocytosis of the opsonised bacteria by host cells. alternatively the entire complement pathway including terminal components c5b-9 may be activated on the cell surface which gives rise to generation and insertion of the membrane attack complex into the bacterial membrane and cell lysis. bacterial resistance to complement may be by enzyme digestion of complement components or by the generation or acquisition from the host of cell surface molecules which allow the organism to adopt host complement control proteins. the involvement of surface polysaccharides can be deduced from the very strong association of resistance with the presence of capsule and extended or modified lps o-antigens in several species. however, in many cases the mechanism is unclear. the proteases of porphyromonas gingivalis breakdown c3 and c5 and prevent the deposition of c3b on the bacterial cell surface. greater deposition of both c3b and c5b-9 occurs in protease deficient mutants but mutants do not show loss of resistance to complement mediated lysis. instead, complement resistance in p. gingivalis is associated with the presence on the cell surface of an anionic branched mannan and appears independent of capsule serotype.

AB == objective: to determine whether non-enterobacterial endotoxins, which are likely  to constitute the majority of the circulating endotoxin pool, may stimulate coronary artery endothelial cell activation. methods and results: interleukin-8 secretion, monocyte adhesion, and e-selectin expression were measured in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvecs) and coronary artery endothelial cells (hcaecs) challenged in vitro with highly purified endotoxins of common host colonisers escherichia coli, porphyromonas gingivalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides fragilis. hcaecs but not huvecs expressed toll-like receptor (tlr)-2 and were responsive to non-enterobacterial endotoxins. transfection of tlr-deficient hek-293 cells with tlr2 or tlr4/md2 revealed that while e. coli endotoxin utilised solely tlr4 to signal, the endotoxins, deglycosylated endotoxins (lipid-a), and whole heat-killed bacteria of the other species stimulated tlr2-but not tlr4-dependent cell-signalling. blockade of tlr2 with neutralizing antibody prevented hcaec activation by non-enterobacterial endotoxins. comparison of each endotoxin with e. coli endotoxin in limulus amoebocyte lysate assay revealed that the non-enterobacterial endotoxins are greatly underestimated by this assay, which has been used in all previous studies to estimate plasma endotoxin concentrations. conclusion: circulating non-enterobacterial endotoxins may be an underestimated contributor to endothelial activation and atherosclerosis in individuals at risk of increased plasma endotoxin burden.

TI == bacteroides species produce vibrio harveyi autoinducer 2-related molecules.
AB == quorum sensing is a density-dependent gene regulation mechanism that has been described in many bacterial species in the last decades. bacteria that use quorum sensing as part of their gene regulation circuits produce molecules called autoinducers that accumulate in the environment and activate target genes in a quorum-dependent way. some specific clues led us to hypothesize that bacteroides species can produce autoinducers and possess a quorum sensing system. first, bacteroides are anaerobic bacteria that are frequently involved in polymicrobial infections. these infections often involve pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, two of the best understood examples of bacteria that employ quorum sensing systems as part of their pathogenesis. also, studies have detected the presence of a quorum sensing gene involved in the production of autoinducers in porphyromonas gingivalis, a species closely related to the bacteroides genus. these and other evidences prompted us to investigate if bacteroides strains could produce autoinducer molecules that could be detected by a vibrio harveyi reporter system. in this paper, we show that supernatants of b. fragilis, b. vulgatus and b. distasonis strains are able to stimulate the v. harveyi quorum sensing system 2. also, we were able to demonstrate that the stimulation detected is due to the production of autoinducer molecules and not the growth of reporter strains after addition of supernatant. moreover, the phenomenon observed does not seem to represent the degradation of repressors possibly present in the culture medium used. we could also amplify bands from some of the strains tested using primers designed to the luxs gene of escherichia coli. altogether, our results show that b. fragilis, b. vulgatus and b. distasonis (but possibly some other species) can produce v. harveyi autoinducer 2-related molecules. however, the role of such molecules in the biology of these organisms remains unknown.

TI == antimicrobial peptides in defence of the oral and respiratory tracts.
AB == antimicrobial peptides (amps) are components of complex host secretions, acting synergistically with other innate defence molecules to combat infection and control resident microbial populations throughout the oral cavity and respiratory tract. amps are directly antimicrobial, bind lipopolysaccharide (lps) and lipoteichoic acid, and are immunomodulatory signals. pathogenic and commensal organisms display a variety of resistance mechanisms, which are related to structure of cell wall components (e.g. lps) and cytoplasmic membranes, and peptide breakdown mechanisms. for example, lps of the amp-resistant cystic fibrosis pathogen burkholderia cepacia is under-phosphorylated and highly substituted with charge-neutralising 4-deoxy-4-aminoarabinose. additionally, host mimicry by addition of phosphorylcholine contributes to resistance in oral and respiratory organisms. porphyromonas gingivalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pathogens produce extracellular and membrane-bound proteases that degrade amps. many of these bacterial properties are environmentally regulated. their modulation in response to host defences and inflammation can result in altered sensitivity to amps, and may additionally change other host-microbe interactions, e.g. binding to toll-like receptors. the diversity and breadth of antimicrobial cover and immunomodulatory function provided by amps is central to the ability of a host to respond to the diverse and highly adaptable organisms colonising oral and respiratory mucosa.

AB == purpose: this study was conducted to evaluate the usefulness of mechanical and chemical prophylactic oral cleansing treatments for reducing potential respiratory pathogens existing in the oral cavity. methods: thirty-two patients scheduled to undergo oral and maxillofacial surgery that required endotracheal anesthesia were randomly allocated to one of the two groups, the oral cleansing group (n = 16) or the noncleansing group (n = 16). culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods were used to detect and enumerate pathogens. oral cleansing was carried out with an electric toothbrush capable of automatically supplying and aspirating povidone-iodine solution before surgery, followed by rinsing twice a day after surgery. cephazolin (3 g x day(-1)) was given to all patients for 5 days after surgery. results: the pcr detection rates of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and porphyromonas gingivalis in gargle samples before treatment were 87.5%, 68.8%, 53.1%, and 40.6%, respectively. oral cleansing reduced the detection rates and numbers of methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus species, s. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae. in contrast, there was no significant reduction of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus species, s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, or p. aeruginosa in subjects who underwent systemic cephazolin administration without oral cleansing. conclusion: the combination of mechanical and chemical oral cleansing resulted in a significant reduction of potential respiratory pathogens in the oral cavity.

TI == monocytes heterozygous for the asp299gly and thr399ile mutations in the toll-like receptor 4 gene show no deficit in lipopolysaccharide signalling.
AB == toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4)-mediated recognition of lipopolysaccharide (lps) is required for efficient recognition of gram-negative bacterial infections. two commonly occurring mutations in the human tlr4 gene (asp299gly and thr399ile) have recently been shown to be associated with blunted physiological responses to inhaled lps, and with increased risk of gram-negative bacteraemia in sepsis patients and reduced risk of atherosclerosis in an italian population. here we show that monocytes from individuals heterozygous for both mutations in the tlr4 gene exhibit no deficit in recognition of lps of escherichia coli, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, yersinia pestis, chlamydia trachomatis, porphyromonas gingivalis, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. we propose that the relatively high frequency of these mutations in the caucasian population may reflect modified responses of carriers to alternative tlr4 agonists.

TI == antibacterial characteristics of newly developed amphiphilic lipids and dna-lipid complexes against bacteria.
AB == the purpose of this study was to investigate the antibacterial activity of newly  developed amphiphilic lipids and dna/lipid complexes against two types of oral bacteria and two types of hospital infection bacteria. nine amphiphilic lipids were quantitatively prepared from the reaction of n-alkyl alcohol, alpha-amino acids, and p-toluenesulfonic acid. nine dna-lipid complexes were prepared by the simple mixing of dna and amphiphilic lipids. the dna-lipid complexes were insoluble in water. the antibacterial activity of lipids and dna-lipid complexes against porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were evaluated by the disk-diffusion method. seven artificial lipids showed antibacterial behavior; in particular, the lipids prepared from n-decyl alcohol and glycine and from n-decyl alcohol and l-alanine showed antibacterial activity against the four bacterial strains used in this study. on the other hand, the lipids of glutamic acid derivatives did not show any antibacterial activity against the four bacteria strains except for the lipid with an n-octyl group. five dna-lipid complexes also had an antibacterial effect. the complex prepared from dna and glycine decyl ester p-toluenesulfonic acid salt exhibited antibacterial activity against the four types of bacteria strains. in this study it was found that lipids and dna-lipid complexes with a mono-decyl group or a mono-dodecyl group have more favorable antibacterial activity.

TI == luxs: its role in central metabolism and the in vitro synthesis of 4-hydroxy-5-methyl-3(2h)-furanone.
AB == many bacteria produce extracellular molecules which function in cell-to-cell communication. one of these molecules, autoinducer 2 (ai-2), was first described as an extracellular signal produced by vibrio harveyi to control luciferase expression. subsequently, a number of bacteria have been shown to possess ai-2 activity in their culture supernatants, and bear the luxs gene product, which is required for ai-2 synthesis. in porphyromonas gingivalis, luxs and pfs, encoding a 5'-methylthioadenosine/s-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase (mta/sah'ase), form an operon, suggesting that s-adenosylhomocysteine (sah) or 5'-methylthioadenosine (mta) serves as a substrate for ai-2 production. cell-free extracts of escherichia coli mg1655, but not dh5alpha (which carries a luxs frame-shift mutation) were capable of generating ai-2 activity upon addition of sah, but not mta. s-ribosyl-homocysteine (rh) derived from sah also served as a substrate in e. coli mg1655 extracts. rh-supplemented cell-free extracts of pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium that lacks luxs, only generated ai-2 activity following the introduction of a plasmid containing the por. gingivalis pfs-luxs operon. in addition, defined in vitro systems consisting of the purified luxs proteins from por. gingivalis, e. coli, neisseria meningitidis or staphylococcus aureus converted rh to homocysteine and a compound that exhibits ai-2 activity.4-hydroxy-5-methyl-3(2h)-furanone was identified by mass spectrometry analysis as a major product formed in this in vitro reaction. in e. coli mg1655, expression of t3sh [the bacteriophage t3 s-adenosylmethionine (sam) hydrolase] significantly reduced ai-2 activity in culture supernatants, suggesting that ai-2 production is limited by the amount of sah produced in sam-dependent transmethylase reactions. the authors suggest that the luxs protein has an important metabolic function in the recycling of sah. they also show that ps. aeruginosa is capable of removing ai-2 activity, implying that this molecule may act as a nutrient. in many bacteria ai-2 may in fact represent not a signal molecule but a metabolite which is released early and metabolized in the later stages of growth.

TI == mouthrinses: a comparative microbiological study.
AB == this study was performed in order to evaluate the efficacy of different mouthrinses whose use is extended in spain. six different antiseptic mouthrinses were studied by means of determination of minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values against klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus mutans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. also in vivo experiments were carried out in volunteers by the use of mouthrinses and evaluation of bacterial populations before and after the treatment. finally, the kinetics of bacterial death was determined. results suggested that the determination of mic values is not a reliable method to evaluate the antibacterial effect of such products. on the other hand those rinsing solutions based on the effect of oxygen, such as those containing carbamide peroxide have a greater efficacy against anaerobic bacteria compared with rinses whose active molecule is a disinfectant. finally, the kinetics of bacterial death demonstrates that the essential oil rinse kills bacteria much faster. all tested mouthrinses were active as antibacterial although those based on oxygen production or essential oils were more active than solutions based on chlorhexidine and triclosan.

TI == antimicrobial activity of honokiol and magnolol isolated from magnolia officinalis.
AB == the antimicrobial activity of honokiol and magnolol, the main constituents of magnolia officinalis was investigated. the antimicrobial activity was assayed by the agar dilution method using brain heart infusion medium and the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) were determined for each compound using a twofold serial dilution assay. the results showed that honokiol and magnolol have a marked antimicrobial effect (mic = 25 microg/ml) against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, micrococcus luteus and bacillus subtilis, but did not show antimicrobial activity (mic > or = 100 microg/ml) for shigella flexneii, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. our results indicate that honokiol and magnolol, although less potent than tetracycline, show a significant antimicrobial activity for periodontal pathogens. hence we suggest that honokiol and magnolol might have the potential to be an adjunct in the treatment of periodontitis.

TI == antimicrobial activity and flow rate of newer and established root canal sealers.
AB == endodontic sealers that possess both optimum flow ability and antimicrobial properties may theoretically assist in the elimination of microorganisms located in confined areas of the root canal system. the antimicrobial effects and the flow rate of the following sealers were investigated and compared: kerr pulp canal sealer ewt, grossman's sealer, thermaseal, sealer 26, ah plus, and sealer plus. the agar diffusion test was used to assess the antimicrobial activity of the sealers. in the flow assay, the sealers were placed between two glass slabs and a weight of 500 g was placed on the top of the glass. the diameters of the formed discs were recorded. all root canal sealers tested showed some antimicrobial activity against most of the microorganisms. there were no significant differences between the materials tested (p > 0.05). all root canal sealers also flowed under the conditions of this study. statistical analysis of the results revealed that ah plus and kerr pulp canal sealer ewt had flow values significantly superior to the other sealers tested (p > 0.05). taken together, these findings suggest that these sealers have the potential to help in the microbial control in the root canal system.

TI == acetyl-coa synthetase from the amitochondriate eukaryote giardia lamblia belongs  to the newly recognized superfamily of acyl-coa synthetases (nucleoside diphosphate-forming).
AB == the gene coding for the acetyl-coa synthetase (adp-forming) from the amitochondriate eukaryote giardia lamblia has been expressed in escherichia coli. the recombinant enzyme exhibited the same substrate specificity as the native enzyme, utilizing acetyl-coa and adenine nucleotides as preferred substrates and less efficiently, propionyl- and succinyl-coa. n- and c-terminal parts of the g. lamblia acetyl-coa synthetase sequence were found to be homologous to the alpha- and beta-subunits, respectively, of succinyl-coa synthetase. sequence analysis of homologous enzymes from various bacteria, archaea, and the eukaryote, plasmodium falciparum, identified conserved features in their organization, which allowed us to delineate a new superfamily of acyl-coa synthetases (nucleoside diphosphate-forming) and its signature motifs. the representatives of this new superfamily of thiokinases vary in their domain arrangement, some consisting of separate alpha- and beta-subunits and others comprising fusion proteins in alpha-beta or beta-alpha orientation. the presence of homologs of acetyl-coa synthetase (adp-forming) in such human pathogens as g. lamblia, yersinia pestis, bordetella pertussis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, vibrio cholerae, salmonella typhi, porphyromonas gingivalis, and the malaria agent p. falciparum suggests that they might be used as potential drug targets.

TI == induction of lethal shock and tolerance by porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide in d-galactosamine-sensitized c3h/hej mice.
AB == lipopolysaccharide (lps) obtained from porphyromonas gingivalis was found to exhibit marked lethal toxicity in galactosamine-sensitized c3h/hej mice. although no lethality was observed in mice intraperitoneally challenged with 1 mg of p. gingivalis lps without galactosamine, when they were sensitized with 30 mg of galactosamine, challenge with 1 and 10 micrograms of lps resulted in 67 and 100% lethality, respectively. the lethal dose of lps was almost the same in lps-responsive c57bl/6 mice and non-lps-responsive c3h/hej mice. furthermore, when 1 microgram of p. gingivalis lps was administered to each mouse 90 min before the challenge with the same lps with galactosamine, tolerance to the lethal action of lps was induced, and the mice were completely protected from death, even at a dose 100-fold greater than the lethal dose of lps. neither a lethal effect nor induction of tolerance to the lethality of p. gingivalis lps was exhibited by salmonella lps in galactosamine-sensitized c3h/hej mice. a protein-lps complex derived from pseudomonas aeruginosa, which exhibited strong lethality and induced tolerance to a subsequent challenge with a lethal dose of lps in galactosamine-sensitized lps-responsive mice, did not exhibit lethal toxicity in galactosamine-sensitized c3h/hej mice and failed to induce tolerance in these mice to the lethality of p. gingivalis lps. these results indicate that p. gingivalis lps plays the central role in the activation of non-lps-responsive c3h/hej mice.

TI == clinical and microbiological features of refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the clinical parameters and the  site prevalence and levels of 40 subgingival species in successfully treated and refractory periodontitis subjects. 94 subjects received scaling and root planing and if needed, periodontal surgery and systemically administered tetracycline. 28 refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or > 3 sites showing attachment loss > 2.5 mm within 1 year post-therapy. 66 successfully treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss > 2.5 mm. baseline subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the mean levels and % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject and differences between groups sought using the mann-whitney test. most of the 40 species tested, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus, were equally or less prevalent in the refractory group. prevotella nigrescens was significantly more prevalent in successfully treated subjects, while refractory subjects harbored a larger proportion of streptococcus species, particularly streptococcus constellatus. the odds of a subject being refractory was 8.6 (p < 0.001) if s. constellatus constituted > or = 3.5% of the total dna probe count. since few microbiological differences existed between treatment outcome groups using dna probes to known species, the predominant cultivable microbiota of 33 subgingival samples from 14 refractory subjects was examined. 85% of the 1649 isolates were identified using probes to 69 recognized subgingival species. the remaining unidentified strains were classified by analyzing 16s rrna gene sequences. many sequenced isolates were of taxa not considered a common part of the oral microbiota such as acinetobacter baumanni, gemella haemolysans, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus warneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa and novel species in the genera bartonella, ralstonia, neisseria, eubacterium, rothia, gordona, gemella, corynebacterium, leptotrichia, and actinomyces. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their subgingival microbiota. as a group, they did not harbor more of the "classic" periodontopathogens, although elevated proportions of s. constellatus were found.

TI == periodontal microflora of hiv infected patients with periodontitis.
AB == the aim of this study was to determine the microbial profile of periodontal lesions in hiv seropositive patients and to compare it with rapidly progressing periodontal lesions in systemically healthy patients. the subgingival microflora of 20 cdc ii, 20 cdc iii, 20 cdc iv/v and 20 systemically healthy patients with rapidly progressing periodontitis was examined. four sites with greatest probing depth in each patient were selected for microbiological sampling. the samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. the microflora of periodontitis lesions within the three stages of the hiv infection was similar to that of progressing periodontitis in systemically healthy adults including campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, selenomonas spp. and peptostreptococcus micros. however, hiv seropositive periodontitis lesions harboured a range of exogenous pathogens rarely associated with common types of periodontitis including staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloaca, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus avium, clostridium difficile, aspergillus fumigatus, klebsiella pneumoniae and mycoplasma incognitum. the lack of immune effector and regulatory cells in hiv infected patients could in fact explain the increase of some opportunistic pathogens and the characteristic and rapidly progressing nature of the periodontal disease in these patients.

TI == ability of bacteria associated with chronic inflammatory disease to stimulate e-selectin expression and promote neutrophil adhesion.
AB == porphyromonas gingivalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and helicobacter pylori have been shown to be associated with adult periodontal disease, chronic lung infections, and peptic ulcers, respectively. the ability of these bacteria to stimulate e-selectin expression and promote neutrophil adhesion, two components necessary for the recruitment of leukocytes in response to infection, was investigated. little or no stimulation of e-selectin expression was observed with either p. gingivalis or h. pylori when whole cells, lipopolysaccharide (lps), or cell wall preparations added to human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells were examined. p. aeruginosa was able to induce e-selectin to near-maximal levels; however, it required approximately 100 to 1,000 times more whole cells or lps than that required by e. coli. neutrophil-binding assays revealed that lps and cell wall preparations obtained from these bacteria did not promote endothelial cell adhesiveness by e-selectin-independent mechanisms. in addition, p. gingivalis lps blocked e-selectin expression by lps obtained from other bacteria. we propose that lack of e-selectin stimulation and the inability to promote endothelial cell adhesiveness are two additional indications of low biologically reactive lps. we suggest that this property of lps may contribute to host tissue colonization. in addition, the ability of p. gingivalis to inhibit e-selectin expression may represent a new virulence factor for this organism.
