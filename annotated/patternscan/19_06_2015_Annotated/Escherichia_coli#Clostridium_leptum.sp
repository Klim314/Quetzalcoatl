TI  == butyrylated starch intake can prevent red meat-induced o6-methyl-2-deoxyguanosine adducts in human rectal tissue: a randomised clinical trial.
AB  == epidemiological studies have identified increased colorectal cancer (crc) risk with high red meat (hrm) intakes, whereas dietary fibre intake appears to be protective. in the present study, we examined whether a hrm diet increased rectal o6-methyl-2-deoxyguanosine (o6meg) adduct levels in healthy human subjects, and whether butyrylated high-amylose maize starch (hamsb) was protective. a group of  twenty-three individuals consumed 300 g/d of cooked red meat without (hrm diet) or with 40 g/d of hamsb (hrm+hamsb diet) over 4-week periods separated by a 4-week washout in a randomised cross-over design. stool and rectal biopsy samples were collected for biochemical, microbial and immunohistochemical analyses at baseline and at the end of each 4-week intervention period. the hrm diet increased rectal o6meg adducts relative to its baseline by 21 % (p< 0.01), whereas the addition of hamsb to the hrm diet prevented this increase. epithelial proliferation increased with both the hrm (p< 0.001) and hrm+hamsb (p< 0.05) diets when compared with their respective baseline levels, but was lower following the hrm+hamsb diet compared with the hrm diet (p< 0.05). relative to its baseline, the hrm+hamsb diet increased the excretion of scfa by over 20 % (p< 0.05) and increased the absolute abundances of the clostridium coccoides group (p< 0.05), the clostridium leptum group (p< 0.05), lactobacillus spp. (p< 0.01),  parabacteroides distasonis (p< 0.001) and ruminococcus bromii (p< 0.05), but lowered ruminococcus torques (p< 0.05) and the proportions of ruminococcus gnavus, ruminococcus torques and escherichia coli (p< 0.01). hrm consumption could increase the risk of crc through increased formation of colorectal epithelial o6meg adducts. hamsb consumption prevented red meat-induced adduct formation, which may be associated with increased stool scfa levels and/or changes in the microbiota composition.

TI  == phytase modulates ileal microbiota and enhances growth performance of the broiler chickens.
AB  == phytase is well studied and explored, however, little is known about its effects  on the microbial ecology of the gastrointestinal tract. in total, 400 one-day-old female ross 308 chicks were randomly distributed to four experimental groups. the dietary treatments were arranged as a 2 x 2 complete factorial design, with the factors being adequate (pc) or insufficient calcium (ca) and digestible phosphor  (dp)(nc) and with or without 5000 phytase units (ftu)/kg of escherichia coli 6-phytase. the gastrointestinal tract ph values, ileal microbial communities and  short-chain fatty acid concentrations in the digesta were determined. the reduction in ca and dp concentration significantly affected ph in the crop and caeca, and addition of phytase to the nc resulted in a ph increase in the ileum.  the reduction in ca and dp concentration significantly lowered, while phytase supplementation increased ileal total bacterial counts. additionally, the deficient diet reduced butyrate- but increased lactate-producing bacteria. the addition of phytase increased lactobacillus sp./enterococcus sp. whereas in case  of clostridium leptum subgroup, clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale cluster, bifidobacterium sp. and streptococcus/lactococcus counts, a significant  ca and dp level x phytase interaction was found. however, the recorded interactions indicated that the effects of phytase and ca and dp levels were not  consistent. furthermore, the reduction of ca and dp level lowered clostridium perfringens and enterobacteriaceae counts. the analysis of fermentation products  showed that reducing the ca and dp content in the diet reduced total scfa, dl-lactate, and acetic acid in the ileum whereas phytase increased concentrations of these acids in the nc group. this suggests that p is a factor which limits fermentation in the ileum. it may be concluded that phytase plays a role in modulating the gut microbiota of chicken, however, this is clearly linked with the levels of p and ca in a diet.

TI  == intestinal microbiota in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
AB  == despite evidence that the intestinal microbiota (im) is involved in the pathogenesis of obesity, the im composition of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) has not been well characterized. this prospective, cross-sectional study was aimed at identifying differences in im between adults with biopsy-proven nafld (simple steatosis [ss] or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [nash]) and living liver donors as healthy controls (hc). fifty subjects were included: 11 ss, 22 nash, and 17 hc. one stool sample was collected from each participant. quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to measure total bacterial counts, bacteroides/prevotella (herein referred to as bacteroidetes), clostridium leptum, c. coccoides, bifidobacteria, escherichia coli and archaea in stool. clinical and laboratory data, food records, and activity logs were collected. patients with nash had a lower percentage of bacteroidetes (bacteroidetes to total bacteria counts) compared to both ss and hc (p = 0.006) and higher fecal c. coccoides compared to those with ss (p = 0.04). there were no differences in the remaining microorganisms. as body mass index (bmi) and dietary fat intake differed between the groups (p < 0.05), we performed linear regression adjusting for these variables. the difference in c. coccoides was no longer significant after adjusting for bmi and fat intake. however, there  continued to be a significant association between the presence of nash and lower  percentage bacteroidetes even after adjusting for these variables (p = 0.002; 95% confidence interval = -0.06 to -0.02). conclusion: there is an inverse and diet-/bmi-independent association between the presence of nash and percentage bacteroidetes in the stool, suggesting that the im may play a role in the development of nafld.

TI  == cytokine response of human mononuclear cells induced by intestinal clostridium species.
AB  == altered composition of intestinal microbiota has been associated with various immunological disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. although clostridium  species are major inhabitants of the intestinal tract, their interaction with the host immunological system is yet poorly characterized. in this study, cytokine responses of human monocytic cell line thp-1 and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) to six type strains representing common intestinal clostridial species were determined. the strains induced diverse cytokine responses in both thp-1 cells and pbmc. clostridium perfringens was the most potent inducer of both tumour necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-10 (il-10), as compared  to clostridium histolyticum, clostridium clostridioforme, clostridium leptum, clostridium sporosphaeroides and blautia coccoides. interleukin-8 (il-8) production in pbmc was most efficiently stimulated by c. sporosphaeroides. the same pbmc preparations that responded strongly to escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (lps) also responded strongly to bacterial stimulation. this indicates that the level of responsiveness is an individual feature of mononuclear cell preparations, and that the overall cytokine response is composed by a combination of host factors and microbial structures affecting them. this work supports the idea that the composition of the intestinal clostridial population influences immune responses and is likely to play an important role in intestinal homeostasis.

TI  == studies on the effects of essential-oil-based feed additives on performance, ileal nutrient digestibility, and selected bacterial groups in the gastrointestinal tract of piglets.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the effects of 2 different phytogenic products on performance, ileal nutrient digestibility, and composition of the intestinal microbiota. the 2 phytogenic products contained different essential oil mixtures (eom) characterized by either menthol (mentha arvensis; eom-m) or cinnamon aldehyde (cinnamomum aromaticum; eom-c) as main constituents. three treatments consisted of control diet without eom addition and diets supplemented  with eom-m or eom-c. reproducibility of the effects was examined in 4 trials with a total of 300 male castrated and female piglets weaned at 25 d of age. the number of pens per treatment in trials i through iii were 7, 9, and 9, respectively, for research station conditions, and 10 in trial iv for simulated farm conditions. in research station conditions, the experimental unit consisted  of flat deck pens with 2 piglets per pen, whereas it consisted of floor pens with straw bedding with 5 piglets per pen in farm conditions. the feed additives had no effect on feed intake or bw gain. improvements (p < 0.05) in g:f were observed for eom-m supplemented diets in 2 of 4 trials as well as for the combined data of all trials. these improvements were associated with greater (p<0.05) apparent ileal digestibility of cp and of most aa. the effect of eom-c on these response criteria was intermediate between control and eom-m. real-time pcr analysis of the gastrointestinal contents for 7 bacterial groups (lactobacillus spp., enterococcus spp., clostridium coccoides and clostridium leptum cluster, escherichia spp., and escherichia coli toxin estii) indicated no effect of treatments on the gastrointestinal microbiota. it was concluded that eom-m consistently improved feed efficiency in weaned piglets, and it was associated with improved ileal protein and aa digestibility. in general, however, the effectiveness of eom as feed additives differs considerably depending on the constituents.

TI  == the firmicutes/bacteroidetes ratio of the human microbiota changes with age.
AB  == background: in humans, the intestinal microbiota plays an important role in the maintenance of host health by providing energy, nutrients, and immunological protection. applying current molecular methods is necessary to surmount the limitations of classical culturing techniques in order to obtain an accurate description of the microbiota composition. results: here we report on the comparative assessment of human fecal microbiota from three age-groups: infants,  adults and the elderly. we demonstrate that the human intestinal microbiota undergoes maturation from birth to adulthood and is further altered with ageing.  the counts of major bacterial groups clostridium leptum, clostridium coccoides, bacteroidetes, bifidobacterium, lactobacillus and escherichia coli were assessed  by quantitative pcr (qpcr). by comparing species diversity profiles, we observed  age-related changes in the human fecal microbiota. the microbiota of infants was  generally characterized by low levels of total bacteria. c. leptum and c. coccoides species were highly represented in the microbiota of infants, while elderly subjects exhibited high levels of e. coli and bacteroidetes. we observed  that the ratio of firmicutes to bacteroidetes evolves during different life stages. for infants, adults and elderly individuals we measured ratios of 0.4, 10.9 and 0.6, respectively. conclusion: in this work we have confirmed that qpcr  is a powerful technique in studying the diverse and complex fecal microbiota. our work demonstrates that the fecal microbiota composition evolves throughout life,  from early childhood to old age.

TI  == development of a membrane-array method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == a membrane-array method was developed for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples without using the expensive microarray-arrayer and laser-scanner. the 16s rdna sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to nitrocellulose membranes. digoxigenin (dig)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or pure cultured bacteria using two universal primers, and were hybridized to the membrane-array. hybridization signals were read by nbt/bcip color development. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, b. fragilis, b. distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, c. leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, r. bromii, r. callidus, r. albus, bifidobacterium  longum, b. adolescentis, b. infantis, eubacterium biforme, e. aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus,escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the membrane-array method is a reliable technique for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples. the result was also confirmed by  using specific pcr methods for these bacteria.

TI  == design and evaluation of oligonucleotide-microarray method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == an oligonucleotide-microarray method was developed for the detection of intestinal bacteria in fecal samples collected from human subjects. the 16s rdna  sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to glass slides. cyanine5 (cy5)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or bacterial dna using two universal primers and were hybridized to the oligo-microarray. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, clostridium leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, ruminococcus bromii, ruminococcus callidus, ruminococcus albus, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium infantis, eubacterium biforme, eubacterium aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the oligo-microarray method developed in this study is a reliable method for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples.

TI  == identification of predominant human and animal anaerobic intestinal bacterial species by terminal restriction fragment patterns (trfps): a rapid, pcr-based method.
AB  == identification of predominant human and animal intestinal tract anaerobes by conventional methods is cumbersome, time-consuming and less sensitive as compared to molecular methods. we have developed a molecular technique to identify most of the abundant intestinal microflora by polyermase chain reaction (pcr) amplification of a 16s rrna gene fragment using a pair of universal pcr primers.  the forward pcr primer was labelled with 6-carboxyfluorescein amino hexy (6-fam)  fluorescent dye to detect the terminal fragment of the pcr products after digestion with restriction enzymes. the pcr products were purified and digested with restriction enzymes and were analysed by capillary electrophoresis using an  automated dna sequencer. the data was analysed with genescan software 2.1. eleven bacteria (eubacterium biforme, e. limosum, peptostreptococcus productus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, c. leptum, c. perfringens and escherichia coli) that are predominant in human and animal intestinal tract were  successfully identified by this rapid molecular technique. this protocol is rapid, accurate, sensitive and capable of identifying multiple organisms in a single sample.
