TI  == characterization of the porphyromonas gingivalis conjugative transposon ctnpg1: determination of the integration site and the genes essential for conjugal transfer.
AB  == in our previous study, extensive genomic rearrangements were found in two strains of the gram-negative anaerobic bacterium porphyromonas (por.) gingivalis, and most of these rearrangements were associated with mobile genetic elements such as insertion sequences and conjugative transposons (ctns). ctnpg1, identified in por. gingivalis strain atcc 33277, was the first complete ctn reported for the genus porphyromonas. in the present study, we found that ctnpg1 can be transferred from strain atcc 33277 to another por. gingivalis strain, w83, at a frequency of 10(-7) to 10(-6). the excision of ctnpg1 from the chromosome in a donor cell depends on an integrase (int; pgn_0094) encoded in ctnpg1, whereas ctnpg1 excision is independent of pgn_0084 (a dna topoisomerase i homologue; exc) encoded within ctnpg1 and reca (pgn_1057) on the donor chromosome. intriguingly,  however, the transfer of ctnpg1 between por. gingivalis strains requires reca function in the recipient. sequencing analysis of ctnpg1-integrated sites on the  chromosomes of transconjugants revealed that the consensus attachment (att) sequence is a 13 bp sequence, ttttcnnnnaaaa. we further report that ctnpg1 is able to transfer to two other bacterial species, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and prevotella oralis. in addition, ctnpg1-like ctns are located in the genomes of other oral anaerobic bacteria, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella buccae and  prevotella intermedia, with the same consensus att sequence. these results suggest that ctns in the ctnpg1 family are widely distributed among oral anaerobic gram-negative bacteria found in humans and play important roles in horizontal gene transfer among these bacteria.

TI  == identification of proteases from periodontopathogenic bacteria as activators of latent human neutrophil and fibroblast-type interstitial collagenases.
AB  == activation of latent human fibroblast-type and neutrophil interstitial procollagenases as well as degradation of native type i collagen by supra- and subgingival dental plaque extracts, an 80-kda trypsinlike protease from porphyromas gingivalis (atcc 33277), a 95-kda chymotrypsinlike protease from treponema denticola (atcc 29522), and selected bacterial species commonly isolated in periodontitis was studied. the bacteria included were prevotella intermedia (atcc 25261), prevotella buccae (es 57), prevotella oris (atcc 33573), porphyromonas endodontalis (es 54b), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (atcc 295222), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc 10953), mitsuokella dentalis (dsm 3688), and streptococcus mitis (atcc 15909). none of the bacteria activated latent procollagenases; however, both sub- and supragingival dental plaque extracts (neutral salt extraction) and proteases isolated from cell extracts from potentially periodontopathogenic bacteria p. gingivalis and t. denticola were found to activate latent human fibroblast-type and neutrophil interstitial procollagenases. the fibroblast-type interstitial collagenase was more efficiently activated by bacterial proteases than the neutrophil counterpart, which instead preferred nonproteolytic activation by the oxidative agent hypochlorous acid. the proteases were not able to convert collagenase tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (timp-1) complexes into active form or to change the ability of timp-1 to inhibit interstitial collagenase. none of the studied bacteria, proteases from p. gingivalis and t. denticola, or extracts of supra- and subgingival dental plaque showed any significant collagenolytic activity. however, the proteases degraded native and denatured collagen fragments after cleavage by interstitial collagenase and gelatinase. our results indicate that proteases from periodontopathogenic bacteria can act as direct proteolytic activators of human procollagenases and degrade collagen fragments. thus, in concert with host enzymes the bacterial proteases may participate in periodontal  tissue destruction.

TI  == multivariate analyses of fatty acid data from whole-cell methanolysates of prevotella, bacteroides and porphyromonas spp.
AB  == the genus bacteroides contains a number of biochemically and physiologically heterogeneous groups of organisms and needs taxonomic revision. in this study cellular fatty acids from a number of bacteroides spp. were identified and quantified using gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. the chemical data were then subjected to principal components analysis. in b. fragilis, which is the type species of the genus bacteroides, c3-oh-iso17 was the predominant fatty acid (38.0%) and cante15 was present in higher amounts (32.7%)  than ciso15 (14.6%). b. fragilis thus differed from all the other species examined: prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, p. (b.) oralis, p. (b.) oris, p. (b.)  disiens, p. (b.) veroralis, p. (b.) heparinolytica and porphyromonas (bacteroides) endodontalis. principal components analysis also enabled the closely related p. buccae, p. oralis and p. oris to be differentiated.

TI  == multivariate analyses of cellular fatty acids in bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, wolinella, and campylobacter spp.
AB  == the genera bacteroides, wolinella, and campylobacter contain several similar species that require taxonomic revision. fatty acid profiles of whole bacterial cells have proven useful for taxonomy. in this study, cellular fatty acids from bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, wolinella, and campylobacter spp. were identified and quantitated by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and the data were subjected to principal component analyses. bacteroides fragilis, the type species of the genus bacteroides, was distinct from the other organisms. while bacteroides gracilis, wolinella succinogenes, wolinella curva, wolinella recta, and campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis were  close to each other, prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, prevotella oralis, prevotella oris, prevotella disiens, prevotella veroralis, prevotella heparinolyticus, porphyromonas (bacteroides) endodontalis, and bacteroides ureolyticus could be distinguished. b. fragilis was characterized by the presence of c3oh-i-1-, ca-15, and ci-15 and the absence of c12:0 and unsaturated fatty acids. for comparison, b. gracilis, b. ureolyticus, w. succinogenes, w. curva, w. recta, and campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis contained c12:0, c16:1, c18:1, and c3-oh-14 acids but lacked branched hydroxy and branched nonhydroxy acids. b.  gracilis and b. ureolyticus are not "true" bacteroides.
