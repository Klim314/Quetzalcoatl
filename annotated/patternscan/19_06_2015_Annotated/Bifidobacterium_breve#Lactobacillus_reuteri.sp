TI  == the use of probiotics in pediatric gastroenterology: a review of the literature and recommendations by latin-american experts.
AB  == objective: the stability and composition of intestinal flora plays a vital role in human wellbeing throughout life from as early as birth. over the past 50 years, several studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of probiotic administration in pediatric gastroenterology. this document aims to provide a recommendation score on probiotic utilization in pediatric gastroenterology, together with a review of current knowledge concerning its benefits, tolerability, and safety. study design: published literature was selected without study design restriction: clinical guidelines, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials (rcts), cohort studies, outcomes research and case-controlled studies were selected using the following mesh-validated terms: probiotics, diarrhea, acute diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, traveler's diarrhea, bacterial diarrhea, nosocomial diarrhea, prophylactic diarrhea, helicobacter pylori infection, colic, infantile colic, necrotizing enterocolitis (nec), inflammatory bowel disease, constipation, and allergy. once the validity and the  quality of results were evaluated, a recommendation score and level of evidence were assigned for pediatric gastrointestinal-related conditions, according to the updated evidence-based medicine guidelines: 1a for systematic review (sr) of rcts, 1b for individual rct, 1c for sr and individual rct, 2a for sr of cohort studies, 2b for individual cohort studies, 2c for outcomes research, and 3a for sr of case-control studies. results and conclusions: the latin american expert group consensus recommends the use of the following probiotics for pediatric gastrointestinal conditions: prevention of acute infectious diarrhea (aid): 1b for bifidobacterium lactis, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg), and l. reuteri; prevention of nosocomial diarrhea: 1 b for b. lactis bb12, b. bifidum, lgg and streptococcus thermophiles; treatment of aid: 1a for lgg and s. boulardii, 1b for l. reuteri; prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea: 1b for lgg and s. boulardii; prevention of traveler's diarrhea: 1b for s. boulardii; prevention of  infantile colic: 1a for l. reuteri dsm 17938; treatment of infantile colic: 1b for l. reuteri dsm 17938; prevention of nec: 1a for b. breve, mixtures of bifidobacterium and streptococcus, lgg, l. acidophilus and l. reuteri dsm 17938;  induction and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis: 1b for vsl#3; improving symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome: 2c for lgg and vsl#3.

TI  == protection of probiotic bacteria in a synbiotic matrix following aerobic storage  at 4 degrees c.
AB  == the survival of single strains of bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum,  lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus reuteri was investigated in synbiotics that included 10 mg/ml of fructo-oligosaccharides, inulin and pectic-oligosaccharides in an alginate matrix under refrigerated (4 degrees c) aerobic storage conditions. when the matrices were cross-linked with calcium (45  mm), 102-103 cfu/ml of l. acidophilus and l. reuteri, and 0-103 cfu/ml of b. breve and b. longum survived refrigerated aerobic storage for 28 days. following  refrigerated storage, acetic (3-9 mm), butyric (0-2 mm), propionic (5-16 mm) and  lactic acids (1-48 mm) were produced during the growth of probiotics in bhi broth at 37 degrees c, suggesting their metabolic activity after storage was stressed.  when calcium cross-linking was not used in synbiotics, the matrix remained more gel-like after inoculation when compared to the calcium cross-linked matrix. at least 107 cfu/ml of probiotic bacteria survived after 21 days of storage within these gel-like alginate matrices. significantly higher levels of b. breve, l. acidophilus and l. reuteri were obtained from the synbiotic matrices supplemented with fructo-oligosaccharides, inulin and pectic-oligosaccharides compared to alginate alone. b. longum survival was the same (~7 logs) in all gel-like synbiotic matrices. these results show that synbiotics protected probiotic bacteria and extended their shelf-life under refrigerated aerobic conditions. synbiotics represent a viable delivery vehicle for health-promoting bacteria.

TI  == genetic and structural comparison of linoleate isomerases from selected food-grade bacteria.
AB  == aims: to advance the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the capacity of bifidobacteria and lactic bacteria to convert linoleic acid (la) into conjugated linoleic acid (cla) by the linoleate isomerase (li). methods and results: the potential li enzymes of selected lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and  leuconostoc strains were compared at the genetic, amino acid sequence and functional levels. genetic analysis was achieved by insertional mutagenesis and hybridization studies using a lact. reuteri li probe. biotransformation studies monitored by gas chromatography showed that bif. breve is a major cla producer after the reference lact. reuteri strain. the putative bif. breve li gene was pcr isolated and sequenced. conclusions: the putative li gene identified in this study seems essential for bacterial growth. comparative studies indicate that the deduced protein is membrane bound and reveal the presence of several highly conserved domains among a wide range of gram-positive bacteria. significance and  impact of the study: given the multiple health benefits of cla, the capability of some bacteria to convert la into cla is of great relevance. nevertheless, the yields of cla remain low, and the regulation of the process is far from being understood. a deeper knowledge of this capacity by the genetic studies is revealing the identity of the li and will eventually contribute to its control.

TI  == the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora of the human intestine: composition and succession.
AB  == lactobacillus and bifidobacterial cultures are increasingly used as probiotics in pharmaceuticals and in foods. the selection of strains is performed often for technological rather than for microecological reasons. detailed reports about species and strains composition of these microorganisms in the intestinal microflora of man are rare. our investigations were performed with samples originating from infants and adults, taken from faeces and from upper sections of the intestinal tract including mouth and stomach, and from caecum and colon. post mortem cases as well as test subjects under physiological conditions were analyzed using an automatic capsule system sampling at defined times in different parts of the intestinal tract. the fate of selected strains after oral intake was studied, too. furthermore, influences of the microflora originating from food were considered. the identification of autochthonous (indigenous) and allochthonous (transient) species could be achieved with descriptions of new species in the genera lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. l. gasseri and l. reuteri proved to be predominant autochthonous lactobacillus species in infants as well as in adults. both species were occasionally present even in the stomach. this was also the case with an anaerobic lactic acid bacterium, previously named  catenabacterium catenaforme, later classified as l. ruminis, a non-motile variant of this species. the bifidobacterial microflora differed in composition between infants and adults and in different stages of the host's life. up to 5 species or special strains of bifidobacteria could be present in different, individually fixed, combinations. species typical for infants were b. bifidum, b. infantis, b. breve, and b. parvulorum. typical for adults were 4 different variants of b. adolescentis. b. bifidum and b. longum could often be found in both groups, but in lower numbers. b. longum showed some oxygen tolerance whereas b. bifidum and b. adolescentis required strict anaerobic and fastidious conditions for cultivation. the autochthonous lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora in man will remain stable life-long. with lactobacilli, however, some successions may be caused by transient species derived from food or from the oral cavity, thus giving the impression of an altered microflora. nevertheless l. gasseri, l.  reuteri, l. ruminis, and to some degree, l. salivarius, may be present as autochthonous species all of the time. with bifidobacteria, a decreasing tendency in counts and in multiple composition in elderly people exists. furthermore, this microflora is also influenced by consumption habits, which are probably caused by geographical circumstances.
