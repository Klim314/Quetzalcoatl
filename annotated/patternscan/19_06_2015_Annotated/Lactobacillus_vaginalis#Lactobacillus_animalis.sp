TI  == characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  == the study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (lab) from fermented foods in xi'an, china. lab strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of lactobacillus (n = 73), and streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16s rrna gene. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and s. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of lactobacillus. the erm(b) gene was detected from two strains of each of l. fermentum and l. vaginalis, and one strain of each of l. plantarum, l. salivarius, l. acidophilus, l. animalis, and s. thermophilus. the tet genes were  identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. this is the first time, the authors identified tet(s) gene from l. brevis and l. kefiri. the  erm(b) gene from l. fermentum nwl24 and l. salivarius nwl33, and tet(m) gene from l. plantarum nwl22 and l. brevis nwl59 were successfully transferred to enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. it was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in xi'an, china and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.

TI  == production of exopolysaccharides by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains of  human origin, and metabolic activity of the producing bacteria in milk.
AB  == this work reports on the physicochemical characterization of 21 exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, as well as the growth and metabolic activity of the eps-producing strains in milk. the strains belong to the species  lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus vaginalis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. the molar mass distribution of eps fractions showed 2 peaks of different sizes, which is a feature shared with some eps from bacteria of food origin. in general, we detected an association between the eps size distribution and the eps-producing species, although because of the low numbers of human bacterial eps tested, we could not conclusively establish a correlation. the main monosaccharide components of the eps under study were glucose, galactose, and rhamnose, which are the same as those found in food polymers; however, the rhamnose and glucose ratios was generally higher than the  galactose ratio in our human bacterial eps. all eps-producing strains were able to grow and acidify milk; most lactobacilli produced lactic acid as the main metabolite. the lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio in bifidobacteria was 0.7, close to the theoretical ratio, indicating that the eps-producing strains did not produce an excessive amount of acetic acid, which could adversely affect the sensory properties of fermented milks. with respect to their viscosity-intensifying ability, l. plantarum h2 and l. rhamnosus e41 and e43r were able to increase the viscosity of stirred, fermented milks to a similar extent as the eps-producing streptococcus thermophilus strain used as a positive  control. therefore, these human eps-producing bacteria could be used as adjuncts  in mixed cultures for the formulation of functional foods if probiotic characteristics could be demonstrated. this is the first article reporting the physicochemical characteristics of eps isolated from human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == screening of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria for potential probiotic use  in iberian dry fermented sausages.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to select lactic acid bacteria and bifibobacteria strains as potential probiotic cultures during the processing of iberian dry fermented sausages. a total of 1000 strains were isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages (363), and human (337) and pig faeces (300) in different culture media. around 30% of these strains, mainly isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages in lamvab agar, were pre-selected for testing as potential probiotics by their ability to grow adequately at the ph values and nacl concentrations of these meat products during the ripening process. of the in vitro investigations used to predict the survival of a strain in conditions present in the gastro intestinal tract, exposure to ph 2.5 showed itself to be a  highly discriminating factor with only 51 out of 312 pre-selected strains resisting adequately after 1.5h of exposure. all acid-resistant isolates identified as lactobacilli originated from human faeces (lactobacillus casei and  lactobacillus fermentum) and pig faeces (lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus animalis, lactobacillus murinus, and lactobacillus vaginalis). pediococcus acidilactici strains were isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages and pig faeces, whereas the greatest number of enterococcus strains were identified as enterococcus faecium, with this species being isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages, and human and pig faeces. most of these strains are promising probiotic meat culture candidates suitable for iberian dry fermented sausages.
