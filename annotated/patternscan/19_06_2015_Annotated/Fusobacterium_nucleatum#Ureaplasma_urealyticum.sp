TI  == a sonographic short cervix as the only clinical manifestation of intra-amniotic infection.
AB  == objective: a sonographically short cervix is a powerful predictor of spontaneous  preterm delivery. however, the etiology and optimal management of a patient with  a short cervix in the mid-trimester of pregnancy remain uncertain. microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (miac) and intra-amniotic inflammation are frequently present in patients with spontaneous preterm labor or acute cervical insufficiency. this study was conducted to determine the rate of miac and intra-amniotic inflammation in patients with a cervical length < 25 mm in the mid-trimester. study design: a retrospective cohort study was conducted of patients referred to our high risk clinic because of a sonographic short cervix or a history of a previous preterm birth. amniocenteses were performed for the evaluation of miac and for karyotype analysis in patients with a short cervix. fluid was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, as well as genital mycoplasmas. patients with miac were treated with antibiotics selected by their physician. results: of 152 patients with a short cervix at 14-24 weeks, 57 had amniotic fluid analysis. the prevalence of miac was 9% (5/57). among these patients, the rate of preterm delivery (< 32 weeks) was 40% (2/5). microorganisms isolated from amniotic fluid included ureaplasma urealyticum (n=4) and fusobacterium nucleatum (n=1). patients with a positive culture for ureaplasma urealyticum received intravenous azithromycin. three patients with ureaplasma urealyticum had a sterile amniotic fluid culture after treatment, and subsequently delivered at term. the patient with fusobacterium nucleatum developed clinical chorioamnionitis and was induced. conclusion: (1) sub-clinical miac was detected in 9% of patients with a sonographically short cervix (< 25 mm); and (2) maternal parenteral treatment with antibiotics can eradicate miac caused by ureaplasma urealyticum. this was associated with delivery at term in the three patients whose successful treatment was documented by microbiologic studies.

TI  == identification and sequencing of bacterial rdnas in culture-negative amniotic fluid from women in premature labor.
AB  == our objective was to identify bacterial species present in culture-negative but 16s rdna-positive amniotic fluid samples from women in preterm labor. amniotic fluid from 69 women in preterm labor was cultured and examined for the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (il-6). polymerase chain reaction technology was used to detect highly conserved bacterial ribosomal dna sequences  (16s rdnas). as previously reported, 16s rdnas were identified in 15 (94%) of 16  culture-positive amniotic fluid samples, in 5 (36%) of 14 culture-negative samples with elevated il-6, and in 1 (3%) of 39 culture-negative samples with low il-6 levels. direct sequencing was performed of 16s rdnas from the 5 culture-negative amniotic fluid specimens with elevated il-6, followed by database searches and phylogenetic analyses. the bacterial sequences identified included: two leptotrichia sanguinegens, one human oral bacterium a33, one fusobacterium nucleatum, and one ureaplasma urealyticum. identification and sequencing of 16s rdnas in amniotic fluid is a promising technique to identify bacterial species associated with elevated il-6 levels in culture-negative amniotic fluid that may contribute to the etiology of premature labor.

TI  == preterm birth: associations with genital and possibly oral microflora.
AB  == opportunistic pathogenic microbes are indigenous to the female lower genital tract and etiologic in many types of pelvic infections and, apparently, a portion of preterm birth (ptb) cases. bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a clinical syndrome based on an altered genital microflora in which gardnerella vaginalis; anaerobic  species primarily among prevotella, porphyromonas, bacteroides, peptostreptococcus, and mobiluncus; mycoplasma hominis; and ureaplasma urealyticum become predominant in vaginal secretions. this bv complex of microbes, compared to a normal vaginal microflora dominated by facultative lactobacilli, is associated with significantly increased risks for preterm labor, preterm premature rupture of membranes, ptb, and other perinatal infectious complications. pathogenetic mechanisms include an ascending route of infection and/or inflammatory process due to microbial products and maternal and/or fetal response(s) with production of prostaglandins and cytokines. in the presence of periodontal disease, oral opportunistic pathogens and/or their inflammatory products also may have a role in prematurity via a hematogenous route. fusobacterium nucleatum, a common oral species, is the most frequently isolated species from amniotic fluid cultures among women with preterm labor and intact membranes. also, the species and subspecies of fusobacteria identified from amniotic fluid most closely match those reported from healthy and diseased subgingival sites, namely f. nucleatum subspecies vincentii and f. nucleatum subspecies nucleatum, compared to strains identified from the lower genital tract. although these fusobacteria also could be acquired through cunnilingus from a partner, new data associating maternal periodontal disease with preterm low birth weight taken with the isolation of f. nucleatum, capnocytophaga, and other oral species from amniotic fluid support further study of a possible additional route, oral-hematogenous, to ptb.

TI  == the normal vaginal flora, h2o2-producing lactobacilli, and bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women.
AB  == in this study of the vaginal flora of 171 pregnant women in labor at term, the flora was categorized as normal (lactobacillus predominant), intermediate, or representative of bacterial vaginosis (bv) on the basis of a vaginal smear. bv was diagnosed in 39 women (23%); the vaginal flora was classified as normal in 50% of cases and as intermediate in 27%. h2o2-producing lactobacilli were recovered from 5% of women with bv, 37% of those with an intermediate flora, and  61% of those with a normal flora. h2o2-negative lactobacilli were equally frequent (57%-65%) in all three groups. the microorganisms most frequently recovered from women with bv included gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia/disiens, bacteroides ureolyticus, prevotella corporis/bacteroides levii, fusobacterium nucleatum, mobiluncus species, peptostreptococcus prevotii, peptostreptococcus tetradius, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, viridans streptococci, ureaplasma urealyticum, and mycoplasma hominis (p < .05 for each).  the presence of all but three of these organisms was inversely related to vaginal colonization by h2o2-producing lactobacilli; the exceptions were b. ureolyticus,  f. nucleatum, and p. prevotii. other microorganisms were equally frequent among women with and without bv. we conclude that specific groups of anaerobes are associated with bv in this population and that a strong association exists between species associated with bv and those inhibited by h2o2-producing lactobacilli.

TI  == the association of occult amniotic fluid infection with gestational age and neonatal outcome among women in preterm labor.
AB  == to evaluate the relationships between gestational age, neonatal outcome, and amniotic fluid (af) bacteria, we obtained af from women with intact membranes in  idiopathic preterm labor. positive cultures were obtained from 20 (19%) of 105 women. the frequency of positive cultures was inversely related to gestational age: 23-26 weeks, nine of 20; 27-30 weeks, four of 24; and 31-34 weeks, seven of  61 (chi2 for trend, p less than .001). fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides ureolyticus, and ureaplasma urealyticum were the most common isolates. facultative and anaerobic bacteria were more commonly isolated from women at less than 30 weeks' gestation, and ureaplasma urealyticum was commonly isolated at greater than 30 weeks' gestation. forty percent of the patients identified as having positive af facultative and anaerobic cultures by the research laboratory  had negative cultures in the clinical laboratory. clinical characteristics and maternal white blood cell count and differential did not differ between women with and without positive cultures. elevated c-reactive protein levels and a positive af gram stain were the two most sensitive and specific methods to predict positive af cultures. women with positive cultures delivered a median of  1.0 day after enrollment, compared with 28.5 days for women with negative cultures. the median gestational age at delivery for women with positive cultures was 27.5 weeks, and the median birth weight was 866 g. positive af cultures were  associated with respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and neonatal death. if occult af infection among women in preterm labor is a treatable cause of preterm birth, then treatment could markedly reduce both perinatal morbidity and mortality.

TI  == prostaglandin production by amnion and decidual cells in response to bacterial products.
AB  == media from bacterial cultures have been tested for actions on prostaglandin biosynthesis by human amnion and decidual cells. the bacterial species, which are commonly associated with intrauterine infections, were group b streptococcus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, gardnerella vaginalis, neisseria gonorrhea, mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum. overall, low doses of bacterial products were stimulatory of amnion prostaglandin production, whereas high doses were inhibitory. a similar pattern of results was  obtained for effects on decidual prostaglandin production, although stimulatory actions at low doses were less pronounced. in all experiments interleukin 1 beta  consistently induced a stimulation of prostaglandin production that greatly exceeded that caused by any bacterial product. it is possible that the inhibitory action of high doses of bacterial products on prostaglandin biosynthesis may contribute to the poor course of labor experienced by women with chorioamnionitis. furthermore, these data lend credence to the view that the host response to infection (i.e. cytokine secretion) is the major mediator of subsequent preterm labor.

TI  == characterization of the tet m determinants in urogenital and respiratory bacteria.
AB  == tetracycline-resistant fusobacterium nucleatum, haemophilus ducreyi, mycoplasma hominis, peptostreptococcus spp., ureaplasma urealyticum, and veillonella parvula had dna sequences which showed homology throughout the length of the tet m transposon, tn916. in contrast, gardnerella vaginalis, commensal neisseria spp.,  and the 25.2-megadalton plasmid family lacked the complete transposon.
