TI  - The dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase of Aeromonas caviae ST exhibits NADH-dependent tellurite reductase activity.
AB  - Potassium tellurite (K(2)TeO(3)) is extremely toxic for most forms of life and only a limited number of organisms are naturally resistant to the toxic effects of this compound. Crude extracts prepared from the environmental isolate Aeromonas caviae ST catalize the in vitro reduction of TeO32- in a NADH-dependent reaction. Upon fractionation by ionic exchange column chromatography three major polypeptides identified as the E1, E2, and E3 components of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex were identified in fractions exhibiting tellurite-reducing activity. Tellurite reductase and pyruvate dehydrogenase activities co-eluted from a Sephadex gel filtration column. To determine which component(s) of the PDH complex has tellurite reductase activity, the A. caviae ST structural genes encoding for E1 (aceE), E2 (aceF), and E3 (lpdA) were independently cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and their gene products purified. Results indicated that tellurite reductase activity lies almost exclusively in the E3 component, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase. The E3 component of the PDH complex from E. coli, Zymomonas mobilis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Geobacillus stearothermophilus also showed NADH-dependent tellurite reductase in vitro suggesting that this enzymatic activity is widely distributed among microorganisms.
TI  - Isolation, characterization and sequence analysis of the scrK gene encoding fructokinase of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - A gene encoding an ATP-dependent fructokinase from Streptococcus mutans GS-5 was  identified within a 2 kb DNA fragment immediately downstream from the scrA gene. The gene cloned in Escherichia coli also expressed mannokinase activity. Insertional inactivation of this gene in S. mutans markedly decreased both fructokinase and mannokinase activities. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the 2 kb fragment revealed an ORF starting 199 bp downstream from the scrA gene, preceded by potential ribosome-binding (Shine-Dalgarno) and promoter-like sequences. This ORF specified a putative protein of 293 amino acids with a calculated M(r) of 31,681. The deduced amino acid sequence of the fructokinase gene, scrK, from S. mutans exhibited no significant similarity to fructokinase genes from Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli plasmid pUR400 or Vibrio alginolyticus, but was similar to a comparable gene from Zymomonas mobilis.
