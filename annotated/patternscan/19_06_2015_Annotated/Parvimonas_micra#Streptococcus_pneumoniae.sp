TI  == antimicrobial activity of preparation bioaron c.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of sirupus bioaron c, a preparation, whose main ingredient is an extract from the leaves of aloe arborescens, was tested against  different microorganisms isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections. the experiments were performed on 40 strains: 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria, 13 strains of aerobic bacteria and 7 strains of yeast-like fungi from the genus candida and on 18 reference strains (atcc). the antimicrobial activity  of bioaron c (mbc and mfc) was determined at undiluted concentration. bioaron c proved to be very effective against the microorganisms causing infections. at the concentration recommended by the producer, the preparation showed biocidal activity (mbc, mfc) against the strains of the pathogenic microorganisms, which cause respiratory infections most frequently, including, among others, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, parvimonas micra, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus anginosus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans, already after 15 min. the mic of bioaron c against most of the tested microorganisms was 5 to 100 times lower than the usually applied concentration. the great antimicrobial activity means that the preparation may be used in the prevention and treatment of infections of the upper respiratory tract. bioaron c  may be an alternative or complement to classical therapy, especially in children.

TI  == [periodontitis and cardiovascular disease].
AB  == the prevalence of periodontitis and cardiovascular disease (cvd) is high. a mixed infectious biofilm etiology of periodontitis is known but not fully established in cvd. cofactors; smoking habits, stress, ethnicity, genetics, socioeconomics and age contribute to both diseases. the objectives of this report are to summarize factors in regards to cvd and periodontitis that are clinically relevant. the hypothesis behind a relationship between the two conditions can be  founded in (i) shared infections etiology, (ii) shared inflammatory response, (iii) epidemiological and case-control studies, and (iv) periodontal studies demonstrating improvements of cvd markers. streptococcus species in the s. mitis  group, and s. anginosus group have been identified in periodontitis and are known as pathogens in endocarditis possibly transported from the oral cavity to the heart through bacteremia during dental therapies, and tooth brushing. other periodontal bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and parvimonas micra are beta-lactamase producing and may contribute to antibiotic resistance (extended spectrum beta-lactamases). other bacteria in cvd  and periodontitis include staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. chlamydia pneumoniae and p. gingivalis lipopolyysaccharide capsels share homology and induce heat-shock protein activity and a cascade of proinflammatory cytokines. associations between periodontitis and cvd have been presented in many studies when controlling for confounders. other studies have demonstrated that periodontal therapies increase brachial artery flow rate and reduce serum inflammatory cytokine levels. thus, physicians caring for subjects at cvd risk should consult with dentists/periodontists. dentists must improve their medical knowledge and also learn to consult with physicians when treating patients at cvd risk.
