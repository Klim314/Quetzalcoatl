TI  == identification of lactobacilli with inhibitory effect on biofilm formation by pathogenic bacteria on stainless steel surfaces.
AB  == two hundred and thirty individual clones of microorganisms were recovered from milk tanks and milking machine surfaces at two distinct farms (bejaja city, algeria). of these clones, 130 were identified as lactic acid bacteria (lab). in  addition escherichia coli, salmonella, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa species were identified in the remaining 100 isolates-spoilage isolate. these isolates were assayed for ability to form biofilms. s. aureus, lactobacillus brevis strains lb1f2, lb14f1 and lb15f1, and lactobacillus pentosus strains lb2f2 and lb3f2 were identified as the best biofilm formers. besides, these lab isolates were able to produce proteinaceous substances with antagonism  against the aforementioned spoilage isolates, when grown in mrs or tsb-ye media.  during the screening, l. pentosus lb3f2 exhibited the highest antibacterial activity when grown in tsb-ye medium at 30 degrees c. additionally, l. pentosus lb3f2 was able to strongly hamper the adhesion of s. aureus sa3 on abiotic surfaces as polystyrene and stainless steel slides. lab isolates did not show any hemolytic activity and all of them were sensitive to different families of antibiotic tested. it should be pointed out that lb3f2 isolate was not cytotoxic  on the intestinal cells but could stimulate their metabolic activity. this report unveiled the potential of lb1f2, lb14f1, lb15f1, lb2f2, and lb3f2 isolates to be  used as natural barrier or competitive exclusion organism in the food processing  sector as well as a positive biofilm forming bacteria.

TI  == enhanced production of 3-hydroxypropionic acid from glycerol by modulation of glycerol metabolism in recombinant escherichia coli.
AB  == 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-hp) is a valuable biochemical with high potential for  bioplastic manufacturing. the endogenous glycerol metabolism and by-product formation pathway in escherichia coli were modulated to enhance 3-hp production from glycerol. double deletion of glpk and yqhd directed the glycerol flux to 3-hp biosynthesis and reduced the formation of 1,3-propanediol. since 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-hpa), a precursor of 3-hp, is toxic to cell growth, the gene encoding pseudomonas aeruginosa semialdehyde dehydrogenase (psaldh) highly active on 3-hpa was expressed in e. coli. finally, fed-batch culture of recombinant e. coli bl21star(de3) without glpk and yqhd, and expressing lactobacillus brevis dhab-dhar, and p. aeruginosa psaldh resulted in 57.3g/l 3-hp concentration, 1.59g/l-h productivity and 0.88g/g yield. in conclusion, modulation of the glycerol metabolism in combination with enhanced activity of 3-hpa dehydrogenation improved the production of 3-hp from glycerol.

TI  == antibiosis of vineyard ecosystem fungi against food-borne microorganisms.
AB  == fermentation extracts from fungi isolated from vineyard ecosystems were tested for antimicrobial activities against a set of test microorganisms, including five food-borne pathogens (staphylococcus aureus ep167, acinetobacter baumannii (clinically isolated), pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1, escherichia coli o157:h7 (cect 5947) and candida albicans my1055) and two probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus plantarum lch17 and lactobacillus brevis lch23). a total of 182 fungi was grown in eight different media, and the fermentation extracts were screened for antimicrobial activity. a total of 71 fungi produced extracts active against at least one pathogenic microorganism, but not against any probiotic bacteria. the gram-positive bacterium s. aureus ep167 was more susceptible to antimicrobial fungi broth extracts than gram-negative bacteria and pathogenic fungi. identification of active fungi based on internal transcribed spacer rrna sequence analysis revealed that species in the orders pleosporales, hypocreales and xylariales dominated. differences in antimicrobial selectivity were observed  among isolates from the same species. some compounds present in the active extracts were tentatively identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.  antimicrobial metabolites produced by vineyard ecosystem fungi may potentially limit colonization and spoilage of food products by food-borne pathogens, with minimal effect on probiotic bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of phenolic acids against commensal, probiotic and pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == phenolic acids (benzoic, phenylacetic and phenylpropionic acids) are the most abundant phenolic structures found in fecal water. as an approach towards the exploration of their action in the gut, this paper reports the antimicrobial activity of thirteen phenolic acids towards escherichia coli, lactobacillus spp., staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. the growth of e. coli atcc 25922 was inhibited by only four of the phenolic acids tested at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml, whereas pathogenic e. coli o157:h7 (cect 5947) was susceptible to ten of them. the genetically manipulated e. coli lpxc/tolc strain was highly susceptible to phenolic acids. the growth of lactobacilli (lactobacillus paraplantarum lch7, lactobacillus plantarum lch17, lactobacillus fermentum lph1, l. fermentum cect 5716, lactobacillus brevis lch23, and lactobacillus coryniformis cect 5711) and pathogens (s. aureus ep167 and c. albicans my1055) was also inhibited by phenolic acids, but to varying extents. only p. aeruginosa pao1 was not susceptible to any of the phenolic compounds tested. structure-activity relationships of phenolic acids and some of their diet precursors [(+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin] were established, based on multivariate analysis of microbial activities. the antimicrobial properties of phenolic acids reported in this paper might be relevant in vivo.

TI  == enumeration of bacterial cell numbers by amplified firefly bioluminescence without cultivation.
AB  == we recently developed a novel bioluminescent enzymatic cycling assay for atp and  amp with the concomitant use of firefly luciferase and pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (ppdk), where amp and pyrophosphate produced from atp by firefly luciferase were converted back into atp by ppdk. background luminescence derived  from contaminating atp and amp in the reagent was reduced using adenosine phosphate deaminase which degrades atp, adp, and amp, resulting in constant and highly amplified bioluminescence with low background luminescence. to detect bacterial cells without cultivation, we applied the above bioluminescent enzymatic cycling reagent to rapid microbe detection system. atp spots (0.31-5.0  amol/spot) at the level of a single bacterial cell were detected with 5 min signal integration, signifying that integrated luminescence was amplified 43 times in comparison to traditional atp bioluminescence. consequently, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and lactobacillus brevis in  beer were detected without cultivation. significant correlation was observed between the number of signal spots obtained using this novel system and the colony-forming units observed with the conventional colony-counting method (r(2)=0.973).

TI  == antimicrobial activity of neutralized extracellular culture filtrates of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a cultured indian milk product ('dahi').
AB  == neutralized extracellular culture filtrate obtained from isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbruecki ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus salivarius and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis from 'dahi' showed weak to moderate inhibition of staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, bacillus brevis, bacillus circulans, bacillus coagulans, bacillus laterosporus, bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa when tested by the diffusion agar well assay method. the effective minimum quantity of lactic culture filtrates required to obtain complete inhibition of an inoculum of 10(3)  cfu/ml of the bacteria tested was between 20 and 26% (vol/vol), as determined by  the agar incorporation method. neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of these lactic cultures added at a level of 10% in sterile, 10% reconstituted non-fat dry milk was able to either suppress or retard growth of selected bacterial cultures when incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. this study indicated  the antimicrobial activity of dahi and the potential of using neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of lactic acid bacteria in the biopreservation of  foods.

TI  == the deconjugation ability of bacteria isolated from the jejunal fluids in the blind loop syndrome with high 14co2 excretion--using the breath analysis technique and thin-layer chromatography.
AB  == five patients with blind loop syndrome (billroth ii) were examined by measuring 14co2 specific activity of expired breath samples taken at intervals after a meal containing glycine-1-14c cholate. the 5 patients tested showed a marked increase  of 14co2 specific activity. furthermore, the ability of deconjugation of bacteria isolated from the jejunal fluids in the efferent loop of these patients was tested by thin layer chromatography. the bacterial species identified from the samples were as follows: enterococcus, lactobacillus (l) buchneri, l. bifidus, l. brevis, eubacterium (e) lentum, bacteroides (b) vulgaricus, b. filamentosum, corynebacterium (c) granulosum, escherichia (e) coli, staphylococcus (s) epidermidis, and aerobacter (a) aerogenes. these species of bacteria, except e. coli and a. aerogenes, showed the deconjugation ability by which conjugated bile  acids in ox gall was hydrolyzed. administration of chloramphenicol (1g per day for 14 days orally divided doses) to the 5 patients reduced 14co2 specific activity significantly. on the other hand, 9 healthy men (control subjects) who were tested showed a flat curve, and 8 of the 9 had no growth of bacteria isolated from the jejunal fluids. the remaining healthy man showed an overgrowth  of e. coli and pseudomonas (p) aeruginosa, but the species did not have the ability of deconjugation. thus, we concluded that the patients with blind loop syndrome(billroth ii) had the bacterial overgrowth in the efferent loop that contained species with deconjugation ability, and, as a result the bacterial overgrowth contributed to causing abnormalities (increased deconjugation) in the  metabolism of bile acids in the small intestine. when the concentration of conjugated bile acids in the small intestine was reduced to levels below the critical micellar concentration by several factors, fat malabsorption and subsequent steatorrhea were induced (1,-4). furthermore, h. fromm and a. f. hofmann presented in vivo that the patients with blind loop syndrome had fat malabsorption and the patients who had a high 14co2 output after oral administration of glycine-1-14c cholate showed a low 14co2 output after oral administration of antibiotic drug (5,6). however, there has been no report on the deconjugation ability of bile acids of bacteria isolated from the jejunal fluids  in the efferent loop of patients with billroth ii who had positive breath tests.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == a study of colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) was conducted in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice. groups of germfree akr mice were swabbed with five bacterial and a single gastrointestinal yeast species: streptococcus faecalis. lactobacillus brevis. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, bacteroides fragilis var. vulgatus, and torulopsis sp. all species became established in the gut in 8 weeks. later these associated mice were divided and challenged by four graded doses of e. coli or p. aeruginosa. the presence of challenge organism was monitored specifically in the freshly voided fecal specimens of the challenged mice. escherichia coli colonized the gut of each mouse at each level up to 60 days post challenge. pseudomonas aeruginosa was completely eliminated from each mouse at each dose level after 30 days post challenge. evidence suggests that all six species were sufficient to prevent the  colonization of p. aeruginosa and not of e. coli in the gut of the gnotobiotic mice.
