TI  == novel accurate bacterial discrimination by maldi-time-of-flight ms based on ribosomal proteins coding in s10-spc-alpha operon at strain level s10-germs.
AB  == matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) is one of the most widely used mass-based approaches for bacterial identification and classification because of the simple sample preparation and extremely rapid analysis within a few minutes. to establish the accurate maldi-tof ms bacterial discrimination method at strain level, the ribosomal subunit proteins coded in the s10-spc-alpha operon, which encodes half of the ribosomal subunit protein and is highly conserved in eubacterial genomes, were selected as reliable biomarkers. this method, named the s10-germs method, revealed that the strains of genus pseudomonas were successfully identified and discriminated at species and strain levels, respectively; therefore, the s10-germs method was further applied to discriminate the pathovar of p. syringae. the eight selected biomarkers (l24, l30, s10, s12, s14, s16, s17, and s19) suggested the rapid discrimination of p. syringae at the strain (pathovar) level. the s10-germs method appears to be a powerful tool for rapid and reliable bacterial discrimination and successful phylogenetic characterization. in this article, an overview of the utilization of results from the s10-germs method is presented, highlighting the characterization of the lactobacillus casei group and discrimination of the bacteria of genera bacillus and sphingopyxis despite only two and one base difference in the 16s rrna gene sequence, respectively.
