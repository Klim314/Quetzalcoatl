TI  == reduction of vitamin k concentration by salivary bifidobacterium strains and their possible nutritional competition with porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == aims: to assess the possibility that bifidobacteria compete with porphyromonas gingivalis for their mutual growth factor vitamin k. this study also examined whether salivary bifidobacterium species decrease vitamin k concentration in the  growth medium. methods and results: sixty-five strains of bifidobacterium were obtained from 20 of 24 periodontally healthy subjects. bifidobacterium dentium was most frequently detected in the saliva of subjects, followed by bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium urinalis. the growth of most bifidobacterium isolates, except that of b. urinalis, was stimulated by vitamin k. moreover, the isolates were capable of decreasing vitamin k after incubation, which suggests that bifidobacteria compete with p. gingivalis for vitamin k. in a co-culture, a representative strain -b. adolescentis s2-1 - inhibited the growth of p. gingivalis if it was inoculated in the medium before p. gingivalis. conclusions: b. adolescentis s2-1 decreased vitamin k concentration and inhibited the growth of p. gingivalis by possibly competing for the growth factor. significance and impact of the study: salivary bifidobacteria may possess the potential to suppress the growth of p. gingivalis  by reducing the growth factor(s) in the environment.

TI  == rapid characterization of periodontal bacterial isolates by using fluorogenic substrate tests.
AB  == eighty-nine species of subgingival bacteria, represented by 121 reference strains and 892 patient isolates, including gram-negative, gram-positive, aerobic, facultatively anaerobic, microaerophilic, and anaerobic species, were characterized with a panel of fluorogenic, 4-methylumbelliferyl-linked substrate  tests. identifications of all patient isolates were confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) of whole-cell proteins relative to reference strains. characteristic profiles of positive fluorogenic reactions differentiated most of the species, including five porphyromonas species, six pigmenting and five nonpigmenting prevotella species, bacteroides forsythus, three capnocytophaga species, six actinomyces species, four propionibacterium species, and eight streptococcus species. two mannoside isomers differentiated actinomyces israelii and actinomyces gerencseriae. in addition to  porphyromonas gingivalis, b. forsythus, and capnocytophaga species, fusobacterium alocis, actinomyces odontolyticus, actinomyces meyeri, and bifidobacterium dentium were all positive for so-called trypsin-like activity. fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and campylobacter species were nonreactive with the carbohydrate-based substrates tested. fluorogenic substrate tests provided a sensitive and simple method for biochemical characterization that could presumptively identify to species level most subgingival isolates within 4 h. the method was ideal for rapidly obtaining  presumptive identifications of isolates prior to confirming identifications by definitive methods, such as sds-page.
