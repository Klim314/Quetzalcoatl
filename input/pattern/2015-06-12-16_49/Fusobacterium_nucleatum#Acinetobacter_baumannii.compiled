TI  - [Usefulness and limit of Gram staining smear examination].
AB  - Gram staining is one of the most simple and inexpensive methods for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infections. It yields results much faster than culture, and provides important data for the patient's treatment and prognosis. However, a difference exists in the quality and quantity of information yielded by Gram staining smears based on the experience and knowledge of those conducting the tests. Therefore, a risk of misdiagnosis based on the information obtained from Gram staining smears is also present. The Gram staining conditions and morphology of bacteria sometimes change due to antimicrobial therapy. Species of Gram-negative rods sometimes become filamentous and pleomorphic. Gram-positive bacteria may become gram variable (change in staining condition) after antimicrobial therapy. Even bacteria that are easy to mis-identify exist, because the morphology of bacteria may be similar. Enterococcus faecalis is a Gram-positive diplococcus, forming Gram-positive clustered cocci in specimens from blood culture bottles, resembling Streptococcus pneumoniae. Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative diplococcus in sputum, resembling Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis. Pasteurella multocida is a small-sized, Gram-negative short rod in the sputum, resembling Haemophilus influenzae. Prevotella intermedia is a small-sized, Gram-negative short rod in sputum, resembling Haemophilus influenzae. Capnocytophaga sp. is a Gram-negative fusiform (thin needle shape) rod present in clinical specimens, resembling Fusobacterium nucleatum.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological profiles of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive Brazilians undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy and HIV-seronegative Brazilians with chronic periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compares the periodontal clinical profile and the composition of the subgingival microbiota of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive and HIV-seronegative subjects with chronic periodontitis. METHODS: A total of 172 subjects were distributed into two HIV-seropositive groups (37 chronic periodontitis [H+CP+] and 35 periodontally healthy [H+CP-] individuals) and two HIV-seronegative groups (49 chronic periodontitis [H-CP+] and 51 periodontally healthy [H-CP-] subjects). Subgingival samples were collected from six sites with the deepest probing depth in the periodontitis groups and six random sites in the groups with periodontal health. All HIV-infected patients had undergone highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for at least 2 years. The presence and levels of 33 bacterial species were detected by DNA probes and the checkerboard method. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests were used to seek for significant differences among and between groups. RESULTS: H-CP+ patients showed significantly more periodontal destruction and inflammation than H+CP+ patients, whereas H+CP- subjects presented a greater percentage of sites with bleeding than H-CP- subjects (P <0.01). Patients who were HIV seronegative showed higher prevalence and levels of most bacterial species than HIV seropositive patients. Periodontal pathogens including Tannerella forsythensis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella nigrescens, Eubacterium nodatum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Selenomonas noxia were more frequently detected in H-CP+ subjects compared to H+CP+ and controls. In contrast, Enterococcus faecalis and Acinetobacter baumannii were more commonly found in HIV-infected than in non-HIV-infected subjects (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: Putative periodontal pathogens are more prevalent in the subgingival microbiota of HIV-seronegative patients with chronic periodontitis, whereas species not usually associated with periodontitis are detected in higher frequency in HIV-seropositive subjects under HAART.
