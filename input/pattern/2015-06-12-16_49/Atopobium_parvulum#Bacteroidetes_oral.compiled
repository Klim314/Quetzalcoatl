TI  - Molecular identification of bacteria on the tongue dorsum of subjects with and without halitosis.
AB  - AIM: Compare the microbial profiles on the tongue dorsum in patients with halitosis and control subjects in a UK population using culture-independent techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Halitosis patients were screened according to our recently developed recruitment protocol. Scrapings from the tongue dorsum were obtained for 12 control subjects and 20 halitosis patients. Bacteria were identified by PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. RESULTS: The predominant species found in the control samples were Lysobacter-type species, Streptococcus salivarius, Veillonella dispar, unidentified oral bacterium, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Atopobium parvulum and Veillonella atypica. In the halitosis samples, Lysobacter-type species, S. salivarius, Prevotella melaninogenica, unidentified oral bacterium, Prevotella veroralis and Prevotella pallens were the most commonly found species. For the control samples, 13-16 (4.7-5.8%) of 276 clones represented uncultured species, whereas in the halitosis samples, this proportion increased to 6.5-9.6% (36-53 of 553 clones). In the control samples, 22 (8.0%) of 276 clones represented potentially novel phylotypes, and in the halitosis samples, this figure was 39 (7.1%) of 553 clones. CONCLUSIONS: The microflora associated with the tongue dorsum is complex in both the control and halitosis groups, but several key species predominate in both groups.
TI  - New bacterial species associated with chronic periodontitis.
AB  - Recent investigations of the human subgingival oral flora based on ribosomal 16S  cloning and sequencing have shown many of the bacterial species present to be novel species or phylotypes. The purpose of the present investigation was to identify potential periodontal pathogens among these newly identified species and phylotypes. Species-specific ribosomal 16S primers for PCR amplification were developed for detection of new species. Associations with chronic periodontitis were observed for several new species or phylotypes, including uncultivated clones D084 and BH017 from the Deferribacteres phylum, AU126 from the Bacteroidetes phylum, Megasphaera clone BB166, clone X112 from the OP11 phylum, and clone I025 from the TM7 phylum, and the named species Eubacterium saphenum, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella denticola, and Cryptobacterium curtum. Species or phylotypes more prevalent in periodontal health included two uncultivated phylotypes, clone W090 from the Deferribacteres phylum and clone BU063 from the Bacteroidetes, and named species Atopobium rimae and Atopobium parvulum.
