TI  == effects of ensiling fermentation and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community in italian ryegrass, guinea grass, and whole-crop maize silages stored  at high moisture content.
AB  == the effects of storage period and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community were examined in italian ryegrass (ir), guinea grass (gg), and whole-crop maize (wm) silages. direct-cut forages were stored in a laboratory silo for 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 120 d without any additives; live counts, content  of fermentation products, and characteristics of the bacterial community were determined. 2,3-butanediol, acetic acid, and lactic acid were the dominant fermentation products in the ir, gg, and wm silages, respectively. the acetic acid content increased as a result of prolonged ensiling, regardless of the type  of silage crop, and the changes were distinctively visible from the beginning of  gg ensiling. pantoea agglomerans, rahnella aquatilis, and enterobacter sp. were the major bacteria in the ir silage, indicating that alcoholic fermentation may be due to the activity of enterobacteria. staphylococcus sciuri and bacillus pumilus were detected when ir silage was spoiled, whereas between aerobically stable and unstable silages, no differences were seen in the bacterial community  at silo opening. lactococcus lactis was a representative bacterium, although acetic acid was the major fermentation product in the gg silage. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and morganella morganii were suggested to be associated with the increase in acetic acid due to prolonged storage. enterobacter cloacae appeared when the gg silage was spoiled. in the wm silage, no distinctive changes due to prolonged ensiling were seen in the bacterial community. throughout the ensiling, weissella paramesenteroides, weissella confusa, and klebsiella pneumoniae were present in addition to l. plantarum, l. brevis, and l. lactis. upon deterioration, acetobacter pasteurianus, klebsiella variicola, enterobacter hormaechei, and bacillus gibsonii were detected. these results demonstrate the diverse bacterial community that evolves during ensiling  and aerobic spoilage of ir, gg, and wm silages.

TI  == plantaricin ld1: a bacteriocin produced by food isolate of lactobacillus plantarum ld1.
AB  == plantaricin ld1, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum ld1, was characterized for biochemical and antimicrobial properties. bacteriocin showed stability at high temperatures (100 degrees c for 20 min and 121 degrees c for 15 min under 15 psi pressure), in a ph range of 2.0-8.0 and also in the presence of  organic solvents, surfactants and detergents. the crude preparation was not affected by catalase, amylase and lipase but activity was reduced in the presence of pepsin, trypsin and proteinase k showing proteinaceous nature of the compound. the molecular weight of bacteriocin was found to be approximately 6.5 kda, and antimicrobial activity was confirmed by bioassay. it inhibited not only related strains but also other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria such as lactobacillus curvatus nrrl b-4562, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis nrrl b-1821, enterococcus faecium nrrl b-2354, enterobacter cloacae nrrl b-14298, micrococcus  luteus, staphylococcus aureus, urogenic escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri and vibrio sp. these properties of plantaricin ld1 suggest its applications not only in food safety but in therapeutics as well.

TI  == hanseniaspora opuntiae, saccharomyces cerevisiae, lactobacillus fermentum, and acetobacter pasteurianus predominate during well-performed malaysian cocoa bean box fermentations, underlining the importance of these microbial species for a successful cocoa bean fermentation process.
AB  == two spontaneous malaysian cocoa bean box fermentations (one farm, two plantation  plots) were investigated. physical parameters, microbial community dynamics, yeast and bacterial species diversity [mainly lactic acid bacteria (lab) and acetic acid bacteria (aab)], and metabolite kinetics were monitored, and chocolates were produced from the respective fermented dry cocoa beans. similar microbial growth and metabolite profiles were obtained for the two fermentations. low concentrations of citric acid were found in the fresh pulp, revealing low acidity of the raw material. the main end-products of the catabolism of the pulp  substrates glucose, fructose, and citric acid by yeasts, lab, and aab were ethanol, lactic acid, acetic acid, and/or mannitol. hanseniaspora opuntiae, lactobacillus fermentum, and acetobacter pasteurianus were the prevalent species  of the two fermentations. saccharomyces cerevisiae, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus pentosus, and acetobacter ghanensis were also found during the mid-phase of the fermentation processes. leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides and acetobacter senegalensis were among the prevailing species during the initial phase of the fermentations. tatumella saanichensis and enterobacter sp. were present in the beginning of the fermentations and they could be responsible for the degradation of citric acid and/or the production of gluconic acid and lactic  acid, respectively. the presence of facultative heterofermentative lab during the fermentations caused a high production of lactic acid. finally, as these fermentations were carried out with high-quality raw material and were characterised by a restricted microbial species diversity, resulting in successfully fermented dry cocoa beans and good chocolates produced thereof, it is likely that the prevailing species h. opuntiae, s. cerevisiae, lb. fermentum,  and a. pasteurianus were responsible for it.

TI  == changes in the bacterial community and composition of fermentation products during ensiling of wilted italian ryegrass and wilted guinea grass silages.
AB  == to gain further insights into temperate and tropical grass ensiling, fermentation products and bacterial communities were examined at both the initial and late stages of ensiling of wilted italian ryegrass and wilted guinea grass silages. 2,3-butanediol and ethanol fermentation were observed in wilted italian ryegrass  silage. enterobacteria such as rahnella sp. and enterobacter sp. may have been involved in fermentation; however, alcohol production was intensified after the silage enterobacterial community overwhelmed the pre-ensiled enterobacterial community. pediococcus spp. appeared in silage stored for 4 months, when a significant increase in lactic acid content was seen compared with that at 2 months. prolonged storage enhanced acetic acid fermentation in wilted guinea grass silage. the disappearance of enterococcus sulfureus and appearance of lactobacillus plantarum may have been associated with the increased acetic acid content. although many species of enterobacteria were found in common between the pre-ensiled crop and silages of italian ryegrass and guinea grass, marked differences were seen in the type of fermentation from the initial stages. these  results indicate that the bacterial community of pre-ensiled crops may be immediately replaced by one that is adapted to ensiling environments, although metabolic changes may continue over the course of ensiling.

TI  == a multiphasic approach for the identification of endophytic bacterial in strawberry fruit and their potential for plant growth promotion.
AB  == this study used a multiphasic approach, characterized by the simultaneous use of  culture-dependent and culture-independent methods, to investigate endophytic bacterial communities in strawberry (fragaria ananassa) fruit. a total of 92 bacterial endophytes were isolated and initially grouped by their repetitive extragenic palindromic (rep)-pcr banding pattern and biochemical features. phylogenetic analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequences of 45 representatives showed that the isolates belonged to the species bacillus subtilis (eight isolates), bacillus sp. (seven isolates), enterobacter sp. (seven isolates), enterobacter ludwigii (six isolates), lactobacillus plantarum (six isolates), pseudomonas sp.  (five isolates), pantoea punctata (three isolates), and curtobacterium citreum (three isolates). nucleic acids were extracted from the strawberry fruit and subjected to 16s rrna gene directed polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (16s rrna pcr-dgge). the species b. subtilis, enterobacter sp., and pseudomonas sp. were detected both by isolation and dgge. the dgge fingerprints of total bacterial dna did not exhibit bands corresponding to several of the representative species isolated in the extinction dilution (l. plantarum, c. citreum, and p. punctata). in contrast, bands in the dgge profile that were identified as relatives of arthrobacter sp. and one uncultivable erythrobacter sp. were not recovered by cultivation techniques. after isolation,  the nitrogen fixation ability and the in vitro production of indole-3-acetic acid (iaa) equivalents and siderophores were evaluated. a high percentage of isolates  were found to possess the ability to produce siderophores and iaa equivalents; however, only a few isolates belonging to the genera pseudomonas and enterobacter showed the ability to fix nitrogen. plant growth promotion was evaluated under greenhouse conditions and revealed the ability of the bacillus strains to enhance the number of leaves, shoot length, root dry weight, and shoot dry weight. the activity of the bacterial isolate identified as b. subtilis na-108 exerted the greatest influence on strawberry growth and showed a 42.8% increase in number of  leaves, 15.26% for high shoot, 43.5% increase in root dry weight, and a 77% increase in shoot dry weight when compared with untreated controls.

TI  == bacterial species associated with sound and botrytis-infected grapes from a greek vineyard.
AB  == grape bacterial microbiota plays central roles in the quality of grapes and wine, yet its diversity remains poorly described. in the present study, bacterial species associated with sound and botrytis-infected grapes of two cultivars originating from the same vineyard were assessed. isolates were identified by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) and sequence analysis of partial 16s rrna gene. comparable counts were recorded between botrytis-infected  and sound grape samples. in all cases, the majority of isolates belonged to different species of enterobacteriaceae. the dominant species in the vineyard was klebsiella oxytoca that was found in different combinations with citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., erwinia sp., pantoea dispersa, tatumella ptyseos or  other species. in fermenting musts, those populations declined while other species evolved, like lactobacillus plantarum and enterobacter ludwigii. populations in botrytised samples persisted longer during spontaneous fermentations. present study suggests that bacterial diversity on grapes may be wider than previously described.

TI  == taxonomic structure and stability of the bacterial community in belgian sourdough ecosystems as assessed by culture and population fingerprinting.
AB  == a total of 39 traditional sourdoughs were sampled at 11 bakeries located throughout belgium which were visited twice with a 1-year interval. the taxonomic structure and stability of the bacterial communities occurring in these traditional sourdoughs were assessed using both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. a total of 1,194 potential lactic acid bacterium (lab) isolates were tentatively grouped and identified by repetitive element sequence-based pcr, followed by sequence-based identification using 16s rrna and  phes genes from a selection of genotypically unique lab isolates. in parallel, all samples were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of v3-16s rrna gene amplicons. in addition, extensive metabolite target analysis of  more than 100 different compounds was performed. both culturing and dgge analysis showed that the species lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, lactobacillus paralimentarius, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus pontis dominated the  lab population of belgian type i sourdoughs. in addition, dgge band sequence analysis demonstrated the presence of acetobacter sp. and a member of the erwinia/enterobacter/pantoea group in some samples. overall, the culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches each exhibited intrinsic limitations in assessing bacterial lab diversity in belgian sourdoughs. irrespective of the lab biodiversity, a large majority of the sugar and amino acid metabolites were detected in all sourdough samples. principal component-based analysis of biodiversity and metabolic data revealed only little  variation among the two samples of the sourdoughs produced at the same bakery. the rare cases of instability observed could generally be linked with variations  in technological parameters or differences in detection capacity between culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches. within a sampling interval  of 1 year, this study reinforces previous observations that the bakery environment rather than the type or batch of flour largely determines the development of a stable lab population in sourdoughs.

TI  == usefulness of length heterogeneity-pcr for monitoring lactic acid bacteria succession during maize ensiling.
AB  == the use of length-heterogeneity pcr was explored to monitor lactic acid bacteria  succession during ensiling of maize. bacterial diversity was studied during the fermentation of 30-day-old maize in optimal and spoilage-simulating conditions. a length heterogeneity pcr profile database of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the silage and identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing was established. although interoperonic 16s rrna gene length polymorphisms were detected in some isolates,  strain analysis showed that most of the lactic acid bacteria species thriving in  silage could be discriminated by this method. the length heterogeneity pcr profiles of bacterial communities during maize fermentation were compared with those on a database. under optimal fermentation conditions all the ecological indices of bacterial diversity, richness and evenness, deduced from community profiles, increased until day thirteen of fermentation and then decreased to the  initial values. pediococcus and weissella dominated, especially in the first days of fermentation. lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis and lactobacillus brevis were mainly found after six days of fermentation. a peak corresponding to lactobacillus plantarum was present in all the fermentation phases, but was only  a minor fraction of the population. unsuitable fermentation conditions and withered maize leaves in the presence of oxygen and water excess caused an enrichment of enterococcus sp. and enterobacter sp.

TI  == sensorial and microbial effects of gaseous ozone on fresh scad (trachurus trachurus).
AB  == the bactericidal activity of gaseous ozone was investigated using a commercial ozone generator. five species of fish bacteria, pseudomonas putida, shewanella putrefaciens, brochothrix thermosphacta, enterobacter sp. and lactobacillus plantarum, were inoculated on agar surfaces and exposed to different ozonation times in a gas chamber. results showed ozone in relatively low concentrations (<  0.27 x 10(-3) g l-1) was an effective bactericide of vegetative cells of the five fish bacteria. the age of the cell culture was shown to influence the cell response following exposure. survival rate was not linearly related to ozonation  time, but exhibited biphasic death over an extended period. similar bactericidal  effects were observed on fish skin treated with ozone daily in the laboratory, with decreases of 1.0 log cfu cm-2 for the micro-organisms studied. whole fish treated daily in the laboratory using a commercial ozone generator showed improved scores for sensory analyses compared with the controls. the results were statistically significant. fish treated on board ships were also analysed for microbiological and sensory changes. controls were obtained from a similar vessel without the ozone facility in the hold. similar trends to those recorded in the laboratory for the microbiological and sensory results on ozonated fish were observed.

TI  == [behavior of some microorganisms cultivated in the presence of irradiated maize starch].
AB  == the bactericidal effect of water soluble radiolysis products of maize starch on escherichia coli cultures declines when the initial population grows. this toxicity varies with the culture environment and the bacterial species: bacillus  subtilis, lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus faecalis, enterobacter sp. moreover, for the eucaryote cell saccharomyces cerevisiae, wild strain or muting  "small colonies", only the generating time is altered by the active parts of radiolysis products. the results are analysed with regard to the hypothesis that  the hydrogen peroxide is responsible for this toxicity.
