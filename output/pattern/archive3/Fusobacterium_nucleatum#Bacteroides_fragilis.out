essential oils and isolated compounds from lippia alba leaves and flowers: antimicrobial activity and osteoclast apoptosis.
in the present study, essential oils extracted from the leaves and flowers of lippia alba (mill.) n.e.br. (l. alba) were analyzed for their antimicrobial activity and their effects on osteoclasts. the periodontal pathogens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a. actinomycetemcomitans; atcc 43717), fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum; atcc 25586) and porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis); atcc 33277) were used in antimicrobial activity assays for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc), whereas bacteroides fragilis (b. fragilis; atcc 25285) was used as the control microorganism. osteoclast (oc) apoptosis was assessed by tunel assay and fas receptor expression was detected by immunocytochemistry. the analysis of antimicrobial activity revealed that p. gingivalis had the lowest mic values, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans had the highest. l. alba essential oils were found to be toxic to human cells, although the compounds, carvone, limonene and citral, were non-toxic and induced apoptosis in the ocs. this study demonstrates that l. alba has potential biotechnological application in dentistry. in fact periodontal disease has a multifactorial etiology, and the immune response to microbial challenge leads to osteoclast activation and the resorption of the alveolar bone, resulting in tooth loss.
inhibitory effects of various micro-organisms on the growth of helicobacter pylori.
aims: to examine the in vitro influence of various bacteria species on helicobacter pylori (hp) growth. methods and results: the effects of 29 micro-organisms on 31 hp strains were determined using two modified 'cross streak' methods. staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, morganella morganii, serratia marcescens, bacteroides fragilis, fusobacterium nucleatum and clostridium difficile showed the strongest inhibition. the inhibitory effects varied, depending on the bacteria spp. and hp strains, and were method dependent. the caga status of hp strains did not correlate with the extent of inhibition. conclusions: helicobacter pylori is inhibited by a significant number of commensal bacteria species as well as opportunistic human pathogens. the success and progress of hp infection may be influenced by the bacterial flora present, while the difficulty in cultivating hp from the oral mucosa and faeces may be the result of antagonistic bacterial interaction. significance and impact of the study: this study provides valuable data on the sensitivity of hp to a variety of intestinal and oral commensals as well as opportunistic human pathogens. hp's varying pathogenicity and the specific localization of infection may be the result of these sensitivities. these results can also serve as a basis for further studies to identify the inhibitory substances and make them available for therapeutic use.
["in vitro" activity of ten antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria. a collaborative study, 1999-2002].
the antimicrobial activity of ampicillin, ampicillin-sulbactam, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, imipenem, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, clindamycin, metronidazole, and azitromycin was assesed against 166 strains of anaerobic bacteria recovered from eight hospitals in buenos aires. the strains studied were bacteroides fragilis group (65), fusobacterium spp. (26), prevotella spp. (21), porphyromonas spp. (10), clostridium difficile (10), other clostridia (12), and gram-positive cocci (22). the mics were determined by the agar dilution method according to nccls document m11-a5. metronidazole and piperacillin-tazobactam were the most active antimicrobial agents tested and exhibited mic90 values of < or = 2 microg/ml and < or = 4 microg/ml against gram-negative organisms, and < or = 2 microg/ml, and < or = 8 microg/ml against gram-positive organisms, respectively. among beta-lactams the activity against gram-negative rods was in the following order: imipenem > piperacillin > cefoxitin > ceftriaxone > ampicillin. among the gram-positive bacteria the decreased activity was: piperacillin > imipenem > cefoxitin > ceftriaxone > ampicillin. the majority of the species studied showed different degrees of resistance to clindamycin and azitromycin. nevertheless, 90% of fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas spp. isolates were inhibited by 0.125 mg/ml of clindamycin and azitromycin, respectively.
in vitro activity of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, against anaerobic bacteria.
the activity of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, and flomoxef against 322 recent clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. a fastidious facultative anaerobe, gardnerella vaginalis, was also studied. fk037 inhibited 90% of isolates of peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, clostridium perfringens, mobiluncus spp., g. vaginalis, and porphyromonas gingivalis at < or = 0.78 micrograms/ml. the mics of fk037 for 50 and 90% of bacteroides fragilis isolates were 25 and > 200 micrograms/ml, respectively; the activity of fk037 was comparable to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime but lower than that of flomoxef. the activity of fk037 against fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium varium, and bilophila wadsworthia decreased when inoculum size was increased from 10(6) to 10(8) cfu/ml. little influence of inoculum size on the activity of fk037 was observed for other isolates tested. medium ph affected the activity of fk037 against f. varium (mics at phs 5 and 7, 3.13 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively) and bacteroides gracilis (mics at phs 5 and 7, 12.5 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively) but not against other organisms tested. fk037 was less resistant than flomoxef to hydrolysis by beta-lactamase group 2e derived from b. fragilis gai 0558 and gai 10150.
comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than bacteroides fragilis.
to assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7 gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. for comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against prevotella oralis, prevotella buccalis, prevotella bivia, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, bacteroides corporis, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium naviforme and propionibacterium acnes. prevotella oris, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and prevotella denticola, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides pneumosintes, and peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. strains of veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptostreptococcus magnus showed mics of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. the results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving bacteroides fragilis.
biotransformation of 1-nitropyrene in intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
mutagenic nitroaromatic compounds have recently been found in photocopies, urban  atmosphere, automobile exhaust and wastewater. 1-nitropyrene (1-np) is readily formed when pyrene, ubiquitous in the environment, is exposed to nitrogen dioxide in the urban atmosphere or in automobile exhaust, and is highly mutagenic, inducing 449 his+ revertants/plate/nmol from salmonella typhimurium strain ta98 in the absence of s9 fraction in the salmonella-microsome test. it is possible to swallow sputum or some food containing 1-np and it would come into contact with the normal bacterial flora. we determined the 1-np nitroreductase activity in environmental and laboratory bacterial strains. we found that the mutagenicity of 1-np mixed with the feces of a healthy man or a culture of anaerobic bacteria was decreased. the product proved to be 1-aminopyrene (1-ap), based on its fluorescence spectrum, its mass spectrum, and its characteristic thin layer chromatographic and high performance liquid chromatographic patterns. the 1-np nitroreductase activity of aerobic bacteria was low, but crude extracts from the anaerobic bacteria, i.e., bacteroides fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, fusobacterium mortiferum, f. nucleatum, clostridium perfringens, c. sporogenes, bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, eubacterium lentum, e. limosum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, all easily converted 1-np to 1-ap and proportionally decreased the mutagenic activity of 1-np.
in vitro activity of tiamulin (81.723 hfu), a new pleuromulin derivative, against clinically significant anaerobes.
the susceptibility of more than 40 strains of gram-negative and gram-positive anaerobes to tiamulin (sandoz 81.723 hfu), a new pleuromulin (pleuromutilin) derivative, was determined by broth dilution and agar dilution tests. the influences of density of the inoculum upon mics was studied by a specially designed pour plate-technique. bacteroides fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. splanchnicus, b. oralis, b. asaccharolyticus, b. melaninogenicus, fusobacterium fusiforme (f. nucleatum), sphaerophorus necrophorus, clostridium perfringens, c. fallax, propionibacterium acnes and several species of peptococcaceae showed broth dilution mics of 0.03 similar to 1 microgram/ml. members of b. thetaiotaomicron, b. distasonis and s. freundii (f. mortiferum) were inhibited by 8 similar to 32 microgram/ml and 2 strains of s. varius had a broth dilution mic of 256 microgram/ml. with most strains, the agar dilution mics were 2 similar to 4 similar to 8 times the broth dilution mics. in pour plate-tests, the mics were not considerably influenced influenced by varying initial concentrations of viable cells. with most anaerobes, the mbcs of tiamulin were more than 100-fold higher than the mics. the results obtained indicated that, apart from s. varius, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. distasonis and s. freundii (f. mortiferum), members of 16 other anaerobic species including b. fragilis were without exception sensitive to tiamulin.
