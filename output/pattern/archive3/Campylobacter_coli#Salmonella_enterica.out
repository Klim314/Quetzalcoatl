antibiotic susceptibility and prevalence of foodborne pathogens in poultry meat in romania.
introduction: the occurrence of pathogenic strains in poultry meat is of growing  concern in romania. another problem found on a global level is the continuous increase of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from food. this study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of pathogenic bacteria in poultry carcasses obtained in romania in 2012-2013 and to reveal the most prevalent patterns of antimicrobial resistance in the isolated strains. methodology: a total of 144 broiler chicken carcasses were evaluated according to classical microbiological methods. the dna was extracted from the bacterial colonies and the resistance genes were identified by pcr. results: in 2012, 47.2% of the samples revealed at least one of the following bacteria: campylobacter jejuni (9.72%; n = 7), salmonella enterica serotype enteritidis (4.17%; n = 3), listeria monocytogenes (15.28%; n = 11), and escherichia coli (16.67%; n = 12). in 2013, the number of positive samples of pathogenic bacteria decreased, although campylobacter jejuni was isolated in a higher percentage (20.8% vs. 9.72%). the percentage of multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacteria was high (23%); the most prevalent pattern included resistance to tetracycline, sulfonamides, and quinolones/fluoroquinolones. all the resistant salmonella and e. coli strains were tested for the presence of characteristic resistance genes (kn, bla(tem), teta, tetb, tetg, dfria, aada1a, sul) and revealed that these isolates represent an important reservoir in the spread of this phenomenon. conclusions: our findings suggest that romania urgently needs an integrated surveillance system within the entire chain, for drug-resistant pathogens isolated from poultry meat.
inhibitory spectra and modes of antimicrobial action of gallotannins from mango kernels (mangifera indica l.).
this study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-o-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. the mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were gram-negative bacteria. the mics of gallotannins against bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, clostridium botulinum, campylobacter jejuni, listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. the use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of s. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. supplementation of lb medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of s. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. hepta-o-galloylglucose sensitized lactobacillus plantarum tmw1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (mdr) transporter hora. carbohydrate metabolism of lactococcus lactis mg1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-o-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. in conclusion, the inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.
survival of bacterial pathogens during the thermophilic anaerobic digestion of biowaste: laboratory experiments and in situ validation.
anaerobic digestion is continually gaining importance for the processing of the organic fraction of municipal solid wastes. although methods for studying the survival of pathogen exist, these methods often need adaptations, are expensive, time consuming or generally not well suited for the harsh conditions within an anaerobic digestion system. in the present study we investigated the applicability of commercially available, mechanically stable and inexpensive pathogen carriers to validate in situ pathogen inhibition within a 750,000l thermophilic, bio-waste treating anaerobic digester. none of the pathogens investigated (listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, and campylobacter jejuni) was capable of survival under the conditions of the biogas reactor for more than 24 h indicating that the temperature and physico-chemical properties of the sludge of the fermenter were effective in inhibiting the survival of these microorganisms.
isolation and purification of enterocin e-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
evaluation of bacterial and protozoal contamination of commercially available raw meat diets for dogs.
objective: to evaluate bacterial and protozoal contamination of commercially available raw meat diets for dogs. design: prospective longitudinal study. sample population: 240 samples from 20 raw meat diets for dogs (containing beef, lamb, chicken, or turkey), 24 samples from 2 dry dog foods, and 24 samples from 2 canned dog foods. procedure: each product was purchased commercially on 4 dates approximately 2 months apart. three samples from each product at each sampling period were evaluated via bacterial culture for non-type-specific escherichia coli (ntsec), salmonella enterica, and campylobacter spp. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on selected isolates. polymerase chain reaction assays were used to detect dna from cryptosporidium spp, neospora spp, and toxoplasma spp in samples obtained in the third and fourth sampling periods. results: one hundred fifty-three of 288 (53%) samples were contaminated with ntsec. both raw and prepared foods contained ntsec during at least 1 culture period. salmonella enterica was recovered from 17 (5.9%) samples, all of which were raw meat products. campylobacter spp was not isolated from any samples. in 91 of 288 (31.6%) samples, there was no gram-negative bacterial growth before enrichment and in 48 of 288 (16.7%) samples, there was no aerobic bacterial growth before enrichment. susceptibility phenotypes were variable. cryptosporidium spp dna was detected in 3 samples. conclusions and clinical relevance: bacterial contamination is common in commercially available raw meat diets, suggesting that there is a risk of foodborne illness in dogs fed these diets as well possible risk for humans associated with the dogs or their environments.
a novel action of the proton pump inhibitor rabeprazole and its thioether derivative against the motility of helicobacter pylori.
the motility of helicobacter pylori was maximum at 37 degrees c and at ph 6. a newly developed proton pump inhibitor, rabeprazole (rpz), and its thioether derivative (rpz-th) markedly inhibited the motility of h. pylori. the concentrations of the drug necessary to inhibit 50% of the motility were 0.25, 16, 16, and >64 microgram/ml for rpz-th, rpz, lansoprazole, and omeprazole, respectively. no such inhibitory effects were observed with h(2) blockers or anti-h. pylori agents. the motilities of campylobacter jejuni and c. coli-but not those of vibrio cholerae o1 and o139, vibrio parahaemolyticus, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and proteus mirabilis-were also inhibited. prolonged incubation with rpz or rpz-th inhibited bacterial growth of only h. pylori, except for a turbid colony mutant. the results indicate that rpz and rpz-th have a characteristic inhibitory effect against the motility of h. pylori (spiral-shaped bacteria), which is distinguished from that against bacterial growth.
