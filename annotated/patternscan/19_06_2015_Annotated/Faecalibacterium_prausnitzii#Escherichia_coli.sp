TI  == intestinal microbiota and allergic diseases: a systematic review.
AB  == evidence suggests that possible imbalances in intestinal microbiota composition may be implicated in the occurrence of allergic diseases. although several studies published until 2006 indicated a correlation between microbiota composition and allergic symptoms, it has not been possible to distinguish protective microorganisms from those associated with increased risk of allergic diseases. therefore, the objective of this study was to review the studies published since 2007 that address the intestinal microbiota in allergic diseases. twenty-one studies were identified after excluding those that performed a clinical intervention before stool collection. in the early microbiota of children who later developed allergies, lower bacterial diversity was observed, with a predominance of firmicutes; a higher count of bacteroidaceae; a higher prevalence of the anaerobic bacteria bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum, and  bifidobacterium longum; and a lower prevalence of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, and lactobacillus. in the microbiota of allergic children whose intestinal microbiota was assessed at the onset of allergic symptoms, there was a higher count of bacteroides; a lower count of akkermansia muciniphila, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and clostridium; a higher prevalence of b. adolescentis; a lower prevalence of b. catenulatum and staphylococcus aureus; and a lower bacterial diversity.

TI  == identification of metabolic signatures linked to anti-inflammatory effects of faecalibacterium prausnitzii.
AB  == faecalibacterium prausnitzii is an anti-inflammatory commensal bacterium identified on the basis of human clinical data. the mechanisms underlying its beneficial effects are still unknown. gnotobiotic mice harboring f. prausnitzii (a2-165) and escherichia coli (k-12 jm105) were subjected to 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (tnbs)-induced acute colitis. the inflammatory colitis scores and a gas chromatography-time of flight (gc/tof) mass spectrometry-based metabolomic profile were monitored in blood, ileum, cecum, colon, and feces in gnotobiotic mice. the potential anti-inflammatory metabolites were tested in vitro. we obtained stable e. coli and f. prausnitzii-diassociated  mice in which e. coli primed the gastrointestinal tract (git), allowing a durable and stable establishment of f. prausnitzii. the disease activity index, histological scores, myeloperoxidase (mpo) activity, and serum cytokine levels were significantly lower in the presence of f. prausnitzii after tnbs challenge.  the protective effect of f. prausnitzii against colitis was correlated to its implantation level and was linked to overrepresented metabolites along the git and in serum. among 983 metabolites in git samples and serum, 279 were assigned to known chemical reactions. some of them, belonging to the ammonia (alpha-ketoglutarate), osmoprotective (raffinose), and phenolic (including anti-inflammatory shikimic and salicylic acids) pathways, were associated with a  protective effect of f. prausnitzii, and the functional link was established in vitro for salicylic acid. we show for the first time that f. prausnitzii is a highly active commensal bacterium involved in reduction of colitis through in vivo modulation of metabolites along the git and in the peripheral blood. importance: inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd) are characterized by low proportions of f. prausnitzii in the gut microbiome. this commensal bacterium exhibits anti-inflammatory effects through still unknown mechanisms. stable monoassociated rodents are actually not a reproducible model to decipher f. prausnitzii protective effects. we propose a new gnotobiotic rodent model providing mechanistic clues. in this model, f. prausnitzii exhibits protective effects against an acute colitis and a protective metabolic profile is linked to  its presence along the digestive tract. we identified a molecule, salicylic acid, directly involved in the protective effect of f. prausnitzii. targeting its metabolic pathways could be an attractive therapeutic strategy in ibd.

TI  == dietary supplementation with soybean oligosaccharides increases short-chain fatty acids but decreases protein-derived catabolites in the intestinal luminal content of weaned huanjiang mini-piglets.
AB  == the improvement of gut health and function with prebiotic supplements after weaning is an active area of research in pig nutrition. the present study was conducted to test the working hypothesis that medium-term dietary supplementation with soybean oligosaccharides (sbos) can affect the gut ecosystem in terms of microbiota composition, luminal bacterial short-chain fatty acid and ammonia concentrations, and intestinal expression of genes related to intestinal immunity and barrier function. ten huanjiang mini-piglets, weaned at 21 days of age, were  randomly assigned to 2 groups. each group received a standard diet containing either dietary supplementation with 0.5% corn starch (control group) or 0.5% sbos (experimental group). the results showed that dietary supplementation with sbos increased the diversity of intestinal microflora and elevated (p < .05) the numbers of some presumably beneficial intestinal bacteria (e.g., bifidobacterium  sp, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, fusobacterium prausnitzii, and roseburia). soybean oligosaccharide supplementation also increased the concentration of short-chain fatty acid in the intestinal lumen, and it reduced (p < .05) the numbers of bacteria with pathogenic potential (e.g., escherichia coli, clostridium, and streptococcus) and the concentration of several protein-derived  catabolites (e.g., isobutyrate, isovalerate, and ammonia). in addition, sbos supplementation increased (p < .05) expression of zonula occludens 1 messenger rna, and it decreased (p < .05) expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1beta, and interleukin 8 messenger rna in the ileum and colon. these  findings suggest that sbos supplementation modifies the intestinal ecosystem in weaned huanjiang mini-piglets and has potentially beneficial effects on the gut.

TI  == intestinal dysbiosis: novel mechanisms by which gut microbes trigger and prevent  disease.
AB  == new research has identified specific intestinal colonizing microbes that can have significant influence on health and disease. evidence is reviewed supporting an association between fusobacterium nucleatum and colon cancer and for a protective role of faecalibacterium prausnitzii in inflammatory bowel disease, of escherichia coli nissle 1917 in acute intestinal inflammation, of bifidobacterium infantis in neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis, and of akkermansia muciniphila in obesity and diabetes. these novel bacteria are clinically relevant and present opportunities for more focused diagnosis of colon cancer and prevention of common diseases.

TI  == mucosa-associated faecalibacterium prausnitzii and escherichia coli co-abundance  can distinguish irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease phenotypes.
AB  == background: crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc) diagnosis requires comprehensive examination of the patient. faecalibacterium prausnitzii and escherichia coli have been reported as representatives of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) dysbiosis. the aim was to determine whether or not quantification of these species can be used as a complementary tool either for diagnostic or prognostic purposes. methods: mucosa-associated f. prausnitzii and e. coli abundance was determined in 28 controls (h), 45 cd, 28 uc patients and 10 irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) subjects by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) and the f. prausnitzii-e. coli index (f-e index) was calculated. species abundances were normalized to total bacteria and human cells. data was analyzed taking into account patients' phenotype and most relevant clinical characteristics. results: ibd patients had lower f. prausnitzii abundance than h  and ibs (p<0.001). cd patients showed higher e. coli counts than h and uc patients (p<0.001). the f-e index discriminated between h, cd and uc patients, and even between disease phenotypes that are usually difficult to distinguish as  ileal-cd (i-cd) from ileocolonic-cd and colonic-cd from extensive colitis. e. coli increased in active cd patients, and remission in i-cd patients was compromised by high abundance of this species. treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor (tnf) alpha diminished e. coli abundance in i-cd whereas none of the treatments counterbalanced f. prausnitzii depletion. conclusion: f. prausnitzii and e. coli are useful indicators to assist in ibd phenotype classification. the  abundance of these species could also be used as a supporting prognostic tool in  i-cd patients. our data indicates that current medication does not restore the levels of these two species to those found in a healthy gut.

TI  == faecalibacterium prausnitzii supernatant improves intestinal barrier function in  mice dss colitis.
AB  == objective. the intestinal microbiota plays a substantial role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). faecalibacterium prausnitzii (fp) is underrepresented in ibd patients and have been suggested to have anti-inflammatory effects in mice. increased intestinal permeability is common in ibd but the relationship between fp and intestinal barrier function has not been  investigated. our aim was to study treatment with fp supernatant on intestinal barrier function in a dextran sodium sulfate (dss) colitis mice model. material and methods. c57bl/6 mice received 3% dss in tap water ad libitum during five days to induce colitis. from day 3 the mice received a daily gavage with fp supernatant or broth during seven days. ileum and colon were mounted in ussing chambers for permeability studies with (51)cr-edta and escherichia coli k-12. colon was saved for western blot analyses of tight junction proteins. results. dss-treated mice showed significant weight loss and colon shortening. gavage with fp supernatant resulted in a quicker recovery after dss treatment and less extensive colonic shortening. ileal mucosa of dss mice showed a significant increase in (51)cr-edta-passage compared to controls. (51)cr-edta passage was significantly decreased in mice receiving fp supernatant. no significant differences were observed in passage of e. coli k12. western blots showed a trend to increased claudin-1 and claudin-2 expressions in dss mice. conclusions. supernatant of fp enhances the intestinal barrier function by affecting paracellular permeability, and may thereby attenuate the severity of dss-induced  colitis in mice. these findings suggest a potential role of fp in the treatment of ibd.

TI  == cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) allelic variants relate to shifts in faecal microbiota of cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  == introduction: in this study we investigated the effects of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) gene variants on the composition of faecal microbiota, in patients affected by cystic fibrosis (cf). cftr mutations (f508del is the most common) lead to a decreased secretion of chloride/water, and to mucus sticky secretions, in pancreas, respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. intestinal manifestations are underestimated in cf, leading to ileum meconium at  birth, or small bowel bacterial overgrowth in adult age. methods: thirty-six cf patients, fasting and under no-antibiotic treatment, were cftr genotyped on both  alleles. faecal samples were subjected to molecular microbial profiling through temporal temperature gradient electrophoresis and species-specific pcr. ecological parameters and multivariate algorithms were employed to find out if cftr variants could be related to the microbiota structure. results: patients were classified by two different criteria: 1) presence/absence of f508del mutation; 2) disease severity in heterozygous and homozygous f508del patients. we found that homozygous-f508del and severe cf patients exhibited an enhanced dysbiotic faecal microbiota composition, even within the cf cohort itself, with higher biodiversity and evenness. we also found, by species-specific pcr, that potentially harmful species (escherichia coli and eubacterium biforme) were abundant in homozygous-f508del and severe cf patients, while beneficial species (faecalibacterium prausnitzii, bifidobacterium spp., and eubacterium limosum) were reduced. conclusions: this is the first report that establishes a link among cftr variants and shifts in faecal microbiota, opening the way to studies that perceive cf as a 'systemic disease', linking the lung and the gut in a joined axis.

TI  == a diet high in resistant starch modulates microbiota composition, scfa concentrations, and gene expression in pig intestine.
AB  == resistant starch (rs) is highly fermentable by microbiota in the colon, resulting in the production of scfas. rs is thought to mediate a large proportion of its health benefits, including increased satiety, through the actions of scfas. the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a diet high in rs on luminal  microbiota composition, luminal scfa concentrations, and the expression of host genes involved in scfa uptake, scfa signaling, and satiety regulation in mucosal  tissue obtained from small intestine, cecum, and colon. twenty adult female pigs  were either assigned to a digestible starch (ds) diet or a diet high in rs (34%)  for a period of 2 wk. after the intervention, luminal content and mucosal scrapings were obtained for detailed molecular analysis. rs was completely degraded in the cecum. in both the cecum and colon, differences in microbiota composition were observed between ds- and rs-fed pigs. in the colon these included the stimulation of the healthy gut-associated butyrate-producing faecalibacterium prausnitzii, whereas potentially pathogenic members of the gammaproteobacteria, including escherichia coli and pseudomonas spp., were reduced in relative abundance. cecal and colonic scfa concentrations were significantly greater in rs-fed pigs, and cecal gene expression of monocarboxylate transporter 1 (slc16a1) and glucagon (gcg) was induced by rs. in  conclusion, our data show that rs modulates microbiota composition, scfa concentrations, and host gene expression in pig intestine. combined, our data provide an enhanced understanding of the interaction between diet, microbiota, and host.

TI  == comparison of bacterial quantities in left and right colon biopsies and faeces.
AB  == aim: to compare quantities of predominant and pathogenic bacteria in mucosal and  faecal samples. methods: twenty patients undergoing diagnostic colonoscopy with endoscopically and histologically normal mucosa were recruited to the study, 14 subjects of which also supplied faecal (f) samples between 15 d to 105 d post colonoscopy. mucosal biopsies were taken from each subject from the midportion of the ascending colon (right side samples, rm) and the sigmoid (left side samples,  lm). predominant intestinal and mucosal bacteria including clostridial 16s rrna gene clusters iv and xivab, bacteroidetes, enterobacteriaceae, bifidobacterium spp., akkermansia muciniphila (a. muciniphila), veillonella spp., collinsella spp., faecalibacterium prausnitzii (f. prausnitzii) and putative pathogens such as escherichia coli (e. coli), clostridium difficile (c. difficile), helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) and staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) were analysed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr). host dna was quantified from the mucosal samples with human glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene targeting qpcr. paired t tests and the pearson correlation were applied for statistical analysis. results: the most prominent bacterial groups were clostridial groups iv and xiva+b and bacteroidetes and bacterial species f. prausnitzii in both sample types. h. pylori and s. aureus were not detected and c. difficile was detected in only one mucosal sample and three faecal samples. e. coli was detected in less than half of the mucosal samples at both sites, but was present in all faecal samples. all detected bacteria, except enterobacteriaceae,  were present at higher levels in the faeces than in the mucosa, but the different locations in the colon presented comparable quantities (rm, lm and f followed by  p(1) for rm vs f, p(2) for lm vs f and p(3) for rm vs lm: 4.17 +/- 0.60 log(10)/g, 4.16 +/- 0.56 log(10)/g, 5.88 +/- 1.92 log(10)/g, p(1) = 0.011, p(2) = 0.0069, p(3) = 0.9778 for a. muciniphila; 6.25 +/- 1.3 log(10)/g, 6.09 +/- 0.81 log(10)/g, 8.84 +/- 1.38 log(10)/g, p(1) < 0.0001, p(2) = 0.0002, p(3) = 0.6893 for bacteroidetes; 5.27 +/- 1.68 log(10)/g, 5.38 +/- 2.06 log(10)/g, 8.20 +/- 1.14 log(10)/g, p(1) < 0.0001, p(2) </= 0.0001, p(3) = 0.7535 for bifidobacterium spp.; 6.44 +/- 1.15 log(10)/g, 6.07 +/-1.45 log(10)/g, 9.74 +/-1.13 log(10)/g, p(1) < 0.0001, p(2) </= 0.0001, p(3) = 0.637 for clostridium cluster iv; 6.65 +/- 1.23 log(10)/g, 6.57 +/- 1.52 log(10)/g, 9.13 +/- 0.96 log(10)/g, p(1) < 0.0001,  p(2) </= 0.0001, p(3) = 0.9317 for clostridium cluster xiva; 4.57 +/- 1.44 log(10)/g, 4.63 +/- 1.34 log(10)/g, 7.05 +/- 2.48 log(10)/g, p(1) = 0.012, p(2) = 0.0357, p(3) = 0.7973 for collinsella spp.; 7.66 +/- 1.50 log(10)/g, 7.60 +/- 1.05 log(10)/g, 10.02 +/- 2.02 log(10)/g, p(1) </= 0.0001, p(2) = 0.0013, p(3) =  0.9919 for f. prausnitzsii; 6.17 +/- 1.3 log(10)/g, 5.85 +/- 0.93 log(10)/g, 7.25 +/- 1.01 log(10)/g, p(1) = 0.0243, p(2) = 0.0319, p(3) = 0.6982 for veillonella spp.; 4.68 +/- 1.21 log(10)/g, 4.71 +/- 0.83 log(10)/g, 5.70 +/- 2.00 log(10)/g,  p(1) = 0.1927, p(2) = 0.0605, p(3) = 0.6476 for enterobacteriaceae). the bifidobacterium spp. counts correlated significantly between mucosal sites and mucosal and faecal samples (pearson correlation coefficients 0.62, p = 0.040 and  0.81, p = 0.005 between the right mucosal sample and faeces and the left mucosal  sample and faeces, respectively). conclusion: non-invasive faecal samples do not  reflect bacterial counts on the mucosa at the individual level, except for bifidobacteria often analysed in probiotic intervention studies.

TI  == sensitivity of pathogenic and commensal bacteria from the human colon to essential oils.
AB  == the microbiota of the intestinal tract plays an important role in colonic health, mediating many effects of dietary components on colonic health and during enteric infections. in the context of the increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance in gut bacteria, complementary therapies are required for the prevention and treatment of enteric infections. here we report the potential application of essential oils (eo) and pure eo compounds to improve human gut health. nerolidol, thymol, eugenol and geraniol inhibited growth of the pathogens escherichia coli o157 : h7(vt(-)), clostridium difficile dsm1296, clostridium perfringens dsm11780, salmonella typhimurium 3530 and salmonella enteritidis s1400 at a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) varying from 50 to 500 p.p.m. most eo showed greater toxicity to pathogens than to commensals. however, the beneficial commensal faecalibacterium prausnitzii was sensitive to eo at similar  or even lower concentrations than the pathogens. the eo showed dose-dependent effects on cell integrity, as measured using propidium iodide, of gram-positive bacteria. these effects were not strongly correlated with growth inhibition, however, suggesting that cell membrane damage occurred but was not the primary cause of growth inhibition. growth inhibition of gram-negative bacteria, in contrast, occurred mostly without cell integrity loss. principal component analysis showed clustering of responses according to bacterial species rather than to the identity of the eo, with the exception that responses to thymol and nerolidol clustered away from the other eo. in conclusion, the selective effects  of some eo might have beneficial effects on gut health if chosen carefully for effectiveness against different species.

TI  == molecular-phylogenetic characterization of the microbiota in ulcerated and non-ulcerated regions in the patients with crohn's disease.
AB  == background: the dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota has been established in crohn's disease (cd), but the molecular characterization of this dysbiosis in chinese subjects with cd remains unclear. this study aims to investigate the predominant bacterial composition of the faecal and mucosal-associated microbiota in chinese cd patients using culture-independent techniques. methods/principal findings: eighteen patients with cd and 9 healthy controls were included in this  study. the faeces and the intestinal mucosal tissues from the ulcerated and nonulcerated sites were subjected to bacterial community fingerprinting using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). the predominant bacterial composition in the faeces and mucosa was determined with dna sequencing and blast. we showed that the bacterial diversity in the faeces of cd patients was reduced compared with that in healthy controls (p<0.01). the faecal bacterial dysbiosis of the patients was characterized by an elevated abundance of gamma-proteobacteria (especially escherichia coli and shigella flexneri) and a reduced proportion of bacteroidetes and firmicutes. five bacterial species defined the microbiota imbalance of the ulcerated mucosa in cd, including an increase in escherichia coli, a decrease in faecalibacterium prausnitzii, lactobacillus coleohominis, bacteroides sp and streptococcus gallolyticus in the  bacterial community as compared with the nonulcerated (p<0.01). conclusions/significance: this is the first description of intestinal microbiota  dysbiosis in chinese cd patients. these results allow a better understanding of the faecal and mucosal microbiota in cd, showing a predominance of some opportunistic pathogenic bacteria and a decrease in beneficial bacterial species. the findings may provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of cd in chinese population.

TI  == mucosa-associated bacteria in two middle-aged women diagnosed with collagenous colitis.
AB  == aim: to characterize the colon microbiota in two women histologically diagnosed with collagenous colitis using a culture-independent method. methods: biopsies were taken from the ascending colon and the total dna was extracted. universal bacterial primers were used to amplify the bacterial 16s rrna genes. the amplicons were then cloned into competent escherichia coli cells. the clones were sequenced and identified by comparison to known sequences. results: the clones could be divided into 44 different phylotypes. the microbiota was dominated by firmicutes and bacteroidetes. seven phylotypes were found in both patients and constituted 47.5% of the total number of clones. of these, the most dominating were clones similar to bacteroides cellulosilyticus, bacteroides caccae, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides dorei within  bacteroidetes. sequences similar to faecalibacterium prausnitzii and clostridium  citroniae were also found in both patients. conclusion: a predominance of potentially pathogenic bacteroides spp., and the presence of clones showing similarity to clostridium clostridioforme were found but the overall colon microbiota showed similarities to a healthy one. etiologies for collagenous colitis other than an adverse bacterial flora must also be considered.

TI  == increase in fecal primary bile acids and dysbiosis in patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.
AB  == background: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a multifactorial disease for which  a dysbiosis of the gut microbiota has been described. bile acids (ba) could play  a role as they are endogenous laxatives and are metabolized by gut microbiota. we compared fecal ba profiles and microbiota in healthy subjects (hs) and patients with diarrhea-predominant ibs (ibs-d), and we searched for an association with symptoms. methods: clinical features and stool samples were collected in ibs-d patients and hs. fecal ba profiles were generated using hplc coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. the fecal microbiota composition was assessed by q-pcr targeting dominant bacterial groups and species implicated in ba transformation.  key results: fourteen ibs-d patients and 18 hs were included. the two groups were comparable in terms of age and sex. the percentage of fecal primary ba was significantly higher in ibs-d patients than in hs, and it was significantly correlated with stool consistency and frequency. fecal counts of all bacteria, lactobacillus, coccoides, leptum and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were similar. there was a significant increase of escherichia coli and a significant decrease of leptum and bifidobacterium in ibs-d patients. conclusions & inferences: we report an increase of primary ba in the feces of ibs-d patients compared to hs, correlated with stool consistency and frequency. a dysbiosis of different bacterial groups was detected, some of them involved in ba transformation. as the gut microbiota is the exclusive pathway to transform primary into secondary ba, this suggests a functional consequence of dysbiosis, leading to lower ba transformation.

TI  == smokers with active crohn's disease have a clinically relevant dysbiosis of the gastrointestinal microbiota.
AB  == background: patients with crohn's disease (cd) have an intestinal dysbiosis with  components of the microbiota exerting differential immune effects. smoking is associated with an increased incidence of cd, more frequent relapse, and greater  burden of surgery. this study aimed to investigate the association between smoking and the intestinal microbiota in patients with active cd. methods: patients with active cd (n = 103) and healthy controls (n = 66) were recruited and demographic and clinical data recorded including current smoking behavior. fecal samples were collected and analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization using probes targeting 16s rrna of bacteria previously shown to be altered in active cd (bifidobacteria, bacteroides, clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale, escherichia coli, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii). results: in total,  29/101 (29%) patients with cd and 8/58 (14%) controls were current smokers (p = 0.032). following multivariate analysis, smoking was found to have a significant  and independent effect on the microbiota of patients with cd, with higher bacteroides-prevotella in smokers (38.4%) compared with nonsmokers (28.1%) (f((1,93)) = 12.6, p = 0.001). healthy controls who smoked also had higher bacteroides-prevotella (34.8%) than nonsmokers (24.1%) (f((1,55)) = 4.5, p = 0.038). in the pooled multivariate analysis, patients with cd had higher bifidobacteria (f((1,156)) = 30.5, p < 0.001), higher bacteroides-prevotella (f((1,156)) = 6.5, p = 0.012), and lower f. prausnitzii (f((1,156)) = 3.8, p = 0.052) compared with healthy controls. conclusions: smokers have luminal microbiota that consist of significantly higher bacteroides. investigation of whether this is one mechanism through which the negative effects of smoking on cd are mediated is warranted.

TI  == identification and characterization of potential performance-related gut microbiotas in broiler chickens across various feeding trials.
AB  == three broiler feeding trials were investigated in order to identify gut bacteria  consistently linked with improvements in bird performance as measured by feed efficiency. trials were done in various geographic locations and varied in diet composition, broiler breed, and bird age. gut microbial communities were investigated using microbial profiling. eight common performance-linked operational taxonomic units (otus) were identified within both the ilea (180, 492, and 564-566) and ceca (140-142, 218-220, 284-286, 312, and 482) across trials. otu 564-566 was associated with lower performance, while otus 140-142, 482, and 492 were associated with improved performance. targeted cloning and sequencing of these eight otus revealed that they represented 26 bacterial species or phylotypes which clustered phylogenetically into seven groups related  to lactobacillus spp., ruminococcaceae, clostridiales, gammaproteobacteria, bacteroidales, clostridiales/lachnospiraceae, and unclassified bacteria/clostridia. where bacteria were identifiable to the phylum level, they belonged predominantly to the firmicutes, with bacteroidetes and proteobacteria also identified. some of the potential performance-related phylotypes showed high sequence identity with classified bacteria (lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus aviarius, lactobacillus crispatus, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, escherichia coli, gallibacterium anatis, clostridium lactatifermentans, ruminococcus torques, bacteroides vulgatus, and alistipes finegoldii). the 16s rrna gene sequence information generated will allow quantitative assays to be developed which will enable elucidations of which of these phylotypes are truly performance related. this information could be used to monitor strategies to improve feed efficiency and feed formulation for optimal gut health.

TI  == bacteria as trigger for chronic gastrointestinal disorders.
AB  == apart from acute infections, microorganisms may also induce or perpetuate chronic inflammatory diseases and reversible or irreversible proliferation of various cells in the gastrointestinal tract (the extreme being adenocarcinoma and lymphoma). helicobacter pylori is not only involved in the pathogenesis of lymphoma and gastric adenocarcinoma. the steps and mechanisms of the carcinogenic process involve host predisposition, environmental factors, and strain virulence. the steps of lymphoma genesis include chronic inflammation, acquisition of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue in the stomach, proliferation of the b lymphocytes in an inflammatory context, acquisition of genetic anomalies and dysregulation of the nf-kappab pathway. the role of campylobacter jejuni in immunoproliferative small bowel disease has also been shown and eradication of this bacterium can cure the lymphoma at its early stage. the evidence for the role of some bacteria in colon cancer development is discussed. opportunistic pathogens are detected in the stools or mucosa of a proportion of subjects with crohn's disease. they include mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis, adherent invasive escherichia coli, and clostridium difficile. a dysbiosis has been repeatedly observed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. instability of the dominant microbiota and decreased biodiversity (especially in the firmicutes  phylum) are major characteristics. the decrease of faecalibacterium prausnitzii seems to have a prognostic value to predict relapse of crohn's disease after surgery. finally, important perspectives are opened by new tools such as metagenomics and metabolomics of the gastrointestinal ecosystems. major tracks concern irritable bowel syndrome, colon cancer and obesity.

TI  == intestinal microbiota was assessed in cirrhotic patients with hepatitis b virus infection. intestinal microbiota of hbv cirrhotic patients.
AB  == to unravel the profile of intestinal microecological parameters in chinese patients with asymptomatic carriage of hepatitis b virus (hbv), chronic hepatitis b, decompensated hbv cirrhosis, and health controls and to establish their correlation with liver disease progression, we performed quantitative pcr and immunological techniques to investigate fecal parameters, including population of fecal predominant bacteria and the abundance of some virulence genes derived from escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, and clostridium perfringens in fecal crude dna and some immunological parameters in extracts of all fecal samples. data analysis indicated that 16s rrna gene copy numbers for faecalibacterium prausnitzii, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacteriaceae, bifidobacteria, and lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, and weissella) showed marked variation in the intestine of hbv cirrhotic patients. the bifidobacteria/enterobacteriaceae (b/e) ratio, which may  indicate microbial colonization resistance of the bowel, was decreased significantly in turn from 1.15 +/- 0.11 in healthy controls, 0.99 +/- 0.09 in asymptomatic carriers, and 0.76 +/- 0.08 in patients with chronic hepatitis b to  0.64 +/- 0.09 in patients with decompensated hbv cirrhosis (for all, p < 0.01). this suggests that b/e ratio is useful for following the level of intestinal microecological disorder in the course of liver disease progression. the data for virulence gene abundance suggested increased diversity of virulence factors during liver disease progression. fecal secretory iga and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in decompensated hbv cirrhotic patients were present at higher levels than in other groups, which indicates that a complicated autoregulatory system tries to achieve a new intestinal microecological balance.

AB  == background and aims: a general dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota has been established in patients with crohn's disease (cd), but a systematic characterisation of this dysbiosis is lacking. therefore the composition of the predominant faecal microbiota of patients with cd was studied in comparison with  the predominant composition in unaffected controls. whether dysbiosis is present  in relatives of patients cd was also examined. methods: focusing on families with at least three members affected with cd, faecal samples of 68 patients with cd, 84 of their unaffected relatives and 55 matched controls were subjected to community fingerprinting of the predominant microbiota using denaturing gradient  gel electrophoresis (dgge). to analyse the dgge profiles, bionumerics software and non-parametric statistical analyses (spss v.17.0) were used. observed differences in the predominant microbiota were subsequently confirmed and quantified with real-time pcr. results: five bacterial species characterised dysbiosis in cd, namely a decrease in dialister invisus (p=0.04), an uncharacterised species of clostridium cluster xiva (p = 0.03), faecalibacterium  prausnitzii (p < 1.3 x 10(-)(5)) and bifidobacterium adolescentis (p = 5.4 x 10(-)(6)), and an increase in ruminococcus gnavus (p = 2.1 x 10(-)(7)). unaffected relatives of patients with cd had less collinsella aerofaciens (p = 0.004) and a member of the escherichia coli-shigella group (p = 0.01) and more ruminococcus torques (p = 0.02) in their predominant microbiota as compared with  healthy subjects. conclusion: unaffected relatives of patients with cd have a different composition of their microbiota compared with healthy controls. this dysbiosis is not characterised by lack of butyrate producing-bacteria as observed in cd but suggests a role for microorganisms with mucin degradation capacity.

TI  == the role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  == crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc) have features that suggest bacterial involvement, and all genetic models of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) require the presence of commensal bacteria. cd is associated with innate immune response genes such as nod2/card15 and the autophagy genes atg16l1 and irgm. however, ibd responds to immunosuppression, suggesting that any bacteria involved are not acting as conventional pathogens. molecular techniques are rapidly advancing our knowledge of the gut microbiota. in cd there is reduced diversity,  and notably a reduction in the probiotic faecalibacterium prausnitzii, the presence of which in the terminal ileum is associated with a reduced risk of recurrence following surgery. there is also a consistent increase in mucosa-associated escherichia coli with an "adherent and invasive" phenotype, which allows them to replicate inside macrophages and induce granulomas. speculation that cd could be caused by the mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (map) continues. the response to antitumor necrosis factor treatments suggests that, if relevant at all, map is not acting as a conventional pathogen. however, there is increased colonization by map in cd, and there is evidence that it could have an indirect effect mediated by the suppression of macrophage function. uc relapse is frequently associated with infection by pathogens, but there is less evidence for involvement of a specific bacterial species. poor barrier integrity followed by an inflammatory reaction to bacterial components, with chronicity maintained by an autoimmune process, seems a plausible pathogenic model. bacterial theories of pathogenesis are now becoming testable by targeted therapeutic interventions.

TI  == differential adaptation of human gut microbiota to bariatric surgery-induced weight loss: links with metabolic and low-grade inflammation markers.
AB  == objective: obesity alters gut microbiota ecology and associates with low-grade inflammation in humans. roux-en-y gastric bypass (rygb) surgery is one of the most efficient procedures for the treatment of morbid obesity resulting in drastic weight loss and improvement of metabolic and inflammatory status. we analyzed the impact of rygb on the modifications of gut microbiota and examined links with adaptations associated with this procedure. research design and methods: gut microbiota was profiled from fecal samples by real-time quantitative pcr in 13 lean control subjects and in 30 obese individuals (with seven type 2 diabetics) explored before (m0), 3 months (m3), and 6 months (m6) after rygb. results: four major findings are highlighted: 1) bacteroides/prevotella group was lower in obese subjects than in control subjects at m0 and increased at m3. it was negatively correlated with corpulence, but the correlation depended highly on caloric intake; 2) escherichia coli species increased at m3 and inversely correlated with fat mass and leptin levels independently of changes in food intake; 3) lactic acid bacteria including lactobacillus/leuconostoc/pediococcus group and bifidobacterium genus decreased at m3; and 4) faecalibacterium prausnitzii species was lower in subjects with diabetes and associated negatively with inflammatory markers at m0 and throughout the follow-up after surgery independently of changes in food intake. conclusions: these results suggest that  components of the dominant gut microbiota rapidly adapt in a starvation-like situation induced by rygb while the f. prausnitzii species is directly linked to  the reduction in low-grade inflammation state in obesity and diabetes independently of calorie intake.

TI  == the role of mucosal immunity and host genetics in defining intestinal commensal bacteria.
AB  == purpose of review: dramatic advances in molecular characterization of the largely noncultivable enteric microbiota have facilitated better understanding of the composition of this complex ecosystem at broad phylogenetic levels. this review outlines current understanding of mechanisms by which commensal bacteria are controlled and shaped into functional communities by innate and adaptive immune responses, antimicrobial peptides produced by epithelial cells and host genetic factors. recent findings: secretory iga, which targets enteric bacteria, regulates the number, composition, and function of luminal bacteria. likewise, epithelial production of antimicrobial peptides helps control enteric microbiota  growth, translocation, and perhaps composition. the developing role of innate signaling pathways, such as toll-like receptors and nod2, is beginning to be studied, with dysbiosis following their genetic deletion. inflammation and effector immune responses lead to decreased diversity and selective alterations of functionally active bacterial species such as escherichia coli and faecalibacterium prausnitzii that have proinflammatory and protective activities, respectively. studies of humans, mice, and comparative species indicate that both genetic and early environmental factors influence the development of a stable intestinal microbiota. summary: genetic and mucosal immunity strongly influence the composition and function of enteric commensal bacteria. this understanding should help develop strategies to correct dysfunctional altered microbiota in genetically susceptible individuals, better diagnose and correct potential dysbiosis in high-risk individuals at a preclinical stage, and therapeutically target pathogenic bacterial species that help drive chronic inflammatory conditions.

TI  == dysbiosis of fecal microbiota in crohn's disease patients as revealed by a custom phylogenetic microarray.
AB  == background: a custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  rna probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and crohn's disease (cd) patients. methods: oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "goarray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16s rrna sequences. fecal 16s rdna  from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six cd patients were used as  template to generate fluorescently labeled crna that was hybridized to the microarray. differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with species-specific primer sets. results: the microarray analyses showed that eubacterium rectale, bacteroides fragilis group, b. vulgatus, ruminococcus albus, r. callidus, r. bromii, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the cd patients, while enterococcus sp., clostridium difficile, escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, and listeria sp. were more abundant in the cd group. conclusions: the microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. in addition, the microarray showed that enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the cd patients. this microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == highlighting new phylogenetic specificities of crohn's disease microbiota.
AB  == background: recent studies suggest that gastrointestinal (gi) microbes play a part in the pathogenesis of crohn's disease (cd). methods: fecal samples were collected from 16 healthy individuals and 16 cd patients (age- and sex-matched).  the dna extracted from these samples were subjected to two different methods of microbiome analysis. specific bacterial groups were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods using primers designed using a high-throughput in-house bioinformatics pipeline. the same dna extracts were also used to produce fluorescently labeled crna amplicons to interrogate a custom-designed phylogenetic microarray for intestinal bacteria. results: even though the intersubject variability was high, differences in the fecal microbiomes of healthy and cd patients were detected. faecalibacterium prausnitzii and escherichia coli were more represented in healthy and ileal cd patients, respectively. additionally, probes specific for ruminococcus bromii, oscillibacter valericigenes, bifidobacterium bifidum, and eubacterium rectale produced stronger hybridization signals with the dna samples from healthy subjects. conversely, species overrepresented in cd patients were e. coli, enterococcus faecium, and species from the proteobacteria not normally found in the healthy human gi tract. furthermore, we detected "healthy specific" molecular species or operational taxonomic units (otus) that are not closely related to any known species (faecalibacterium, subdoligranulum, and oscillospora species), indicating that the phylogenetic dysbiosis is broader than at strain or species level. conclusions: these two techniques of microbiome analysis provided a statistically robust new picture of the dysbiosis in fecal microbiota from ileal  cd patients. specifically, we identified a set of six species discriminant for cd, which provides a preliminary diagnostic tool.

TI  == microbiota in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  == objective: to test the hypothesis that compared with controls, children with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) exhibit differences in the relationships between gut microbiota and disease activity. study design: children and adolescents (n =  69; median age, 14 years) with ibd and 25 healthy controls (median age, 14 years) were recruited for the study. the disease activity was determined according to the pediatric ulcerative colitis activity index or the pediatric crohn disease activity index. cell counts of 9 bacterial groups and species in the fecal microbiota were monitored by real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. results: although no major changes were observed in patients with ulcerative colitis, except for a decrease in bifidobacteria in the active state of ibd, children with active and inactive crohn's disease (cd) had lower numbers of faecalibacterium prausnitzii and bifidobacteria (p <.05), and patients with active cd had higher numbers of escherichia coli (p <.05). conclusions: the microbiota in children with cd is characterized by decreased numbers of f praunsitzii and increased numbers of e coli.

TI  == selected microbial groups and short-chain fatty acids profile in a simulated chicken cecum supplemented with two strains of lactobacillus.
AB  == among the bacterial fermentation end products in the chicken cecum, butyrate is of particular importance because of its nutritional properties for the epithelial cell and pathogen inhibitory effects in the gut. an in vitro experiment, operated with batch bioreactor, was conducted to quantify butyric-producing bacteria in a  simulated broiler cecum supplemented with lactobacillus salivarius ssp. salicinius jcm 1230 and lactobacillus agilis jcm 1048 during 24 h of incubation.  selected bacterial species were determined by real-time pcr and short-chain fatty acids and lactate concentrations were monitored. the results showed that after 24 h of incubation, lactobacillus supplementation significantly increased the number of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and faecalibacterium prausnitzii in medium containing cecal content and lactobacilli supplementation (cc + l) compared with  the control (cc). addition of lactobacilli did not alter escherichia coli and clostridium butyricum, whereas it significantly (p < 0.05) reduced salmonella in  treatment cc + l compared with the cc treatment. propionate and butyrate formation were significantly (p < 0.05) increased in treatment cc + l as compared with the cc treatment. lactate was only detected in treatment containing 2 lactobacillus strains. after 24 h of incubation, acetate concentration significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in all treatments. it was suggested that lactate produced by lactobacillus in the cecal content improved the growth of butyric producers such as f. prausnitzii, which significantly increased butyrate  accumulation. additionally, the results showed that butyrate and propionate inhibited salmonella without influencing the e. coli profile.

TI  == the microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease in different age groups.
AB  == background: many efforts were made in the past decades to assess the role of gut  microbiota in inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd), leading to the hypothesis that an altered microbial composition, other than the presence of a specific pathogen, could be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. on the other hand, existing differences in gut microbial community between distinct classes of age make sense of an increasing research in microbial shifts in ibd. methods: cultural, molecular, metabolomic and metagenomic approaches are trying to define the human  gut microbiota in different age groups. results and conclusion: an increase in anaerobic bacteria (bacteroidesvulgatus, streptococcus faecalis) was observed in  adult ibd, whereas an increase in aerobic and facultative-anaerobic (escherichia  coli) was found in pediatric ibd. overall higher bacterial cell counts were observed in ibd, jointly with a general loss of biodiversity and a preponderance  of bacteroidetes and a parallel decrease of firmicutes phylum: a predominance of  potential harmful members of proteobacteria (e. coli) and low abundance of beneficial species (faecalibacterium prausnitzii) was also reported in pediatric  and adult age groups, respectively. microbial community of elderly subjects contains a wider range of different species than those of children and adults, both in healthy and ibd status.

TI  == effects of a gluten-free diet on gut microbiota and immune function in healthy adult human subjects.
AB  == diet influences the composition of the gut microbiota and host's health, particularly in patients suffering from food-related diseases. coeliac disease (cd) is a permanent intolerance to cereal gluten proteins and the only therapy for the patients is to adhere to a life-long gluten-free diet (gfd). in the present preliminary study, the effects of a gfd on the composition and immune function of the gut microbiota were analysed in ten healthy subjects (mean age 30.3 years) over 1 month. faecal microbiota was analysed by fluorescence in situ  hybridisation (fish) and quantitative pcr (qpcr). the ability of faecal bacteria  to stimulate cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) was determined by elisa. no significant differences in dietary intake were found before and after the gfd except for reductions (p = 0.001) in polysaccharides. bifidobacterium, clostridium lituseburense and faecalibacterium prausnitzii proportions decreased (p = 0.007, p = 0.031 and p = 0.009, respectively) as a result of the gfd analysed by fish. bifidobacterium, lactobacillus and bifidobacterium longum counts decreased (p = 0.020, p = 0.001 and p = 0.017, respectively), while enterobacteriaceae and escherichia coli counts increased (p  = 0.005 and p = 0.003) after the gfd assessed by qpcr. tnf-alpha, interferon-gamma, il-10 and il-8 production by pbmc stimulated with faecal samples was also reduced (p = 0.021, p = 0.037, p = 0.002 and p = 0.007, respectively) after the diet. therefore, the gfd led to reductions in beneficial  gut bacteria populations and the ability of faecal samples to stimulate the host's immunity. thus, the gfd may constitute an environmental variable to be considered in treated cd patients for its possible effects on gut health.

TI  == commensal bacteria, traditional and opportunistic pathogens, dysbiosis and bacterial killing in inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  == purpose of review: the authors present evidence published during the past 2 years of the roles of commensal and pathogenic bacteria in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory bowel diseases. recent findings: rodent models conclusively implicate commensal enteric bacteria in chronic, immune-mediated, experimental colitis, and genetically determined defects in bacterial killing by innate immune cells are found in a subset of patients with crohn's disease. there is no evidence that a single pathogen, including mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis, causes crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. however, adherent/invasive escherichia coli are associated with ileal crohn's disease, with the mechanisms and genetics of adherent/invasive e. coli virulence being elucidated. molecular characterization of the microbiota in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases reveals decreased biodiversity of commensal bacteria, most notably the phyla bacteroidetes and firmicutes, including the clinically relevant faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and increased e. coli concentrations. vsl#3 is one probiotic preparation shown to be efficacious in certain clinical situations in small clinical trials. summary: further characterization of altered microbiota in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases and linking dysbiosis with host genetic alterations in immunoregulation, innate microbial killing and barrier function are critical, so that individualized treatments to increase beneficial commensals and their metabolic products (probiotic and prebiotic administration) and diminish deleterious species such as adherent/invasive e. coli can be tailored for defined patient subsets.

TI  == bacterial flora in inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  == the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) involves an interaction between host susceptibility (which is partly genetically determined), mucosal immunity and the intestinal milieu. micro-organisms have physiological effects on mucosal structure, epithelial turnover, the intestinal immune cells and, thus, on many intestinal functions. toll-like receptors and nucleotide oligomerisation-binding domain proteins in host cells recognise specific bacterial molecules and modify the immune response. human studies have repeatedly shown that the microbiota of patients with ibd differs from that of controls and  is unstable, both in the intestinal lumen and at the surface of the mucosa. a single pathogen has not been identified, but potentially pro-inflammatory micro-organisms have been found in samples from ibd patients more often than from healthy controls. these include mycobacterium paratuberculosis, and enteroadherent and invasive escherichia coli in crohn's disease (cd). ecological  descriptions of the microbiota present in patients with ibd (either in the faeces or adherent to the mucosa) have repeatedly reported a decrease in usually dominant bacteria, especially those from the dominant phylum firmicutes. a decrease in the biodiversity of firmicutes has been observed in cd, while a recent study has shown that a decrease in firmicutes, especially faecalibacterium prausnitzii, was associated with cd and the post-operative recurrence of cd lesions in the ileum. taken together, these results suggest that dysbiosis, or an imbalance within the (dominant) intestinal microbiota, may favour ibd.

TI  == twin studies reveal specific imbalances in the mucosa-associated microbiota of patients with ileal crohn's disease.
AB  == background: large interindividual variation in the composition of the intestinal  microbiota between unrelated individuals has made it challenging to identify specific aspects of dysbiosis that lead to crohn's disease (cd). methods: to reduce variations in exposure during establishment of the gut flora and the influence of genotype, we studied the mucosa-associated microbiota of monozygotic twin pairs that were discordant (n = 6) or concordant (n = 4) for cd. dna was extracted from biopsies collected from 5 locations between the ileum and rectum.  bacterial 16s ribosomal rna genes were amplified and community composition assessed by terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism, cloning and sequencing, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results:  the microbial compositions at all biopsy locations for each individual were similar, regardless of disease state, but there were differences between individuals. in particular, individuals with predominantly ileal cd had a dramatically lower abundance (p < 0.001) of faecalibacterium prausnitzii and increased abundance (p < 0.03) of escherichia coli compared to healthy co-twins and those with cd localized in the colon. this dysbiosis was significantly correlated to the disease phenotype rather than genotype. conclusions: the reduced abundance of f. prausnitzii and increased abundance of e. coli are indicative of an ileal cd phenotype, distinct from colonic cd, and the relative abundances of these specific bacterial populations are promising biomarker candidates for differential diagnosis of cd and eventually customized treatment.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of the gene for cellobiose 2-epimerase from a ruminal strain of eubacterium cellulosolvens.
AB  == cellobiose 2-epimerase (ce; ec 5.1.3.11) is known to catalyze the reversible epimerization of cellobiose to 4-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl-d-mannose in ruminococcus albus cells. here, we report a ce in a ruminal strain of eubacterium cellulosolvens for the first time. the nucleotide sequence of the ce had an orf of 1218 bp (405 amino acids; 46 963.3 da). the ce from e. cellulosolvens showed 44-54% identity to n-acyl-d-glucosamine 2-epimerase-like hypothetical proteins in the genomes of coprococcus eutactus, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, clostridium phytofermentans, caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus, and eubacterium siraeum. surprisingly, it exhibited only 46% identity to a ce from r. albus. the recombinant enzyme expressed in escherichia coli was purified by two-step chromatography. the purified enzyme had a molecular mass of 46.7 kda and exhibited optimal activity at around 35 degrees c and ph 7.0-8.5. in addition to  cello-oligosaccharides, it converted lactose to epilactose (4-o-beta-d-galactopyranosyl-d-mannose).

TI  == exopolysaccharides produced by intestinal bifidobacterium strains act as fermentable substrates for human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == eleven exopolysaccharides (eps) isolated from different human intestinal bifidobacterium strains were tested in fecal slurry batch cultures and compared with glucose and the prebiotic inulin for their abilities to act as fermentable substrates for intestinal bacteria. during incubation, the increases in levels of short-chain fatty acids (scfa) were considerably more pronounced in cultures with eps, glucose, and inulin than in controls without carbohydrates added, indicating that the substrates assayed were fermented by intestinal bacteria. shifts in molar proportions of scfa during incubation with eps and inulin caused a decrease in the acetic acid-to-propionic acid ratio, a possible indicator of the hypolipidemic effect of prebiotics, with the lowest values for this parameter being obtained for eps from the species bifidobacterium longum and from bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum strain c52. this behavior was contrary to that  found with glucose, a carbohydrate not considered to be a prebiotic and for which a clear increase of this ratio was obtained during incubation. quantitative real-time pcr showed that eps exerted a moderate bifidogenic effect, which was comparable to that of inulin for some polymers but which was lower than that found for glucose. pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 16s rrna gene fragments using universal primers was employed to analyze microbial groups other  than bifidobacteria. changes in banding patterns during incubation with eps indicated microbial rearrangements of bacteroides and escherichia coli relatives. moreover, the use of eps from b. pseudocatenulatum in fecal cultures from some individuals accounted for the prevalence of desulfovibrio and faecalibacterium prausnitzii, whereas incubation with eps from b. longum supported populations close to anaerostipes, prevotella, and/or oscillospira. thus, eps synthesized by  intestinal bifidobacteria could act as fermentable substrates for microorganisms  in the human gut environment, modifying interactions among intestinal populations.

TI  == imbalance in the composition of the duodenal microbiota of children with coeliac  disease.
AB  == coeliac disease (cd) is the most common immune-mediated enteropathy characterized by chronic inflammation of the small intestinal mucosa. the ingestion of gluten is responsible for the symptoms of cd, but other environmental factors are also thought to play a role in this disorder. in this study, the composition of the duodenal microbiota of coeliac children with active disease, symptom-free cd patients on a gluten-free diet and control children was determined. bacteriological analyses of duodenal biopsy specimens were carried out by fluorescent in situ hybridization coupled with flow cytometry. the proportions of total bacteria and gram-negative bacteria were significantly higher in cd patients with active disease than in symptom-free cd patients and controls. bacteroides and escherichia coli groups were significantly more abundant in cd patients with active disease than in controls, whilst these bacterial deviations  were normalized in symptom-free cd patients. the ratio of lactobacillus--bifidobacterium to bacteroides--e. coli was significantly reduced  in coeliac patients with either active or inactive disease compared with controls. the differences in atopobium, eubacterium rectale--clostridium coccoides, clostridium histolyticum, clostridium lituseburense, sulphate-reducing bacteria and faecalibacterium prausnitzii populations among the three groups of children were less relevant. overall, the higher incidence of gram-negative and potentially pro-inflammatory bacteria in the duodenal microbiota of coeliac children was linked to the symptomatic presentation of the disease and could favour the pathological process of the disorder.
