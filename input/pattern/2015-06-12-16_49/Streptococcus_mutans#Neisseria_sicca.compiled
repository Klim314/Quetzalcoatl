TI  - Selective sensitization of bacteria to peroxide damage associated with fluoride inhibition of catalase and pseudocatalase.
AB  - Fluoride and sulfide are known inhibitors of heme catalases in acid environments. Staphylococcus aureus H cells were found to be sensitized by fluoride or sulfide to H2O2 killing at acid pH values in the range of 3.5 to 4.0, and catalase activity was reduced concomitantly. In contrast, fluoride had little effect on H2O2 killing of Streptococcus mutans GS-5, which has fluoride-insensitive peroxidase activity, but still is more sensitive to H2O2 than is S. aureus in the absence of fluoride. Fluoride but not sulfide was inhibitory also for the Mn-containing, non-heme pseudocatalase of Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 14431 over a wide pH range, and this inhibitory effect was reflected in enhanced H2O2 killing in the presence of fluoride. In addition, we found that catalase-positive S. aureus or Neisseria sicca could protect catalase-negative S. mutans against killing by H2O2 in mixed suspensions, but protection was compromised by fluoride or sulfide under acid conditions. Thus, catalase-positive organisms could protect a catalase-negative organism against peroxide damage, but inhibition of catalase reduced protection. These findings are pertinent to the widespread use of fluoride and peroxide in oral health care products.
TI  - Production of bacteriocin-like substances by human oral streptococci.
AB  - A sample of human streptococci (mainly Streptococcus mutans species) from dental  plaques was examined in order to evaluate the production frequency and activity spectrum of bacteriocin-like substances (mutacins). 89% of the 55 Streptococcus mutans strains produced substances with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity. The bacteriocins produced showed a marked inhibitory activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Among the Gram-negative species tested, only Neisseria sicca was inhibited by 25% of Streptococcus mutans strains. Also, 16 strains belonging to oral streptococci other than Streptococcus mutans, were examined for their inhibitory capacity against the same indicator. The authors stress the importance of mutacins production in oral ecology and Streptococcus mutans pathogenicity.
TI  - Comparative adhesion of seven species of streptococci isolated from the blood of  patients with sub-acute bacterial endocarditis to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro.
AB  - The adhesion to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro of 21 strains of streptococci isolated from the blood of patients with sub-acute bacterial endocarditis (SABE) was measured. The species, in order of greatest adhesion, were Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus milleri, Streptococcus sanguis, dextran-positive Streptococcus mitior, dextran-negative Streptococcus mitior and Streptococcus salivarius. Individual strains within species, however, cannot be assumed to be representative of their species and may exhibit unusually high or low adhesion. Adhesion depended upon both bacterial concentration and period of contact. There was no simple relationship between ability to adhere and liability to cause endocarditis. Formation of dextran did not increase adhesion. The streptococci were more adhesive than strains of Escherichia coli and Neisseria sicca and less adhesive than strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.
