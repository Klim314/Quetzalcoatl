TI  - The rising tide of bloodstream infections with Actinomyces species: bimicrobial infection with Actinomyces odontolyticus and Escherichia coli in an intravenous drug user.
AB  - Clinicians of all specialties need to be aware of a recent, nationwide increase in the number of Actinomyces bloodstream infections. We report a case of bimicrobial bloodstream infection with Actinomyces odontolyticus and Escherichia coli in an intravenous drug user. A 36-year-old, male intravenous drug user was admitted with acute-onset pleuritic chest pain, back pain, pyrexia, tachycardia, tachypnoea and hypotension. Chest CT showed multiple, bilateral, cavitating lung lesions, most likely the result of septic emboli originating from an infected deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Blood cultures led to a mixed growth of A. odontolyticus, identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF), and E. coli. The rising tide of bloodstream infections with Actinomyces species is likely to continue with the increasing availability of sophisticated molecular identification techniques, including MALDI-TOF. In this case, the results of antimicrobial susceptibility tests were particularly important because the E. coli was susceptible to ciprofloxacin, whereas the A. odontolyticus was resistant.
TI  - Comparison of the gut microbiota of people in France and Saudi Arabia.
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The gut microbiota contributes to energy acquisition from  food, and changes in the gut microbiome are associated with obesity. The eating habits of Saudis are much different than those of Europeans, and our objective was to compare the fecal microbiota of obese and normal weight Saudis and French. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Illumina MiSeq deep sequencing was used to test the gut microbiota of 9 normal weight and 9 obese individuals from Saudi Arabia and 16 normal weight and 12 obese individuals from France. RESULTS: Obese French possessed significantly more relative Proteobacteria (P=0.002) and Bacteroidetes (P=0.05) and had lower richness and biodiversity at all the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) cutoffs (P<0.05) than normal weight French. Obese Saudis possessed significantly more Firmicutes (P=0.001) without a difference in richness (P=0.2) and biodiversity (P=0.3) compared with normal weight Saudis. We found a common bacterial species core of 23 species existing in 50% of obese and normal weight Saudis and 29 species in 50% of obese and normal weight French. Actinomyces odontolyticus, Escherichia coli and Ruminococcus obeum were present in at least 50% of all individuals tested. French individuals had significantly higher richness and biodiversity compared with Saudis at all the OTU cutoffs (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Microbiota differences between obese and normal weight French were not similar to those between obese and normal weight Saudis. The studies of different populations can result in contrasting data regarding the associations of the gut microbiota and obesity.

TI  - Actinomyces odontolyticus: Rare Etiology for Purulent Pericarditis.
AB  - Purulent pericarditis is one of the most common causes of cardiac tamponade and if left untreated has a mortality of 100%. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumonia have been implicated as the main etiology of purulent pericardial effusion followed by fungi and anaerobic sources. Actinomyces odontolyticus pericardial involvement has been reported in the literature only once. To our knowledge, this is the first fatal case of A. odontolyticus purulent pericarditis in the absence of periodontal disease.
TI  - Cultivation of a human-associated TM7 phylotype reveals a reduced genome and epibiotic parasitic lifestyle.
AB  - The candidate phylum TM7 is globally distributed and often associated with human  inflammatory mucosal diseases. Despite its prevalence, the TM7 phylum remains recalcitrant to cultivation, making it one of the most enigmatic phyla known. In this study, we cultivated a TM7 phylotype (TM7x) from the human oral cavity. This extremely small coccus (200-300 nm) has a distinctive lifestyle not previously observed in human-associated microbes. It is an obligate epibiont of an Actinomyces odontolyticus strain (XH001) yet also has a parasitic phase, thereby killing its host. This first completed genome (705 kb) for a human-associated TM7 phylotype revealed a complete lack of amino acid biosynthetic capacity. Comparative genomics analyses with uncultivated environmental TM7 assemblies show remarkable conserved gene synteny and only minimal gene loss/gain that may have occurred as TM7x adapted to conditions within the human host. Transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles provided the first indications, to our knowledge, that there is signaling interaction between TM7x and XH001. Furthermore, the induction of TNF-alpha production in macrophages by XH001 was repressed in the presence of TM7x, suggesting its potential immune suppression ability. Overall, our data provide intriguing insights into the uncultivability, pathogenicity, and unique lifestyle of this previously uncharacterized oral TM7 phylotype.
TI  - Laryngeal actinomycosis.
AB  - Actinomyces odontolyticus, a component of normal human flora, has been implicated in cervicofacial actinomycosis, which most commonly involves the perimandibular soft tissues and is characterized by slowly progressive abscess and sinus tract formation. Actinomycosis has rarely been reported to involve the larynx, and the imaging findings of laryngeal involvement have not been reported. We present a case of laryngeal actinomycosis with findings on computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography.
TI  - The effects of different orthodontic appliances upon microbial communities.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Orthodontic appliances can promote accumulation of dental plaque, with associated enamel decalcification or gingival inflammation. The aim of this study was to examine longer-term microbiological changes during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four orthodontic patients aged 11-14 years undergoing fixed appliance therapy were recruited into the study. Each was randomized for cross-mouth assignment of molar bands and bonded molar tubes to contralateral quadrants of the mouth. All patients received self-ligating brackets, but again using randomization, one upper lateral incisor bracket (left or right) also received an elastomeric ligature. Plaque samples from the molars and upper lateral incisors were obtained at intervals during treatment and up to 1 year after appliance removal. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16S rDNA microarray were used to compare plaque microbial fingerprints. RESULTS: Plaque populations changed within 3 months of commencing treatment at all sites. The greatest differences in plaque composition were seen with self-ligating brackets with an elastomeric ligature. Post-treatment plaque associated with both types of molar attachment contained increased levels of periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and Eubacterium nodatum, while Campylobacter rectus, Parvimonas micra, and Actinomyces odontolyticus were also elevated with bonds. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that orthodontic treatment may cause sustained changes in plaque microbiotas and that molar bond-associated plaque may have raised disease potential.
TI  - The association between detectable plasmatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load and different subgingival microorganisms in Brazilian adults with HIV: a multilevel analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study investigates the association between detectable plasmatic  human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load (HVL) and high levels of periodontal- and non-periodontal-related microorganisms in the subgingival microbiota of individuals with HIV. METHODS: Thirty-seven individuals with HIV were divided into two groups: 1) detectable HVL (n = 15); and 2) undetectable HVL (n = 22). Subgingival biofilm samples were obtained, and the levels of 35 microbial species were determined by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. Periodontal clinical measures and laboratory and sociodemographic data were also registered. chi(2) test, Fisher exact test, and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare groups. Multilevel ordinal regression models were used to test the association between HVL and the levels of 35 microbial species in subgingival biofilm, adjusted for confounders. RESULTS: Of the 35 species studied, 11 (31.4%) showed higher mean levels in the detectable HVL group than undetectable HVL group (P <0.001). These species included Actinomyces naeslundii II, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Veillonella parvula, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter concisus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, and Candida albicans. Significant associations between detectable HVL and high levels of microorganisms, adjusted for confounders, were observed for A. naeslundii I, Actinomyces gerencseriae, C. gingivalis, E. corrodens, C. concisus, Prevotella nigrescens, T. forsythia, and Dialister pneumosintes. CONCLUSION: Detectable plasmatic HVL in individuals with HIV was associated with elevated levels of known periodontal pathogens, such as P. nigrescens, T. forsythia, and E. corrodens, as well as C. concisus, C. gingivalis, and D. pneumosintes in the subgingival biofilm.
TI  - Microbiological evaluation of bacterial and mycotic seal in implant systems with  different implant-abutment interfaces and closing torque values.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible leakage of 3 species of bacteria (Streptococcus sanguinis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Actinomyces odontolyticus) and of Candida albicans and Candida glabrata in osseointegrated implants with different implant-abutment interface (IAI) geometry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two groups of implants, (1) implant-abutment unit with a tube-in-tube interface and (2) implant-abutment unit with a flat-to-flat interface closed with different torque values, were compared in the study. In the first phase, the implants were assembled and cultured in vitro for 7 days. The implants and abutments were disconnected and samples were taken and cultured. In the second phase, the internal part of each implant was inoculated with 0.1 microL of microbial broth and then connected to the respective abutments. Afterward, medium samples were taken and cultured. RESULTS: The group 1 implants were more resistant to colonization than those of group 2 (P < 0.05). The intragroup difference was significant between the implant-abutment units assembled with the recommended torque values and those with lower torque values (P < 0.01) for both the groups. CONCLUSION: IAI geometry influences both bacterial and yeast colonization inside the implants as well as the torque value used to connect abutments to implants.
TI  - The cultivable human oral gluten-degrading microbiome and its potential implications in coeliac disease and gluten sensitivity.
AB  - Coeliac disease is characterized by intestinal inflammation caused by gluten, proteins which are widely contained in the Western diet. Mammalian digestive enzymes are only partly capable of cleaving gluten, and fragments remain that induce toxic responses in patients with coeliac disease. We found that the oral microbiome is a novel and rich source of gluten-degrading organisms. Here we report on the isolation and characterization of the cultivable resident oral microbes that are capable of cleaving gluten, with special emphasis on the immunogenic domains. Bacteria were obtained by a selective culturing approach and enzyme activities were characterized by: (i) hydrolysis of paranitroanilide-derivatized gliadin-derived tripeptide substrates; (ii) gliadin degradation in-gel (gliadin zymography); (iii) gliadin degradation in solution; (iv) proteolysis of the highly immunogenic alpha-gliadin-derived 33-mer peptide. For selected strains pH activity profiles were determined. The culturing strategy yielded 87 aerobic and 63 anaerobic strains. Species with activity in at least two of the four assays were typed as: Rothia mucilaginosa HOT-681, Rothia aeria HOT-188, Actinomyces odontolyticus HOT-701, Streptococcus mitis HOT-677, Streptococcus sp. HOT-071, Neisseria mucosa HOT-682 and Capnocytophaga sputigena HOT-775, with Rothia species being active in all four assays. Cleavage specificities and substrate preferences differed among the strains identified. The approximate molecular weights of the enzymes were ~75 kD (Rothia spp.), ~60 kD (A. odontolyticus) and ~150 kD (Streptococcus spp.). In conclusion, this study identified new gluten-degrading microorganisms in the upper gastrointestinal tract. A cocktail of the most active oral bacteria, or their isolated enzymes, may offer promising new treatment modalities for coeliac disease.

TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ethanol extracts of Laminaria japonica against oral microorganisms.
AB  - Laminaria japonica is a brown alga, which is consumed widely in Korea, Japan, and China. This study investigated the antimicrobial activity of ethanol extracts of L. japonica against oral microbial species to assess the possible application of L. japonica extracts in dental care products. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined in culture medium using a microdilution method. The MICs of ethanol extracts of L. japonica with oral streptococci were 62.5-500 mug/ml and the MBCs were 125-1000 mug/ml. The MICs of Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces odontolyticus were 250 and 62.5 mug/ml, respectively. The MBCs of A. naeslundii and A. odontolyticus were 500 and 250 mug/ml, respectively. The MICs were 250 and 62.5 mug/ml for Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis, respectively. The killing of Streptococcus mutans and P. gingivalis was dependent on the incubation time. The killing of S. mutans, A. odontolyticus, and P. gingivalis was significantly dependent on the extract concentration. Bacterial treatment with L. japonica extracts changed the cell surface texture of S. mutans, A. odontolyticus, and P. gingivalis. The results of this study suggest that L. japonica extracts may be useful for the development of antimicrobial agents to combat oral pathogens.
TI  - Nitrate reductase activity of bacteria in saliva of term and preterm infants.
AB  - The salivary glands of adults concentrate nitrate from plasma into saliva where it is converted to nitrite by bacterial nitrate reductases. Nitrite can play a beneficial role in adult gastrointestinal and cardiovascular physiology. When nitrite is swallowed, some of it is converted to nitric oxide (NO) in the stomach and may then exert protective effects in the gastrointestinal tract and throughout the body. It has yet to be determined either when newborn infants acquire oral nitrate reducing bacteria or what the effects of antimicrobial therapy or premature birth may be on the bacterial processing of nitrate to nitrite. We measured nitrate and nitrite levels in the saliva of adults and both preterm and term human infants in the early weeks of life. We also measured oral bacterial reductase activity in the saliva of both infants and adults, and characterized the species of nitrate reducing bacteria present. Oral bacterial conversion of nitrate to nitrite in infants was either undetectable or markedly lower than the conversion rates of adults. No measurable reductase activity was found in infants within the first two weeks of life, despite the presence of oral nitrate reducing bacteria such as Actinomyces odontolyticus, Veillonella atypica, and Rothia mucilaginosa. We conclude that relatively little nitrite reaches the infant gastrointestinal tract due to the lack of oral bacterial nitrate reductase activity. Given the importance of the nitrate-nitrite-NO axis in adults, the lack of oral nitrate-reducing bacteria in infants may be relevant to the vulnerability of newborns to hypoxic stress and gastrointestinal tract pathologies.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota in adult Down syndrome periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The subgingival microbiota in Down syndrome and non-Down syndrome adults receiving periodic dental care was examined for 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization and the results were related to clinical periodontal attachment loss. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 44 Down syndrome, 66 non-Down syndrome mentally retarded and 83 mentally normal adults were clinically evaluated. This involved, for each subject, the removal of subgingival specimens from three interproximal sites on different teeth; all subgingival samples per subject were then pooled and assessed for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial species using species-specific whole-genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Significant group differences in species proportions averaged across subjects were evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and associations between subgingival species and mean subject attachment loss within Down syndrome and non-Down syndrome subject groups were quantified using Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Down syndrome subjects exhibited greater attachment loss than non-Down syndrome subjects (p=0.05). Most microbial species were present in Down syndrome subjects at levels similar to non-Down syndrome subjects, except for higher proportions of Selenomonas noxia, Propionibacterium acnes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus oralis in Down syndrome subjects compared with non-Down syndrome study subjects, higher proportions of Treponema socranskii in Down syndrome subjects compared with non-Down syndrome mentally retarded subjects, and higher proportions of Streptococcus constellatus in Down syndrome subjects compared with mentally normal subjects. Down syndrome adults classified with periodontitis revealed higher subgingival levels of T. socranskii than Down syndrome subjects with no periodontitis (p=0.02). Higher subgingival proportions of S. constellatus, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, S. noxia and Prevotella nigrescens showed significant positive correlations (r=0.35-0.42) and higher proportions of Actinomyces naeslundii II and Actinomyces odontolyticus showed negative correlations (r=-0.36 to -0.40), with increasing mean subject attachment loss in Down syndrome adults. CONCLUSION: Individuals with Down syndrome show higher levels of some subgingival bacterial species and specific associations between certain subgingival bacterial species and loss of periodontal attachment. These findings are consistent with the notion that certain subgingival bacteria may contribute to the increased level of periodontal disease seen in Down syndrome individuals and raise the question as to the reason for increased colonization in Down syndrome.
TI  - Application of MLST and pilus gene sequence comparisons to investigate the population structures of Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces oris.
AB  - Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces oris are members of the oral biofilm. Their identification using 16S rRNA sequencing is problematic and better achieved by comparison of metG partial sequences. A. oris is more abundant and more frequently isolated than A. naeslundii. We used a multi-locus sequence typing approach to investigate the genotypic diversity of these species and assigned A. naeslundii (n = 37) and A. oris (n = 68) isolates to 32 and 68 sequence types (ST), respectively. Neighbor-joining and ClonalFrame dendrograms derived from the concatenated partial sequences of 7 house-keeping genes identified at least 4 significant subclusters within A. oris and 3 within A. naeslundii. The strain collection we had investigated was an under-representation of the total population since at least 3 STs composed of single strains may represent discrete clusters of strains not well represented in the collection. The integrity of these sub-clusters was supported by the sequence analysis of fimP and fimA, genes coding for the type 1 and 2 fimbriae, respectively. An A. naeslundii subcluster was identified with both fimA and fimP genes and these strains were able to bind to MUC7 and statherin while all other A. naeslundii strains possessed only fimA and did not bind to statherin. An A. oris subcluster harboured a fimA gene similar to that of Actinomyces odontolyticus but no detectable fimP failed to bind significantly to either MUC7 or statherin. These data are evidence of extensive genotypic and phenotypic diversity within the species A. oris and A. naeslundii but the status of the subclusters identified here will require genome comparisons before their phylogenic position can be unequivocally established.
TI  - Liver abscess due to Actinomyces odontolyticus in an immunocompetent patient.
AB  - Liver abscess caused by Actinomyces odontolyticus is rarely reported. We report an immunocompetent patient who developed A. odontolyticus liver abscess, and was successfully treated with antibiotics for 6 weeks and abscess drainage. The isolate could not be identified accurately by one commercial biochemical method and was documented to species level by partial sequencing analysis of 16S rRNA genes.
TI  - Degree of conversion and antimicrobial activity of etch-and-rinse versus self-etching adhesives.
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was designed to compare the self-etching with the etch-and-rinse adhesives regarding the degree of conversion and antimicrobial activity against cariogenic bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The materials used were AdheSE (two-step self-etching), Adper Prompt L-Pop (self-etching, single-step) and Excite (etch-and-rinse) adhesives. The degree of conversion was measured using Fourier Transformation Infrared Spectroscopy. The absorbance peaks of infrared rays by the aliphatic C=C was detected at 1632 to 1637cm-1 and the aromatic C=C peak at 1610 to 1500 cm-1.The antimicrobial activity was evaluated using the microorganisms Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Actinomyces odontolyticus, with a disk diffusion method. Chlorhexidine digluconate solution 0.2% was used as a positive control. Zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed and measured. RESULTS: AdheSE showed the highest degree of conversion, followed by Excite, while Adper Prompt L-Pop had the lowest values. A significant difference in the degree of conversion was found between Excite and Adper Prompt L-Pop as well as AdheSE and Adper Prompt L-Pop. On the other hand, there was no significant difference between Excite and AdheSE. Adper Prompt L-Pop showed an antimicrobial effect against Streptococcus mutans and Actinomyces odontolyticus while it was unable to inhibit the growth of Lactobacillus salivarius. AdheSE could inhibit the growth of Streptococcus mutans only. Excite did not produce inhibition zones to the tested microorganisms. CONCLUSION: Adper Prompt L-Pop showed the worst degree of conversion. AdheSE and Excite had the highest degree of conversion. Appreciable antimicrobial activity was noted with self-etching adhesives, while the etch-and-rinse demonstrated no antimicrobial action.
TI  - DIAGNOdent measurements of cultures of selected oral bacteria and demineralized enamel.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Carious tissue fluoresces with a wavelength different from sound tissue when stimulated by light with a wavelength of 655 nm. This difference is thought to have a bacterial origin rather than indicating demineralization. This study aimed to measure fluorescence emitted by normal cultivable caries-associated bacterial flora and typical porphyrin-producing bacteria with DIAGNOdent, and to verify earlier findings that demineralization of the dental hard tissue does not affect DIAGNOdent readings. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bacterial samples were collected from five occlusal caries lesions in three subjects. From these, mixed anaerobic flora, Lactobacilli and mutans Streptococci were cultured in up to three different kinds of culture medium. Colonies of Lactobacilli and mutans Streptococci were also measured after transferring them to glass slides. Laboratory teaching strains of Prevotella spp., Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinomyces odontolyticus were cultured anaerobically and fluorescence measured directly after an appropriate incubation period. Sound enamel surfaces of 15 extracted premolars were demineralized and changes in fluorescence measured. RESULTS: DIAGNOdent readings > 20 were only obtained from young colonies of Prevotella and from colonies of mutans Streptococci cultured on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. Higher measurements were obtained as the bacterial colonies aged. Lower measurements were obtained after transferring colonies to glass slides. Demineralization of enamel did not affect the DIAGNOdent measurements. CONCLUSIONS: The change in fluorescence measured with DIAGNOdent has a bacterial origin rather than occurring as a result of demineralization. The measurements are presumably dependent on bacterial metabolites rather than bacteria themselves, and probably record synergistic effects during the carious process rather than the quantity or species of bacteria involved.
TI  - [Two cases of anaerobic empyema including Actinomyces].
AB  - We report 2 cases of empyema including Actinomyces spp. Case 1 was a 66-year-old  man with fever and left pleural effusion, Actinomyces israelii and 2 other microbes were isolated. Case 2 was a 52-year-old male inpatient who developed empyema during treatment of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Actinomyces odontolyticus and 3 other microbes were cultured in pleural effusion. Empyema caused by Actinomyces spp. is rare, in particular Actinomyces odontolyticus is rarely isolated and only 4 cases have been reported in Japan.
TI  - Emended description of Actinomyces naeslundii and descriptions of Actinomyces oris sp. nov. and Actinomyces johnsonii sp. nov., previously identified as Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, 2 and WVA 963.
AB  - Actinomyces naeslundii is an important early colonizer in the oral biofilm and consists of three genospecies (1, 2 and WVA 963) which cannot be readily differentiated using conventional phenotypic testing or on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We have investigated a representative collection of type and reference strains and clinical and oral isolates (n=115) and determined the partial gene sequences of six housekeeping genes (atpA, rpoB, pgi, metG, gltA and gyrA). These sequences identified the three genospecies and differentiated them from Actinomyces viscosus isolated from rodents. The partial sequences of atpA and metG gave best separation of the three genospecies. A. naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2 formed two distinct clusters, well separated from both genospecies WVA 963 and A. viscosus. Analysis of the same genes in other oral Actinomyces species (Actinomyces gerencseriae, A. israelii, A. meyeri, A. odontolyticus and A. georgiae) indicated that, when sequence data were obtained, these species each exhibited <90 % similarity with the A. naeslundii genospecies. Based on these data, we propose the name Actinomyces oris sp. nov. (type strain ATCC 27044(T) =CCUG 34288(T)) for A. naeslundii genospecies 2 and Actinomyces johnsonii sp. nov. (type strain ATCC 49338(T) =CCUG 34287(T)) for A. naeslundii genospecies WVA 963. A. naeslundii genospecies 1 should remain as A. naeslundii sensu stricto, with the type strain ATCC 12104(T) =NCTC 10301(T) =CCUG 2238(T).
TI  - Empyema thoracis due to actinomyces odontolyticus.
AB  - Actinomyces odontolyticus has been reported as an opportunistic pathogen causing  systemic infections. A case of empyema thoracis due to this organism in a 68-year-old male is reported here. The patient did not have any underlying disease or immunosuppression. The organism was isolated from his oral flora also. Eight cases of thoracopulmonary infections due to A. odontolyticus have been reported from the western countries, but none from India.
TI  - [Study the inhibitory effects of three oral actinomyces on growth of oral Candida albicans in vitro].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the three species of  oral Actinomyces have inhibitory effects on the growth of oral Candida albicans in vitro. METHODS: Straight o'clock method was used to observe the bacteriostasis circle. Reverse o'clock and mixed culture method were used to study the quantitative changes of Candida albicans colony respectively. RESULTS: (1) None of the groups had been viewed the bacteriostasis circle. (2) Compared with control groups, there was a significant decrease of Candida albicans colony on Actinomyces viscosus TPY soft agar (P < 0.05). Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces odontolyticus TPY soft agar were both devoid of obvious Candida albicans colony (P < 0.01). The former group (Actinomyces viscosus) and the two latter groups (Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces odontolyticus) showed a striking contrast (P < 0.01). (3) Compared with control groups, a decrease of Candida albicans showed up in the mixed culture, and the difference was significant (P < 0.05). The discrepancies among the three experimental groups were of no statistical value (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Oral Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces odontolyticus could inhibit the growth of Candida albicans in vitro. However, which of them contributed more to the inhibitory effects was still not affirmed.
TI  - Treatment of Eikenella corrodens and Actinomyces odontolyticus foot abscess in a  penicillin-allergic patient.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report a case of Eikenella corrodens and Actinomyces odontolyticus  foot abscess secondary to a toothpick puncture in a penicillin-allergic patient that was successfully treated with a long-term course of doxycycline. CASE SUMMARY: A 39-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus type 2 and hyperlipidemia presented with difficulty ambulating as well as pain and swelling of her right foot. Prior to presentation, she sustained a toothpick puncture to her right foot; she removed the toothpick intact and did not know whether it had been used. Due to a penicillin allergy, she began treatment with levofloxacin, which was changed to clindamycin one day later. The patient was diagnosed with right Achilles tendonitis/cellulitis and was discharged on a one-week course of clindamycin. Twenty-five days later she was readmitted, complaining of pain and swelling in the same area, which this time presented as an abscess. Upon this admission, vancomycin and levofloxacin were initiated and incision and drainage (I & D) was performed. Cultures and sensitivities from I & D were significant for E. corrodens and A. odontolyticus, and treatment was changed to intravenous doxycycline 100 mg every 12 hours for 10 weeks. Oral doxycycline 100 mg every 12 hours was then used for 3 months, and treatment was successful. DISCUSSION: E. corrodens and A. odontolyticus are 2 slow-growing organisms that are part of the normal oropharyngeal flora. Extraoral infections due to either of these organisms may be difficult to treat and might need lengthier treatments than are necessary for most infections. First-line treatment for such infections is penicillins and cephalosporins; however, in a patient with penicillin allergy, treatment options become limited, as there is potential cross-reactivity with other agents. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with infections secondary to E. corrodens and/or A. odontolyticus in whom penicillin allergy is a concern can be treated effectively with doxycycline.
TI  - MLPA diagnostics of complex microbial communities: relative quantification of bacterial species in oral biofilms.
AB  - A multitude of molecular methods are currently used for identification and characterization of oral biofilms or for community profiling. However, multiplex PCR techniques that are able to routinely identify several species in a single assay are not available. Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) identifies up to 45 unique fragments in a single tube PCR. Here we report a novel use of MLPA in the relative quantification of targeted microorganisms in a community of oral microbiota. We designed 9 species specific probes for: Actinomyces gerencseriae, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Candida albicans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Rothia dentocariosa, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis and Veillonella parvula; and genus specific probes for selected oral Streptococci and Lactobacilli based on their 16S rDNA sequences. MLPA analysis of DNA pooled from the strains showed the expected specific MLPA products. Relative quantification of a serial dilution of equimolar DNA showed that as little as 10 pg templates can be detected with clearly discernible signals. Moreover, a 2 to 7% divergence in relative signal ratio of amplified probes observed from normalized peak area values suggests MLPA can be a cheaper alternative to using qPCR for quantification. We observed 2 to 6 fold fluctuations in signal intensities of MLPA products in DNAs isolated from multispecies biofilms grown in various media for various culture times. Furthermore, MLPA analyses of DNA isolated from saliva obtained from different donors gave a varying number and intensity of signals. This clearly shows the usefulness of MLPA in a quantitative description of microbial shifts.
TI  - Molecular identification of bacteria on the tongue dorsum of subjects with and without halitosis.
AB  - AIM: Compare the microbial profiles on the tongue dorsum in patients with halitosis and control subjects in a UK population using culture-independent techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Halitosis patients were screened according to our recently developed recruitment protocol. Scrapings from the tongue dorsum were obtained for 12 control subjects and 20 halitosis patients. Bacteria were identified by PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. RESULTS: The predominant species found in the control samples were Lysobacter-type species, Streptococcus salivarius, Veillonella dispar, unidentified oral bacterium, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Atopobium parvulum and Veillonella atypica. In the halitosis samples, Lysobacter-type species, S. salivarius, Prevotella melaninogenica, unidentified oral bacterium, Prevotella veroralis and Prevotella pallens were the most commonly found species. For the control samples, 13-16 (4.7-5.8%) of 276 clones represented uncultured species, whereas in the halitosis samples, this proportion increased to 6.5-9.6% (36-53 of 553 clones). In the control samples, 22 (8.0%) of 276 clones represented potentially novel phylotypes, and in the halitosis samples, this figure was 39 (7.1%) of 553 clones. CONCLUSIONS: The microflora associated with the tongue dorsum is complex in both the control and halitosis groups, but several key species predominate in both groups.
TI  - [Study of the relationship between oral Actinomyces and childhood caries].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Actinomyces are members of the indigenous oral microbiota which have been implicated in root caries, but their role in childhood caries initiation and progression is not well-understood. The distribution of Actinomyces in supragingival plaque on the primary teeth and the relationship between oral Actinomyces spp. and childhood caries primarily were investigated. METHODS: Forty children aged from three to five years old were divided into two groups. Twenty children were caries-free and twenty were caries-susceptible. Dental plaque samples from different places of the teeth were collected with sterile toothpick and polymerase chain reaction was performed with specific primers which were designed for this research. RESULTS: Actinomyces spp. were detected 100% in the caries-free group, while 95% in the caries-susceptible group. There was no significant differences between the two groups (P > 0.05). Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Actinomyces gerencseriae, Actinomyces israelii and Actinomyces viscosus all could be detected in both groups. The prevalence of Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces gerencseriae and Actinomyces odontolyticus were higher in caries-free group than those in caries-susceptible group (P < 0.05), while the prevalence of Actinomyces israelii and Actinomyces viscosus had no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Actinomyces is the main colonized bacteria in the supragingival plaque of children. The prevalence of the Actinomyces spp. may have a negative relationship with the childhood caries, and has nothing to do with different places of the teeth.
TI  - Bacterial composition and red fluorescence of plaque in relation to primary and secondary caries next to composite: an in situ study.
AB  - BACKGROUND/HYPOTHESIS: Secondary caries has been suggested as the main reason for restoration replacement. We hypothesized that more caries-associated bacteria are found on composite resin restoration material, compared to sound tooth tissue. METHODS: Both restored and unrestored dentin and enamel samples were placed in a full denture of eight subjects for 20 weeks. The microbiological composition of approximal plaque and the association between caries-associated bacteria and red autofluorescence of dental plaque was studied. Every 4 weeks the specimens were microradiographed using transversal wavelength independent microradiography (T-WIM). After 1 and 20 weeks red fluorescence pictures and plaque samples were taken. Samples were cultured for total anaerobic counts, mutans streptococci, lactobacilli, candida and Actinomyces odontolyticus. RESULTS: Lesion depth in the dentin and enamel was positively associated with lactobacilli, and lesion depth in dentin was positively associated with A. odontolyticus, whereas no association was found between mutans streptococci and lesion depth. The red-fluorescent bacteria A. odontolyticus and lactobacilli did not correlate with red-fluorescent plaque, indicating that red fluorescence is probably not caused by a single species of these bacteria. After 20 weeks, a higher proportion of combined mutans streptococci and lactobacilli was found on restored tissue compared to non-restored tissue (P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: The higher proportion of caries-associated bacteria on restored tissue indicates that the ecology on the surface of primary lesions differs from that on lesions next to composite, and that secondary caries next to composite may differ from the primary caries process.
TI  - Facial actinomycosis mimicking a desmoid tumour: case report.
AB  - Actinomycosis is a chronic, suppurative, granulomatous, fibrosing infection that  usually occurs in the cervicofacial region. Actinomyces israelii is the most common organism, with sporadic cases being caused by A. odontolyticus. Even though actinomyces are part of the normal oral flora, infections are rare; rarer still is actinomycotic infection of the facial skin. We describe a case of actinomycosis of the skin of the chin, which histologically mimicked a desmoid tumour.
TI  - The effect of antibacterial monomer MDPB on the growth of organisms associated with root caries.
AB  - MDPB, 12-methacryloyloxydodecylpyridinium bromide, was tested for its ability to  inhibit the growth of organisms associated with active root caries lesions and to modify the growth characteristics of these organisms at sub-MICs. MICs and MBCs of MDPB for independent isolates (n=5) of the following taxa: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus salivarius, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces gerensceriae, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Lactobacillus spp., and Candida albicans were determined, and the effects at sub-MIC on microbial growth kinetics were assessed. All isolates were sensitive to inhibition by MDPB. The median MICs and MBCs of MDPB for these organisms were in the range of 3.13 to 25.0 microg/ml and 6.25 to 50.0 microg/ml, respectively. As for the influence of pH, inhibition was sensitive to acidic pH. Even at sub-MICs, the growth of all strains, measured as cell yield and doubling time, was significantly reduced. Based on the results of this study, MDPB exhibited the potential to inhibit the growth of microbiota associated with active root caries lesions.
TI  - Actinomycotic bacteraemia after dental procedures.
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess role of oral flora in causing bacteraemia following dental manipulations. METHODS: Fifty patients undergoing dental manipulations were assessed to study the incidence and nature of bacteraemia following dental procedures with special emphasis on Actinomyces. RESULTS: Incidence of bacteraemia was seen to be 80% of which Actinomycotic bacteraemia was found to be 30 %. Common species of Actinomyces isolated were A. viscosus (58.33 %), A. odontolyticus (8.33 %) and A. naeslundi (8.33 %). Aerobic bacteraemia was seen in 48% patients. Common aerobes isolated from bacteraemia following dental procedures were alpha haemolytic streptococci (25.93 %) and diphtheroides (20.38 %). Anaerobic bacteraemia was seen in 6% patients. Common Anaerobes isolated were Peptostreptococcus spp (33.32 %), Prevotella spp. (16.66%) and Bacteroides spp (16.66%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteraemia was present in 26 % of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Actinomycotic bacteraemia was more commonly seen in patients with periodontal infections. Thus, prophylactic measures need to be instituted in such patients to prevent cervicofacial, thoracic or abdominal Actinomycosis developing later on.
TI  - False positive PCR detection of Tropheryma whipplei in the saliva of healthy people.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tropheryma whipplei, the agent of Whipple's disease (WD), has been recently isolated and the genomes of two isolates have been fully sequenced. Previous diagnosis tools for the diagnosis of the disease used sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene. Using this target gene, the high percentage of detection of the bacterium in saliva of healthy people was in contrast to the negative results obtained with specific target genes. The aim of our study was to compare previously published primers targeting the 16S rRNA gene to real-time PCR with Taqman* probes targeting specific repeat genes only found in the genome of T. whipplei in a series of 57 saliva from healthy people. RESULTS: Although the specific real-time PCR assays with both primers and probes were negative for all the samples, 13 out of 57 samples were positive with different primers previously reported targeting the 16S rRNA gene. Among the positive samples, 8 yielded a 231-bp sequence that was 99.1% identical to that of Actinomyces odontolyticus, 2 yielded a 226-bp that was 99.6% identical to that of A. turicensis, and 3 yielded a 160-bp sequence that was 98.5% identical to that of Capnocytophaga gingivalis. We found that the C. gingivalis and A. odontolyticus 16S rRNA sequences obtained in our study share more than 80% homology with the corresponding 16S rRNA sequences of the T. whipplei genomes especially at 5' and 3' end. CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic carriers of T. whipplei in saliva may exist but their prevalence is much lower than those previously reported. Testing the specificity of designed primers is critical to avoid false positive detection of T. whipplei. In atypical case we recommend to test two different specific target genes before concluding.
TI  - In vitro activity of amoxicillin, clindamycin, doxycycline, metronidazole, and moxifloxacin against oral Actinomyces.
AB  - Actinomyces spp have been increasingly associated with endodontic infections. However, the antimicrobial susceptibility of this genus has not been studied extensively. The objective of this study was to determine the susceptibility of oral isolates of Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces gerencseriae, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces viscosus, and Actinomyces odontolyticus to amoxicillin, clindamycin, doxycycline, metronidazole, and moxifloxacin using in vitro assays. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each bacterial isolate was determined by using E-test strips (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden). The MIC(90) was 0.19 microg/mL for amoxicillin, 0.25 microg/mL for doxycycline, 0.50 microg/mL for moxifloxacin, and 1.00 microg/mL for clindamycin. However, metronidazole was not active against any of the Actinomyces spp tested (MIC(90)>256 microg/mL).
TI  - [Actinomyces odontolyticus isolation during prosthetic aortic graft infection with paraprosthetic duodenal fistula].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Prosthetic vascular graft infection is a rare complication of vascular surgery. We report a case with graft enteric fistula and Actinomyces odontolyticus bacteremia. EXEGESIS: A 73 year-old man with a prosthetic aortic graft and who had a parodontal disease, has been hospitalised for fever of unknown origin. Blood cultures grew with Escherichia coli and Actinomyces odontolyticus. The imaging studies indicated graft infection. Laparotomy has confirmed the diagnosis and highlighted a polymicrobial infection and a paraprosthetic duodenal fistula. A review of the literature's data concerning prosthetic vascular graft infections is made. The role of Actinomyces odontolyticus in that case is discussed. CONCLUSION: Prosthetic aortic graft infection due to graft enteric fistula is usually a polymicrobial infection and is a late complication of aortic surgery. Imaging is essential for the diagnosis of prosthetic aortic graft infection. It is possible that Actinomyces odontolyticus has contributed to prosthesis infection in this case.
TI  - Effect of 308-nm excimer laser light on peri-implantitis-associated bacteria: an  in vitro investigation.
AB  - Dental implants are becoming increasingly important in prosthodontic rehabilitation. Bacterial infections, however, can induce bone loss and jeopardize clinical success. Recent literature has demonstrated that infrared CO(2) laser light is suitable for the decontamination of exposed implant surfaces. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of 308-nm excimer laser irradiation on peri-implantitis-associated bacteria in vitro. In this study, a XeCl excimer laser (308 nm) was used (Summit Technology, Boston, USA). Both aerobe (Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii) and anaerobe microorganisms (A. odontolyticus, Prevotella melaninogenica) were tested. According to previous studies, a constant energy of 0.8 J/cm(2) and a constant frequency of 20 Hz were used for all irradiations. Colony-forming units after laser irradiation were counted. Excimer laser irradiation showed significant influence on the growth of all microorganisms. As compared to S. mutans and S. sanguis, A. naeslundii demonstrated higher sensitivity to laser irradiation. Anaerobe microorganisms, in contrast, demonstrated that a total of 200 pulses were sufficient to reduce the replication of these germs for more than 99.9%. Excimer laser irradiation (lambda = 308 nm) can significantly reduce both aerobe and anaerobe microorganisms. Depending on the parameters chosen, 200 pulses are sufficient for sterilization. New studies are necessary to evaluate if this wavelength is more of value in the treatment of peri-implantitis than other wavelengths or conventional therapies.
TI  - Red autofluorescence of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  - Red autofluorescence of plaque and its relation to fluorescence of a single species in the biofilm was studied. Fluorescence images of non-disclosed and disclosed plaque of 28 first-year students were captured. The plaque samples were assessed by culture methods and studied for red autofluorescence. Species capable of producing red autofluorescence were cultivated from subjects with and without red plaque autofluorescence. Red autofluorescence was observed from Actinomyces odontolyticus, Prevotella intermedia and from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Peptostreptococcus micros grown together. The microbial findings indicated that the intrinsic characteristics of the mature biofilm itself are more responsible for the red autofluorescence than the characteristics of the single species.
TI  - Antimicrobial therapy using a local drug delivery system (Arestin) in the treatment of peri-implantitis. I: Microbiological outcomes.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the microbiological outcome of local administration of minocycline hydrochloride microspheres 1 mg (Arestin) in cases with peri-implantitis and with a follow-up period of 12 months. MATERIAL AND METHODS: After debridement, and local administration of chlorhexidine gel, peri-implantitis cases were treated with local administration of minocycline microspheres (Arestin). The DNA-DNA checkerboard hybridization method was used to detect bacterial presence during the first 360 days of therapy. RESULTS: At Day 10, lower bacterial loads for 6/40 individual bacteria including Actinomyces gerensceriae (P<0.1), Actinomyces israelii (P<0.01), Actinomyces naeslundi type 1 (P<0.01) and type 2 (P<0.03), Actinomyces odontolyticus (P<0.01), Porphyromonas gingivalis (P<0.01) and Treponema socranskii (P<0.01) were found. At Day 360 only the levels of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were lower than at baseline (mean difference: 1x10(5); SE difference: 0.34x10(5), 95% CI: 0.2x10(5) to 1.2x10(5); P<0.03). Six implants were lost between Days 90 and 270. The microbiota was successfully controlled in 48%, and with definitive failures (implant loss and major increase in bacterial levels) in 32% of subjects. CONCLUSIONS: At study endpoint, the impact of Arestin on A. actinomycetemcomitans was greater than the impact on other pathogens. Up to Day 180 reductions in levels of Tannerella forsythia, P. gingivalis, and Treponema denticola were also found. Failures in treatment could not be associated with the presence of specific pathogens or by the total bacterial load at baseline. Statistical power analysis suggested that a case control study would require approximately 200 subjects.
TI  - Characterization of Actinomyces species isolated from failed dental implant fixtures.
AB  - In the oral cavity, Actinomyces form a fundamental component of the indigenous microflora, being among initial colonizers in polymicrobial biofilms. However, some differences may exist between different species in terms of their attachment not only to teeth but also to biomaterials. In this study we investigated the distribution of Actinomyces in 33 dental implant fixtures explanted from 17 patients. The identification was based on comprehensive biochemical testing and gas-liquid chromatography and when needed, 16S rRNA sequencing. Actinomyces was the most prevalent bacterial genus in these failed implants, colonizing 31/33 (94%) of the fixtures. Proportions of Actinomyces growth of the total bacterial growth in the Actinomyces-positive fixtures varied from 0.01% up to 75%. A. odontolyticus was the most common Actinomyces finding, present in 26/31 (84%) Actinomyces-positive fixtures. Actinomyces naeslundii and A. viscosus were both detected in 10/31 (32%) and A. israelii in 7/31 (23%) fixtures. Other Actinomyces species, including A. georgiae, A. gerencseriae and A. graevenitzii, were detected less frequently. Our results suggest that Actinomyces species are frequent colonizers on failed implant surfaces, where A. odontolyticus was the far most prominent Actinomyces species.
TI  - Sequence analyses of fimbriae subunit FimA proteins on Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2 and Actinomyces odontolyticus with variant carbohydrate binding specificities.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2 express type-2 fimbriae (FimA subunit polymers) with variant Galbeta binding specificities and Actinomyces odontolyticus a sialic acid specificity to colonize different oral surfaces. However, the fimbrial nature of the sialic acid binding property and sequence information about FimA proteins from multiple strains are lacking. RESULTS: Here we have sequenced fimA genes from strains of A.naeslundii genospecies 1 (n = 4) and genospecies 2 (n = 4), both of which harboured variant Galbeta-dependent hemagglutination (HA) types, and from A.odontolyticus PK984 with a sialic acid-dependent HA pattern. Three unique subtypes of FimA proteins with 63.8-66.4% sequence identity were present in strains of A. naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2 and A. odontolyticus. The generally high FimA sequence identity (> 97.2%) within a genospecies revealed species specific sequences or segments that coincided with binding specificity. All three FimA protein variants contained a signal peptide, pilin motif, E box, proline-rich segment and an LPXTG sorting motif among other conserved segments for secretion, assembly and sorting of fimbrial proteins. The highly conserved pilin, E box and LPXTG motifs are present in fimbriae proteins from other Gram-positive bacteria. Moreover, only strains of genospecies 1 were agglutinated with type-2 fimbriae antisera derived from A. naeslundii genospecies 1 strain 12104, emphasizing that the overall folding of FimA may generate different functionalities. Western blot analyses with FimA antisera revealed monomers and oligomers of FimA in whole cell protein extracts and a purified recombinant FimA preparation, indicating a sortase-independent oligomerization of FimA. CONCLUSION: The genus Actinomyces involves a diversity of unique FimA proteins with conserved pilin, E box and LPXTG motifs, depending on subspecies and associated binding specificity. In addition, a sortase independent oligomerization of FimA subunit proteins in solution was indicated.
TI  - A case of pulmonary actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces odontolyticus from India.
AB  
TI  - [Disseminated actinomycosis].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: We report the case of a patient suffering from disseminated actinomycosis. CASE REPORT: A fifty-two year old man, who was both a heavy smoker and an alcoholic, was admitted to hospital with confusion associated with a pseudo-tumoral right upper lobe pneumonia. Brain computed tomography was normal on the day of admission but when repeated fifteen days later four lesions were seen with appearances suspicious of metastatic malignant disease. The isolation of Actinomyces odontolyticus in the bronchoalveolar lavage culture and the absence of evidence for neoplastic disease despite extensive investigation led to a diagnosis of disseminated actinomycosis with pulmonary and cerebral involvement. The patient's clinical condition improved with antibiotic therapy. The disseminated form of this infection as well as presentation with multifocal brain abscesses is rare. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of actinomycosis is problematic because it is an uncommon infection and microbiological identification is often difficult and delayed. It should be considered when clinical presentation suggests malignant disease but there is no histological confirmation.
TI  - In vivo evaluation of the effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on salivary bacteria using the checkerboard method.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on different species of the oral microbiota. METHODOLOGY: Saliva samples were collected from 20 subjects with good oral health, diluted and plated onto blood agar medium. The subjects were asked to place the strip (Listerine PocketPaks) on the tongue allowing it to dissolve. After 30 minutes, new saliva samples were collected again and the plates with the samples were incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees C for seven days. Colony counts (CFU/mL) were determined for each sample. The colonies on the plates were washed with 1 mL of TE buffer, and the bacterial suspensions were processed for the identification of 24 species by DNA probes and the Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. Differences in total counts, prevalence, and levels of the species evaluated before and after placement of the strips were determined by Wilcoxon sign rank and Chi-square tests. RESULTS: A modest increase in the total bacterial number in saliva from 1.4 x 10(8) to 1.7 x 10(8) bacterial cells was observed 30 minutes after the strip placement, although this change was not significant (p = 0.632). Most of the species reduced in frequency and/or levels, including the pathogens A. actinomycetemcomitans, C. rectus, E. corrodens, Fusobacterium spp., P. intermedia, and S. noxia, as well as the beneficial species A. meyeri, A. georgia, A. gerencseriae, A. odontolyticus, and P. acnes after strip placement. In contrast, A. viscosus, P. melaninogenica, P. gingivalis, P. micros, Streptococcus spp., T. forsythensis, and V. parvula presented an increase in prevalence and/or levels. These changes were not statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons (p > 0.0022). CONCLUSION: The use of the essential oil-containing oral strips resulted in a short-term small increase in the total number of salivary microorganisms. In addition, a not significant decrease of certain periodontopathogens, and an increase in species compatible with oral health were observed.
TI  - [A case of pulmonary actinomycosis, who expectorated sulfur granules, caused by Actinomyces odontolyticus and Actinomyces meyeri].
AB  - A 51-year-old man complaining of cough and bloody sputum, was admitted to our hospital because of antibiotic-resistant chronic pneumonia in the right upper lobe. Initially, bronchoscopic examination and sputum culture revealed no evidence of malignancy or any specific infection, either pathologically or microbiologically. However, pathological examination of a solid body expectorated with sputum revealed typical sulfur granules, indicating pulmonary actinomycosis. Two actinomyceses named Actinomyces odontolyticus and Actinomyces meyeri were detected later. Pulmonary infection caused by these types of actinomyceses is rare, and the diagnostic procedure seemed to be unusual.
TI  - Microarrays complement culture methods for identification of bacteria in endodontic infections.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the microbial composition of necrotic root canals using culture methods and microarray technology. Twenty uniradicular teeth with radiographic evidence of periapical bone loss and with no previous endodontic treatment were selected for this study. For molecular diagnosis a DNA chip with 20 different species-specific, 16S-rDNA-directed catcher probes was used. The microorganisms most frequently detected by the DNA chip were: Micromonas micros, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp., Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, Veillonella parvula, Eubacterium nodatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinomyces odontolyticus, and Streptococcus constellatus. As expected, additional important bacterial taxa were found by culture analysis, but microorganisms such as T. forsythia and T. denticola could not be identified. In conclusion, microarrays may provide significant additional information regarding the endodontic microbiota by detecting bacterial species that are otherwise difficult or impossible to culture.
TI  - Evaluation of bacterial nitrate reduction in the human oral cavity.
AB  - It is hypothesized that the enterosalivary nitrate circulation encourages nitrate reducing bacteria to reside within the oral cavity. Nitrite production may then limit the growth of acidogenic bacteria as a result of the production of antimicrobial oxides of nitrogen, including nitric oxide. This study was carried out with 10 subjects to characterize oral nitrate reduction and identify the bacteria responsible. Nitrate reduction varied between individuals (mean 85.4 +/- 15.9 nmol nitrite min(-1) with 10 ml 1 mm KNO(3) mouth wash) and was found to be concentrated at the rear of the tongue dorsal surface. Nitrate reductase positive isolates identified, using 16S rDNA sequencing, from the tongue comprised Veillonella atypica (34%), Veillonella dispar (24%), Actinomyces odontolyticus (21%), Actinomyces naeslundii (2%), Rothia mucilaginosa (10%), Rothia dentocariosa (3%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (5%). Nitrite production rates, using intact and permeabilized cells, of the major tongue nitrate reducers were determined in the presence of methyl and benzyl viologen. Under anaerobic conditions in the presence of nitrate, rates in decreasing order were: A. odontolyticus > R. mucilaginosa > R. dentocariosa > V. dispar > V. atypica. In conclusion, Veillonella spp. were found to be the most prevalent taxa isolated and thus may make a major contribution to nitrate reduction in the oral cavity.
TI  - Exit-site infection caused by Actinomyces odontolyticus in a CAPD patient.
AB  
TI  - Molecular evaluation of residual endodontic microorganisms after instrumentation, irrigation and medication with either calcium hydroxide or Septomixine.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The correct choice of antimicrobial agents as inter-appointment medicaments is as important as the instrumentation and irrigation to remove pathogens from infected root canals. Calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2] and framycetin sulfate (Septomixine) are common endodontic medicaments. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy of either calcium hydroxide or Septomixine in eliminating residual intra-canal bacteria, particularly Actinomyces spp., during inter-appointment interval in endodontic therapy using molecular methods. METHODS: A total of 31 single-rooted teeth with primary root canal infections were studied immediately after opening the canals and subsequently after instrumentation, irrigation with sterile saline and 1-week medication with either Ca(OH)2 (n = 25) or Septomixine (n = 6). Whole bacterial genomic DNA was isolated directly from samples and PCR with universal primers performed to detect total intra-canal bacteria. The variable regions of 16S rDNA of bacteria were amplified and labeled with digoxigenin for further hybridization to detect Actinomyces spp. A total of seven oligonucleotide probes specific for A. bovis, A. gerencseriae, A. israelii, A. meyeri, catalase-negative A. naeslundii (genospecies 1 and 2), catalase-positive A. naeslundii genospecies 2 and A. odontolyticus were used to detect Actinomyces spp. in 22 of 31 medicated root canals [Ca(OH)2: n = 17; Septomixine: n = 5]. RESULTS: The PCR results showed that 25 of 31 examined canals were positively detected with residual microorganisms after instrumentation, irrigation with sterile saline and 1-week medication with either Ca(OH)2 (n = 20) or Septomixine (n = 5). Thus, only six canals [Ca(OH)2: n = 5, Septomixine: n = 1] were aseptic after treatment. Hybridization results showed higher detection frequency of both A. odontolyticus and A. gerencseriae after treatment. Significant correlation was found between exposed pulp before treatment and positive detection of Actinomyces spp., particularly A. odontolyticus on the second visit (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The conventional, 1-week medication of either Ca(OH)2 or Septomixine in endodontic therapy may not effectively inhibit residual bacterial growth in all root canals during inter-appointment intervals. Further investigations using, for instance quantitative real-time PCR analyses, are required to substantiate the present findings.
TI  - Direct detection of cell surface interactive forces of sessile, fimbriated and non-fimbriated Actinomyces spp. using atomic force microscopy.
AB  - Actinomyces species are predominant early colonizers of the oral cavity and prime mediators of inter-bacterial adhesion and coaggregation. Previous workers have evaluated the adhesion of Actinomyces spp. by quantitative assessment of sessile, as opposed to planktonic cells attached to substrates, but did not quantify the cell surface interactive forces. Therefore we used atomic force microscopy to directly detect the interactive force between an approaching silicon tip and sessile Actinomyces spp. adhering to a substrate, at nanonewton (nN) range force levels. A total of eight strains each belonging to fimbriated and non-fimbriated Actinomyces species were employed, namely A. bovis, A. gerencseriae, A. israelii, A. meyeri, A. naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2, A. odontolyticus and A. viscosus. The sterile mica discs, used as the adhesion substrate, were immersed in mono-species bacterial suspensions for five days to obtain a thin bacterial biofilm. Interactive forces were measured using a silicon nitride cantilever attached to a Nanoscope IIIA atomic force microscope. The interactive forces between the approaching silicon nitride tip and bacterial biofilm surfaces were randomly quantified at three different locations on each cell; namely, the cell surface proper, the periphery of the cell and the substrate and, the interface between two cells. When the interactive forces at these locations of the same species were compared, significantly higher force levels at the cell-cell interface than the other two locations were noted with A. gerencseriae (P < 0.001), A. viscosus (P < 0.01) and A. israelii (P < 0.05). When the interactive forces of different Actinomyces spp. at an identical location were compared, fimbriated A. naeslundii genospecies 2 showed the greatest interactive force at the cell surface proper (-32.6 +/- 8.7 nN, P < 0.01). A. naeslundii genospecies 1, 2 and A. viscosus demonstrated greater interactive force at the cell-mica periphery than the other five species (P < 0.05); A. viscosus (-34.6 +/- 10.5 nN) displayed greater interactive force at the cell-cell interface than the others (P < 0.01), except for A. gerencseriae (P > 0.05). These data indicate that fimbriated Actinomyces spp., including A. naeslundii genospecies 1, 2 and A. viscosus exert higher cell surface interactive forces than those devoid of fimbriae and, such variable force levels may modulate their adhesion and coaggregation during biofilm formation.
TI  - [Analysis of oral microflora early colonized in infants].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the dynamic changes of oral microflora early colonized in infants. METHODS: The oral swab samples for the study were taken in 1 day, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 months after birth from 12 healthy neonates. By choosing suitable diluted concentration, the samples were incubated aerobically, facultative anaerobically and anaerobically. The strains were identified by observing colony characteristics, Gram staining and biochemical tests. RESULTS: S. salivarius was the most frequent microflora, followed by S. mitis, S. sanguis, S. gordonii and S. mutans occurred in oral cavity after tooth eruption. Veillonella spp. can be detected in oral cavity of 1-month-old babies, A. odontolyticus was isolated from 8.3% infants of more than 3 months old. L. acidophilus maintained the lower prevalence in oral cavity of babies. Leptotrichia buccalis and Capnocytophaga spp. occurred in oral cavity of some dentate infants. CONCLUSION: S. solivarius and S. mitis are predominant species in oral cavity of the infants, Veillonella spp. is the first and the most anaerobic species appeared in oral cavity of healthy babies. A. odontolyticus is the first actinomyces detected in oral cavity. With the increasing months, kind and amount of microflora increase dramatically.
TI  - The effects of chlorhexidine gluconate (0.12%) on the antimicrobial properties of tooth-colored ProRoot mineral trioxide aggregate.
AB  - The purpose of this in vitro study was to determine whether the substitution of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for sterile water as a mixing agent would enhance the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored ProRoot mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) against Actinomyces odontolyticus (ATCC17982), Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC2586), Streptococcus sanguis (ATCC10556), Enterococcus faecalis (ER3/2S), Escherichia coli (SM10lambdapir), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC6538), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (UME), and Candida albicans (ATCC10261). Two wells of 5-mm diameter were made in triplicate agar plates inoculated with standardized suspensions of each microorganism. MTA (33 mg) mixed with chlorhexidine (12 microl) or sterile water (12 microl) was placed to fill each well. Plates were incubated at 37 degrees C as required for microbial growth. A blinded, independent observer measured zones of inhibition. All MTA samples inhibited microbial growth regardless of mixing agent. MTA/chlorhexidine showed significantly larger zones of inhibition (p < 0.0002, paired t test). In conclusion, substituting 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for water enhanced the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored ProRoot MTA.
TI  - Study of humoral immunity to commensal oral bacteria in human infants demonstrates the presence of secretory immunoglobulin A antibodies reactive with Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2 ribotypes.
AB  - The mouths of three human infants were examined from birth to age 2 years to detect colonization of Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2. These bacteria did not colonize until after tooth eruption. The diversity of posteruption isolates was determined by ribotyping. Using immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we determined the reactivity of secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) antibodies in saliva samples collected from each infant before and after colonization against cell wall proteins from their own A. naeslundii strains and carbohydrates from standard A. naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2 strains. A. naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2 carbohydrate-reactive SIgA antibodies were not detected in any saliva sample. However, SIgA antibodies reactive with cell wall proteins were present in saliva before these bacteria colonized the mouth. These antibodies could be almost completely removed by absorption with A. odontolyticus, a species known to colonize the human mouth shortly after birth. However, after colonization by A. naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2, specific antibodies were induced that could not be removed by absorption with A. odontolyticus. Cluster analysis of the patterns of reactivity of postcolonization salivary antibodies from each infant with antigens from their own strains showed that not only could these antibodies discriminate among strains but antibodies in saliva samples collected at different times showed different reactivity patterns. Overall, these data suggest that, although much of the salivary SIgA antibodies reactive with A. naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2 are directed against genus-specific or more broadly cross-reactive antigens, species, genospecies, and possibly strain-specific antibodies are induced in response to colonization.
TI  - Actinomyces odontolyticus bacteremia.
AB  - We describe two immunosuppressed female patients with fever and Actinomyces odontolyticus bacteremia, a combination documented once previously in an immunocompetent male patient. The patients were treated with doxycycline and clindamycin; these drugs, with beta-lactams, are effective treatment for A. odontolyticus infections.
TI  - Soft-tissue abscess involving Actinomyces odontolyticus and two Prevotella species in an intravenous drug abuser.
AB  - Skin and soft-tissue infections in intravenous users comprise a variety of microorganisms and anaerobic bacteria are frequently involved in these suppurative infections. A case of subcutaneous abscess into anterior femoral muscles involving Actinomyces odontolyticus and two Prevotella species (Prevotella buccae and Prevotella melaninogenica) in an intravenous drug abuser is presented. This combination of microorganisms has not previously been described in soft-tissue infections. The patient volunteering that he licked his hypodermic needle prior to cocaine injection supports that the implicating bacteria originated from the oral cavity. Eventually, the patient recovered and at a 6-month follow-up a gradual improvement of his subcutaneous infection was noticed.
TI  - Frozen cancellous bone allografts: positive cultures of implanted grafts in posterior fusions of the spine.
AB  - We have carried out a study on the behaviour pattern of implanted allografts initially stored in perfect conditions (aseptically processed, culture-negative and stored at -80 degrees C) but which presented positive cultures at the implantation stage. There is no information available on how to deal with this type of situation, so our aim was to set guidelines on the course of action which would be required in such a case. This was a retrospective study of 112 patients who underwent a spinal arthrodesis and in whom a total of 189 allograft pieces were used. All previous bone and blood cultures and tests for hepatitis B and C, syphilis and HIV (via PCR techniques) were negative. The allografts were stored by freezing them at -80 degrees C. A sample of the allograft was taken for culture in the operating theatre just before its implantation in all cases. The results of the cultures were obtained 3-5 days after the operation. There were 22 allografts with positive culture results (12%) after implantation. These allografts were implanted in 16 patients (14%). Cultures were positive for staphylococci coagulase negative (ECN) in 10 grafts (46%), Pseudomonas stutzeri in two grafts (9%), Corynebacterium jeikeium in two grafts (9%), staphylococci coagulase positive in two grafts (9%) and for each of the following organisms in one case each (4%): Corynebacterium spp., Actinomyces odontolyticus, Streptococcus mitis, Peptostreptococcus spp., Rhodococcus equi and Bacillus spp. No clinical infection was seen in any of these patients. Positive cultures could be caused by non-detected contamination at harvesting, storing or during manipulation before implantation. The lack of clinical signs of infection during the follow-up of our patients may indicate that no specific treatment different from our antibiotic protocol is required in the case of positive culture results of a graft piece after implantation.
TI  - Direct detection of Actinomyces spp. from infected root canals in a Chinese population: a study using PCR-based, oligonucleotide-DNA hybridization technique.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The poor sensitivity of phenotypic identification techniques has hampered the taxonomic differentiation of Actinomyces. Hence we developed a sensitive and specific, PCR-based oligonucleotide-DNA hybridization technique to detect Actinomyces spp. and, used this method to detect these organisms in samples directly obtained from infected root canals. METHODS: A total of 32 samples from 28 Chinese patients, with primary root canal infections, aseptically exposed at the first patient visit, were studied. Whole bacterial genomic DNA was isolated directly from paper point samples. The variable regions of 16S ribosomal DNA of bacteria were amplified and labeled with digoxigenin for further hybridization and detection. A total of seven oligonucleotide probes specific for A. bovis, A. gerencseriae, A. israelii, A. meyeri, catalase-negative A. naeslundii (genospecies 1 and 2), catalase-positive A. naeslundii genospecies 2 and A. odontolyticus were used. RESULTS: 16 of the 32 teeth were infected with one or more Actinomyces species. The prevalence rates of the examined species were: A. odontolyticus 31.3%, A. meyeri 9.4%, A. naeslundii 9.4%, A. israelii 6.3% and A. gerencseriae 3.1%; no A. bovis was detected in any of the canals. Furthermore, A. odontolyticus was isolated more frequently from root canals with caries or a history of caries (Fisher's exact test: P=0.0496; Odds ratio=9.00, 95% confidence interval: 0.97-83.63), and A. naeslundii was significantly associated with traumatized teeth (Fisher's exact test: P=0.0121; Odds ratio=57.00, 95% confidence interval: 2.10-1546.90). However, no significant correlation was found between Actinomyces spp. and clinical symptoms and signs, such as pain, swelling, percussion to tenderness, sinus and periapical radiolucency. CONCLUSION: Actinomyces spp. may be important pathogens of root canal infections. A. naeslundii in particular may be related with traumatized teeth. A. odontolyticus appears to be involved in infections related to caries, exposure of dentinal tubules during cavity preparation and/or leaking restoration, but further clarification with large samples is necessary.
TI  - Development of novel oligonucleotide probes for seven Actinomyces species and their utility in supragingival plaque analysis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The traditional, biochemical and enzymatic methods of identifying Actinomyces species are frequently confounded by the similar phenotypic characteristics shared by the different members of this genus. Therefore, we developed novel species-specific oligonucleotide probes to accurately speciate seven pathogenic Actinomyces species, namely, Actinomyces bovis, A. gerencseriae, A. israelii, A. meyeri, A. naeslundii, A. odontolyticus and A. viscosus. METHODS: A pair of universal primers and seven 15- to 19-base oligonucleotide probes with a tail of 20 thymidines on the 5' end were developed. The variable regions of 16S ribosomal DNA of 36 strains of Actinomyces belonging to the above species were amplified and labeled with digoxigenin, and an oligonucleotide-DNA hybridization assay was performed to examine the specificity and sensitivity of these probes. RESULTS: All seven, newly developed probes were specific and sensitive, and accurately detected 36 reference and wild type strains belonging to Actinomyces species, without cross-reactions. The probe for A. naeslundii detected all strains belonging to the genospecies 1 (12 strains) and catalase-negative genospecies 2 (four strains); it failed to detect catalase-positive A. naeslundii genospecies 2 (previous A. viscosus serotype II) (two strains). However, the latter strains of catalase-positive A. naeslundii genospecies 2 were correctly detected by the probe developed for A. viscosus. The new probes were then field tested using supragingival plaque samples from 28 healthy preschool children. Whilst A. odontolyticus was detected in almost all samples (96.4%), A. gerencseriae, A. meyeri, catalase-negative A. naeslundii and catalase-positive A. naeslundii genospecies 2 were detected in < 50% samples. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the developed oligonucleotide probes, complementary to the variable regions of 16S rDNA, would be of potential value for differentiating Actinomyces spp. in clinical samples from the oral cavity and other ecosystems where such species may abound.
TI  - The antimicrobial efficacy of 'MGP' gutta-percha in vitro.
AB  - AIM: To determine whether 'MGP' gutta-percha (Westport, CT, USA), a commercially  available gutta-percha containing iodoform, inhibits the growth of potential endodontic pathogens. METHODOLOGY: Inocula of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus sanguis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces odontolyticus were spread onto the surface of agar plates. 'MGP' gutta-percha cones presoaked in sterile water were transferred to the inoculated agar and incubated at 37 degrees C aerobically or anaerobically as required for optimal growth. Identical studies were performed using iodoform-free gutta-percha and sterile paper disks saturated with 10% povidone-iodine. Following incubation, zones of inhibition around the 'MGP' gutta-percha, iodoform-free gutta-percha and disks were evaluated. RESULTS: Povidone-iodine inhibited all the strains. Iodoform-free gutta-percha inhibited S. sanguis and A. odontolyticus. 'MGP' gutta-percha inhibited S. aureus, S. sanguis, A. odontolyticus and F. nucleatum. Neither iodoform-free gutta-percha nor 'MGP' gutta-percha inhibited growth of E. faecalis, E. coli or P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to iodoform-free gutta-percha, iodoform-containing 'MGP' gutta-percha had an inhibitory effect in vitro on S. aureus and F. nucleatum, but not on E. faecalis, E. coli or P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Actinomyces spp. in supragingival plaque of ethnic Chinese preschool children with and without active dental caries.
AB  - Very limited molecular epidemiological data are available on the role of Actinomyces spp. in the pathogenesis of caries in the primary dentition. Therefore, we investigated their distribution in supragingival plaque of ethnic Chinese preschool children from Singapore and Hong Kong, either with or without active caries. Plaque samples were taken from intact interproximal enamel areas using dental floss. Bacterial genomic DNA of each sample was extracted and variable regions of 16S ribosomal DNA amplified and labelled with digoxigenin. Oligonucleotide probes specific for Actinomyces bovis, Actinomyces gerencseriae, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces meyeri, Actinomyces odontolyticus, catalase-negative Actinomyces naeslundii (genospecies 1 and 2) and catalase-positive Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (previously Actinomyces viscosus serotype II) were used to detect these species using Southern hybridization with a Minislot and Miniblotter system. A. odontolyticus, A. gerencseriae and A. meyeri were detected with similar frequency in both Singapore and Hong Kong samples or in those with and without active caries. However, the prevalence of A. naeslundii was significantly different in the two locales (p<0.05). A. odontolyticus (88.7%), A. gerencseriae (56.6%) and A. naeslundii (50.9%) were detected in a majority of the samples and the positive hybridization signals of A. gerencseriae in the caries-active group were stronger than from the caries-free group. A. bovis and A. israelii were undetectable in any of the samples. These data imply that A. odontolyticus, A. naeslundii and A. gerencseriae may play an important role in supragingival plaque formation on primary teeth in ethnic Chinese, with others such as A. meyeri contributing.
TI  - Lung abscess caused by Actinomyces odontolyticus.
AB  - A 64-year-old woman with periodontal disease was admitted because of fever, right chest pain, and bloody sputum. Her chest radiograph revealed a nodular shadow in the right middle lung fields. From the results of a needle aspiration biopsy, she was diagnosed with a lung abscess due to Actinomyces odontolyticus (A. odontolyticus) and Streptococcus spp. The patient improved quickly with antibiotics. To our knowledge, only nine cases of pulmonary infection due to A. odontolyticus have been reported, and we report the first case in Japan. Although respiratory disease caused by A. odontolyticus is rare, the association of this organism should be considered even in healthy individuals.
TI  - Oral Actinomyces isolates forming red colonies on brain heart blood agar can bee  unambiguously classified as A odontolyticus by macroscopic examination.
AB  - The accurate classification of oral Actinomyces isolates as one species is difficult. Out of 18 Actinomyces isolates forming red colonies on brain heart blood agar, 12 could be straightforwardly assigned as Actinomyces odontolyticus by biochemical, morphological, and chemotaxonomic characteristics. For the remaining six isolates, the results of the different identification methods were inconsistent. By sequencing a 16S ribosomal DNA fragment by a rapid mass spectrometric method, all isolates could be identified unambiguously as A. odontolyticus. This result proves the importance of red colony pigmentation on brain heart blood agar together with the characteristic cell morphology for unequivocal assignment of oral Actinomyces isolates to the species A. odontolyticus.
TI  - Calibrated latex microspheres percolation: a possible route to model endodontic bacterial leakage.
AB  - Endodontic therapy is conducted to effectively seal the root canal system. In vitro methods are used to estimate the quality of the seal, generally by measuring any microleakage that allows the tracers to penetrate along the obturated root canal. The use of bacteria as tracers seems to give the most clinically relevant demonstration of microleakage associated with a root canal system. Many bacterial strains have been used to evaluate marginal leakage, but results are sometimes contradictory, probably because they may depend on the bacterial strain used. In the studies described in this article, the percolation of both calibrated latex microspheres equivalent in diameter (0.4-9.5 microm) to bacteria and three bacterial strains (Actinomyces odontolyticus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Pseudomonas fluorescens) was compared in teeth filled using noncompressive and compressive techniques. The depth (d) to which the microspheres and bacteria penetrated varied over the time (t) of contamination according to a logarithmic relation. The slope (S) and the intercept (I, corresponding to penetration after 1 month) of the d = f(In t) plots can serve to quantify penetration over time. Statistical analysis of I by the Newman-Keuls procedure, which couples the tracers and filling techniques, showed that A. odontolyticus and L. acidophilus behave like 4.8-microm particles and P. fluorescens like 2.2-microm particles (corresponding approximately to their size in length) and that noncompressive techniques are less hermetic than compressive techniques. S and I are in direct relation and this relation is independent of the filling technique. Moreover, for the calibrated particles, both I and S varied linearly with the inverse of the square root of the particle diameter, indicating that their displacements are governed solely by Brownian movements and the penetration over time is caused by diffusion phenomena. The size of the tracer is the predominant factor governing its penetration. Inert particles mimic bacterial percolation into the marginal hiatus and can thus be used to model this percolation and establish a relative scale of the behavior of different bacteria during percolation.
TI  - Distribution of selected bacterial species on intraoral surfaces.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: To examine the proportions of 40 bacterial species in samples from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces and saliva in systemically healthy adult subjects and to compare these microbiotas with those of supra- and subgingival plaque. METHODS: Microbial samples were taken from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces of 225 systemically healthy subjects using a "buccal brush". Saliva was taken by expectoration. Forty-four of these subjects provided additional supra- and subgingival plaque samples. Samples were individually evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The percentage of total DNA probe count was determined for each species, at each sample location and averaged across subjects. The significance of differences among the proportions of the 40 test species at different sample locations was sought in the 225 and 44 subjects separately using the Quade test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. Cluster analysis was performed using the proportions of the 40 species at the different sample locations using the minimum similarity coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. The proportions of each species were averaged across subjects in the resulting cluster groups and the significance of differences was tested using the t-test and ANOVA. RESULTS: Microbial profiles differed markedly among sample locations in the 225 subjects, with 34 of 40 species differing significantly. Proportions of Veillonella parvula and Prevotella melaninogenica were higher in saliva and on the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the tongue, while Streptococcus mitis and S. oralis were in significantly lower proportions in saliva and on the tongue dorsum. Cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 2 clusters with >85% similarity. Cluster 1 comprised saliva, lateral and dorsal tongue surfaces, while Cluster 2 comprised the remaining soft tissue locations. V. parvula, P. melaninogenica, Eikenella corrodens, Neisseria mucosa, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Fusobacterium periodonticum, F. nucleatum ss vincentii and Porphyromonas gingivalis were in significantly higher proportions in Cluster 1 and S. mitis, S. oralis and S. noxia were significantly higher in Cluster 2. These findings were confirmed using data from the 44 subjects providing plaque samples. The microbial profiles of supra- and subgingival plaque differed from the other sample locations, particularly in the increased proportions of the Actinomyces species. Species of different genera exhibited different proportions on the various intraoral surfaces, but even within the genus Streptococcus, there were differences in colonization patterns. S. oralis, S. mitis and S. constellatus colonized the soft tissues and saliva in higher proportions than the samples from the teeth, while the other 4 streptococcal species examined colonized the dental surfaces in proportions comparable to the soft tissue locations and saliva. CONCLUSIONS: Proportions of bacterial species differed markedly on different intraoral surfaces. The microbiota of saliva was most similar to that of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue. The microbiotas of the soft tissues resembled each other more than the microbiotas that colonized the teeth both above and below the gingival margin.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of medicinal plant extracts against periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - This study was performed to evaluate the antibacterial activity of Althaea officinalis L. roots, Arnica montana L. flowers, Calendula officinalis L. flowers, Hamamelis virginiana L. leaves, Illicium verum Hook. fruits and Melissa officinalis L. leaves, against anaerobic and facultative aerobic periodontal bacteria: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Veilonella parvula, Eikenella corrodens, Peptostreptococcus micros and Actinomyces odontolyticus. The methanol extracts of H. virginiana and A. montana and, to a lesser extent, A. officinalis were shown to possess an inhibiting activity (MIC < or = 2048 mg/L) against many of the species tested. In comparison, M. officinalis and C. officinalis extracts had a lower inhibiting activity (MIC > or = 2048 mg/L) against all the tested species with the exception of Prevotella sp. Illicium verum methanol extract was not very active though it had a particular good activity against E. corrodens. The results suggest the use of the alcohol extracts of H. virginiana, A. montana and A. officinalis for topical medications in periodontal prophylactics.
TI  - Usefulness of the MicroSeq 500 16S ribosomal DNA-based bacterial identification system for identification of clinically significant bacterial isolates with ambiguous biochemical profiles.
AB  - Due to the inadequate automation in the amplification and sequencing procedures,  the use of 16S rRNA gene sequence-based methods in clinical microbiology laboratories is largely limited to identification of strains that are difficult to identify by phenotypic methods. In this study, using conventional full-sequence 16S rRNA gene sequencing as the "gold standard," we evaluated the usefulness of the MicroSeq 500 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA)-based bacterial identification system, which involves amplification and sequencing of the first 527-bp fragment of the 16S rRNA genes of bacterial strains and analysis of the sequences using the database of the system, for identification of clinically significant bacterial isolates with ambiguous biochemical profiles. Among 37 clinically significant bacterial strains that showed ambiguous biochemical profiles, representing 37 nonduplicating aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative, anaerobic, and Mycobacterium species, the MicroSeq 500 16S rDNA-based bacterial identification system was successful in identifying 30 (81.1%) of them. Five (13.5%) isolates were misidentified at the genus level (Granulicatella adiacens was misidentified as Abiotrophia defectiva, Helcococcus kunzii was misidentified as Clostridium hastiforme, Olsenella uli was misidentified as Atopobium rimae, Leptotrichia buccalis was misidentified as Fusobacterium mortiferum, and Bergeyella zoohelcum was misidentified as Rimerella anatipestifer), and two (5.4%) were misidentified at the species level (Actinomyces odontolyticus was misidentified as Actinomyces meyeri and Arcobacter cryaerophilus was misidentified as Arcobacter butzleri). When the same 527-bp DNA sequences of these seven isolates were compared to the known 16S rRNA gene sequences in the GenBank, five yielded the correct identity, with good discrimination between the best and second best match sequences, meaning that the reason for misidentification in these five isolates was due to a lack of the 16S rRNA gene sequences of these bacteria in the database of the MicroSeq 500 16S rDNA-based bacterial identification system. In conclusion, the MicroSeq 500 16S rDNA-based bacterial identification system is useful for identification of most clinically important bacterial strains with ambiguous biochemical profiles, but the database of the MicroSeq 500 16S rDNA-based bacterial identification system has to be expanded in order to encompass the rarely encountered bacterial species and achieve better accuracy in bacterial identification.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of self-etching primer-bonding systems.
AB  - Self-etching primers are now considered the new generation of dentin bonding systems that modify and incorporate the bacteria-containing smear layer into their bonding mechanism. The antibacterial effects of the self-etching primers Clearfil SE Bond, Mac Bond, Imperva FL Bond, One-Up BondF and Prompt L-Pop were evaluated using the bacteria Streptococcus mutans ATCC25175, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus catenaforme, Lactobacillus jensenii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Clostridium ramosum, Prevotella oris, Prevotella denticola and Fusobacterium nucleatum, with a disk diffusion method. A single-bottle total-etch dentin adhesive (Excite) was used for comparisons and chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as the positive control. After incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed. One-Up BondF, Prompt L-Pop and Excite showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. The bonding agents of Clearfil SE Bond, Mac Bond and Imperva FL Bond were unable to inhibit the growth of Lactobacillus jensenii and Actinomyces odontolyticus, while the primers of these systems produced inhibition halos to all tested microorganisms greater than that of chlorhexidine.
TI  - Genotypic diversity of clinical Actinomyces species: phenotype, source, and disease correlation among genospecies.
AB  - We determined the frequency distribution of Actinomyces spp. recovered in a routine clinical laboratory and investigated the clinical significance of accurate identification to the species level. We identified 92 clinical strains of Actinomyces, including 13 strains in the related Arcanobacterium-Actinobaculum taxon, by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and recorded their biotypes, sources, and disease associations. The clinical isolates clustered into 21 genogroups. Twelve genogroups (74 strains) correlated with a known species, and nine genogroups (17 strains) did not. The individual species had source and disease correlates. Actinomyces turicensis was the most frequently isolated species and was associated with genitourinary tract specimens, often with other organisms and rarely with inflammatory cells. Actinomyces radingae was most often associated with serious, chronic soft tissue abscesses of the breast, chest, and back. Actinomyces europaeus was associated with skin abscesses of the neck and genital areas. Actinomyces lingnae, Actinomyces gravenitzii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, and Actinomyces meyeri were isolated from respiratory specimens, while A. odontolyticus-like strains were isolated from diverse sources. Several of the species were commonly coisolated with a particular bacterium: Actinomyces israelii was the only Actinomyces spp. coisolated with Actinobacillus (Haemophilus) actinomycetemcomitans; Actinomyces meyeri was coisolated with Peptostreptococcus micros and was the only species other than A. israelii associated with sulfur granules in histological specimens. Most genogroups had consistent biotypes (as determined with the RapID ANA II system); however, strains were misidentified, and many codes were not in the database. One biotype was common to several genogroups, with all of these isolates being identified as A. meyeri. Despite the recent description of new Actinomyces spp., 19% of the isolates recovered in our routine laboratory belonged to novel genospecies. One novel group with three strains, Actinomyces houstonensis sp. nov., was phenotypically similar to A. meyeri and A. turicensis but was genotypically closest to Actinomyces neuii. A. houstonensis sp. nov. was associated with abscesses. Our data documented consistent site and disease associations for 21 genogroups of Actinomyces spp. that provide greater insights into appropriate treatments. However, we also demonstrated a complexity within the Actinomyces genus that compromises the biochemical identification of Actinomyces that can be performed in most clinical laboratories. It is our hope that this large group of well-defined strains will be used to find a simple and accurate biochemical test for differentiation of the species in routine laboratories.
TI  - Combinations of bacterial species in endodontic infections.
AB  - AIM: This study was undertaken to investigate combinations of bacteria found in root-canal infections of teeth with periapical bone destruction without clinical signs and symptoms. METHODOLOGY: Endodontic samples from 58 root canals were cultured anaerobically and microorganisms were counted and identified. Eighty-one combinations of microorganisms were found and tested for a symbiotic relationship using the Fisher's exact test and Odds ratio calculation. RESULTS: All samples contained microorganisms with a median CFU mL(-1) of 8x10(4) per sample. Strict anaerobic species accounted for 87% of the microflora. The most prevalent bacteria were Prevotella intermedia, Peptostreptococcus micros and Actinomyces odontolyticus, present in 33, 29 and 19%, respectively, of the cultured canals. A significant relationship (P<0.05) and an Odds ratio >2 were found between P. intermedia and P. micros, P. intermedia and P. oralis, A. odontolyticus and P. micros, Bifidobacterium spp. and Veillonella spp. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that endodontic pathogens do not occur at random but are found in specific combinations.
TI  - [Canaliculitis caused by Actinomyces in a case of dry eye with punctal plug occlusion].
AB  - BACKGROUND: We report a case of canaliculitis caused by Actinomyces odontolyticus in a case of dry eye with punctal plugs. CASE: A 64-year-old female with Sjogren's syndrome type of dry eye developed lacrimation, congestion in the lower palpebral conjunctiva and corneal epithelial damage in her right eye 30 months after punctal plug occlusion. After removal of the plug from lower punctum in her right eye, white material exuded from the punctum. However, even after the removal of a plug, corneal epithelial keratopathy did not get worse, implying that the granulation tissue formed by the plug completely occluded the canaliculus. Actinomices odontolyticus was cultured from the white material. One week after topical antibiotic treatment, conjunctival congestion and irritation were resolved. CONCLUSION: This report indicates the possibility of canaliculitis as a complication of punctal plug occlusion. Careful observation is necessary after punctal occlusion with punctal plugs.
TI  - Diagnosis of pelvic actinomycosis by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and its clinical significance.
AB  - Traditional ways of identification of anaerobic Gram-positive non-sporulating bacilli by isolation of the organism and studying it phenotypically by elucidation of its morphologic and biochemical characteristics and metabolic end products are associated with a need for special equipment and expertise, and strains that are "unidentified" because of ambiguous biochemical profiles. In this study, an anaerobic Gram-positive non-sporulating bacterium was isolated from the intrauterine contraceptive device of a 36-year old woman with pyosalpinx. The Vitek system (ANI) showed that it was 99% Propionibacterium granulosum; whereas the API system (20A) showed that it was 78% Actinomyces meyeri/odontolyticus. The 16S ribosomal RNA gene of the strain was amplified and sequenced. There was 0 base difference between the isolate and A. odontolyticus (GenBank Accession no. AJ234047), indicating the isolate most closely resembled a strain of A. odontolyticus. Identification of the organism in this study was important because the duration of antibiotic therapy would be entirely different. In the present case, identification of the bacterium as A. odontolyticus inferred that the patient suffered from an intermediate form of pelvic actinomycosis. A prolonged course of antibiotics would be more desirable, as the relapse rate of actinomycosis after a short course of antibiotics is high.
TI  - The effects of an immediately pre-surgical chlorhexidine oral rinse on the bacterial contaminants of bone debris collected during dental implant surgery.
AB  - Dental implant surgery produces bone debris that can be used in the "simultaneous augmentation" technique. Although this debris is contaminated with oral bacteria, a stringent aspiration protocol has been shown to reduce the levels of contamination. Chlorhexidine mouthrinse is a well-proven antibacterial rinse that has been shown to reduce infectious complications associated with dental implants. This study examined the effect of pre-operative rinsing with a 0.1% chlorhexidine digluconate mouthrinse on the bacterial contaminants present in collected bone debris bone (CBD). Twenty partially edentate patients were randomly allocated into equal groups and underwent bone collection using the Frios Bone Collector (FBC) during the insertion of two dental implants. In group T a pre-operative chlorhexidine rinse was used, whilst in group C sterile water was used. For both groups, a stringent bone collection protocol was used. Bone samples were immediately transported for microbial analysis. Colonial and microscopic morphology, gaseous requirements and identification kits were utilised for identification of the isolated microbes. Thirty-nine species were identified including a number associated with disease, in particular Actinomyces odontolyticus, Clostridium bifermentans, Prevotella intermedia, and Propionibacterium propionicum. Samples from group T (chlorhexidine mouthrinse) yielded significantly fewer organisms (P < 0.001) than in group C (sterile water mouthrinse). Gram-positive cocci dominated the isolates from both groups. It is concluded that if bone debris is to be used for the purpose of immediate simultaneous augmentation, a preoperative chlorhexidine mouthrinse should be utilised in conjunction with a stringent aspiration protocol to reduce further the bacterial contamination of CBD.
TI  - Effects of instrumentation, irrigation and dressing with calcium hydroxide on infection in pulpless teeth with periapical bone lesions.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the fate of microorganisms in root canals of teeth with infected pulps and periapical bone lesions with and without the use of calcium hydroxide medication. METHODOLOGY: Endodontic samples were cultured and microorganisms were counted and identified in 43 teeth before (sample 1) and after (sample 2) treatment during the first visit and before (sample 3) and after (sample 4) treatment during the second visit. In the first visit teeth were instrumented and half of the teeth were filled with a thick slurry of calcium hydroxide in sterile saline. The other teeth were obturated with gutta-percha and AH-2 6 sealer. After 4 weeks the teeth with calcium-hydroxide were accessed again and after microbiological sampling they were obturated with gutta-percha and AH-26 sealer. RESULTS: The mean total colony forming unit (CFU) counts of positive samples dropped significantly as a result of canal preparation during the first visit from 1.0 x 10(6) to 1.8 x 10(3) (between samples 1 and 2) but increased to 9.3 x 10(3) in the period between the two visits (sample 2 and 3). There was no difference in mean total CFU counts of positive samples between the end of the first (sample 2) and the end of the second visit (sample 4). The most frequently isolated species were Prevotella intermedia, Capnocytophaga spp.. Actinomyces odontolyticus. Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus micros. CONCLUSIONS: Although a calcium hydroxide paste was placed in the prepared canals, the number of positive canals had increased in the period between visits. However, the number of microorganisms had only increased to 0.93% of the original number of CFU (sample 1). It is concluded that a calcium hydroxide and sterile saline slurry limits but does not totally prevent regrowth of endodontic bacteria.
TI  - The predominant microflora of nursing caries lesions.
AB  - The predominant microflora recovered from infected dentine of 52 carious teeth from 14 children with nursing caries was determined using both selective and non-selective media for the isolation of specific genera and acidified media (pH 5.2) to isolate the predominant aciduric microorganisms, and compared with the microflora of sound enamel surfaces in caries-free children. Streptococcus mutans formed a significantly greater proportion of the lesion flora while Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus gordonii formed a significantly greater proportion of the plaque flora from sound tooth surfaces. The proportions of Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces odontolyticus were significantly greater in the plaque samples than in the lesion samples. Actinomyces israelii formed 18.2% of the flora from the lesions, but was not isolated from the plaque samples. The proportions of Candida albicans, Lactobacillus spp. and Veillonella spp. were also significantly greater in the carious dentine than in the plaque samples. The most frequently isolated lactobacilli were Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The predominant aciduric flora was S. oralis, S. mutans and A. israelii and these taxa were also isolated from a similar proportion of the lesions at pH 7.0. Strains of S. mutans, L. casei, L. fermentum and L. rhamnosus isolated from individual carious teeth were genotyped using PCR-based methods. Each species was genotypically heterogeneous and different genotypes were recovered from different carious teeth in the same child. These data indicate that the microflora of lesions in the same child is microbiologically diverse and support a non-specific aetiology for nursing caries in which the physiological characteristics of the infecting flora, not its composition, is the major determinant underlying the disease process.
TI  - Actinomyces suimastitidis sp. nov., isolated from pig mastitis.
AB  - An unusual Actinomyces-like bacterium originating from a pig with mastitis was subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic investigation. The morphological and biochemical characteristics of the organism were consistent with its preliminary assignment to the genus Actinomyces but it did not appear to correspond to any recognized species. PAGE analysis of whole-cell proteins confirmed the phenotypic distinctiveness of the bacterium and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis demonstrated that it represents a hitherto unknown sub-line amongst a cluster of Actinomyces species which embraces Actinomyces canis, Actinomyces georgiae, Actinomyces hyovaginalis, Actinomyces meyeri, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Actinomyces radingae and Actinomyces turicensis. Based on phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence, it is proposed that the unknown bacterium isolated from pig mastitis be classified as Actinomyces suimastitidis sp. nov. The type strain of Actinomyces suimastitidis is CCUG 39279T (= CIP 106779T).
TI  - Antibacterial activity and post-antibiotic effect of flurithromycin compared with other macrolides and penicillins against periodontal pathogens.
AB  - In this study the authors examined the activity of flurithromycin compared to that of erythromycin, spiramycin and penicillin against 107 strains of various species supposed to cause periodontitis. The range of MICs of flurithromycin was: < or =0.06-2 mg/l for P. gingivalis (28 isolates), 0.06-2 mg/l for P. melaninogenica (7), 0.5-4 mg/l for P. intermedia (5), 0.25-8 mg/l for Prevotella sp. (8), 1-16 mg/l for F. nucleatum (14), 0.12-0.5 mg/l for W. recta (2), 0.5-32 mg/l for E. corrodens, 0.5-2 mg/l for B. forsythus (2); < or =0.06-64 mg/l for Peptostreptococcus sp. (11), < or =0.06-1 mg/l for A. odontolyticus (11) and for A. naeslundii (7) and < or =0.06-16 mg/l for A. viscosus (7). Macrolide activity was ranked in decreasing order from flurithromycin to erythromycin to spiramycin. Beta-lactamase production was demonstrated in Prevotella sp. (20%) and in F. nucleatum (7%). Isolates which were beta-lactamase negative but resistant to penicillin were found among Peptostreptococcus sp. and Actinomyces sp. A post-antibiotic effect of 2 hours was seen for flurithromycin on P. gingivalis and E. corrodens. The good in vitro activity of flurithromycin against bacteria supposed to cause periodontitis suggests clinical potential in the treatment of these diseases.
TI  - Microbial analysis of bone collected during implant surgery: a clinical and laboratory study.
AB  - Dental implant surgery produces bone debris which can be used to correct bone defects in the "simultaneous-augmentation" technique. However, this debris is potentially contaminated with oral bacteria. Therefore, this study examined bone debris collected during dental implant surgery in order 1) to identify the microbial contaminants and 2) to compare the effects of two different aspiration protocols on the levels of microbial contamination. Twenty-four partially dentate patients were randomly allocated into two equal groups and underwent bone collection using the Frios Bone Collector during surgery to insert two endosseous dental implants. In group S (using a stringent aspiration protocol), bone collection occurred within the surgical site only. In group NS (utilizing a non-stringent aspiration protocol), bone collection and tissue fluid control was achieved using the same suction tip. Bone samples were immediately transported for microbial analysis. Colonial and microscopic morphology, gaseous requirements and identification kits were utilized for identification of the isolated microbes. Twenty-eight species were identified including a number associated with disease, in particular, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis as well as the anaerobes Actinomyces odontolyticus, Eubacterium sp., Prevotella intermedia, Propionibacterium propionicum and Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. In group S (stringent aspiration protocol), significantly fewer organisms were found than in group NS, the non-stringent aspiration protocol (P=0.001). Gram-positive cocci dominated the isolates from both groups. It is concluded that if bone debris is collected for implantation around dental implants, it should be collected with a stringent aspiration protocol (within the surgical site only) to minimize bacterial contaminants.
TI  - Red light kills bacteria via photodynamic action.
AB  - With the increase in the number of antibiotic resistant strains of microorganism, the search for alternative treatments of microbial infections becomes all the more important. We report a novel method for bacterial inactivation based on the optical excitation of the naturally occurring (endogenous) photosensitzing porphyrins by red light. In particular, the pathogenic Gram-positive porphyrin producing ATCC strains Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces odontolyticus and Porphyromonas gingivalis were investigated. Sensitive autofluorescence spectroscopy revealed that these bacteria naturally synthezise the fluorescent photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX. In addition, bacterial plaque samples of periodontitis patients were studied. Non-labeled fluorescent bacterial colonies were exposed to red light at 632.8 nm, 100 mW/cm2 light intensity and 360 J/cm2 energy density using a helium-neon laser. The survival rate after a single phototreatment with red light was found to be 0.58 +/- 0.09 in the case of Propionibacterium acnes, 0.30 +/- 0.04 in Actinomyces odontolyticus and 0.59 +/- 0.10 in Porphyrormonas gingivalis compared to non-exposed bacteria suspensions. No photoeffect was found for the bacterium Streptococcus mutans which exhibited no detectable porphyrin autofluorescence. Red-light exposed plaque samples of patients showed significant reduction of colony forming units by 50% as well as a pronounced photoeffect on the pigmented species Prevotella intermedia. Taken together, these results suggest the treatment with red light can be potentially employed as an therapeutic method to inactivate certain pathogenic strains of porphyrin producing bacteria without the use of external photosensitizers.
TI  - Microbial composition of supra- and subgingival plaque in subjects with adult periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND, AIMS: The purpose of the present study was to compare and relate the  microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51 +/- 14 years). METHODS: A total of 1,170 samples of supra and subgingival plaque were collected from the mesial aspect of every tooth (up to 28 supra and 28 subgingival samples) from each subject and evaluated for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level, were made at 6 sites per tooth. The counts (levels), % DNA probe count (proportion) and % of sites colonized (prevalence) of each species in supra and separately in subgingival plaque were computed for each subject. Significance of differences between supra and subgingival plaque for each species was sought using the Wilcoxon signed ranks test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: All 40 taxa were detected in both supra and subgingival plaque. Actinomyces species were the most prevalent taxa in both habitats. 75 to 100% of supra and 62 to 100% of subgingival sites were colonized by at least one of the 5 Actinomyces species. Supragingival samples exhibited significantly higher counts of Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Neisseria mucosa, Streptococcus gordonii, Capnocytophaga ochracea and Capnocytophaga sputigena when compared with mean counts in subgingival samples taken from the same tooth surfaces. Subgingival plaque samples presented significantly higher counts of Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Bacteroides forsythus and Porphykromonas gingivalis. Subgingival samples exhibited a significantly higher proportion of "red" and "orange complex" species, while supragingival plaque exhibited higher proportions of "green" and "purple" complex species as well as Actinomyces species. Suspected periodontal pathogens could be detected in supragingival plaque from sites where subgingival samples were negative for the same species. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that supragingival plaque can harbor putative periodontal pathogens, suggesting a possible role of this environment as a reservoir of such species for the spread or reinfection of subgingival sites.
TI  - Actinomyces canis sp. nov., isolated from dogs.
AB  - Three strains of a previously undescribed catalase-positive Actinomyces-like bacterium were isolated from dogs. Biochemical testing and PAGE analysis of whole-cell proteins indicated that the strains were phenotypically highly related to each other but different from previously described Actinomyces and Arcanobacterium species. Sequencing of 16S rRNA showed that the unknown bacterium represents a new subline within a cluster of species which includes Actinomyces hyovaginalis, Actinomyces georgiae, Actinomyces meyeri, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Actinomyces radingae and Actinomyces turicensis. On the basis of phenotypic evidence and 16S rRNA sequence divergence levels (greater than 5% with recognized Actinomyces species) it is proposed that the unknown strains from canine sources be classified as a new species with the name Actinomyces canis sp. nov. The type strain of Actinomyces canis is CCUG 41706T (= CIP 106351T).
TI  - Actinomycotic ulcer of the oral mucosa: an unusual presentation of oral actinomycosis.
AB  - Although the oral mucosa is often the site of entry of actinomyces into the deeper tissues, actinomycosis in the oral mucosa is extremely rare. Actinomycotic lesions are usually described as either single or multiple abscesses or indurated masses with hard fibrous walls and soft central loculations. Actinomyces israelii is the principal cause of human actinomycosis. We present a rare case of actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces odontolyticus; it presented primarily as a long-standing ulcer of the oral mucosa mimicking a squamous cell carcinoma.
TI  - Oral colonization with Actinomyces species in infants by two years of age.
AB  - In early childhood, the human mouth is already colonized by actinomycetes. Due to recent taxonomic changes within the genus Actinomyces, up-to-date data are warranted on the time and succession of different Actinomyces species in the oral cavity. By using a longitudinal study design and culture techniques, we examined the age-related occurrence of Actinomyces species in saliva from 39 healthy infants at 2, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of age. Altogether 428 Actinomyces isolates were available for this study. Identification was based on biochemical tests and gas chromatographic demonstration of metabolic end-products, and when needed, cellular fatty acid profiles were determined. The frequency of the total actinomycetal flora increased from 31% to 97% within 2 years. A. odontolyticus was the most prominent Actinomyces colonizer at all five sampling occasions. A. naeslundii was the second most common Actinomyces sp. but was not detected before the age of 1 year. As a novel observation, we found A. graevenitzii in the oral cavity. The number of A. graevenitzii isolates indicates that this species is not just occasionally present in infants' mouths. We also found A. viscosus, A. gerencseriae, A. israelii, and A. georgiae. Based on the present results, we suggest that A. odontolyticus is the main primary Actinomyces species on oral mucosal surfaces in infants up to 2 years of age.
TI  - The effect of scaling and root planing on the clinical and microbiological parameters of periodontal diseases: 12-month results.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Previously, we reported that SRP resulted in a decrease in mean  pocket depth and attachment level and reduced prevalence and levels of Bacteroidesforsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Treponema denticola at 3 and 6 months post-SRP in 57 subjects with adult periodontitis. 32 of the 57 subjects were monitored at 9 and 12 months. Thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the microbial and clinical effects of SRP in 32 (mean age 48+/-11) subjects over a 12-month period. METHOD: Clinical assessments of plaque, gingival redness, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth and attachment level were made prior to SRP and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-therapy. Subgingival plaque samples were taken at each visit and analyzed using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique for the presence and levels of 40 subgingival species. Each subject also received maintenance scaling at each of the subsequent monitoring visits. Differences in clinical parameters and prevalence and levels of bacterial species were analyzed pre- and post-therapy using the Wilcoxon signed ranks test. The Quade test for related samples was used for analysis of multiple visits. RESULTS: Mean pocket depth (mm+/-SEM) decreased from 3.2+/-0.3 at baseline to 2.9+/-0.3 at 12 months (p<0.01). Mean attachment level showed significant reduction at 6 months, but did not diminish further. Bleeding on probing and plaque were significantly reduced at 12 months (p<0.001, p<0.05, respectively). P. gingivalis, B. forsythus and T. denticola decreased in prevalence and levels up to the 6-month visit and remained at these lower levels at 9 and 12 months. Significant increases in levels and prevalence were noted at 12 months for Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Fusobacterium nucleatum ss polymorphum, Streptococcus mitis, Capnocytophaga sp, and Veillonella parvula. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the maintenance phase of therapy may be essential in consolidating clinical and microbiological improvements achieved as a result of initial therapy.
TI  - Identification of oral Actinomyces species using DNA probes.
AB  - Oral Actinomyces comprise a major segment of both the supra- and subgingival microbiota; however, little is known about the distribution of individual species in different sites or clinical conditions. The purpose of the present investigation was to develop DNA probes for suggested species and genotypes of oral Actinomyces. Whole genomic DNA probes to 12 human oral species and/or serotypes were labeled with digoxigenin and used to seek cross-reactions among the taxa using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization assay. The Actinomyces formed three distinct groups: 1) Actinomyces georgiae, Actinomyces meyeri and Actinomyces odontolyticus serotypes I and II; 2) Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces naeslundii serotypes I, II, III and WVA 963; and 3) Actinomyces gerencseriae and Actinomyces israelii. Cross-reactions among taxa were detected and minimized by increasing the temperature of the post-hybridization high-stringency wash to 80 degrees C. Despite the elevation in high stringency wash temperature, cross-reactions among strains of the A. naeslundii/A. viscosus group persisted. Probes for two of the three currently recognized genospecies in this group were prepared by removing the DNA in common between cross-reacting species using subtraction hybridization and polymerase chain reaction. Nine species and genospecies could be clearly separated by a combination of whole genomic and subtraction hybridization probes and by increasing the high-stringency wash temperature. A total of 195 fresh isolates of Actinomyces were grouped in a blind study using DNA probes and separately by SDS-PAGE protein profiles. Concordance between the two methods was 97.3%. The probes and hybridization conditions were tested for their ability to detect the Actinomyces species and genospecies in samples of supragingival and subgingival plaque from periodontitis subjects using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The probes detected the species in samples of supragingival and subgingival plaque. We concluded that whole genomic and subtraction hybridization DNA probes facilitate the detection and enumeration of species and genospecies of Actinomyces in plaque samples.
TI  - Activities of telithromycin (HMR 3647, RU 66647) compared to those of erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, and other antimicrobial agents against unusual anaerobes.
AB  - The comparative activity of telithromycin (HMR 3647) against 419 human anaerobic  isolates was determined by the agar dilution method. At concentrations of </=0.5 microgram/ml, telithromycin was active against Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Bacteroides tectum, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Bacteroides gracilis (now Campylobacter gracilis), Porphyromonas spp. (including Porphyromonas gingivalis and Porphyromonas macacae), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella heparinolytica, and almost all Peptostreptococcus species. Clostridia showed species and strain variability, often with a biphasic pattern. Fusobacterium species, except Fusobacterium russii, were relatively resistant.
TI  - Activities of gemifloxacin (SB 265805, LB20304) compared to those of other oral antimicrobial agents against unusual anaerobes.
AB  - The activities of gemifloxacin (SB 265805, LB20304) and comparator agents were determined by an agar dilution method against 419 clinical strains of less-commonly identified species of anaerobes. Gemifloxacin was generally more active than trovafloxacin against gram-positive strains by one to two dilutions. Peptostreptococci (Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Peptostreptococcus magnus, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Peptostreptococcus prevotii) and Porphyromonas spp. (Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Porphyromonas canoris, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Porphyromonas macacae) were all susceptible to </=0.25 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml. The MICs of gemifloxacin at which 90% of the following strains were inhibited (MIC(90)s) were </=2 microgram/ml: Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Clostridium innocuum, Clostridium clostridioforme, Anaerobiospirillum spp., Bacteroides tectum, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Bacteroides gracilis (now Campylobacter gracilis), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella heparinolytica, and the Prevotella oris-buccae group. Fusobacterium naviforme and Fusobacterium necrophorum were also susceptible to </=2 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml, while Fusobacterium varium strains exhibited a bimodal pattern; the other Fusobacterium species, such as Fusobacterium ulcerans and Fusobacterium russii, as well as Veillonella spp., the Prevotella melaninogenica group, Prevotella bivia, Clostridium difficile, and Bilophila wadsworthia were relatively resistant to gemifloxacin (MIC(90)s, >/=4 microgram/ml).
TI  - An evaluation of the action of different root canal irrigants on facultative aerobic-anaerobic, obligate anaerobic, and microaerophilic bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to test the effect of different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, and cetrimide on the following bacterial strains: Facultative aerobes-anaerobes: Candida albicans ATCC 10231; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212; Escherichia coli ATCC 25,922; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27,853; Streptococcus mitis ATCC 9811; Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35668; Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419; and Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556. Microaerophiles: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 29522. Obligate anaerobes: Actinomyces odontolyticus ATCC 17929; Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25,586; Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277; and Prevotella melaninogenica ATCC 25845. Each irrigant was kept in contact with the bacterial species used for the experiment for 10, 20, or 30 min. Results showed that all irrigants had a bactericidal effect on both facultative aerobes-anaerobes and on microaerophilic and obligate anaerobic strains, in all concentrations and even after short periods of contact.
TI  - beta-Hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms in apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis.
AB  - Thirteen teeth with necrotic pulps and apical periodontitis and nine severe periodontal pockets were cultured for presence of beta-hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms. Samples were dispersed and plated on two non-selective and one selective growth media and incubated anaerobically and in 10% CO2 in air. A total of 59 beta-hemolytic colonies were purified and identified. Eight beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates were obtained from three of the severe marginal periodontitis sites. All were identified as belonging to the Streptococcus sanguis group. No beta-hemolytic streptococci were detected in apical periodontitis samples. Twenty obligately anaerobic isolates were detected, all of which were known periodontal and endodontic pathogens. Isolates from apical periodontitis sites were identified as Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actionomyces odontolyticus and Peptostreptococcus micros, while severe marginal periodontal sites contained the same species with the addition of Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces meyeri. Of 19 staphylococci and micrococci, Staphylococcus epidermidis was the predominant isolate in both apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis sites. However, less commonly known organisms such as Staphylococcus cohnii and Micrococcus sp. were identified in severe marginal periodontitis sites. The isolation of Bacillus sp. (12 isolates) in one severe marginal periodontitis and two apical periodontitis subjects was especially interesting, warranting consideration of this organism as a legitimate isolate and potential pathogen in oral disease.
TI  - The predominant Actinomyces spp. isolated from infected dentin of active root caries lesions.
AB  - Actinomyces are Gram-positive pleomorphic rods (GPPR) which form a large proportion of the oral microflora of all mammals. They have been implicated in root caries, although their role in dental caries initiation and progression is not well-understood. Many studies have focused on Actinomyces naeslundii, but few reports have documented other members of the GPPR. Therefore, we investigated the GPPRs isolated from infected dentin of active root caries lesions (n = 9) to determine which species were the most frequently isolated. The GPPR were isolated under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions and identified by biochemical and physiological tests to the species level according to the new taxonomy. Of 654 GPPR isolates investigated, 607 were identified as belonging to the genus Actinomyces. Of these, 242 were identified as A. israelii, 225 as A. gerencseriae, 109 as A. naeslundii, 15 as A. odontolyticus, and 13 as A. georgiae. Individual strains of A. israelii (n = 56) and A. gerencseriae (n = 46) were also investigated at the DNA level by means of Repetitive Extragenic Palindromic polymerase chain-reactions (REP-PCR) for the study of clonal diversity. Although only a small number of isolates was investigated, REP-PCR showed that the genotypes of both A. gerencseriae and A. israelii populations were heterogeneous within individual root caries lesions. A. gerencseriae and A. israelii strains from the same lesions did not share the same REP-PCR patterns, showing the robustness of the identification scheme. A significantly greater proportion of A. gerencseriae was isolated from the aerobic plates (p < 0.05), while the proportion of A. israelii was significantly (p < 0.05) greater from anaerobic plates. The role of individual Actinomyces spp. in the root caries process remains unclear, since various populations of GPPRs were isolated from individual active root caries lesions.
TI  - The effect of oral decontamination with clindamycin palmitate on the incidence of bacteremia after esophageal dilation: a prospective trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent bacterial endocarditis is recommended in high-risk patients undergoing esophageal dilation, a high-risk procedure. Some studies suggest that the oropharynx is the source of bacteremia. A topical antibiotic mouthwash, which reduces bacterial colonization of the oral flora, might decrease bacteremia rates and would be an attractive alternative to systemic administration of antibiotics. METHODS: Adults undergoing outpatient bougienage for a benign or malignant esophageal stricture were randomized in a clinician-blinded fashion to either pre-procedure clindamycin mouthwash or no treatment. Subjects were stratified by type of dilator used. Blood cultures were obtained immediately after the first esophageal dilation and 5 minutes after the last dilation. RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients were enrolled: 30 in the treatment arm and 29 in the no-treatment arm. There were 7 positive blood cultures: 5 in the treatment arm and 2 in the no-treatment arm. The identified organisms were Streptococcus viridans (2), Staphylococcus mucilaginous (2), Lactobacillus (2), and Actinomyces odontolyticus (1). Patients with bacteremia reported greater subjective difficulty with dysphagia (p = 0.01) irrespective of stricture diameter, procurement of biopsies, or dilator type. CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of cases with bacteremia for all dilations performed in this manner was 12% (95% CI [5.3, 23.6]), much lower than previously cited. All organisms in this study were oral commensals. There appears to be no effect of a clindamycin mouthwash on reducing bacteremia after esophageal dilation.

TI  - Secretory immunoglobulin A heavy chain presents Galbeta1-3GalNAc binding structures for Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1.
AB  - Adherence of Actinomyces naeslundii ATCC 12104 to hydroxyapatite beads coated with protein fractions of parotid saliva, obtained by gel filtration on S-200 HR columns, showed GalNAcbeta1-3Galalpha-O-ethyl-inhibitable binding to high-molecular-weight proteins (Stromberg et al., 1992). The present study investigates the nature of these high-molecular-weight binding proteins and determines their specific ability to mediate adherence to representative strains of Actinomyces species. Strain ATCC 12104 bound specifically in a lactose-inhibitable manner to the heavy chain of secretory immunoglobulin A (S-IgA), contained within a high-molecular-weight parotid protein fraction separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to a solid membrane support. Lactose-inhibitable binding to the heavy chain of S-IgA from human colostrum was also demonstrated. Peanut agglutinin bound to the heavy chain of parotid and colostrum S-IgAs contained on solid support membranes, confirming the presence of Galbeta1-3GalNAc residues on these molecules. Both salivary and colostrum S-IgA aggregated with strain ATCC 12104 in a GalNAcbeta1-3Galalpha-O-ethyl-inhibitable fashion. Further separation of high-molecular-weight salivary proteins on S-500 HR columns showed GalNAcbeta1-3Galalpha-O-ethyl-inhibitable binding to both mucin- and S-IgA-containing fractions. The presence of S-IgA in salivary pellicles formed in vivo on teeth was demonstrated by Western blot analysis of pellicle extracts with anti-IgA antibodies. Among strains representing A. naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2 and A. odontolyticus, only those of genospecies 1 with a particular adherence profile showed efficient GalNAcbeta1-3Galalpha-O-ethyl-inhibitable binding to S-IgA. Thus, oligosaccharides on S-IgA may promote bacterial aggregation (or adherence) and provide a mechanism by which S-IgA can interact with bacteria without prior immunological challenge.
TI  - An evaluation of the CO2 laser for endodontic disinfection.
AB  - The goal of this study was to evaluate the bactericidal action of the CO2 laser on animal teeth infected with an endodontic bacterial species. After instrumentation, 24 freshly extracted incisors were inoculated with a known concentration of Actinomyces odontolyticus and incubated anaerobically for 18 h. The incisors were separated into three groups: group 1--untreated control teeth; group 2--teeth treated with 3% NaOCl; and group 3--teeth lased with a CO2 laser at 5 W using three successive 9.9 s irradiation periods with 10 s between treatments. For each of the three groups, 60 microliters samples were removed using gel loading capillary pipette tips, and the diluted samples were plated in triplicate on Columbia agar plates. After a 5- to 6-day incubation, the colony-forming units were counted, and the quantitative results were subjected to an analysis of variance. The results of this analysis indicated an average 85% decrease in the colony-forming units in the laser-treated group, compared with the control group. According to Fisher and Scheffe tests, the differences in the averages between the control and laser groups were statistically significant (p < 0.05). The NaOCl treatment was statistically superior to the CO2 laser treatment.
TI  - Ribotype diversity of Actinomyces with similar intraoral tropism but different types of N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine binding specificity.
AB  - Sixty-three isolates of Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2 and Actinomyces odontolyticus from three subjects clustered into 22 ribotypes. Unique ribotypes were found in the subjects and within individual tissue sites (bucca, tooth and tongue). A odontolyticus ribotypes shared tongue-specific binding properties, while those of genospecies 1 and 2 from buccal and tooth surfaces shared different types of N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine binding specificity.
TI  - Prevalence of nim genes in anaerobic/facultative anaerobic bacteria isolated in South Africa.
AB  - This study investigated the prevalence of nim genes (proposed to encode a 5-nitroimidazole resistance product) in 64 anaerobic/facultative anaerobic bacteria. Employing universal nim gene primers, 458-bp amplified fragments were recorded as presumptive positives in 22/64 strains at an annealing temperature of 52 degrees C and 15/64 strains at 62 degrees C, of which seven were propionibacteria. DNA sequencing confirmed the presence of nimA genes in Propionibacterium spp. (five strains), Actinomyces odontolyticus (one strain), Prevotella bivia (one strain) and Clostridium bifermentans (one strain) and nimB genes from five strains of Bacteroides fragilis. nimA genes were predominant in propionibacteria indicating a potential nimA gene source in anaerobic environments.
TI  - Dominant cross-reactive antibodies generated during the response to a variety of  oral bacterial species detect phosphorylcholine.
AB  - The intraperitoneal immunization of Balb/c mice with subgingival plaque from advanced periodontal pockets or with certain strains of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus mitis, or Streptococcus oralis yielded frequently indistinguishable IgM monoclonal antibodies which were reactive with antigens from a variety of oral bacteria. This study aimed to characterize the specificity of such monoclonal antibodies and the diversity of oral bacteria expressing this target antigen or epitope. Using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to study a variety of competitor substances for their capacity to bind to the monoclonal antibodies, we identified phosphorylcholine as the recognized epitope. The concentration of positive bacteria with extraordinarily bright cell wall fluorescence in indirect immunofluorescence assays varied between 0.1% and 15% in subgingival and from 10 to 40% in supragingival plaque samples. Labeled bacteria belonged to different morphotypes, including cocci, rods, and filaments. Of 75 species tested in vitro, 14 gram-positive and four gram-negative species were found to harbor positive strains. Haemophilus aphrophilus, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces georgiae, Actinomyces gerencseriae, Actinomyces israelii, and Actinomyces odontolyticus were human oral species of which all tested strains were capable of binding the cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies. In contrast, Actinomyces naeslundii was consistently negative. These data provide evidence for a much more common expression of phosphorylcholine by oral bacteria than hitherto believed but do not indicate an obvious association of phosphorylcholine expression with oral health or inflammatory periodontal diseases.
TI  - Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2 express different binding specificities to N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine, whereas Actinomyces odontolyticus expresses a different binding specificity in colonizing the human mouth.
AB  - A total of 102 strains of Actinomyces were isolated from teeth, buccal mucosa and tongue in eight individuals. The isolates were characterized by multivariate statistical analyses of phenotypic characteristics, serotyping and binding to beta-linked galactosamine (N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine) and acidic proline-rich protein structures. Based on these characteristics, isolates were classified into three major groups: (i) Isolates of Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 were the dominant species on teeth and buccal mucosa and bound commonly to N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine (63 of 63 isolates) and acidic proline-rich proteins (63 of 63 isolates), regardless of tissue origin. They all exhibited a N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine binding specificity signified by N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine-inhibitable coaggregation with the streptococcal strains LVG1, GVE1, 24892 and MPB1; (ii) Isolates of A. naeslundii genospecies 1 were prevalent on teeth in certain individuals and bound commonly to N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine (20 of 20 isolates), but less commonly to acidic proline-rich proteins (5 of 20 isolates). They all possessed another N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine specificity, i.e. N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine-inhibitable coaggregation with the same streptococcal strains except for strain MPB1; (iii) Isolates of Actinomyces odontolyticus, the dominant species on the tongue (17 of 19 isolates), bound commonly to unknown structures on streptococci (17 of 19 isolates) but rarely to N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine (2 of 19 isolates) or acidic proline-rich proteins (3 of 19 isolates). In conclusion, A. naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2 exhibit different patterns of N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine and acidic proline-rich protein specificities to colonize dental and buccal mucosa surfaces, whereas A. odontolyticus utilizes another specificity to colonize the tongue.
TI  - Oral microbiota and implant type membranes.
AB  - Candida albicans (Ca), Staphylococcus aureus (Sa), Streptococcus sanguis (Ss), Actinomyces naeslundii (An), Actinomyces odontolyticus (Ao), Porphyromona spp (P spp), Candida glabrata (Cg), Candida krusei (Ck), and Rhodotorula spp (R spp) were tested with equal pieces of biodegradable membranes. Membranes pretreated with saliva or clorhexidine and nontreated control membranes were tested in three different culture media containing 0.1 mL homologous suspension for each strain under study. Incubation was performed at 37 degrees C for 48 hours for aerobiosis and for five days for anaerobiosis. Macroscopy and microscopy were carried out. Membranes were removed, washed, and resuspended. Samples were sonicated, and the supernatant was disseminated on brain heart infusion broth or blood agar. Incubation was repeated, colony-forming unit counts were performed, and statistical analysis was carried out using analysis of variance transforming results to Log10 (x + 1), the highest interaction level was used to calculate standard error. Orthogonal contrast was used to compare the different microorganisms under study. Highest adhesion was found with Ca, Cg, Ck, Sa, and Ss. A sufficient quantity of Actinomyces could not be recovered from the membranes. Results with P spp were poor, confirming lower gram-negative adhesion. Replicate flasks with Ss and Ca were cultivated. Membranes were removed after washing and subjected to scanning electron microscopy, as were untreated control pieces. A cavelike surface was observed. Streptococcus sanguis adhering to the membranes showed extracellular projections. Candida and gram-positive cocci showed great recovery capacity.
TI  - Actinomyces naeslundii displays variant fimP and fimA fimbrial subunit genes corresponding to different types of acidic proline-rich protein and beta-linked galactosamine binding specificity.
AB  - Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2 bind to acidic proline-rich proteins (APRPs) and statherin via type 1 fimbriae and to beta-linked galactosamine (GalNAcbeta) structures via type 2 fimbriae. In addition, A. naeslundii displays two types of binding specificity for both APRPs-statherin and GalNAcbeta, while Actinomyces odontolyticus binds to unknown structures. To study the molecular basis for these binding specificities, DNA fragments spanning the entire or central portions of fimP (type 1) and fimA (type 2) fimbrial subunit genes were amplified by PCR from strains of genospecies 1 and 2 and hybridized with DNA from two independent collections of oral Actinomyces isolates. Isolates of genospecies 1 and 2 and A. odontolyticus, but no other Actinomyces species, were positive for hybridization with fimP and fimA full-length probes irrespective of binding to APRPs and statherin, GalNAcbeta, or unknown structures. Isolates of genospecies 1 and 2, with deviating patterns of GalNAcbeta1-3Galalpha-O-ethyl-inhibitable coaggregation with Streptococcus oralis Ss34 and MPB1, were distinguished by a fimA central probe from genospecies 1 and 2, respectively. Furthermore, isolates of genospecies 1 and 2 displaying preferential binding to APRPs over statherin were positive with a fimP central probe, while a genospecies 2 strain with the opposite binding preference was not. The sequences of fimP and fimA central gene segments were highly conserved among isolates with the same, but diversified between those with a variant, binding specificity. In conclusion, A. naeslundii exhibits variant fimP and fimA genes corresponding to diverse APRP and GalNAcbeta specificities, respectively, while A. odontolyticus has a genetically related but distinct adhesin binding specificity.
TI  - Differentiation of oral Actinomyces species by 16S ribosomal DNA polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism.
AB  - 16S rDNA polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was used to generate restriction profiles of the reference strains, including the American Type Culture Collection type strains, of oral Actinomyces spp., i.e., A. israelii, A. gerencseriae, A. naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2, A. odontolyticus, A. meyeri and A. georgiae, and 23 Actinomyces strains isolated from human dental plaque. The 16S rRNA gene sequences from isolated genomic DNA samples were amplified by PCR. The PCR products were purified and characterized by single digestion with four restriction endonucleases, i.e., MnlI, HaeIII, CfoI, or HpaII. Among them, MnlI was found to discriminate the respective reference strains. The clinical isolates were assigned to one of the species, i.e., A. gerencseriae, A. naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2 and A. odontolyticus, on the basis of their restriction profiles by single digestion with MnlI. Thus, 16S rDNA PCR-RFLP, using MnlI, is a rapid and reliable method for the differentiation of oral Actinomyces spp.
TI  - Microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  - It has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. The purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. The presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. Similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. Community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. One complex consisted of the tightly related group: Bacteroides forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola. The 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the Fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Peptostreptococcus micros. Species associated with this group included: Eubacterium nodatum, Campylobacter rectus, Campylobacter showae, Streptococcus constellatus and Campylobacter gracilis. The 3rd complex consisted of Streptococcus sanguis, S. oralis, S. mitis, S. gordonii and S. intermedius. The 4th complex was comprised of 3 Capnocytophaga species, Campylobacter concisus, Eikenella corrodens and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. The 5th complex consisted of Veillonella parvula and Actinomyces odontolyticus. A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, Selenomonas noxia and Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (A. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. The 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.
TI  - Empyema necessitatis due to Actinomyces odontolyticus.
AB  
TI  - Periodontal bacteria colonizing oral mucous membranes in edentulous patients wearing dental implants.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of the microbiota on  the oral mucosal surfaces and in the peri-implant pocket in edentulous subjects with a past history of periodontitis. Twenty edentulous subjects wearing dental implants for at least one year and with a history of periodontitis participated in this study. Clinical parameters were assessed (plaque, redness, swelling, peri-implant probing depth [PIPD], and bleeding on probing) and microbiological samples were taken (oral mucosal surfaces, saliva, plaque, and peri-implant pocket). Based on the clinical results, the group as a whole showed healthy peri-implant tissues. A mean PIPD of 3.6 mm was found. A statistically significant correlation was found between the PIPD and bleeding upon probing, plaque scores, redness, and swelling. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis were not detected. The subjects harboring Prevotella intermedia showed presence of PIPD of > or = 5 mm. All subjects harbored Peptostreptococcus spp., Fusobacterium spp., and other Prevotella species. Actinomyces odontolyticus, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter rectus, Pseudomonas spp., and enterobacteria were detected less frequently. Three subjects showed signs of overt soft tissue inflammation. They harbored higher proportions of Peptostreptococcus spp. than the other subjects. The results corroborate the suggestion that the primary source of colonization for dental implants in edentulous patients are the oral mucous membranes. The results indicate that the microbiota of subjects wearing dental implants with a past history of periodontitis are composed of bacteria associated with a healthy periodontium or gingivitis. It is suggested that elimination of the subgingival environment by extraction of all natural teeth probably initiates the disappearance of the two periodontal bacteria A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis.
TI  - Variations in the predominant cultivable microflora of dental plaque at defined subsites on approximal tooth surfaces in children.
AB  - The distribution and composition of the resident microflora were determined in approximal gingival margin plaque from 21 premolars extracted from schoolchildren (mean age 12.0 +/- 1.8 yr). Indigo carmine (5% w v) was used to visualize plaque to facilitate sampling. About 1 mm2 of plaque was removed from sites away from (A), to the side of (S), and below (B) the contact area. Plaque samples were dispersed, serially diluted, and cultured on selective and non-selective agar media. An average of seven to nine species was found at each subsite. Streptococcus and Actinomyces were subdivided on the basis of a range of biochemical tests. The predominant Actinomyces and streptococcal species at most subsites were A. naeslundii and Strep. mitis biovar I. A. naeslundii and A. odontolyticus were isolated more often at subsite B (90.5 and 57.1%, respectively), and A. israelii at subsite S (66.7%) Strep. mitis 1 and Strep. sanguis were found more frequently at subsite S (76.2 and 66.7% respectively), whereas Strep mutans, Strep. sobrinus, Strep. gordonii and Veillonella spp. were recovered most commonly from subsite B (85.7, 33.3, 38.1 and 76.2%, respectively). The isolation frequencies of Strep. mutans and Strep. sobrinus were significantly higher at subsite B (A B p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). Veillonella spp. were significantly higher at subsites B and S (A < B, p > 0.01; B > S, p < 0.05), while Neisseria spp. were most common at subsite A (A > B. p > 0.03). IgAl protease-producing species were found at each subsite, but they formed only a small proportion of the total Streptococcus population. This study has shown that local variations were evident at different subsites, both with respect to species prevalence and to proportions of each species within each subsite. The population shifts in gingival margin plaque appear to relate to the location of plaque in relation to the most caries-prone site below the contact area B.
TI  - Transfection of Actinomyces spp. by genomic DNA of bacteriophages from human dental plaque.
AB  - Bacteriophages that produced turbid or clear zones of lysis in strains of Actinomyces were isolated from 22 of 124 samples of fresh human dental plaque. All human and nonhuman strains of Actinomyces viscosus or Actinomyces naeslundii tested in this study were sensitive to infection by one or more of these phages. In contrast, none of the Actinomyces odontolyticus, Actinomyces israelii, or Actinomyces bovis strains tested were susceptible. Results of restriction endonuclease analyses indicated that the genomes of these phages consisted of double-stranded DNA molecules ranging in size between 16 and 60 kbp. Sequence homology under hybridization conditions of high stringency was observed among a few of the isolated phages. A lysogenized isolate of A. viscosus MG-1 was obtained following infection with a temperate phage, designated phi 225. Results of Southern blot analyses indicated that phi 225 replicated as a plasmid in the lysogenized strain. Genomic DNA from several lytic phages was used to establish conditions for transfection by electroporation of strains of Actinomyces spp. Efficiencies of DNA transfer ranged from 10(2) to 10(5) plaque-forming units per microgram of DNA were obtained under optimal transfection conditions. The results of these studies demonstrate that transfer of genetic information in Actinomyces spp. can be achieved by transfection.
TI  - [Mandibular actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces odontolyticus].

TI  - Polymicrobial brain abscess involving Haemophilus paraphrophilus and Actinomyces  odontolyticus.
AB  - A case of brain abscess involving Haemophilus paraphrophilus and Actinomyces odontolyticus is presented. This combination of organisms has not previously been described. All brain abscess specimens should routinely be processed rapidly and cultured for a prolonged period to ensure recovery of fastidious organisms which may have implications for antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Systemic antimicrobial treatment and guided tissue regeneration. Clinical and microbiological effects in furcation defects.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to study the microbiota associated with furcation-involved teeth before and after treatment by the guided tissue regeneration procedure (GTR) with non-resorbable ePTFE membranes, and to evaluate the benefit of additional systemic antimicrobial therapy (ornidazole). Each of 10 patients contributed 1 pair of bilateral mandibular molars with comparable furcation defects. 5 defects were treated with a membrane and the active drug, 5 were treated without a membrane but with the active drug, 5 were treated with a membrane and a placebo, and 5 were treated with neither a membrane nor the active drug. Considerable differences were found in the healing response of furcation defects treated with or without the antimicrobial agent. More horizontal attachment gain and increase in bone density was obtained in patients receiving the active drug than in patients receiving the placebo. With 1 exception, all sites with increasing horizontal probing depth were found in patients of the placebo group. Treatment with membrane plus ornidazole resulted in 0.7 mm mean recession and -1.2 mm mean decrease in horizontal probing depth. Sites treated with membranes generally tended to be positive for 15 target micro-organisms more often than sites treated without a membrane. This was particularly evident for Fusobacterium, Prevotella intermedia and Actinomyces odontolyticus. Whereas GTR-treated sites were often already positive upon removal of the membrane, re-emergence of target organisms seemed to be more delayed in the conventionally-treated sites.
TI  - Actinomyces odontolyticus thoracopulmonary infections. Two cases in lung and heart-lung transplant recipients and a review of the literature.
AB  - We present the first case of mediastinitis and the third case of pneumonia attributed to Actinomyces odontolyticus. The first patient presented 10 months after single-lung transplant with a subacute apical infiltrate in the native lung and responded to therapy with oral penicillin. The second patient developed pyogenic mediastinitis 25 days after a heart-lung transplant and required sternal debridement and intravenous penicillin. We also review the literature on thoracopulmonary infections due to A odontolyticus.
TI  - Rapid characterization of periodontal bacterial isolates by using fluorogenic substrate tests.
AB  - Eighty-nine species of subgingival bacteria, represented by 121 reference strains and 892 patient isolates, including gram-negative, gram-positive, aerobic, facultatively anaerobic, microaerophilic, and anaerobic species, were characterized with a panel of fluorogenic, 4-methylumbelliferyl-linked substrate tests. Identifications of all patient isolates were confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of whole-cell proteins relative to reference strains. Characteristic profiles of positive fluorogenic reactions differentiated most of the species, including five Porphyromonas species, six pigmenting and five nonpigmenting Prevotella species, Bacteroides forsythus, three Capnocytophaga species, six Actinomyces species, four Propionibacterium species, and eight Streptococcus species. Two mannoside isomers differentiated Actinomyces israelii and Actinomyces gerencseriae. In addition to Porphyromonas gingivalis, B. forsythus, and Capnocytophaga species, Fusobacterium alocis, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Actinomyces meyeri, and Bifidobacterium dentium were all positive for so-called trypsin-like activity. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Campylobacter species were nonreactive with the carbohydrate-based substrates tested. Fluorogenic substrate tests provided a sensitive and simple method for biochemical characterization that could presumptively identify to species level most subgingival isolates within 4 h. The method was ideal for rapidly obtaining presumptive identifications of isolates prior to confirming identifications by definitive methods, such as SDS-PAGE.
TI  - Germicide effect of several glass ionomer cements.
AB  - One the most significant characteristics of glass ionomer cements is their ability to release fluoride compounds. This study was carried out to try establish relationships between this property and the possible effect on the growth of microorganisms that are found in carious lesions, Agar BHI medium containing Petri dishes were flooded with strains of Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces israelii and Actinomyces odontolyticus. Cavities were then prepared in the agar and filled with mixtures of several glass ionomer cements. Some of them were polymerizable resin containing products. A zinc phosphate and a zinc oxide-eugenol cement were used as controls. After a seven day incubation at 37 degrees C under anaerobic conditions the inhibition halos around the specimens were measured in a way similar to that used for antibiograms. The statistical analysis of the results showed no significant differences among Actinomyces strains but a significant difference one among cements. Even when no definitive conclusions could be drawn it is worth taking into consideration the effect of glass ionomer cements on microorganisms such as the Actinomyces and continuing studies to establish more clearly what is required from the material to produce a clinically significant outcome.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological changes associated with an altered subgingival environment induced by periodontal pocket reduction.
AB  - The purpose of the present investigation was to study the effect of an altered subgingival environment, induced by changing the local soft tissue morphology, i.e., pocket depth reduction, on the subgingival microbiota and the clinical conditions. 7 patients aged 30-60 years with generalized marginal periodontitis were selected. Patients were instructed in proper oral hygiene and all teeth were cleaned supragingivally. Mucoperiosteal flaps were raised and the bone re-contoured to eliminate angular bony defects. While the control teeth were carefully debrided and thoroughly root planed, no root instrumentation was performed on the test teeth. Calculus deposits visible to the naked eye were only chipped-off with the tip of a scaler. The flaps were apically repositioned and sutured at the level of the bone crest. Clinical parameters showed a similar pattern of response in the test and control sites over a one year observation period post therapy. Probing depths and probing attachment levels were significantly reduced one month after surgery and remained at a lower level. A significant decrease was also noted for total anaerobic viable bacterial counts. The proportion of the Gram-negative anaerobic rods decreased significantly in both groups. P. gingivalis, Fusobacterium sp., C rectus were detected significantly less often after treatment in both groups. Capnocytophaga and A. odontolyticus, on the other hand, were more frequently isolated after therapy. These findings corroborate the concept that the reduction of selected subgingival microorganisms is the key element for the success of periodontal therapy, rather than the removal of tooth substance and mineralized deposits by root instrumentation.
TI  - Bacteriology of skin and soft-tissue infections: comparison of infections in intravenous drug users and individuals with no history of intravenous drug use.
AB  - The bacteriology of cutaneous or subcutaneous abscesses (86 specimens) among intravenous drug users (IVDUs) was compared with the bacteriology of abscesses (74 specimens) in patients with no history of intravenous drug use (non-IVDUs). The IVDU abscesses yielded 173 aerobes and 131 anaerobes. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common aerobe isolated (50% of specimens yielded this isolate), followed by "Streptococcus milleri" (46%). The commonly encountered anaerobes were Fusobacterium nucleatum (17%), pigmented Prevotella species (22%), Peptostreptococcus micros (17%), Actinomyces odontolyticus (15%), and Veillonella species (13%). The non-IVDU isolates included 116 aerobes and 106 anaerobes. S. aureus was isolated from 53% of these specimens, followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci (19%), "S. milleri" (19%), and Streptococcus pyogenes (16%). The main groups of anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus species (35%), Bacteroides species (19%), and gram-positive bacilli (31%). Overall, 67% of the IVDU isolates were of oral origin, compared with 25% of the non-IVDU isolates. Of the specimens from IVDUs and non-IVDUs, 48% and 67%, respectively, yielded only aerobes, and 2% and 4%, respectively, yielded only anaerobes. Sixty-four percent of the patients had one or more beta-lactamase-producing organisms.
TI  - Carbohydrate depletion of immunoglobulin A1 by oral species of gram-positive rods.
AB  - Bacterial deglycosylation of immunoglobulin Al (IgA1), the dominant isotype of antibody in the oral cavity, probably provides both nutrition as well as protection to the oral bacterial community. Representative strains of oral gram-positive rods were tested for their ability to remove carbohydrates from IgA1. Detection of sialic acids was performed by means of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation (Aminex HPX-87H) and ultraviolet light absorption at 190 nm, and neutral carbohydrates were measured by HPLC separation (Capcell Pak C-18 SG 120) and ultraviolet light absorption at 245 nm after derivatization. Four strains of Actinomyces naeslundii, two strains of Corynebacterium matruchotii and one of two strains of Actinomyces odontolyticus partially or totally removed sialic acid, while two strains of Propionibacterium propionicus and the other strain of A. odontolyticus did not. Complete correlation was observed between sialic acid removal, neuraminidase activity measured with fluorogenic substrate and with one exception, altered immunoelectrophoretic mobility of IgA1. Only limited removal of other carbohydrates was observed with poor correlation to exoglycosidase activities measured with chromogenic substrates. Desialylation increases the susceptibility of glycoproteins, including IgA1, to proteolysis. Therefore, the desialylation of IgA1 by oral gram-positive rods may facilitate the proteolytic activities of other oral bacteria, and the concerted action may positively influence the survival of the bacteria in the oral community.
TI  - rRNA gene restriction patterns as possible taxonomic tools for the genus actinomyces.
AB  - Species delineation in the genus Actinomyces remains unclear, particularly regarding the two taxa, A. naeslundii and A. viscosus. The ribotyping patterns of 64 strains of Actinomyces, representing 8 species and comprising different serotypes, were studied as possible taxonomic tools, using an acetyl-aminofluorene (AAF)-labelled E. coli 16S + 23S rRNA probe. Similarities between patterns were assessed using Jaccard's coefficient and clustering achieved using the unweighted pair-group method with average linkage (UPGMA) on a Macintosh II (Apple, Cupertino, USA) computer. The dendrogram obtained from the ribotypes gave results which were in reasonable agreement with many previous reports: A. bovis, A. gerensceriae, A. israelii, A. meyerii, A. odontolyticus and A. pyogenes were found to be distinct species but the two taxa A. naeslundii and A. viscosus remained unclear. Further investigations, using a larger number of A. naeslundii and A. viscosus strains and other endonucleases, need to be carried out to provide more information concerning the relatedness of these two taxa. Nevertheless, these preliminary results suggested that the Actinomyces chromosome contains multiple rRNA operons which may be used as an epidemiological and taxonomical tool.
TI  - Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates in association with disseminated actinomycosis.
AB  - The most common infectious cause of bilateral upper-lobe pulmonary disease is tuberculosis. However, we recently encountered a patient with bilateral apical infiltrates and multiple soft-tissue abscesses caused by Actinomyces odontolyticus. Other findings included fever, weight loss, and leukocytosis, and the patient's only known source of immunosuppression was a long history of alcoholism. There was no history of diabetes, steroid use, or other chronic underlying disease. The diagnosis was made by culture of drainage fluid from one abscess. Therapy with intravenous penicillin G led to rapid clinical improvement and reduction in the infiltrates. To our knowledge, the presentation of pulmonary infection, with bilateral apical infiltrates due to A. odontolyticus has not been previously reported in the medical literature.
TI  - Sacroiliitis and septicemia caused by Campylobacter rectus and Actinomyces odontolyticus.
AB  - Campylobacter rectus, formerly known as Wolinella recta, is an anaerobic Gram-negative bacillus, generally recognized as an agent responsible for severe periodontitis; only two cases of extra-oral infections have been reported. The first case of septicemia with C rectus and Actinomyces odontolyticus is described in a 37-year-old farmer who suffered from severe sacroiliitis. Also presented are a review of C rectus in human pathology, and a brief review of pyogenic sacroiliitis, a rather rare disease.
TI  - Laser-induced autofluorescence for medical diagnosis.
AB  - The naturally occurring autofluorescence of cells and tissues is based on biomolecules containing intrinsic fluorophores, such as porphyrins, the amino acids tryptophan and tyrosine, and the coenzymes NADH, NADPH, and flavins. Coenzymes fluoresce in the blue/green spectral region (fluorecence lifetimes: 0.5-6 ns) and are highly sensitive indicators of metabolic function. Steadystate and time-resolved blue-green autofluorescence is, therefore, an appropriate measure of the function of the respiratory chain as well as of cellular and tissue damage. Autofluorescence in the yellow/red spectral region is based mainly on endogenous porphyrins and metalloporphyrins, such as coproporphyrin, protoporphyrin (fluorescence lifetime of porphyrin monomers: >10 ns), and Zn-protoporphyrin (2 ns). Various pathological microorganisms such asPropionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Bacteroides intermedius, andSaccharomyces cerevisiae are able to synthesize large amounts of these fluorophores and can therefore be located. This permits fluorescence-based detection of a variety of diseases, including early-stage dental caries, dental plaque, acne vulgaris, otitis externa, and squamous cell carcinoma. The sensitivity of noninvasive autofluorescence diagnostics can be enhanced by time-gated fluorescence measurements using an appropriate time delay between ultrashort laser excitation and detection. For example, videocameras with ultrafast shutters, in the nanosecond region, can be used to create "caries images" of the teeth. Alternatively, autofluorescence can be enhanced by stimulating protoporphyrin biosynthesis with the exogenously administered porphyrin precursor 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). The fluorophore protoporphyrin IX (PP IX) is photolabile and photodynamically active. Irradiation of PP IX-containing tissue results in cytotoxic reactions which correlate with modifications in fluorescence due to photobleaching and singlet oxygen-dependent photoproduct formation. Therefore, on-line autofluorescence measurements during the phototreatment can yield information on the efficiency of ALA-based photodynamic therapy.
TI  - [Thoracic actinomycosis].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thoracic actinomycosis is an rare disease in our medium. This fact, together with the variability of its forms of presentation and the difficulty in isolating its etiologic agent, make its diagnosis, particularly difficult. METHODS: A series of 8 cases diagnosed in the years 1988, 1989 and 1990 in two centers (Hospital de Bellvitge-Princeps d'Espanya and Hospital de l'Esperanca) is described with evaluation of the clinical and analytical data and the therapy applied. RESULTS: Species were only identified in 3 cases with Actinomyces israelii in two and Actinomyces odontolyticus in the third. The proven association with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the presence of distant septic metastasis and eosinophilic pleuritis as forms of presentation are of note. Medical treatment was penicillin or derivatives in all the cases except one which was treated with diagnostic/therapeutic segmentectomy. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that when any subacute involvement of the thoracic and/or pleuropulmonary wall specific cultures should be carried out to discard eventual thoracic actinomycosis.
TI  - Peritonsillar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, mediastinitis, and nonclostridial anaerobic myonecrosis: a case report.
AB  - Peritonsillar abscess is a potentially life-threatening complication of acute tonsillitis. On occasion, peritonsillar abscess can extend to neck spaces and/or to the mediastinum. We describe a case of a patient with a peritonsillar abscess that extended to the neck, producing bilateral retropharyngeal abscesses and myonecrosis of the strap muscles. Culture of a specimen of the necrotic muscle yielded Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella buccae, Lactobacillus catenaforme, another Lactobacillus species, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and some nonanaerobes. Culture of the peritonsillar abscess yielded P. intermedia and P. buccae plus P. anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Bifidobacterium dentium, viridans and group F streptococci, and Citrobacter diversus. Culture of the retropharyngeal abscess yielded Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces odontolyticus in addition to most of the aforementioned organisms. The patient underwent repeated drainage and debridement procedures and was treated with various antimicrobial agents and ultimately recovered. This case highlights the polymicrobial nature of peritonsillar abscess and the serious complications that this infection may lead to.
TI  - Bacteriologic findings in peritonsillar abscesses in young adults.
AB  - Aspirated pus samples from 124 patients with peritonsillar abscess were cultured  quantitatively for aerobes and anaerobes. A total of 98% of the samples yielded bacteria. Of the 550 isolates obtained (mean, 4.4 per patient), 143 were aerobes (representing 16 species or groups) and 407 were anaerobes (representing 40 species or groups). Aerobes were isolated from 86% of patients-alone in 20 cases and together with anaerobes in 87. The most common aerobic isolates were Streptococcus pyogenes (isolated from 45% of patients), Streptococcus milleri group organisms (27%), Haemophilus influenzae (11%), and viridans streptococci (11%). Anaerobes were isolated from 82% of the samples and as a sole finding from 15 abscesses. Fusobacterium necrophorum and Prevotella melaninogenica were both isolated from 38% of patients, Prevotella intermedia from 32%, Peptostreptococcus micros from 27%, Fusobacterium nucleatum from 26%, and Actinomyces odontolyticus from 23%. The rate of previous tonsillar/peritonsillar infections was lowest (25%) among patients infected with S. pyogenes and highest (52%) among those infected with F. necrophorum (P < .01). Recurrences and/or related tonsillectomies were more common among patients infected with F. necrophorum than among those infected with S. pyogenes (57% vs. 19%; P < .0001) or with S. milleri group organisms (43% vs. 19%; P < .05). beta-Lactamase was produced by only 38% of the 73 isolates of Prevotella species tested; however, 56% of the 36 patients studied harbored one or more such strains.
TI  - Coaggregation of Prevotella intermedia with oral Actinomyces species.
AB  - Five strains of Prevotella intermedia were examined for their ability to coaggregate with various gram-positive and gram-negative species of oral bacteria. Two of the P. intermedia strains coaggregated with selected Actinomyces species, P. intermedia 27 with Actinomyces viscosus T14V and Actinomyces naeslundii ATCC 12104, PK606, PK984, and PK947, and P. intermedia 113 with Actinomyces odontolyticus WVU 1546 and Actinomyces israelii WVU 838. Exposure of both Prevotella strains but not the Actinomyces strains to heat, trypsin, or proteinase K abolished most coaggregations. All pairs were disaggregated by the addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate, but only those coaggregations involving P. intermedia 113 were reversed by the addition of 2.0 M urea. P. intermedia 27 was sensitive to periodate oxidation, whereas the partner strains were stable to this treatment. Most coaggregations occurred in the presence of saliva; however, reactions involving P. intermedia 27 were not as strong as those of buffer-suspended cells. Treatment of both P. intermedia 113 coaggregations pairs with proteinase K and the results obtained from suspensions of these pairs in saliva suggest that different surface molecules of this P. intermedia strain may mediate each of these coaggregations. These data suggest that all of these coaggregations involve either a protein or glycoprotein on the Prevotella strain, which may interact with carbohydrates or carbohydrate-containing molecules on the surface of the Actinomyces strain.
TI  - [Pulmonary actinomycosis: caused by Actinomyces odontolyticus?].
AB  - Primary pulmonary actinomycosis is a purulent bronchopulmonary disease mimicking  tuberculosis. The histological lesions contain characteristic yellow granules. The organism most frequently responsible for the disease is Actinomyces israeli. We report the first case to our knowledge where Actinomyces odontolyticus seems to be involved.
TI  - Comparison of the distribution of Actinomyces in dental plaque on inserted enamel and natural tooth surfaces in periodontal health and disease.
AB  - The distribution of Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces  odontolyticus in healthy and diseased adult populations was studied in 3 different ways. First, supragingival plaque formation at 2 through 72 h was examined in 12 periodontally healthy adults using a removable pre-measured surface of enamel bonded to molars and premolars. Second, a cross-sectional examination of the composition of both supragingival and subgingival plaque of unknown age was conducted in 205 adults exhibiting periodontal health to moderate disease. Third, the effects of oral hygiene instruction and root planing on the subgingival microflora of a subset of 19 subjects with moderate periodontitis were examined. The evaluation of 12 adults revealed that the predominant species in early plaque formation (2, 4 and 8 h) was A. odontolyticus. A. viscosus and A. naeslundii were present in developing plaques in almost all subjects in 2-h plaque, but absent in half the subjects when 4-, 8- or 24-h plaque was examined. These two species significantly increased in numbers per mm2 enamel surface area in 48- and 72-h plaques. A. odontolyticus was not related to clinical signs of periodontal disease in 205 adults, and its subgingival proportions in plaque did not change following periodontal treatment of 19 individuals. A. naeslundii was found in significantly higher numbers in supragingival than subgingival plaques in the 205 adults examined. The mean proportion of A. naeslundii significantly decreased as the magnitude of probing depth and attachment loss increased. The proportions of A. naeslundii and A. viscosus were found to be significantly increased in subgingival plaques following periodontal treatment.
TI  - Evaluation of the RapID ANA II and API ZYM systems for identification of Actinomyces species from clinical specimens.
AB  - Classification and identification of fermentative actinomycetes are labor-intensive and problematic. In this study, we evaluated the applicability and reliability of the RapID ANA II system (Innovative Diagnostic Systems, Inc., Atlanta, Ga.) and the discriminatory value of the API ZYM system (Societes Analytab Products Inc., La Balme Les Grottes, France) in the identification of Actinomyces-like bacteria by using conventional methods as a reference. Eighty-five strains, including 71 isolates from mixed anaerobic infections and 14 reference strains, were tested. The RapID ANA II system correctly identified all Actinomyces odontolyticus strains and 65% of Actinomyces israelii strains. All Arcanobacterium haemolyticum strains were misidentified as Actinomyces pyogenes. The most common isolates in the study were Actinomyces meyeri-like organisms, 84% of which, however, were aerotolerant. The identification of these aerotolerant strains thus remains unresolved and warrants further studies. New characteristics and changes to the conventional API ZYM enzyme profiles are suggested. The API ZYM enzyme profiles of A. odontolyticus and A. israelii were very similar, the only discriminating enzyme being alpha-fucosidase. In differentiation between A. pyogenes and Arcanobacterium haemolyticum, the production of beta-glucuronidase by the former and the production of acid phosphatase by the latter are suggested as new helpful characteristics for use in clinical laboratories. In summary, the RapID ANA II and API ZYM systems can be used as rapid preliminary methods in the identification of Actinomyces species but accurate identification requires supplementary conventional tests and gas-liquid chromatography.
TI  - A case of empyema thoracis caused by actinomycosis.
AB  - A female patient who presented with left empyema thoracis caused by Actinomyces odontolyticus is reported. She responded to treatment with penicillin and metronidazole but after 3 weeks developed leucopenia complicated by gram-negative septicaemia. Leucopenia improved rapidly on withdrawal of metronidazole. Treatment was continued with a prolonged course of penicillin and she made an uneventful recovery.
TI  - [Binding of Actinomyces viscosus to collagen].
AB  - The ability of collagen adsorbed on apatitic surfaces to promote adhesion of A. viscosus was studied. Treatment of hydroxyapatite (HA) with human type I or type III collagen strongly promoted adhesion of A. viscosus LY7. TEM observations revealed that A. viscosus also attached to fibrils prepared from human type I collagen. The alpha(2) polypeptide derived from type I collagen exhibited moderate activity in promoting binding. Mutans of A. viscosus which possess type I fimbriae, but not type 2 fimbriae or no fimbriae, also bound to collagen-treated HA. This suggests that the adhesin responsible was associated with type I fimbriae, strains of A. israelii and A. odontolyticus also exhibited strong binding to collagen-treated HA. The avidity of Actinomyces species for collagen would seem to be partially responsible for the high proportions of these organisms found on root surfaces.
TI  - Successful treatment of feline pyothorax associated with an Actinomyces species and Bacteroides melanogenicus.
AB  - A cat was presented to a veterinary clinic with a severe pleural effusion from which an organism later identified as an Actinomyces spp., probably A. odontolyticus, was isolated along with Bacteroides melanogenicus. It was successfully treated with surgical drainage and a combination of amoxycillin and sulphadiazine/trimethoprim. The fluid was cytologically examined to obtain a provisional diagnosis and to allow treatment to be initiated while the organisms were cultured and identified. The cat is now clinically normal except for slight abdominal respiration, presumably resulting from adhesions following the severe infection.
TI  - Conservation of an Actinomyces viscosus T14V type 1 fimbrial subunit homolog among divergent groups of Actinomyces spp.
AB  - The type 1 fimbrial subunit gene of the human Actinomyces viscosus T14V was used  as a DNA probe in Southern analyses to detect related DNA sequences in 16 of 30 strains of Actinomyces spp. under conditions of high stringency. The organisms with homology to the DNA probe included two human and six nonhuman A. viscosus, three human and three nonhuman A. naeslundii, and two A. bovis isolates. Homologous DNA sequences were not detected in strains of A. odontolyticus and A. israelii examined in this study. Northern (RNA) blot analysis revealed expression of a transcript from each of the A. viscosus and A. naeslundii strains and from one A. bovis strain that was comparable in size to that detected from A. viscosus T14V. Cell surface fimbriae were observed on a majority of the strains that expressed the transcript. Various degrees of cross-immunoreactivities between these strains and antibodies specific for type 1 fimbriae of A. viscosus T14V were also observed by colony immunoassay. Thus, the data clearly demonstrate the existence in, and expression by, divergent Actinomyces groups of genomic sequences that are closely related to the type 1 fimbriae of A. viscosus T14V.
TI  - The endodontic microflora revisited.
AB  - The microbial flora of 35 dental root canals were examined, taking care to maintain the viability of obligate anaerobes which accounted for 45% of total isolations, while streptococcal species accounted for 24% of the total species isolated. Individual root canals yielded a maximum of eight bacterial species. A total of 40 different species was isolated of which the most prevalent were the facultative anaerobe Streptococcus sanguis and the obligate anaerobe, Peptostreptococcus micros (both in 23% of root canals), followed by Eubacterium aerofaciens and the 'Streptococcus milleri group' (both 17%) then Prevotella melaninogenica (formerly Bacteroides melaninogenicus), Enterococcus faecalis and Prevotella oralis (formerly Bacteroides oralis), which were each isolated from 14% of root canals. Highly significant associations were discovered between four pairs of species, viz P. melaninogenica with P. micros, P. melaninogenica with P. oralis, Prevotella corporis with Streptococcus morbillorum and Actinomyces odontolyticus with E. faecalis.
TI  - Use of monoclonal antibodies with neutralizing effects on toxic antigens from human bacterial plaque to detect specific bacteria by colony blotting.
AB  - Inflammatory periodontal diseases are provoked by bacteria which adhere to teeth  at the gingival margin and form plaques containing toxins detectable by their effect on mammalian cells in culture. The aim of this study was to make toxin-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and determine whether they detect antigen in specific oral bacteria. Bacterial plaque was collected from teeth and homogenized, and the fluid phase (plaque extract) was boiled or first fractionated over Sephacryl S-300. Hybridomas from immunized mice secreted immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies which reacted to plaque antigens. Neutralization was detected by an increase in the growth of HL60 cells which were exposed to plaque toxins in the presence of IgM from hybridoma culture or ascitic fluids. However, the neutralization was obvious only when the plaque toxins reduced growth by 50% or less. Plaque toxin preparations were found to contain proteases which hydrolyzed all of the IgM in ascitic fluids within 24 h. Replenishing the IgM daily preserved protection compared with protection from IgM from other hybridomas or saline only. The decrease in the specific activity of plaque proteins caused by replenishing one such antibody (3hE5) was 2.5-fold compared with activity with unreplenished 3hE5, 3.8-fold compared with activity with saline only, and 10.7-fold compared with activity with replenished, unrelated antibody. The neutralizing IgM detected an array of 14,000- to 22,000-molecular-weight antigens. The native toxins may be aggregates of these antigens, or the array may indicate fragments of an undetected, larger antigen or a common, nonpeptide adduct. Only 0.5 to 0.8% of the bacteria from sites with periodontitis and grown on blood agar contained antigen. One group of reactive bacteria was identified as Actinomyces odontolyticus serotype I. Other isolates were identified as Staphylococcus epidermidis, but antigen disappeared from the these isolates within 6 weeks of subculture. Epitope-containing antigens were also found in streptococcal and Eikenella isolates, and it is likely that the antigens from only some of these bacteria are toxic.
TI  - Binding of Actinomyces viscosus to collagen: association with the type 1 fimbrial adhesin.
AB  - Treatment of hydroxyapatite (HA) with human type I or type III collagen strongly  promoted adhesion of Actinomyces viscosus LY7 cells. Treatment with human type V collagen was somewhat less effective while treatment with human type IV or rat type I collagen was significantly less effective. Electron microscopic observations revealed that A. viscosus cells also attached to fibrils prepared from human type I collagen. The alpha 1 (1) polypeptide chain derived from type I collagen was ineffective in promoting binding and the alpha 2 (1) polypeptide chain exhibited moderate activity. Heat- or urea-denatured type I collagens were also ineffective in promoting binding. Mutants of A. viscosus that possess type 1 fimbriae, but not type 2 fimbriae or no fimbriae, also bound to collagen-treated HA; this suggests that the adhesin responsible was associated with type 1 fimbriae. Strains of Actinomyces israelii and Actinomyces odontolyticus also exhibited strong binding to collagen-treated HA, while Actinomyces naeslundii ATCC 12104 did not. The avidity of Actinomyces species for collagen would seem to be at least partially responsible for the high proportions of these organisms found on cemental and root tooth surfaces.
TI  - Changes in subgingival microbiota during puberty. A 4-year longitudinal study.
AB  - It was the purpose of the present investigation to monitor the composition of the subgingival microbiota at selected sites in individuals passing through puberty and to correlate observed changes with the development of pubertal maturation. Between the ages of 11 and 14 years, pubertal and skeletal maturation was monitored annually in 22 boys and 20 girls. During this time, subgingival microbial samples were taken every 4th to 5th month (10 times in 4 years) mesially of the upper first molars. High values in total bacterial counts were reached after the onset of puberty, followed by a decrease towards the end of the observation period. The frequency of detection of Actinomyces odontolyticus and of Capnocytophaga sp. increased with time. The frequencies of other selected species, specifically of black pigmenting Bacteriodes sp. were not found to increase when tested by linear and quadratic models of time trend. However, a statistically significant rise in the frequency of detecting B. intermedius and B. melaninogenicus was noted in the initial pubertal phase identified by the onset of testicular growth in boys (p = 0.05). A significant relationship also existed between testes growth and increase of A. odontolyticus (p less than 0.01). In girls, a similar increase was obtained for A. odontolyticus when studied in relation to the Tanner scores for breast development (p less than 0.01). The changes observed in the subgingival microbiota during puberty may be related to the development of gingivitis, which was demonstrated by a higher tendency for gingival bleeding during the course of the pubertal maturation process.
TI  - Tetrameric manganese superoxide dismutases from anaerobic Actinomyces.
AB  - Superoxide dismutase was isolated from each of the anaerobically grown organisms  Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces strain E1S.25D, and Actinomyces odontolyticus. The enzymes were 100,000-110,000 mol wt acidic proteins (pI 4.3-4.6) and contained Mn and Zn, but no detectable Fe. The Mn and Zn content varied with the enzyme source. A. naeslundii superoxide dismutase, specific activity 2200 U/mg, contained 2.3 g atoms Mn and 1.4 g atoms Zn per mole tetramer whereas A. odontolyticus SOD, specific activity 700 U/mg, contained 1.4 g atoms Mn and 1.8 g atoms Zn per mole tetramer. Actinomyces strain E1S.25D, specific activity 1300 U/mg, contained 1.8 g atoms Mn and 1.2 g atoms Zn per mole tetramer. The amino acid compositions of the enzymes were comparable except for arginine, lysine, and tryptophan content. The enzymatic activity of each enzyme was stable in 5 mM H2O2 at 23 degrees C for 2 h. The enzymes were only modestly inhibited by 20 mM NaN3. The enzymatic activity was increased at low ionic strength but was markedly decreased at increased ionic strength with each salt tested except sodium perchlorate, which caused marked inhibition even at low ionic strength. Polyclonal antibodies to A. naeslundii and Actinomyces strain E1S.25D precipitated and inactivated their respective antigens whereas the precipitated A. odontolyticus superoxide dismutase-antibody complex retained virtually full catalytic activity. Immunological studies revealed that the native A. naeslundii and Actinomyces strain E1S.25D MnSODs share common epitopes and cross-reacted with precipitin lines of complete identity in Ouchterlony double diffusion gels. Antibody to the A. odontolyticus enzyme displayed only partial cross-reactivity with superoxide dismutase from the two other Actinomyces. Western blotting of the denatured antigens revealed reactivities of the antibodies that differed only slightly from the results of the Ouchterlony gels.
TI  - Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy for the identification of Actinomyces sp.  in endodontic disease.
AB  - Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was used to determine the presence of select Actinomyces sp. in a clinical survey of teeth with endodontic disease. Thirty canal samples were tested for the presence of Actinomyces sp.: A. israelii, A. odontolyticus, A. viscosus serotype I, and A. viscosus serotype II. Actinomyces sp. were identified in 18 (60%) samples. A. israelii was most frequently identified with immunofluorescence in 16 (53%) cases examined and was the test organism most often associated with endodontic disease within the restrictions of this study. Positive and negative controls were appropriate to support findings. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy can be used for the clinical identification of Actinomyces sp. in endodontic disease without the necessity of performing a parallel culture study.
TI  - Partial 16S rRNA primary structure of five Actinomyces species: phylogenetic implications and development of an Actinomyces israelii-specific oligonucleotide probe.
AB  - The intra- and intergeneric relationships of the genus Actinomyces were determined by comparing long 16S rRNA sequences, generated by reverse transcriptase. All species formed a phylogenetically coherent cluster in which Actinomyces bovis, A. viscosus, A. naeslundii, A. odontolyticus and A. israelii constituted genetically well defined species. A. israelii DSM 43322 (serotype 2) was not closely related to three other strains of this species (serotype 1) and, as judged from phylogenetic distances, could be accommodated within A. naeslundii, or represent a new species. In contrast to previous findings, members of the genus Actinomyces appear to be related to Bifidobacterium bifidum. Sequence information was used to develop an oligonucleotide probe for the A. israelii serotype 1 strains, which did not react with the serotype 2 strain or with rRNA from strains of eight Actinomyces species.
TI  - The microflora associated with the development of initial enamel decalcification  below orthodontic bands in vivo in children living in a fluoridated-water area.
AB  - Thirty-four caries-free teeth destined for orthodontic extraction were banded to  provide a protected area for the accumulation of plaque. The teeth were extracted at one, two, four, eight, and 14 days after being banded, and samples of the flora below the band were analyzed for the presence of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus 'mitior', 'mutans streptococci', Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Lactobacillus species, and Veillonella. After plaque sampling, the teeth were sent to the Royal Dental College (Copenhagen) for histological analysis. The results showed that S. mutans could colonize the area below the band after one day, but that colonization was only 100% at 14 days. Lactobacillus was only isolated from 2/8 samples at four days and from 4/8 samples at 14 days. S. sanguis and 'S. mitior' were regularly isolated at all banding times, and Veillonella was isolated from all samples. A. viscosus was the most commonly isolated Actinomyces. The numbers of Streptococcus and Veillonella were significantly higher at day 1 than at day 14 (p less than 0.05). S. mutans and A. viscosus were isolated more frequently at day 14 than at day 1 (p less than 0.01). Histological examination revealed that dissolution of the enamel below a band could occur after two days, but that even after 14 days dissolution could be questionable. Dissolution was detected in areas where S. mutans was not isolated (8/34), but S. mutans was also present in samples showing dissolution (12/34). There was no relationship between dissolution and the numbers of S. mutans; however, the isolation frequency of S. mutans was associated with dissolution (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - An in vitro study of the antibacterial and antifungal properties of an irreversible hydrocolloid impression material impregnated with disinfectant.
AB  - The difficulties associated with the disinfection of alginate (irreversible hydrocolloid) materials have resulted in the development of an irreversible hydrocolloid impression material impregnated with an antimicrobial compound, didecyldimethyl ammonium chloride. This investigation assessed the antibacterial and antifungal properties in vitro of this innovative irreversible hydrocolloid material by using the agar well technique. The microorganisms used were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Lactobacillus odontolyticus rodriguez, Actinomyces odontolyticus, mixed salivary organisms, and Candida albicans. The results showed an absence of activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Varying degrees of antibacterial activity were exhibited against the other microorganisms. It is concluded that it is not know whether the limited antibacterial and antifungal effect demonstrated in this study is sufficient to prevent bacterial and fungal colonization of the impression surface in the mouth during clinical practice.
TI  - Subgingival microflora, dental and periodontal conditions in patients with hereditary fructose intolerance.
AB  - Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) is a rare autosomally recessive disease which leads to severe hypoglycemia. The fructose-free diet of these patients apparently influences dental health. Half of the patients are free of caries, but there are no reports on their periodontal condition nor on the composition of their subgingival microflora. Therefore 18 patient with HFI were examined for the following parameters: radiographic bone loss, caries rate, gingival bleeding, occurrence of calculus, pocket depths, salivary flow rate, buffer capacity and pH from paraffin wax-stimulated saliva. Salivary S. mutans and lactobacilli were also enumerated. Specific antibody titers from whole saliva and serum to Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans gamma 4, Bacteroides gingivalis, and Capnocytophaga ochracea were determined with ELISA. Finally the subgingival plaque was analyzed by culture. Altogether 196 anaerobic or microaerophilic isolates representing 29 different species were obtained from the HFI patients and 164 isolates of 26 species from the controls. The frequency of Actinomyces odontolyticus, Veillonella parvula, and Wolinella recta in the HFI patients was significantly high The DMF-induces were lower in the study group than in the controls and so was the occurrence of S. mutans and lactobacilli in the saliva. Of the periodontal parameters examined, the only difference found was an increased incidence of gingival bleeding and calculus formation in the HFI patients. The results suggest that in the HFI patients the common gingival bleeding is associated with the more frequent occurrence of Actinomyces odontolyticus, Veillonella parvula, and Wolinella recta.
TI  - Detection of sialidase (neuraminidase) activity in Actinomyces species by using 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)alpha-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid in a filter paper spot test.
AB  - A rapid method for the detection of acetylneuraminyl hydrolase, EC 3.2.1.18 (sialidase or neuraminidase), was developed by using 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)alpha-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid as substrate in a filter paper spot test. The method was compared to conventional assays that use 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)alpha-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid and bovine submaxillary mucin and was found to be in excellent agreement. Organisms with greater than 10 U of enzyme activity (in nanomoles per minute per milligram of cell protein) gave positive reactions, while those with 2.7 to 9.0 U gave only weak reactions. Isolates with less than 2.7 U of activity were detected upon prolonged incubation. Sialidase activity was detected in 79% of 71 clinical isolates representing five species of Actinomyces. The percentage of sialidase-producing isolates of each species varied considerably: Actinomyces israelii, 63%; A. meyeri, 73%; A. naeslundii, 85%; A. odontolyticus, 73%; and A. viscosus, 100%.
TI  - Effect of zeta potential and surface energy on bacterial adhesion to uncoated and saliva-coated human enamel and dentin.
AB  - Physicochemical surface characteristics of early plaque-forming bacteria and of human tooth surfaces were measured to establish their role in bacterial adhesion to intact dental tissue slabs. In addition, the influence of an experimental salivary pellicle was evaluated. Strains of S. mutans, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, A. viscosus, and A. odontolyticus showed relatively high surface free energies (range, 99-128 mJ.m-2) and carried a negative surface charge, at both physiological (mu = 0.057) and low (mu = 0.020) ionic strengths of the medium. Very large differences in hydrophobicity were detected when the hexadecane adsorption test was used for measurement. Powdered enamel and dentin were also negatively charged at low ionic strength but were slightly positively charged in the physiological buffer. The surface free energy of enamel and dentin increased upon saliva coating, whereas the surface charge was always negative. The adhesion experiments showed: (1) large differences in the binding of various bacteria to the same surface; (2) an up to 20-fold difference in the binding of the same bacterium to different surfaces, although the binding of some strains was relatively independent of the type of surface or presence of a salivary pellicle; (3) a significant decrease in adhesion when the ionic strength of the medium was lowered, due to increased electrostatic repulsion (however, the adhesion of some bacteria was independent of the ionic strength of the medium); (4) different time-dependent adherence kinetics, depending on both the bacteria and nature of the solid surface; and (5) a propensity for plaque streptococci to bind to uncoated dentin.
TI  - The comparative cytotoxicity of periodontal bacteria.
AB  - The direct cytotoxicity of sonic extracts (SE) from nine periodontal bacteria for human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) was compared. Equivalent dosages (in terms of protein concentration) of SE were used to challenge HGF cultures. The cytotoxic potential of each SE was assessed by its ability to (1) inhibit HGF proliferation, as measured by direct cell counts; (2) inhibit 3H-thymidine incorporation in HGF cultures; or (3) cause morphological alterations of the cells in challenged cultures. The highest concentration (500 micrograms SE protein/ml) of any of the SEs used to challenge the cells was found to be markedly inhibitory to the HGFs by all three of the criteria of cytotoxicity. At the lowest dosage tested (50 micrograms SE protein/ml); only SE from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides gingivalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum caused a significant effect (greater than 90% inhibition or overt morphological abnormalities) in the HGFs as determined by any of the criteria employed. SE from Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eikenella corrodens, or Wolinella recta also inhibited cell proliferation and thymidine incorporation at this dosage; however, the degree of inhibition (5-50%) was consistently, clearly less than that of the first group of three organisms named above. The SE of the three other organisms tested (Actinomyces odontolyticus, Bacteroides intermedius, and Streptococcus sanguis) had little or no effect (0-10% inhibition) at this concentration. The data suggest that the outcome of the interaction between bacterial components and normal resident cells of the periodontium is, at least in part, a function of the bacterial species.
TI  - Thoracic, abdominal, and vertebral actinomycosis. Diagnosis and long-term therapy in three dogs.
AB  - The clinical, laboratory, radiographic, and histologic features and the response  to therapy in three dogs with actinomycosis are reported. One dog (dog 1) had a 12-cm nonresectable mass extending from the ventrolateral chest wall into the left ventricular myocardium. Another dog (dog 2) had a diffuse peritonitis with "sulfur granules" and two large masses. One of these masses was nonresectable involving adjacent abdominal structures. A third dog (dog 3) had a subvertebral mass at T1-3 producing quadraplegia. Two dogs had periosteal reactions involving adjacent sternebrae (dog 1) or ribs and vertebral bodies (dog 3) that are characteristic of Actinomyces spp infections. In dogs 1 and 2 the diagnosis was based on the morphologic and tinctorial properties of free sulfur granules and/or tissue granules. Culture results were variable. Tissue from dog 1 yielded no growth, while polymicrobial infections, which included Actinomyces spp, were identified in dogs 2 and 3. Actinomyces odontolyticus was isolated from dog 3. Although the actinomycotic granulomas were either not excised or only partially excised from dogs 1 and 2, both animals were cured by the oral administration of high doses of penicillin G for 19 and 6 months, respectively. Dog 3 responded dramatically to the same antibiotic therapy given for 5 months. However, within 4 months of discontinuing treatment an abscess and draining fistulous tracts developed in the left axillary region. Two surgical fistulectomies and additional penicillin therapy were required to cure this animal. These cases and the current veterinary and human literature on actinomycosis are used to propose a rational approach to the treatment of actinomycosis in the dog.
TI  - Human salivary acidic proline-rich proteins and statherin promote the attachment  of Actinomyces viscosus LY7 to apatitic surfaces.
AB  - Actinomyces viscosus LY7 cells adsorbed in high numbers to experimental pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite (HA) from human parotid or submandibular saliva but not to pellicles prepared from human plasma or serum. To determine the nature of the salivary components responsible for promoting adhesion, pellicles were prepared from fractions of submandibular and parotid saliva obtained by chromatography on Trisacryl GF 2000 columns. Adsorption of LY7 cells was promoted by two groups of fractions. Each group was rechromatographed on DEAE-agarose. Fractions which promoted adsorption of LY7 cells were found by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to contain the acidic proline-rich proteins (PRPs) and statherin. Pellicles prepared from 12-micrograms/ml solutions of pure PRP-1, PRP-2, or parotid isoelectric focusing (PIF-slow) variant promoted maximal adsorption of A. viscosus LY7 cells. Somewhat higher concentrations of PRP-3 and PRP-4 were required for maximal adsorption, indicating that the 44-residue carboxy-terminal segment of PRP-1, PRP-2, and PIF-slow enhances LY7 binding but is not essential. Much higher concentrations of statherin were required to promote LY7 adsorption. Adsorption of LY7 cells to pellicles prepared from PRP-1 was not affected over the range of pH 5 to 8. Adsorption was also not inhibited by 50 mM lactose, which is consistent with the notion that type 1 fimbriae, rather than type 2 fimbriae, were responsible. A. viscosus T14, Actinomyces odontolyticus ATCC 17982, and Actinomyces israelii 12597 also adsorbed to PRP-1 pellicles, whereas Actinomyces naeslundii ATCC 12104 did not. Although A. viscosus cells bind strongly to adsorbed PRP-1, the presence of PRP-1 or PRP-3 in solution did not inhibit adhesion. Similarly, [3H]PRP-1 did not bind to LY7 cells, nor was it degraded when incubated with the organism. However, LY7 cells adsorbed to [3H]PRP-1 pellicles. These data suggest that hidden molecular segments of PRP become exposed when the protein adsorbs to HA; these segments then react with adhesins of LY7 cells. The apparent ability of A. viscosus cells to recognize segments of PRPs which are exposed only in surface-adsorbed molecules provides a novel mechanism which enables the organism to attach to teeth when suspended in salivary secretions.
TI  - The synergistic effect of cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The synergistic interaction of cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime against 187 clinically significant anaerobic organisms was investigated. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces odontolyticus, propionibacteria, lactobacilli, peptostreptococci, Streptococcus intermedius and Veillonella were sensitive to cefotaxime. Both Eubacterium lentum and Streptococcus morbillorum were resistant. The susceptibility of the clostridia varied from 0.125 to greater than 256 mg/L; only 20% of species demonstrated synergy between cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefotaxime against members of the genus Bacteroides ranged from 0.0625 to greater than 256 mg/L. The MIC50 of cefotaxime to Bacteroides fragilis and B. vulgatus was lowered from 6 and 4 mg/L, respectively, to 2 and 1 mg/L, respectively, when 4 mg/L desacetylcefotaxime was added to the medium. Full or partial synergy was demonstrated by 50.7% of the Bacteroides species tested. While cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime act synergistically against many members of the genus Bacteroides, the MIC of at least 10% of strains is not affected by this combination.
TI  - Early microbial colonization of permucosal implants in edentulous patients.
AB  - In edentulous patients, the microbial colonization of permucosal implants of sintered hydroxyapatite was studied. Samples were taken from mucosa and dentures before insertion of implants and from supra- and subgingival sites two to 10 weeks after insertion. In total, five patients and 10 implants with clinically healthy peri-implant tissues were studied. The samples were investigated by dark-field microscopy and anaerobic culture. The supragingival plaque of the implants was dominated by Gram-positive cocci and rods, the subgingival plaque by Haemophilus spp. and Veillonella parvula. A group of bacteria was found specifically related to the implants: Actinomyces odontolyticus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, Capnocytophaga sputigena, and Leptotrichia buccalis. Black-pigmented Bacteroides was not found in any of the examined samples. Spirochetes were observed in denture plaque samples and in supragingival plaque of the implants. It is concluded that bacteria known as potential periodontal pathogens colonize the permucosal implants in the first weeks after insertion. The presence of these species seems to be dependent on the ecological factors provided by the artificial gingival crevice of the permucosal implants in the edentulous mouth.
TI  - Intergeneric bacterial coaggregations involving mutans streptococci and oral actinomyces.
AB  - Mutans streptococci (MS) representing eight different serotypes were tested for their ability to coaggregate in vitro with oral actinomyces and other streptococcal species. Of the mutans streptococci tested, only strains of S. cricetus (formerly S. mutans serotype a) displayed pronounced coaggregations and only with certain strains of actinomyces. S. cricetus coaggregated, by lactose nonreversible mechanisms, with serotype 4 Actinomyces naeslundii WVU963 and WVU924 and with serotype 2 Actinomyces odontolyticus WVU758. The first pair was disaggregated by protein denaturants (e.g., sodium dodecyl sulfate and urea) and EDTA. This coaggregation was inhibited when the streptococcal, but not the actinomyces, partner was pretreated with either heat or protease, suggesting the presence of a protein mediator on only the streptococcal cell surface. The S. cricetus-A. odontolyticus coaggregation appeared to involve protein components on each cell, as shown by the lack of coaggregation after pretreatment of either cell type with heat or proteases. This coaggregation was also reversed by sodium dodecyl sulfate and urea, as well as by sodium deoxycholate, but not by EDTA. The data indicate that different mechanisms may be involved in each of these coaggregations.
TI  - Keratinolytic activity of cutaneous and oral bacteria.
AB  - A test was developed to measure the keratinolytic activity of cutaneous and oral  bacteria. Keratin, labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate, was used in a phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) with 1 mM dithiothreitol. The degradation of keratin was estimated by measuring the fluorescence of the degradation products in the supernatant of the reaction mixtures in a luminescence spectrometer. Several oral and cutaneous bacteria were investigated: Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Treponema denticola, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Brevibacterium epidermidis, Brevibacterium lines, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Corynebacterium minutissimum, Corynebacterium ovis, and Rhodococcus equi. The dermatophyte Trichophyton rubrum was used as a control organism. The test offered a simple and quantitative method for the estimation of keratin degradation and enabled us to show keratinolytic activity in Trichophyton rubrum, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, B. linens, B. epidermidis, Bacteroides gingivalis, and Treponema denticola. The keratinolytic activity was cell bound and heat sensitive. The presence of dithiothreitol stimulated the degradation of keratin to mainly high-molecular-weight products.
TI  - Actinomyces odontolyticus infections: review of six patients.
AB  
TI  - Bacterial profiles of subgingival plaques in periodontitis.
AB  - In this report over 400 subgingival plaque samples taken from over 110 patients were examined microscopically and culturally for 30 bacterial parameters. The patients could be placed into six disease categories based upon clinical criteria. The bacterial profile of each clinical category was generally distinctive of that category. Periodontal patients who had been successfully treated and maintained had plaques that were populated by significantly higher proportions of Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, A. odontolyticus and S. mutans and significantly lower proportions of B. gingivalis and spirochetes compared to the five untreated disease categories. The spirochetes were the overwhelming microbial type in the plaques of adult periodontitis (AP) patients, averaging about 45% of the microscopic count. The bacteriological results could not distinguish between ADA Type III and IV periodontitis, suggesting that the same type of infection was occurring in an active site in any AP patient. The patients designated as early onset periodontitis (EOP) differed from the other patients by their relative youth and by their significantly higher proportions of Bacteroides gingivalis and/or B. intermedius. Two types of EOP were recognized in which the most diseased variant was characterized by having an average of 49% spirochetes in the plaque. Four localized juvenile periodontitis (LJP) patients were notable in not having detectable A. actinomycetemcomitans. The data indicate that the various types of periodontitis, with the possible exception of LJP are specific anaerobic infections involving spirochetes and to a lesser extent B. gingivalis and B. intermedius.
TI  - Enterocutaneous fistulization due to Actinomyces odontolyticus. Report of a case.
AB  - A case of abdominal actinomycosis originating from the sigmoid colon is presented. Actinomyces odontolyticus was isolated; it is a rarity, but should be suspected in the case of a palpable mass and several fistulas developing after a latent period of weeks to months following surgical or inflammatory trauma. The diagnosis is made by anaerobic cultivation. Primary treatment with large doses of penicillin for several weeks may be supplemented by surgery. The strain isolated in the present case was only moderately sensitive to penicillin and was successfully treated with erythromycin.
TI  - Coaggregation of oral Bacteroides species with other bacteria: central role in coaggregation bridges and competitions.
AB  - Seventy-three freshly isolated oral strains representing 10 Bacteroides spp. were tested for their ability to coaggregate with other oral gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. None coaggregated with any of the gram-negative strains tested, which included Capnocytophaga gingivalis, C. ochracea, C. sputigena, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Strains of Bacteroides buccae, B. melaninogenicus, B. oralis, and B. gingivalis failed to coaggregate with any of the gram-positive strains tested. However, six Bacteroides spp. coaggregated with one or more species of gram-positive bacteria. Most isolates of B. buccalis, B. denticola, B. intermedius, B. loescheii, B. oris, and B. veroralis coaggregated with strains of Actinomyces israelii, A. viscosus, A. naeslundii, A. odontolyticus, Rothia dentocariosa, or Streptococcus sanguis. The strongest coaggregations involved B. denticola, B. loescheii, or B. oris; 22 of 25 strains coaggregated with A. israelii. Only B. loescheii interacted with certain strains of S. sanguis; these coaggregations were lactose inhibitable and were like coaggregations between A. viscosus and the same strains of S. sanguis. In fact, B. loescheii and A. viscosus were competitors for binding to S. sanguis. Many bacteroides also acted as coaggregation bridges by mediating coaggregations between two noncoaggregating cell types (e.g., S. sanguis and A. israelii). Evidence for binding-site competition and coaggregation bridging involving noncoaggregating cell types from three different genera provides support for the hypothesis that these intergeneric cell-to-cell interactions have an active role in bacterial colonization of the oral cavity.
TI  - Immunocytochemical demonstration of Actinomyces species and Arachnia propionica in periapical infections.
AB  - Immunocytochemical methods were used for the demonstration of Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces naeslundii and Arachnia propionica in bacterial colonies found in 7 routine biopsies from periapical inflammatory lesions. All 3 species were found in one specimen, both A. israelii and A. propionica in 3 specimens, and one of each species in the remaining 3 biopsies. Specificity controls by enzyme immunoassay showed that antiserum to A. israelii reacted also with A. odontolyticus, and that to A. naeslundii with A. viscosus, while antiserum to A. propionica did not show any cross-reactions with Actinomyces species. The results indicate that immunocytochemical methods can be used for the diagnosis of periapical actinomycosis at the species level. Actinomyces and Arachnia species seem to have an important role in the pathogenesis of complicated periapical infections.
TI  - The comparative cariogenicity and plaque-forming ability in vivo of four species  of the bacterium Actinomyces in gnotobiotic rats.
AB  - Gnotobiotic WAG/RIJ rats on a high sucrose diet were monoinfected with 12 strains of Actinomyces spp. Moderate levels of caries were induced by a single strain of Actinomyces naeslundii and low levels by two strains of Actinomyces viscosus, three strains of A. naeslundii and one strain of Actinomyces israelii. No caries was induced by single strains of A. viscosus and A. israelii or by three Actinomyces odontolyticus strains. Only fissure caries was observed. Scanning electron microscopy showed that all strains colonized the fissures and most colonized the lingual surface of the teeth, but to a limited extent. Production of abundant and dense plaque was not always accompanied by caries.
TI  - Inhibition of [3H]-thymidine uptake in human gingival fibroblasts by extracts from human dental plaque, oral bacteria of the Streptococcus and Actinomyces species.
AB  - Extracts from human dental plaque, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces israelli and Actinomyces odontolyticus inhibited [3H]-thymidine uptake by primary human gingival fibroblast cell lines as previous work has shown in respect of HeLa cells. The results show that a variety of oral bacteria, not usually considered to be periodontal pathogens, elaborate factors that adversely affect fibroblasts.
TI  - Actinomyces odontolyticus isolated from the female genital tract.
AB  - Actinomyces odontolyticus was isolated from genital tract specimens from 4.8% of  561 women fitted with intrauterine contraceptive devices and from 4% of 101 women with pelvic inflammatory disease and 1.8% of 525 women without pelvic inflammatory disease who were not known to be intrauterine contraceptive device wearers. The strains were isolated by prolonged anaerobic incubation of blood agar, with or without added 5% metronidazole or 1% neomycin. A odontolyticus has not been previously reported in cervico-vaginal specimens, and possible reasons for this are discussed.
TI  - Development and evaluation of a coculture technique for identification of anaerobic organisms.
AB  - We investigated a method to reduce oxygen tension and produce anaerobic conditions conveniently by coculture with a nonfermentative organism. The biochemical reactions of 94 strains representing 41 different species were determined using prereduced media and gas chromatography according to standard methods. The standard reactions were compared with those obtained by preparing similar media, modified by containing no cysteine or resazurin, under aerobic conditions. Preincubation of the modified biochemical media with a standard suspension of a culture of Acinetobacter lwoffi provided reducing conditions. In 1,449 individual tests using 22 different biochemicals, 1,349 (93%) of the reactions agreed. Only two misidentifications resulted when using the modified media, one each at the species and genus levels. Two strains of Actinomyces odontolyticus failed to grow in coculture.
TI  - [Pathogenic role of Actinomyces apart from actinomycosis. Apropos of 2 cases of acute suppurations with Actinomyces odontolyticus].
AB  - The authors report two cases of acute suppurative lesions due to Actinomyces odontolyticus. They point out the fairly high incidence of this pathogen in such conditions, either isolated or more often as part of a mixed flora. Conversely, Actinomyces odontolyticus is only exceptionally recovered in true actinomycosis.
TI  - Predominant cultivable microflora of plaque on removable dentures in patients with healthy oral mucosa.
AB  - Plaque from the fitting surface of upper full dentures in eight patients with healthy palatal mucosa was studied. To characterize the predominant cultivable flora, 916 isolates (100-128 from each sample) were subcultured from anaerobic roll-tubes. Streptococci constituted 0-81 per cent (median, 41 per cent) of the isolates with varying proportions of Streptococcus milleri, Streptoccus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitior and Streptococcus sanguis. Staphylococcus aureus made up 0-13 per cent (median, 6 per cent). Gram-positive rods constituted 1-74 per cent (median, 33 per cent). Among these, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces odontolyticus were the most common species, whereas lactobacilli were isolated only from two samples, constituting 21 and 48 per cent. Among Gram-negative bacteria, only Veillonella parvula was common, constituting 3-20 per cent (median, 10 per cent). Gram-negative rods were isolated only from three samples in small proportions making up 0-6 per cent (median, 0 per cent) of the flora. Forty-seven isolates (5 per cent) were lost. Cultures for yeasts on Sabouraud agar were positive for five samples and the yeast counts corresponded to 0-0.45 per cent (median, 0.002 per cent) of the total viable counts. The microflora of denture plaque is highly variable and is to a large extent similar to that of some forms of dental plaque.
TI  - Comparative pathogenicity of Actinomyces species in mice.
AB  - The comparative pathogenicity of different species of Actinomyces was studied in  a susceptible weanling-mouse model. After the intraperitoneal injection of strains of Actinomyces israeli, A. naeslundi, A. viscosus and Arachnia propionica, numerous abscesses developed in the intestine, mesentery, liver, and at the site of injection. Lesions were not produced by A. odontolyticus. A. naeslundi and A. viscosus produced acute lesions that resolved after a few weeks. Abscesses produced by rough strains of A. israeli and Arach. propionica persisted and led to a slowly progressive chronic infection. Viable organisms were always recovered from the lesions. Spread of the lesions by extension into other areas, including the thoracic cavity, led to the death of the animal after approximately 1 year. This study demonstrated a clear difference in the pattern of infection produced by the different species of Actinomyces as well as Arach. propionica.
TI  - Bacteriology of experimental gingivitis in young adult humans.
AB  - From replicate trials of experimental gingivitis in four periodontally healthy subjects, 166 bacterial species and subspecies were detected among 3,034 randomly selected isolates from 96 samples. Of these bacteria, Actinomyces naeslundii (serotype III and phenotypically similar strains that were unreactive with available antisera), Actinomyces odontolyticus (serotype I and phenotypically similar strains that were unreactive with available antisera), Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus species D-2, Streptococcus anginosus, Veillonella parvula, and Treponema species A appeared to be the most likely etiological agents of gingivitis. Statistical interpretations indicated that the greatest source of microbiological variation of the total flora observed was person-to-person differences in the floras. The next greatest source of variation was the inflammatory status of the sample sites. Person-to-person differences were smallest at experimental day 4. The floras became more diverse with time and as gingivitis developed and progressed. Analyses indicated that sequential colonization by certain species was repeatable and therefore probably predictable. Variation was relatively small between replicate trials, between two sites on the same teeth sampled on the same day, and between the same sites sampled at the same relative time in a replicate trial.
TI  - [Fusobacterium necrophorum associated with Actinomyces odontolyticus septicemia ].
AB  - The authors have observed a case of Fusobacterium necrophorum associate with Actinomyces odontolyticus septicemia, which appears to be the first case reported. In a 19 year old man, 15 blood cultures allowed to isolate both germs. Clinical manifestations were: acute-like abdomen, encephalitis, myocarditis and pleural effusion. Treatment with amoxicillin and metronidazole was successful.
TI  - Plasmid content of some oral microorganisms isolated from subgingival plaque.
AB  - Eighty-five strains of bacterial species selected from the predominant cultivable dental plaque flora of patients with different periodontal pathologies were examined for their plasmid content. Microorganisms studied included: Actinomyces viscosus, A. odontolyticus, Bacteroides asaccharolyticus (B. gingivalis), B. melaninogenicus subspecies intermedius, and subspecies melaninogenicus, Capnocytophaga ochracea (B. ochraceus), and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Three B. melaninogenicus isolates showed plasmids of approximately 2.7-2.9 Mdalton (mega-dalton) molecular size. Restriction enzyme digests of the plasmids demonstrated dissimilar patterns when electrophoresed on agarose gels. In other microorganisms, including the Actinomyces species, plasmids were not observed.
TI  - Hepatic actinomycosis presenting as repeated cholestatic reactions.
AB  - A patient with hepatic actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces odontolyticus is presented. The clinical course was characterized by 2 yr of episodic abdominal pains and fever together with marked acute elevations of serum alkaline phosphatase. The diagnosis escaped extensive laboratory studies, 2 liver biopsies and 1 laparotomy and was finally verified at a second laparotomy by histology and a positive culture. Histopathology showed multiple small abscesses. No primary focus of infection was found. Treatment with doxycycline was successful.
TI  - Actinomyces of infected dental root canals.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to identity Actinomyces occurring in infected dental root canals. Out of twenty-five isolated Actinomyces strains, four were A. israelii, four were A. naeslundii, four were A. odontolyticus, and six were A. viscosus. Seven strains could be identified only as Actinomyces spp. The relative frequency of various species of Actinomyces isolated from root canals was similar to that of carious dentin. The Actinomyces strains were usually part of polymicrobial infections. These infections could usually be eliminated by one or two conventional endodontic treatments. In two cases, however, A. israelii was repeatedly isolated in pure culture from the root canals. These two infections had to be eliminated by means of periapical surgery.
TI  - Lipoquinones of some spore-forming rods, lactic-acid bacteria and actinomycetes.
AB  - The respiratory quinones of 73 strains of Gram-positive bacteria including spore-forming rods, lactic-acid bacteria and actinomyctes were examined. Menaquinones with seven isoprenoid units (MK-7) were the main quinone type found in representatives of the genus Bacillus and in Sporolactobacillus inulinus. However, a strain of B. thuringiensis produced MK-8 in addition to MK-7, and strains of B. lentus and B. pantothenticus appeared to produce MK-9 and MK-8, respectively, with no MK-7. In the clostridia and lactic-acid bacteria, no quinones were found, except in Pediococcus cerevisiae NCTC 8066 and Lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus ATCC 7469, which contained menaquinones, and Streptococcus faecalis NCTC 775 and HIM 478-1, which contained demethylmenaquinones, in relatively low concentrations. Menaquinones were also found in the actinomycetes (except Actinomyces odontolyticus and Bifidobacterium bifidum which did not produce any quinones) and in Protaminobacter alboflavus ATCC 8458, the so-called Actinobacillus actinoides ATCC 15900 and Noguchia granulosis NCTC 10559.
TI  - Actinomycotic pulmonary abscess in an immunosuppressed patient.
AB  - The clinical history of a patient with rheumatoid arthritis and bacteriologic findings from a pulmonary abscess occurring during prednisone therapy are presented. Direct transthoracic aspiration of the lesion yielded a pure culture of Actinomyces odontolyticus. This is believed to be the first case of a deep visceral infection with this organism, an inhabitant of the normal mouth and gums. Immunosuppression of the host probably played a role in establishment of the infection.
TI  - Subgingival microflora of periodontal patients on tetracycline therapy.
AB  - Samples of subgingival plaque were collected from periodontal patients receiving  two different tetracycline treatment regimens following conventional periodontal therapy. Four patients had received an oral dose of 1000 mg/day for 2 weeks and nine had received 1000 mg/day for 1 week followed by 250 mg/day for extended time periods. The latter regimen is similar so that commonly prescribed for the chronic skin disease, acne vulgaris. Taxonomic characterization of plaque isolates indicated that the predominant organisms cultured from both treatment groups were species of Streptococcus and the branching, filamentous Gram-positive rods, Actinomyces and Rothia. A much greater microbial complexity was observed among the flora isolated from patients taking 250 mg/day. The latter group harbored many of the fastidious Gram-negative organisms presently implicated in the etiology of periodontal disease. All bacterial strains isolated were tested for resistance to tetracycline by replica-plating cultures on an agar medium containing two-fold dilutions of the antibiotic. Streptococcus, Veillonella and Neisseria were the bacterial genera found to be consistently resistant to tetracycline, with minimum inhibitory concentrations as high as 128 micrograms/ml. Among the Actinomyces, selection for antibiotic resistance was common only within a single species, A. odontolyticus. However, A viscosus strains isolated at 54% of the subgingival flora from one patient did demonstrate an intermediate resistance level, growing on concentrations up to 8 micrograms/ml. Tetracycline resistance was shown by a variety of Gram-negative rods isolated from the low dosage group. Although a minimum number of patients were studied, extensive microbial analyses of the predominating subgingival bacteria indicated that the goal of tetracycline therapy was achieved during the 2-week therapy period at 1000 mg/day.
TI  - [Actinomyces odontolyticus, first study in France].
AB  - The authors report the detailed study of a strain of Actinomyces odontolyticus isolated from a pleural liquid. Gas-liquid chromatography can specify the biochemistral metabolism of the germ and set off an endocellular lipidolytic activity.
TI  - Bacteriocin from Actinomyces odontolyticus with temperature-dependent killing properties.
AB  - A strain of Actinomyces odontolyticus, originally isolated from human dental plaque, produced a non-dialyzable, trypsin-sensitive substance that was bactericidal for certain strains of bifidobacteria at 42 degrees C but not at 37 degrees C. Detectable quantities of the bacteriocin were not produced in liquid media. Experimentally useful yields were obtained by extraction from pour plate cultures of producer cells. At 42 degrees C, exponential killing did not occur until indicator cells had doubled at least once. At 37 degrees C, the bacteriocin effected a transient bacteriostasis. Partially purified concentrates were obtained by diethylaminoethyl-cellulose chromatography, and such material was not inactivated by ribonuclease, deoxyribonuclease, or lipase. Pronase, trypsin, and exposure to 100 degrees C for 20 min completely abolished activity. Inhibitory activity was considerably reduced by exposure to a pH of either 3 or 11. Treatment of producer cells with curing agents did not induce a high frequency of non-bacteriocinogenic cells. The odontolyticin was adsorbed by susceptible, as well as resistant, bacteria.
TI  - Malar mass due to Actinomyces odontolyticus.
AB  - Actinomyces odontolyticus was isolated from a patient with a soft tissue mass in  the malar region. The organism was identified on the basis of morphological, cultural, and biochemical characteristics. On histological examination, the tissue mass contained several granulomatous foci with small, basophilic staining areas resembling microscopic sulfur granules. This is believed to be the first reported case of actinomycosis due to A. odontolyticus.
TI  - Serological identification of Actinomyces using fluorescent antibody techniques.
AB  - Species-specific FITC conjugated antiserum can be prepared for each of the five species of Actinomyces and for Arachnia propionica. These serums can be used for rapid and specific identification of pure or mixed cultures of the bacteria and for identification of organisms seen in direct smears of clinical material or in tissue sections. Two serotypes each of A bovis, A odontolyticus, A israelii, A viscosus, and A propionica have been established, and A naeslundii has been tentatively divided into four serotypes.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy and laboratory identification of Actinomyces and Arachnia and  some related bacteria.
AB  - A numerical taxonomic study was made on 49 facultative anaerobic Gram-positive filamentous and/or diphtheroidal organisms isolated from dental plaques, carious dentin and faeces, together with 63 reference strains belonging to the genera Actinomyces, Arachnia, Bifidobacterium, Actinobacterium, Propionibacterium, Eubacterium and Lactobacillus. They were examined for 90 unit characters covering a wide range of tests and properties. The data were subjected to computer analysis in which the simple matching coefficient (SSM) and the similarity index (SJ) were calculated, and the results of single linkage techniques and an unweighted average linkage cluster analysis technique were compared. The strains fell into six major groups (phena). The Actinomyces strains were recovered in two phena; the first contained Actinomyces israelii and the other facultative anaerobic Actinomyces, including subclusters equal to taxospecies of A. odontolyticus and A. viscosus/A. naeslundii, while the other phenon corresponded to the genera Arachnia, Actinobacterium, Bifidobacterium and Propionibacterium. The groups of Arachnia and Actinobacterium each contained one species, representing taxospecies of Arachnia propionica and Actinobacterium meyerii. Taxonomic criteria, both constant and discriminative, were selected to form a diagnostic table useful for laboratory identification of this group of organisms. Immunofluorescence supported the numerical data.
