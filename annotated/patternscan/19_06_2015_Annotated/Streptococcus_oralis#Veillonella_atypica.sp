TI  == development and pyrosequencing analysis of an in-vitro oral biofilm model.
AB  == background: dental caries and periodontal disease are the commonest bacterial diseases of man and can result in tooth loss. the principal method of prevention  is the mechanical removal of dental plaque augmented by active agents incorporated into toothpastes and mouthrinses. in-vitro assays that include complex oral bacterial biofilms are required to accurately predict the efficacy of novel active agents in vivo. the aim of this study was to develop an oral biofilm model using the calgary biofilm device (cbd) seeded with a natural saliva inoculum and analysed by next generation sequencing. the specific objectives were to determine the reproducibility and stability of the model by comparing the composition of the biofilms over time derived from (i) the same volunteers at different time points, and (ii) different panels of volunteers. results: pyrosequencing yielded 280,093 sequences with a mean length of 432 bases after filtering. a mean of 320 and 250 otus were detected in pooled saliva and biofilm  samples, respectively. principal coordinates analysis (pcoa) plots based on community membership and structure showed that replicate biofilm samples were highly similar and clustered together. in addition, there were no significant differences between biofilms derived from the same panel at different times using analysis of molecular variance (amova). there were significant differences between biofilms from different panels (amova, p < 0.002). pcoa revealed that there was a shift in biofilm composition between seven and 14 days (amova, p < 0.001). veillonella parvula, veillonella atypica/dispar/parvula and peptostreptococcus stomatis were the predominant otus detected in seven-day biofilms, whilst prevotella oralis, v. parvula and streptococcus constellatus were predominant in 14-day biofilms. conclusions: diverse oral biofilms were successfully grown and maintained using the cbd. biofilms derived from the same panel of volunteers were highly reproducible. this model could be used to screen  both antimicrobial-containing oral care products and also novel approaches aiming to modify plaque composition, such as pre- or probiotics.

TI  == a yada-like autotransporter, hag1 in veillonella atypica is a multivalent hemagglutinin involved in adherence to oral streptococci, porphyromonas gingivalis, and human oral buccal cells.
AB  == dental biofilm development is a sequential process, and adherence between microbes and the salivary pellicle (adhesion) as well as among different microbes (co-adhesion or coaggregation) plays a critical role in building a biofilm community. the veillonella species are among the most predominant species in the  oral cavity and coaggregate with many initial, early, middle, and late colonizers. similar to oral fusobacteria, they are also considered bridging species in biofilm development. however, the mechanism of this ability has yet to be reported, due to the previous lack of a genetic transformation system in the entire genus. in this study, we used our recently discovered transformable veillonella strain, veillonella atypica ok5, to probe the mechanism of coaggregation between veillonella species and other oral bacteria. by insertional inactivation of all eight putative hemagglutinin genes, we identified one gene, hag1, which is involved in v. atypica coaggregation with the initial colonizers streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus cristatus, and the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis. the hag1 mutant also abolished adherence to human buccal cells. inhibition assays using various chemical or physiological treatments suggest different mechanisms being involved in coaggregation with different partners. the entire hag1 gene was sequenced and shown to be the largest known bacterial hemagglutinin gene.

TI  == isolation and characterization of coaggregation-defective (cog-) mutants of streptococcus gordonii dl1 (challis).
AB  == streptococcus gordonii dl1 (challis) bears coaggregation-mediating surface adhesins which recognize galactoside-containing surface polysaccharides on streptococcus oralis 34, streptococcus oralis c104, and streptococcus sm pk509. fifty-nine spontaneously-occurring coaggregation-defective (cog-) mutants of s. gordonii dl1 unable to coaggregate with partner streptococci were isolated. six representative cog- mutants were characterized by their coaggregation properties  with four actinomyces naeslundii strains (t14v, pk947, pk606, pk984), veillonella atypica pk1910, and propionibacterium acnes pk93. the six representative cog- mutants showed altered coaggregation with their streptococcal partners, a. naeslundii pk947, and p. acnes pk93. based on the coaggregation phenotypes of these mutants, a model for the lactose-inhibitable coaggregation between s. gordonii dl1 and its partner bacteria is proposed. the potential use of these mutants in studies of oral biofilms is discussed.
