TI  == dextrans produced by lactic acid bacteria exhibit antiviral and immunomodulatory  activity against salmonid viruses.
AB  == viral infections in the aquaculture of salmonids can lead to high mortality and substantial economic losses. thus, there is industrial interest in new molecules  active against these viruses. here we describe the production, purification, and  the physicochemical and structural characterization of high molecular weight dextrans synthesized by lactobacillus sakei mn1 and leuconostoc mesenteroides rtf10. the purified dextrans, and commercial dextrans with molecular weights ranging from 10 to 2000kda, were assayed in infected bf-2 and epc fish cell-line  monolayers for antiviral activity. only t2000 and dextrans from mn1 and rtf10 had significant antiviral activity. this was similar to results obtained against infectious pancreatic necrosis virus. however the dextran from mn1 showed ten-fold higher activity against hematopoietic necrosis virus than t2000. in vivo assays using the mn1 polymer confirmed the in vitro results and revealed immunomodulatory activity. these results together with the high levels of dextran production (2gl(-1)) by lb. sakei mn1, indicate the compounds potential utility as an antiviral agent in aquaculture.

TI  == in vitro protective effect of lactic acid bacteria on listeria monocytogenes adhesion and invasion of caco-2 cells.
AB  == the adhesion of listeria monocytogenes to intestinal endothelial cells is a crucial step in the infection process, which is not well understood. in this study, we evaluated the potential ability of bacteriocin-producing enterococcus faecium, leuconostoc mesenteroides and lactobacillus sakei strains to prevent the adhesion and invasion of eukaryotic cells by ten different l. monocytogenes isolates. the results showed that e. faecium 130 co-cultured with l. monocytogenes was the most effective in preventing infection of caco-2 cells, as  the vast majority of isolates showed significantly lower adhesion counts and invasion rates below the quantification limit of the method (<30 cfu/plate). l. sakei 1 was the least effective strain in preventing l. monocytogenes infection;  only one isolate presented a lower adhesion rate and two isolates reduced the invasion rate of caco-2 cells. fluorescence in situ hybridisation (fish) assay was shown to be an effective tool to illustrate and identify species in co-culture with l. monocytogenes during the adhesion process to caco-2 cells.

TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of microbiota reveals that lactic acid bacteria are dominant in korean flat fish fermented food, gajami-sikhae.
AB  == the gajami-sikhae, traditional korean cuisine fermented with flat fish, samples were collected from eight different manufacturers (gs1-gs8). we employed pyrosequencing method to analyze the bacterial communities of the gajami-sikhae samples. family- and genus-level analyses indicated that the bacterial community  compositions of gs3 and gs6 were distinct from those of the rest. the species-level structures of bacterial communities of the gajami-sikhae samples except for gs3 and gs6 featured lactobacillus sakei as the most abundant species. leuconostoc mesenteroides was revealed as the most dominant species among the bacterial community of gs6 and the bacterial community of gs3 was composed of various lactic acid bacteria. we employed a culture-based method to isolate beneficial strains from the gajami-sikhae samples. however, most of the 47 selected colonies were identified as bacillus subtilis and bacillus amyloliquefaciens. this study indicated that gajami-sikhae was mainly composed of many beneficial lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == lactic acid bacterial population dynamics during fermentation and storage of thai fermented sausage according to restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.
AB  == this study applied restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis to identify the lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from "mum" thai fermented sausages during fermentation and storage. a total of 630 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from the sausages prepared using 2 methods. in method 1, after stuffing, the sausages were stored at 30 degrees c for 14 days. in method 2, after stuffing and storage at 30 degrees c for 3 days, the sausages were vacuum-packed and stored at 4 degrees c until day 28. the sausages were sampled on days 0, 3, 14, and 28 for analyses. the 16s rdna was amplified and digested using restriction enzymes. of the restriction enzymes evaluated, dde i displayed  the highest discrimination capacity. the lab were classified and 7 species were identified for methods 1 and 2, during fermentation, the lactobacillus sakei and  lactobacillus plantarum species were dominant. for method 2, the proportion of leuconostoc mesenteroides markedly increased during storage, until l. sakei and ln. mesenteroides represented the dominant species. the identification of lab in  the sausage samples could facilitate the selection of appropriate microorganisms  for candidate starter cultures for future controlled mum production.

TI  == application' and validation of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria starter cultures for controlled leek fermentations and their influence on the antioxidant properties of leek.
AB  == leek (allium ampeloprasum var. porrum) is one of belgium's most important outdoor vegetables, mainly cultivated for its white shaft. fermentation of leek offers opportunities in view of biomass valorization and product diversification. this study deals with the implementation and validation of starter cultures to perform controlled leek fermentations and to ensure a high quality of the end-products. therefore, a thorough study of the fermentation microbiology and the influence of three starter culture strains (lactobacillus plantarum imdo 788, lactobacillus sakei imdo 1358, and leuconostoc mesenteroides imdo 1347) on the metabolite kinetics of leek fermentation and antioxidant properties of leek was performed. overall, the application of lactic acid bacteria starter cultures resulted in a fast prevalence of the species involved, coupled to an accelerated acidification. of the three starter cultures tested, the mixed starter culture of l. plantarum imdo 788 and l. mesenteroides imdo 1347 was most promising, as its application resulted in fermented leek of good microbiological quality and in a more extensive carbohydrate consumption, whereby diverse end-metabolites were produced. however, high residual fructose concentrations allowed yeast outgrowth, resulting in increased ethanol and glycerol concentrations, and indicated the lack of a prevailing strictly heterofermentative lab species. the antioxidant capacity of fermented leek samples, as measured with the oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay, increased when starter cultures were used, whereas with regard to 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical scavenging activity, only leek fermented with l. sakei imdo 1358 scored higher than spontaneously fermented leek. the total phenolic content was not influenced by the use of starter cultures, while the s-alk(en)yl-l-cysteine sulfoxides content decreased strongly. a preliminary sensory analysis revealed that the spontaneously fermented leek and the one obtained with the mixed starter culture were preferred by consumers, emphasizing again the importance of microbial successions in vegetable fermentations.

TI  == metatranscriptomic analysis of lactic acid bacterial gene expression during kimchi fermentation.
AB  == barcode-based 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing showed that the kimchi microbiome was  dominated by six lactic acid bacteria (lab), leuconostoc (lc.) mesenteroides, lactobacillus (lb.) sakei, weissella (w.) koreensis, lc. gelidum, lc. carnosum, and lc. gasicomitatum. therefore, we used completed genome sequences of representatives of these bacteria to investigate metatranscriptomic gene-expression profiles during kimchi fermentation. total mrna was extracted from kimchi samples taken at five time points during a 29 day-fermentation. nearly all (97.7%) of the metagenome sequences that were recruited on all lab genomes of genbank mapped onto the six lab strains; this high coverage rate indicated that this approach for assessing processes carried out by the kimchi microbiome was valid. expressed mrna sequences (as cdna) were determined using illumina ga iix. assignment of mrna sequences to metabolic genes using mg-rast revealed the prevalence of carbohydrate metabolism and lactic acid fermentation.  the mrna sequencing reads were mapped onto genomes of the six lab strains, which  showed that lc. mesenteroides was most active during the early-stage fermentation, whereas gene expression by lb. sakei and w. koreensis was high during later stages. however, gene expression by lb. sakei decreased rapidly at 25 days of fermentation, which was possibly caused by bacteriophage infection of  the lactobacillus species. many genes related to carbohydrate transport and hydrolysis and lactate fermentation were actively expressed, which indicated typical heterolactic acid fermentation. mannitol dehydrogenase-encoding genes (mdh) were identified from all leuconostoc species and especially lc. mesenteroides, which harbored three copies (two copies on chromosome and one copy on plasmid) of mdh with different expression patterns. these results contribute to knowledge of the active populations and gene expression in the lab community responsible for an important fermentation process.

TI  == species diversity, community dynamics, and metabolite kinetics of spontaneous leek fermentations.
AB  == leek (allium ampeloprasum var. porrum) is one of belgium's most important vegetables. all or part of the green leek parts are often left on the fields because of their limited cooking applications compared to the white leek parts. therefore, the possibility to perform leek fermentations in view of product valorization and diversification was investigated. this study deals with the community dynamics, species diversity, and metabolite kinetics of spontaneous leek fermentations, thereby studying the influence of added nacl concentration, harvesting season, and duration of the fermentation. the combination of a culture-dependent and culture-independent approach revealed the prevalence of lactic acid bacteria (lab) from the third day of fermentation onwards, which was  not influenced by the fermentation conditions applied. enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonadaceae, and yeasts disappeared after one week of fermentation. leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus sakei, and lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and lactobacillus parabrevis were the most frequently isolated lab species. both added nacl concentrations were suitable to perform successful fermentations within three weeks. by that time, glucose and fructose,  the main leek carbohydrates, were metabolized into mainly lactic acid, acetic acid, ethanol, and mannitol. a sensory analysis revealed that the fermented white leek parts were generally more appreciated than the fermented green leek parts.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from cheeses and yogurts.
AB  == the biopreservation of foods using bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated directly from foods is an innovative approach. the objectives of this study were to isolate and identify bacteriocinogenic lab from various cheeses and yogurts and evaluate their antimicrobial effects on selected spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in vitro as well as on a food commodity.lab were isolated using mrs and m17 media. the agar diffusion bioassay was used to screen  for bacteriocin or bacteriocin-like substances (bls) producing lab using lactobacillus sakei and listeria innocua as indicator organisms. out of 138 lab isolates, 28 were found to inhibit these bacteria and were identified as strains  of enterococcus faecium, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei using 16s rrna gene sequencing. eight isolates were tested for antimicrobial activity at 5 degrees c and 20 degrees c against l. innocua, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas fluorescens, erwinia carotovora, and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides using the agar diffusion bioassay, and also against penicillium expansum, botrytis cinerea and monilinia frucitcola using the microdilution plate method. the effect of selected lab strains on l. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions was also investigated.twenty percent of our isolates produced bls inhibiting the growth of l. innocua and/or lact. sakei. organic acids and/or h2o2 produced by lab and not  the bls had strong antimicrobial effects on all microorganisms tested with the exception of e. coli. ent. faecium, strep. thermophilus and lact. casei effectively inhibited the growth of natural microflora and l. innocua inoculated  onto fresh-cut onions. bacteriocinogenic lab present in cheeses and yogurts may have potential to be used as biopreservatives in foods.

TI  == anti-allergic effect of lactic acid bacteria isolated from seed mash used for brewing sake is not dependent on the total ige levels.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) in fermented foods have attracted considerable attention recently as treatment options for allergic diseases, the incidence of which has been increasing worldwide. five strains of lab isolated from kimoto, the traditional seed mash used for brewing sake, were screened for the ability to suppress ige-mediated hypersensitivity reaction. leuconostoc mesenteroides and lactobacillus sakei, the normal microflora in kimoto, significantly suppressed the reaction, but the contaminant lactobacillus curvatus did not. next, we examined the effect of l. sakei lk-117 on atopic dermatitis in the nc/nga mouse model. lk-117 supplementation significantly reduced the development of atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions in a manner independent of the ige plasma levels. in the in vitro intestinal model constructed using the human intestinal epithelial cell line caco-2 and murine macrophage cell line raw 264.7, treatment with l. sakei lk-117, but not l. curvatus, significantly upregulated tnf-alpha production from raw264.7 cells. this result indicated that l. sakei on the apical side affected the macrophages on the basolateral side, and this organism may have the  ability to improve allergy symptoms mediated by the intestinal immune system.

TI  == genotypic and phenotypic characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from italian ryegrass silage.
AB  == twenty-three lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from three cultivars (akiaoba, nagahahikari and tachiwase) of italian ryegrass (lolium multiflorum lam.) silage  were precisely characterized by a combination of phenotypic tests, genotypic 16s  ribosomal dna sequencing and rapid pcr-based analyses, focusing on their useful phenotypes for silage preparation as inoculants. we successfully identified both  at the species and subspecies levels: phenotypically novel lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus coryniformis subsp. torquens,  lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum, lactobacillus sakei subsp. carnosus, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum and pediococcus parvulus. this is the first report to elucidate the presence of lactobacillus coryniformis ssp. torquens and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum in italian ryegrass silages. physiological and biochemical tests revealed that phenotypic characteristics are different among the different strains of the same species and subspecies, and that the isolates show unique and diverse phenotypes related to fermentation factors, such as available carbohydrates, optimal growth ph and temperature. these results suggest that, for various well-preserved silage preparations, the isolates may be useful in producing novel inoculants corresponding to their optimally climatic and ecological niches.

TI  == isolation and characterisation of lactic acid bacteria from jiang-gua (fermented  cucumbers), a traditional fermented food in taiwan.
AB  == background: jiang-gua (fermented cucumbers) is a popular traditional fermented food in taiwan. the microflora of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in jiang-gua have not been investigated in detail. in this study, lab from jiang-gua were isolated, characterised and identified. results: a total of 103 lab were isolated; 70 cultures were isolated from jiang-gua samples and 33 cultures were isolated from  its raw substrate, cucumber. these isolates were mainly characterised phenotypically and then divided into seven groups (a-g) by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing of 16s ribosomal dna. the isolates were identified as enterococcus casseliflavus, leuconostoc lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paraplantarum, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, weissella cibaria and weissella  hellenica. the antibacterial activities of the isolates were determined and 11 lc. lactis subsp. lactis strains showed inhibitory activity against the indicator strain lactobacillus sakei jcm 1157(t) . conclusion: heterofermentative w. cibaria and leu. lactis were the major lab found in jiang-gua samples without soy sauce. in soy sauce-added samples, homofermentative l. pentosus and l. plantarum  were the most abundant lab. in addition, the results also suggested that hhai and rsai restriction enzymes could be applied to distinguish w. hellenica and weissella paramesenteroides.

TI  == combination of culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular methods for the determination of lactic microbiota in sucuk.
AB  == in this study, the culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular methods were used for the identification of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in sucuk a turkish fermented dry sausage. on the one hand, the pcr-dgge method targetting the v1 and v3 regions of 16s dna was applied to dna that was directly extracted from sucuk samples. on the other hand, rep-pcr fingerprinting was performed for the primary  differentiation and grouping of the isolates, and the results were confirmed by sequencing of the 16s rdna and 16s-23s rdna intergenic spacer region. as a result of the pcr-dgge analysis of all the samples, total 8 different lactic acid bacteria were identified, and lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus curvatus and weissella viridescens were the dominant microbiota among these bacteria. the culture-dependent approach indicated that the majority of the strains belonged to the lactobacillus genera including lb. sakei, lactobacillus plantarum, lb. curvatus, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus farciminis and lactobacillus alimentarius. however, leuconostoc and weisella were also detected as minor genera. again, lactococcus piscium, weissella halotolerans, staphylococcus succinus and the comigrated staphylococcus piscifermentans/staphylococcus condimenti/staphylococcus carnosus group were detected only with the culture-independent method while lb. plantarum, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc citreum were identified only by using the culture-dependent method. in the results, it was concluded that the combination of culture-dependent and culture-independent methods was necessary for reliable and detailed investigation of lab communities in fermented food products.

TI  == fingerprint of lactic acid bacteria population in beef carpaccio is influenced by storage process and seasonal changes.
AB  == we have investigated the population structure of lactic acid bacteria (lab) for several beef carpaccio available on the market with the purpose of comparing the  effect of storage process (modified-atmosphere packaging and vacuum-packaging) and of seasonal changes on this microbial population. out of 60 samples we have characterised 214 isolates accounting for 10 lab species and 35 isolates accounting for 11 non-lab species. lactobacillus sakei, leuconostoc carnosum and  leuconostoc mesenteroides were the most prevailing lab species with a frequency of identification within 66%, 62% and 52% of the samples respectively. these 3 species were also characterised by a phenotypic intra-species diversity of isolates based on colony morphology. we showed that the prevalence was increased  1.5 fold for l. sakei and l. mesenteroides during the summer sampling in comparison to the spring or the fall sampling suggesting an environmental origin  of these two species. seasonal variations were also observed for the prevalence of lactobacillus fuchuensis and l. carnosum in spring (2- and 1.5-fold increase,  respectively) and of brochothrix thermosphacta in fall (6-fold increase). finally, we demonstrated that the growth potential after the sell-by-date was favourable of 1.25 log(10) cfu g(-1) to leuconostoc spp. in modified-atmosphere packaging and of 1.38 log(10) cfu g(-1) to lactobacillus spp. in vacuum-packaging. in conclusion, we show that important and unsuspected traits in bacterial population dynamics can be unravelled by large sampling strategies. we  discuss about the need to take this assessment into account for further studies on bacterial ecosystems of meat.

TI  == identification of lactobacilli residing in chicken ceca with antagonism against campylobacter.
AB  == bacteriocins produced by lactobacillus salivarius have been recently recognized as a natural means to control campylobacter and salmonella in live poultry. this  finding is of relevance since campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli are the predominant species isolated from poultry that are associated with human campylobacteriosis. in the present work, lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from the cecum of twenty tunisian chickens were identified and those isolates with antagonism against campylobacter were further characterized. following their preliminary confirmation as lab, 150 strains were identified by combining morphological criteria, biochemical tests, and molecular methods, the latter inluding intergenic 16s- 23s pcr, specific lactobacilli pcr, and a biphasic approach. most of the lab isolated belonged to the genus lactobacillus, among them lb. sakei (33.3%), lb. salivarius (19.4%), lb. reuteri (8.6%), and lb. curvatus (8.6%). the other lab strains included those of the genus weissella (16.7%), enterococcus faecalis (5.3%), leuconostoc mesenteroides (2.7%), lactococcus graviae (2.7%), and streptococcus sp. (2.7%). the lactobacilli strains were tested for their antagonism against c. jejuni and c. coli. the activity of three of them, lb. salivarius smxd51, lb. salivarius mms122, and lb.  salivarius mms151, against the aforementioned target strains could be ascribed to the production of bacteriocins.

TI  == tlr ligands of lactobacillus sakei lk-117 isolated from seed mash for brewing sake are potent inducers of il-12.
AB  == many studies have investigated the immunostimulatory effects of bacteria, such as the anti-allergic effects of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and lab-fermented milk. importantly, these anti-allergic effects have been observed for both viable and nonviable bacteria. however, there are no reported immunological effects of lab isolated from kimoto, the traditional yeast starter culture used for brewing sake, which also involves spontaneous lactate fermentation. in this study, we determined whether the leuconostoc mesenteroides and lactobacillus sakei bacterial strains obtained from kimoto affected the production of interleukin-12  (il-12), an inducer of the t-helper type-1 immune response. by incubating autoclaved bacteria with j774.1 macrophage-like cells, we found that l. sakei lk-117 induced a sustained increase in il-12p40 production. the il-12-inducing ability of lk-117 was unaffected by anti-tlr2 neutralization and was entirely inhibited when the lk-117 cells were treated with rnase. when lk-117 cells were treated with m-1, an n-acetylmuramidase, at varying concentrations and for different periods of time, the ability of the bacteria to induce il-12 decreased  quickly. although an active fraction could be prepared by chromatography from the soluble products of enzymolysis, the fraction's induction ability was <2% of that of intact organisms, and induction ability disappeared completely upon anti-tlr2  neutralization after treating the active fraction with rnase. these results suggest that single-stranded rna released from cells that were disrupted by autoclaving might act as a tlr ligand and provide a novel mechanism in which heat-killed lab could be used to regulate immune activity.

TI  == autoinducer-2-like activity in lactic acid bacteria isolated from minced beef packaged under modified atmospheres.
AB  == fifteen fingerprints (assigned to leuconostoc spp., leuconostoc mesenteroides, weissella viridescens, leuconostoc citreum, and lactobacillus sakei) of 89 lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from minced beef stored under modified atmospheres at various temperatures were screened for their ability to exhibit autoinducer-2  (ai-2)-like activity under certain growth conditions. cellfree meat extracts (cfme) were collected at the same time as the lab isolates and tested for the presence of ai-2-like molecules. all bioassays were conducted using the vibrio harveyi baa-1117 (sensor 1(-), sensor 2(+)) biosensor strain. the possible inhibitory effect of meat extracts on the activity of the biosensor strain was also evaluated. ai-2-like activity was observed for leuconostoc spp. isolates, but none of the l. sakei strains produced detectable ai-2-like activity. the ai-2-like activity was evident mainly associated with the leuconostoc sp. b 233 strain, which was the dominant isolate recovered from storage at 10 and 15 degrees c and at the initial and middle stages of storage at chill temperatures (0 and 5 degrees c). the tested cfme samples displayed low ai-2-like activity and inhibited ai-2 activity regardless of the indigenous bacterial populations. the lab isolated during meat spoilage exhibited ai-2-like activity, whereas the lab strains retrieved depended on storage time and temperature. the production of ai-2-like molecules may affect the dominance of different bacterial strains during storage. the results provide a basis for further research concerning the effect of storage temperature on the expression of genes encoding ai-2 activity and on the diversity of the ephemeral bacterial population.

TI  == effect of high pressure treatment on microbial populations of sliced vacuum-packed cooked ham.
AB  == in this study, culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches were used to  reveal the microbial diversity and dynamic changes occurring in sliced vacuum-packed cooked ham after high pressure processing (hpp, 400mpa or 600mpa for 10min at 22 degrees c) during refrigerated storage over 90days. direct extraction of genome dna and total rna from meat samples, followed by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and rt-pcr-dgge on 16s rdna v3 region, was performed to define the structure of the bacterial populations and active species in pressurized cooked ham. results showed that hpp affected differently the various species detected. the predominant spoilage organisms of cooked ham, such as lactobacillus sakei and lactobacillus curvatus, were found to be very sensitive to pressure as they were unable to be detected in hpp samples at any time during refrigerated storage. weissella viridescens and leuconostoc mesenteroides survived hpp at 600mpa for 10min at 22 degrees c and were responsible for the final spoilage. an rna-based dgge approach clearly has potential for the analysis of active species that have survived in pressurized cooked ham. high pressure processing at 400 or 600mpa for 10min at room temperature (22 degrees c) has a powerful inhibitory effect on the major spoilage bacteria of sliced vacuum-packed cooked ham. high pressure treatment may lead to  reduced microbial diversity and improve the products' safety.

TI  == metagenomic analysis of kimchi, a traditional korean fermented food.
AB  == kimchi, a traditional food in the korean culture, is made from vegetables by fermentation. in this study, metagenomic approaches were used to monitor changes  in bacterial populations, metabolic potential, and overall genetic features of the microbial community during the 29-day fermentation process. metagenomic dna was extracted from kimchi samples obtained periodically and was sequenced using a 454 gs flx titanium system, which yielded a total of 701,556 reads, with an average read length of 438 bp. phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna genes from the metagenome indicated that the kimchi microbiome was dominated by members of three genera: leuconostoc, lactobacillus, and weissella. assignment of metagenomic sequences to seed categories of the metagenome rapid annotation using subsystem technology (mg-rast) server revealed a genetic profile characteristic of heterotrophic lactic acid fermentation of carbohydrates, which was supported by the detection of mannitol, lactate, acetate, and ethanol as fermentation products. when the metagenomic reads were mapped onto the database of completed genomes, the leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides atcc 8293 and lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei 23k genomes were highly represented. these same  two genera were confirmed to be important in kimchi fermentation when the majority of kimchi metagenomic sequences showed very high identity to leuconostoc mesenteroides and lactobacillus genes. besides microbial genome sequences, a surprisingly large number of phage dna sequences were identified from the cellular fractions, possibly indicating that a high proportion of cells were infected by bacteriophages during fermentation. overall, these results provide insights into the kimchi microbial community and also shed light on fermentation  processes carried out broadly by complex microbial communities.

AB  == isolation and identification of the autochthonous starter from a naturally fermented meat allows control of the fermentation process and promises microbiological safety for this specialty. thus the purpose of this study was to  identify the lactic acid bacteria and coagulase-negative cocci present in a traditional taiwanese naturally fermented ham (tnfh) and to study the microbial dynamics at different ripening stages; the approach was a combination of conventional microbiological cultivation, polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and dna sequencing. in total, twelve different strains of lactic acid bacteria and three staphylococcus strains were identified  in the tnfh samples, whereas only 5 dominant strains were observed in the tnfh samples when the dgge as a culture-independent method was applied. the bacterial  ecology on the surface of the samples was mainly characterized by the stable presence of lactobacillus sakei and staphylococcus saprophyticus; nonetheless leuconostoc mesenteroides and carnobacterium divergens were the most abundant bacteria found in the final product. these results are also agreed with the findings of the culture-independent method. in addition, microbacterium spp., carnobacterium spp., enterobacter spp., brochothrix spp., enterococcus spp., and  bacillus spp. were also present at the beginning of the ripening, but few bacteria were found at the center of the tnfh samples during the early ripening stages. however, after 30 days of ripening, the microbial ecology at the center of the tnfh samples paralleled that of the surface. finally, as far as we have been able to determine, our report is the first to investigate the microbiological dynamics in fermented meat products using combination of cultivation, the harrison disc method, dgge and dna sequencing as the culture-dependent method. our report is also the first to show the presence of staphylococcus arlettae in a fermented sausage and ham product.

TI  == microbiota analysis of caspian sea yogurt, a ropy fermented milk circulated in japan.
AB  == we analyzed the microbiota of domestic ropy fermented milk, caspian sea yogurt (or 'kasupikai yohguruto' in japanese), circulated in japan. we collected six varieties from five localities. lactococcus (l) lactis ssp. cremoris was isolated from all samples as the dominant strain at levels of 10(8)-10(9) cfu/g. we show this strain produces an extracellular polysaccharide (eps) that causes the unique characteristic viscosity of the product. from analysis of the rapd pattern of 60  bacterial isolates from the six samples, we found that 59 strains from a total of 60 isolates were identical and produced this viscosity. furthermore, pfge analysis of representative strains from each sample indicated that the isolates could be classified into four subgroups. this suggests these l. lactis ssp. cremoris strains found in caspian sea yogurt may have been slightly mutated during subculture in japan. in addition, lactobacillus (l.) sakei ssp. sakei were isolated from three samples; l. plantarum, gluconoacetobacter sacchari and acetobacter aceti were isolated from two samples; and l. paracasei, l. kefiri, leuconostoc (leu.) mesenteroides were isolated from one sample.

TI  == biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria in french wheat sourdough as determined by molecular characterization using species-specific pcr.
AB  == the lactic acid microflora of nine traditional wheat sourdoughs from the midi-pyrenees area (south western france) was previously isolated and preliminary characterized using conventional morphological and biochemical analysis. however, such phenotypic methods alone are not always reliable and have a low taxonomic resolution for identification of lactic acid bacteria species. in the present study, a total of 290 lab isolates were identified by pcr amplification using different sets of specific primers in order to provide a thorough characterization of the lactic flora from these traditional french sourdoughs. overall, the lab isolates belonged to 6 genera: lactobacillus (39%, 8 species), pediococcus (38%, 1 species), leuconostoc (17%, 2 species), weissella (4%, 2 species), lactococcus (1%, 1 species) and enterococcus (<1%, 1 species) and 15 different species were detected: l. plantarum, l. curvatus, l. paracasei, l. sanfranciscensis, l. pentosus, l. paraplantarum, l. sakei, l. brevis, p. pentosaceus, l. mesenteroides, l. citreum, w. cibaria, w. confusa, l. lactis and  e. hirae. facultative heterofermentative lab represent more than 76% of the total isolates, the main species isolated herein correspond to l. plantarum and p. pentosaceus. obligate heterofermentative lactobacilli (l. sanfranciscencis, l. brevis) represent less than 3% of the total isolates whereas leuconostoc and weissella species represent 21% of the total isolates and have been detected in eight of the nine samples. detection of some lab species was preferentially observed depending on the isolation culture medium. the number of different species within a sourdough varies from 3 to 7 and original associations of hetero- and homofermentative lab species have been revealed. results from this study clearly confirm the diversity encountered in the microbial community of traditional sourdough and highlight the importance of lab cocci in the sourdough  ecosystem, along with lactobacilli.

TI  == characterization of the bacterial spoilage flora in marinated pork products.
AB  == aims: to investigate the microbiota in marinated, vacuum-packed pork and to characterize isolated bacteria with regard to their spoilage potential. methods and results: laboratory marinated pork meat and commercial products from three norwegian producers were examined. lactic acid bacteria dominated in all products at the expiration date. the flora in marinated products was similar only for products from the same plant. strains of lactobacillus algidus, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus curvatus, carnobacterium divergens, carnobacterium maltaromaticum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc carnosum and leuconostoc sp. were isolated and tested for their spoilage potential. samples inoculated with lact. algidus or leuc. mesenteroides were rated as most unpleasant by randomly selected people. a sensory panel scored samples with lact. algidus highest for sour and intense odour. lactobacillus algidus was found in products from two out of three production plants. culture-independent dna isolation confirmed that cultivation on blood agar at 20 degrees c yielded a representative picture of the total flora in marinated flintsteak. conclusions: lactobacillus algidus may be an important, but underestimated, spoilage organism that needs to  be focused on more when spoilage of vacuum-packed meat is considered. significance and impact of the study: routine microbial testing may have to be revised in order to detect spoilage lab that are unable to grow under currently used conditions.

TI  == phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from "alheira", a traditional fermented sausage produced in portugal.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from "alheira", a fermented sausage produced  in portugal. lab were identified to genus and species level by phenotypic characteristics, using genus or species-specific primers and sequencing of the gene encoding 16s rrna. two-hundred and eighty-three isolates were grouped into 14 species. lactobacillus plantarum was isolated from all sausages and enterococcusfaecalis from most of the samples. low numbers of lactobacillus paraplantarum, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus zeae, lactobacillus paracasei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, pediococcus pentosaceus, pediococcus acidilactici, weissella cibaria, weissella viridescens and enterococcus faecium were recorded. the genetic heterogeneity of  l. plantarum and e. faecalis strains were determined by numerical analysis of dna banding patterns obtained by rapd-pcr. strains of l. plantarum and e. faecalis were different from different producers. this study forms the basis from which starter cultures could be selected for production of "alheira".

TI  == biodegradation of chlorpyrifos by lactic acid bacteria during kimchi fermentation.
AB  == we examined the role of microorganisms in the degradation of the organophosphorus (op) insecticide chlorpyrifos (cp) during kimchi fermentation. during the fermentation of kimchi, 30 mg l(-1) of cp was added and its stability assayed during fermentation. cp was degraded rapidly until day 3 (83.3%) and degraded completely by day 9. four cp-degrading lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from kimchi fermentation in the presence of 200 mg l(-1) cp and were identified as leuconostoc mesenteroides wcp907, lactobacillus brevis wcp902, lactobacillus plantarum wcp931, and lactobacillus sakei wcp904. cp could be utilized by these four strains as the sole source of carbon and phosphorus. coumaphos (cm), diazinon (dz), parathion (pt), and methylparathion (mpt) were also degraded by wcp907, wcp902, wcp931, and wcp904 when provided as sole sources of carbon and phosphorus.

TI  == novel multiplex pcr for the detection of lactic acid bacteria during kimchi fermentation.
AB  == we developed a multiplex pcr assay for the detection of lactic acid bacteria (lab) species, and used it to examine the lab species involved in kimchi fermentation. the lab profile during kimchi fermentation varied with ph and acidity. leuconostoc mesenteroides was observed during early fermentation (ph 5.64-4.27 and acidity 0.48-0.89%), and lactobacillus sakei become dominant later  in fermentation (ph <or=4.15 and acidity >or=0.98%). the efficiency of the multiplex pcr ranged from 86.5% at day 0 (ph 6.17 and acidity 0.24%) to 100% at day 96 (ph 4.16 and acidity 1.14). this multiplex pcr assay will facilitate study of the microbial ecosystem of kimchi and its impact on kimchi fermentation.

TI  == study of the lactobacillus sakei protective effect towards spoilage bacteria in vacuum packed cooked ham analyzed by pcr-dgge.
AB  == the effectiveness of lactobacillus sakei b-2 inoculated as a protective culture on the inhibition of spoilage bacteria on sliced vacuum packed cooked ham was investigated by using culture-dependent and -independent approaches. total microbial dna was directly extracted from both control and treatment samples, and subjected to a nested pcr protocol, pcr-dgge analysis was used to identify and monitor the dynamic changes in the microbial population, followed by partial 16s  rdna sequencing. the dgge profile demonstrated that the protective culture effectively suppressed growth of predominant spoilage bacteria l. sakei, lactobacillus curvatus and leuconostoc mesenteroides in cooked ham during storage at 4 degrees c, however, growth of uncultured leuconostoc was not inhibited. the  shelf-life of this product inoculated with l. sakei b-2, at levels of 5.91+/-0.04log(10)cfug(-1) was 35 days, compared to 15 days of control samples, when the ham was stored at 4 degrees c.

TI  == application of neural networks to simulate the growth profile of lactic acid bacteria in green olive fermentation.
AB  == the growth profile of five strains of lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus plantarum aca-dc 287, l. plantarum aca-dc 146, lactobacillus paracasei aca-dc 4037, lactobacillus sakei lqc 1378, and leuconostoc mesenteroides lqc 1398) was investigated in controlled fermentation of cv. conservolea green olives with a multilayer perceptron network, a combined logistic-fermi function, and a two-term gompertz function. neural network training was based on the steepest-descent gradient learning algorithm. model performance was compared with the experimental data with five statistical indices, namely coefficient of determination (r2), root mean square error (rmse), mean relative percentage error (mrpe), mean absolute percentage error (mape), and standard error of prediction (sep). the experimental data set consisted of 125 counts (cfu per milliliter) of lactic acid bacteria during the green olive fermentation process for up to 38 days (5 strains x 25 sampling days). for model development, a standard methodology was followed,  dividing the data set into training (120 data) and validation (25 data) subsets.  our results demonstrated that the developed network was able to model the growth  and survival profile of all the strains of lactic acid bacteria during fermentation equally well with the statistical models. the performance indices for the training subset of the multilayer perceptron network were r2 = 0.987, rmse = 0.097, mrpe = 0.069, mape = 0.933, and sep = 1.316. the relevant mean values for the logistic-fermi and two-term gompertz functions were r2 = 0.981 and 0.989, rmse = 0.109 and 0.083, mrpe = 0.026 and 0.030, mape = 1.430 and 1.076, and sep = 1.490 and 1.127, respectively. for the validation subset, the network also gave good predictions (r2 = 0.968, rmse = 0.149, mrpe = 0.100, mape = 1.411, and sep = 2.009).

TI  == enhancement of the immune response and protection induced by probiotic lactic acid bacteria against furunculosis in rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss).
AB  == we analysed the effect of probiotic strains on the cellular and humoral immune responses of rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss), and their capacity to prevent furunculosis during a challenge trial. probiotic strains (lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis clfp 100, leuconostoc mesenteroides clfp 196, and lactobacillus sakei clfp 202) were administered orally to fish for 2 weeks at 10(6) cfu g(-1) of feed. in  comparison to untreated control fish, the phagocytic activity of head kidney leukocytes and the alternative complement activity in serum were significantly greater in all probiotic groups at the end of the second week. with the exception of the group fed with lactobacillus sakei, superoxide anion production was also significantly increased in the probiotic groups. analysis of lysozyme activity did not exhibit any significant difference in the probiotic and control groups. fifteen days after the start of the probiotic feeding, fish were challenged with  aeromonas salmonicida ssp. salmonicida. the fish supplemented with probiotics exhibited survival rates ranging from 97.8% to 100%, whereas survival was 65.6% in fish not treated with the probiotics. these results demonstrate that probiotic supplementation to fish can reduce the severity of furunculosis, and suggest that this reduction may be associated with enhanced humoral and cellular immune response.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria associated with vacuum-packed cooked meat product spoilage:  population analysis by rdna-based methods.
AB  == aim: to determine the lactic acid bacteria (lab) implicated in bloating spoilage  of vacuum-packed and refrigerated meat products. methods and results: a total of  18 samples corresponding to four types of meat products, with and without spoilage symptoms, were studied. in all, 387 colonies growing on de man, rogosa and sharpe, yeast glucose lactose peptone and trypticase soy yeast extract plates were identified by internal spacer region (isr), isr-restriction fragment length  polymorphism and rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis profiles as lactobacillus (37%), leuconostoc (43%), carnobacterium (11%), enterococcus (4%) and lactococcus (2%). leuconostoc mesenteroides dominated the microbial population of spoiled products and was always present at the moment bloating occurred. lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus curvatus were found in decreasing order of abundance. the analysis of two meat products, 'morcilla' and 'fiambre de magro adobado' obtained from production lines revealed a common succession pattern in lab populations in both products and showed that leuc. mesenteroides became the main species during storage, despite being below the detection level of culture methods after packing. conclusions: our results pointed to leuc. mesenteroides as the main species responsible for bloating spoilage in vacuum-packed meat products. significance and impact of the study: prevention of bloating spoilage in vacuum-packed cooked meat products requires the sensitive detection of leuc. mesenteroides (i.e. by pcr).

TI  == the sensory acceptability of cooked meat products treated with a protective culture depends on glucose content and buffering capacity: a case study with lactobacillus sakei 10a.
AB  == biopreservation has been proven to be a promising natural preservation technique, but the impact of protective cultures on the sensory properties of cooked meat products (cmp) is not well documented. this work presents a case study on the protective culture lactobacillus sakei 10a to obtain a clear view on the real consequences of using protective cultures on the sensory quality of cmp. a preliminary screening study on 13 different cmp and more elaborate application trials at 7 degrees c on vacuum packaged pate, cooked ham, cooked sausage and two cooked poultry products demonstrated that l. sakei 10a inhibits the endogenous lab-flora, leuconostoc mesenteroides, brochothrix thermosphacta and listeria monocytogenes. despite these promising antagonistic effects, the application of l. sakei 10a to cmp was in some cases limited by a significant acidification resulting in an acid taste of the product. this was most obvious in pate and cooked sausage and less obvious in cooked turkey fillet. from the results a hypothesis could be derived that high buffering capacity and low glucose content  are key elements to avoid sensory deviations when applying protective cultures on cmp.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == safety properties and molecular strain typing of lactic acid bacteria from slightly fermented sausages.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the biodiversity of lactobacilli from slightly fermented sausages (chorizo, fuet and salchichon) by molecular typing, while considering their safety aspects. methods and results: species-specific pcr, plasmid profiling and randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr were used to characterize 250 lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from 21 low acid spanish fermented sausages. lactobacillus sakei was the predominant species (74%) followed by lactobacillus curvatus (21.2%) and leuconostoc mesenteroides (4.8%).  by plasmid profiling and rapd-pcr 144 different strains could be differentiated,  112 belonging to lact. sakei, 23 to lact. curvatus and 9 to leuc. mesenteroides.  ion-pair high performance liquid chromatography was used to detect biogenic amine production. tyramine and phenylethylamine were produced by 14.4 and 12.4% of the  isolates, respectively, all belonging to the species lact. curvatus. the production of tyramine was stronger than that of phenylethylamine. partial sequencing of the tyrosine decarboxylase gene from lact. curvatus was achieved. a specific pcr assay to detect the lact. curvatus tyramine-producers was designed.  the disc diffusion test was used to detect antibiotic resistance among the isolates. most isolates displayed resistance to vancomycin and gentamicin. only four strains were resistant to most of the antibiotics tested. none of the isolates were resistant to erythromycin. conclusions: lactobacillus sakei would be the species of choice for further use as starter culture in fermented sausage  production. strain typing and characterization of biogenic amine production together with antibiotic susceptibility testing for the selection of starter cultures could help to increase the quality and safety of the products. significance and impact of the study: species-specific pcr, rapd and plasmid profiling proved to be efficient at typing lab at species and strain level. information on biogenic amine production and transferable antibiotic resistance is important in order to avoid selection of strains with undesirable properties as starter cultures.

TI  == co-culture experiments demonstrate the usefulness of lactobacillus sakei 10a to prolong the shelf-life of a model cooked ham.
AB  == this study investigated the usefulness of two selected lactic acid bacteria, lactobacillus sakei subsp. carnosus (10a) and the lactocin s producing l. sakei 148 (ls5), to extend the shelf-life of cooked meat products. the interaction between these potential protective cultures and the spoilage organisms, leuconostoc mesenteroides (lm4) and brochothrix thermosphacta (bt1), were examined in co-culture studies on a model cooked ham product at 7 degrees c under vacuum packaged conditions. furthermore, the influence of the glucose content of  the model cooked ham on the interaction phenomena was investigated. when artificially contaminating the model cooked ham with bt1 at 10(2) cfu/g in combination with 10a at 10(5) cfu/g, the growth of bt1 was significantly slower compared to a simultaneous mono-culture experiment. in a similar experiment with  lm4, lm4 reached a level of 10(7) cfu/g +/-14 days later when lm4 grew together with 10a compared to its growth in mono-culture. the lactocin s producing ls5 did not demonstrate an inhibitory action towards lm4 or bt1 and is therefore not useful as protective culture on cooked meat products. the glucose level of the model cooked ham had no influence on the observed antagonistic interactions of 10a towards lm4 or bt1, indicating that the action of the biopreservative 10a in  cooked meat products is independent of the substrate glucose.

TI  == characterization of islpl4, a functional insertion sequence in lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == a lactobacillus plantarum strain, cect 4645, was found to have insertions of a sequence (985 bp in length) at least in eight loci in its genome. the prototype copy (lp1) of this insertion sequence (named islpl4) has one open reading frame encoding a putative protein that is 292 amino acids in length with significant levels of similarity with is982 family transposases. perfect 16-bp inverted repeats were found at its termini. upon transposition, generates 8-bp direct repeats of the target sequence, but no consensus sequences could be identified at either insertion site. the islpl4 pattern changed over many generations on the cect 4645 strain. this finding strongly supports our hypothesis that islpl4 is a  functional element in l. plantarum. some of these elements may be cryptic, since  point mutation or 1-nucleotide deletions were found in their transposase encoding genes. islpl4 copies have been detected in leuconostoc mesenteroides, oenococcus  oeni, and lactobacillus sakei. an islpl4 copy of o. oeni contained a +1 nucleotide insertion on its transposase encoding gene and, by using an experimental system, we were able to demonstrate that this specific sequence originates a +1 programmed translational frameshifting. although the frameshifting process reported here operates at a low rate, this description might represent the first case of a functional +1 frameshifting among is.

AB  == a total of 176 lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from a typical spanish blood sausage called "morcilla de burgos" were identified by means of phenotypic characteristics and 16s rdna rflp (ribotyping). lab were isolated from "morcilla" of different producers and in different storage periods, which includes unpackaged, vacuum and modified atmosphere packaged "morcilla" and vacuum packed  and pasteurised "morcilla". the knowledge of specific spoilage bacteria of "morcilla de burgos" will be useful to design new preservation methods to extend  the shelf-life of this product. identification made according to phenotypic and biochemical characteristics shows the majority of the isolates were heterofermentative lab (93.2%) and eight different bacterial groups could be distinguished (a-g). weisella viridescens was the main species detected (42%). in addition, leuconostoc spp. (23.9%), weissella confusa (11.4%) and lactobacillus fructosus (5.7%) species were found. few strains were phenotypically misidentified as lactobacillus sanfrancisco, pediococcus spp., lactobacillus sakei/curvatus and carnobacterium spp. and 11 strains remained unknown. most of the leuconostocs were identified as leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc carnosum species. ribotyping shows a quite good correlation with phenotypic methods, although it has been possible to identify 15 different clusters. w. viridescens and leuconostocs were also the predominant lab. strains identified as w. confusa by phenotypic characteristics were resolved in w. confusa and weissella cibaria by ribotyping. neither carnobacterium piscicola nor lb. sanfrancisco were identified by means of genotypic method. all lb. fructosus strains and some more included in different phenotypic groups (17 strains in total) could not be associated with any reference strain (cluster vii).

TI  == evaluation of meat born lactic acid bacteria as protective cultures for the biopreservation of cooked meat products.
AB  == in this study, 91 strains, originating from meat products, were subjected to a step-by-step screening and characterisation to search for potential protective cultures to be used in the cooked cured meat industry. strains were first tested  on their homofermentative and psychrotrophic character and salt tolerance. secondly, the antibacterial capacities towards listeria monocytogenes, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc carnosum and brochotrix thermosphacta were determined in an agar spot test. in total, 38% of the tested strains were inhibitory towards all indicator strains. however, 91%, 88% and 74% of the strains could inhibit, respectively, l. monocytogenes, b. thermosphacta and leuc. mesenteroides. finally, 12 strains, with the highest antibacterial capacities, were evaluated on their competitive nature by comparing their growth rate, acidifying character and lactic acid production at 7 degrees c under anaerobic conditions in a liquid broth. all 12 strains, except for a bacteriocin producing  lactobacillus plantarum strain and the lactocin s producing lactobacillus sakei 148, combined a fast growth rate with a deep and rapid acidification caused by the production of high levels of lactic acid. the 12 selected strains were then further investigated for their growth capacity on a model cooked ham product to establish whether the presence of these cultures on the ham did not negatively influence the sensory properties of the ham. all strains grew in 6 days at 7 degrees c from a level of 10(5)-10(6) to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g and again the bacteriocin producing l. plantarum strain was the slowest growing strain. as the  glucose level of the model cooked ham product was low (0.09+/-0.03%), growth of the putative protective cultures resulted in glucose depletion and a limited lactic acid production and accompanying ph decrease. cooked ham inoculated with isolates 13e, 10a, 14a (all three identified as l. sakei subsp. carnosus by sds-page) and with strains l. sakei 148 (ls5) and l. sakei subsp. carnosus saga 777 (ls8) were not rejected by the sensory panel at the 34th day of the vacuum packaged storage at 7 degrees c. therefore, these strains could have potential for the use as protective culture in cooked meat products.

TI  == influence of antimicrobial agents on the spoilage of a meat-based entomophage diet.
AB  == the microbial decomposition of a meat-based entomophage diet presented in parafilm packets was investigated. considerable bacteria but not fungi were associated with components used to prepare the diet (i.e., hens' eggs, liver, and ground beef). at the initial sampling time, there were no differences among diet  treatments in the size of bacterial or fungal populations. bacterial populations  in diets not containing antibacterial agents rapidly increased and reached an asymptote by 24 h (approximately 10(10) colony-forming units per gram). bacterial populations also increased in diets containing antibacterial agents, but they were significantly smaller than in diets not containing antibacterial agents. the most prevalent bacteria isolated were carnobacterium piscicola, carnobacterium divergens, lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus sakei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and enterococcus spp., regardless of the antibacterial treatment used. the proliferation of fungi was delayed relative to bacteria, but significant differences were observed among the diet treatments. fungi were most  inhibited by sorbic acid and propionic acid in the absence of antibacterial agents. the most common fungi isolated were the yeasts candida zeylanoides, torulaspora globosa, and yarrowia lipolytica. the ph of diets not containing antibacterial agents decreased rapidly and was highly correlated with increases in bacteria but not fungi. the results of this study demonstrate that antimicrobial agents significantly inhibit spoilage microorganisms in a meat-based diet and that alternative management strategies to delay the decomposition of such diets presented in parafilm packets should target lactic acid spoilage bacteria, particularly carnobacterium and lactobacillus species.

TI  == study of the ecology of fresh sausages and characterization of populations of lactic acid bacteria by molecular methods.
AB  == in this study, a polyphasic approach was used to study the ecology of fresh sausages and to characterize populations of lactic acid bacteria (lab). the microbial profile of fresh sausages was monitored from the production day to the  10th day of storage at 4 degrees c. samples were collected on days 0, 3, 6, and 10, and culture-dependent and -independent methods of detection and identification were applied. traditional plating and isolation of lab strains, which were subsequently identified by molecular methods, and the application of pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) to dna and rna extracted directly from the fresh sausage samples allowed the study in detail of the changes in the bacterial and yeast populations during storage. brochothrix thermosphacta and lactobacillus sakei were the main populations present. in particular, b. thermosphacta was present throughout the process, as determined by both dna and rna analysis. other bacterial species, mainly staphylococcus xylosus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and l. curvatus, were detected by dgge. moreover, an uncultured bacterium and an uncultured staphylococcus sp. were present, too. lab strains isolated at day 0 were identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, l. casei, and enterococcus casseliflavus, and on day 3 a strain of leuconostoc mesenteroides was identified. the remaining strains isolated belonged to l. sakei. concerning the yeast ecology, only debaryomyces hansenii was established in the fresh sausages. capronia mansonii was initially present, but it was not detected after the first 3 days. at last, l. sakei isolates were characterized by randomly amplified polymorphic dna pcr and repetitive dna element pcr. the results obtained underlined how different populations took over  at different steps of the process. this is believed to be the result of the selection of the particular population, possibly due to the low storage temperature employed.

TI  == increased complexity of the species composition of lactic acid bacteria in human  feces revealed by alternative incubation condition.
AB  == denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of dna fragments generated by pcr  with primers specific for lactic acid bacteria (lab) was applied to investigate various media and incubation conditions to recover lab from human feces. samples  were plated on selective and nonselective media and incubated under standard condition (37 degrees c, anaerobiosis) for fecal lab as well as alternative condition (30 degrees c, 2% o2). pcr-dgge analyses of resuspended bacterial biomass (rbb) obtained from agar plates revealed that the species composition of  the recovered lab was affected more strongly by the incubation condition than by  the used medium. it was observed that food-associated lab, such as lactobacillus  sakei and leuconostoc mesenteroides, hitherto not described as intestinal inhabitants, are more easily selected when the alternative incubation condition is used. identification of randomly picked colonies grown under the alternative condition showed that l. sakei is one of the predominant food-associated lab species, reaching counts of up to 106 cfu/g feces. comparison of the results of bacteriological culture with those obtained by pcr-dgge analysis of the rbb showed that investigation of rbb is a fast and reliable method to gain insight into the species composition of culturable lab in feces.

TI  == an analysis of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from malted barley.
AB  == aims: the aim of this study was to perform a detailed characterization of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from malted barley.  methods and results: bacteriocin activities produced by eight lab, isolated from  various types of malted barley, were purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulphate precipitation, cation exchange, hydrophobic interaction and reverse-phase liquid  chromatography. molecular mass analysis and n-terminal amino acid sequencing of the purified bacteriocins showed that four non-identical lactobacillus sakei strains produced sakacin p, while four leuconostoc mesenteroides strains were shown to produce bacteriocins highly similar or identical to leucocin a, leucocin c or mesenterocin y105. two of these bacteriocin-producing strains, lb. sakei 5 and leuc. mesenteroides 6, were shown to produce more than one bacteriocin. lactobacillus sakei 5 produced sakacin p as well as two novel bacteriocins, which were termed sakacin 5x and sakacin 5t. the inhibitory spectrum of each purified bacteriocin was analysed and demonstrated that sakacin 5x was capable of inhibiting the widest range of beer spoilage organisms. conclusion: all bacteriocins purified in this study were class ii bacteriocins. two of the bacteriocins have not been described previously in the literature while the remaining purified bacteriocins have been isolated from environments other than malted barley. significance and impact of the study: this study represents a thorough analysis of bacteriocin-producing lab from malt and demonstrates, for the first time, the variety of previously identified and novel inhibitory peptides produced by isolates from this environment. it also highlights the potential of these lab cultures to be used as biological controlling agents in the brewing industry.

TI  == detection of lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, and weissella species in human feces by using group-specific pcr primers and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of dna fragments generated by pcr  with 16s ribosomal dna-targeted group-specific primers was used to detect lactic  acid bacteria (lab) of the genera lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, and weissella in human feces. analysis of fecal samples of four subjects revealed individual profiles of dna fragments originating not only from species that have  been described as intestinal inhabitants but also from characteristically food-associated bacteria such as lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus curvatus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and pediococcus pentosaceus. comparison of pcr-dgge results with those of bacteriological culture showed that the food-associated species could not be cultured from the fecal samples by plating on rogosa agar. on the other hand, all of the lab species cultured from feces were detected in the dgge profile. we also detected changes in the types of lab present in human feces during consumption of a milk product containing the probiotic strain lactobacillus rhamnosus dr20. the analysis of fecal samples from two subjects taken before, during, and after administration of the probiotic revealed that l.  rhamnosus was detectable by pcr-dgge during the test period in the feces of both  subjects, whereas it was detectable by culture in only one of the subjects.

TI  == surface application of lysozyme, nisin, and edta to inhibit spoilage and pathogenic bacteria on ham and bologna.
AB  == a study was conducted to determine if the effectiveness of an antimicrobial treatment for cooked ham and bologna would be increased or maintained when applied in a surface coating. cooked 10-g disks of ham and bologna sausage received one of three treatments: no coating (control), coating with 0.2 g of 7%  (wt/vol) gelatin gel (gel-control), or coating with 0.2 g of 7% gelatin gel containing 25.5 g/liter of lysozyme-nisin (1:3) plus 25.5 g/liter of edta (gel-treated). the samples were then inoculated with one of six test organisms: brochothrix thermosphacta, escherichia coli o157:h7, lactobacillus sakei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, listeria monocytogenes, or salmonella typhimurium. inoculated samples were vacuum packed and stored at 8 degrees c for 4 weeks. the  antimicrobial gel treatment had an immediate bactericidal effect up to 4 log cfu/cm2 on the four gram-positive organisms tested (b. thermosphacta, lactobacillus sakei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and listeria monocytogenes) and inhibited the growth of these organisms during the 4 weeks of storage. the antimicrobial gel treatment also had a bactericidal effect on the growth of salmonella typhimurium during storage. the numbers of e. coli o157:h7 on ham were reduced by 2 log cfu/cm2 following treatment with both antimicrobial-containing and non-antimicrobial-containing gels during the 4-week storage period. no effect was observed on the growth of e. coli o157:h7 on bologna.

TI  == the spoilage microflora of cured, cooked turkey breasts prepared commercially with or without smoking.
AB  == lactobacillus sakei subsp. carnosus was predominant in the spoilage flora of sliced, vacuum-packed, smoked, oven-cooked turkey breast fillets which developed  mild, sour spoilage flavors after 4 weeks storage at 4 degrees c. in contrast, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides predominated in the spoilage flora of sliced, vacuum-packed, unsmoked, boiled turkey breast fillets from the same plant which were also stored at 4 degrees c. the spoilage flora of the unsmoked breasts grew faster than that of the smoked breasts and was more diverse. lactobacillus sakei, weissella viridescens and an atypical group of leuconostoc-like bacteria were also members of the unsmoked turkey breasts flora. consequently, the unsmoked breasts spoiled after 2 weeks at 4 degrees c: the packs swelled and the meat developed strong sour odors and flavors and abundant slime. except for the unidentified leuconostocs, which apparently survived boiling of the unsmoked turkey, all the spoilage organisms contaminated the meats during the slicing and vacuum packaging operations. from their biochemical reactions and cellular fatty acid profiles, the atypical leuconostocs were more closely related to leuconostoc carnosum than w. viridescens. carnobacteria and brochothrix thermosphacta were present in relatively large numbers on the raw turkey, but were not numerous in the spoilage flora of the cooked, vacuum-packed  meat products.

TI  == the microbial association of greek taverna sausage stored at 4 and 10 degrees c in air, vacuum or 100% carbon dioxide, and its spoilage potential.
AB  == strains of the lactobacillus sakei/curvatus group, mainly non-slime-producing lact. sakei, dominated the microbial flora of industrially manufactured taverna sausage, a traditional greek cooked meat, stored at 4 degrees c and 10 degrees c  in air, vacuum and 100% co2. atypical, arginine-positive and melibiose-negative strains of this group were isolated. the isolation frequency of lact. sakei/curvatus from sausages stored anaerobically was as high as 92-96%, while other meat spoilage organisms were practically absent. conversely, in air-stored  sausages, leuconostocs, mainly leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. mesenteroides, had  a considerable presence (14-21%), whereas brochothrix thermosphacta, pseudomonads and micrococcaceae grew, but failed to increase above 10(5) cfu g(-1) in all samples during storage. only yeasts were able to compete against lab and reached  almost 10(7) cfu g(-1) after 30 d of aerobic storage at 10 degrees c. the great dominance (> 10(8) cfu g(-1)) of lab caused a progressive decrease of ph and an increase of the concentration of l-lactate, d-lactate and acetate in all sausage  packs. the growth of lab and its associated chemical changes were more pronounced at 10 degrees c than 4 degrees c. at both storage temperatures, l-lactate and acetate increased more rapidly and to a higher concentration aerobically, unlike  d-lactate, which formed in higher amounts anaerobically. storage in air was the worst packaging method, resulting in greening and unpleasant off-odours associated with the high acetate content of the sausages. carbon dioxide had no significant effect on extending shelf-life. the factors affecting the natural selection of lact. sakei/curvatus in taverna sausage are discussed. moreover, it  was attempted to correlate the metabolic activity of this group with the physicochemical changes and the spoilage phenomena occurring in taverna sausage under the different storage conditions.

TI  == characterisation of lactic acid bacteria from spoiled, vacuum-packaged, cold-smoked rainbow trout using ribotyping.
AB  == a total of 405 lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from spoiled, vacuum-packaged, salted, sodium nitrite- or potassium nitrate-treated, cold-smoked rainbow trout stored at 4 degrees c or 8 degrees c were characterised and identified using a molecular method. the isolates were initially classified according to their restriction endonuclease profiles using hindiii and ecori restriction endonucleases and further characterised by rrna gene restriction patterns (ribotypes). numerical analysis of these ribopatterns was performed together with 19 reference lab strain patterns in order to identify the isolates to species level. the strains were divided with hindiii and ecori ribopatterns into ten and  nine clusters at the similarity level of 65% and 50%, respectively. the leuconostoc-clusters and the lb. sakei/lb. curvatus-clusters formed the two main  groups. only one isolate was identified as lactobacillus plantarum and no carnobacterium strains were discovered. for both enzymes, the 35 isolates possessing six individual ribotypes and forming five clusters could not be identified further with the reference strains used. the relative proportion of leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides was higher in all samples stored at 4 degrees c. most of the leuconostoc citreum were found in the samples stored  at 8 degrees c, and particularly in the nitrite-treated samples.
