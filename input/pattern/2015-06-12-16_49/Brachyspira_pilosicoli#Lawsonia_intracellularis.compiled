TI  - Clinical utility and performance of sock sampling in weaner pig diarrhoea.
AB  - Low pathogen diarrhoea is a group-level diagnosis, characterised by non-haemorrhagic diarrhoea. In the current study, the apparent prevalence of low pathogen diarrhoea outbreaks in Danish herds was investigated along with the clinical utility of a laboratory examination for intestinal disease, agreement between three consecutive herd examinations from the same herd and agreement between quantitative PCR results from pooled faecal samples and sock samples. Twenty-four veterinarians submitted faecal and sock samples for quantitative PCR testing from outbreaks of diarrhoea in nursery pigs (n=38 herds) where the farmer or veterinarian had decided that antimicrobial treatment was necessary. The veterinarians were asked to fill in a questionnaire and participate in telephone interviews. The apparent prevalence of low pathogen diarrhoea was 0.18 (95% CL: 0.08-0.34). Agreement between the veterinarians' clinical aetiological diagnosis and the pooled faecal sample was 0.18 (95% CL: 0.08-0.34), and Cohen's Kappa was 0.03 (95% CL: -0.08 to 0.14). Antibiotic treatment or prevention strategies were changed in 0.63 (95% CL: 0.46-0.78) of the herds, and the veterinarians indicated that, for 0.32 (95% CL: 0.18-0.50) of the herds, changes were related to the diagnostic results from the laboratory examination performed in the study. In 0.16 (95% CL: 0.05-0.36) of the herds, the same infections were demonstrated at all three consecutive examinations. No herds had three consecutive diarrhoea outbreaks classified as low pathogen diarrhoea. For the quantitative results (log10 of the summed amounts of Lawsonia intracellularis, Brachyspira pilosicoli, Escherichia coli F4 and F18) agreement between pooled faecal samples and sock samples was evaluated. Lin's concordance correlation coefficient was 0.69 (95% CL: 0.48-0.82), and the mean difference between the two types of samples was -0.38 log10 bacteria/g faeces (SD=1.59log10 bacteria/g faeces; 95% CI: -0.90 to 0.14log10 bacteria/g faeces). Agreement for the dichotomised results was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.75-0.97) when test results were classified as low pathogen diarrhoea or not, and Cohen's Kappa was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.26-0.95). In relation to detection of the individual infections, agreement was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.46-0.78), and Cohen's Kappa was 0.53 (95% CI: 0.34-0.71). In conclusion, low pathogen diarrhoea is a common finding amongst diarrhoea outbreaks that are subjected to antibiotic batch treatment in Danish nursery pigs. Sock samples seem to offer a reliable diagnostic method with impact on clinical decisions for treatment and prevention. However, both the diarrhoea type and the aetiology change with time in the majority of herds, indicating a potential need for frequent diagnostic examinations.
TI  - Herd diagnosis of low pathogen diarrhoea in growing pigs - a pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The major indication for antibiotic use in Danish pigs is treatment of intestinal diseases post weaning. Clinical decisions on antibiotic batch medication are often based on inspection of diarrhoeic pools on the pen floor. In some of these treated diarrhoea outbreaks, intestinal pathogens can only be demonstrated in a small number of pigs within the treated group (low pathogen diarrhoea). Termination of antibiotic batch medication in herds suffering from such diarrhoea could potentially reduce the consumption of antibiotics in the pig industry. The objective of the present pilot study was to suggest criteria for herd diagnosis of low pathogen diarrhoea in growing pigs. Data previously collected from 20 Danish herds were used to create a case series of clinical diarrhoea outbreaks normally subjected to antibiotic treatment. In the present study, these diarrhoea outbreaks were classified as low pathogen (<15% of the pigs having bacterial intestinal disease) (n =5 outbreaks) or high pathogen (>/=15% of the pigs having bacterial intestinal disease) (n =15 outbreaks). Based on the case series, different diagnostic procedures were explored, and criteria for herd diagnosis of low pathogen diarrhoea were suggested. The effect of sampling variation was explored by simulation. RESULTS: The diagnostic procedure with the highest combined herd-level sensitivity and specificity was qPCR testing of a pooled sample containing 20 randomly selected faecal samples. The criteria for a positive test result (high pathogen diarrhoea outbreak) were an average of 1.5 diarrhoeic faecal pools on the floor of each pen in the room under investigation and a pathogenic bacterial load >/=35,000 per gram in the faecal pool tested by qPCR. The bacterial load was the sum of Lawsonia intracellularis, Brachyspira pilosicoli and Escherichia coli F4 and F18 bacteria per gram faeces. The herd-diagnostic performance was (herd-level) diagnostic sensitivity =0.99, diagnostic specificity =0.80, positive predictive value =0.94 and negative predictive value =0.96. CONCLUSIONS: The pilot study suggests criteria for herd diagnosis of low pathogen diarrhoea in growing pigs. The suggested criteria should now be evaluated, and the effect of terminating antibiotic batch medication in herds identified as suffering from low pathogen diarrhoea should be explored.
TI  - Diagnostic performance of fecal quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction  for detection of Lawsonia intracellularis-associated proliferative enteropathy in nursery pigs.
AB  - Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) tests for detection and quantification of Lawsonia intracellularis in feces from pigs have been developed. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of a fecal qPCR test for detection of nursery pigs with L. intracellularis-associated proliferative enteropathy (PE) under field conditions. Furthermore, the diagnostic performance for different subpopulations of pigs was investigated, including pigs infected or noninfected with Porcine circovirus-2, Brachyspira pilosicoli, and Escherichia coli. The diagnostic performance was evaluated in terms of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. Data from pigs originating from 20 herds with antibiotic treatment requiring diarrhea outbreaks from a prior study were reused. Before treatment, pigs were randomly selected for histological and immunohistochemical examination of intestinal segments and fecal quantification of L. intracellularis by qPCR. A total of 313 pigs (157 without diarrhea, 156 with diarrhea) were included in the statistical analysis, and 37 pigs (11.8%) were classified as PE positives (defined as proliferative histological lesions in combination with L. intracellularis demonstration by immunohistochemistry). Lawsonia intracellularis was detected by qPCR in feces from 91 pigs (29.1%). A nonparametric receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis provided an area under the ROC curve (0.93) and an optimal cutoff value of 4.8 log10 L. intracellularis bacteria/g feces. This cutoff provided a diagnostic sensitivity of 0.84 and diagnostic specificity of 0.93. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were significantly different between herds (P < 0.0001). Numerically, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were different between subpopulations of pigs, but no significant differences were demonstrated.
TI  - Analysis of bacterial load and prevalence of mixed infections with Lawsonia intracellularis, Brachyspira hyodysenteriae and/or Brachyspira pilosicoli in German pigs with diarrhoea.
AB  - Lawsonia (L.) intracellularis, Brachyspira (B.) hyodysenteriae and B. pilosicoli  are important pathogens in domestic pig production world-wide, responsible for porcine intestinal adenomatosis, swine dysentery, and porcine intestinal spirochetosis, respectively. Conventional PCR is the major diagnostic tool in the detection of the three pathogens, but the sole detection of bacterial DNA might lead to misinterpretations of results with respect to their clinical relevance, especially with mixed infections. Thus, the present study targeted the detection and quantification of the three pathogens in samples from herds with a case history of diarrhoea. Herds and samples were selected by the practitioners on a voluntary basis. Results were based on 1176 individual samples from 95 herds from Southern Germany. The pathogens were detected simultaneously by multiplex real-time PCR. The overall prevalence for L. intracellularis, B. hyodysenteriae and B. pilosicoli was 12.6%, 8.4% and 3.2% in faecal samples and 48.4%, 24.2% and 31.6% in herds, respectively. Sixty one percent, 82.6%, and 73.4% of herds positive for L. intracellularis, B. hyodysenteriae, and B. pilosicoli, respectively, had mixed infections. Median log values of DNA equivalents/g of faeces for L. intracellularis, B. hyodysenteriae and B. pilosicoli were 3.3, 5.9 and 3.2, with maxima of 8.3, 8.0 and 6.3, respectively. Within herd prevalence of B. hyodysenteriae and B. pilosicoli as well as the load of B. hyodysenteriae were significantly associated with the severity of diarrhoea.
TI  - The use of quantitative PCR for identification and quantification of Brachyspira  pilosicoli, Lawsonia intracellularis and Escherichia coli fimbrial types F4 and F18 in pig feces.
AB  - Four quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays were evaluated for quantitative detection of  Brachyspira pilosicoli, Lawsonia intracellularis, and E. coli fimbrial types F4 and F18 in pig feces. Standard curves were based on feces spiked with the respective reference strains. The detection limits from the spiking experiments were 10(2) bacteria/g feces for Bpilo-qPCR and Laws-qPCR, 10(3)CFU/g feces for F4-qPCR and F18-qPCR. The PCR efficiency for all four qPCR assays was between 0.91 and 1.01 with R(2) above 0.993. Standard curves, slopes and elevation, varied between assays and between measurements from pure DNA from reference strains and feces spiked with the respective strains. The linear ranges found for spiked fecal samples differed both from the linear ranges from pure culture of the reference strains and between the qPCR tests. The linear ranges were five log units for F4-qPCR, and Laws-qPCR, six log units for F18-qPCR and three log units for Bpilo-qPCR in spiked feces. When measured on pure DNA from the reference strains used in spiking experiments, the respective log ranges were: seven units for Bpilo-qPCR, Laws-qPCR and F18-qPCR and six log units for F4-qPCR. This shows the importance of using specific standard curves, where each pathogen is analysed in the same matrix as sample DNA. The qPCRs were compared to traditional bacteriological diagnostic methods and found to be more sensitive than cultivation for E. coli and B. pilosicoli. The qPCR assay for Lawsonia was also more sensitive than the earlier used method due to improvements in DNA extraction. In addition, as samples were not analysed for all four pathogen agents by traditional diagnostic methods, many samples were found positive for agents that were not expected on the basis of age and case history. The use of quantitative PCR tests for diagnosis of enteric diseases provides new possibilities for veterinary diagnostics. The parallel simultaneous analysis for several bacteria in multi-qPCR and the determination of the quantities of the infectious agents increases the information obtained from the samples and the chance for obtaining a relevant diagnosis.
TI  - A multiplex real-time PCR for the simultaneous detection and quantitation of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, Brachyspira pilosicoli and Lawsonia intracellularis in pig faeces.
AB  - A multiplex real-time PCR assay was developed to detect and quantify B. hyodysenteriae, B. pilosicoli, and L. intracellularis in pig faeces. Specific probes and primers were directed against the NADH oxidase (nox) gene of Brachyspira and the aspartate ammonia lyase (aspA) gene of L. intracellularis, respectively. The analytical sensitivity for the real-time PCR assay, expressed as limit of detection (LOD) was below 10 DNA copies for L. intracellularis, 14 DNA copies for B. pilosicoli and 26 DNA copies per PCR reaction for B. hyodysenteriae. The experimental sensitivity, expressed as limit of quantitation (LOQ) for the real-time PCR assay was set to 100 DNA copies per PCR reaction which equals 8 x 10(3) cells per gram of faeces. The multiplex real-time PCR was tested in parallel to conventional PCR on 749 faecal samples from 121 farms. 73 (9.7%), 30 (4%), and 30 (4%) faecal samples were positive for L. intracellularis, B. hyodysenteriae, and B. pilosicoli, respectively by conventional PCR and 59 (7.9%), 27 (3.6%), and 7 (0.9%) by multiplex real-time PCR. From the real-time PCR positive results 34 (4.5%), 25 (3.3%), and 4 (0.5%) were above the LOQ. The multiplex real-time PCR will allow rapid and quantitative detection of clinical relevant amounts of the three key porcine enteric pathogens simultaneously.
TI  - Detection of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, Lawsonia intracellularis and Brachyspira pilosicoli in feral pigs.
AB  - Feral pigs are recognized as being a potential reservoir of pathogenic microorganisms that can infect domestic pigs and other species. The aim of this study was to investigate whether feral pigs in Western Australia were colonized by the pathogenic enteric bacteria Lawsonia intracellularis, Brachyspira hyodysenteriae and/or Brachyspira pilosicoli. A total of 222 feral pigs from three study-populations were sampled. DNA was extracted from faeces or colonic contents and subjected to a previously described multiplex PCR for the three pathogenic bacterial species. A subset of 61 samples was cultured for Brachyspira species. A total of 42 (18.9%) of the 222 samples were PCR positive for L. intracellularis, 18 (8.1%) for B. hyodysenteriae and 1 (0.45%) for B. pilosicoli. Four samples were positive for both L. intracellularis and B. hyodysenteriae. Samples positive for the latter two pathogens were found in pigs from all three study-sites. A strongly haemolytic B. hyodysenteriae isolate was recovered from one of the 61 cultured samples. Comparison of a 1250-base pair region of the 16S rRNA gene amplified from DNA extracted from the isolate and five of the B. hyodysenteriae PCR positive faecal samples helped confirm these as being from B. hyodysenteriae. This is the first time that B. hyodysenteriae has been detected in feral pigs. As these animals range over considerable distances, they present a potential source of B. hyodysenteriae for any domesticated pigs with which they may come into contact.
TI  - Development and validation of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the diagnosis of porcine proliferative enteropathy.
AB  - The objective of this study was to develop an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a sonicated pure culture of Lawsonia intracellularis as the antigen (So-ELISA). A total of 332 serum samples, consisting of 232 experimentally infected animals and 100 animals naturally infected with L. intracellularis, were used to assess the diagnostic sensitivity. Three hundred and fifty-five sera from uninfected animals were used to determine the diagnostic specificity. The receiver operating characteristic and mean +3 standard deviation of optical density (OD) values from uninfected animals were used for selecting cut-off points. The diagnostic accuracy of So-ELISA was considered to be high as the area under the curve index was 0.991 with 0.0029 standard error. The optimal cut-off for So-ELISA was set at 0.45 OD with 89.8% sensitivity and 99.4% specificity based on a combination of good sensitivity and high specificity. No cross-reactivity was found in sera from pigs exposed to Brachyspira pilosicoli, B. hyodysenteriae, Campylobacter mucosalis, C. jejuni, or C. coli. Inter- and intracoefficient of variation of all control sera tested with So-ELISA was less than 10%. The observed agreements between So-ELISA and the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay tested with experimental challenge animals and field samples were 95.08% with 0.88 kappa and 90.65% with 0.74 kappa value, respectively. So-ELISA was able to detect the seroconversion of infected animals at 2 to 4 weeks after exposure to L. intracellularis. Based on the validation results, So-ELISA could be used as an alternative serology for proliferative enteropathy diagnosis.
TI  - Simultaneous detection of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, Brachyspira pilosicoli and  Lawsonia intracellularis in porcine faeces and tissue samples by multiplex-PCR.
AB  - Diarrhoea in growing and finishing pigs is usually caused by infectious agents and laboratory diagnosis is a prerequisite for efficient therapy. Cultivation of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae or Brachyspira pilosicoli and detection of Lawsonia intracellularis by means of immunofluorescence tests (IFT) are time-consuming and in some cases lack sensitivity. A multiplex-PCR was designed to detect simultaneously these three pathogens in faeces and tissue samples, allowing the differential diagnosis of dysentery, intestinal spirochaetosis and proliferative enteropathy. Detection limits for B. hyodysenteriae, B. pilosicoli and L. intracellularis were 10(4), 10(2) and 10(3) copies respectively. Agreement between multiplex-PCR and nested-PCR or cultivation was considered substantial to almost perfect. Agreement between multiplex-PCR and IFT in detecting L. intracellularis was only moderate, which was probably related to false-positive results given by IFT. The multiplex-PCR described herein is a valuable tool for the rapid and simultaneous detection of three different pathogens in porcine samples causing enteric diseases.
TI  - Prevalence of selected enteropathogenic bacteria in Hungarian finishing pigs.
AB  - The aim of this study was to obtain prevalence estimates about the most important enteropathogenic bacteria: Lawsonia intracellularis, Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, Brachyspira pilosicoli, Salmonella enterica and Clostridium perfringens A and C in Hungarian farrow-to-finish pig herds. A total of 31 herds were selected, from where six pooled faecal samples, each containing three individual rectal faecal samples were collected from fattening pigs of 5-6 months of age. All 186 samples were examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of the pathogens mentioned above. Lawsonia intracellularis was found in 29 herds (93.55%) and in 108 samples (58.06%); B. hyodysenteriae in 14 herds (45.16%) and in 23 samples (12.37%); B. pilosicoli in 19 herds (61.29%) and in 53 samples (28.49%); S. enterica in 17 herds (54.83%) and in 40 samples (21.50%). We detected the presence of C. perfringens A in 19 herds (61.29%) and in 46 samples (24.73%), while C. perfringens C was found in 8 herds (25.81%) and in 11 samples (5.91%). All examined herds were infected with one or more of these agents. Herds with diarrhoea in the mid- to late finishing phase had almost 10 times higher prevalence of B. hyodysenteriae than herds without such a history.
TI  - Survey on the occurrence of Brachyspira species and Lawsonia intracellularis in children living on pig farms.
AB  - The occurrence of Brachyspira species and Lawsonia intracellularis was investigated by PCR analyses of faeces from 60 children living on European pig farms. In addition, 60 other children were included as controls. Two samples were positive for B. aalborgi but B. pilosicoli and L. intracellularis were not demonstrated.
TI  - Development of a multiplex-PCR for rapid detection of the enteric pathogens Lawsonia intracellularis, Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, and Brachyspira pilosicoli in porcine faeces.
AB  - AIMS: To develop an assay to simultaneously detect Lawsonia intracellularis, Brachyspira hyodysenteriae and Brachyspira pilosicoli in pig faeces. METHODS AND RESULTS: A multiplex-polymerase chain reaction (M-PCR) was designed to amplify a 655-base pair (bp) portion of the L. intracellularis 16S rRNA gene, a 354-bp portion of the B. hyodysenteriae NADH oxidase gene, and a 823-bp portion of the B. pilosicoli 16S rRNA gene. Specificity was assessed using 80 strains of Brachyspira spp. and 30 other enteric bacteria. Bacterial DNA was extracted from faeces using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit. The M-PCR was tested in parallel with culture and/or PCR on 192 faecal samples from eight piggeries. Faeces also were seeded with known cell concentrations of the three pathogenic species, and the limits of detection of the M-PCR tested. The M-PCR was specific, with limits of detection of 10(2)-10(3) cells of the respective species per gram of faeces. CONCLUSIONS: The M-PCR is a rapid, sensitive and specific test for detecting three important enteric bacterial pathogens of pigs. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The availability of a new diagnostic M-PCR will allow rapid detection and control of three key porcine enteric pathogens.
TI  - Neither hippurate-negative Brachyspira pilosicoli nor Brachyspira pilosicoli type strain caused diarrhoea in early-weaned pigs by experimental infection.
AB  - A hippurate-negative biovariant of Brachyspira pilosicoli (B. pilosicolihipp-) is occasionally isolated in diarrhoeic pigs in Finland, often concomitantly with hippurate-positive B. pilosicoli or Lawsonia intracellularis. We studied pathogenicity of B. pilosicolihipp- with special attention paid to avoiding co-infection with other enteric pathogens. Pigs were weaned and moved to barrier facilities at the age of 11 days. At 46 days, 8 pigs were inoculated with B. pilosicolihipp- strain Br1622, 8 pigs were inoculated with B. pilosicoli type strain P43/6/78 and 7 pigs were sham-inoculated. No signs of spirochaetal diarrhoea were detected; only one pig, inoculated with P43/6/78, had soft faeces from day 9 to 10 post inoculation. The pigs were necropsied between days 7 and 23 after inoculation. Live pigs were culture-negative for Brachyspira spp., but B. pilosicolihipp- was reisolated from necropsy samples of two pigs. The lesions on large colons were minor and did not significantly differ between the three trial groups. In silver-stained sections, invasive spirochaetes were detected in colonic mucosae of several pigs in all groups. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation for genus Brachyspira, B. pilosicoli and strain Br1622 was negative. However, in situ detection for members of the genus Leptospira was positive for spirochaete-like bacteria in the colonic epithelium of several pigs in both infected groups as well as in the control group. L. intracellularis, Salmonella spp., Yersinia spp. and intestinal parasites were not detected. The failure of B. pilosicoli strains to cause diarrhoea is discussed with respect to infectivity of the challenge strains, absence of certain intestinal pathogens and feed and management factors.
TI  - The prevalences of Brachyspira spp. and Lawsonia intracellularis in Swedish piglet producing herds and wild boar population.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to survey the prevalences of the enteric pathogens Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, Brachyspira pilosicoli and Lawsonia intracellularis in Swedish growing pigs and in the Swedish wild boar population and to relate these findings to clinical signs. The study included 105 randomly selected herds, constituting approximately one third of Swedish herds with a herd size of >100 sows. The herds were located all over the country. In these herds, growth promoters were not used and pigs sampled were not subjected to any medication. From each herd, samples were taken from 10 growing pigs aged 8-12 weeks, corresponding to approximately 2.5% of all growing pigs present in the herd at the sampling occasion. If possible, the samples were taken from pigs with diarrhoea. Forty-eight faecal samples and 71 rectal swabs were also taken from free-living wild boars (31 piglets, 19 growers and 21 adult animals) at shooting. The samples were analysed by culture and biochemical tests for the presence of Brachyspira spp. and by nested PCR for the presence of L. intracellularis. Brachyspira hyodysenteriae was not demonstrated in any sample. Brachyspira intermedia was detected in 22 samples originating from 15 herds, Brachyspira innocens/Brachyspira murdochii was detected in 370 samples from 82 herds and B. pilosicoli was detected in 134 samples originating from 34 herds. In 21 herds and in 534 samples, no Brachyspira spp. were detected. Lawsonia intracellularis was demonstrated in 285 samples from 50 herds. Further, 418 samples from conventional herds were negative with respect to L. intracellularis and in 345 samples the PCR had been inhibited. All samples from the wild boars were negative for Brachyspira spp., 12 of 48 samples were negative for L. intracellularis, and in 36 wild boar samples, the PCR was inhibited.
TI  - Amplification and sequencing of Brachyspira spp. specific portions of nox using paraffin-embedded tissue samples from clinical colitis in Austrian pigs shows frequent solitary presence of Brachyspiramurdochii.
AB  - Brachyspira infections are significant causes of enterocolitis in pigs. In order  to differentiate pathogenic species (Brachyspira (Br.) hyodysenteriae, Brachyspira pilosicoli) from less pathogenic or non-pathogenic species (Brachyspira intermedia, Brachyspira innocens, Brachyspira murdochii) in paraffin-embedded tissue samples a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol allowing identification of Brachyspira at species level in archival material was developed. This approach was complemented by sequencing of the PCR amplification products. All seven cases presented with clinical and morphological Brachyspira-associated enterocolitis. Br. hyodysenteriae was not identified in any of the cases, while Br. pilosicoli was identified in a single case in conjunction with Br. murdochii. One case each was found positive for Br. innocens and Br. intermedia. Interestingly, the majority of cases presented as single or double infections with Br. murdochii. In some of the pigs other pathogens, like porcine circovirus-2 or Lawsonia intracellularis were present. These observations point at the possibility that under certain conditions even Brachyspira species of low pathogenicity can multiplicate extensively and lead to Brachyspira-associated enterocolitis.
TI  - Postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome--PMWS. the first year with the disease in Sweden.
AB  - Postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) is causally associated with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infection of pigs. PCV2 has been present in the Swedish pig population for at least ten years. Despite this, no signs of PMWS were observed in pigs of Sweden until 2003. Since then the disease has spread slowly in Sweden. The pig population of Sweden is geographically isolated, the density of pigs and the pathogen load in the country is low and the trade of animals is organised in a restricted way. To date, there has been little information placed in the peer-reviewed literature on the study of the spread of PMWS in a country during the early phase of the disease outbreak, mainly because diagnosis of PMWS has only occurred after the disease has been recognised on a number of farms. This manuscript documents the studies to date on the PMWS outbreak in Sweden which has been closely monitored since the initial outbreak of diseases on a single farm in 2003 was diagnosed. In Sweden PMWS was officially reported for the first time at a progeny test station during December 2003. One year later sixteen herds have been diagnosed and reported to the authorities: one progeny test station, one nucleus herd, thirteen piglet producers or integrated herds and one specialised fattening herd. Fifteen suspected cases have been deemed negative for PMWS with disease scenarios associated with Lawsonia intracellularis, Brachyspira pilosicoli, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, shortcomings in feed composition etc. To date, one year after the index case was reported ten other herds suspected for PMWS are under observation. The PMWS cases are concentrated into the southern part of Sweden. However, the disease is spreading slowly, and in general there are no obvious physical links between affected herds. The data generated to date in Sweden suggest that introduction of a new contagious microbe into the country that is responsible for the PMWS outbreaks appears unlikely, as does the spread of PMWS via semen.
TI  - Occurrence of Lawsonia Intracellularis and Brachyspira spp. infection in swine suffering from diarrhoea.
AB  - Principal aim of this study was to examine fecal samples from pigs suffering from diarrhea for the presence of Lawsonia intracellularis, Brachyspira hyodysenteriae and Brachyspira pilosicoli. The molecular techniques such as PCR and nested PCR were employed to detect the presence of p78 fragment of genomic DNA specific for Lawsonia intracellularis as well as fragment of tlyA gene specific for Brachyspira hyodysenteriae and 16S rDNA gene of Brachyspira pilosicoli. We assumed that about 25% of pigs were infected with Lawsonia intracellularis, about 10% with Brachyspira hyodysenteriae and only 0,8% with Brachyspira pilosicoli. In about 3% mixed infection with L. intracellularis and B. hyodysenteriae was observed. Results were comparable in herds that differed in quantity, breeding technology, hygienic standards and preventive treatment with different chemotherapeutics.
TI  - Diarrhoea in the growing pig - a comparison of clinical, morphological and microbial findings between animals from good and poor performance herds.
AB  - Diarrhoea among growing pigs (8-13 weeks old) is a significant problem in many herds. Nine herds with poor performance and diarrhoea among growing pigs were selected on the basis of their piglet mean age at a body weight of 25 kg, compared to the overall mean age in Swedish herds. In addition, four herds with good average performance and no problems with diarrhoea were selected. Pigs were necropsied and samples for histology and microbiology were collected. Based on the necropsy findings, the pigs from the good performing herds were all judged to be healthy. The presence of Brachyspira pilosicoli and Lawsonia intracellularis was significantly correlated to poor performing herds and the results indicate that these microbes are main pathogens involved in enteric diseases among Swedish grower pigs. In addition, concomitant infections with other presumptive pathogens were commonly found.
TI  - Validation of an immunoperoxidase monolayer assay as a serologic test for porcine proliferative enteropathy.
AB  - The sensitivity and specificity of an immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) was evaluated in a blind serologic study of a group of disease-free pigs and a group of pigs experimentally infected with intestinal homogenate containing Lawsonia intracellularis organisms. Sixty pigs from the control group were kept in the source farm, and another 60 animals were transferred to an isolation unit aid challenged intragastrically. All animals were bled before and 21 days after challenge. Fecal samples were collected on the same dates. The IPMA results were tested for sensitivity and specificity in a 2 x 2 table using the challenged and nonchallenged status as gold standard. Sensitivity and specificity were evaluated for different cutoff points (serum dilutions). Specificities of 100% were obtained for all the serum dilutions tested (1:15, 1:30, 1:60, and 1:120). The sensitivity levels were 90.7%, 88.9%, 81.5%, and 75.9% for the serum dilutions 1:15, 1:30, 1:60, and 1:120, respectively. The sensitivity of the dilution 1:15 was slightly, but not significantly, higher than the dilution currently used as the cutoff point (1:30). Cross-reactivity of the IPMA test was evaluated using sera from pigs experimentally inoculated with Brachyspira pilosicoli and various Campylobacter species. All these samples were negative. Sera samples from 3 porcine proliferative enteropathy known negative populations, 40 growing pigs from 2 commercial farms and a group of 6 cesarean-derived and colostrum-deprived pigs, also tested negative by IPMA. The IPMA serologic test with the cutoff point of 1:30 showed specificity of 100% and sensitivity close to 90% and, therefore, is an appropriate diagnostic test for herd screening but not for diagnosing PPE on the individual level.
TI  - Porcine enteric spirochete infections in the UK: surveillance data and preliminary investigation of atypical isolates.
AB  - Investigations into the possible causes of colitis and typhlocolitis were carried out on 98 pig units in the United Kingdom between 1997 and 1999. Brachyspira pilosicoli was identified most commonly, occurring as the suggested primary agent in 18% of the outbreaks but forming part of mixed infections in another 24% of outbreaks. The equivalent figures for other bacterial pathogens were: B. hyodysenteriae, 13% and 16%; Lawsonia intracellularis, 10% and 15%: Salmonella species, 6% and 12%; and Yersinia species, 4% and 10%. Unclassified Brachyspira species of unknown pathogenicity were identified in 12% of outbreaks. The 24 unclassified isolates divided into three groups on the basis of their phenotypic characteristics. In addition, there were 50 atypical Brachyspira species isolates that showed differences between their phenotypic characteristics and genetic identity based on sequence analysis of a section of the 23S rDNA gene. Four representative atypical isolates were found to be pathogenic as a result of an experimental oral challenge study in pigs.
TI  - Risk factors for intestinal pathogens in Danish finishing pig herds.
AB  - The objective of this investigation was to identify risk factors for infection with the intestinal bacteria: Lawsonia intracellularis, Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, Serpulina intermedia, Brachyspira innocens, Brachyspira pilosicoli and swine-pathogenic Escherichia coli (serogroups O138, O139, O141 and O149) in Danish finishing pig herds.A total of 79 herds was randomly selected and visited during 1998. From each herd, 20 faecal samples were collected from individual pigs weighing 30-50 kg. In total, 1580 faecal samples were collected and examined by polymerase chain reaction (L. intracellularis) or culture (all other agents). Information on feed and management procedures was collected by filling in questionnaires at the herd visits. The questionnaires included information on 29 dichotomous variables and three continuous variables. Variables with P<0.25 in a preliminary screening (chi2- or t-test) were selected for the statistical modelling. Our conclusions, based on the results of multifactorial logistic regression (cut-off: P=0.05), were the following: 1. Consistent batch production was associated with reduced prevalences of L. intracellularis and weakly -haemolytic spirochetes (S. intermedia, B. innocens, B. pilosicoli) (OR's=0.43 and 0.06, respectively). 2. Home-mixed (and/or non-pelleted) feed was associated with reduced prevalences of L. intracellularis and weakly -haemolytic spirochetes (OR's=0.6 and 0.4, respectively). 3. Providing straw to finishers was associated with a reduced prevalence of weakly -haemolytic spirochetes (OR=0.28-0.32). 4. Not using antimicrobial growth promoters for piglets was associated with an increased prevalence of S. intermedia (OR=11.11). 5. Rare occurrence of post-weaning diarrhoea (as opposed to common) was associated with an increased prevalence of weakly -haemolytic spirochetes (OR=8.3-13.7).
TI  - An investigation of the etiology of a mild diarrhea observed in a group of grower/finisher pigs.
AB  - An investigation into a mild diarrhea in a group of grower/finisher pigs was carried out in order to determine the etiology. A tiamulin injection and a carbadox-medicated ration were given to pens of pigs in a 2 x 2 factorial experimental design. Pens of pigs were assessed a score, based on the consistency of the feces in the pen, each week. The clinical investigation looked for the intestinal pathogens Brachyspira pilosicoli, B. hyodysenteriae, Lawsonia intracellularis, Salmonella spp., Yersinia spp., transmissible gastroenteritis virus, and rotavirus. Despite a rigorous investigation, the diarrhea was not attributed to any pathogen. A mild colitis was noted among pigs necropsied while affected with diarrhea. Improved diagnostic tools may allow a more effective response to an outbreak of mild disease, while at the same time reducing the amount of antimicrobials used in swine production.
TI  - Prevalence of intestinal pathogens in Danish finishing pig herds.
AB  - Our aim was to determine the prevalence of the intestinal bacteria: Lawsonia intracellularis, Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, Serpulina intermedia, Brachyspira innocens, Brachyspira pilosicoli, pathogenic Escherichia coli (serogroups O138, O139, O141 and O149) and Salmonella enterica in Danish finishing pig herds. A total of 79 herds was randomly selected and visited during 1998. From each herd, 20 faecal samples were collected from individual pigs weighing 30-50kg. Furthermore, 10 pooled pen samples were collected and examined for S. enterica. In total, 1580 faecal samples and 790 pen samples were collected and examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or culture. L. intracellularis was found in 74 herds (93.7%), B. hyodysenteriae in two herds (2.5%), S. intermedia in 10 herds (12. 7%), B. innocens in 27 herds (34.2%), B. pilosicoli in 15 herds (19. 0%), pathogenic E. coli in 19 herds (24.1%) and S. enterica in eight herds (10.1%). The within-herd prevalences of L. intracellularis and B. hyodysenteriae were 25-30%; the within-herd prevalences of the other agents were 5-10%. Three herds (4%) were not infected with any of the bacteria and 25 herds (32%) were only infected with L. intracellularis.
TI  - Comparative pathology of bacterial enteric diseases of swine.
AB  - Enteric bacterial infections are among the most common and economically significant diseases affecting swine production worldwide. Clinical signs of these infections include diarrhea, reduced growth rate, weight loss, and death of preweaned, weanling, grower-finisher, young and adult age breeding animals. The most common etiological agents include Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Lawsonia intracellularis, Salmonella enterica, and Brachyspira (Serpulina) spp. With the exception of Brachyspira (Serpulina) hyodysenteriae, the cause of swine dysentery, and Lawsonia intracellularis, the cause of proliferative enteropathy, the pathological changes seen with these agents closely resemble the diseases occurring in human beings. Histological changes in the intestines of swine with enteric bacterial infections include bacterial colonization without significant damage (e.g., certain enterotoxigenic E. coli and C. perfringens type A), attaching and effacing lesions with enteropathogenic E. coli and Brachyspira pilosicoli, the cause of colonic spirochetosis, inflammation with S. enterica, and necrotizing and hemorrhagic lesions with certain C. perfringens. Extraintestinal spread of bacteria and/or toxins occurs with some serotypes of E. coli and most serotypes of S. enterica. Enteric bacterial diseases of swine have been used as models to study the pathogenesis of similar diseases of human beings. Several of these pathogens are also important causes of food-borne disease in humans.
TI  - Detection of Lawsonia intracellularis, Serpulina hyodysenteriae, weakly beta-haemolytic intestinal spirochaetes, Salmonella enterica, and haemolytic Escherichia coli from swine herds with and without diarrhoea among growing pigs.
AB  - A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was optimized to detect Lawsonia intracellularis in faeces from naturally infected pigs. By combining a boiling procedure to extract DNA and a nested PCR procedure, a detection limit at 2 x 10(2) bacterial cells per gram of faeces was achieved. The optimized PCR was used together with conventional culture techniques to detect Serpulina hyodysenteriae, weakly beta-haemolytic intestinal spirochaetes (WBHIS), Salmonella enterica, and haemolytic Escherichia coli, in a case control study to examine selected risk factors for the development of diarrhoea in growing pigs. Herds with diarrhoea were selected as cases and randomly chosen herds without diarrhoea were chosen as controls. Infection with L. intracellularis significantly enhanced the chance of diarrhoea. S. hyodysenteriae, WBHIS group IV (Serpulina pilosicoli), and S. enterica were isolated only from case herds which indicate that these species may influence the development of diarrhoea. In addition, herd-type had a significant impact, that is specific pathogen-free herds showed an odds ratio at 0.2 relative to conventional herds for the development of diarrhoea.
TI  - Investigations into field cases of porcine colitis with particular reference to infection with Serpulina pilosicoli.
AB  - Investigations into the possible causes of colitis and typhlocolitis were carried out on 85 pig units in the United Kingdom between 1992 and 1996. Serpulina pilosicoli was identified most commonly, occurring as the suggested primary agent on 21 (25 per cent) of the units but forming part of mixed infections on another 23 (27 per cent) of the units, the main co-infections being Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (eight units), proliferative enteropathy (six units), Salmonella species (four units) or Serpulina hyodysenteriae (two units). 'Atypical' Serpulina species, S hyodysenteriae, Salmonella typhimurium, Y pseudotuberculosis and Lawsonia intracellularis (proliferative enteropathy) were the suggested primary agents on seven, six, four, four and three units, respectively. Various combinations of mixed infections involving the latter organisms and other possibly incidental agents were recorded on another 10 units. Investigations on a further six units failed to detect any recognised pathogens. On units where S pilosicoli was the suggested primary agent, pigs ranging between 20 to 40 kg (eight to 16 weeks of age), but occasionally up to 50 kg, had diarrhoea and grew poorly over a period of two to three weeks. The prevalence was estimated to be between 5 and 15 per cent in affected batches, with a mortality of approximately 1 per cent. The clinical signs usually developed seven to 14 days after the moving and mixing of pigs. At postmortem examination, affected pigs had liquid contents in their colon, which contained accumulations of mucus in some chronic cases. Gross and histological lesions of colitis were prominent in the mid-spiral region of the colon. In mixed infections with Y pseudotuberculosis, Salmonella typhimurium or S hyodysenteriae, lesions were more extensive and affected the caecum as well as the colon. In the colon, lesions of proliferative enteropathy were usually confined to the proximal half of the ascending spiral but mixed infection with S pilosicoli caused more extensive colitis. Mixed infections were reported to prolong the time taken for pigs to recover naturally and to have a more detrimental effect on growth rates than S pilosicoli infection alone. Despite the successful treatment of batches of pigs with tiamulin or lincomycin, S pilosicoli infection persisted as a chronic problem on many units, with diarrhoea and colitis in successive batches of pigs unless prophylactic medication was used.
