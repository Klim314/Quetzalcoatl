TI  == prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among clinical isolates of bacteroides fragilis group in canada in 2010-2011: canward surveillance study.
AB  == clinical isolates of the bacteroides fragilis group (n = 387) were collected from patients attending nine canadian hospitals in 2010-2011 and tested for susceptibility to 10 antimicrobial agents using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method. b. fragilis (59.9%), bacteroides ovatus (16.3%), and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (12.7%) accounted for ~90% of isolates collected. overall rates of percent susceptibility were as follows: 99.7%, metronidazole; 99.5%, piperacillin-tazobactam; 99.2%, imipenem; 97.7%, ertapenem; 92.0%, doripenem; 87.3%, amoxicillin-clavulanate; 80.9%, tigecycline; 65.9%, cefoxitin; 55.6%, moxifloxacin; and 52.2%, clindamycin. percent susceptibility to cefoxitin, clindamycin, and moxifloxacin was lowest for b. thetaiotaomicron (n = 49, 24.5%), parabacteroides distasonis/p. merdae (n = 11, 9.1%), and b. ovatus (n = 63, 31.8%), respectively. one isolate (b. thetaiotaomicron) was resistant to metronidazole, and two isolates (both b. fragilis) were resistant to both piperacillin-tazobactam and imipenem. since the  last published surveillance study describing canadian isolates of b. fragilis group almost 20 years ago (a.-m. bourgault et al., antimicrob. agents chemother.  36:343-347, 1992), rates of resistance have increased for amoxicillin-clavulanate, from 0.8% (1992) to 6.2% (2010-2011), and for clindamycin, from 9% (1992) to 34.1% (2010-2011).

TI  == application of quantitative real-time pcr for rapid identification of bacteroides fragilis group and related organisms in human wound samples.
AB  == our goal was to establish a quantitative real-time pcr (qrt-pcr) method to detect bacteroides fragilis group and related organisms from clinical specimens. compared to conventional anaerobic culture, qrt-pcr can provide accurate and more rapid detection and identification of b. fragilis group and similar species. b. fragilis group and related organisms are the most frequently isolated anaerobic pathogens from clinical samples. however, culture and phenotypic identification is quite time-consuming. we designed specific primers and probes based on the 16s rrna gene sequences of bacteroides caccae, bacteroides eggerthii, b. fragilis, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides stercoris, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis, bacteroides vulgatus, odoribacter splanchnicus (bacteroides splanchnicus), parabacteroides distasonis (bacteroides distasonis) and parabacteroides merdae (bacteroides merdae), and detected these species by means of qrt-pcr in 400 human surgical wound infection samples or closed abscesses. the target bacteria were detected from 31 samples (8%) by culture, but from 132 samples (33%) by qrt-pcr (p-value < 0.001). b. uniformis was the most common species (44 positive samples) according to qrt-pcr while culture showed it to be b. fragilis (16 positive samples). additionally, for each species qrt-pcr detected higher counts than culture did; this may reflect detecting dna of dead organisms by qrt-pcr. qrt-pcr is a rapid and sensitive method which has great potential for detection of b. fragilis group and related organisms in wound samples.
