TI  - Nationwide surveillance of 6 otorhinolaryngological infectious diseases and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in the isolated pathogens in Japan.
AB  - The Japanese Three Academic Societies Joint Antimicrobial Susceptibility Surveillance Committee has conducted a nationwide surveillance on antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and rates of isolation in 6 otolaryngological diseases. The surveillance program was conducted in the otorhinolaryngological departments of 29 universities, and their 26 affiliated hospitals. Patients suffering from acute otitis media, chronic otitis media, acute nasal sinusitis, chronic nasal sinusitis, acute tonsillitis, and peritonsillar abscess between January 2011 and June 2012 were investigated. The collected swab or incision samples were cultivated for microbial identification, and the drug susceptibility of detected bacteria was measured at the Kitasato University Research Center for Infections and Antimicrobials. The surveillance focused on three gram-positive bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus), three gram-negative bacteria (Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella Catarrhalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three anaerobic bacteria (Peptostreptococcus spp., Prevotella spp., and Fusobacterium spp.). Bacterial susceptibility to 39 antimicrobial drugs was investigated. We compared bacterial isolation ratio of each disease in this surveillance from those of past 4 times surveillance which we performed formerly, and we also compared percentage of main drug resistant strains from those of past 4 times surveillance. The age composition between this time and former surveillances was not statistically significant by student-t test. We were unable to completely resolve the rise in resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase non-producing ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae, beta-lactamase producing ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae, and beta-lactamase producing amoxicillin clavulanic acid-resistant H. influenzae. We suggest promoting the proper usage of antimicrobial drugs in order to avoid the spread of these bacteria.
TI  - Bacteriology of deep neck infections: analysis of 634 patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to review the bacteriology of deep neck infections (DNI) and identify the factors that influence the incidence of causative bacteria. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 634 patients with DNI was performed. Statistical analysis was used to compare the incidence of common pathogens in various conditions such as age of the patients, aetiology and associated diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: Bacteria were isolated in 514 cultures (81%). Aerobic bacteria were isolated from 246 cultures (39%) and anaerobic bacteria from 61 cultures (10%). Both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 207 cultures (32%). The most common aerobic bacteria were Streptococcus pyogenes (41%) and Staphylococcus aureus (32%). The most common anaerobic bacteria were Peptostreptococcus species (28%), followed by Prevotela species (8%) and Proprionibacterium species (7%). The incidence of anaerobic bacteria was higher in adults, in patients with infections of dental origin and in non-diabetic patients. CONCLUSIONS: The bacteriology of DNI is polymicrobial, including both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The incidence of anaerobic bacteria is higher in adults, in patients with infections of dental origin and in non-diabetic patients.
TI  - [Oral microbiocenosis features of diabetic patients after orthopedic treatment with various types of crowns].
AB  - The article gives a detailed analysis of oral cavity microbiocenosis features of  36 patients with type II diabetes for 5 years. These data reflects microbiocenosis features before and after orthopedic treatment with metal-ceramic and pressed crowns. These results indicate that frequency of occurrence and the number of microorganisms of the genus Streptococcus, Staphylococcus (including S. aureus), Peptostreptococcus and Candida is significantly higher in patients after orthopedic treatment with pressed crowns than with metal-ceramic crowns. A high percentage of normal microflora, particularly lactobacilli (60%), was revealed on gingival mucosa in patients after orthopedic treatment with metal-ceramic crowns.
TI  - Development and pyrosequencing analysis of an in-vitro oral biofilm model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dental caries and periodontal disease are the commonest bacterial diseases of man and can result in tooth loss. The principal method of prevention is the mechanical removal of dental plaque augmented by active agents incorporated into toothpastes and mouthrinses. In-vitro assays that include complex oral bacterial biofilms are required to accurately predict the efficacy of novel active agents in vivo. The aim of this study was to develop an oral biofilm model using the Calgary biofilm device (CBD) seeded with a natural saliva inoculum and analysed by next generation sequencing. The specific objectives were to determine the reproducibility and stability of the model by comparing the composition of the biofilms over time derived from (i) the same volunteers at different time points, and (ii) different panels of volunteers. RESULTS: Pyrosequencing yielded 280,093 sequences with a mean length of 432 bases after filtering. A mean of 320 and 250 OTUs were detected in pooled saliva and biofilm samples, respectively. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) plots based on community membership and structure showed that replicate biofilm samples were highly similar and clustered together. In addition, there were no significant differences between biofilms derived from the same panel at different times using analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA). There were significant differences between biofilms from different panels (AMOVA, P < 0.002). PCoA revealed that there was a shift in biofilm composition between seven and 14 days (AMOVA, P < 0.001). Veillonella parvula, Veillonella atypica/dispar/parvula and Peptostreptococcus stomatis were the predominant OTUs detected in seven-day biofilms, whilst Prevotella oralis, V. parvula and Streptococcus constellatus were predominant in 14-day biofilms. CONCLUSIONS: Diverse oral biofilms were successfully grown and maintained using the CBD. Biofilms derived from the same panel of volunteers were highly reproducible. This model could be used to screen both antimicrobial-containing oral care products and also novel approaches aiming to modify plaque composition, such as pre- or probiotics.
TI  - Intracranial bacterial infections of oral origin.
AB  - Brain abscesses are rare but potentially deadly complications of odontogenic infections. This phenomenon has been described mainly in the form of case reports, as large-scale studies are difficult to perform. We compiled a total of 60 previously published cases of such a complication to investigate the predisposing factors, microbiology, and clinical outcomes of intracranial abscesses of odontogenic origin. A systematic review of the literature using the PubMed database was performed. Men accounted for 82.1% of cases, and the mean age was 42.1 years. Caries with periapical involvement and periodontitis were the two most common intra-oral sources, and wisdom tooth extraction was the most common preceding dental procedure. In 56.4% of cases, there were obvious signs of dental disease prior to development of intracranial infection. Commonly implicated microorganisms included Streptococcus viridans (especially the anginosus group), Actinomyces, Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Eikenella corrodens. There was an 8.3% mortality rate. Intracranial abscesses can form anywhere within the brain, and appear unrelated to the side of dental involvement. This suggests that hematogenous spread is the most likely route of dissemination.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of preparation Bioaron C.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of sirupus Bioaron C, a preparation, whose main ingredient is an extract from the leaves of Aloe arborescens, was tested against different microorganisms isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections. The experiments were performed on 40 strains: 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria, 13 strains of aerobic bacteria and 7 strains of yeast-like fungi from the genus Candida and on 18 reference strains (ATCC). The antimicrobial activity of Bioaron C (MBC and MFC) was determined at undiluted concentration. Bioaron C proved to be very effective against the microorganisms causing infections. At the concentration recommended by the producer, the preparation showed biocidal activity (MBC, MFC) against the strains of the pathogenic microorganisms, which cause respiratory infections most frequently, including, among others, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Parvimonas micra, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus anginosus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, already after 15 min. The MIC of Bioaron C against most of the tested microorganisms was 5 to 100 times lower than the usually applied concentration. The great antimicrobial activity means that the preparation may be used in the prevention and treatment of infections of the upper respiratory tract. Bioaron C may be an alternative or complement to classical therapy, especially in children.
TI  - The presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity of one-year-old infants delivered pre-term with very low birthweights: a case control study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, the dental literature has focused mainly on the microbial colonization of healthy full-term infants and their mothers or caretakers. However, oral microbial acquisition by premature infants has not been adequately investigated, and the correlation between pre-term birth and the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens has not been determined. The aim of this study was to identify the presence and quantities of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavities of 12-month-old infants and compare the occurrence of these microbes between a cohort of pre-term infants with very low birthweights and a control cohort comprising full-term infants. METHODS: The research cohort was composed of 69 one-year-old infants, of whom 24 were born prematurely with very low birthweights and 45 of whom were carried to full term. Information regarding the infants' gestational age, mode of delivery, general health status, birthweight and antibiotic use were obtained from hospital records and through oral interviews. At 12 months of age, both groups of infants were examined, and unstimulated saliva samples from the dorsum of the tongue and dental plaque samples were collected. The microorganisms (Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus spp., Actinomyces spp., Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum) were identified and their quantities were evaluated using a PCR-based method. The chi-squared and Fisher's factorial tests were used for the statistical evaluations. RESULTS: The infants had a high prevalence of cariogenic microbes and of Fusosbacterium nucleatum and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. Cariogenic microbes were detected in 91.7% of the very low birthweight infants and in all full-term infants. Periodontal pathogens were present in 83% of the pre-term infants and in 96% of the full-term infants. A significant difference was found between the cohorts in terms of the presence of S. mutans. Most of the very low birthweight infants had negative values of this microbe, while the full-term infants had positive values. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the early transmission of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens to the oral cavity of one-year-old infants and a higher prevalence of S. mutans in full-term infants than in premature infants.
TI  - Purulent pericarditis after transbronchial biopsy.
AB  - A 28-year-old woman experienced hypotension and unresponsiveness. She had undergone bronchoscopy with needle biopsy 2 weeks before admission to evaluate hilar lymphadenopathy given suspicion of sarcoidosis. She had an elevated white blood cell count of 28,000/muL and a serum creatinine level of 4.0 mg/dL. Echocardiography showed a large pericardial effusion. Pericardiocentesis resulted in removal of 400 mL of yellow-green purulent material that grew Streptococcus milleri, Prevotella, Veillonella, and Peptostreptococcus species. Pericardiectomy and mediastinal washout were performed. Subsequently, her condition rapidly improved. She returned home after 26 days of admission. At 12-month follow-up, the patient had made a full recovery.
TI  - Changes in gastric and lung microflora with acid suppression: acid suppression and bacterial growth.
AB  - IMPORTANCE: The use of acid suppression has been associated with an increased risk of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in the outpatient setting but the mechanism behind this increased risk is unknown. We hypothesize that this infection risk results from gastric bacterial overgrowth with subsequent seeding of the lungs. OBJECTIVES: To determine if acid-suppression use results in gastric bacterial overgrowth, if there are changes in lung microflora associated with the use of acid suppression, and if changes in lung microflora are related to full-column nonacid gastroesophageal reflux. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 5-year prospective cohort study at a tertiary care center where children ages 1 to 18 years were undergoing bronchoscopy and endoscopy for the evaluation of chronic cough. Acid-suppression use was assessed through questionnaires with confirmation using an electronic medical record review. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Our primary outcome was to compare differences in concentration and prevalence of gastric and lung bacteria between patients who were and were not receiving acid-suppression therapy. We compared medians using the Wilcoxon signed rank test and determined prevalence ratios using asymptotic standard errors and 95% confidence intervals. We determined correlations between continuous variables using Pearson correlation coefficients and compared categorical variables using the Fisher exact test. RESULTS: Forty-six percent of patients taking acid-suppression medication had gastric bacterial growth compared with 18% of untreated patients (P = .003). Staphylococcus (prevalence ratio, 12.75 [95% CI, 1.72-94.36]), Streptococcus (prevalence ratio, 6.91 [95% CI, 1.64-29.02]), Veillonella (prevalence ratio, 9.56 [95% CI, 1.26-72.67]), Dermabacter (prevalence ratio, 4.78 [95% CI, 1.09-21.02]), and Rothia (prevalence ratio, 6.38 [95% CI, 1.50-27.02]) were found more commonly in the gastric fluid of treated patients. The median bacterial concentration was higher in treated patients than in untreated patients (P = .001). There was no difference in the prevalence (P > .23) of different bacterial genera or the median concentration of total bacteria (P = .85) in the lungs between treated and untreated patients. There were significant positive correlations between proximal nonacid reflux burden and lung concentrations of Bacillus (r = 0.47, P = .005), Dermabacter (r = 0.37, P = .008), Lactobacillus (r = 0.45, P = .001), Peptostreptococcus (r = 0.37, P = .008), and Capnocytophagia (r = 0.37, P = .008). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Acid-suppression use results in gastric bacterial overgrowth of genera including Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. Full-column nonacid reflux is associated with greater concentrations of bacteria in the lung. Additional studies are needed to determine if acid suppression-related microflora changes predict clinical infection risk; these results suggest that acid suppression use may need to be limited in patients at risk for infections.
TI  - Profiling of the bacteria responsible for pyogenic liver abscess by 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing.
AB  - Pyogenic liver abscess (PLA) is a severe disease with considerable mortality and  is often polymicrobial. Understanding the pathogens that cause PLA is the basis for PLA treatment. Here, we profiled the bacterial composition in PLA fluid by pyrosequencing the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to identify etiological agents of PLA and to provide information of their 16S rRNA sequences for application to DNA-based techniques in the hospital. Twenty patients with PLA who underwent percutaneous catheter drainage, abscess culture, and blood culture for isolates were included. Genomic DNAs from abscess fluids were subjected to polymerase chain reaction and pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene with a 454 GS Junior System. The abscess and blood cultures were positive in nine (45%) and four (20%) patients, respectively. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene showed that 90% of the PLA fluid samples contained single or multiple genera of known bacteria such as Klebsiella, Fusobacterium, Streptococcus, Bacteroides, Prevotella, Peptostreptococcus, unassigned Enterobacteriaceae, and Dialister. Klebsiella was predominantly found in the PLA fluid samples. All samples that carried unassigned bacteria had 26.8% reads on average. We demonstrated that the occurrence of PLA was associated with eight known bacterial genera as well as unassigned bacteria and that 16S rRNA gene sequencing was more useful than conventional culture methods for accurate identification of bacterial pathogens from PLA.
TI  - Management of odontogenic space infection with microbiology study.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dental infection has plagued humankind for as long as our civilization has been a fight against microorganisms by man dates back to ancient civilization. The discoveries of antibiotics are encouraging trends towards conquest of the microbial infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study emphasizes the detection of pathogenic microorganisms by microbiological examination and culture of specimens representative of the infection, importance of early and correct diagnosis of infections, prompt treatment and supportive care. RESULTS: The age group most commonly involved was in the third and fourth decades of life. Extraction followed by incision and drainage was done. The most commonly involved space was submandibular followed by buccal space. Thirty isolates were obtained. 43 % of the strains were strict anaerobes and 39 % were aerobes, with mixed growth was seen in 18.52 %. Amongst aerobes alpha hemolytic Streptococcus aureus and Peptostreptococcus as anaerobes were the most predominant followed by Bacteroides and Prevotella. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates were obtained from 18.52 % of total cases. Overall resistance to Penicillin was 22 %, amongst aerobes. CONCLUSION: Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid combination performed better, as 100 % strains were sensitive to it. The results of this study saw a changing trend in terms of predominance of anaerobic bacteria over aerobic ones.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of intravenous azithromycin followed by oral azithromycin for the treatment of acute pelvic inflammatory disease and perihepatitis in Japanese women.
AB  - Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is mainly caused by ascending infection from the vaginal flora including the sexually transmitted organisms, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis, and lower genital tract endogenous anaerobes, leading to serious consequences including infertility and ectopic pregnancy. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of azithromycin in the treatment of PID that requires initial intravenous therapy, we conducted a multicenter, unblinded, non-comparative phase 3 trial. Intravenous azithromycin (500 mg, once daily) for 1 or 2 days followed by oral azithromycin (250 mg once daily) to complete a total of 7 days treatment was administered to 60 Japanese women with acute PID. The clinical and bacteriological responses were assessed at the end of treatment, and on Days 15 and 29. The most commonly detected baseline causative pathogens were C. trachomatis (12 strains), Prevotella bivia (10 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (7 strains), N. gonorrhoeae and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (6 strains each). The clinical success rate on Day 15 was 94.1% (48/51 subjects including perihepatitis). The clinical efficacy and bacterial eradication rates against C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae (including 2 quinolone-resistant strains) were both 100%. Common treatment-related adverse events were diarrhoea, injection site pain, and nausea. All adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Azithromycin intravenous-to-oral switch therapy demonstrated excellent clinical and bacteriological effects for PID caused by various etiologic agents including quinolone-resistant strains and strains with low susceptibility to azithromycin at in vitro testing. The therapy was well tolerated in the treatment of PID in Japanese women. REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00871494.
TI  - A safe and practical decontamination method to reduce the risk of bacterial colonization of ultrasound transducers.
AB  - PURPOSE: Hospital-acquired infections is a major concern affecting patient management, in which medical instruments and devices play an important role. The purpose of this study was to determine the degree of bacterial contamination of the sonographic probe and describe an effective, safe, and practical decontamination method. METHODS: The study's sample consisted of 50 patients. Cultures were taken from the probe surface both after each examination and after the probes had been wiped clean with a dry, nonsterile paper towel. Cultures were also taken randomly from the coupling gel. RESULTS: Initial cultures were positive in 49 cases (98%) for aerobic and in 26 cases (52%) for anaerobic bacteria. Cultures obtained after cleaning the probe were positive in only 21 cases (42%) for aerobic and in 12 cases (24%) for anaerobic bacteria. The most common bacteria isolated in the aerobic cultures were Streptococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, and in the anaerobic cultures were Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. All cultures taken from the coupling gel were negative. CONCLUSIONS: Sonographic probes may act as a medium for bacterial contamination and transmission. Cleaning of the probe with a dry, nonsterile paper towel is an easy, effective, low-cost, and device-friendly method that can reduce this risk.
TI  - An antibacterial metabolite from Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae F2.
AB  - In searching for symbionts derived from bioactive natural products, six sulfureous diketopiperazines designated as lasiodiplines A-F (1-6) were characterized from the culture of Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae F2, previously residing in the apparently normal flower of Illigera rhodantha (Hernandiaceae). Identification of structures was accomplished by a combination of spectroscopic and computational approaches, in conjunction with the low-temperature (100K) single-crystal X-ray diffraction with Cu Kalpha radiation. Lasiodipline E (5) was demonstrated to be antibacterial against the clinical strains Streptococcus sp., Bacteroides vulgates, Peptostreptococcus sp. and Veillonella parvula, respectively, with an minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) range of 0.12-0.25 mug/mL. In addition, compounds 4 and 6 exemplify two unusual architectures of natural cyclodipeptides, signifying the unique biochemical characteristics of the producing fungus.
TI  - Tricomponent complex loaded with a mosquito-stage antigen of the malaria parasite induces potent transmission-blocking immunity.
AB  - The development of malaria vaccines is challenging, partly because the immunogenicity of recombinant malaria parasite antigens is low. We previously demonstrated that parasite antigens integrated into a tricomponent immunopotentiating complex increase antiparasitic immunity. In this study, the B domains of a group G Streptococcus (SpG) strain and Peptostreptococcus magnus (PpL) were used to evaluate whether vaccine efficacy is influenced by the type of immunoglobulin-binding domain (IBD) in the tricomponent complex. IBDs were fused to a pentameric cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) to increase the binding avidity of the complexes for their targets. The COMP-IBD fusion proteins generated (COMP-SpG and COMP-PpL and the previously constructed COMP-Z) bound a large fraction of splenic B lymphocytes but not T lymphocytes. These carrier molecules were then loaded with an ookinete surface protein of Plasmodium vivax, Pvs25, by chemical conjugation. The administration of the tricomponent complexes to mice induced more Pvs25-specific serum IgG than did the unloaded antigen. The PpL complex, which exhibited a broad Ig-binding spectrum, conferred higher vaccine efficacy than did the Z or SpG complexes when evaluated with a membrane feed assay. This study demonstrates that this tricomponent immunopotentiating system, incorporating IBDs as the B-lymphocyte-targeting ligands, is a promising technology for the delivery of malaria vaccines, particularly when combined with an aluminum salt adjuvant.
TI  - Bacteriological evaluation of tonsillar microbial flora according to age and tonsillar size in recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  - Although numerous studies based on the bacteriology of the tonsil have been carried out, none of them analyzed the variation of tonsillar flora with respect to both age and tonsillar size. The purpose of this study was to isolate the facultative and obligate anaerobes both from the surface and the core of tonsils in recurrent tonsillitis as well as to analyze the variation of isolated bacterial strains according to age and tonsillar size. A prospective study was performed on 111 patients who underwent tonsillectomy. We analyzed the differences between the bacterial pathogens in recurrent tonsillitis and semi-growth estimates with regard to age and tonsillar grade. Among 111 cases, 604 bacterial strains of 21 different from the tonsil superficial and core were isolated. The most common facultative anaerobic species isolated from the surface and core were Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Alpha-hemolytic streptococci and Diphtheroid bacilli in all subgroups except patients below 8 years old. The most commonly obligate anaerobic species isolated from the core were Propionibacterium acnes, Prevotella melaninogenica and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. We found no significant difference in the cultured bacteria with respect to age and tonsillar size. The study subgroups did not differ in the occurrence of semiquantitative growth estimates of 3-4+. Our study demonstrates that there is polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic flora in tonsils with regardless of patient's age and tonsillar size. This polymicrobial spectrum of bacteria may contribute to recurrence and to the failure of conservative treatment of these cases and therefore leads to surgical therapy.
TI  - Complications of adenotonsillectomy: a case report of meningitis due to dual infection with nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and a prospective study of the rate of postoperative bacteremia.
AB  - CASE REPORT: Bacterial meningitis is a rare complication of adenotonsillectomy. We present a case of meningitis due to nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae after adenotonsillectomy. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns indicated that the oral cavity was the source of H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid. BLOOD CULTURE STUDY: As bacteremia is thought to be one of the etiologies of meningitis, we prospectively investigated the rate of bacteremia as a complication of adenotonsillectomy. Of the 46 patients included in the study, mean age of five years old, 11 (24%) had positive blood cultures during the operation. H. influenzae was the commonest organism grown (seven cultures), three of seven produced beta-lactamase, followed by S. pneumoniae (one culture), H. parainfluenzae (one culture), Peptostreptococcus micros (one culture), and Veillonella spp. (one culture). The bacteria were composed of tonsil or adenoid surface cultures in eight of 11 patients (73%). CONCLUSIONS: We present a rare case of meningitis complicating a adenotonsillectomy procedure, in a three years old boy. Meningitis is a rare complication of adenotonsillectomy, but bacteremia which may lead to meningitis occurs frequently, as the results.
TI  - Descending necrotizing mediastinitis: a modified algorithmic approach to define a new standard of care.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Descending necrotizing mediastinitis (DNM) is a highly morbid infectious process. This uncommon disease process has carried historically a substantial burden of morbidity and mortality. In this study we hypothesized that application of a prospective modified management algorithm would decrease the morbidity and mortality from this highly destructive process. METHODS: We developed a systematic approach for managing DNM, focusing on serial debridement guided by imaging, in conjunction with the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and modern principles of critical care. We reviewed all patients admitted with this disease process from 2007-2012. Data collected included demographic information, co-morbidities, laboratory data including culture results, operative details, imaging frequency and findings, complications, and survival. Continuous variables were reported as median values and ranges. RESULTS: From 2007-2010, we treated eight patients with DNM. The median age of the patients was 33 y (range 28-63 y), and 63% were male. In accordance with our algorithm, the patients underwent serial imaging at regular intervals following operative debridement. The median number of imaging studies was 11 (range 4-19). The patients required a median of five operative debridements (range 1-15). In five patients, drainage was necessary through a cervical exploration. A thoracic approach was required in six patients (two thoracoscopic, four via thoracotomy). Additional procedures included thymectomy (n=2), anterior mediastinotomy, carotid sheath exploration and resections of the clavicle, first rib, manubrium, pectoralis major muscle, and sternocleidomastoid muscle. The most common etiologic agents were Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus anginosus. Study patients received a median of six different antibiotics (range 2-10) for a total of 42 d (range 34-55 d). These patients were hospitalized for a median of 29 days (range 16-56 d), with 15 d (range 7-48 d) spent in the intensive care unit. Remarkably, the rate of survival was 100% (median follow-up of 33 mo). The patients developed no major complications, required no re-admissions, and had no re-infections. CONCLUSIONS: We applied an algorithmic approach to the treatment of DNM, consisting of aggressive operative debridement and enhanced by equally aggressive imaging. Our patients had excellent outcomes despite the widely known lethality of DNM. An aggressive approach may decrease complications and improve survival in this devastating disease process. Furthermore, our prospective experience with DNM suggests that this algorithm used in the present study should be the standard for managing patients with this challenging condition.
TI  - Diagnosis of gas gangrene: does a discrepancy exist between the published data and practice.
AB  - The Infectious Disease Society of America has defined gas gangrene as an infection caused by Clostridium species. However, in many clinical settings, soft tissue infections that produce subcutaneous gas have been diagnosed as gas gangrene without identification of the presence of Clostridium species. Instead, the diagnosis was based on clinical and radiographic findings. A chart review was performed of 25 consecutive patients treated at the Atlantic Health System for infections of the lower extremity that were diagnosed as gas gangrene. Wound cultures from the 25 patients grew 31 different species of bacteria. The most prevalent organism was Staphylococcus aureus, which accounted for 17 of 31 (54.84%) different organisms identified and 19.77% of 86 separate aerobic or anaerobic cultures. The most prevalent genus was Streptococcus, which accounted for 20 (64.52%) of the organisms identified and 23.26% of the cultures. The most prevalent anaerobic genus was Peptostreptococcus, which accounted for 8 (25.81%) of the organisms identified and 9.3% of the cultures. None of the cultures grew Clostridium species. These findings showed that gas-forming soft tissue infections of the lower extremity, commonly diagnosed as gas gangrene, are rarely caused by Clostridium species.
TI  - Microarray analysis of microbiota of gingival lesions in noma patients.
AB  - Noma (cancrum oris) is a gangrenous disease of unknown etiology affecting the maxillo-facial region of young children in extremely limited resource countries. In an attempt to better understand the microbiological events occurring during this disease, we used phylogenetic and low-density microarrays targeting the 16S rRNA gene to characterize the gingival flora of acute noma and acute necrotizing gingivitis (ANG) lesions, and compared them to healthy control subjects of the same geographical and social background. Our observations raise doubts about Fusobacterium necrophorum, a previously suspected causative agent of noma, as this species was not associated with noma lesions. Various oral pathogens were more abundant in noma lesions, notably Atopobium spp., Prevotella intermedia, Peptostreptococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus anginosus. On the other hand, pathogens associated with periodontal diseases such as Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga spp., Porphyromonas spp. and Fusobacteriales were more abundant in healthy controls. Importantly, the overall loss of bacterial diversity observed in noma samples as well as its homology to that of ANG microbiota supports the hypothesis that ANG might be the immediate step preceding noma.
TI  - The predominant bacteria isolated from radicular cysts.
AB  - PURPOSE: To detect predominant bacteria associated with radicular cysts and discuss in light of the literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical materials were obtained from 35 radicular cysts by aspiration. Cultures were made from clinical materials by modern laboratory techniques, they underwent microbiologic analysis. RESULTS: The following are microorganisms isolated from cultures: Streptococcus milleri Group (SMG) (23.8%) [Streptococcus constellatus (19.1%) and Streptococcus anginosus (4.7%)], Streptococcus sanguis (14.3%), Streptococcus mitis (4.7%), Streptococcus cremoris (4.7%), Peptostreptococcus pevotii (4.7%), Prevotella buccae (4.7%), Prevotella intermedia (4.7%), Actinomyces meyeri (4.7%), Actinomyces viscosus (4.7%), Propionibacterium propionicum (4.7%), Bacteroides capillosus (4.7%), Staphylococcus hominis (4.7%), Rothia denticariosa (4.7%), Gemella haemolysans (4.7%), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (4.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study demonstrated that radicular cysts show a great variety of anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial flora. It was observed that all isolated microorganisms were the types commonly found in oral flora. Although no specific microorganism was found, Streptococcus spp. bacteria (47.5%) - especially SMG (23.8%) - were predominantly found in the microorganisms isolated. Furthermore, radicular cysts might be polymicrobial originated. Although radicular cyst is an inflammatory cyst, some radicular cyst fluids might be sterile.
TI  - Alteration of digestive tract microbiome in neonatal Holstein bull calves by bacitracin methylene disalicylate treatment and scours.
AB  - The effects of bacitracin methylene disalicylate (BMD) and scours on the fecal microbiome, animal performance, and health were studied in Holstein bull calves. Holstein bull calves (n = 150) were obtained from a single source at 12 to 24 h of age. Bull calves were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatments including CON (no BMD; n = 75 calves) and BMD (n = 75 calves). Starting 3 d after arrival, BMD was added into milk replacer (0.5 g/feeding; twice daily) and fed to the calves for 10 consecutive d. No differences (P > 0.10) were observed in ADG for d 0 to 28 and d 0 to 56, DMI for d 0 to 28, d 29 to 56, and d 0 to 56, or G:F for d 0 to 28, d 29 to 56, and d 0 to 56; ADG for d 29 to 56 tended to increase (P < 0.10) for BMD-treated calves compared with controls. Fecal samples were collected from 15 scouring calves and 10 cohorts (nonscouring calves received on the same day and administered the same treatment as the scouring calves). Animal morbidity and fecal score did not vary between the 2 treatments. Mortality was not influenced by the treatments in the BMD administration period or throughout the experiment. Fecal samples were subjected to pyrotagged 454 FLX pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicon to examine compositional dynamics of fecal microbes. Escherichia, Enterococcus, and Shigella had greater (P < 0.05) populations in the BMD group whereas Dorea, Roseburia, Fecalibacterium, Papillibacter, Collinsella, Eubacterium, Peptostreptococcus, and Prevotella were decreased (P < 0.05) by BMD treatment. Genus populations were also compared between scouring and nonscouring calves. Streptococcus was the only genus that had notable increase (P < 0.05) in fecal samples from scouring calves whereas populations of Bacteroides, Roseburia, and Eubacterium were markedly (P < 0.05) greater in nonscouring calves. These results show that BMD has the ability to alter the composition of the fecal microbiome but failed to improve performance in Holstein bull calves. Discrepancy of microorganism profiles between scouring and nonscouring calves might be associated with the occurrence of scours and bacterial genera identified might be potential target of treating diarrhea.
TI  - A consortium of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Streptococcus parasanguinis, and Filifactor alocis is present in sites prior to bone loss in a longitudinal study of localized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-induced localized aggressive periodontitis  (LAP) in African-American adolescents has been documented but is poorly understood. Two thousand fifty-eight adolescents aged 11 to 17 years were screened for their periodontal status and the presence of A. actinomycetemcomitans in their oral cavity. Seventy-one A. actinomycetemcomitans-negative and 63 A. actinomycetemcomitans-positive periodontally healthy subjects were enrolled, sampled, examined, and radiographed yearly for 3 years. Gingival and periodontal pocket depth and attachment levels were recorded. Disease presentation was characterized by bone loss (BL). Subgingival sites were sampled every 6 months to assess (i) the role of A. actinomycetemcomitans in BL and (ii) the association of A. actinomycetemcomitans and other microbes in their relationships to BL. Sixteen of 63 subjects with A. actinomycetemcomitans developed BL (the other 47 subjects with A. actinomycetemcomitans had no BL). No A. actinomycetemcomitans-negative subjects developed BL. Human oral microbe identification microarray (HOMIM) was used for subgingival microbial assessment. On a subject level, pooled data from A. actinomycetemcomitans-positive subjects who remained healthy had higher prevalences of Streptococcus and Actinomyces species, while A. actinomycetemcomitans-positive subjects with BL had higher prevalences of Parvimonas micra, Filifactor alocis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and Peptostreptococcus sp. human oral taxon 113 (HOT-113). At vulnerable sites, A. actinomycetemcomitans, Streptococcus parasanguinis, and F. alocis levels were elevated prior to BL. In cases where the three-organism consortium (versus A. actinomycetemcomitans alone) was detected, the specificity for detecting sites of future BL increased from 62% to 99%, with a sensitivity of 89%. We conclude that detecting the presence of A. actinomycetemcomitans, S. parasanguinis, and F. alocis together indicates sites of future BL in LAP. A synergistic interaction of this consortium in LAP causation is possible and is the subject of ongoing research.
TI  - Regioselective covalent immobilization of recombinant antibody-binding proteins A, G, and L for construction of antibody arrays.
AB  - Immobilized antibodies are useful for the detection of antigens in highly sensitive microarray diagnostic applications. Arrays with the antibodies attached regioselectively in a uniform orientation are typically more sensitive than those with random orientations. Direct regioselective immobilization of antibodies on a solid support typically requires a modified form of the protein. We now report a general approach for the regioselective attachment of antibodies to a surface using truncated forms of antibody-binding proteins A, G, and L that retain the structural motifs required for antibody binding. The recombinant proteins have a C-terminal CVIX protein farnesyltransferase recognition motif that allows us to append a bioorthogonal azide or alkyne moiety and use the Cu(I)-catalyzed Huisgen cycloaddition to attach the binding proteins to a suitably modified glass surface. This approach offers several advantages. The recombinant antibody-binding proteins are produced in Escherichia coli, chemoselectively modified posttranslationally in the cell-free homogenate, and directly attached to the glass surface without the need for purification at any stage of the process. Complexes between immobilized recombinant proteins A, G, and L and their respective strongly bound antibodies were stable to repeated washing with PBST buffer at pH 7.2. However, the antibodies could be stripped from the slides by treatment with 0.1 M glycine.HCl buffer, pH 2.6, for 30 min and regenerated by shaking with PBS buffer, pH 7.2, at 4 degrees C overnight. The recombinant forms of proteins A, G, and L can be used separately or in combination to give glass surfaces capable of binding a wide variety of antibodies.
TI  - [Illumina sequencing 16S rRNA tagging reveals diverse vaginal microbiomes associated with bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze and compare vaginal microbiomes in healthy women at child-bearing ages and patients with bacterial vaginosis (BV). METHODS: A total of 74 vaginal swabs of the vaginal fornix were collected from 37 BV patients and 37 healthy women. BV status was assessed according to Amsels clinical criteria for all the subjects and confirmed using Gram-stain criteria (Nugent scores). Genomic DNA of the samples was extracted for amplifying the 16S rRNA V6 hypervariable region by PCR and pyrosequencing by Illumina. BIPES, UCHIME, TSC and GAST were employed to analyze the information of the species from the samples. RESULTS: Lactobacillus was the predominant species in healthy women (more than 95%), including mainly L. iners and L. crispatus, with a small quantity of Gardnerella, Granulicatella, Streptococcus, Prevotella, Escherichia and other genus. The alpha diversity was significantly increased in 30 BV patients (P<0.001), and beta diversity also changed obviously shown by decreased Lactobacillus (varying from 45% to 1%, consisting mainly of L. iners) or even absence Lactobacillus in 6 cases, with increased relative abundance of Gardnerella, Prevotella, Granulicatella, Anaerococcus, Parvimonas, Peptoniphilus.harei, Peptostreptococcus, and Dialister. Different from previous data, 7 BV cases showed a predominance of the rare species L.gasseri and L.acidophilus (75% to 50%). CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus is the predominant vaginal species in healthy women (mainly L. iners and L. crispatus) co-existing with many other bacteria and a variety of microorganisms. Lactobacillus is significantly decreased and even absent in most of BV patients, and some cases show the predominance of the rare species L.gasseri and L.acidophilus.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Brazilian propolis extracts against rumen bacteria in vitro.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of three Brazilian propolis extracts was evaluated on  bacterial strains representing major rumen functional groups. The extracts were prepared using different concentrations of propolis and alcohol, resulting in different phenolic compositions. The propolis extracts inhibited the growth of Fibrobacter succinogenes S85, Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1, Ruminococcus albus 7, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens D1, Prevotella albensis M384, Peptostreptococcus sp. D1, Clostridium aminophilum F and Streptococcus bovis Pearl11, while R. albus 20, Prevotella bryantii B(1)4 and Ruminobacter amylophilus H18 were resistant to all the extracts. The inhibited strains showed also different sensitivity to propolis; the hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria (C. aminophilum F and Peptostreptococcus sp. D1) being the most sensitive. Inhibition of hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria by propolis would be beneficial to the animal. The extract containing the lowest amount of phenolic compounds (LLOS C3) showed the lowest antimicrobial activity against all the bacteria. The major phenolic compounds identified in the propolis extracts (naringenin, chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and Artepillin C) were also evaluated on four sensitive strains. Only naringenin showed inhibitory effect against all strains, suggesting that naringenin is one of the components participating to the antibacterial activity of propolis.
TI  - The microbiology of the peri-implant sulcus following successful implantation of  oral prosthetic treatments.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral implants are widely used in partially and fully edentulous patients; however, the integration of an implant can be endangered by factors such as intraoral bacteria or inflammatory reactions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the microbial flora present in the sulcus around dental implants and to assess the relationship between gingival health and microbial flora present. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients who had received oral implants with no complications were followed for a period of 9 months. Assessment of probing depth, the presence of bleeding on probing and microbial sampling from the peri-implant sulcus were performed at three different time points- 4 weeks after surgery, 1 month and 6 months after loading. The samples were taken by paper points and transferred to the microbiology lab in thioglyocolate cultures. In order to do a colony count and isolate the aerobic capnophilic and anerobic bacteria the samples were cultured and incubated on laboratory media. The colonies were also identified using various diagnostic tests. Alterations in the presence of various bacterial species over time and gum health were tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's test post hoc. RESULTS: The average pocket depth for each patient ranged from 1.37 +/- 0.39 mm to 2.55 +/- 0.72 mm. The bacteria isolated from the cultured samples included aerobic, facultative anerobic, obligate anerobic and capnophilic bacteria. CONCLUSION: The anerobic conditions created in the peri-implant sulcus might with time enhance the number of anerobic bacteria present following dental implant loading.
TI  - Randomized controlled trial: lip piercing: the impact of material on microbiological findings.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether there are microbiological differences in bacterial samples collected from labial piercings made of different materials. METHODS: Sterile piercings of 4 materials were randomly allocated to 80 pierced subjects. After 2 weeks, microbiologic samples were collected and processed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization methods. Wilcoxon signed ranks and Mann-Whitney tests were used for statistical analysis (adjustment for multiple comparisons). RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between material groups in relation to baseline data. In samples from stainless steel piercings, the total microbial load was significantly higher than the other materials (P<.05). Ten (mainly periopathogenic) species were found at significantly higher levels (P<.001) on steel than on polypropylene and/or polytetrafluoroethylene piercings. CONCLUSIONS: Labial piercings made of stainless steel could promote the development of a pathogenic biofilm.
TI  - Incorporating into a Calpha Go model the effects of geometrical restriction on Calpha atoms caused by side chain orientations.
AB  - Coarse-grained Go models have been widely used for studying protein-folding mechanisms. Despite the simplicity of the model, these can reproduce the essential features of the folding process of a protein. However, it is also known that side chains significantly contribute to the folding mechanism. Hence, it is desirable to incorporate the side chain effects into a coarse-grained Go model. In this study, to distinguish the effects of side chain orientation and to understand how these effects contribute to folding mechanisms, we incorporate into a Calpha Go model not only heterogeneous contact energies but also geometrical restraints around two Calpha atoms in contact with each other. We confirm that the heterogeneity of contact energies governs the folding pathway of a protein and that the geometric constraints attributed to side chains reproduce cooperative transitions in folding.
TI  - [V. A. C. INSTILL(R) therapy - new option in septic thoracic surgery].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The V. A. C. INSTILL(R) therapy is an innovative process for treating chronic wounds that are not optimally accessible to a systemic antibiotic therapy or infected with multi-resistant pathogens. We report on our first experience and applications of V. A. C. INSTILL(R) therapy in the field of septic thoracic surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: V. A. C. INSTILL therapy was used in 11 cases between 11/2009 and 01/2012. Three patients had sternum osteomyelitis (2 MRSA, 1 Finegoldia magna). In 3 patients chronic pleural empyema after lobectomy (1 Streptococcus viridans, 1 mixed infection with MRSA among others) and after pneumectomy (1 MRSA) were detected. In 2 cases there was an acute pleural empyema with extensive phlegmona in the region of the thoracic soft tissues (2 streptococci). In 1 patient a chronic pleural empyema with MRSA infection was treated. Septic arthritis of the sternoclavicular joint with joint destruction and extensive phlegmona in the region of the cervical soft tissues (1 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 Staphylococcus aureus) was treated in 2 patients. In all cases instillation of the wound was performed with Lavasept 0.2 %. Swabs of the wound were taken before starting and after ending V. A. C. INSTILL(R) therapy as well as before wound closure. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 48.8 +/- 18.9 years. V. A. C. INSTILL(R) therapy was performed for 6.5 +/- 1.7 days. Instillation time amounted to 21.7 +/- 5.7 s. The duration of action was standardised at 18 min in all cases. In 2 cases (1 MESA, 1 finegoldia) the V. A. C. INSTILL(R) therapy was repeated. In 10 patients a sterile wound status was achieved before secondary wound closure. All wounds underwent secondary closure without recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic osteomyelitis with MRSA infections as well as chronically infected residual cavities after empyema surgery and extensive phlegmona are possible indications for V. A. C. INSTILL(R) therapy in order to help eradicating the infection as quickly and as completely as possible.
TI  - Bacterial adhesion on the titanium and zirconia abutment surfaces.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Microorganisms harboring the oral cavity, mainly those related to periodontal diseases, are the most potential etiologic factor of failure in long-term implant treatment. The material used for abutment components may influence the adhesion and colonization of microbial species. The aim of this in vivo investigation was to evaluate the biofilm formation on machined (MPT) or cast titanium (CPT) and zirconia abutments (Zc). METHODS: Six healthy subjects were enrolled in this randomized crossover clinical investigation. The study was conducted in three phases according to abutment surface evaluated. Each subject used an individual oral splint containing four disks of the same tested substrate, two located in the anterior and two in the posterior region, totalizing 12 specimens for subject. Participants were asked to use the removable intraoral splint during 24 h. DNA checkerboard hybridization method was used to identify and quantify 38 bacterial species colonizing formed biofilm on the abutment substrates. RESULTS: Pathogens and non-pathogens species were found colonizing the three substrates surfaces. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Neisseria mucosa, Porphyromonas aeruginosa, Peptostreptococcus anaerobios, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus parasanguinis, and Tanerella forsythia were the only species with no significant differences over the tested materials (P > 0.05). All the other target species presented significant differences sought by Friedman test (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant difference in the total bacterial count between the three groups. CPT presented the higher mean counts, followed by MPT and Zc. CPT group also showed a higher mean incidence of species than MPT and Zc. The anterior or posterior region of disks placement did not show significant differences in relation to bacterial adhesion.
TI  - Comprehensive microbiological findings in peri-implantitis and periodontitis.
AB  - AIM: The microbial differences between peri-implantitis and periodontitis in the  same subjects were examined using 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the deepest pockets of peri-implantitis and periodontitis sites in six subjects. The prevalence of bacteria was analysed using a 16S rRNA gene clone library and real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: A total of 333 different taxa were identified from 799 sequenced clones; 231 (69%) were uncultivated phylotypes, of which 75 were novel. The numbers of bacterial taxa identified at the sites of peri-implantitis and periodontitis were 192 and 148 respectively. The microbial composition of peri-implantitis was more diverse when compared with that of periodontitis. Fusobacterium spp. and Streptococcus spp. were predominant in both peri-implantitis and periodontitis, while bacteria such as Parvimonas micra were only detected in peri-implantitis. The prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria was not high, while quantitative evaluation revealed that, in most cases, prevalence was higher at peri-implantitis sites than at periodontitis sites. CONCLUSIONS: The biofilm in peri-implantitis showed a more complex microbial composition when compared with periodontitis. Common periodontopathic bacteria showed low prevalence, and several bacteria were identified as candidate pathogens in peri-implantitis.
TI  - Bacterial diversity in the saliva of patients with different oral hygiene indexes.
AB  - The objective of the present study was to evaluate the bacterial diversity in the saliva of patients with different oral hygiene indexes using of two 16S rRNA gene libraries. Each library was composed of samples from patients with different averages of the differentiated Silness-Loe biofilm index: the first library (A) with an index between 1.0 and 3.0 (considered a high index) and the second library (B) between 0 and 0.5 (considered a low index). Saliva DNA was extracted and the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and cloned. The obtained sequences were compared with those stored at NCBI and RDP GenBank. The saliva of patients with high index presented five known genera - Streptococcus, Granulicatella, Gemella, Veillonella and Peptostreptococcus - and 33.3% of nonculturable bacteria grouped into 23 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The saliva of patients with low index differed significantly from the first library (p=0.000) and was composed of 42 OTUs distributed into 11 known genera - Streptococcus, Granulicatella, Gemella, Veillonella, Oribacterium, Haemophilus, Escherichia, Neisseria, Prevotella, Capnocytophaga, Actinomyces - including 24.87% of nonculturable bacteria. It was possible to conclude that there is greater bacterial diversity in the saliva of patients with low dental plaque in relation to patients with high dental plaque.
TI  - Subgingival microflora in inflammatory bowel disease patients with untreated periodontitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the subgingival microflora composition of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with untreated chronic periodontitis and compare them with systemically healthy controls also having untreated chronic periodontitis. METHOD: Thirty IBD patients [15 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 15 with ulcerative colitis (UC)] and 15 control individuals participated in the study. All patients had been diagnosed with untreated chronic periodontitis. From every patient, subgingival plaque was collected from four gingivitis and four periodontitis sites with paper points. Samples from the same category (gingivitis or periodontitis) in each patient were pooled together and stored at -70 degrees C until analysis using a checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique for 74 bacterial species. RESULTS: Multiple-comparison analysis showed that the groups differed in bacterial counts for Bacteroides ureolyticus, Campylobacter gracilis, Parvimonas micra, Prevotella melaninogenica, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, and Treponema denticola (P<0.001). CD patients had significantly higher levels of these bacteria than UC patients either in gingivitis or in periodontitis sites (P<0.05). CD patients harbored higher levels of P. melaninogenica, S. aureus, S. anginosus, and S. mutans compared with controls both at gingivitis and at periodontitis sites (P<0.05). UC patients harbored higher levels of S. aureus (P=0.01) and P. anaerobius (P=0.05) than controls only in gingivitis sites. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that even with similar clinical periodontal parameters, IBD patients harbor higher levels of bacteria that are related to opportunistic infections in inflamed subgingival sites that might be harmful for the crucial microbe-host interaction.

TI  - A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study on the clinical and microbial  effects of an essential oil mouth rinse used by patients in supportive periodontal care.
AB  - AIM: This 3-month double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study evaluated the  clinical and microbial effects of an essential oil mouth rinse used as an adjunct to mechanical plaque control by patients in supportive periodontal care. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty patients were randomly allocated to an essential oil group (Listerine((R)) Coolmint; Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ, USA) or placebo group to rinse twice per day as an adjunct to mechanical plaque control. At baseline and after 3 months, plaque index (PI), gingivitis index (GI), probing pocket depth, bleeding on probing (BoP) and clinical attachment level were registered. Subgingival plaque samples were collected for the detection and quantification of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, Micromonas micros, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium genus and Streptococcus mutans by means of real-time PCR (qPCR). Patient's compliance, satisfaction and side effects were registered. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients in the essential oil group (mean age: 57) and 21 in the placebo group (mean age: 55) with acceptable oral hygiene at intake (mean PI <1.5 on a scale of 5) adhered to the study protocol. Gingivitis index, PI and BoP significantly reduced over time (P </= 0.029); however, between group analyses revealed no significant differences. There was no significant change over time neither in detection frequency nor load for any of the microbiota. Daily rinsing with an essential oil rinse was found safe and perceived beneficial by the patients. CONCLUSION: Patients in supportive periodontal care who are fairly compliant with oral hygiene may not benefit from additional mouth rinsing using an essential oil solution.
TI  - Pyrosequencing analysis of the salivary microbiota of healthy Chinese children and adults.
AB  - Describing the biogeography of bacterial communities within the human body is critical for establishing healthy baselines from which to detect differences associated with diseases. Little is known, however, about the baseline of normal salivary microbiota from healthy Chinese children and adults. With parallel barcoded 454 pyrosequencing, the bacterial diversity and richness of saliva were thoroughly investigated from ten healthy Chinese children and adults. The overall taxonomic distribution of our metagenomic data demonstrated that the diversity of salivary microbiota from children was more complex than adults, while the composition and richness of salivary microbiota were similar in children and adults, especially for predominant bacteria. A large number of bacterial phylotypes were shared by healthy children and adults, indicating the existence of a core salivary microbiome. In children and adults, the vast majority of sequences in salivary microbiota belonged to Streptococcus, Prevotella, Neisseria, Haemophilus, Porphyromonas, Gemella, Rothia, Granulicatella, Fusobacterium, Actinomyces, Veillonella, and Aggregatibacter, which constituted the major components of normal salivary microbiota. With the exception of Actinomyces, the other seven non-predominant bacteria including Moraxella, Leptotrichia, Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium, and members of Neisseriaceae, Flavobacteriaceae, and SR1 showed significant differences between children and adults (p < 0.05). We first established the framework of normal salivary microbiota from healthy Chinese children and adults. Our data represent a critical step for determining the diversity of healthy microbiota in Chinese children and adults, and our data established a platform for additional large-scale studies focusing on the interactions between health and diseases in the future.
TI  - Comparison of oral microbiota in tumor and non-tumor tissues of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial infections have been linked to malignancies due to their ability to induce chronic inflammation. We investigated the association of oral bacteria in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC/tumor) tissues and compared with adjacent non-tumor mucosa sampled 5 cm distant from the same patient (n = 10). By using culture-independent 16S rRNA approaches, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and cloning and sequencing, we assessed the total bacterial diversity in these clinical samples. RESULTS: DGGE fingerprints showed variations in the band intensity profiles within non-tumor and tumor tissues of the same patient and among the two groups. The clonal analysis indicated that from a total of 1200 sequences characterized, 80 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected representing six phyla, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, Actinobacteria and uncultivated TM7 in non-tumor and tumor libraries. In combined library, 12 classes, 16 order, 26 families and 40 genera were observed. Bacterial species, Streptococcus sp. oral taxon 058, Peptostreptococcus stomatis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus gordonii, Gemella haemolysans, Gemella morbillorum, Johnsonella ignava and Streptococcus parasanguinis I were highly associated with tumor site where as Granulicatella adiacens was prevalent at non-tumor site. Streptococcus intermedius was present in 70% of both non-tumor and tumor sites. CONCLUSIONS: The underlying changes in the bacterial diversity in the oral mucosal tissues from non-tumor and tumor sites of OSCC subjects indicated a shift in bacterial colonization. These most prevalent or unique bacterial species/phylotypes present in tumor tissues may be associated with OSCC and needs to be further investigated with a larger sample size.
TI  - Anaerobic oral flora in the North American black bear (Ursus americanus) in eastern North Carolina.
AB  - Microbial flora can provide insight into the ecology and natural history of wildlife in addition to improving understanding of health risks. This study examines the anaerobic oral flora of hunter killed black bears (Ursus americanus) in eastern North Carolina. Oral swabs from the buccal and lingual supragingival tooth surfaces of the first and second mandibular and maxillary molars of 22 black bears were inoculated onto Brucella Blood Agar plates supplemented with hemin and vitamin K after transport from the field using reduced oxoid nutrient broth. Sixteen anaerobic bacterial species, representing nine genera were identified using the RapID ANA II Micromethod Kit system and a number of organisms grown that could not be identified with the system. The most frequently identified anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Streptococcus constellatus, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. The diversity in the anaerobic oral flora of black bear in eastern North Carolina suggests the importance of including these organisms in basic health risk assessment protocols and suggests a potential tool for assessment of bear/habitat interactions.
TI  - Separation of antigens and antibodies by immunoaffinity chromatography.
AB  - CONTEXT: Affinity chromatography is an efficient antibody, antigen and protein separation method based on the interaction between specific immobilized ligands and target antibody, antigen, and so on. Populations of available ligands can be used to separate antibodies or their Fab fragments. Similarly, antigens can be isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography (IAC) on immobilized antibodies of low affinity. OBJECTIVE: This review describes the advantages, the applications, as well as the drawbacks, of IAC in the separation and purification of antibodies and antigens. METHODS: The present review discussed all types of purification and isolation of antibodies and antigens by IAC, including purification of antibodies using immobilized and synthetic mimic proteins A, G and L; isolation of Fab fragments of antibodies; separation of antibodies against different antigen forms; isolation of antigens by immobilized antibodies and so on. These methods come from over 60 references compiled from all major databases. RESULTS: Purification of antigens with antibodies should choose low-affinity antibodies to avoid denaturation of most proteins. Concern for cost and safety, prompted research activities focused on novel synthetic ligands with improved properties such as lower cost, avoidance of the risk of contamination associated with natural ligands of human or animal origin to isolate antibodies and antigens. CONCLUSION: It is anticipated that the improvements of IAC will have impact not only on large-scale production of antibodies but also on the generation of new affinity-based methods for the increasing number of proteins and antibody derivatives available by protein engineering and the proteomics revolution.
TI  - Microbial profiles in saliva from children with and without caries in mixed dentition.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the bacterial profiles in saliva of the isolated children for studying caries etiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples were collected from isolated children from 6 to 8years old including 20 caries-free (dmfs=0) (healthy) and 30 caries-active individuals (dmfs>8) (patients). 16S rRNA genes were amplified by PCR from bacterial DNA of saliva sample and labeled via incorporation of Cy3-dCTP in second nested PCR. After hybridization of labeled amplicons on HOMIM, the microarray slides were scanned and original data acquired from professional software. RESULTS: Collectively, 94 bacterial species or clusters representing six bacterial phyla and 30 genera were detected. A higher bacterial diversity was observed in patients than in healthy samples. Statistical analyses revealed eight species or clusters were detected more frequently in diseased patients than in healthy samples, while six different species were detected more frequently in healthy as compared to diseased patients. CONCLUSION: The diversity of microbe within saliva derived from isolated population increased in caries-active status, and there are some bacteria in salivary flora can be as candidate biomarkers for caries prognosis in mixed dentition. The imbalances in the resident microflora may be the ultimate mechanism of dental caries.
TI  - Molecular profiling of oral microbiota in jawbone samples of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Infection has been hypothesized as a contributing factor to bisphosphonate (BP)-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ). The objective of this study was to determine the bacterial colonization of jawbone and identify the bacterial phylotypes associated with BRONJ. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Culture-independent 16S rRNA gene-based molecular techniques were used to determine and compare the total bacterial diversity in bone samples collected from 12 patients with cancer (six, BRONJ with history of BP; six, controls without BRONJ, no history of BP but have infection). RESULTS: Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profile and Dice coefficient displayed a statistically significant clustering of profiles, indicating different bacterial population in BRONJ subjects and control. The top three genera ranked among the BRONJ group were Streptococcus (29%), Eubacterium (9%), and Pseudoramibacter (8%), while in the control group were Parvimonas (17%), Streptococcus (15%), and Fusobacterium (15%). H&E sections of BRONJ bone revealed layers of bacteria along the surfaces and often are packed into the scalloped edges of the bone. CONCLUSION: This study using limited sample size indicated that the jawbone associated with BRONJ was heavily colonized by specific oral bacteria and there were apparent differences between the microbiota of BRONJ and controls.
TI  - Host-bacterial interactions during induction and resolution of experimental gingivitis in current smokers.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Changes in clinical profiles, microbial succession, and immune mediator fluctuations have all been separately examined during onset and resolution of experimental gingivitis in smokers. However, because both the bacterial challenge and the host response contribute to periodontal disease, the purpose of this investigation is to simultaneously examine clinical, bacterial, and immune changes that occur during the onset and resolution of disease in smokers. METHODS: Experimental gingivitis was induced in 15 smokers for 21 days, followed by treatment with a sonic toothbrush for 21 days. Marginal and subgingival plaque and gingival crevicular fluid samples were collected at baseline; after 7, 14, and 21 days of undisturbed plaque formation; and 21 days after reinstitution of brushing. 16S cloning and sequencing was used for bacterial quantification, and multiplexed bead-based flow cytometry was used to quantify the levels of 27 immune mediators. RESULTS: Onset of clinical gingivitis was preceded by significant changes in the marginal and subgingival biofilms, with a decrease in the abundance of early colonizers, namely, Streptococcus, Veillonella, and Pseudomonas, and an increase in levels of periodontopathogens, such as Treponema, Selenomonas, Parvimonas, Dialister, and Campylobacter. This was accompanied by a decrease in anti-inflammatory, chemokine, and T-helper 2 (Th2) responses and altered Th1/Th2 ratios. Although the bacterial communities continued to shift in the same direction after onset of clinical gingivitis and returned to baseline levels after resolution of disease, the anti-inflammatory, chemokine, and Th2 profiles demonstrated an increase from day 14 that continued even after clinical health was evident. CONCLUSION: Both marginal and subgingival biofilms in smokers are characterized by early acquisition of pathogenic organisms, which elicit a sustained host response that persists even after removal of the bacterial challenge.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of MTAD and nisin in combination against common pathogens associated with root canal infection.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Many pathogenic microorganisms were found in an infected root canal. The object of this study was to evaluate the effect of MTAD in combination with nisin on the pathogens associated with root canal infection. METHODS: The survival rates of 9 pathogenic bacteria were determined after 1-, 5-, and 10-minute treatment with MTAD, MTAN (substitution of doxycycline with nisin), and MTADN (nisin in combination with doxycycline). The survival rates of Enterococcus faecalis in the starvation phase and pretreatment alkalization as well as in the normal physiological state under MTAD, MTAN, and MTADN challenge for 1, 5, and 10 minutes were evaluated and compared. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the morphologic modification of Actinomyces naeslundii, Lactobacillus paracasei, and Porphyromonas gingivalis after MTAD and MTADN treatment. RESULTS: L. fermenti, L. paracasei, A. viscosus, A. naeslundii, Streptococcus gordonii, and Peptostreptococcus were more sensitive to MTADN and MTAN than to MTAD. MTAD, MTAN, and MTADN showed a rapid antibacterial effect on P. gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Enterococcus faecalis in the stress state was as sensitive to MTAD, MTAN, and MTADN as the control E. faecalis. Furthermore, in the observation of scanning electron microscopy, the membranes in A. naeslundii and L. paracasei presented significant rupture, and P. gingivalis did not exhibit significant damage after MTADN treatment. CONCLUSIONS: MTAD in combination with nisin improved antibacterial efficacy against pathogens, especially for some gram-positive bacteria associated with persistent intracanal infection. Therefore, the combination had the potential to be used as an effective intracanal irrigation.
TI  - Extensive, non-healing scalp ulcer associated with trauma-induced chronic osteomyelitis.
AB  - A 77-year-old woman presented with a trauma to the scalp caused from the blade of a windmill. The condition was persistent from the past 50 years. At the initial examination, a deep, foul-smelling and well-circumscribed ulcer was apparent on the head region, involving the majority of the cranium. Skin biopsy specimens of the lesion were nonspecific. The bone biopsy showed extensive necrotic areas of bone and soft tissues, with lymphocytic exudate foci. A computed tomography scan of the head revealed bone destruction principally involving both the parietal bones, and parts of the frontal and occipital bones. Streptococcus parasanguis was isolated from the skin culture, and Proteus mirabilis and Peptostreptococcus sp. were identified in the cultures from the bone. A long-term treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (1 g/12 h) and levofloxacin (500 mg/day) was prescribed, but even after 6 months, the lesion remained unchanged. The frequency of occurrence of scalp ulcers in dermatological patients is less, principally because of the rich blood supply to this area. We have not found any similar case report of a scalp ulcer secondary to chronic osteomyelitis discovered more than 50 years after the causal trauma. We want to highlight the importance of complete cutaneous evaluation including skin and bone biopsies, when scalp osteomyelitis is suspected.
TI  - Microbiologic profile of endodontic infections from HIV- and HIV+ patients using  multiple-displacement amplification and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the microbiota of endodontic infections in necrotic pulp from HIV-negative and HIV-positive subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Root canal samples from necrotic pulp were collected from 40 HIV- and 20 HIV+ subjects. Pulps were amplified using multiple displacement amplification (MDA). Then, checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization was employed to assess the levels of 107 microbial taxa. The percentage of DNA probe count and the percentage of teeth colonized by each test species were investigated. Significant differences between groups regarding proportions of taxa and prevalence of the test species were sought using the Mann-Whitney test and the Chi-square analysis, respectively. RESULTS: The most prevalent taxa detected were Dialister pneumosintes, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Streptococcus sobrinus, Corynebacterium diphteriae, and Helicobacter pylori among HIV- subjects and D. pneumosintes, Prevotella tannerae, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Parvimonas micra, Prevotella nigrescens, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae among HIV+ individuals. D. pneumosintes, C. diphtheria, and C. albicans were the most abundant species in the HIV- group, whereas the predominant taxa in HIV+ samples were P. tannerae, D. pneumosintes and Olsenella uli. P. tannerae, O. uli, Veilonella dispar, Bacteroides fragilis, and Actinomyces meyeri were significantly more abundant in HIV+ samples. CONCLUSIONS: There were significant differences in the prevalence and proportions of specific microbial taxa between HIV- and HIV+ individuals. The root canal microbiota may represent a reservoir of important oral and medical pathogens, mainly in HIV+ individuals.
TI  - Protein L: a novel reagent for the detection of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) expression by flow cytometry.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been significant progress in the last two decades on the design of chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) for adoptive immunotherapy targeting tumor-associated antigens. Structurally CARs consist of a single chain antibody fragment directed against a tumor-associated antigen fused to an extracellular spacer and transmembrane domain followed by T cell cytoplasmic signaling moieties. Currently several clinical trials are underway using gene modified peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) with CARs directed against a variety of tumor associated antigens. Despite the improvements in the design of CARs and expansion of the number of target antigens, there is no universal flow cytometric method available to detect the expression of CARs on the surface of transduced lymphocytes. METHODS: Currently anti-fragment antigen binding (Fab) conjugates are most widely used to determine the expression of CARs on gene-modified lymphocytes by flow cytometry. The limitations of these reagents are that many of them are not commercially available, generally they are polyclonal antibodies and often the results are inconsistent. In an effort to develop a simple universal flow cytometric method to detect the expression of CARs, we employed protein L to determine the expression of CARs on transduced lymphocytes. Protein L is an immunoglobulin (Ig)-binding protein that binds to the variable light chains (kappa chain) of Ig without interfering with antigen binding site. Protein L binds to most classes of Ig and also binds to single-chain antibody fragments (scFv) and Fab fragments. RESULTS: We used CARs derived from both human and murine antibodies to validate this novel protein L based flow cytometric method and the results correlated well with other established methods. Activated human PBLs were transduced with retroviral vectors expressing two human antibody based CARs (anti-EGFRvIII, and anti-VEGFR2), two murine antibody derived CARs (anti-CSPG4, and anti-CD19), and two humanized mouse antibody based CARs (anti-ERBB2, and anti-PSCA). Transduced cells were stained first with biotin labeled protein L followed by phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated streptavidin (SA) and analyzed by flow cytometry. For comparison, cells were stained in parallel with biotin conjugated goat-anti-mouse Fab or CAR specific fusion proteins. Using protein L, all CAR transduced lymphocytes exhibited specific staining pattern ranging from 40 to 80% of positive cells (compared to untransduced cells) and staining was comparable to the pattern observed with anti-Fab antibodies. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate the feasibility of employing Protein L as a general reagent for the detection of CAR expression on transduced lymphocytes by flow cytometry.
TI  - Impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (RP) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [GR]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM) analysis. METHODS: Individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or >3 sites with AL >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GR (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >/=2.5 mm after treatment. Subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM analysis. Significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: The majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. Species that increased or persisted in high frequency in RP but were significantly reduced in GR included Bacteroidetes sp., Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Tannerella forsythia, Dialister spp., Selenomonas spp., Catonella morbi, Eubacterium spp., Filifactor alocis, Parvimonas micra, Peptostreptococcus sp. OT113, Fusobacterium sp. OT203, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Streptococcus intermedius or Streptococcus constellatus, and Shuttlesworthia satelles. In contrast, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Gemella haemolysans, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Kingella oralis, Lautropia mirabilis, Neisseria elongata, Rothia dentocariosa, Streptococcus australis, and Veillonella spp. were more associated with therapeutic success. CONCLUSION: Persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.
TI  - Defining the "core microbiome" of the microbial communities in the tonsils of healthy pigs.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Porcine tonsils are the colonization site for many pathogenic as well as commensal microorganisms and are the primary lymphoid tissue encountered by organisms entering through the mouth or nares. The goal of this study was to provide an in-depth characterization of the composition and structure of the tonsillar microbial communities and to define the core microbiome in the tonsils of healthy pigs, using high throughput bar-coded 454-FLX pyrosequencing. RESULTS: Whole tonsils were collected at necropsy from 12 16-week-old finisher pigs from two healthy herds. Tonsil brushes were also used to collect samples from four of these animals. Bacterial DNA was isolated from each sample, amplified by PCR with universal primers specific for the bacterial 16S rRNA genes, and the PCR products sequenced using pyrosequencing. An average of 13,000 sequences were generated from each sample. Microbial community members were identified by sequence comparison to known bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences.The microbiomes of these healthy herds showed very strong similarities in the major components as well as distinct differences in minor components. Pasteurellaceae dominated the tonsillar microbiome in all animals, comprising ~60% of the total, although the relative proportions of the genera Actinobacillus, Haemophilus, and Pasteurella varied between the herds. Also found in all animals were the genera Alkanindiges, Peptostreptococcus, Veillonella, Streptococcus and Fusobacterium, as well as Enterobacteriaceae and Neisseriaceae. Treponema and Chlamydia were unique to Herd 1, while Arcanobacterium was unique to Herd 2.Tonsil brushes yielded similar results to tissue specimens, although Enterobacteriaceae and obligate anaerobes were more frequently found in tissue than in brush samples, and Chlamydia, an obligately intracellular organism, was not found in brush specimens. CONCLUSIONS: We have extended and supported our previous studies with 16S clone libraries, using 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing to describe the microbial communities in tonsils of healthy pigs. We have defined a core microbiome, dominated by Pasteurellaceae, in tonsil specimens, and have also demonstrated the presence of unique minor components of the tonsillar microbiome present in each herd. We have validated the use of non-invasive tonsil brushes, in comparison to tonsil tissue, which will facilitate future studies.

TI  - Management outcome of NPC-related and non-NPC-related brain abscess in Hong Kong.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: (1) To review the patient profile, management outcome and prognostic  factors of brain abscess; (2) To compare the neurological outcome of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)-related brain abscess with non-NPC related brain abscess. METHOD: Retrospective review of consecutive patients diagnosed (radiologically and/or microbiologically) with brain abscess in a regional neurosurgical center in Hong Kong over a nine year period. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients were recruited into this study. There were 37 male and 17 female patients. Eighteen (33%) patients had previous radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Only 31 (57%) patients had fever on presentation. White cell count and/or C-reactive protein, was raised in 41 (76%) patients on admission. Surgical drainage was carried out in 49 (91%) patients, either by aspiration through a craniotomy, by drainage with corticotomy, or excision of the abscess. Abscess culture was positive in 45 (83%) patients. Common organisms isolated included Streptococcus species (35%) and Peptostreptococcus species (18%). Anaerobes were isolated in 50% of the NPC-related abscesses. The mean follow-up time was 34 months. At the 6 months interval, 24 (44%) patients had good recovery. Favorable outcome was achieved in 30 (55%) patients. NPC-related brain abscess was associated with unfavorable neurological outcome (33%, p = 0.04). There was also a trend towards higher in-patient mortality in patients with NPC-related brain abscess (22%, p = 0.08). CONCLUSION: Brain abscess carried a substantial morbidity and mortality despite aggressive surgical and medical treatment. Patients with NPC-related brain abscess had a higher mortality and unfavorable neurological outcome.
TI  - Plasma half-life extension of small recombinant antibodies by fusion to immunoglobulin-binding domains.
AB  - Many therapeutic proteins possessing a small size are rapidly cleared from circulation. Half-life extension strategies have therefore become increasingly important to improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of protein therapeutics. Here, we performed a comparative analysis of the half-life extension properties of various bacterial immunoglobulin-binding domains (IgBDs) derived from Staphylococcus protein A (SpA), Streptococcus protein G (SpG), and Finegoldia (formerly Peptostreptococcus) protein L (PpL). These domains, composed of 50-60 amino acid residues, were fused to the C terminus of a single-chain Fv and a bispecific single-chain diabody, respectively. All fusion proteins were produced in mammalian cells and retained their antigen-binding properties. The half-lives of the antibody molecules were prolonged to varying extents for the different IgBDs. The strongest effects in mice were observed for domain C3 of SpG (SpG(C3)) followed by domains B and D of SpA, suggesting that SpG(C3) is particularly useful to extend the plasma half-life of small proteins.
TI  - The subgingival microbiota of Papillon-Lefevre syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is little information about the microbiologic profiles of periodontal lesions in Papillon-Lefevre syndrome (PLS) and the significance of bacteria in the pathogenesis of periodontitis in these patients. This comprehensive analysis of the subgingival microbiota in patients with PLS used 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) clonal analysis and the 16S rRNA-based Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). METHODS: Thirteen patients with PLS from seven unrelated families volunteered for this microbiologic study. Subgingival plaque was collected with sterile paper points from multiple sites with >/=5 mm probing depth, and whole genomic DNA was extracted. The 16S rRNA genes were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. The samples were then probed for approximately 300 predominant oral bacterial species using the HOMIM. RESULTS: The most commonly detected phylotypes in the clonal analysis were Gemella morbillorum, Gemella haemolysans, Granulicatella adiacens, Lachnospiraceae OT 100 (EI074), Parvimonas micra, Selenomonas noxia, and Veillonella parvula. As a group, streptococci were commonly detected in these individuals. In the HOMIM analysis, a total of 170 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected, with a range of 40 to 80 species per patient with PLS. Of these, 12 bacterial species were detected in medium to high levels in >/=50% of the individuals. The high-frequency strains were clustered into eight groups: Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter spp., Capnocytophaga granulosa, G. morbillorum, P. micra, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Streptococcus spp., and Tannerella forsythia. CONCLUSIONS: The subgingival microbiota in PLS is diverse. Periodontal pathogens commonly associated with chronic and aggressive periodontitis and opportunistic pathogens may be associated with the development of severe periodontitis in patients with PLS.
TI  - Dental abnormalities in eight captive giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) in China.
AB  - Dental data from eight adult giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) (four females  and four males) were collected at the Beijing Zoo from February 2009 to July 2010. Examination findings were recorded in dental charts. All the pandas had different degrees of tooth wear. Incisors, canines and second premolars had the most abnormalities. Five animals had caries; molars were the most affected. Chip fractures were found in seven teeth (incisor, canine and premolar) of five pandas; two had complicated fractures of their canines. Premolars and other teeth were missing in three pandas. Different degrees of dental plaque and calculus were found in all animals. Two pandas had mild gingivitis; the depth of periodontal pockets in all pandas was normal (0-2 mm). Five pandas had abnormal tooth mobility. Samples of dental plaque were collected for microbial culture. Two hundred and fifty-three bacterial strains belonging to 48 species of 23 genera were isolated. Streptococcus, Moraxella, Peptostreptococcus and Porphyromonas were the dominant genera. Further research with larger sample sizes of free-ranging and captive giant pandas will be required in order to demonstrate the absence of the premolar tooth, tooth fractures and the relatively low prevalence of periodontal disease in captive giant pandas.
TI  - Structural segregation of gut microbiota between colorectal cancer patients and healthy volunteers.
AB  - Despite a long-suspected role in the development of human colorectal cancer (CRC), the composition of gut microbiota in CRC patients has not been adequately described. In this study, fecal bacterial diversity in CRC patients (n=46) and healthy volunteers (n=56) were profiled by 454 pyrosequencing of the V3 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Both principal component analysis and UniFrac analysis showed structural segregation between the two populations. Forty-eight operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified by redundancy analysis as key variables significantly associated with the structural difference. One OTU closely related to Bacteroides fragilis was enriched in the gut microbiota of CRC patients, whereas three OTUs related to Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides uniformis were enriched in that of healthy volunteers. A total of 11 OTUs belonging to the genera Enterococcus, Escherichia/Shigella, Klebsiella, Streptococcus and Peptostreptococcus were significantly more abundant in the gut microbiota of CRC patients, and 5 OTUs belonging to the genus Roseburia and other butyrate-producing bacteria of the family Lachnospiraceae were less abundant. Real-time quantitative PCR further validated the significant reduction of butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut microbiota of CRC patients by measuring the copy numbers of butyryl-coenzyme A CoA transferase genes (Mann-Whitney test, P<0.01). Reduction of butyrate producers and increase of opportunistic pathogens may constitute a major structural imbalance of gut microbiota in CRC patients.
TI  - Enteral tube feeding alters the oral indigenous microbiota in elderly adults.
AB  - Enteral tube feeding is widely used to maintain nutrition for elderly adults with eating difficulties, but its long-term use alters the environment of the oral ecosystem. This study characterized the tongue microbiota of tube-fed elderly adults by analyzing the 16S rRNA gene. The terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiles of 44 tube-fed subjects were compared with those of 54 subjects fed orally (average age, 86.4 +/- 6.9 years). Bar-coded pyrosequencing data were also obtained for a subset of the subjects from each group (15 tube-fed subjects and 16 subjects fed orally). The T-RFLP profiles demonstrated that the microbiota of the tube-fed subjects was distinct from that of the subjects fed orally (permutational multivariate analysis of variance [perMANOVA], P < 0.001). The pyrosequencing data revealed that 22 bacterial genera, including Corynebacterium, Peptostreptococcus, and Fusobacterium, were significantly more predominant in tube-fed subjects, whereas the dominant genera in the subjects fed orally, such as Streptococcus and Veillonella, were present in much lower proportions. Opportunistic pathogens rarely detected in the normal oral microbiota, such as Corynebacterium striatum and Streptococcus agalactiae, were often found in high proportions in tube-fed subjects. The oral indigenous microbiota is disrupted by the use of enteral feeding, allowing health-threatening bacteria to thrive.
TI  - Recovery of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in sinus fungal ball.
AB  - This case study with chart review describes the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of specimens obtained from 47 patients with Aspergillus spp fungus ball. Bacteria were recovered from 32 of the 47 (68%) patients. Eighty-six isolates, 29 aerobic and facultatives and 57 anaerobic, were recovered. Aerobic and facultatives only were recovered in 6 instances (19% of culture-positive specimens), anaerobes only in 11 (34%), and mixed aerobes and anaerobes in 15 (47%). The predominant aerobes were Staphylococcus aureus (6 isolates), alpha-hemolytic streptococci (5 isolates), Enterobacteriacae (4 isolates), and microaerophilic streptococci (4 isolates). The predominant anaerobes were Gram-negative bacilli (26), Peptostreptococcus spp (14), and Fusobacterium spp. (10). Twenty-two beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were recovered from 15 patients. These included all 6 S aureus and 2 Bacteroides fragilis group isolates, 4 of 10 of Fusobacteria, and 7 of 19 Prevotella and Porphyromonas. This study demonstrates the recovery of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora in the sinuses of patients with fungus ball.
TI  - [Characteristics of microbiocenosis of gingival pocket in patients with chronic generalized periodontitis].
AB  - As a result of examination of 56 patients with chronic generalized periodontitis  (CGP) of a moderate severity and a severe form of the disease, microflora from gingival pocket in patients which severe form of CGP was established to have higher specific weight in index of dissemination of strains such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogencs, Enterococcus, Corynebacterium spp., anaerobic bacteria. Strains from patients with a severe form of CGP were characterized by a higher level of expression of the factors of pathogenicity and persistence. Associations of streptococci and staphylococci which the representatives of anaerobic flora such as Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Prevotella, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus were more often revealed in patients with a severe form of CGP. Fact of microbial translocation from the gingival pocket was established: from the blood of the patients with CGP of a severe form, strains-translocants were cultivated by 4 times more frequently than from the patients with CGP of a moderate severity.
TI  - Detection of nine microorganisms from the initial carious root lesions using a TaqMan-based real-time PCR.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to quantify nine selected cariogenic bacteria in plaque from sound root surfaces and initial carious root lesions using TaqMan PCR and to analyse a putative dependence on the kind of initial periodontal treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-four subjects with generalized chronic periodontitis were randomly allocated to one of the following initial periodontal therapies: full-mouth disinfection, full-mouth scaling and root planing or scaling and root planing within 7 days. Plaque samples were taken before and after periodontal treatment and analysed by TaqMan PCR. RESULTS: The quantity of the cariogenic bacteria Actinomyces spp., Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacilllus spp., Rothia dentocariosa, Parvimonas micra, Propionibacterium acnes and Neisseria mucosa were significantly higher, while the quantity of Veillonella parvula was significantly lower on initial carious lesions than on the sound surfaces both before and after periodontal therapy. No significant differences could be found in any of the tested bacteria except P. micra on initial carious lesions and sound surfaces for both examinations between the groups. CONCLUSION: All the nine species analysed were found to be present in initial carious root lesions as well as sound root surfaces but in different quantities, independent of the different periodontal therapies.
TI  - Effects of adding polyclonal antibody preparations on ruminal fermentation patterns and digestibility of cows fed different energy sources.
AB  - Nine ruminally cannulated cows fed different energy sources were used to evaluate an avian-derived polyclonal antibody preparation (PAP-MV) against the specific ruminal bacteria Streptococcus bovis, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Clostridium aminophilum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Clostridium sticklandii and monensin (MON) on ruminal fermentation patterns and in vivo digestibility. The experimental design was three 3 x 3 Latin squares distinguished by the main energy source in the diet [dry-ground corn grain (CG), high-moisture corn silage (HMCS), or citrus pulp (CiPu)]. Inside each Latin square, animals received one of the feed additives per period [none (CON), MON, or PAP-MV]. Dry matter intake and ruminal fermentation variables such as pH, total short-chain fatty acids (tSCFA), which included acetate, propionate, and butyrate, as well as lactic acid and NH(3)-N concentration were analyzed in this trial. Total tract DM apparent digestibility and its fractions were estimated using chromic oxide as an external marker. Each experimental period lasted 21 d. Ruminal fluid sampling was carried out on the last day of the period at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h after the morning meal. Ruminal pH was higher (P = 0.006) 4 h postfeeding in MON and PAP-MV groups when compared with CON. Acetate:propionate ratio was greater in PAP-MV compared with MON across sampling times. Polyclonal antibodies did not alter (P > 0.05) tSCFA, molar proportion of acetate and butyrate, or lactic acid and NH(3)-N concentration. Ruminal pH was higher (P = 0.01), 4 h postfeeding in CiPu diets compared with CG and HMCS. There was no interaction between feed additive and energy source (P > 0.05) for any of the digestibility coefficients analyzed. Starch digestibility was less (P = 0.008) in PAP-MV when compared with CON and MON. In relation to energy sources, NDF digestibility was greater (P = 0.007) in CG and CiPu vs. the HMCS diet. The digestibility of ADF was greater (P = 0.002) in CiPu diets followed by CG and HMCS. Feeding PAP-MV or monensin altered ruminal fermentation patterns and digestive function in cows; however, those changes were independent of the main energy source of the diet.
TI  - Microflora in maxillofacial infections--a changing scenario?
AB  - PURPOSE: Advances in isolation and culturing techniques have brought the role of  anaerobic bacteria-causing maxillofacial infections to the fore. Recent literature also favors the role of anaerobes in maxillofacial infections. A prospective clinical and microbiological study was designed to check the validity of such claims. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 88 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Pus was obtained by aspirating the involved spaces and culture and sensitivity tests were performed to determine the microbes involved and their sensitivity to various antibiotics. RESULTS: Upon isolating the various organisms causing infection, it was found that 68.2% were aerobes, 13.6% were mixed infections, and 9.1% were anaerobes. Streptococcus and Peptostreptococcus species were the most common among aerobes and anaerobes, respectively. On determining sensitivity to penicillin, 81.3% were sensitive and 18.8% were resistant. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Staphylococcus aureus were predominantly resistant to penicillin. CONCLUSION: Analysis of the results indicated no change in microflora-causing infections in the maxillofacial region and penicillin remains the drug of choice in treating these infections.
TI  - [Resistance to B-lactamines of bacteria responsible for endodontic root canal infections].
AB  - Samples were taken under strictly anaerobic conditions from the root canals of 22 patients having a tooth in which necrotic pulp was associated with an inflammatory peri-apical lesion an optical periodontitis. In the majority of cases (85%), these lesions were chronic and the pulp chamber was closed. One hundred and two strains were isolated, 71.7% of the bacteria being obligate anaerobes and 49.8% being Gram-negative bacilli. Their ability to produce beta-lactamases was tested and 8.8% gave a positive reaction in a cefinase test. These cefinase positive strains were nevertheless susceptible to 3rd-generation cephalosporins (cefoxitin) and to amoxicillin-clavulanate, with the exception of M. Morganii.
TI  - Sitafloxacin: in bacterial infections.
AB  - Sitafloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial with in vitro activity against a  broad range of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including anaerobic bacteria, as well as against atypical pathogens. It is approved in Japan for use in a number of bacterial infections caused by sitafloxacin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, other Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Proteus spp., Morganella morganii, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella pneumophila, Peptostreptococcus spp., Prevotella spp., Porphyromonas spp., Fusobacterium spp., Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. In terms of clinical efficacy, oral sitafloxacin was noninferior to oral levofloxacin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia or an infectious exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract disease, noninferior to oral tosufloxacin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, and noninferior to oral levofloxacin in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, according to the results of randomized, double-blind, multicentre, noninferiority trials. Noncomparative studies demonstrated the efficacy of oral sitafloxacin in otorhinolaryngological infections, urethritis in men, C. trachomatis-associated cervicitis in women and odontogenic infections. Gastrointestinal disorders and laboratory abnormalities were the most commonly occurring adverse reactions in patients receiving oral sitafloxacin. Adverse reactions reported in sitafloxacin recipients in the active comparator trials were of mild to moderate severity.
TI  - Gingival tissue transcriptomes in experimental gingivitis.
AB  - AIMS: We investigated the sequential gene expression in the gingiva during the induction and resolution of experimental gingivitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty periodontally and systemically healthy non-smoking volunteers participated in a 3-week experimental gingivitis protocol, followed by debridement and 2-week regular plaque control. We recorded clinical indices and harvested gingival tissue samples from four interproximal palatal sites in half of the participants at baseline, Day 7, Day 14 and Day 21 (the "induction phase"), and at Day 21, Day 25, Day 30 and Day 35 in the other half (the "resolution phase"). RNA was extracted, amplified, reversed transcribed, amplified, labelled and hybridized using Affymetrix Human Genome U133Plus2.0 microarrays. Paired t-tests compared gene expression changes between consecutive time points. Gene ontology analyses summarized the expression patterns into biologically relevant categories. RESULTS: The median gingival index was 0 at baseline, 2 at Day 21 and 1 at Day 35. Differential gene regulation peaked during the third week of induction and the first 4 days of resolution. Leucocyte transmigration, cell adhesion and antigen processing/presentation were the top differentially regulated pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptomic studies enhance our understanding of the pathobiology of the reversible inflammatory gingival lesion and provide a detailed account of the dynamic tissue responses during the induction and resolution of experimental gingivitis.
TI  - Bacteriological findings and antimicrobial resistance in odontogenic and non-odontogenic chronic maxillary sinusitis.
AB  - The main objectives of this study were to estimate the frequency of chronic maxillary sinusitis of dental origin, and to evaluate the microbiology of odontogenic and non-odontogenic chronic maxillary sinusitis. Aspirates from 59 patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis (47 non-odontogenic, 12 odontogenic), collected during a 3-year period, were microbiologically processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Moreover, antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated in the isolated bacteria. In this study, 20 % of chronic maxillary sinusitis cases were associated with a dental origin, and sinus lift procedures were the main aetiological factor. Our microbiological findings showed that all specimens from chronic maxillary sinusitis were polymicrobial. Sixty aerobes and 75 anaerobes were recovered from the 47 cases of non-odontogenic sinusitis (2.9 bacteria per specimen); 15 aerobes and 25 anaerobes were isolated from the 12 patients with odontogenic sinusitis (3.3 bacteria per specimen). The predominant aerobes were Staphylococcus aureus (27) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (16), while the more frequent anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus species (31) and Prevotella species (30). Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were absent in sinusitis associated with a dental origin. Overall, 22 % of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were oxacillin-resistant, and 75 % of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were penicillin-resistant and/or erythromycin-resistant; 21 % of anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were penicillin-resistant, and 44 % of anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were beta-lactamase-positive. Vancomycin and quinopristin-dalfopristin had the highest in vitro activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus species, respectively; amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefotaxime showed the highest in vitro activity against aerobic Gram-negative bacteria; and moxifloxacin, metronidazole and clindamycin were the most active against anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Microbiology of sinusitis.
AB  - Most sinus infections are viral, and only a small proportion develops a secondary bacterial infection. Rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, and parainfluenza viruses are the most common causes of sinusitis. The most common bacteria isolated from pediatric and adult patients with community-acquired acute purulent sinusitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria (Prevotella and Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium and Peptostreptococcus spp.) are the main isolates in chronic sinusitis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other aerobic and facultative gram-negative rods are commonly isolated from patients with nosocomial sinusitis, the immunocompromised host, those with HIV infection, and in cystic fibrosis. Fungi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most common isolates in neutropenic patients. The microbiology of sinusitis is influenced by the previous antimicrobial therapy, vaccinations, and the presence of normal flora capable of interfering with the growth of pathogens.
TI  - Salivary blood group antigens and microbial flora.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Secretor is an individual with ability to produce blood group reactive substances in the exocrine glands and to secrete these substances in the body fluids such as saliva. In saliva the blood reactive antigens are found primarily on mucins which exhibit microheterogenicity and different subtypes of these molecules. This study was done to find out if the salivary blood group antigens have any role in the adherence of certain selected microorganism in the oral cavity. METHODS: Unstimulated whole saliva and sub gingival plaque samples were collected from subjects with clinically healthy gingival, chronic gingivitis and chronic periodontitis with probing pocket depth >/=4mm and attachment loss >/=1mm. Secretor status was determined by using Haemagglutination Inhibition Assay. Unstimulated whole saliva and sub gingival plaque samples were collected to culture and isolate the selected microorganisms. The clinical scores, secretor status and the presence or absence of selected microorganisms were compared within the groups using Chi-square test and students unpaired t-test. RESULTS: The numbers of secretors were more in the healthy group (22.2%) and non secretors were more in the chronic periodontitis group (22.2%). The clinical scores were higher in the in non secretors compared to the secretors in all the three groups. P intermedia and P gingivalis were prevalent among non secretors in chronic gingivitis group. (P=0.075 and P=0.032) and chronic periodontitis group (P=0.068 and P=0.009).
TI  - An in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (CloSYS Oral Rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. METHODS: Oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. The numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity. RESULTS: As expected, Listerine and Crest Pro-Health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. Breath Rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. CloSYS and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, CloSYS oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that CloSYS Oral Rinse has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.
TI  - Evaluation of three swab transport systems for the maintenance of clinically important bacteria in simulated mono- and polymicrobial samples.
AB  - In this study, three swab transport systems were evaluated: M40 Transystem, Amies broth with a relatively new type of swab (both Copan Diagnostics, Corona, CA, USA), and SSI transportmedium (Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen Denmark). The CLSI M40-A standard procedures and 11 culture collection strains were used. The transport systems were tested at room temperature for holding times of 0, 24, and 48 h, and both mono- and polymicrobial samples were included. After 24 h of simulated transportation, all systems were able to maintain the viability of all organisms tested. SSI transportmedium exhibited the lowest maintaining ability, whereas the two Copan systems were the most growth-promoting system. In polymicrobial samples, this latter feature was a problem. At 48 h, no transport system could maintain the viability of all strains, and the recovery rates differed depending on organism and device. The species most difficult to recover in all the three systems was Neisseria gonorrhoeae. When selecting a swab transport system, consideration must be given to the sample type, the conditions that prevail locally, and the performance in the clinical setting.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of bactericidal potential of four root canal filling materials against microflora of infected non-vital primary teeth.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Since complete debridement of the root canals of the primary teeth is not practically possible due to the highly variable root canal anatomy, success of the endodontic therapy depends partly on the use ofantibacterial irrigating agents and root canal filling materials. Recent literature indicates that anaerobes comprise a majority of the bacteria in necrotic root canals ofprimary teeth. The study determined the antibacterial effectiveness of four root canal filling materials namely Calcium hydroxide, Zinc oxide eugenol, Vitapex and Metapex against microbial specimens obtained directly from necrotic root canals of primary teeth. METHOD: Microbial specimens were collected using sterile paper points, from 15 primary maxillary and mandibular posterior teeth of randomly selected children in the age group of 4-10 years with infected non vital primary teeth, requiring pulpectomy procedure. The microbial specimens collected were subjected to microbiological analysis and the antimicrobial potential of root canal filling materials were tested using Agar diffusion technique. RESULTS: were statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA. Facultative/Aerobic organisms were isolated in all the cases, anaerobic organisms were isolated in 80% of the cases, and Candida albicans was isolated in 1 case. ZOE showed superior inhibitory activity against most of the organisms isolated followed by Vitapex, Calcium hydroxide and Metapex in descending order. CONCLUSION: Our data may be useful as a guide for relative antimicrobial effectiveness or non-effectiveness of the materials employed. In vivo studies are required to state the specific antimicrobial activity and merits and demerits of any of the test filling material.
TI  - Specified species in gingival crevicular fluid predict bacterial diversity.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Analysis of gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples may give information of unattached (planktonic) subgingival bacteria. Our study represents the first one targeting the identity of bacteria in GCF. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We determined bacterial species diversity in GCF samples of a group of periodontitis patients and delineated contributing bacterial and host-associated factors. Subgingival paper point (PP) samples from the same sites were taken for comparison. After DNA extraction, 16S rRNA genes were PCR amplified and DNA-DNA hybridization was performed using a microarray for over 300 bacterial species or groups. Altogether 133 species from 41 genera and 8 phyla were detected with 9 to 62 and 18 to 64 species in GCF and PP samples, respectively, per patient. Projection to latent structures by means of partial least squares (PLS) was applied to the multivariate data analysis. PLS regression analysis showed that species of genera including Campylobacter, Selenomonas, Porphyromonas, Catonella, Tannerella, Dialister, Peptostreptococcus, Streptococcus and Eubacterium had significant positive correlations and the number of teeth with low-grade attachment loss a significant negative correlation to species diversity in GCF samples. OPLS/O2PLS discriminant analysis revealed significant positive correlations to GCF sample group membership for species of genera Campylobacter, Leptotrichia, Prevotella, Dialister, Tannerella, Haemophilus, Fusobacterium, Eubacterium, and Actinomyces. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Among a variety of detected species those traditionally classified as Gram-negative anaerobes growing in mature subgingival biofilms were the main predictors for species diversity in GCF samples as well as responsible for distinguishing GCF samples from PP samples. GCF bacteria may provide new prospects for studying dynamic properties of subgingival biofilms.
TI  - Oxygen tension modulates the cytokine response of oral epithelium to periodontal  bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an inverse relationship between pocket depth and pocket oxygen tension with deep pockets being associated with anaerobic bacteria. However, little is known about how the host tissues respond to bacteria under differing oxygen tensions within the periodontal pocket. AIM: To investigate the effect of different oxygen tensions upon nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation and the inflammatory cytokine response of oral epithelial cells when exposed to nine species of oral bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: H400 oral epithelial cells were equilibrated at 2%, 10% or 21% oxygen. Cells were stimulated with heat-killed oral bacteria at multiplicity of infection 10:1, Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (15 mug/ml) or vehicle control. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and NF-kappaB activation was measured by reporter vector or by immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: Tannerella forsythensis, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia elicited the greatest epithelial NF-kappaB activation and cytokine responses. An oxygen-tension-dependent trend in cytokine production was observed with the highest IL-8 and TNF-alpha production observed at 2% oxygen and lowest at 21% oxygen. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate a greater pro-inflammatory host response and cell signalling response to bacteria present in more anaerobic conditions, and hypersensitivity of epithelial cells to pro-inflammatory stimuli at 2% oxygen, which may have implications for disease pathogenesis and/or therapy.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide as an endodontic irrigant in a polymicrobial biofilm tooth model system.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to determine bactericidal efficacy of 0.04% stabilized chlorine dioxide, 3% sodium hypochlorite, 2% chlorhexidine gluconate, and sterile distilled water in a polymicrobial biofilm model. METHODS: Roots of 35 permanent bovine incisors had pulps extirpated, and their apical size and root length were standardized. Teeth were coated with mucin, inoculated with standardized suspensions of Streptococcus sanguinis, Actinomyces viscosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Prevotella nigrescens and incubated anaerobically. Teeth were randomly divided into four groups and rinsed for 3 minutes with 15 mL of irrigant. Biofilms were harvested and spiral-plated on selective media. Numbers of bacteria in the harvested biofilms was determined via the standard spiral-plating methodology. Treatment groups were evaluated using the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis procedure. Pair-wise comparisons among the four groups and five organisms were made using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney procedure. Adjustments for multiple comparisons were made using the Holm method with p < 0.05. RESULTS: Results provide strong evidence of a significant difference in levels of bactericidal activity associated with the type of irrigant for all five bacterial species tested. Levels of bactericidal activity were significantly higher for the NaOCl group than for the stabilized chlorine dioxide (ClO(2)) group for S. sanguinis, A. viscosus, and P. nigrescens. Results for F. nucleatum and P. micros were not significant after the adjustment for multiple comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: The triple-inoculation bovine tooth model system is a robust, consistent, and reproducible model system to study polymicrobial biofilms. It should be used with the knowledge expansion of biofilm structure and function as well as the development of antimicrobial protocols.
TI  - Microbiology of acute complicated bacterial sinusitis at the University of the Witwatersrand.
AB  - DESIGN: A retrospective chart review study at two referral hospitals identified 226 consecutive surgical patients with acute complicated sinusitis. SUBJECTS: One hundred and fifty-nine male and 67 female patients, with a mean age of 16.5 (standard deviation 0.7) years, underwent external fronto-ethmoidectomy with maxillary sinus washout and 13 had a concurrent craniotomy. RESULTS: A total of 233 micro-organisms were isolated from 163 patients(72.1%), and 63 (27.9%) were culture-negative. Positive isolates included Streptococcus milleri (18.5%), Staphylococcus aureus (12.4%), beta-haemolytic streptococci (10.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (8.6%), Haemophilus influenzae (8.6%) and the anaerobes, Peptostreptococcus (6.4%) and Prevotella (4.7%) species. The prevalences of S. pneumoniae (2.6%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (1.3%) and Moraxella catarrhalis (0.4%) were low. Polymicrobial disease was present in 56 patients (34.4%). There was a significant difference between the two hospitals in the prevalences of some bacteria (p<0.05). Antibiotic resistance was highest towards the penicillins (64.3%) and cephalosporins (12.5%). Effective empiric treatment was achieved with metronidazole and a choice of amoxicillin-clavulanate or ampicillin plus cloxacillin or penicillin plus chloramphenicol. CONCLUSION: The polymicrobial nature and severity of complicated sinusitis warrants a de-escalation approach to antimicrobial therapy. The combination of beta-lactamase-resistant penicillins and metronidazole is a reasonable choice for initial empiric antibacterial therapy. Selection of drugs for empirical antibiotic therapy in patients with acute complicated sinusitis should be supported by knowledge of the local prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients.
TI  - Subgingival microbial profiles of smokers with periodontitis.
AB  - The subgingival microbiome is largely uncultivated, and therefore, cultivation-based and targeted molecular approaches have limited value in examining the effect of smoking on this community. We tested the hypothesis that the subgingival biofilm is compositionally different in current and never-smokers by using an open-ended molecular approach for bacterial identification. Subgingival plaque from deep sites of current and never-smokers matched for disease was analyzed by 16S sequencing. Smokers demonstrated greater abundance of Parvimonas, Fusobacterium, Campylobacter, Bacteroides, and Treponema and lower levels of Veillonella, Neisseria, and Streptococcus. Several uncultivated Peptostreptococci, Parvimonas micra, Campylobacter gracilis, Treponema socranskii, Dialister pneumosintes, and Tannerella forsythia were elevated in this group, while Veillonella sp. oral clone B2, Neisseria sp. oral clone 2.24, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Capnocytophaga sp. clone AH015 were at lower levels. The microbial profile of smoking-associated periodontitis is distinct from that of non-smokers, with significant differences in the prevalence and abundance of disease-associated and health-compatible organisms.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease: the MONALISA study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin versus levofloxacin plus metronidazole in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease (uPID) in Asia. DESIGN: Prospective, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study. SETTING: Multicentre, multinational study in the inpatient and/or outpatient setting. POPULATION: Women (aged >/=18 years) with uPID (defined as PID with no pelvic or tubo-ovarian abscess on pelvic ultrasonography and at laparoscopic examination) and not requiring intravenous treatment. METHODS: Women received a 14-day course of either oral moxifloxacin, 400 mg once daily, or oral levofloxacin, 500 mg once daily, plus oral metronidazole, 500 mg twice daily. Additionally, a single dose of ceftriaxone, 250 mg intramuscularly, was administered to women who had a positive screening test for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary measure of efficacy was clinical response at test-of-cure (TOC) (7-14 days after the last dose of study drug) in the per-protocol population. Non-inferiority of moxifloxacin to the comparator regimen was demonstrated if lower limit of 95% CI was >-15%. Other measures were clinical response during therapy and at 4-week follow up, microbiological response at TOC, and safety. RESULTS: A total of 460 women were randomised to the study. For the primary measure of efficacy (clinical cure at TOC), moxifloxacin was noninferior to levofloxacin plus metronidazole (moxifloxacin: 152/194, 78.4%; comparator 155/190, 81.6%; 95% CI -10.7 to +4.9). The most commonly isolated pathogens at baseline included Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Peptostreptococcus spp., Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus agalactiae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Bacteriological success rates were high and comparable between treatment arms (microbiologically valid populations, moxifloxacin 27/30, 90.0%; comparator 22/26, 84.6%; 95% CI -12.7 to +20.3). Both treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Moxifloxacin monotherapy, 400 mg once daily for 14 days, is an effective and well-tolerated oral treatment for women with uPID.
TI  - Competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains. Four probiotic bacterial species (Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium) were isolated from yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. RESULTS: Fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. In addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', Streptococcus sanguinis. The competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. When probiotics were inoculated first, Bifidobacterium inhibited Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas circumdentaria, and Prevotella nigrescens; L. acidophilus inhibited P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. circumdentaria, P. nigrescens, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius; L. bulgaricus inhibited P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and P. nigrescens; and S. thermophilus inhibited P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, and P. nigrescens. However, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens) were inoculated simultaneously. When periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, Prevotella intermedia inhibited Bifidobacterium and S. thermophilus. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.
TI  - Lemierre-like syndrome: a series of unique cases.
AB  
TI  - A pediatric patient with acute suppurative thyroiditis caused by Eikenella corrodens.
AB  - A previously healthy 6-year-old boy had continuous fever for 6 days before admission to our hospital. His general condition was good except for pyrexia. The left lobe of the thyroid gland was swollen, red, hot, and tender, and neck movement was limited. The provisional diagnosis was upper respiratory tract infection. We demonstrated the existence of an orifice of the left piriform sinus by esophagography in this case, and made a diagnosis of acute suppurative thyroiditis caused by a piriform sinus fistula in the hypopharynx. The causative organisms of acute suppurative thyroiditis include Peptostreptococcus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and alpha-streptococcus, but the organisms responsible are commonly undetectable in clinical cases. We detected Eikenella corrodens in the present patient. Although Eikenella species occasionally causes acute suppurative thyroiditis in adults, it is rare for this to happen in pediatric patients. Antibiotics were administered for 7 days. We also performed aspiration of the abscess on the 8th day of the illness. The abscess was reduced in size and tenderness was relieved after aspiration. In conclusion, if a pediatric patient has swelling, heat, tenderness, and redness of the anterior neck, we should keep in mind acute suppurative thyroiditis and the possibility of a fistula. If there is an abscess, we should immediately perform aspiration, culture, and isolation, and choose the appropriate antibiotics for the causative bacteria.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility and resistance of the odontogenic microbiological spectrum and its clinical impact on severe deep space head and neck infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this retrospective study was to identify the major pathogens responsible for deep space head and neck infections and their current resistance to routinely used antibiotics in a university hospital setting. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 206 patients suffering from odontogenic deep space infections were treated at our department by means of surgical intervention and intravenous administration of antibiotics. RESULTS: The predominant bacteria were viridans group streptococci (VGS), staphylococci, Prevotella, Peptostreptococcus, and Bacteroides. In the aerobic spectrum, resistance against clindamycin was found in 18%, against macrolides in 14%, and against penicillin G in 7%. The anaerobes were resistant to clindamycin in 11%, to metronidazole in 6%, and to penicillin G in 8%. CONCLUSION: The high resistance rate for clindamycin and macrolides was especially striking and may necessitate an adaptation of our antibiotic regime in the future.
TI  - Development of a novel PCR method to comprehensively analyze salivary bacterial flora and its application to patients with odontogenic infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop a novel polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method to comprehensively analyze salivary bacterial flora. STUDY DESIGN: The bacterial flora in the saliva of 10 healthy persons and 11 patients with odontogenic infections were examined using a DNA extraction method with a high level of cell destruction efficiency and a novel universal primer set to amplify approximately 580 bp of the 16S rDNA sequence. RESULTS: Streptococcus (54.5%), Neisseria (14.7%), Actinomyces (8.4%), Gemella (4.1%), Granulicatella (3.8%), and Prevotella (1.4%) were dominant in a total of 1655 clones examined from the saliva of the healthy subjects. The dominant genera differed among the patients with odontogenic infections (a total of 823 clones) and were entirely different from those of the healthy subjects. CONCLUSION: This novel comprehensive salivary bacterial flora analysis method may be a useful supportive method to identify causative agents of odontogenic infections.
TI  - Anterior chest wall abscess--an unusual complication of an odontogenic infection.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A majority of odontogenic infections can be successfully managed with routine incision and drainage and empirical antibiotics. Sometimes an odontogenic infection may spread to contiguous spaces and descend along the neck causing significant morbidity and rarely even mortality. CASE REPORT: We report a case of an odontogenic infection which had an unusual spread to the anterior chest wall.
TI  - Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, cloning, and sequence analysis of bacteria associated with acute periapical abscesses in children.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), cloning, and sequencing were applied to the microbiologic study of acute periapical abscesses of endodontic origin in children to examine the predominant bacteria. METHODS: Purulent material was collected from 11 children diagnosed with acute abscesses of endodontic origin, and DNA was extracted to evaluate the predominant bacteria by using PCR-DGGE, cloning, and sequence analysis. RESULTS: Bacterial DNA was present in all of the 11 purulence samples. The microflora of clinical purulence samples were profiled by the PCR-DGGE method, and overall 17 bacterial genera were identified. The number of bacterial phylotypes in the purulence samples ranged from 1-8 (mean, 5.5). The most dominant genera found were Prevotella (24%), Fusobacterium (17.7%), Porphyromonas (13.9%), Lactobacillus (11.3%), Peptostreptococcus (8.3%), Streptococcus (6.4%), Eubacterium (3.8%), Campylobacter (3.3%), Treponema (2.6%), and Bulleidia (2.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The DGGE allowed visualization of the bacterial qualitative composition and revealed the major bacteria in the samples. The dominant bacteria associated with acute periapical abscess examined by PCR-DGGE, cloning, and sequencing methods are similar to those of culture-dependent studies. Although PCR-DGGE, cloning, and sequencing methods detected some bacteria at lower proportions than are unreported by culture methods, the method has the disadvantage of low resolution and is too time-consuming and laborious and more expensive.
TI  - Osteoradionecrosis contains a wide variety of cultivable and non-cultivable bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Direct microscopy, anaerobic culture and DNA-DNA hybridization have previously demonstrated an association between microorganisms and osteoradionecrosis (ORN). The purpose of our study was to use culture independent molecular techniques to detect bacteria in necrotic bone lesions of the mandible after radiation therapy. DESIGN: Bacterial DNA was extracted from eight deep medullar specimens from resected mandibles (six cases), including one patient with relapse. 16S rRNA genes were PCR amplified, cloned, transformed into Escherichia coli and sequenced to determine species identity and closest relatives. RESULTS: From the analysis of 438 clones, 59 predominant species were detected, 27% of which have not been cultivated. The predominant species detected from radionecrotic mandibles were Campylobacter gracilis, Streptococcus intermedius, Peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone FG014, uncultured bacterium clone RL178, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella spp. The study demonstrated intersubject variability of the bacteria present in ORN. In contrast to the diverse bacterial profile detected in primary infection, only a few members of the oral indigenous flora were identified from the relapse case. CONCLUSIONS: Diverse bacterial profiles in specimens of ORN in marrow spaces of the mandible were detected by culture independent molecular techniques. To better understand the pathogenesis and to improve the therapy of the infection, detection of all members of the complex bacterial flora associated with ORN is necessary.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of the antimicrobial efficacy of aloe vera tooth gel and two popular commercial toothpastes: an in vitro study.
AB  - Aloe vera (Aloe barbadensis Miller) has been suggested for a wide variety of ailments but its use in dentistry is limited. This article reviews the uses of the plant and describes an in vitro investigation that compared the antimicrobial effectiveness of aloe vera tooth gel with two popular, commercially available dentifrices. The preliminary results showed that aloe vera tooth gel and the toothpastes were equally effective against Candida albicans, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. Aloe vera tooth gel demonstrated enhanced antibacterial effect against S. mitis.
TI  - Comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (RP) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (GRs = good responders) or periodontal health (PH) using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). METHODS: At baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with PH and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM. The subjects with periodontitis were classified as having RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or more than three sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GRs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after treatment. Significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis and chi(2) tests. RESULTS: More species were detected in patients with disease (GR or RP) than in those without disease (PH). Subjects with RP were distinguished from GRs or those with PH by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Campylobacter gracilis, Eubacterium nodatum, Selenomonas noxia, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Treponema spp., and Eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, TM7 spp. oral taxon [OT] 346/356, Bacteroidetes sp. OT 272/274, Solobacterium moorei, Desulfobulbus sp. OT 041, Brevundimonas diminuta, Sphaerocytophaga sp. OT 337, Shuttleworthia satelles, Filifactor alocis, Dialister invisus/pneumosintes, Granulicatella adiacens, Mogibacterium timidum, Veillonella atypica, Mycoplasma salivarium, Synergistes sp. cluster II, and Acidaminococcaceae [G-1] sp. OT 132/150/155/148/135) (P <0.05). Species that were more prevalent in subjects with PH than in patients with periodontitis included Actinomyces sp. OT 170, Actinomyces spp. cluster I, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Lautropia mirabilis, Propionibacterium propionicum, Rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and Streptococcus sanguinis (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: As determined by HOMIM, patients with RP presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the GR and PH groups.
TI  - The bacteriology of salivary gland infections.
AB  - The parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. However, infection of the salivary glands can occur in any of the glands. The most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial infection are Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. The predominant anaerobes include: anaerobic Gram negative bacilli (eg, pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas); Fusobacterium spp; and Peptostreptococcus spp. In addition, Streptococcus spp (including Streptococcus pneumoniae) and aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli (including Escherichia coli) have been reported. Aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli are often seen in hospitalized patients. Organisms less frequently found are Haemophilus influenzae, Treponema pallidum, Bartonella henselae, and Eikenella corrodens. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of infection. The choice of antibiotics should be guided by identification of the etiologic agent.
TI  - Molecular analysis of persistent periradicular lesions and root ends reveals a diverse microbial profile.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The microbial etiology of periradicular lesions is recognized; however, the bacterial profile of these lesions is not well elucidated. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of bacterial colonization in these lesions and to characterize the bacterial community present in root ends and periradicular lesions. METHODS: Thirty-four adult patients who presented for apicoectomy of persistent periradicular lesions after endodontic therapy were selected for the study and samples of periradicular tissue and resected root ends collected. Total bacterial levels were estimated for 34 paired periradicular lesions and root ends using real-time polymerase chain reaction with universal bacterial primers. Sixteen pairs of these samples were analyzed using ribosomal 16S cloning and sequencing for bacterial identification. RESULTS: Bacteria were detected more consistently and at higher levels in root ends. Periradicular lesions exhibited a diverse microbial profile with many uncultivated phylotypes. Enterococcus faecalis and Burkholderia cepacia predominated in both samples. Campylobacter gracilis and Streptococcus gordonii were associated with root ends, whereas Atopobium rimae, Peptostreptococcus micros, Streptococcus genomospecies C8, Dialister sp E2_20 E1, and Eubacterium strain A35MT were associated with periradicular lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent periradicular lesions are polymicrobial infections with many as-yet-uncultivated and unknown bacterial species. The bacterial load and microbial profile of root ends is significantly different from the soft-tissue lesion, indicating the presence of diverse bacterial populations in these tissues.
TI  - [Oral cavity microbiocenose in healthy teenagers and patients with chronic gastritis and gastroduodenitis].
AB  - Microbial association distinctive features and colonization degree of different oral cavity biotope were established in healthy teenagers and patients with chronic gastritis and gastroduodenitis. There were studied mucous membrane surfaces of cheek, tongue, content of gingival crevice, oral fluid and dental plaque of 24 healthy persons of the age 12-17 years and 29 patients of the same age with gastritis and gastroduodenitis. On the mucous membranes of the ill teenagers there were found Porphiromonas type bacteria, 20% more Staphylococcus, 90% less Peptostreptococcus, 30% less Lactobacillus, 20% less Veillonella and Stomatococcus. In saliva anaerobic Peptostreptococcus and facultative anaerobic Streptococcus (7 lg COE/ml); Porphiromonas, Veillonella, Peptococcus and Staphylococcus (6 lg COE/ml); Neisseria (5 lg COE/ml); Stomatococcus, Enterobacteriaceae and Bacillus (4.6 lg COE/ml); Lactobacillus and Candida (4 lg COE/ml) predominated. In patients with chronic pathology in all tested biotopes there was found the increase of the whole microbiota spectra (representatives of opportunistic pathogenic microfiora were detected more often) as well as the bacteria number if compared with healthy teenagers.
TI  - The effects of treatment of acute otitis media with a low dose vs a high dose of  amoxicillin on the nasopharyngeal flora.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects on the nasopharyngeal flora of therapy of acute otitis media in children with either a low dose or a high dose of amoxicillin. DESIGN: Retrospective study. PATIENTS: Of 50 children diagnosed as having acute otitis media, 25 received a low dose of amoxicillin (45 mg/kg/d) (group 1) and 25 received a high dose of amoxicillin (90 mg/kg/d) (group 2) for 10 days, and both groups were evaluated. INTERVENTION: Antimicrobial treatment. RESULTS: Before therapy, potential pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus) were isolated from the nasopharynx of 15 children in group 1 (60%) and 13 in group 2 (52%). The number of penicillin-susceptible isolates was equally reduced after both therapies. However, an increase was noted in the recovery of S aureus only in group 2 (from 2 to 6 organisms). A greater eradication rate of interfering organisms following therapy was noted in group 2 (from 86 to 36) than in group 1 (from 92 to 60) (P < .001). These organisms include alpha-hemolytic streptococci, and Peptostreptococcus and Prevotella species. CONCLUSIONS: The oral flora at the end of therapy with a high dose of amoxicillin is more depleted of organisms with interfering capability than following treatment with a low dose of amoxicillin. These changes may contribute to the greater recovery rate of patients infected with S aureus who received a high dose of amoxicillin.
TI  - The microbiota on different oral surfaces in healthy children.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. METHODS: Microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the Dental School of the University of Athens, who were split into three age groups. A total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique. RESULTS: All of the test species, except Parvimonas micra and Porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial profiles for the different oral surfaces. Supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of Actinomyces species and Green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the Yellow complex. The profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. Many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. Periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. Specifically, the Red complex species (Tannerella forsythia, P. gingivalis, Treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (P < 0.05) in all sample locations. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. Differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of Orange and Red complex species.
TI  - [Experimental vaginal dysbiosis on the model of white laboratory mice].
AB  - Qualitative and quantitative composition of microbiocenosis of urogenital tract (UGT) of mice has been studied. When investigating UGT of mice in norm (n = 8), microorganisms of several genera with following occurrence frequency were detected: Lactobacillus (100%), Streptococcus (100%), Staphylococcus (87.5%), Micrococcus (12.5%), Bacillus (12.5%), Fusobacterium (87.5%), Peptococcus (62.5%), Peptostreptococcus (50%), Bacteroides (100%) and representatives of Enterobacteriaceae f (12.5%) family. A comparative analysis of UGT microflora in norm and under physiologically proceeding pregnancy helped to detect in the group of pregnant animals the increase of occurrence frequency of such conventionally-pathogenous organisms as representatives of Enterobacteriaceae family (6.86) and Peptococcus genus (1.37 times), representatives of Lactobacillus genus were found in 100% of animals. A possibility of UGT dysbiosis under microbialload made by the method of intravaginal introduction of 50 mkl of Staphilococcus aureus culture suspension which contains 1 x 109 cells/ml has been established. It was shown that clinical symptoms of dysbiosis (increase of pH, excretions at UGT outlet) correlate with disturbances in microbiocenosis of mice UGT which are characterized by a decrease of occurrence frequency and titer of saprophyte microorganisms, first of all, Lactobacillus (occurrence frequency decreased 15 times for anaerobic and 1.33 times for microaerophylic, and titers 1.32 times and 2.34 times, respectively), and by an increase of the titer of conventionally pathogenic bacteria, such as representatives of Enterobacteriaceae family (14.5 times) and Staphylococcus (6.17 times). Investigation of the effect of exogenic staphylococcal load on pregnancy has shown that the development of UGT dysbiosis affects the pregnancy result. Thus, it was established that there were three cases of abortion and two cases of natimortality which were registered in the group of female mice (n = 5) which were administered Staphylococcus after they became pregnant. The paper is presented in Russian.
TI  - Branchial cleft cysts in adults. Diagnostic procedures and treatment in a series  of 18 cases.
AB  - PURPOSE: Branchial cleft anomalies may be presented as branchial cysts, fistulas, or sinuses. Purpose of this paper is to present the diagnostic procedures and the treatment in a series of branchial cleft cysts. METHODS: Eighteen patients with branchial cleft cysts were surgically treated. All of them were subjected in laboratory examinations with ultrasonography, CT or/and MRI, and fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). Complete excision was the treatment in all cases. RESULTS: Eight patients had Type I, seven Type II, two Type III, and one a Type IV cyst. In all cases the surgical removal was successful and after 1 to 7 years post-surgical follow-up, no recurrences have been developed. CONCLUSIONS: Branchial cleft cyst diagnostic procedure must be the same as for other neck swellings. FNAC is very useful for the diagnosis and the surgical approach must ensure safe and complete cyst removal in order to avoid intraoperative complications and recurrences.
TI  - Does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. METHODS: Bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (BOP) was recorded at sites sampled at the four time points. RESULTS: The mean BOP at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. The corresponding mean BOP at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). Total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (P <0.01). Increased bacterial counts over time were found for Neisseria mucosa (P <0.001). Lower counts (P <0.001) were found for Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, Leptotrichia buccalis, Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Selenomonas noxia, and Veillonella parvula. No changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. Counts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), and Treponema denticola did not change. Counts of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. P. gingivalis and T. forsythia counts were associated with BOP at week 12. A decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. Only counts of N. mucosa increased.
TI  - The ability of non-bacteriocin producing Streptococcus bovis strains to bind and  transfer bovicin HC5 to other sensitive bacteria.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis HC5 produces a broad spectrum lantibiotic (bovicin HC5), but  S. bovis JB1 does not have antimicrobial activity. Preliminary experiments revealed an anomaly. When S. bovis JB1 cells were washed in stationary phase S. bovis HC5 cell-free culture supernatant, the S. bovis JB1 cells were subsequently able to inhibit hyper-ammonia producing ruminal bacteria (Clostridium sticklandii, Clostridium aminophilum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius). Other non-bacteriocin producing S. bovis strains also had the ability to bind and transfer semi-purified bovicin HC5. Bovicin HC5 that was bound to S. bovis JB1 was much more resistant to Pronase E than cell-free bovicin HC5, but it could be inactivated if the incubation period was 24 h. Acidic NaCl treatment (100 mM, pH 2.0) liberates half of the bovicin HC5 from S. bovis HC5, but it did not prevent bovicin HC5 from binding to S. bovis JB1. Acidic NaCl liberated some bovicin HC5 from S. bovis JB1, but the decrease in activity was only 2-fold. Bovicin HC5 is a positively charged peptide, and the ability of S. bovis JB1 to bind bovicin HC5 could be inhibited by either calcium or magnesium (100 mM). Acidic NaCl-treated S. bovis JB1 cells were unable to accumulate potassium, but they were still able to bind bovicin HC5 and prevent potassium accumulation by untreated S. bovis JB1 cells. Based on these results, bovicin HC5 bound to S. bovis JB1 cells still acts as a pore-forming lantibiotic.

TI  - The microbiota of acute apical abscesses.
AB  - As the breadth of bacterial diversity in the oral cavity has been deciphered by molecular studies, several newly identified species/phylotypes have emerged as potential pathogens. We hypothesized that many of these species/phylotypes could also be involved with the etiology of endodontic abscesses. Abscess aspirates from 42 persons were analyzed for the presence of 81 species/phylotypes by means of a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. Associations between the most frequently detected taxa were calculated. The most prevalent taxa were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, and Porphyromonas endodontalis. Other frequently found taxa included Olsenella uli, streptococci, Eikenella corrodens, some as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes (Bacteroidetes clone X083 and Synergistes clone BA121), and newly named species (Prevotella baroniae and Dialister invisus). Several positive bacterial associations were disclosed. Findings not only strengthen the association of many cultivable species with abscesses, but also include some newly named species and uncultivated phylotypes in the set of candidate pathogens associated with this disease.
TI  - Sudden onset proptosis secondary to cavernous sinus thrombosis from underlying mandibular dental infection.
AB  - The present report concerns a patient who presented with a 4-day history of left-sided facial pain arising from a pre-existing dental infection and progressive shortness of breath. The patient had a previous diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and was being treated with methotrexate. The rapid development of a right eye proptosis necessitated urgent decompression with a lateral canthotomy and cantholysis. Imaging revealed a left facial abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST), bilateral internal jugular thrombosis and multiple lung abscesses. Blood cultures yielded Streptococcus constellatus, a member of the Peptostreptococcus family. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure and septic shock. She was treated with intravenous meropenem and clindamycin, and anticoagulated. Despite early intervention, the patient developed a middle cerebral artery infarct. Over a 3-week period she was gradually weaned from vasopressor and ventilatory support.
TI  - Bacterial diversity in persistent periapical lesions on root-filled teeth.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to analyze the bacterial diversity in persistent apical lesions on root-filled teeth by using culture-independent molecular methods. DESIGN: Twenty surgically removed apical lesions from therapy-resistant teeth were examined for the presence of bacterial DNA using PCR targeting the 16s ribosomal RNA gene, followed by cloning and sequencing. RESULTS: Bacterial DNA was detected in 17 of the 20 samples (85%). A total of 236 clones were analyzed. Seven different bacterial phyla were represented and a total of 75 different bacterial taxa were identified; 36% of the species have not yet been cultivated. Commonly detected bacterial species included Fusobacterium spp., Prevotella spp., Tannerella forsythia, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Treponema denticola, Bacteroidetes spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. CONCLUSIONS: A wide range of bacteria was identified in periapical lesions on therapy-resistant teeth. These bacteria may contribute in the etiology of periapical infection and impede healing of these lesions.

TI  - Correlates of periodontal decline and biologic markers in older adults.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is limited information on infectious and host responses distinguishing older people with or without active periodontitis. This study measured bacterial and serum cytokine and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels in older persons. METHODS: Elders (mean age: 67 years), whose periodontal status had declined most or least (20% worst or 20% best) over 5 years, were enrolled. Two years later, they were classified as periodontally declining (active periodontitis [AP]), if they had at least five teeth with probing depth (PD) > or =5 mm, or stable (stable periodontally [SP]), if they did not. Groups were compared with respect to demographics, PD, clinical loss of attachment, subgingival bacteria, serum hsCRP, interleukin (IL)-1beta and -6, and chronic diseases. RESULTS: Ten AP and 24 SP subjects were identified; 13% of women and 44% of men from the original sample were in the AP group (P <0.05). Most Asians were SP; most whites and all African Americans were classified as having AP (P <0.01). More AP elders had osteoporosis (P <0.01), but the AP and SP groups did not differ with respect to IL-1beta and -6 or hsCRP. Bacterial counts were higher in the AP group for Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros) (7.7 x 10(5) cells versus 3.8 x 10(5) cells; P <0.05), Prevotella intermedia (25.7 x 10(5) cells versus 9.8 x 10(5) cells; P <0.01), Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis) (16.2 x 10(5) cells versus 8.0 x 10(5) cells; P <0.05), and Streptococcus mutans (6.2 x 10(5) cells versus 2.0 x 10(5) cells; P <0.01). Three risk factors were most predictive of periodontal decline: PD, osteoporosis, and being white or African American. CONCLUSION: Periodontal decline was associated with osteoporosis, ethnicity, PD, gender, serum hsCRP, and levels of four bacterial species.
TI  - Polymicrobial nature of chronic diabetic foot ulcer biofilm infections determined using bacterial tag encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing (bTEFAP).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic extremity ulcers are associated with chronic infections. Such ulcer infections are too often followed by amputation because there is little or no understanding of the ecology of such infections or how to control or eliminate this type of chronic infection. A primary impediment to the healing of chronic wounds is biofilm phenotype infections. Diabetic foot ulcers are the most common, disabling, and costly complications of diabetes. Here we seek to derive a better understanding of the polymicrobial nature of chronic diabetic extremity ulcer infections. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using a new bacterial tag encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing (bTEFAP) approach we have evaluated the bacterial diversity of 40 chronic diabetic foot ulcers from different patients. The most prevalent bacterial genus associated with diabetic chronic wounds was Corynebacterium spp. Findings also show that obligate anaerobes including Bacteroides, Peptoniphilus, Fingoldia, Anaerococcus, and Peptostreptococcus spp. are ubiquitous in diabetic ulcers, comprising a significant portion of the wound biofilm communities. Other major components of the bacterial communities included commonly cultured genera such as Streptococcus, Serratia, Staphylococcus and Enterococcus spp. CONCLUSIONS: In this article, we highlight the patterns of population diversity observed in the samples and introduce preliminary evidence to support the concept of functional equivalent pathogroups (FEP). Here we introduce FEP as consortia of genotypically distinct bacteria that symbiotically produce a pathogenic community. According to this hypothesis, individual members of these communities when they occur alone may not cause disease but when they coaggregate or consort together into a FEP the synergistic effect provides the functional equivalence of well-known pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, giving the biofilm community the factors necessary to maintain chronic biofilm infections. Further work is definitely warranted and needed in order to prove whether the FEPs concept is a viable hypothesis. The findings here also suggest that traditional culturing methods may be extremely biased as a diagnostic tool as they select for easily cultured organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus and against difficult to culture bacteria such as anaerobes. While PCR methods also have bias, further work is now needed in comparing traditional culture results to high-resolution molecular diagnostic methods such as bTEFAP.
TI  - Bacteriological and clinical evaluation of twelve cases of post-surgical sepsis of odontogenic tumours at a referral centre.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the bacterial aetiology of sepsis occurring following surgery of odontogenic tumours and assess the effect of prompt and proper antibiotic usage. DESIGN: A prospective study. SETTING: A tertiary referral centre in Lagos, Nigeria. SUBJECTS: Twelve patients with odontogenic tumours that developed sepsis postoperatively. Eight of the patients were referred from private hospitals, the remaining were in-patients who sought for alternative medical attention following interruption of health care services at the referral centre. INTERVENTION: Adequate review of patient's medical history, bacteriological investigations and antibiotic therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Bacteriological and clinical cure following antibiotic therapy based on susceptibility test results. RESULTS: Two categories of patients were identified; those who completed the course of antibiotics prescribed post-surgery and patients who failed to conform to antibiotic prescription. Sepsis developed in the non-compliance group much earlier than in the group that complied (p<0.001). Infections were polybacterial with aerobes accounting for 77.4% (alpha-haemolytic streptococci 29.0%, Streptococcus pyogenes 16.1%, Staphylococcus aureus 16.1%, diphtheroids 9.7%, Klebsiella pneumoniae 6.5%) and anaerobes 22.6% (Porphyromonas gingivalis 9.7%, Peptostreptococcus spp. 6.5%, Prevotella melaninogenica 3.2%, Clostridium perfringens 3.2%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic aetiology occurred more in osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma. Clostridium perfringens was isolated from a case of osteosarcoma with necrotic tissues. The anaerobic bacteria were 100% sensitive to metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and augmentin, 65-85% sensitivity to ampicloxacillin, amoxicillin and erythromycin. Over 92% of the streptococci were sensitive to the beta-Lactams contrast low susceptibility with S. aureus and K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: Interruption of healthcare service was the sole factor identified in the development of sepsis as the patients could not be monitored to ensure compliance to prescription.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
AB  - Human beta-defensin-3 (HBD3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. This study aimed to obtain recombinant HBD3 (rHBD3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of HBD3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. Genetic engineering was used to obtain active rHBD3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella melaninogenica, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces naeslundii, Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans. In an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rHBD3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. The ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. We conclude that HBD3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.
TI  - Evolutional selection of a combinatorial phage library displaying randomly-rearranged various single domains of immunoglobulin (Ig)-binding proteins (IBPs) with four kinds of Ig molecules.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Protein A, protein G and protein L are three well-defined immunoglobulin (Ig)-binding proteins (IBPs), which show affinity for specific sites on Ig of mammalian hosts. Although the precise functions of these molecules are not fully understood, it is thought that they play an important role in pathogenicity of bacteria. The single domains of protein A, protein G and protein L were all demonstrated to have function to bind to Ig. Whether combinations of Ig-binding domains of various IBPs could exhibit useful novel binding is interesting. RESULTS: We used a combinatorial phage library which displayed randomly-rearranged various-peptide-linked molecules of D and A domains of protein A, designated PA(D) and PA(A) respectively, B2 domain of protein G (PG) and B3 domain of protein L (PL) for affinity selection with human IgG (hIgG), human IgM (hIgM), human IgA (hIgA) and recombinant hIgG1-Fc as bait respectively. Two kinds of novel combinatorial molecules with characteristic structure of PA(A)-PG and PA(A)-PL were obtained in hIgG (hIgG1-Fc) and hIgM (hIgA) post-selection populations respectively. In addition, the linking peptides among all PA(A)-PG and PA(A)-PL structures was strongly selected, and showed interestingly divergent and convergent distribution. The phage binding assays and competitive inhibition experiments demonstrated that PA(A)-PG and PA(A)-PL combinations possess comparable binding advantages with hIgG/hIgG1-Fc and hIgM/hIgA respectively. CONCLUSION: In this work, a combinatorial phage library displaying Ig-binding domains of protein A, protein G, or protein L joined by various random linking peptides was used to conducted evolutional selection in vitro with four kinds of Ig molecules. Two kinds of novel combinations of Ig-binding domains, PA(A)-PG and PA(A)-PL, were obtained, and demonstrate the novel Ig binding properties.
TI  - Formulation and evaluation of PLA and PLGA in situ implants containing secnidazole and/or doxycycline for treatment of periodontitis.
AB  - The purpose of this study is to formulate in situ implants containing doxycycline hydrochloride and/or secnidazole that could be used in the treatment of periodontitis by direct periodontal intrapocket administration. Biodegradable polymers [poly (lactide) (PLA) and poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA)], each polymer in two concentrations 25%w/w, 35%w/w were used to formulate the in situ implants. The rheological behavior, in vitro drug release and the antimicrobial activity of the prepared implants were evaluated. Increasing the concentration of each polymer increases the viscosity and decreases the percent of the drugs released after 24 h. PLA implants showed a slower drugs release rate than PLGA implants in which the implants composed of 25% PLGA showed the fastest drugs release. The in vitro drug release and antimicrobial activity results were compared with results of Atridox. Results revealed that the pharmaceutical formulation based on 25% PLGA containing secnidazole and doxycycline hydrochloride has promising activity in treating periodontitis in comparison with Atridox.
TI  - A case of necrotizing fasciitis due to Streptococcus agalactiae, Arcanobacterium  haemolyticum, and Finegoldia magna in a dog-bitten patient with diabetes.
AB  - We report a case of necrotizing fasciitis involving Streptococcus agalactiae, Arcanobacterium haemolyticum, and Finegoldia magna in a 36-yr-old female diabetic patient, which started after a minor dog bite to the toe of the patient. This case suggested that a trivial infection after a minor dog bite in an immunocompromised patient such as diabetes patient could result in a significant complication such as necrotizing fasciitis. The life-threatening infection was cured by timely above-the-knee amputation, as well as penicillin G and clindamycin therapy.
TI  - Changes in abundance of Lactobacillus spp. and Streptococcus suis in the stomach, jejunum and ileum of piglets after weaning.
AB  - This present study investigated the changes in bacterial community composition, with an emphasis on Lactobacillus spp. and Streptococcus suis populations as potentially beneficial and harmful groups, in the stomach, jejunum and ileum of piglets after weaning (21 days postpartum) by 16S rRNA gene-based methods. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis showed that, after weaning, predominant bands related to Lactobacillus spp. disappeared and were replaced by potential pathogenic species, such as Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Moraxella cuniculi, S. suis and Porphyromonas catoniae. Real-time PCR revealed that the abundances of lactobacilli and Lactobacillus sobrius as a proportion of total bacterial abundance were significantly lower in the stomach, jejunum and ileum of weaned piglets than in 21-day-old piglets. A specific and sensitive real-time PCR assay was developed for quantification of the important pathogen S. suis within gastrointestinal microbiota. The assay showed that S. suis predominated in the stomach samples of weaned piglets with population levels up to 10(7) copies g(-1) digesta, while it was not detected in the stomach before weaning. Streptococcus suis was not dominant in the jejunum and ileum digesta before weaning, but became dominant after weaning, with population levels up to 10(7) copies g(-1) digesta. The results demonstrated for the first time the postweaning dominance of the potentially harmful S. suis in piglet intestine. The results also suggest that the defensive barrier of the stomach can be impaired as S. suis became dominant while the proportion of Lactobacillus populations decreased after weaning, which may further result in an increase of S. suis abundance in the intestine.
TI  - Campylobacter species isolated from extra-oro-intestinal abscesses: a report of four cases and literature review.
AB  - Campylobacter species are frequently isolated from fecal specimens of patients with diarrheal illness. Several Campylobacter species are commonly isolated from the oral cavity. In contrast, Campylobacter species are rarely isolated from extra-oro-intestinal abscesses. Reported here are four cases of extra-oro-intestinal abscesses due to polymicrobial flora, including Campylobacter species. The first case is a 35-year-old woman who was diagnosed with a brain abscess caused by C. gracilis, Streptococcus constellatus, and anaerobic Gram-positive cocci. The second case is a 65-year-old man with a history of maxillary sinus carcinoma who developed a brain abscess due to polymicrobial flora, including C. concisus. The third case is a 24-year-old male who was diagnosed with a vertebral abscess caused by C. rectus, Eubacterium brachy, and Actinomyces species. The fourth case is a 74-year-old woman who presented with an intraorbital abscess due to C. showae and Micromonas (previously Peptostreptococcus) micros. The first two patients died from a cause directly related to their abscesses. All Campylobacter species involved in the four cases were isolated anaerobically. The isolation of oral Campylobacter species, e.g., C. rectus and C. showae, from abscesses suggests an oral source. A survey of the English literature was undertaken to identify reports of Campylobacter species isolated from extra-oro-intestinal abscesses.
TI  - Assessment of the microbiota in root canals of human primary teeth by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate in vivo the prevalence of microorganisms in root canals of human primary teeth, by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. METHODS: Fifty-five root canals of primary teeth with irreversible pulpitis (group 1) and 51 root canals of teeth with pulp necrosis and apical periodontitis (group 2) were selected. Microbiological samples were collected and submitted to checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization using 34 genomic DNA probes. The results were analyzed statistically by Mann-Whitney U-test at a 5% significance level. RESULTS: The most prevalent species in group 1 were: (1) Campylobacter rectus (87%); (2) Gemella morbilorum (78%); (3) Streptococcus gordonii (71%); (4) Capnocytophaga ochracea (69%); (5) Treponema denticola (58%); and (6) Streptococcus intermedius (49%). The most prevalent species in group 2 were: (1) C. rectus (90%); (2) T. denticola (88%); (3) S. intermedius (77%); (4) G. morbilorum (73%); (5) Streptococcus oralis (67%); (6) C. ochracea (63%); (7) S. gordonii (55%); (8) Streptococcus mitis (51%); and (9) Leptotrichia buccalis (51%). Except for Peptostreptococcus micros and Actinomyces israelii, the most prevalent bacterial strains in the root canals with apical periodontitis were also those found in larger numbers (P<.05). Groups 1 and 2 differed significantly (P<.05) regarding the total number of bacterial cells detected in the root canal samples, with group 2 showing remarkably larger bacterial cell numbers. CONCLUSIONS: Root canals of primary teeth have a great bacterial diversity, characterizing a polymicrobial endodontic infection with presence of: (1) anaerobic and facultative micro organisms; (2) black-pigmented rods; and (3) streptococci. A large number of anaerobic species were detected in teeth with necrotic pulp and apical periodontitis, and a significantly smaller number of bacterial cells were found in teeth with irreversible pulpitis.
TI  - Infection associated with hematoma formation after shoulder arthroplasty.
AB  - Hematoma formation requiring operative treatment after shoulder arthroplasty may  be associated with higher patient morbidity. We therefore determined whether there was an association of hematoma formation requiring operative treatment with deep infection after shoulder arthroplasty. Between 1978 and 2006, we performed 4147 shoulder arthroplasties in 3643 patients. Of these, 12 shoulders (0.3%) underwent reoperation for hematoma formation. The mean time interval from arthroplasty to surgery for the hematoma was 7 days (range, 0.5-31 days). Among nine cases in which cultures were taken, six had positive cultures; the organisms included Propionibacterium acnes in three, Staphylococcus epidermidis in one, Streptococcus species in one, and Staphylococcus epidermidis with Peptostreptococcus in one. The minimum followup was 12 months (mean, 68 months; range, 12 to 294 months). Two of the 12 patients eventually underwent resection arthroplasty for deep infection. The Neer score was excellent in one, satisfactory in six, and unsatisfactory in five patients. The data suggest hematoma formation after shoulder arthroplasty is often accompanied by positive intraoperative cultures. The surgeon should be aware of the high rate of unsatisfactory results associated with this complication as well as the possibility of developing a deep infection requiring additional surgery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, prognostic study. See Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.
TI  - A retrospective analysis of isolates from patients with vaginitis in a private Greek obstetric/gynecological hospital (2003-2006).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaginitis is a common cause of complaints in women in various parts of the world. Through our literature search, we identified noteworthy differences in the etiology of vaginitis based on the geographic location. This study was conducted to describe microbial etiology in a population of symptomatic women with vaginitis in Greece. MATERIAL/METHODS: Data for pathogens isolated from cultures of vaginal fluid specimens or identified with microscopy testing of such specimens of women with symptomatic vaginitis who were examined at "Lito" Private Obstetric/Gynecological Hospital, Athens, Greece, during the period 1/2003-12/2006 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: During this period, 1632 women were examined. The mean age of the patients was 28 years, ranging from 18 to 57 years. Three hundred and eighty five from 1632 cultures/tests contributed no pathogen, whereas 1247/1632 cultures/tests were positive. Of the isolates, in which twelve species were identified, 504 (40.4%) were Gardnerella vaginalis, 530 (42.5%) Candida spp, and 101 (8.1%) Trichomonas vaginalis. Less usual isolates were Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus spp., and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. CONCLUSIONS: The authors believe that this study adds to the relevant literature of information regarding the pathogens implicated in patients with symptomatic vaginitis by reporting data from a cohort of patients in Greece. Ninety-one percent of the isolated and identified pathogens from vaginal cultures of symptomatic Greek women included Candida albicans, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Trichomonas vaginalis, with the first two species representing the great majority.
TI  - Tongue biofilm areal density and tongue coating index.
AB  - Two methods have been employed to measure the amount of tongue biofilm in humans: (1) areal density of microbes (cfu cm(-2)) (tongue scrape from a known/measured area), or (2) a tongue-coating index, where a human judge assesses the amount of 'coating' by visual inspection. The two methods were compared, both on human volunteers and on artificial biofilms. Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Prevotella intermedia (Pi), Streptococcus mutans (Sm) and Peptostreptococcus micros (Pm) were obtained from stock cultures. Tongue scrape samples were obtained from four human volunteers in order to inoculate the in vitro matrices. A further 16 individuals (total n = 20) were co-measured for both visible tongue coating and quantitative biofilm (cfu cm(-2)). Tongue scrape suspensions were used to inoculate a cellulose matrix resting on a BHI-blood agar plate, periodically hydrated with sterile BHI and incubated for 10 days. Visual coating density images were recorded by camera. The relative light absorbance of standard suspensions of cells (pure species) was obtained by spectrophotometry across the visible spectrum. Biomatrix yields (log cfu cm(-2) +/- SD) for Fn, Pi, Sm and Pm were 7.07 (+/-0.04), 7.38 (+/-0.07), 7.25 (+/-0.10) and 7.41 (+/-0.011). Higher yields were obtained for tongue-scrape mixed cultures, ranging from 7.47 to 7.76. Biofilms (in vitro and in vivo) had different appearances when measured by human judges in terms of colour, pigmentation and opacity. There was no correlation (R(2) < 0.02) between the two methods. Biofilm matrices of similar population densities (ca approximately log 7.5) had widely different opacities depending on the species present.
TI  - SMAP29 congeners demonstrate activity against oral bacteria and reduced toxicity  against oral keratinocytes.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cathelicidins are antimicrobial peptides found in epithelial and mucosal tissues as well as the secondary granules of neutrophils. SMAP29, a sheep cathelicidin, has differential antimicrobial properties against various pathogens, including periodontal organisms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties and cytotoxicity of SMAP29, SMAP28, and three congeners (SMAP18A, SMAP18D, and SMAP14A). METHODS: The peptides at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 250 microg/ml were tested for their activity against multiple strains of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Porphyromonas gingivalis using a radial diffusion assay. Cytotoxicity of keratinocytes was evaluated by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release after incubation with the individual peptides. RESULTS: SMAP28, thought to be the biologically active peptide, was the most potent antimicrobial (range of minimum inhibitory concentrations 0.06-7.03 microg/ml, P < 0.05); however, the activity of SMAP28 and SMAP29 was strongly associated (r = 0.933). The congeners also demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the bacteria tested (range of minimum inhibitory concnetrations 0.21-79 microg/ml). Overall, F. nucleatum was the most susceptible organism, while P. gingivalis was the least susceptible. Keratinocyte cytotoxicity was dependent on peptide length and dose. SMAP28 was the most cytotoxic, while SMAP14A was the least cytotoxic. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial activities against oral microorganisms and the minimal toxicity seen in this study suggest that the congeners of SMAP29 may serve as an alternative to traditional antibiotics in the prevention and treatment of periodontal and other oral diseases.
TI  - Detection and identification of bacterial DNA in semen.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To detect and identify bacteria in semen by sequencing polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified ribosomal RNA gene regions (rDNAs). DESIGN: Bacterial rDNAs were detected by PCR amplification of semen DNA. Conditions were adjusted to detect only abundant organisms, no fewer than 20,000 bacteria/mL of semen. SETTING: Clinical andrology laboratory and academic research laboratories. PATIENT(S): Men undergoing fertility evaluation (n = 29) or vasectomy (n = 5). INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEAURE(S): Frequency of bacterial rDNA-positive specimens, relationship of rDNAs to bacteria in GenBank, and correlation with semen cells. RESULT(S): Twenty-five (56%) of the specimens from 22 (65%) of the men were positive. A total of 141 bacterial rDNA sequences were compared with GenBank data for identification. The largest group matched gram-positive anaerobic cocci (Peptoniphilis, Anaerococcus, Finegoldia, Peptostreptococcus spp.) in 13 specimens, followed by Corynebacterium spp. in 10 specimens, Staphylococcus, Lactobacillus, and Streptococcus spp. in 7 specimens each, Pseudomonas spp. in 4 specimens, and Haemophilus and Acinetobacter spp. in 2 specimens each. The rDNA-positive specimens averaged 59 +/- 13 million sperm/mL, 46 +/- 5% of which were motile, not statistically different from the rDNA-negative specimens (77 +/- 16 million/mL, 47 +/- 5% motile). Normal sperm forms were lower in the rDNA-positive (10 +/- 1.1%) than in the rDNA-negative specimens (22 +/- 2%), and lymphocytes/monocytes were fivefold lower in the rDNA-positive specimens (0.4 +/- 0.2 million/mL) than in the negative specimens (1.9 +/- 0.7 million/mL). CONCLUSION(S): Abundant bacteria in semen are not commensal, arise from infection in the male genitourinary tract, may influence fertility, and may reflect an inadequate cellular immune response.
TI  - Generation and expression of a minimal hybrid Ig-receptor formed between single domains from proteins L and G.
AB  - The Ig-binding properties of protein L from Peptostreptococcus magnus and protein G from Streptococcus have been successfully combined through the construction of a novel hybrid protein, consisting of a single Ig-binding domain from each protein. The biophysical and biochemical properties of this construct have been characterized through equilibrium and pre-equilibrium fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism, isothermal titration calorimetry, affinity chromatography, and conformational stability studies using a chemical denaturant in order to examine the structure and availability of ligand binding sites in each domain. These studies show that despite the small size of the protein (Mw=16.5 kDa) each domain behaves in an independent manner with respect to the binding characteristics of the same domain in isolation.
TI  - Cephalosporins in overcoming beta-lactamase-producing bacteria and preservation of the interfering bacteria in the treatment of otitis, sinusitis and tonsillitis.
AB  - The treatment of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) is complicated by the resurgence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (BLPB) and the absence of interfering bacteria. BLPB can have a direct pathogenic impact in causing the infection as well as an indirect impact through their ability to produce the enzyme beta-lactamase. BLPB may not only survive penicillin therapy but can also protect other penicillin-susceptible bacteria from penicillin. In this review, the clinical in vitro and in vivo evidence supporting the role of these organisms in the increased failure rate of penicillin in eradication of otitis, sinusitis and pharyngo-tonsillitis is outlined and the implication of that increased rate on the management of infections is discussed. Bacteria with interference capability of potential respiratory pathogens can prevent colonization and subsequent invasion by these organisms. These include alpha-hemolytic streptococci, nonhemolytic streptococci and Prevotella and Peptostreptococcus spp. Treatment with antimicrobials can affect the balance between the interfering organisms and potential pathogens. The role of bacterial interference in URTIs and its effect on their treatment is discussed. The use of some of the cephalosporins that are able to overcome the effect of BLPB and preserve the beneficial interfering bacteria can overcome and modulate these phenomena and achieve better cure of URTIs.
TI  - Bacterial examination of endodontic infections by clonal analysis in concert with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to examine the diversity of bacterial  species in the infected root canals of teeth associated with endodontic abscesses by cloning and sequencing techniques in concert with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. METHODS: Samples collected from five infected root canals were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with universal 16S ribosomal DNA primers. Products of these PCRs were cloned and sequenced. Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) was used as a screening method to reduce the number of clones necessary for DNA sequencing. RESULTS: All samples were positive for the presence of bacteria and a range of 7-13 different bacteria were found per root canal sample. In total, 48 different oral clones were detected among the five root canal samples. Olsenella profusa was the only species present in all samples. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Dialister pneumosintes, Dialister invisus, Lachnospiraceae oral clone, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Peptostreptococcus micros and Enterococcus faecalis were found in two of the five samples. The majority of the taxa were present in only one sample, for example Tannerella forsythia, Shuttleworthia satelles and Filifactor alocis. Some facultative anaerobes that are frequently isolated from endodontic infections such as E. faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus and Lactobacillus spp. were also found in this study. CONCLUSION: Clonal analysis of the microflora associated with endodontic infections revealed a wide diversity of oral species.
TI  - Evaluation of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections using checkerboard  DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in 111 selected cases of single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. METHODS: Samples were collected from the root canals using #15 Hedstroen-type files and two sterile paper points, which were introduced 1 mm short of the apical foramen. The presence, levels, and proportions of 40 different bacterial species in each sample were determined using DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization techniques. RESULTS: The mean number of species per sample was 22. Enterococcus faecalis (89.3%), Campylobacter gracilis (89.3%), Leptotrichia buccalis (89.3%), Neisseria mucosa (87.5%), Prevotella melaninogenica (86.6%), Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii (85.7%), Eubacterium saburreum (75.9%), Streptococcus anginosus (75%), and Veillonella parvula (74.1%) were the most prevalent species. The species found in highest mean counts (over 10(5)) were F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii (13.14 x 10(5)), E. saburreum (5.67 x 10(5)), E. faecalis (5.38 x 10(5)), N. mucosa (4.19 x 10(5)), V. parvula (3.63 x 10(5)), C. gracilis (3.46 x 10(5)), Treponema socranskii (3.34 x 10(5)), Porphyromonas endodontalis (2.96 x 10(5)), Porphyromonas gingivalis (2.85 x 10(5)), Micromonas micros (2.81 x 10(5)), Prevotella nigrescens (2.68 x 10(5)) and Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (2.64 x 10(5)). Most of these species were also found in high proportions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that several bacterial species considered to be oral pathogens seem to be implicated in the etiology of primary endodontic infections.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of DC-159a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - DC-159a is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that possesses a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, with extended activity against gram-positive pathogens, especially streptococci and staphylococci from patients with community-acquired infections. DC-159a showed activity against Streptococcus spp. (MIC(90), 0.12 microg/ml) and inhibited the growth of 90% of levofloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains at 1 microg/ml. The MIC 90s of DC-159a against Staphylococcus spp. were 0.5 microg/ml or less. Against quinolone- and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains, however, the MIC 90 of DC-159a was 8 microg/ml. DC-159a was the most active against Enterococcus spp. (MIC 90, 4 to 8 microg/ml) and was more active than the marketed fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. The MIC 90s of DC-159a against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.015, 0.06, and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. The activity of DC-159a against Mycoplasma pneumoniae was eightfold more potent than that of levofloxacin. The MICs of DC-159a against Chlamydophila pneumoniae were comparable to those of moxifloxacin, and DC-159a was more potent than levofloxacin. The MIC 90s of DC-159a against Peptostreptococcus spp., Clostridium difficile, and Bacteroides fragilis were 0.5, 4, and 2 microg/ml, respectively; and among the quinolones tested it showed the highest level of activity against anaerobic organisms. DC-159a demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against quinolone-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, DC-159a showed faster killing than moxifloxacin and garenoxacin. The bactericidal activity of DC-159a in a murine muscle infection model was revealed to be superior to that of moxifloxacin. These activities carried over to the in vivo efficacy in the murine pneumonia model, in which treatment with DC-159a led to bactericidal activity superior to those of the other agents tested.
TI  - Microbial flora in orodental infections.
AB  - The present study was carried out to compare the normal aerobic and anaerobic bacterial oral flora with flora from deep seated dental caries, gingivitis and adult periodontitis. All the samples belonging to both the control and study groups yielded microbes. Aerobe / Anaerobe ratio was high in normal flora (1.48) as compared to dental caries (0.9), gingivitis (0.72) and periodontitis (0.56). Ninety seven percent of orodental infections were polymicrobial and three or more microbes were found in 84% cases of study group as compared to 28% in controls. Streptococcus mutans and anaerobic lactobacilli were common in dental caries, Actinomyces and Peptostreptococcus spp. in gingivitis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis in periodontitis.
TI  - Production of antagonistic substance by Eikenella corrodens isolated from the oral cavity of human beings with and without periodontal disease.
AB  - AIMS: Antagonistic abilities may confer ecological advantages for micro-organisms in competitive ecosystems. However, reports regarding this phenomenon in Eikenella corrodens are not available. METHODS AND RESULTS: Nineteen E. corrodens strains, isolated from the oral cavity of human beings without periodontal disease (n = 5) and with aggressive (n = 9) and chronic (n = 5) periodontitis, as well as a reference strain (E. corrodens ATCC23834), were evaluated for antagonistic activity. The following indicators were used: Porphyromonas gingivalis FDC381, Prevotella intermedia ATCC25611, Actinomyces israelii ATCC12102, Eubacterium lentum ATCC25559, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius ATCC27337, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans FDCY4, Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC10953, Streptococcus sanguinis ATCC10557, Streptococcus uberis ATCC9927, Streptococcus mutans IM/UFRJ, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC33591 and Candida albicans ATCC18804. All the strains showed antagonism against at least one of the indicator strains. This phenomenon was more frequently observed for strains isolated from patients with chronic periodontitis (36.4%), than those from healthy subjects (20.6%) and those with aggressive periodontitis (10.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneous antagonistic spectrum exhibited by E. corrodens isolates suggests their ability to produce more than one antagonistic substance, whose ecological relevance is yet to be demonstrated. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first description of antagonistic compound production by E. corrodens and its relationships with the clinical status of the patients.
TI  - Microbiology of acute sinusitis of odontogenic origin presenting with periorbital cellulitis in children.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken to evaluate the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of acute maxillary sinusitis of odontogenic origin presenting with periodontal infection in children. METHODS: Aspirates of 18 acutely infected maxillary sinuses that were associated with odontogenic infection in children who presented with periorbital cellulitis were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: A total of 54 isolates were recovered (3.0 per specimen): 13 aerobic and facultative (0.7 per specimen) and 41 anaerobic (2.3 per specimen). The number of isolates per specimen varied from 1 to 4. Aerobic and facultative organisms alone were recovered in 2 specimens (11%), anaerobes only in 7 (39%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 9 (50%). The predominant aerobic and facultative organisms were alpha-hemolytic streptococci (4), microaerophilic streptococci (3), and Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus (2 each). The predominant anaerobic bacteria were anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (17), Peptostreptococcus spp (11), Fusobacterium spp (8), and Propionibacterium acnes (2). Twelve beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were recovered from 9 specimens (50%). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the unique aerobic and anaerobic microbiological features of acute maxillary sinusitis of odontogenic origin presenting with periorbital cellulitis in children.
TI  - Complicated parapneumonic effusion and empyema thoracis: microbiology and predictors of adverse outcomes.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the microbiological characteristics of a cohort of patients with complicated parapneumonic effusion and empyema thoracis, and to identify the potential risk factors for adverse outcomes, with particular reference to the choice of empirical antibiotics, intrapleural fibrinolytics, adherence to management guidelines, and input from pulmonologists. DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Regional hospital, Hong Kong. PATIENTS: All patients with a diagnosis of complicated parapneumonic effusion/empyema thoracis admitted between January 2003 and June 2005. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Microbiological characteristics, mortality, and surgery-free survival. RESULTS. There were 63 patients, with a mean age of 64 (standard deviation, 16) years and a male-to-female ratio of 45:18. The pleural fluid culture positivity rate was 68%; Streptococcus milleri (19%), Bacteroides (14%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12%), and Peptostreptococcus (7%) were the most common organisms. Thirteen (21%) patients died during their index admission. Use of intrapleural fibrinolytics according to the guideline was associated with survival (P=0.001) while discordant initial antibiotic use was associated with mortality (P=0.002). Discordant initial antibiotic use was also independently associated with reduced surgery-free survival (P<0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that early intrapleural fibrinolytic use (within 4 days of diagnosis) was associated with decreased mortality (P<0.001), increased surgery-free survival (P=0.005), and shorter hospital stay (P=0.039). CONCLUSION: Organisms identified from complicated parapneumonic effusion and empyema thoracis differ from those giving rise to community-acquired pneumonia. In these patients, adherence to guidelines, early concordant antibiotic treatment, intrapleural fibrinolytics, and input from a pulmonologist were associated with improved outcomes.
TI  - [Microbiocenosis of stomach in children with chronic gastritis].
AB  - Qualitative and quantitative composition of gastric microflora has been studied in 30 children with chronic gastritis. Bacteriological study of gastric biopsies and parietal mucus in 10 children with chronic gastritis not associated with Helicobacter pylori more frequently revealed conditionally pathogenic bacteria--Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, S. pyogenes (group A), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, P. prevotii and their associations. In 20 studied patients with H.pylori-associated chronic gastritis composition of local microflora was less diverse--conditionally pathogenic, lacto- and bifidobacteria often were absent. Study showed that eradication of H. pylori led to appearance of conditionally pathogenic bacteria in stomach microflora, which were frequently isolated in associations. Not effective treatment was associated with disappearance of lacto- and bifidobacteria and frequent isolation of Candida albicans.
TI  - Microorganisms in root carious lesions in adults.
AB  - PURPOSE: Root caries is emerging as a significant problem in the middle aged and  elderly subjects because of the improving general health conditions, and medical and technological advances. The purpose of this investigation was to assess the prevalence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria as well as yeasts of Candida genus in root carious lesions in middle-aged and older adults. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Specimens of root carious lesions were collected from 78 adults for bacteriological and mycological studies. Standard procedures of culture, isolation, and identification of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and fungi were used in the study. RESULTS: The analysis of results was performed independently in two age groups of adults, i.e. 52 subjects aged 35-44 years (middle age) and 26-aged 55-72 years (older age). There were 120 bacterial strains isolated from root carious lesions in middle-aged subjects, 63 (52.5%) strains belonged to 5 genera of aerobic bacteria and 57 (47.5%)--to 7 genera of anaerobic bacteria (p > 0.05). While in the second group, 85 strains were isolated, 54 (63.5%)--6 genera of aerobic bacteria and 31 (36.5%)--4 genera of anaerobic bacteria (p = 0.0004). There were no differences between the isolation rate of a various species in both examined groups, except for Streptococcus spp., S. oralis, Micrococcus spp., Neisseria spp. and Veillonella spp., which statistically significantly most frequent occurred in elderly (p < 0.05). The yeasts of Candida genus of 4 species (C. albicans, C. lusitaniae, C. pelliculosa, and C. pulcherrima) were isolated from middle-aged subjects (32.7%) with the comparable rate to older adults (30.8%; only C. albicans) (p > 0.05). Among all isolated microorganisms, Candida spp., were comprised about 10% in both examined groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic Gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp.) as well as anaerobic ones (Peptostreptococcus spp.), and Candida albicans were occurred most frequently in root carious lesions in middle-aged and older adults.
TI  - Bacterial composition in the supragingival plaques of children with and without dental caries.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of the present investigation was to determine if the supragingival bacterial composition plaques in children with caries would differ from those found in caries-free controls. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Pooled supragingival plaque samples from the smooth surfaces of teeth were collected from 75 children with caries and 131 children without caries. The plaque samples were analysed for bacterial content by cultures on a series of non-selective and selective media for aerobic, microaerophilic and anaerobic bacteria. Additionally, the specimens of dentine carious lesions were examined. The standard culture procedures and identifications of bacteria were used. RESULTS: Among 131 children without dental caries, 41 (31.3%) were at preschool age with deciduous teeth and 90 (68.7%) at school age with permanent teeth. Dental plaques of caries-free children revealed 452 strains, out of which 326 (72.1%) were from permanent teeth, 126 (27.9%)--from deciduous teeth (p = 0.0001). Among 75 children with dental caries, 61 (81.3%) were at preschool age and 14 (18.7%)--at school age. There were 239 strains isolated from supragingival plaques in children with dental caries, 187 (78.2%) --in preschool children, and 52 (21.8%)--in school children (p < 0.05). From dentine carious lesions in these children, 209 strains were isolated; 164 from preschool children and 45--from school children (p < 0.05). Gram-positive bacteria were isolated more frequently than Gram-negative ones (p = 0.0001) from supragingival plaques both in children with and without dental caries. Streptococcus genus bacteria were isolated more often (p = 0.0002) from the plaques in school children without dental caries. The proportion (%) of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was comparable (p > 0.05) in dental plaques in children with and without dental caries, except for Veillonella spp., which were isolated more frequently from dental plaques in school children with dental caries (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: 1) Generally, there was no statistically significant difference of bacterial species composition isolated from supragingival plaques in children with deciduous and permanent dental caries and caries-free children. 2) There was no difference between bacterial composition in dentine carious lesions of deciduous teeth and permanent teeth as compared to supragingival plaques in these children (except for Neisseria spp., Peptostreptococcus spp.).
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in subgingival and supragingival plaques of adult  patients with periodontal disease.
AB  - PURPOSE: Clinical, epidemiological and microbiological examinations of adult patients with periodontal disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study of population consisted of 21 subjects (13 female and 8 male) aged 38-58 years, treated in the Outpatient Department of Periodontology. Dental examinations were performed at an artificial light and using a WHO periodontometer, a mirror and a probe. Periodontal status was assessed by determination of the probing pocket depth (CPI), gingival state (GSBI according to Muhlemann and Son), and oral hygiene index (according to Silness and Loe). Material for microbiological examination was collected from subgingival and supragingival plaques of each patient. Additionally, pus was obtained from 8 patients and periodontal pocket fluid from 2 patients. The samples were examined for the presence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and Candida yeasts. Standard procedures were used for culture and identification of bacteria and fungi. RESULTS: Candida yeasts were not isolated from adults with periodontal disease. In 19/21 patients, cultures of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from subgingival and supragingival plaque samples were positive. A total of 42 bacterial strains were isolated from subgingival plaques, of which 24 (57.1%) belonged to 7 anaerobic species and 18 (42.9%) to 12 aerobic species (p > 0.05). There were more aerobic (33/53; 62.3%) than anaerobic bacteria (20/53; 37.7%) (p < 0.05) in supragingival plaques. Anaerobes were isolated more frequently than aerobes from the abscess (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: 1) In adult patients with periodontal disease, Gram-positive anaerobes, including Peptostreptococcus, were the predominant bacteria in the subgingival plaque. 2) While in the supragingival plaque, Gram-positive aerobic cocci (Streptococcus and Staphylococcus) were predominant.
TI  - Sirolimus-associated chronic pyogenic periungual infection.
AB  
TI  - Effect of smoking cessation on the microbial flora.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of smoking cessation on the frequency of recovery of potential pathogens and aerobic and anaerobic interfering bacteria in the nasopharynges of smokers. DESIGN: Nasopharyngeal cultures were taken from 20 smokers before and 12 to 15 months after cessation of smoking. Potential pathogens and aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with interfering capabilities against these organisms were identified. RESULTS: Eleven potential pathogens (0.92 pathogens per subject) were isolated from nasopharyngeal cultures obtained from 9 individuals before smoking cessation, and 2 (0.17 per subject) were recovered from 2 individuals after smoking cessation (P < .05). Bacterial interference between 2 aerobic (alpha and nonhemolytic streptococci) and 2 anaerobic species (Prevotella and Peptostreptococcus species) and 4 potential pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes) was observed. Bacterial interference was noted in 35 instances against the 4 potential pathogens by 14 normal flora isolates that were recovered from the smokers before cessation and in 116 instances by 42 isolates after cessation (P < .01). CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, these findings illustrate for the first time that the high number of pathogens and low number of interfering organisms found in the nasopharynx of smokers revert to normal levels after complete cessation of smoking.
TI  - Evaluation of subgingival bacteria in the dog and susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics.
AB  - The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the subgingival aerobic and  anaerobic flora of 13 dogs with periodontal disease and the susceptibility of these bacteria to antibiotics currently approved in Italy for treatment of canine infections. Of the anaerobic bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis was most frequently isolated, followed by Peptostreptococcus + Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia. Of the aerobic bacteria, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus was most frequently isolated, often associated with Escherichia coli or Pasteurella multocida. Resistance of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria to various antibiotics was generally high. Anaerobic bacteria appeared to be susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, doxycycline, and erythromycin; aerobic bacteria appeared to be susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, erythromycin, gentamycin, and sulfa-trimethoprim. Bacteroides fragilis was resistant to all of the antibiotics tested. The emerging worldwide problem of bacterial resistance to antibiotics resulting from overuse and misuse of antibiotics is discussed.
TI  - Human serum activity of telithromycin, azithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate against common aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens.
AB  - Telithromycin is a new ketolide antimicrobial with a good in vitro activity against both aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens. In this study, we evaluated the antibacterial activity over time of telithromycin (800mg), azithromycin (500mg), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (875/125mg) in serum following single oral doses of these agents to 10 healthy subjects. Inhibitory and bactericidal titers were determined at 2, 6, 12, and 24h after each dose and the median titer was used to determine antibacterial activity. Against two azithromycin-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, both telithromycin (MIC=0.25 and 0.5 microg/mL) and amoxicillin/clavulanate exhibited inhibitory and cidal activity for at least 6h. All three antibiotics provided prolonged (>or=12h) inhibitory activity against strains of Hemophilus influenzae (telithromycin MIC=4.0 microg/ml). Both telithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate exhibited rapid and prolonged inhibitory activity (>or=12h) against each of the anaerobes studied (Finegoldia [Peptostreptococcus] magna Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella bivia, and Prevotella melaninogenica). Moreover, both agents provided bactericidal activity against both Prevotella species. In this ex vivo pharmacodynamic study, we found that telithromycin provided rapid and prolonged antibacterial activity in serum against macrolide-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains of H. influenzae, and common respiratory anaerobic pathogens. These findings suggest that telithromycin could have clinical utility in the treatment of community-acquired mixed aerobic-anaerobic respiratory tract infections, including chronic sinusitis and aspiration pneumonia.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal species in symptomatic and asymptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  - Phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA was used to examine polymicrobial communities within infected root canals of 20 symptomatic and 14 asymptomatic patients. Nucleotide sequences from approximately 750 clones amplified from each patient group with universal bacterial primers were matched to the Ribosomal Database Project II database. Phylotypes from 37 genera representing Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria were identified. Results were compared to those obtained with species-specific primers designed to detect Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Peptostreptococcus micros, Enterococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Tannerella forsythensis and Treponema denticola. Since members of the domain Archaea have been implicated in the severity of periodontal disease, and a recent report confirms that archaea are present in endodontic infections, 16S archaeal primers were also used to detect which patients carried these prokaryotes, to determine if their presence correlated with severity of the clinical symptoms. A Methanobrevibacter oralis-like species was detected in one asymptomatic and one symptomatic patient. DNA from root canals of these two patients was further analysed using species-specific primers to determine bacterial cohabitants. Trep. denticola was detected in the asymptomatic but not the symptomatic patient. Conversely, Porph. endodontalis was found in the symptomatic but not the asymptomatic patient. All other species except enterococci were detected with the species-specific primers in both patients. These results confirm the presence of archaea in root canals and provide additional insights into the polymicrobial communities in endodontic infections associated with clinical symptoms.
TI  - Identification of bacteria associated with spreading odontogenic infections by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the bacterial species associated with spreading odontogenic infections (SOIs). STUDY DESIGN: Pus samples from 4 cases of SOI were analyzed by microbiological culture methods for the presence of bacteria, and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, cloning, and sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes. RESULTS: Culture methods identified species from the genera Prevotella, Streptococcus, and Fusobacterium, as well as anaerobic streptococci. Molecular detection methods identified a far more diverse microflora. The predominant genus detected was Prevotella, representing 102 (50.2%) of 203 clones analyzed. Prevotella oris was the most abundant species identified, representing 45 (22.2%) of 203 clones analyzed. Twelve clones (5.9%) represented uncultivable species, namely Prevotella PUS9.180, an uncultured Peptostreptococcus species, and an uncultured bacterium belonging to the Bacteroidetes phylum. CONCLUSIONS: Prevotella species may play an important role in SOIs, and further work to examine in more detail the pathogenicity determinants of these organisms and associated host responses is warranted.

TI  - [Characteristics of war wound infection].
AB  - War wounds are the most complex type of non-targeted injuries due to uncontrolled tissue damage of varied and multifold localizations, exposing sterile body areas to contamination with a huge amount of bacteria. Wound contamination is caused by both the host microflora and exogenous agents from the environment (bullets, cloth fragments, dust, dirt, water) due to destruction of the host protective barriers. War wounds are the consequence of destructive effects of various types of projectiles, which result in massive tissue devitalization, hematomas, and compromised circulation with tissue ischemia or anoxia. This environment is highly favorable for proliferation of bacteria and their invasion in the surrounding tissue over a relatively short period of time. War wounds are associated with a high risk of local and systemic infection. The infection will develop unless a timely combined treatment is undertaken, including surgical intervention within 6 hours of wounding and antibiotic therapy administered immediately or at latest in 3 hours of wound infliction. Time is a crucial factor in this type of targeted combined treatment consisting of surgical debridement, appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy, and specific antitetanic prophylaxis. Apart from exposure factors, there are a number of predisposing factors that favor the development of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infection. These are shock, pain, blood loss, hypoxia, hematomas, type and amount of traumatized tissue, age, and comorbidity factors in the wounded. The determinants that define the spectrum of etiologic agents in contaminated war wounds are: wound type, body region involved, time interval between wounding and primary surgical treatment, climate factors, season, geographical area, hygienic conditions, and patient habits. The etiologic agents of infection include gram-positive aerobic cocci, i. e. Staphylococcus spp, Streptococcus spp and Enterococcus spp, which belong to the physiological flora of the human skin and mucosa; gram-negative facultative aerobic rods; members of the family Enterobacteriacea (Escherichia coil, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae), which predominate in the physiological flora of the intestines, transitory flora of the skin and environment; gram-negative bacteria, i. e. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus - A. baumanii complex; environmental bacteria associated with humid environment and dust; anaerobic gram-positive sporogeneous rods Clostridium spp, gram-negative asporogeneous rods Bacteroides spp and gram-positive anaerobic cocci; Peptostreptococcus spp and Peptococcus spp. The latter usually colonize the intestine, primarily the colon, and the skin, while clostridium spores are also found in the environment. Early empirical antibiotic therapy is used instead of standard antibiotic prophylaxis. Empirical antimicrobial therapy is administered to prevent the development of systemic infection, gas gangrene, necrotizing infection of soft tissue, intoxication and death. The choice of antibiotics is determined by the presumed infective agents and localization of the wound. It is used in all types of war wounds over 5-7-10 days. The characteristics of antibiotics used in war wounds are the following: broad spectrum of activity, ability to penetrate deep into the tissue, low toxicity, long half-life, easy storage and application, and cost effectiveness. The use of antibiotics is not a substitution for surgical treatment. The expected incidence of infection, according to literature data, is 35%-40%. If the time elapsed until surgical debridement exceeds 12 hours, or the administration of antibiotics exceeds 6 hours of wound infliction, primary infection of the war wound occurs (early infection) in more than 50% of cases. The keys for the prevention of infection are prompt and thorough surgical exploration of the wound, administration of antibiotics and antitetanic prophylaxis, awareness of the probable pathogens with respect to localization of the wound, and optimal choice of antibiotics and length of their administration.
TI  - Bacteriology of chronic sinusitis and acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish the microbiological characteristics of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis (AECS). SETTING: Academic medical center. PATIENTS: Thirty-two patients with chronic sinusitis and 30 patients with AECS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of maxillary AECS and chronic maxillary sinusitis. RESULTS: A total of 81 isolates (33 aerobic and 48 anaerobic) were recovered from the 32 cases (2.5 per specimen) with chronic sinusitis. Aerobes alone were recovered in 8 specimens (25%), anaerobes only were isolated in 11 (34%), and mixed aerobes and anaerobes were recovered in 13 (41%). The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus aureus. The predominant anaerobic bacteria were Peptostreptococcus subspecies, Fusobacterium subspecies, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, and Propionibacterium acnes. Twenty-one beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were recovered from 17 specimens (53%). A total of 89 isolates (40 aerobic and facultatives, and 49 anaerobic) were recovered from the 30 patients (3.0 per specimen) with AECS. Aerobes were recovered in 8 instances (27%), anaerobes only in 11 (37%), and mixed aerobes and anaerobes were recovered in 11 (37%). The predominant aerobes were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacteriaceae, and S aureus. The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus subspecies, Fusobacterium subspecies, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, and P acnes. Thirty-six beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were recovered from 28 specimens (53%). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the organisms isolated from patients with AECS were predominantly anaerobic and were similar to those generally recovered in patients with chronic sinusitis. However, aerobic bacteria that are usually found in acute infections (eg, S pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis) can also emerge in some of the episodes of AECS.
TI  - Root canal microbiota of dogs' teeth with periapical lesions induced by two different methods.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The microbial composition was investigated in root canals of dogs' teeth with periapical lesions induced by 2 different methods: open versus sealed canals. STUDY DESIGN: Teeth from Group I (n = 16) were left open for a week, then sealed with composite resin for 120 days. The teeth from Group II (n = 16) were left open for the same period. Microbiological samples from the root canals were collected and processed by the anaerobic technique for identification and counting of microorganisms after establishment of periapical reactions. RESULTS: Seventy-four cultivable isolates were recovered in sealed canals (Group I). Strict anaerobes accounted for 64.9% of all species isolated, and gram-negative microorganisms accounted for 55.4%. Microbial genera most frequently isolated were Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Clostridium, and Porphyromonas. Statistical analysis by Pearson chi-square or Fisher's test revealed positive association between sealed teeth and strict anaerobes (P < .05). In open canals (Group II), from a total of 58 cultivable isolates, 19% were strict anaerobes and 81% facultative anaerobes, with predominance of gram-positive species (75.8%). Genera most frequently isolated were Streptococcus, Propionibacterium, Staphylococcus, Neisseria, and Prevotella. CONCLUSION: Strict anaerobes were most frequently found in sealed teeth rather than in the teeth with canals left exposed to the oral cavity for 4 months. Therefore, the method that induced periapical inflammatory lesions by intentional oral exposure, followed by tooth sealing, produced root canal microbiota similar to the same found in humans.
TI  - Coaggregation interactions between oral and endodontic Enterococcus faecalis and  bacterial species isolated from persistent apical periodontitis.
AB  - Interactions between Enterococcus faecalis and other species found in root canal  infections might be important for the development and persistence of periapical disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the coaggregation interactions between E. faecalis clinical isolates and species previously shown to survive and induce apical periodontitis in monkeys: Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella oralis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Streptococcus anginosus. Intergeneric coaggregation assays were conducted in duplicate with observations scored immediately at 0 h, 1 h and 24 h after mixing of combinations of strains. All E. faecalis strains (n = 53) coaggregated with F. nucleatum; E. faecalis did not coaggregate with P. anaerobius or S. anginosus. One strain, E. faecalis E1, coaggregated with P. oralis, with aggregates visible at 1 h. Coaggregation interactions between E. faecalis and F. nucleatum observed in this study suggest a potential role for this combination in endodontic infections.
TI  - [A case of multiple lung abscesses successfully treated with computed tomography  guided percutaneous thoracic drainage].
AB  - A 48-year-old woman who had abused alcohol admitted to our hospital because of fever and chest pain. Laboratory data presented inflammation and liver dysfunction. Chest X-ray films revealed multiple mass lesions with air fluid levels. We diagnosed multiple lung abscesses and started treatment with antibiotics. However, her fever did not improve and mass lesions increased. On day 6 of hospitalization, three drainage tubes were inserted percutaneously into the mass lesions under computed tomography (CT) guidance, and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, peptostreptococcus sp. and neutrophils were isolated from the drainage fluid. Abcesses and inflammation were improved by administration of the antibiotics selected according to the result of fluid culture. Because all multiple abcesses were located near the pleura, we successfully treated them with simultaneous percutaneus thoracic drainage.
TI  - Microbiology of peritonsillar abscesses.
AB  - AIM: The objective of the present study was to analyze the microbiology of peritonsillar abscesses. METHODS: Thirty patients, mean age 24,2 years, with peritonsillar abscesses underwent aspiration of at least 3 mL of pus, which was cultured for aerobes and anaerobes. RESULTS: 87% samples showed positive cultures. Aerobic or facultative aerobic bacteria were isolated from 23% aspirates, mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 60%, and anaerobic bacteria from only 3% aspirate. A total of 69 bacterial isolates (34 aerobic and 35 anaerobic) were recovered. The most common aerobic isolate was Streptococcus sp, with Streptococcus pyogenes being identified in 23% of aspirates. The predominant anaerobic isolates were Prevotella sp and Peptostreptococcus sp. Patients had received previous antimicrobial therapy in 63% cases. In this group, 1.8 isolates per specimen were recovered, a lower number than in the untreated group (3.0 per specimen). No significant difference in the species isolated was observed between these two groups. CONCLUSION: Peritonsillar abscess is usually a polymicrobial infection, with predominance of anaerobic bacteria. The number of agents isolated was larger in patients not previously treated with antibiotics, but the use of antimicrobial drugs did not interfere with the type of bacterium isolated.
TI  - Influence of residual bacteria on periapical tissue healing after chemomechanical treatment and root filling of experimentally infected monkey teeth.
AB  - The purpose of this study was twofold: first, to determine the influence on the healing of the periapical tissues when selected bacterial strains and combinations thereof remain after root canal treatment; and, second, the relationship to healing of the quality of the root filling. In eight monkeys, 175 root canals, previously infected with combinations of four or five bacterial strains and with radiographically verified apical periodontitis, were endodontically treated, bacteriologically controlled, and permanently obturated. After 2-2.5 yr, the periapical regions were radiographically and histologically examined. Of these teeth, 48 root canals were also examined for bacteria remaining after removal of the root fillings. When bacteria remained after the endodontic treatment, 79% of the root canals showed non-healed periapical lesions, compared with 28% where no bacteria were found. Combinations of residual bacterial species were more frequently related to non-healed lesions than were single strains. When no bacteria remained, healing occurred independently of the quality of the root filling. In contrast, when bacteria remained, there was a greater correlation with non-healing in poor-quality root fillings than in technically well-performed fillings. In root canals where bacteria were found after removal of the root filling, 97% had not healed, compared with 18% for those root canals with no bacteria detected. The present study demonstrates the importance of obtaining a bacteria-free root canal system before permanent root filling in order to achieve optimal healing conditions for the periapical tissues.
TI  - An in vitro time-kill assessment of linezolid and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Linezolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), enterococci (including vancomycin-resistant strains), streptococci (including penicillin-intermediate and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae), and other aerobic and facultative bacteria. The agent has also demonstrated activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. Previous time-kill assessments have shown linezolid to be generally bacteriostatic against staphylococci and enterococci, and bactericidal against streptococci. In this study, an anaerobic glovebox technique was employed to conduct time-kill assessments for four strains of anaerobic Gram-positive, and seven strains of anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. The time-kill experiment was performed using Anaerobe Broth medium. The drugs were tested at four-fold the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), or at the higher concentration of 8mg/L for linezolid, 2mg/L for clindamycin, and 8mg/L for metronidazole. Samples for viable count were taken at 0, 6, and 24h, and plated using the Bioscience International Autospiral DW. Exposure of samples to the aerobic environment during plating was held to less than 30min. Plates were counted after a 48h anaerobic incubation (37 degrees C). The species tested included Bacteroides fragilis (2), B. distasonis, B. thetaiotaomicron, Fusobacterium nucleatum, F. varium, Prevotella melaninogenica, Clostridium perfringens, Eubacterium lentum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (2). The activity of linezolid was compared to that of metronidazole and clindamycin, two standard anti-anaerobe agents. As expected, the control agents were very active in these assays. Metronidazole yielded log(10)CFU/mL reductions of 3.0 or greater for nine of ten strains; clindamycin yielded log(10)CFU/mL reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for three strains. Linezolid also produced significant in vitro killing in this model achieving log(10)CFU/mL reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for four strains. The profile of activity was similar to that of clindamycin indicating that additional developmental studies of linezolid with anaerobic bacteria are warranted.
TI  - Evaluation of 4 swab transport systems for the recovery of ATCC and clinical strains with characterized resistance mechanisms.
AB  - Despite limitations of swab transport systems (STS), many clinical samples and bacterial isolates are sent on these devices. We evaluated the performance of 4 commercial STS: M40 Transystem (S1, Copan Italia, Bovezzo, Italy), UNI-TER (S2, MEUS, Piove di Sacco, Italy), Euromed (S3, LAB SERVICE, Surbo, Italy), and Eurotubo (S4, Deltalab, Rubi, Spain). Survival of ATCC and clinical strains with characterized resistance mechanisms, stored at room temperature and using the roll-plate method (NCCLS M40-A) after holding times of 0, 6, 24, 48, and 72 h, and 7 days, was assessed. After 24 h, only S1 was able to maintain Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 6305), Haemophilus influenzae (10211), and Neisseria meningitidis (13090) viability with a percentage range of recovery with respect to the baseline count at zero time of 104-184%. Neisseria gonorrhoeae (43069) was uncultivable after 6 h with all STS except S1 (46% recovery). Eighteen percent recovery after 24 h and 7% after 6 h was observed for Fusobacterium nucleatum (25586) and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (27337), respectively, but only with S1. Resistance mechanisms in clinical isolates do not affect survival with any of the STS.
TI  - Bacteriological findings and antimicrobial susceptibility in chronic sinusitis with nasal polyp.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: We recommend amoxacillin/clavulanate, cephalosporins and macrolides  rather than penicillin as the first-line drug in chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps. In cases where there is no improvement of symptoms, cultures should be taken from the middle meatus, followed by appropriate selection of second-line antibiotics according to the sensitivity test results. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the causative bacteria and the antimicrobial susceptibility in patients with chronic sinusitis and nasal polyps in Korea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The bacteriology and antimicrobial susceptibility of maxillary sinus aspirates from 81 patients were evaluated. RESULTS: Aerobes were isolated from 58.0% of the cultures from the middle meatus and from 48.1% of those from the maxillary sinus. Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the most prevalent aerobic pathogens. Anaerobes were isolated from 8.6% of the cultures from the middle meatus and from 18.5% of the cultures from the maxillary sinus. The predominant anaerobic organisms were Prevotella and Peptostreptococcus in adults but none of them were cultured in children. A high rate of concordance of the middle meatus and maxillary sinus was noted. Monomicrobial infection was most commonly observed. Ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae isolates were cultured in 46% of the cases. Penicillin resistance rates were 93% for Staph. aureus; 25% of Strep. pneumoniae were intermediate and 25% were resistant.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial efficacy of a new chlorhexidine slow-release device.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial effect of chlorhexidine and calcium hydroxide slow-release devices on oral bacteria. METHOD AND MATERIALS: The agar diffusion test was used to evaluate the antibacterial effect of the slow-release devices Activ Point (chlorhexidine; Roeko) and Calcium Hydroxide Plus Point (Roeko) on 8 anaerobic and 2 facultative oral bacterial strains, as well as 2 bacterial cultures randomly sampled from necrotic root canals and incubated in anaerobic and aerobic broth for 48 hours. The efficiency of the medicaments against the various strains was evaluated using a nonparametric test (Friedman type) and a second nonparametric test (Wilcoxon's signed rank test). RESULTS: Activ Point produced significantly larger inhibition zones (P < .001) than the calcium hydroxide slow-release device around all tested bacterial strains. CONCLUSION: The chlorhexidine slow-release device (Activ Point) exhibited significant antibacterial activity in the agar diffusion test and merits study as an intracanal medicament.
TI  - Factors affecting the bacteriology of deep neck infection: a retrospective study  of 128 patients.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Broad-spectrum antibiotics are advocated for treating deep neck infection. Anaerobic coverage is necessary, especially in odontogenic cases. The presence of diabetes, infection of the parotid space and an obvious odontogenic source of infection can aid in determining the causative organisms. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to analyze the bacteriology in deep neck infections and identify the factors that influenced the causative pathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The records of 212 patients who were diagnosed as having deep neck infections at the National Taiwan University Hospital between 1997 and 2003 were reviewed; 128 patients with bacterial isolation from their pus cultures were enrolled. RESULTS: The cultures of 46 patients (35.9%) were polymicrobial. Viridans Streptococcus was the most commonly isolated organism (38.3%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (32.0%) and Peptostreptococcus (17.2%). The most common organism in 44 diabetic patients was K. pneumoniae (54.5%), versus viridans streptococcus (48.8%) in 84 nondiabetic patients. In patients with dental sources of infections, the culture rate of anaerobes was 59.3%; in upper airway infections and other sources of infections they were 22.7% and 21.5%, respectively (Chi(2) test, p = 0.0008). The differences in age, sex, and climate did not show any significant changes in the common causative pathogens. Common pathogens in the infection of parapharyngeal, submandibular, and extended spaces were the same as viridans streptococcus, but in the parotid space K. pneumoniae was the most common pathogen.
TI  - [Tracking of the development of fecal bacterial community of diarrhea piglets by  16S rDNA techniques].
AB  - PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) were used to track the development of fecal bacterial community of 5 diarrhea piglets. Clone libraries were created from complete 16S rDNA of 42-day fecal sample of piglet 1, 2 and 5. From the library, clones had their V6-V8 regions matched predominant bands on the DGGE gel were then sequenced and their 16S rDNAs subjected to an online similarity search. Results revealed that DGGE profiles from fecal samples of 5 piglets changed form simple to complex, and then returned simple to complex, finally tended to be stable and diverse. DGGE profiles from day 2and 16 fecal samples of 5 piglets were simplest, with high similarity (84%). Their most predominant bands were E. coil. Their Shannon index were 1.38 +/- 0.55 and 1.97 +/- 0.26 respectively. DGGE profiles from day 10 of 5 piglets became quite complex, and had quite low similarity (10%) with DGGE profiles from day 2and 16 fecal samples of 5 piglets. The Shannon index was 2.12 +/- 0.24. E. coil still existed, but it was not the most predominant band. There were significant differences of predominant bands between DGGE profiles from day 27 fecal samples and those from day 35 and 42 fecal samples, with 26.28% and 39.2% of similarity respectively. The predominant bands from day 35 and 42 fecal samples of 5 piglets were tended to be stable, with 55% of similarity. The Shannon index of day 27, day 35 and 42 fecal bacterial communities were 2.19 +/- 0.29, 2.20 +/- 0.17 and 2.14 +/- 0.20 respectively. The fecal bacterial communities of day 42 health piglets were mainly consisted of species of Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus and Lactobacillus.
TI  - Is pre-term labour associated with periodontitis in a Danish maternity ward?
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To reveal differences in periodontal status and presence of subgingival bacteria in a Scandinavian population of women with pre-term birth compared with women who delivered at term. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one women with pre-term labour (before week 35) and 33 women with term labour (between weeks 38 and 41) were included in this case-control study. Periodontal measurements included plaque index (PlI), probing pocket depth (PPD) and bleeding on probing (BOP). Inter-proximal distances from the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ) to the marginal bone crest (MBC) were measured on bitewing radiographs. In 31 patients (16 cases and 15 controls) the subgingival plaque was analysed using "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: Differences between the two examined groups were found related to "Twin births" (p=0.0064) and "Smokers" (p=0.03). None of the periodontal measurements showed any association. Significant differences were found concerning presence of Tannerella forsythensis, Treponema denticola, Peptostreptococcus micros, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis and Capnocytophaga ochracea but when defining sites with >10(5) bacteria as heavily colonized, no statistical difference was found between the two groups. CONCLUSION: A relation between pre-term birth and periodontitis was not revealed in the present study.
TI  - Microbiology of intracranial abscesses and their associated sinusitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the organisms recovered from infected sinuses and associated intracranial abscesses (IAs). DESIGN: Retrospective review of findings from aspirate of pus from 10 infected sinuses and their corresponding IAs. SETTING: Academic medical center. PATIENTS: Ten patients diagnosed as having sinusitis (age range, 7-58 years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria findings from infected sinuses and IAs. RESULTS: Polymicrobial flora was found in 9 sinuses and 8 IAs. Anaerobes were isolated from all sinuses and 9 IAs. A total of 26 isolates (2.6 isolates per specimen) were recovered from the sinuses: 19 anaerobic, 6 aerobic or facultative, and 1 microaerophilic; 17 isolates were found in the IAs (1.7 isolates per site): 13 anaerobic, 2 aerobic or facultative, and 2 microaerophilic. The predominant anaerobes were Fusobacterium species (in 5 corresponding sinuses and abscesses, 1 in a sinus only, and 1 in an IA only), Prevotella species (in 3 corresponding sinuses and abscesses), Peptostreptococcus species (in 2 corresponding sinuses and abscesses, and 4 in a sinus only), Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae type b, microaerophilic streptococci, and Bacteroides ureolyticus (in 1 corresponding sinus and abscess each). Streptococcus pneumoniae was recovered 2 times, only from a sinus. Alpha-hemolytic streptococci and beta-hemolytic streptococci group F were each isolated once from the sinus. Concordance in the microbiological findings between the sinus and the IA was found in all instances. However, certain organisms were present at only one or the other site. CONCLUSION: These data illustrate the concordance in the recovery of organisms from infected sinuses and their associated IA and confirm the importance of anaerobic bacteria in sinusitis and IA.
TI  - [Two cases of Bartholin's gland abscesses caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and  Haemophilus influenzae].
AB  - Most of Bartholin's gland abscesses have been thought to be caused by microorganisms found in opportunistic infections. However, we have encountered two very interesting cases of Bartholin's gland abscesses caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, two major pathogens of respiratory tract infections. In the first case, since abscess formation was not observed due to disintegration, cefdinir (CFDN), 300 mg/day, t.i.d. for 5 days was administered. The treatment improved clinical symptoms, but relapse occurred 3 days after the administration was discontinued. Microbiological examination of pus revealed the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Finegoldia magna, and it also showed that the isolated S. pneumoniae was penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP). After an incision and drainage of abscess, cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI), 300 mg/day t.i.d. for 7 days, was administered, and the cure was confirmed. In the second case, after an incision and drainage of Bartholin's gland abscess, amoxicillin (AMPC), 750 mg/day, t.i.d. for 5 days, was administered. The treatment improved clinical symptoms temporarily. However, the symptoms deteriorated 7 days after the operation, and the patient was diagnosed with relapse. Microbiological examination of pus revealed the presence of Haemophilus influenzae and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and it also showed that the isolated H. influenzae was beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae (BLNAR). After performing additional incision and drainage of abscess again, CFTM-PI, 300 mg/day, t.i.d. for 7 days, was administered, and the cure was confirmed. In addition, the analysis of these two cases using PK/PD theory revealed that the time above MIC reached 100% with administration of CFTM-PI 300mg, t.i.d. suggesting that the dosage is sufficient for treating these infections. There are other cases of external genitalia infections caused by microorganisms usually associated with respiratory tract infections like cases that we are reporting here. Therefore, it is necessary to consider a possible infection by drug-resistant bacteria even for a case of external genitalia infection. In addition, it was thought that adjusting dosage and method for administration of antibacterial agents based on PK/PD theory would help to rovide efficient treatment.
TI  - [Bacterial spectra and antibiotics in odontogenic infections. Renaissance of the  penicillins?].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role played by odontogenic infection in dental, oral, and maxillofacial surgery is not to be underestimated even at the present time. An extensive, standardized, prospective study was performed with the intention of verifying the bacterial spectrum of odontogenic infections to evaluate antibiotic sensitivity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bacterial spectra and resistograms of 65 patients with an odontogenic infection were analyzed in a prospective study under standardized conditions for specimen collection and transport. RESULTS: A total of 226 bacterial strains were analyzed. The ratio between anaerobes and aerobes was approximately 2:1. The most frequent aerobes were members of the genera Streptococcus (46 isolates), Staphylococcus (10 isolates), and Neisseria (9 isolates), respectively. The anaerobic gram-positive spectrum was dominated by members of the genera Eubacterium (19 isolates), Peptostreptococcus (16 isolates), and Actinomyces (12 isolates). The most frequently isolated gram-negative anaerobes were Prevotella (46 isolates), and Fusobacterium (21 isolates). The overall resistance to antibiotics was very low: only 7.3% of all bacteria were resistant to penicillin G/V, and 8.8% showed resistance to ampicillin. The resistance rates to other beta-lactam antibiotics were 4.4% to piperacillin and 0.6% to imipenem, respectively. Penicillin G presented the highest antimicrobial activity among aerobes: only 4.5% of anaerobic strains were resistant of penicillin G. The other resistance rates of anaerobic bacteria to antibiotics were as follows: ampicillin 24%, doxycycline 34%, erythromycin 18%, and clindamycin 9.3%. Penicillin G was also highly antimicrobially active to anaerobes. The resistance rates were: penicillin G 8.1%, ampicillin 2.6%, doxycycline 9.2%, erythromycin 10.2%, and clindamycin 1.4%, respectively.
TI  - Microbial analysis of the autogenous bone collected by bone filter during oral surgery: a clinical study.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purposes of the study presented are to identify the microbial content of the collected bone debris and to determine the antibacterial efficiency of chlorhexidine mouth rinse in reducing the microbial content of the collected bone debris. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients who had asymptomatic fully impacted mandibular third molars bilaterally underwent surgical removal for prophylactic and orthodontic considerations. Immediately before surgery all patients rinsed with 10 mL of their assigned solution (chlorhexidine or sterile saline) for 2 minutes. Before surgical removal of the teeth, bone debris was collected with a stringent aspiration protocol from the ramus by bone filter. The microbial content of the bone debris was assessed and the bacterial levels between the 2 groups were compared statistically. RESULTS: All samples from both groups (chlorhexidine or sterile saline) yielded viable microorganisms. There was no significant difference between the mean/median colony-forming units (CFU)/g values of both group samples, for aerobes (Streptococcus salivarius) and anaerobes (Bacteroides, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, and Veillonella species). With regard to total microorganisms, the mean CFU/g derived from the chlorhexidine group samples were 1.5 x 10(8) CFU/g per bone sample compared with 1.5 x 10(9) CFU/g for the sterile saline control group (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Although chlorhexidine rinsing immediately before surgery reduced the levels of total microorganisms when compared with stringent aspiration protocol alone, it has not been found effective on aerobic Streptococcus salivarius and, importantly, on anaerobes. The reduced bacterial levels may still carry high infectious risk and may lead to failure in autogenous grafting procedures in oral surgery.
TI  - Antibacterial action of photoactivated disinfection {PAD} used on endodontic bacteria in planktonic suspension and in artificial and human root canals.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To measure antibacterial action of photoactivated disinfection (PAD)  on endodontic bacteria in planktonic suspension and root canals. METHODS: Four bacteria, Fusobacterium nucleatum,Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella intermedia and Streptococcus intermedius, were tested in suspension. After mixing equal volumes of Tolonium chloride and bacterial suspension for 60s, each 200 microL of concentration (>10(6)cfu mL(-1)) was irradiated with light at 633+/-2 nm. Each energy dose/Tolonium chloride concentration combination was tested eight times, with controls. Prepared root canals in Training Blocs and extracted human teeth were inoculated with S. intermedius followed by 10 mg L(-1) Tolonium chloride or saline. Bacteria in canals were sampled before and after light irradiation. Student t-test assessed significance of changes in viable bacteria produced by treatment of either light or Tolonium chloride alone and light/Tolonium chloride combinations. RESULTS: In suspension, reductions in bacteria were highly significant (P<0.01) for light/Tolonium chloride combinations compared to light or Tolonium chloride alone. Maximum mean log reductions of 1.14 (P. intermedia), 2.48 (P. micros), 2.81 (F. nucleatum) and 6.73 (S. intermedius) were at 4.8 J/20 mg L(-1). Antibacterial action was increased by energy dose increase (not always significantly), but not by Tolonium chloride concentration. In control canals mean log reductions of 0.42 (Blocs) and 0.38 (teeth) from initial levels were not significant. PAD mean log reductions of 2.40 (Blocs) and 2.01 (teeth) were highly significant. Changes for PAD/energy dose combinations were not significant. CONCLUSION: PAD killed endodontic bacteria at statistically significant levels compared to controls. Kills varied with bacterial species.
TI  - Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of micro-organisms recovered from cutaneous lesions of human American tegumentary leishmaniasis in Minas Gerais, Brazil.
AB  - An evaluation of the microbiota present in cutaneous ulcers from 31 patients with a clinical and parasitological diagnosis of American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL) was carried out by the standard filter paper disc technique, including antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacterial isolates. Microbial examination indicated that 21 patients (67.7%) were contaminated with one to four bacteria and some of them also with yeast. A total of 142 micro-organisms were isolated. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently recovered bacterium (95.2% of positive patients) and was found to produce type B (70% of the staphylococcal isolates) and type C (50%) enterotoxins as well as toxic shock syndrome toxin (60%). Proteus mirabilis (33.3% of the positive patients), Streptococcus pyogenes (19.0 %), H(2)S-negative Proteus species (19.0%), Klebsiella oxytoca (14.3%), Enterobacter species (9.5%), Peptostreptococcus species (9.5%), Pseudomonas species (4.8%), Prevotella bivia (4.8%), Escherichia coli (4.8%), Streptococcus agalactiae (4.8%), Bacteroides fragilis (4.8%), Candida albicans (9.5%) and Candida tropicalis (4.8%) were also isolated. Surprisingly, Staph. aureus isolates were susceptible to almost all tested drugs, although some of them were resistant to penicillin (69%) and ampicillin + sulbactam (68%). Concerning obligate anaerobes, all the Gram-negative isolates (25% of the total) were resistant to metronidazole. The results of the present study show that microbial secondary contaminants, particularly Staph. aureus, should be considered in the diagnosis and treatment of ATL lesions.
TI  - Microbiology of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We undertook to evaluate the microbiology of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis (AECS). METHODS: Repeated aspirations of maxillary sinus secretions by endoscopy were performed in 7 patients over a period of 125 to 242 days. RESULTS: Bacteria were recovered for all 22 aspirates, and the number of isolates was between 2 and 4. A total of 54 isolates were isolated: 16 aerobic and facultative bacteria and 38 anaerobic bacteria. The aerobic bacteria were Haemophilus influenzae (7 isolates), Streptococcus pneumoniae (3), Moraxella catarrhalis (3), Staphylococcus aureus (2), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1). The anaerobic bacteria included pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp (19), Peptostreptococcus spp (9), Fusobacterium spp (8), and Propionibacterium acnes (2). A change in the types of isolates was noted in all consecutive cultures obtained from the same patients as different organisms emerged and previously isolated bacteria were no longer recovered. An increase in antimicrobial resistance was noted in 6 instances. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the microbial dynamics of AECS in which anaerobic and aerobic bacteria prevail, and highlights the importance of obtaining cultures from patients with AECS for guidance in selection of proper antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Identification of candidate periodontal pathogens and beneficial species by quantitative 16S clonal analysis.
AB  - Most studies of the bacterial etiology of periodontitis have used either culture-based or targeted DNA approaches, and so it is likely that pathogens remain undiscovered. The purpose of this study was to use culture-independent, quantitative analysis of biofilms associated with chronic periodontitis and periodontal health to identify pathogens and beneficial species. Samples from subjects with periodontitis and controls were analyzed using ribosomal 16S cloning and sequencing. Several genera, many of them uncultivated, were associated with periodontitis, the most numerous of which were gram positive, including Peptostreptococcus and Filifactor. The genera Megasphaera and Desulfobulbus were elevated in periodontitis, and the levels of several species or phylotypes of Campylobacter, Selenomonas, Deferribacteres, Dialister, Catonella, Tannerella, Streptococcus, Atopobium, Eubacterium, and Treponema were elevated in disease. Streptococcus and Veillonella spp. were found in high numbers in all samples and accounted for a significantly greater fraction of the microbial community in healthy subjects than in those with periodontitis. The microbial profile of periodontal health also included the less-abundant genera Campylobacter, Abiotrophia, Gemella, Capnocytophaga, and Neisseria. These newly identified candidates outnumbered Porphyromonas gingivalis and other species previously implicated as periodontopathogens, and it is not clear if newly identified and more numerous species may play a more important role in pathogenesis. Finally, more differences were found in the bacterial profile between subjects with periodontitis and healthy subjects than between deep and shallow sites within the same subject. This suggests that chronic periodontitis is the result of a global perturbation of the oral bacterial ecology rather than a disease-site specific microbial shift.
TI  - Genotypic characterization of bacteria cultured from duck faeces.
AB  - AIMS: To characterize the bacterial composition of mallard duck faeces and determine if novel bacterial species are present that could be utilized as potential indicators of avian faecal contamination. METHODS AND RESULTS: Combined samples of fresh faeces from four ducks were serially diluted and plated onto six different media selected to allow the growth of a range of organisms at 42 degrees C under three atmospheric conditions: aerobic, microaerophilic and anaerobic. Forty-seven morphologically dissimilar isolates were purified and partial sequencing of the16S rRNA indicated at least 31 bacterial species. Twenty of these could be identified to the species level including pathogenic species of Bacillus, Campylobacter, Clostridium and Streptococcus. Other species identified included: Enterococcus, Escherichia, Megamonas, Cellulosimicrobium, Neisseria, Staphylococcus and Veillonella. Potentially novel species, which could represent bacteria specific to avian fauna included Bacillus, Corynebacterium, Macrococcus and Peptostreptococcus, while four isolates had <97% similarity to known bacterial species in the available databases. CONCLUSION: A survey of the natural microflora of the mallard duck and its hybrid with the grey duck identified both bacteria that are potentially human pathogenic and putative novel bacteria species as determined by 16S rRNA sequencing. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides further evidence that duck faeces is a potential human health hazard, and has identified bacteria potentially useful for distinguishing duck faeces from other faecal sources.
TI  - Bacteriology of acute and chronic ethmoid sinusitis.
AB  - Aspirates from 26 acutely and 17 chronically infected ethmoid sinuses were studied. Thirty-seven aerobes and 10 anaerobes were recovered from isolates from patients with acute sinusitis. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were predominant. Twenty-seven aerobes and 41 anaerobes were found in isolates from patients with chronic sinusitis. The predominant isolates were anaerobic gram-negative bacilli and Peptostreptococcus spp.
TI  - Recovery of potential pathogens and interfering bacteria in the nasopharynx of smokers and nonsmokers.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Active smoking and passive exposure to cigarette smoke are associated with colonization by some potentially pathogenic species of bacteria and an increased risk of respiratory tract infection in both adults and children. In an attempt to explain these observations, this study compared the frequency of isolation of potential pathogens, and aerobic and anaerobic bacteria that possess interfering capabilities (ie, interfering with the in vitro growth of potential pathogens) in the nasopharynx of smokers to their recovery in nonsmokers. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal specimens for cultures were taken from 20 smokers and 20 nonsmokers. Potential pathogens, and aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with interfering capabilities against these organisms were identified. RESULTS: Fourteen potential pathogens (0.7 per patient) were isolated from nasopharyngeal cultures obtained from 11 of the 20 smokers, and 4 (0.2 per patient) were recovered from 3 of the 20 nonsmokers (p < 0.01). In vitro bacterial interference between two aerobic (alpha-hemolytic and nonhemolytic streptococci) and two anaerobic species (Prevotella and Peptostreptococcus species), and four potential pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae [non-type b], Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes) was observed. Bacterial interference was noted in 61 instances against the four potential pathogens by 22 normal flora isolates that were recovered from the group of smokers, and in 155 instances by 50 isolates from the group of nonsmokers (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These findings illustrate for the first time that the nasopharyngeal flora of smokers contains fewer aerobic and anaerobic organisms with interfering capabilities and more potential pathogens compared with those of nonsmokers.
TI  - Meningioma associated with abscess formation--a case report.
AB  - A rare case of meningioma associated with both intratumoral and peritumoral abscess formation occurred in a 38-year-old man presenting with signs and symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure, intracranial infection, and right temporal pole mass lesion. The mass lesion was totally removed, revealing a meningioma. Group B streptococcus and peptostreptococcus were cultured from both the tumor and peritumoral white matter. Hematogenous spread of the organisms related to recent dental work was the likely mechanism.
TI  - Comparison of the antimicrobial activity of six irrigants on primary endodontic pathogens.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the antimicrobial activities of 6% and 3% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), 2% and 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX), and 0.01% and 0.005% doxycycline (Doxy) on four microorganisms associated with primary endodontic infections. The agar diffusion test was used to measure antimicrobial activities of these agents against Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella intermedia, Streptococcus sanguis, and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Minimum inhibitory concentration analysis was performed using the macrodilution method. For three of the four microorganisms, the general order of antimicrobial effectiveness was 0.01% Doxy >0.005% Doxy >6% NaOCl >3% NaOCl >2% CHX > 0.12% CHX. For L. acidophilus, the order of effectiveness was 6% NaOCl >3% NaOCl >2% CHX > 0.01% Doxy >0.005% Doxy >0.12% CHX. The 6% NaOCl showed significantly greater zones of inhibition than 3% NaOCl for all endopathogens tested.
TI  - Tobacco smoking and periodontal microflora in a Saudi Arabian population.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore the subgingival periodontal microflora in a Saudi Arabian  population with a special focus on its relationship with various smoking habits. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 198 individuals in the age range 17-60 years were included in the study. 29% were water-pipe smokers, 18% cigarette smokers, 13% smokers of both water pipe and cigarettes (mixed smokers) and 40% non-smokers. For each individual, a subgingival plaque sample from the deepest site in each quadrant was obtained. The checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technology was used to determine the presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Tannerella forsythensis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponoma denticola, Peptostreptococcus micros, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Selenomonas noxia and Streptococcus intermedius. Two cut-off levels for detection were used, score 1(10(5) bacteria) and score 3 (10(6) bacteria). RESULTS: The prevalence of individuals positive for the different microorganisms at score 1 cut-off varied from 7% to 95%. At score 3 cut-off the prevalence varied from 0% to 30%. The depth of sample site was a key factor for detection. When the depth of sample site was taken into account, no statistically significant differences were observed between cigarette smokers, water-pipe smokers, and non-smokers with regard to occurrence of the microorganisms studied. CONCLUSIONS: No major differences were observed between cigarette smokers, water-pipe smokers, and non-smokers regarding the occurrence of the periodontal microorganisms studied suggesting that this portion of the subgingival periodontal microflora is independent of tobacco smoking.
TI  - Protein L-agarose for adsorption of autoantibodies: a potential tool for extracorporeal treatment.
AB  - This work investigated the adsorption of autoantibodies such as anti-SS-A/Ro, anti-SS-B/La, anti-Sm, and anti-dsDNA on protein L-agarose gel. In order to determine better conditions for IgG adsorption on this matrix, some buffer systems were tested. Adsorption data were analyzed using the Langmuir and Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm models. The experimental isotherms were best described by the Langmuir-Freundlich model, which indicated negative and positive cooperativities for binding in the presence of PBS and HEPES buffers, respectively. The K(d) values for phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) and hydroxyethylpiperazine ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) were 2.8 x 10(-7) M and 3.2 x 10(-7) M, respectively, which indicate a high affinity between IgG and the immobilized protein L. The amount of protein adsorbed per amount of protein loaded was high for anti-Sm (44%) and anti-dsDNA (46%), but low for anti-SS-B/La (9%). The amount of albumin adsorbed was lower than 0.06 mg/mL, which may remove the need for a plasma replacement solution in clinical apheresis.
TI  - Influence of denatured and intermediate states of folding on protein aggregation.
AB  - We simulate the aggregation thermodynamics and kinetics of proteins L and G, each of which self-assembles to the same alpha/beta [corrected] topology through distinct folding mechanisms. We find that the aggregation kinetics of both proteins at an experimentally relevant concentration exhibit both fast and slow aggregation pathways, although a greater proportion of protein G aggregation events are slow relative to those of found for protein L. These kinetic differences are correlated with the amount and distribution of intrachain contacts formed in the denatured state ensemble (DSE), or an intermediate state ensemble (ISE) if it exists, as well as the folding timescales of the two proteins. Protein G aggregates more slowly than protein L due to its rapidly formed folding intermediate, which exhibits native intrachain contacts spread across the protein, suggesting that certain early folding intermediates may be selected for by evolution due to their protective role against unwanted aggregation. Protein L shows only localized native structure in the DSE with timescales of folding that are commensurate with the aggregation timescale, leaving it vulnerable to domain swapping or nonnative interactions with other chains that increase the aggregation rate. Folding experiments that characterize the structural signatures of the DSE, ISE, or the transition state ensemble (TSE) under nonaggregating conditions should be able to predict regions where interchain contacts will be made in the aggregate, and to predict slower aggregation rates for proteins with contacts that are dispersed across the fold. Since proteins L and G can both form amyloid fibrils, this work also provides mechanistic and structural insight into the formation of prefibrillar species.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis of antibiotic therapy in dentistry and  stomatology].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study evaluates the efficacy of various antimicrobial treatments for orofacial infections on the basis of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) criteria. METHODS: A complete a literature search was undertaken to establish the MIC90 values of the five microorganisms most frequently isolated in odontogenic infections and the pharmacokinetic parameters of 13 antibiotics used in these infections. Pharmacokinetic simulations were then carried out with mean population parameters and efficacy indexes were calculated for the 47 treatment regimens analyzed. For drugs showing time-dependent antibacterial killing, the time above MIC (t > MIC) was calculated. For drugs with concentration-dependent bactericidal activity, the AUC/MIC was calculated. RESULTS: Amoxicillin-clavulanic (500 mg/8 h or 1000 mg/12 h) and clindamycin (300 mg/6 h) in the time-dependent killing group and moxifloxacin (400 mg/24 h) in the concentration-dependent group showed adequate efficacy indexes against the five pathogens considered to be the most commonly implicated in odontogenic infections. The spiramycin plus metronidazole combination, present in the commercial formulation Rhodogyl, did not reach satisfactory PK/PD indexes. CONCLUSION: PK/PD indexes, which are useful predictors of the potential efficacy of antibacterial therapy, were used with ontogenic infections in the present study. The PK/PD simulations showed that amoxicillin-clavulanic, clindamycin and moxifloxacin were the most suitable antibiotics for this kind of infection. Clinical trials are required to confirm that this methodology is useful in these pathologic processes.
TI  - Microbiology and management of infected neck cysts.
AB  - PURPOSE: To review and describe the microbiology, diagnosis, and management of infected neck cysts. METHOD: Review the current medical literature and current textbooks. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are the predominant aerobic isolates, while pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp., and Peptostreptococcus spp., all part of the oral flora, are the predominant anaerobes. Therapy includes administration of antibiotics effective against the causative pathogen(s). Proper selection of therapy can be guided by culture of the lesion. Surgical drainage and resection may be necessary in case of suppuration. Prevention of suppuration can be achieved by surgical removal of cysts before acquisition of infection, or removal of those recurrently infected. CONCLUSION: Recognition of the importance of the skin or the oral flora in infected neck cysts can assist in the proper selection of antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Influence of antimicrobial treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection on the intestinal microflora in Japanese macaques.
AB  - Eradication treatment for Helicobacter pylori is known to cause mild but relatively frequent adverse effects. Some adverse effects such as diarrhoea and soft stools are related to disruption of the composition of the intestinal microflora. This study investigated the microfloral changes resulting from administration of an eradication regimen using proton pump inhibitor (PPI), amoxycillin and clarithromycin. Twenty-eight laboratory-bred Japanese macaques either were administered eradication treatment by this regimen for 7 days or received no medication. Faecal samples were collected for analysis on days 0, 8 and 15, and both aerobic and anaerobic cultures were performed. Among aerobic bacteria, Streptococcus had significantly decreased by day 8, while Enterococcus and Enterobacteriaceae had significantly increased. However, the total number of aerobic bacteria was not significantly decreased from pretreatment levels 1 day after completion of treatment. The number of anaerobic bacteria did not change significantly by day 8. However, the number of Lactobacillus and the detection rate of Bifidobacterium, Peptostreptococcus and Veillonella significantly decreased by day 8, although the number of Bifidobacterium, Peptostreptococcus and Veillonella had almost recovered up to the pretreatment levels 1 week after completion of treatment (day 15). These results suggest that the alterations in the composition of the intestinal microflora caused by the antimicrobial regimen that excludes metronidazole are different from those caused by the regimen including this drug. However, the alterations in bacterial microflora had almost reversed 7 days after completion of treatment in these macaques, which supports clinical findings that diarrhoea or soft stools in humans resolve relatively quickly after a similar treatment.
TI  - Periodontal infections and pre-term low birth weight: a case-control study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pre-term delivery of low-birth-weight infants [pre-term low birth weight (PLBW)] remains a significant public health issue and a major cause of neonatal death and long-term health problems. There is a growing consensus that infections remote from fetal-placental unit may influence PLBW infants. Recent studies have suggested that maternal periodontal disease may be an independent risk factor for PLBW. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the possible link between periodontal infections and PLBW by means of clinical and microbiological data in post-partum women with low socioeconomic level. METHODS: Clinical periodontal recordings comprising dental plaque, bleeding on probing, probing pocket depth and gingival recession were performed (six sites/tooth) in a total number of 181 women (53 cases and 128 controls) within 3 days post-partum. Subgingival plaque samples from mesio-or disto-buccal aspect of randomly selected one first molar and one incisor tooth have been obtained by paperpoints and were analysed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization with respect to 12 bacterial species. In all analyses, the individual subject was the computational unit. Thus, mean values for all clinical parameters were calculated and bacterial scores from each individual sample were averaged. Statistical methods included Student's t-test, Fisher's exact test/chi(2) test, and multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The cases have gained significantly less weight during the pregnancy than did the controls (p<0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between the cases and controls with regard to the dental and periodontal parameters and the values of clinical periodontal recordings were found to be very similar (p>0.05). Mean and median scores (bacterial loads) of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Streptococcus intermedius in the subgingival plaque sampling sites were significantly higher in the controls than in the cases (p<0.05). The occurrence rates of P. intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Selenomonas noxia and S. intermedius were higher in the cases compared with the controls, but the differences were not statistically significant (p>0.05). According to the model created by the multiple logistic regression analysis, P. micros and C. rectus were found to significantly increase the risk of PLBW (p<0.01 and p<0.05 respectively), while P. nigrescens and A. actinomycetemcomitans decreased this risk (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: The present findings indicated that when subgingival bacteria were evaluated together, P. micros and C. rectus may have a role in increasing the risk for PLBW, although no single bacteria exhibited any relation with the risk of PLBW. Further studies are required to better clarify the possible relationship between periodontal diseases and PLBW.
TI  - Coaggregation profiles of the microflora from root surface caries lesions.
AB  - Bacterial coaggregation reactions between different species and the auto aggregation of the same species are associated with the initiation and development of dental plaque and biofilms. As no such data is available on isolates from root caries lesions, we evaluated, by a visual, semi-quantitative scoring system and a spectrophotometric, quantitative assay, the coaggregation of 22 different wild-type microbial species comprising ten bacterial genera and a single Candida spp. The quantitative coaggregation assay we used proved to be a more sensitive method than the semi-quantitative, visual evaluation as the results yielded the percent coaggregation. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus bovis II/2 and Gemella morbillorum were observed having higher degrees of autoaggregation than the other examined strains. Significant levels of inter-species coaggregation was seen between: (1) Actinomyces spp. and Veillonella spp.; (2) Actinomyces israelii and Peptostreptococcus prevotii; (3) Campylobacter gracilis and Actinomyces spp.; (4) Prevotella intermedia and nine different species; and (5) Fusobacterium nucleatum and six other species. The single Candida albicans isolate did not coaggregate to a significant extent with any of the 21 bacterial isolates studied. Scanning electron microscopy observation of the coaggregation interactions between bacterial pairs having strong coaggregation reactions revealed varying adhesive patterns. Our findings on coaggregation amongst these isolates imply existence of multiple interactions between the coaggregation-inducing bacterial species in root caries. In particular, Actinomyces spp., Veillonella spp., Prevotella spp. and Fusobacterium spp. appear to play a significant role in this context.
TI  - Socket infection due to retained gauze after evisceration.
AB  - A 64-year-old man had late-onset socket infection due to retained surgical gauze  after evisceration. External examination showed a mass of retained surgical gauze with copious yellowish discharge and gas bubbles. Computed tomography scans showed a 3.2 x 2.4 x 2.4-cm heterogeneous mass and numerous gas bubbles. Culture of the discharge yielded Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus viridans, Peptostreptococcus species, and Fusobacterium species. Surgical debridement and antibiotic therapy achieved a rapid resolution. Retained gauze after evisceration may lead to socket infection, and such a complication should be avoided.
TI  - Microbiological basis of oral infections and sensitivity to antibiotics.
AB  - Because oral infections are common, the physician must understand the underlying  etiology, pathogeny, and other variables that determine how these processes evolve in order to choose the most appropriate antibiotic drug. The special characteristics of the oral cavity determine the make-up of the microflora that lives there. Different anaerobic species belonging to the Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Gemella, and Porphyromonas genera are of particular interest, as are the aerobic species Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Corynebacterium. Each of these microorganisms occupies a different microniche within the oral cavity, and the prevailing balance is upset when conditions become modified as a result of illness or due to dental interventions such as tooth extraction or tooth scaling and polishing. Pathogenic or opportunistic bacteria (Actinomyces, Prevotella intermedia species, etc.) can develop in these conditions, as can yeasts (Candida sp., Histoplasma capsulatum), virus (herpes simplex, papilomavirus), and parasites (Entamoeba gingivalis, Trichomonas tenax). When infection occurs, the patients s immune system reacts by means of inborn immunity (non-specific) and acquired immunity (specific). Empirical treatment is administered that should be based on etiological data and on the antimicrobial sensitivity of the pathogen that is causing the infection. However, oral microflora sensitivity to different antibiotics is currently declining and there is a noticeable trend towards resistances. As a consequence of all this, the treatment of oral infections must also aim to restore the ecological balance of the oral cavity and to minimize the emergence of resistance in the microorganisms present in the mouth. Hence, epidemiological oral pathogen sensitivity studies must be conducted, fostering the administration of appropriate antibiotics at proper doses and keeping specialists abreast of the latest trends. In recent decades, oral infections comprise one of the most common pathologies in the general population, due in large part to infectious complications associated with poor oral hygiene. This in turn, translates into an increased need and demand for dental care, while at the same time, it requires that the professional accurately understand the etiological factors involved, as well as the pathogeny and different variables that determine the specificity of these kinds of infections, so as to be able to choose the appropriate antimicrobial drugs for proper treatment.
TI  - Microbiology and management of peritonsillar, retropharyngeal, and parapharyngeal abscesses.
AB  - This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis, and management of peritonsillar, retropharyngeal, and parapharyngeal abscesses in children. Predominant anaerobic organisms isolated in peritonsillar, lateral pharyngeal, and retropharyngeal abscesses are Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium and Peptostreptococcus spp.; aerobic organisms are group A streptococcus ( Streptococcus pyogenes ), Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae . Anaerobic bacteria can be isolated from most abscesses whenever appropriate techniques for their cultivation have been used, while S. pyogenes is isolated in only about one third of cases. More than two thirds of deep neck abscesses contain beta-lactamase producing organisms. Management of tonsillar, peritonsillar, and retropharyngeal abscesses is similar. Systemic antimicrobial therapy should be given in large doses whenever the diagnosis is made. However, when pus is formed, antimicrobial therapy is effective only in conjunction with adequate surgical drainage. Untreated abscesses can rupture spontaneously into the pharynx, causing catastrophic aspiration. Other complications are extension of infection laterally to the side of the neck or dissection into the posterior mediastinum through facial planes and the prevertebral space. Death can occur from aspiration, airway obstruction, erosion into major blood vessels, or extension to the mediastinum.
TI  - The role of sequence and structure in protein folding kinetics; the diffusion-collision model applied to proteins L and G.
AB  - The diffusion-collision model (DCM) is applied to the folding kinetics of protein L and protein G. In the DCM, the two proteins are treated as consisting of two beta-hairpins and one alpha-helix, so that they are isomorphous with the three-helix bundle DCM model. In the absence of sequence dependent factors, both proteins would fold in the same way in the DCM, with the coalescence of the N-terminal hairpin and the helix slightly favored over the C-terminal hairpin and the helix because the former are closer together than the latter. However, sequence dependent factors make the N-terminal hairpin of protein L and the C-terminal hairpin of protein G more stable in the ensemble of unfolded conformations. This difference in the stabilities gives rise to the difference in the calculated folding behavior, in agreement with experiment.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological changes associated with the use of combined antimicrobial therapies to treat "refractory" periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present investigation examined clinical and microbial changes after a combined aggressive antimicrobial therapy in subjects identified as "refractory" to conventional periodontal therapy. METHOD: Fourteen subjects were identified as "refractory" based on full-mouth mean attachment loss and/or >3 sites with attachment loss > or =3 mm following scaling and root planing (SRP), periodontal surgery and systemic antibiotics. After baseline monitoring, subjects received SRP, locally delivered tetracycline at pockets > or =4 mm, systemically administered amoxicillin (500 mg, t.i.d. for 14 days)+metronidazole (250 mg, t.i.d. for 14 days) and professional removal of supragingival plaque weekly for 3 months. Subjects were monitored clinically every 3 months post-therapy for 2 years. Subgingival plaque samples were taken at the same time points from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Mean levels of each species were averaged within a subject at each visit. Significance of changes in clinical and microbiological parameters over time were evaluated using the Friedman or Wilcoxon signed ranks test. RESULTS: On average, subjects showed significant improvements in all clinical parameters after therapy. Mean (+/-SEM) full-mouth pocket depth reduction was 0.83+/-0.13 mm and mean attachment level "gain" was 0.44+/-0.12 at 24 months. Clinical improvement was accompanied by major reductions in multiple subgingival species during the first 3 months of active therapy that were maintained for most species to the last monitoring visit. Reductions occurred for three Actinomyces species, "orange complex" species including Campylobacter showae, Eubacterium nodatum, three Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella intermedia as well as the "Streptococcus milleri" group, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus and Streptococcus intermedus. Subjects differed in their response to therapy; six modest response subjects exhibited less attachment level gain and were characterized by reductions in the microbiota from baseline to 3 months, but re-growth of many species thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: The combined antibacterial therapy was successful in controlling disease progression in 14 "refractory" periodontitis subjects for 2 years.
TI  - Intra-abdominal, retroperitoneal, and visceral abscesses in children.
AB  - This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis, and management of intra-abdominal abscesses (including subphrenic, hepatic, splenic, and retroperitoneal abscesses) in children. They often occur as a complication of local or generalized peritonitis, commonly secondary to appendicitis, necrotizing enterocolitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and tubo-ovarian infection, surgery or trauma. The original infection generally occurs because of the entry of enteric microorganisms into the peritoneal cavity through a defect in the wall of the intestine or other viscus as a result of obstruction, infarction, or direct trauma. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora can be recovered from most abscesses. The predominant aerobic isolates are Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus spp. and the main anaerobic bacteria are Bacteroides fragilis group Peptostreptococcus spp., Fusobacterium spp., and Clostridium spp. The treatment of intraabdominal abscesses includes drainage, surgical correction of pathology, and administration of antimicrobials effective against both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.
TI  - Whole-body autoradiography reveals that the Peptostreptococcus magnus immunoglobulin-binding domains of protein L preferentially target B lymphocytes in the spleen and lymph nodes in vivo.
AB  - Protein L is an immunoglobulin (Ig)-binding protein produced by the Gram-positive bacterium Peptostreptococcus magnus that interacts with the variable region of Ig kappa light chains. The Ig light chain-binding capacity of protein L gives it the potential to interact with cells expressing surface Ig such as B cells. The present study was performed to address the in vivo trafficking of protein L at both the organ and the cellular level. Using the powerful technique of whole-body autoradiography in a murine model system, we demonstrate specific targeting of protein L to secondary lymphoid tissues in whole-animal analysis. The observed targeting depends on the capacity to interact with murine Ig, as tissue targeting was not apparent in mice given protein H, an Ig-binding protein produced by Streptococcus pyogenes with affinity for human but not murine Ig. Tissue targeting data were combined with flow cytometry analysis, which demonstrated the capacity of protein L to target and activate B lymphocytes in vivo. B cells targeted by protein L had increased surface expression of CD86 and MHC-II, and protein L was present in vacuolar compartments of B cells. Protein L did not bind T cells or natural killer cells but had some capacity to target dendritic cells and macrophages. The data show that protein L preferentially targets secondary lymphoid organs, and activates and is internalized by B cells in vivo. Furthermore, the observed tissue and cell targeting properties require an affinity for murine Ig. These data support the potential use of this Ig-binding protein as a targeting approach to deliver agents to defined cell populations in vivo.
TI  - The bacteriology of the supragingival plaque of child dental patients in Kuwait.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the bacterial flora of the gingival plaques of pediatric dental patients in order to establish baseline data for future studies on the complex microbiota of the oral cavity of this group of child dental patients. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Forty subjects, aged 3-12 years, were enrolled and investigated after informed consent was obtained. During the patients' first visit to the dental clinic supragingival plaque samples were collected from the gingival area of buccal and lingual tooth surfaces of all primary and permanent molar teeth using sterile curettes. Serially diluted samples were inoculated onto a set of selective and nonselective media and then incubated at the appropriate atmospheric conditions and temperatures. Representative colonies of isolates were identified by standard methods, including hemolytic characteristics on blood agar and profiling on API 20S and API 20A as appropriate. RESULTS: A total of 183 isolates (123 aerobes and 60 anaerobes) were recovered from the 40 patients with a mean count of 3 per sample of aerobes compared to 1.5 per sample for the anaerobes. Streptococcus sanguis was the predominant aerobic species (23.6%) isolated from 29 (72.5%) of the 40 patients, followed by Streptococcus mitis, 19.5 and 60%, Streptococcus salivarius, 17.1 and 52.5% and Streptococcus mutans, 17.1 and 52.5%. The frequency of isolation of anaerobic bacteria was Prevotella spp. 50% from 30 (75%) of the 40 patients, Fusobacterium spp., 18.3 and 27.5%, Bacteroides spp., Porphyromonas spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp., 6.7 and 10%, 6.7 and 10%, and 5 and 7.5%, respectively. Prevotella intermedia was the single most common species. CONCLUSION: The results show that there were more aerobic/facultative anaerobic bacteria than the obligate anaerobes in the dental plaque of the pediatric dental patients in Kuwait. The high prevalence of the pioneering streptococci as well as black-pigmented Prevotella spp. and Fusobacterium spp. indicates that the dental plaques of the children were in the developing stage, a precursor to the development of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Apical periodontitis development and bacterial response to endodontic treatment.  Experimental root canal infections in monkeys with selected bacterial strains.
AB  - In six monkeys, 160 root canals were inoculated with a combination of four bacterial strains belonging to species Streptococcus milleri, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella oralis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. In two other monkeys, 24 root canals were inoculated with a five-strain combination consisting of these strains and a strain of Enterococcus faecalis. All strains were previously isolated from an infected monkey root canal. After 8-12 months, survival of the strains was recorded bacteriologically, and the reaction in the periapical region was radiographed. From 180 of 184 root canals, one or more of the bacterial strains were reisolated. The two facultative strains were more frequently reisolated than the anaerobic strains. Apical periodontitis was registered in the periapical region of more than 96% of root canals with reisolated bacteria but in none of those without reisolated bacteria. Endodontic treatment was carried out in two sessions with an interval of 14 d without interappointment dressings, and the effect was evaluated bacteriologically before and after each treatment. The chemo-mechanical treatment reduced significantly the number of strains and bacterial cells. The facultative bacteria were more resistant to the treatment than the anaerobic bacteria. The five-strain combination had a higher survival rate than the four-strain combination.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance profile of the subgingival microbiota following systemic or local tetracycline therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tetracyclines have been extensively used as adjunctives to conventional periodontal therapy. Emergence of resistant strains, however, has been reported. This study evaluated longitudinally the tetracycline resistance patterns of the subgingival microbiota of periodontitis subjects treated with systemic or local tetracycline therapy+scaling and root planing (SRP). METHODS: Thirty chronic periodontitis patients were randomly assigned to three groups: SRP+500 mg of systemic tetracycline twice/day for 14 days; SRP alone and SRP+tetracycline fibers (Actsite) at four selected sites for 10 days. Subgingival plaque samples were obtained from four sites with probing pocket depths (PPD)> or =6 mm in each patient at baseline, 1 week, 3, 6 and 12 months post-therapy. Samples were dispersed and diluted in pre-reduced anaerobically sterilized Ringer's solution, plated on Trypticase Soy Agar (TSA)+5% blood with or without 4 microg/ml of tetracycline and incubated anaerobically for 10 days. The percentage of resistant microorganisms were determined and the isolates identified by DNA probes and the checkerboard method. Significance of differences among and within groups over time was sought using the Kruskal-Wallis and Friedman tests, respectively. RESULTS: The percentage of resistant microorganisms increased significantly at 1 week in the tetracycline groups, but dropped to baseline levels over time. The SRP+Actsite group presented the lowest proportions of resistant species at 6 and 12 months. No significant changes were observed in the SRP group. The predominant tetracycline-resistant species included Streptococcus spp., Veillonela parvula, Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella intermedia, Gemella morbillorum and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa). A high percentage of sites with resistant Aa, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tanerella forsythensis was observed in all groups at baseline. However, T. forsythensis was not detected in any group and P. gingivalis was not present in the SRP+Actsite group at 1 year post-therapy. Aa was still frequently detected in all groups after therapy. However, the greatest reduction was observed in the SRP+Actsite group. CONCLUSION: Local or systemically administered tetracycline results in transitory selection of subgingival species intrinsically resistant to this drug. Although the percentage of sites harboring periodontal pathogens resistant to tetracycline were quite elevated in this population, both therapies were effective in reducing their prevalence over time.
TI  - The use of PCR for the identification and characterisation of bacteriocin genes from bacterial strains isolated from rumen or caecal contents of cattle and sheep.
AB  - PCR primers were designed to amplify the gene that encodes bovicin 255 from Streptococcus gallolyticus LRC0255 and the bacteriocin genes from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens strains AR10 and OR79A (bviD and bvi79A) in order to screen for their incidence in rumen and caecal B. fibrisolvens and Streptococcus bovis-like isolates from New Zealand and North American ruminants. None of the B. fibrisolvens-like strains (n=34) isolated from New Zealand or North America had the genes encoding for butyrivibriocins AR10 (bviD) or OR79 (bvi79A). However, seven S. bovis isolates from New Zealand ruminants and three from North American animals had the bovicin 255 gene. Sequence comparison of cloned bovicin 255 PCR products indicated a 92.9-95.7% similarity to that of the corresponding bovicin 255 gene sequence of S. gallolyticus. Four of the New Zealand bovicin 255 positive S. bovis isolates were from the caecal contents of the same sheep and had identical PFGE profiles. Two other S. bovis isolates sharing the same PFGE profile were isolated from a separate animal from the same flock. PFGE analysis of the North American strains indicated that all three were closely related as two of three had identical PFGE profiles with the remaining isolate differing only by a single band position. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of the 10 isolates were at least 99.8% identical to S. bovis. All 10 S. bovis isolates having the gene for bovicin 255 produced bacteriocin activity that inhibited the growth of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius D1 in a deferred antagonism plating (DAP) assay. Certain S. bovis isolates obtained from ruminants have bacteriocin activity associated with a distinct bovicin 255 gene sequence but it appears that bacteriocin production by the rumen anaerobe B. fibrisolvens may be uncommon in strains isolated from cattle and sheep in New Zealand.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of oral Cephems against various clinically isolated strains].
AB  - We determined the antibacterial activities of oral Cephems against isolated from  the patients with the respiratory infections, the urinary tract infections, and infections in the obstetrics field of an adult and a child, during the period from 2002 to 2003; Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli of 40 strains of each, and Peptostreptococcus spp. 22 strains. S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae strains that resistant is regarded were collected mainly, penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) and beta-lactamase negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae (BLNAR) strains. The MICs of Cephems except cefaclor (CCL) were < or = 0.03 microgram/mL against all strains of S. pyogenes. The MICs of cefteram (CFTM) and cefditoren (CDTR) were < or = 0.0125 microgram/mL activity against 7 strains penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP). However the MIC90s of cefditoren (CDTR) was 1 microgram/mL, cefteram (CFTM), and cefcapene (CFPN) were 2 micrograms/mL against PISP and PRSP, were higher than those of other drugs, but showed slightly higher than PSSP. The MIC90s of Cephems. were 0.5-4 micrograms/mL against strains of E. coli. The MIC90s of CFTM was 0.5 microgram/mL, and CDTR, CFPN were 1 microgram/mL against E. coli were higher than those of other drugs. The four strains of E. coli however were highly-resistant which MIC90s of CCL were more than 32 micrograms/mL were obtains. Furthermore it is necessary to pay much attention to the trend of resistant such as E. coli of Cephems. Although all strains showed resistant to AMPC, MIC90 of Cephems were 0.25-1 microgram/mL, good activities against K. pneumoniae. Against beta-lactamase negative ampicillin-susceptible H. influenzae (BLNAS) 23 strains the MIC90s of CCL and other Cephems were 64 micrograms/mL and 0.25-8 micrograms/mL. The MIC90s of CDTR and CFTM were < or = 1 microgram/mL of BLNAR (15 strains). However there of CFDN and CPDX were 8 micrograms/mL and CCL were > or = 16 micrograms/mL. Two strains which were produced beta-lactamase were highly--ABPC resistant. Although B. catarrhalis all strains were produced beta-lactamase and Cephems except for CCL showed better susceptibility than AMPC. The MIC90s of Cephems were 0.25-2 micrograms/mL against Peptostreptococcus spp.
TI  - Human beta-defensins 2 and 3 demonstrate strain-selective activity against oral microorganisms.
AB  - Human beta-defensins 2 and 3 (HBD-2 and HBD-3) are inducible peptides present at  sites of infection in the oral cavity. A few studies have reported broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity for both peptides. However, no comprehensive study has thoroughly investigated their potential against oral pathogens. The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of HBD-2 and HBD-3 against a collection of oral organisms (Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Peptostreptococcus micros, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, and Candida albicans). Radial diffusion assays were used to test HBD-2 and HBD-3 activities against at least three strains of each species. There was significant variability in MICs, which was strain specific rather than species specific. MICs ranged from 3.9 to >250 micro g/ml for HBD-2 and from 1.4 to >250 micro g/ml for HBD-3. HBD-3 demonstrated greater antimicrobial activity and was effective against a broader array of organisms. Overall, aerobes were 100% susceptible to HBD-2 and HBD-3, whereas only 21.4 and 50% of the anaerobes were susceptible to HBD-2 and HBD-3, respectively. HBD-2 and HBD-3 also demonstrated strain-specific activity against the Candida species evaluated. Interestingly, an association between HBD-2 and HBD-3 activities was noted. This suggests that the two peptides may have similar mechanisms yet utilize distinct pathways. The lack of activity against specific anaerobic strains and Candida warrants further investigation of the potential resistance mechanisms of these organisms. Finally, the significant variability between strains underlies the importance of testing multiple strains when evaluating activities of antimicrobial peptides.
TI  - Microbiological examination of infected dental root canals.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the root canal microbiota of primary and secondary root-infected canals and the association of constituent species with specific endodontic signs and symptoms. METHODS: Microbial samples were taken from 60 root canals, 41 with necrotic pulp tissues (primary infection) and 19 with failed endodontic treatment (secondary infection). Strict anaerobic techniques were used for serial dilution, plating, incubation and identification. RESULTS: A total of 224 cultivable isolates were recovered belonging to 56 different bacterial species. Individual root canals yielded a maximum of 10 bacterial species. Of the bacterial isolates, 70% were either strict anaerobes or microphilic. The anaerobes most frequently isolated were: Peptostreptococcus micros (35%), Fusobacterium necrophorum (23.3%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (11.7%), Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (16.7%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%) and Porphyromonas endodontalis (5%). The root canal microflora of untreated teeth with apical periodontitis was found to be mixed, comprising gram-negative and gram-positive and mostly anaerobic microorganisms and usually containing more than 3 species per canal. On the other hand, facultative anaerobic and gram-positive bacteria predominated in canals with failed endodontic treatment, which harbored 1-2 species per canal. Suggested relationships were found between anaerobes, especially gram-negatives, and the presence or history of pain, tenderness to percussion and swelling (P<0.05). In particular, associations were found between: a) pain (n=29) and P. micros (P<0.01), P. intermedia/nigrescens and Eubacterium spp. (both P<0.05); b) history of pain (n=31) and P. micros (P<0.01) Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium spp. (P<0.05); c) tenderness to percussion (n=29) and Porphyromonas spp. (P<0.01), Peptostreptococcus and Fusobacterium spp. (P<0.001); d) swelling (n=20) and Peptostreptococcus spp. (P<0.01), Porphyromonas and Enterococcus spp. (P<0.05); e) wet canals (n=33) and Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium spp. (P<0.05); f) purulent exudate (n=20) and Porphyromonas, Peptostreptococcus and Fusobacterium spp. (P<0.05); previous endodontic treatment and Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus spp., P. micros, F. necrophorum (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate potential complex interactions of species resulting in characteristic clinical pictures which cannot be achieved by individual species alone. They also indicate that the microbiota of primary infected canals with apical periodontitis differs in number and in species from the secondary infected canals by using the culture technique.
TI  - Bacteremia following surgical dental extraction with an emphasis on anaerobic strains.
AB  - Our aim was to investigate bacteremia caused by surgical extraction of partly erupted mandibular third molars. From 16 young adults, bacterial samples were taken from the third-molar pericoronal pocket and post-operatively from the extraction socket, and blood samples were drawn from the ante-cubital vein up to 30 min after surgery. Of the subjects, 88% had detectable bacteremia-50% 1 min after the incision, 44% immediately after extraction. The respective percentages at 10, 15, and 30 min were 44%, 25%, and 13%. Blood cultures contained 31 species (74% anaerobes), with 3.9 +/- 2.6 species isolated per subject. Most prevalent were the anaerobes Prevotella, Eubacterium, and Peptostreptococcus sp. and the aerobes viridans-group streptococci and Streptococcus milleri group. Any species found in the blood was also isolated from the mouth, from 93% of the pericoronal pockets and from 43% of the extraction sockets. Surgical dental extraction clearly causes bacteremia of a high frequency and lasting longer than thus far assumed.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial susceptibility for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (2,363 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), Streptococcus milleri group and Peptostreptococcus spp. The antibacterial activity of CZOP either against MSSA or MSSE was preferable (MIC90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/mL) and comparable to those of other cephems. CZOP was also effective on MRSE (MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) but not on MRSA. CZOP and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (CPR; MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) and higher than those of other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, like other drugs. The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and CPR (MIC90: < or = 0.063 microgram/mL), and, against S. agalactiae, was also preferable (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL). CZOP indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against PSSP, PISP, or PRSP (MIC90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. milleri group was also preferable, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 95.9% in MRSA, 93.5% in PRSP, 63.3% in PISP, 35.8% in S. haemolyticus, 27.9% in E. faecalis, and 13.3% MRSE. Those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (CFPM), but E. faecalis showed 91.2% for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. In correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of PRSP was not inhibited at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or CFPM while 69.2% at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or ceftazidime. In conclusion, the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. A decline in the sensitivities of S. saprophyticus, S. milleri group, PISP, and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested.
TI  - Frozen cancellous bone allografts: positive cultures of implanted grafts in posterior fusions of the spine.
AB  - We have carried out a study on the behaviour pattern of implanted allografts initially stored in perfect conditions (aseptically processed, culture-negative and stored at -80 degrees C) but which presented positive cultures at the implantation stage. There is no information available on how to deal with this type of situation, so our aim was to set guidelines on the course of action which would be required in such a case. This was a retrospective study of 112 patients who underwent a spinal arthrodesis and in whom a total of 189 allograft pieces were used. All previous bone and blood cultures and tests for hepatitis B and C, syphilis and HIV (via PCR techniques) were negative. The allografts were stored by freezing them at -80 degrees C. A sample of the allograft was taken for culture in the operating theatre just before its implantation in all cases. The results of the cultures were obtained 3-5 days after the operation. There were 22 allografts with positive culture results (12%) after implantation. These allografts were implanted in 16 patients (14%). Cultures were positive for staphylococci coagulase negative (ECN) in 10 grafts (46%), Pseudomonas stutzeri in two grafts (9%), Corynebacterium jeikeium in two grafts (9%), staphylococci coagulase positive in two grafts (9%) and for each of the following organisms in one case each (4%): Corynebacterium spp., Actinomyces odontolyticus, Streptococcus mitis, Peptostreptococcus spp., Rhodococcus equi and Bacillus spp. No clinical infection was seen in any of these patients. Positive cultures could be caused by non-detected contamination at harvesting, storing or during manipulation before implantation. The lack of clinical signs of infection during the follow-up of our patients may indicate that no specific treatment different from our antibiotic protocol is required in the case of positive culture results of a graft piece after implantation.
TI  - Normal ocular features, conjunctival microflora and intraocular pressure in the Canadian beaver (Castor canadensis).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the ocular features, normal conjunctival bacterial and fungal flora, and intraocular pressure (IOP) in the Canadian beaver (Castor canadensis). SAMPLE POPULATION: Sixteen, apparently healthy beavers with no evidence of ocular disease, and live-trapped in regions throughout Prince Edward Island. PROCEDURES: The beavers were sedated with intramuscular ketamine (12-15 mg/kg). Two culture specimens were obtained from the ventral conjunctival sac of both eyes of 10/16 beavers for aerobic and anaerobic bacterial and fungal identifications. The anterior ocular structures of all beavers were evaluated using a transilluminator and slit lamp biomicroscope. Palpebral fissure length (11/16 beavers), and horizontal and vertical corneal diameters (10/16 beavers) were measured. IOPs were measured in both eyes of 11/16 beavers using applanation tonometry. Both eyes of 3/16 beavers and one eye of 1/16 beavers were dilated using topical tropicamide prior to sedation to effect timely maximal dilation. Culture specimens and IOPs were not evaluated in these four animals. Indirect ophthalmoscopy was performed on 7/8 eyes of these four beavers. RESULTS: Conjunctival specimens from all eyes cultured positively for one or more isolates of aerobic bacteria. The most common isolate was Micrococcus spp. (five beavers; 9/20 eyes). Other isolates included a Gram-positive coccobacilli-like organism (four beavers; 7/20 eyes), Aeromonas hydrophila (three beavers; 4/20 eyes), Staphylococcus spp. (three beavers; 4/20 eyes), Gram positive bacilli (one beaver; 2/20 eyes), Enterobacter spp. (two beavers; 2/20 eyes), Streptococcus spp. (two beavers; 2/20 eyes), aerobic diphtheroids (one beaver; 1/20 eyes), and Pseudomonas spp. (one beaver; 1/20 eyes). Clostridium sordellii (one beaver; 1/20 eyes) and Peptostreptococcus spp. (one beaver; 1/20 eyes) were the sole anaerobic bacteria isolated. All conjunctival specimens were negative for growth of fungi. Ophthalmic examinations revealed the normal beaver eye and ocular adnexa included dorsal and ventral puncta, a vestigial third eyelid, and a circular pupil. Average palpebral fissure length was 9.36 mm (SD = 1.00) for both eyes. Mean horizontal and vertical corneal diameters of both eyes were 9.05 mm (SD = 0.64) and 8.45 mm (SD = 0.69), respectively. Mean IOP for the right and left eyes were 17.11 mmHg (SD = 6.39) and 18.79 mmHg (SD = 5.63), respectively. Indirect ophthalmoscopic examinations revealed normal anangiotic retinas. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-positive aerobes were most commonly cultured from the conjunctival sac of normal beavers, with Micrococcus spp. predominating. The overall mean IOP in ketamine-sedated beavers was 17.95 mmHg. The beaver, an amphibious rodent, has an anangiotic retina.
TI  - Clinical presentation and bacteriologic analysis of infected human bites in patients presenting to emergency departments.
AB  - Previous studies of infected human bites have been limited by small numbers of patients and suboptimal microbiologic methodology. We conducted a multicenter prospective study of 50 patients with infected human bites. Seventy percent of the patients and assailants were young adult men. Fifty-six percent of injuries were clenched-fist injuries and 44% were occlusional bites. Most injuries were to the hands. Fifty-four percent of patients were hospitalized. The median number of isolates per wound culture was 4 (3 aerobes and 1 anaerobe); aerobes and anaerobes were isolated from 54% of wounds, aerobes alone were isolated from 44%, and anaerobes alone were isolated from 2%. Isolates included Streptococcus anginosus (52%), Staphylococcus aureus (30%), Eikenella corrodens (30%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (32%), and Prevotella melaninogenica (22%). Candida species were found in 8%. Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, and Candida species were isolated more frequently from occlusional bites than from clenched-fist injuries. Many strains of Prevotella and S. aureus were beta-lactamase producers. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and moxifloxacin demonstrated excellent in vitro activity against common isolates.
TI  - Bacteriologic findings in patients with chronic sinusitis.
AB  - We studied the bacteriology of maxillary sinus aspirates obtained from patients diagnosed with chronic sinusitis. We recovered 659 strains from 510 aspirates; of these, 572 (86.8%) were aerobes and 87 (13.2%) were anaerobes. Aerobes only were recovered from 310 of the 510 specimens (60.8%) and anaerobes only from 31 (6.1%). Among the 572 aerobic bacteria, the most prevalent organisms were Streptococcus viridans (158 strains [27.6%]), Streptococcus pneumoniae (67 [11.7%]), Corynebacterium species (66 [11.5%]), Staphylococcus aureus (54 [9.4%]), Moraxella catarrhalis (38 [6.6%]), Hemophilus parainfluenzae (33 [5.8%]), and group C beta-hemolytic streptococci (26 [4.5%]). Among the 87 recovered anaerobes were species of Peptostreptococcus (32 strains [36.8%]), Prevotella (22 [25.3%]), Actinomyces (13 [14.9%]), Propionibacterium (11 [12.6%]), Fusobacterium (8 [9.2%]), and Veillonella (1 [1.1%]). Beta-lactamase production was detected in 115 of the 572 aerobic strains (20.1%) and in 10 of the 87 anaerobic strains (11.5%). We found that the prevalence and type of organisms we identified in chronic sinusitis did not differ substantially from those reported in previous studies. Our study is one of the more extensive reports on the type and prevalence of pathogens in chronic sinusitis that has been published to date.
TI  - Microbiology and management of endodontic infections in children.
AB  - The first step in the origination of caries is the formation of a dental plaque.  Dental caries can lead to destruction of enamel and dentin resulting in bacterial invasion of the pulp. Invasion of the pulp and the periapical areas can promote the development of dento-alveolar abscess and spread of the infection to other anatomical areas. Several oral acid producing aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Actinomyces viscosus, are capable of initiating the carious lesion. The organisms that predominate in pulpitis and dento-alveolar abscess are Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, and Peptostreptococcus spp. Treatment of caries involves removal of all affected tooth structure and proper replacement with a restorative material. Once pulpitis has developed the infected tissue should be removed and root canal therapy instituted, or the tooth should be extracted. Extraction, root canal therapy and/or drainage of pus usually are indicated for an abscess. Antimicrobial therapy supplementing the dental care should be considered, especially when local or systemic spread of the infection is suspected. Penicillin or amoxicillin are generally effective against most of the aerobic and anaerobic bacteria recovered. The patient whose oral cavity may harbor penicillin-resistant organisms should be considered for treatment with drugs effective against these organisms. These agents include amoxicillin-clavulanate, clindamycin or the combination of metronidazole plus amoxicillin or a macrolide.
TI  - Planning of empirical antibiotic therapy for women with pelvic inflammatory diseases: a geographical area-specific study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Elaboration of an empiric antibiotic regimen for women with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) for a geographical area in eastern Hungary. STUDY DESIGN: Pathogens were identified by culturing or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from 2215 patients with suspected PID between 1 January 1999 and 31 December 2001. Empiric guidelines for PID treatment were based on susceptibility testing of the recovered bacteria, patient acceptance and cost-effectiveness of drugs and recommendations of earlier studies. RESULTS: Chlamydia trachomatis was detected in 11%, Neisseria gonorrhoeae in 2%, Streptococcus spp. in 17%, Enterococcus spp. 9%, genital mycoplasmas in 25%, all obligate anaerobic pathogens in 30% of the patients. All antibiotics chosen for our regimen were effective in vitro against one or more recovered pathogens at least in 80%; this regimen produced 98% clinical cure rate in mild cases of PID. CONCLUSION: Early detection and prompt empirical antimicrobial therapy adapted to the local microflora and its resistance pattern can lead to good clinical results.
TI  - Infection-associated hemophagocytic syndrome in a diabetic patient undergoing chronic hemodialysis.
AB  - Hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) is an uncommon but severe illness associated with a variety of infections, malignant tumors, and autoimmune diseases. We report a case of infection-associated HPS in a patient receiving chronic hemodialysis. Peptostreptococcus-induced sepsis and abscess formation in the left iliopsoas muscle led to the onset of infection-associated HPS in this patient. The patient had diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease, and it is likely that immunological dysfunctions from these disorders played a part in the onset of both severe bacterial infections and HPS.
TI  - Importance of sequence specificity for predicting protein folding pathways: perturbed Gaussian chain model.
AB  - Recent experimental and theoretical studies suggest that rates and pathways of protein folding are largely decided by topology of the native structures, at least for small proteins. However, some exceptions are known; for example, protein L and protein G have the same topology, but exhibit different characteristics of the TSE. Thus, folding pathways of some proteins are critically affected by detailed information on amino acid sequences. To investigate the sequence specificity, we calculate folding pathways of 20 small proteins using the perturbed Gaussian chain model developed by Portman et al. (Phys Rev Lett 1998;81:5237-5240; J Chem Phys 2001;114:5069-5081). Characteristics of the TSE predicted by the model are in good agreement with experimental phi-value data for many proteins at coarse-grained level. Especially, estimation of folding TSE for protein G and protein L based on both topology and additional sequence information are consistent with experimental phi-value data. With only topology information, however, the model predicts the TSE of protein G incorrectly. Moreover, the model that uses topology and sequence information describes free energy profiles of two-state and three-state folders consistently with experiment, whereas the topology only model predicts free energy profiles of some proteins incorrectly. This indicates that sequence specificity also has critical roles in determining the folding pathways for some proteins.
TI  - [The presence of bacteria and yeast like fungi in specimens from surgical patients].
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of Candida spp. strains in specimens obtained from surgically treated patients as well as to analyze the accompanying bacterial flora, both aerobic and anaerobic. The material came from two groups of patients. In the first group consisting of patients operated for colon and rectum carcinoma, the samples included peritoneal fluid, colon or rectum bioptates, pus, blood, and wound swabs. In the other group, biopsy material and smears from post operation wounds were taken from patients who underwent a surgical treatment of larynx carcinoma. Altogether, 282 various clinical specimens from 165 patients were analysed, and 41 Candida spp. strains were isolated: 39 strains of C. albicans and 2 strains of C. tropicalis. In 20 out of 41 specimens infected with Candida spp. (48.8%) the co-infection with bacterial aerobic flora was found. In 10 cases (24.4%), the fungi were isolated together with aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora, whereas in 2 specimens (4.9%) the anaerobes and Candida albicans were diagnosed. The remaining 9 samples showed only the presence of Candida spp. (21.9%). From among aerobic bacterial flora Enterococcus spp. strains (n = 17) and Gram negative rods from Enterobacteriaceae family (n = 13) were the most frequently isolated. The bacterial strains of Streptococcus spp. (n = 5), Pseudomonas spp. (n = 3), Staphylococcus spp. and Corynebacterium spp. (2 strains, both) were identified more rarely. Bacteroides spp. were the most frequent members of bacterial anaerobic flora (n = 10). Other isolated anaerobic bacteria were classified as Fusobacterium spp. or Peptostreptococcus spp. (1 strain each). E. coli and Enterococcus spp. strains of aerobic bacterial flora were more frequently isolated together with Candida spp. CONCLUSIONS: (i) Mixed bacterial flora was found to predominate in the clinical material from the patients after surgery. (ii) Candida spp. were most frequently found together with aerobic bacterial flora.
TI  - Fermentation of five sucrose isomers by human dental plaque bacteria.
AB  - Sucrose has five structural isomers: palatinose, trehalulose, turanose, maltulose and leucrose. Although these isomers have been reported to be noncariogenic disaccharides, which cannot be utilized by mutans streptococci, there is no information about their fermentability by other bacteria in dental plaque. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether these isomers were fermented by predominant bacteria in human dental plaque. Clinical bacterial isolates obtained from dental plaque from 3 children aged 22 months to 50 months (146 strains) were inoculated into 3 ml of peptone-yeast extract (PY medium) containing glucose for 1 day, then an aliquot of 20 microl of culture medium was inoculated into 1 ml of PY medium containing 1% (w/v) of the respective test carbohydrates. After incubation for 1 day, the pH values and the optical density at 660 nm of the cultures were measured. Fermentation ability was measured by pH <or=5.5, growth by an OD(660) of >or=0.5. Of the clinical isolates, 33% fermented palatinose, and 69% of these were Actinomyces species. All of the palatinose-fermenting bacterial strains fermented trehalulose, 25% fermented turanose, 70% fermented maltulose and 23% fermented leucrose. We therefore conclude that, in human dental plaque, there are significant numbers of bacteria that are able to ferment sucrose isomers.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. A total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, and Peptostreptococcus spp. CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.
TI  - Microbial dynamics of purulent nasopharyngitis in children.
AB  - This review presents the microbiological dynamic and therapeutic options in the management of purulent nasopharyngitis (NPT). The nasopharynx (NP) of healthy children is generally colonized by relatively non-pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic organisms, some of, which possess the ability to interfere with the growth of potential pathogens. Conversely, carriage of potential respiratory aerobic pathogen such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, as well as some anaerobic bacteria (Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium and Prevotella spp.) increases during purulent NPT. The development of purulent NPT in children is associated with the pre-existing colonization by potential pathogens and the absence of interfering organisms in the NP. Controversy exists regarding the management of NPT as no conclusive evidence exists to date that the administration of antimicrobials will shorten the illness.
TI  - [Brain abscesses after extracranial infections of the head and neck area].
AB  - The authors report on 20 immunocompetent patients with brain abscess after 12 cases of middle ear, seven tooth and a single frontal sinus infection. The clinical aspects, hematochemical and microbiological data, the role of imaging diagnostics (CT, MR) and the type of treatment are analysed. Neurosurgery was performed on 17 patients (85%), eight of whom subsequently underwent evacuation of the primary source of infection (four mastoidectomies, two timpanoplasties, two tooth extractions). Mastoidectomy was eventually carried out on one of the three patients who did not undergo neurosurgery. Microbiological diagnosis was possible in nine patients through culture examination: Proteus mirabilis in three cases, Peptostreptococcus sp. in two, Micrococcus varians, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus viridans not typed in single cases. The pus was sterile in eight patients (47.1% of those operated). An association of two antimicrobial agents was used in 18 patients, while in two cases monotherapy was preferred, based on the isolated bacteria. Treatment lasted on average 38 days. The most frequently used therapy regimen (75%) was the association of a beta-lactam drug with chloramphenicol or metronidazole. Therapy was successful in 19/20 patients; one patient died. There was no significant difference in prognostic terms with regard to sex, age, duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis, clinical picture at onset, number and size of abscesses or type of treatment. Recognising the first clinical signs and symptoms (headache, fever, alterations in consciousness, focal neurological deficit, epileptic seizures) is extremely important for prompt diagnosis of brain abscess.
TI  - [Comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro activity of ertapenem (MK-0826), a new carbapenem, was studied against 389 aerobic microorganisms (187 Enterobacteriaceae, 15 Aeromonas spp., 42 Staphylococcus spp., 43 Streptococcus spp., 15 Enterococcus spp., 30 Haemophilus spp., 15 Moraxella catarrhalis, 12 Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 15 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 15 Acinetobacter spp.) and 54 anaerobic isolates (15 Clostridium spp., 12 Peptostreptococcus spp. and 27 fragilis group Bacteroides recovered from four Spanish hospitals. Ertapenem activity was compared with that of imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefepime, and norfloxacin. Ertapenem was the most active antibiotic against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC(90) < or =0.5 mg/l) particularly in the case of broad-spectrum, extended-spectrum and chromosomally encoded AmpC betalactamase-producing strains. Ertapenem exhibited less activity, even lower than that of imipenem, against P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp. and enterococci (MIC(90) > or =16 mg/l). Ertapenem was active against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, beta-haemolytic streptococci, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) < or =1 mg/l). In the case of Haemophilus spp., M. catarrhalis and N. gonorrhoeae, ertapenem, with a MIC(90) < or =0.06 mg/l resulted the most active antibiotic tested. When considering the anaerobes, ertapenem displayed a broad spectrum of activity, similar to that of imipenem, against Clostridium spp. (MIC(90) 2 mg/l) and was slightly less active against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC(90) 0.5 mg/l). Both carbapenems were the most active among the tested compounds. Due to its activity against almost all pathogens studied, ertapenem appears to be an option for the treatment of mixed bacterial infections.
TI  - Bacteriological study of root canals associated with periapical abscesses.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify microorganisms from root canals  with periapical abscesses and to ascertain the susceptibility of Peptostreptococcus prevotii and Fusobacterium necrophorum to antimicrobials. Study design Thirty root canals were microbiologically sampled by using sterile paper points. The concomitant microorganisms were identified through the use of established methods. The susceptibility of P prevotii and F necrophorum to antimicrobials was evaluated by using the E test method. RESULTS: A total of 117 different bacterial strains were recovered, including 75 strict anaerobes or microphilic species. The most frequently isolated strict anaerobes were P prevotii, Peptostreptococcus micros, and F necrophorum. Facultative bacteria such as Gemella morbillorum and Streptococcus mitis were also found, albeit less frequently. The data revealed that P prevotii and F necrophorum were susceptible to the tested antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-positive anaerobic bacteria predominate in the mixed microbiota of root canals with periapical abscesses. Moreover, P prevotii and F necrophorum are susceptible to the tested antibiotics.
TI  - Six cases of bacterial infection in porous orbital implants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We present 6 cases of bacterial infection that developed after porous orbital implant surgery. CASES: Five patients with hydroxyapatite implants showed lid swelling, discharge, and suppurative granuloma 14 days to 3 years after surgery. The hydroxyapatite implants were removed 14 days to 41 months postoperatively, and synthetic porous polyethylene orbital implants were inserted. Thick discharge and conjunctival melting was noted 14 months after primary Medpor implant surgery in the sixth patient, and the infection was controlled by medical therapy. OBSERVATIONS: The culture of specimens removed with swabs from the conjunctiva of patients and from the hydroxyapatite implants showed growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus and peptostreptococcus in 4 patients, whereas Streptococcus pyogenes were cultured from the conjunctiva in the Medpor implant patient. Culture for the remaining patient was negative . CONCLUSIONS: If there is continuous pain, injection, and discharge after porous implant insertion, bacterial infection in the implant should be considered immediately. Systemic antibiotics and topical eye drops should be administered without delay. If no improvement is observed, the implant should be removed and a different approach must be considered.
TI  - [Cerebral abscesses of oral origin].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: It has been suggested that between 3% and 13% of the cerebral abscesses (CA) are presumably associated to oral infections or dental procedures. AIM: Determine the prevalence of CA of oral origin, discussing their clinical and microbiological characteristics. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospectively, 54 cases of CA diagnosed in 3 hospitals of Galicia between 2001 and 2002 were reviewed. RESULTS: A presumed oral portal of entry was recorded in 6 patients (11.1%); 4 cases were associated to oral infections and the remaining 2 had received dental treatment in the months prior to the onset of symptoms. Half of the patients showed irrelevant medical record, 2 had had previous extracranial abscesses and 1 presented a type A immunoglobulin deficiency. In 4 cases, the microbiological analysis was positive and typical oral bacteria (Streptococcus viridans and Peptostreptococcus spp.) were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that a significant number of CA are probably of oral origin. In consequence, to maintain a good oral health status is important and specific prophylactic measures before any dental procedure should be applied, especially in patients with risk recognized factors.
TI  - Coronal microleakage assessed by polymicrobial markers.
AB  - Studies have shown significant bacterial leakage following exposure of sealed root canals to artificial and natural saliva. The objective of this study was to determine contamination via bacterial migration in artificial saliva in endodontically treated teeth using different obturation techniques and sealers. A total of 144 extracted, human mandibular anterior teeth were cleaned and shaped to a #40 master apical file using hand and rotary instrumentation. One hundred and twenty teeth were divided into two experimental groups. The teeth in Group 1 were obturated with gutta-percha using lateral compaction and five different sealers, and the teeth in Group 2 were obturated with gutta-percha using thermomechanical compaction and five different sealers. The remaining 24 teeth were prepared as positive and negative controls. All specimens, except the negative controls, were inoculated every five days with Anaerobic streptococci (NCTC 9891) related to Peptostreptococcus micros and Prevotella intermedia (ATCC 25611). The contamination onset time was continuously recorded and turbid broths cultured for bacteria identification. The controls behaved as expected. Regardless of the combination between obturation techniques and different sealers, all broths became turbid during this experiment. The correlation between the obturation techniques and the sealers revealed statistical significance using ANOVA (p<0.0001), followed by the Duncan Multiple Range Test, which determined the ranking between these interactions. The combination of MicroSeal obturation technique with Ketac-Endo sealer allowed a slower rate of coronal-apical bacterial migration.
TI  - Increased antimicrobial resistance in organisms recovered from otitis media with  effusion.
AB  - Previous studies concerning the microbiology of otitis media with effusion (OME)  did not correlate the past use of antimicrobial agents with the recovered organism's antimicrobial susceptibility. A retrospective analysis of cultures obtained from aspirates of 129 children with OME was performed. The study identified the isolated organisms and determined their susceptibility to the most recently administered antimicrobials. Bacterial growth was noted in 58 (45 per cent) patients. Aerobic organisms only were recovered in 37 aspirates (63 per cent of the culture-positive aspirates); anaerobic bacteria in seven (12 per cent); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 14 (24 per cent). A total of 92 bacterial isolates were recovered, accounting for 1.6 isolates per specimen (1.1 aerobes and 0.5 anaerobes). There were a total of 66 aerobic isolates, including Haemophilus influenzae non type-b (20 isolates), Streptococcus pneumoniae (17), and Staphylococcus spp. (seven). Twenty-six anaerobes were recovered, including Peptostreptococcus spp. and Prevotella spp. (eight each) and Propionibacterium acnes (four). Resistance to the antimicrobial used was found in 60 (65 per cent) isolates, recovered from 41 (71 per cent) of the patients. Of the 41 patients in whom resistance was detected, 37 (90 per cent) had been treated within three months of culture and four (10 per cent) had completed treatment more than three months before the cultures were taken (p < 0.01). The highest rate of recovery of resistant organisms was following trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (96 per cent), amoxycillin (71 per cent), and azithromycin (56 per cent). Of the patients treated with amoxycillin, H influenzae predominated. S pneumoniae was recovered from four of the seven (57 per cent) after trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, four of 14 (29 per cent) following amoxycillin, and three of 11 (27 per cent) after azithromycin. The data illustrate the relationship between resistance to the antimicrobials given to children and their recovery from the middle ear of patients with OME.
TI  - Additive antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide and chlorhexidine on common  endodontic bacterial pathogens.
AB  - It is an established procedure to use calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2] as a therapeutic component to achieve sterilization of infected root canals. Unfortunately, some bacterial species are relatively resistant to Ca(OH)2 and are therefore associated with treatment failures. The objective of this study was to identify combinations of substances that improve antimicrobial activity. Ca(OH)2 was used as a suspension or as a component of gutta-percha points. Efficacy of killing was compared for (a) Ca(OH)2 suspension alone; (b) zinc oxide (ZnO) points alone; (c) Ca(OH)2 suspension combined with ZnO points; (d) Ca(OH)2 suspension combined with ZnO/chlorhexidine points; and (e) Ca(OH)2 points combined with ZnO/chlorhexidine points. Common endodontopathogenic bacterial species (Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus intermedius) in pure cultures served as target organisms. In the in vitro assay, the antibacterial substances and approximately 10(7) colony forming units of test bacteria were co-incubated in diluted human serum under growth conditions appropriate for the single bacterial species. Samples were taken on days 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 of incubation and viable counts determined. Gram-negative bacteria were sufficiently killed by Ca(OH)2 alone. Combinations with other agents did not improve the killing kinetics. For the inactivation of the Gram-positive bacteria P. micros and S. intermedius, a combination of Ca(OH)2 and ZnO/chlorhexidine, killed the bacteria faster than Ca(OH)2 alone. For E. faecalis, combining Ca(OH)2 suspension with ZnO/chlorhexidine points lead to a faster decrease in the overall number of viable bacteria, but no test conditions lead to the complete loss of culture viability. The results of this study support the use of a combination of Ca(OH)2 and chlorhexidine for faster eradication of P. micros and S. intermedius from infected root canals.
TI  - Deep neck infection: a present-day complication. A retrospective review of 83 cases (1998-2001).
AB  - Deep neck infections are less and less frequent today than in the past. Nevertheless, their complications are often life-threatening. The present study reviews the experience of the Department of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery of Padua with deep neck infections during the period from 1998 to 2001. Eighty-three patients (55 males and 28 females) were retrospectively considered. The site of origin of deep neck infection was identified in 76 patients (91%). The most common cause was dental infection, occurring in 35 cases (42%). In 12 cases (14%) deep neck infection was a complication of oropharyngeal infection. The relatively high incidence of Peptostreptococcus sp, Streptococcus viridans, Streptococcus intermedius and constellatus isolation was consistent with the high rate of odontogenic cases. Surgery was advocated as the treatment for any infection of the deep neck spaces. The recent series has demonstrated that medical treatment did not seem to increase complication rates or mortality. Our tailored approach (medical or medical and surgical) based on clinical and radiological evidence was successful in 97% of the patients.
TI  - [Early diagnosis of bacterial brain abscesses: interest of diffusion-weighted MRI].
AB  - Three cases of bacterial brain abscesses, in immunocompetent patients, are reported. In all these cases, the diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MRI) with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map has permitted an early diagnosis and a rapid treatment. This emergency MRI showed in the three cases a low signal on TI-weighted images, a high signal on T2-weighted and echo-planar images, and a decrease of ADC (0.36- 0.49 x 10(-3) mm2/s). So, this new MRI technique provides an available and rapid element in the brain abscess diagnosis which often remains a complex clinical and radiological diagnosis.
TI  - Immunoglobulin-binding domains: Protein L from Peptostreptococcus magnus.
AB  - Protein L is a multidomain cell-wall protein isolated from Peptostreptococcus magnus. It belongs to a group of proteins that contain repeated domains that are able to bind to Igs without stimulating an immune response, the most characterized of this group being Protein A ( Staphylococcus aureus ) and Protein G ( Streptococcus ). Both of these proteins bind predominantly to the interface of C(H)2-C(H)3 heavy chains, while Protein L binds exclusively to the V(L) domain of the kappa -chain. The function of these proteins in vivo is not clear but it is thought that they enable the bacteria to evade the host's immune system. Two binding sites for kappa -chain on a single Ig-binding domain from Protein L have recently been reported and we give evidence that one site has a 25-55-fold higher affinity for kappa -chain than the second site.
TI  - [Utility of anaerobic blood cultures in extra-hospitalary bacteremias].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the rentability of anaerobic hemocultures with aerobic cultures in patients suffering bacteremia, trying to analyze the rentability of anaerobic cultures. METHODS: There were analyzed all the hemocultures taken by medical decision for one month. There were taken three extractions by patient in different venopunctures points. In each extraction was taken 10 ml (5 ml in aerobic bottle, and 5 ml in anaerobic bottle). There were compared microorganism isolated in aerobic bottles and anaerobic bottles. Three physician analyzed all the clinical dates of the patients with positive hemocultures and classified them as negatives, contaminants and significant. RESULTS: There were taken hemocultures of 180 patients. There were analyzed 152 hemocultures groups (3 extractions aerobic-anaerobic), without studying 28 owe to not following the study protocol 24 (13.3%) or because of not possibility of studying clinical story 4 (2.2%). Aerobic extractions: Negatives 91 (59.86%), contaminants 36 (23.68%), significant with or without contaminant 25 (16.44%). Anaerobic extractions: Negatives 127 (83.5%), contaminants 2 (1.31%); significant with or without contaminant 23 (15.13%). There are 6 (8.6%) significant positive isolated in anaerobic bottles, that were negative in aerobic bottles, and are: 3 E. coli, 1 K. pneumoniae, 1 Peptostreptococcus sp, 1 Bacteroides sp, and over the total significant isolated (31) are the 19.35%. Both anaerobic bacteremias were clinically suspected. Contaminant microorganism more frequently isolated in aerobic bottles was Staphylococcus sp, 25 cases (69.44% of all contaminants). Significant microorganism more frequently isolated was E. coli (in anaerobic bottles too) in 12 cases (38.70%) of all significant isolated, following by Streptococcus pneumoniae with 4 cases (12.9%). CONCLUSIONS: We recommend collection of one aerobic and one anaerobic blood culture bottle per blood culture set because the global rentability of hemocultures is increased significantly.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Telithromycin is one of the ketolides, characterised by a 3-keto group instead of L-cladinose and a C(11)-C(12) carbamate link by an alkyl chain to a pyridinum and imidazolium ring side chain. We evaluated in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin against gynaecological pathogens. METHODS: In the vitro study, the antibacterial activity of telithromycin against 180 isolates (isolated in the year 2000) of Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 33), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 22), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (n = 30), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (n = 20), Finegoldia magna (n = 20), Bacteroides fragilis (n = 25) and Prevotella bivia (n = 30) was compared with that of erythromycin A, clarithromycin, azithromycin, ampicillin and levofloxacin. In the in vivo study, the efficacy of telithromycin was evaluated using experimental intra-abdominal abscesses in mice caused by B. fragilis (minimum inhibitory concentration of telithromycin 0.5 mg/l). RESULTS: In the in vitro study, telithromycin inhibited more than 50% of clinical isolates of S. agalactiae, E. faecalis, N. gonorrhoeae, P. anaerobius, F. magna, B. fragilis and P. bivia at concentrations of 0.016, 0.063, 0.063, 0.032, 0.032, 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. Telithromycin inhibited more than 90% of these clinical isolates at concentrations of 0.016, 4, 0.125, 0.063, 0.063, 4 and 1 mg/l, respectively. In the in vivo study, telithromycin inhibited abscess formation and significantly decreased viable cell counts in abscesses in comparison with the untreated group. CONCLUSIONS: These in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities suggest that telithromycin could be a potential candidate for the treatment of bacterial infections complicated by chlamydial infection.
TI  - Microbiology and management of acute suppurative thyroiditis in children.
AB  - This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of suppurative thyroiditis (ST). Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, are the predominant aerobic isolates. The most common anaerobic bacteria are Gram-negative bacilli and Peptostreptococcus spp. Agents that are rarely recovered include Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus viridans, Salmonella spp., Enterobacteriaceae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, atypical mycobacteria, Aspergillus spp., Coccidioides immitis, Candida spp., Treponema pallidum, and Echinococcus spp. Viruses have been associated with subacute thyroiditis, and include measles, mumps, influenza, enterovirus Epstein-barr, adenovirus, echovirus, and St Louis encephalitis. Therapy includes administration of antibiotics effective against the causative pathogen(s). Proper selection of therapy can be guided by culture of the lesion. Surgical drainage may be necessary in case of suppuration.
TI  - Differences in antimicrobial activity of four commercial 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthrinse formulations: an in vitro contact test and salivary bacterial counts study.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of four commercial 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthrinses. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The in vitro antimicrobial activity test consisted in a modified contact test where 20 selected bacterial species were tested during 1 min with each test product. After the contact, the inoculum was cultured, and the results were expressed in terms of survival/resistance and the percentage of survival as compared to a saline control. The in vivo test consisted of a double-blind, randomized, crossover salivary bacterial counts study. 10 volunteers rinsed during 1 min with each tested product. Saliva samples were obtained before rinsing, and after 5 min, and 1, 3, 5 and 7 h. These samples were cultured both aerobically and anaerobically. Percentages of survival, in regard to baseline, were calculated for each time point. Comparisons among products were tested using anova and selected paired t-test. RESULTS: The in vitro contact test showed no survival in any tested species with CHX+CPC, while three species (Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus mitis and Peptostreptococcus micros) were resistant to the other three products. CHX and CHX+NaF demonstrated additional resistant species (three and four species, respectively). The in vivo salivary bacterial counts test showed higher reductions of CHX+CPC and CHX+ALC in aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, lasting for 5 h. Significant differences were detected at multiple time points, when these two products were compared both with the control and the other tested products. CONCLUSION: Important differences in activity, among 0.12% CHX products, were detected by both in vitro and in vivo tests. The formulation with alcohol was more active than those without alcohol, excepting the formulation with CHX+CPC, in which the reformulation and addition of CPC not only compensate but rather increase the antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of self-etching primer-bonding systems.
AB  - Self-etching primers are now considered the new generation of dentin bonding systems that modify and incorporate the bacteria-containing smear layer into their bonding mechanism. The antibacterial effects of the self-etching primers Clearfil SE Bond, Mac Bond, Imperva FL Bond, One-Up BondF and Prompt L-Pop were evaluated using the bacteria Streptococcus mutans ATCC25175, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus catenaforme, Lactobacillus jensenii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Clostridium ramosum, Prevotella oris, Prevotella denticola and Fusobacterium nucleatum, with a disk diffusion method. A single-bottle total-etch dentin adhesive (Excite) was used for comparisons and chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as the positive control. After incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed. One-Up BondF, Prompt L-Pop and Excite showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. The bonding agents of Clearfil SE Bond, Mac Bond and Imperva FL Bond were unable to inhibit the growth of Lactobacillus jensenii and Actinomyces odontolyticus, while the primers of these systems produced inhibition halos to all tested microorganisms greater than that of chlorhexidine.
TI  - Microorganisms from canals of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions.
AB  - AIM: The objective of the present study was to identify the microbial flora within root canals of teeth with failed root-canal treatment and to determine the association of the various species with clinical features. METHODOLOGY: Sixty root-filled teeth with persisting periapical lesions were selected for this study. During nonsurgical endodontic re-treatment, the root-filling material was removed and the canals were sampled. Microbial sampling, isolation and species determination were performed using advanced microbiological techniques for anaerobic species. The association of microbiological findings with clinical features was investigated. RESULTS: Microorganisms were recovered from 51 teeth. In most cases, one or two strains per canal were found. Of the microbial species isolated, 57.4% were facultative anaerobic species and 83.3% Gram-positive microorganisms. Enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently recovered bacterial species. Obligate anaerobes accounted for 42.6% of the species and the most frequently isolated genera was Peptostreptococcus. which was associated with clinical symptoms (P < 0.01). Significant associations were also observed between: (a) pain or history of pain and polymicrobial infections or anaerobes (P < 0.05): (b) tenderness to percussion and Prevotella intermedia/P. nigrescens (P < 0.05); (c) sinus and Streptococcus spp. (P < 0.001) or Actinomyces spp. (P < 0.01); (d) coronally unsealed teeth and Streptococcus spp. or Candida spp. (both with P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The microbial flora in canals after failure of root-canal treatment were limited to a small number of predominantly Gram-positive microbial species. Facultative anaerobes, especially E. faecalis, were the most commonly isolated microorganisms, however, polymicrobial infections and obligate anaerobes were frequently found in canals of symptomatic root-filled teeth.
TI  - Bactericidal activities of methoxyfluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin  against aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens in serum.
AB  - Gatifloxacin (Bristol-Myers Squibb) and moxifloxacin (Bayer) are new methoxyfluoroquinolones with broad-spectrum activity against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens of the respiratory tract. In this investigation, we analyzed the bactericidal activity in serum over time of these antimicrobials against three aerobic (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus) and four anaerobic (Peptostreptococcus micros, Peptostreptococcus magnus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella melaninogenica) bacteria associated with respiratory tract infections. Serum samples were obtained from 11 healthy male subjects following a single 400-mg oral dose of gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin. These samples were collected prior to and at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h after the dose of each drug. Gatifloxacin exhibited bactericidal activity for a median of 12 h against Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC = 0.5 micro g/ml), Peptostreptococcus micros (MIC = 0.25 micro g/ml), and F. nucleatum (MIC = 0.5 micro g/ml) and 24 h against H. influenzae (MIC = 0.03 micro g/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC = 0.125 micro g/ml), Peptostreptococcus magnus (MIC = 0.125 micro g/ml), and Prevotella melaninogenica (MIC = 0.5 micro g/ml). Moxifloxacin exhibited bactericidal activity for a median of 24 h against Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC = 0.125 micro g/ml), H. influenzae (MIC = 0.015 micro g/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC = 0.06 micro g/ml), F. nucleatum (MIC = 0.5 micro g/ml), Prevotella melaninogenica (MIC =0.5 micro g/ml), Peptostreptococcus magnus (MIC = 0.125 micro g/ml), and Peptostreptococcus micros (MIC = 0.25 micro g/ml). The results from this pharmacodynamic study suggest that these fluoroquinolones would have prolonged killing activity against these organisms in vivo and may have clinical utility in the treatment of mixed aerobic-anaerobic respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Evaluation of root canal microorganisms isolated from teeth with endodontic failure and their antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  - Studies of the microbiota from the canals of teeth with failure of endodontic therapy have revealed that it differs markedly from that of untreated necrotic dental pulps. This study aimed to evaluate the microbiota of 30 root-filled teeth with persisting periapical lesions and to test the antibiotic susceptibility of the most prevalent species. Microbial samples, isolation and speciation were done using advanced microbiologic techniques for anaerobic species. A total of 55 bacterial species were isolated, 80% were gram-positives and 58% facultative anaerobic microorganisms. The bacterial genera most frequently recovered were Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Peptostreptococcus and Actinomyces. Antibiotic sensitivity of Enterococcus faecalis and Peptostreptococcus spp. was accomplished with the E-test system. All species studied were susceptible to benzylpenicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin combined with clavulanate. However, 20% of the E.faecalis strains were resistant to erythromycin and 60% to azithromycin. It was concluded that microbial flora in canals after endodontic failure comprised predominantly facultative anaerobes and gram-positive species. E.faecalis was the species most frequently isolated and showed erythromycin and azithromycin resistance among the isolates.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime against clinical isolates in 2000 and 2001].
AB  - As the post-marketing surveillance of cefpodoxime proxetil (Banan), MICs of cefpodoxime (CPDX, an active form of Banan) against 1090 clinical isolates of 22 species from 15 medical institutions all over Japan from June 2000 to March 2001 were measured using the broth microdilution method approved by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and compared with those of oral cephem antibacterials, cefaclor, cefdinir, cefditoren, and cefcapene. In this study, remarkable change in the activity of CPDX was observed in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae compared with the susceptibility in the studies before Banan was launched. This cause is considered to be the increase in the incidence of the following resistant strains: penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (47.3%), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP, 15.1%), and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) H. influenzae (24.0%), which were scarcely isolated in 1989 when Banan was launched. Other tested drugs also exhibited low activity against these resistant strains. However, CPDX showed comparatively good activity with MIC90 of 2 micrograms/mL against PRSP. Against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, CPDX also showed comparatively good activity with MIC90 of < or = 4 micrograms/mL, which was almost equal to that in the studies before its marketing. Against quinolones-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, CPDX showed excellent activity with MIC90 of 0.5 microgram/mL. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae except for Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii, CPDX showed good activity. However, in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. Proteus spp., and Providencia spp., there are some high-resistant strains to all tested drugs including CPDX. Against Peptostreptococcus spp., MIC90 of CPDX was 8 micrograms/mL and its MIC range was widely distributed from 0.03 to 32 micrograms/mL, which were similar to those in the studies before its marketing. In this study, CPDX showed the decrease in the activity against several species as did other drugs tested, but against most of species tested, CPDX maintained good activity. Furthermore, it is necessary to pay much attention to the trend of resistant strains.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between April 1999 and March 2000].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in Japan since July 1982. In this paper, the results obtained in the academic year 1999 (from April 1999 to March 2000) have been summarized. Two hundred seven cases were investigated, and 411 strains were isolated from 169 cases (81.6%). Of those strains, 184 and 227 strains were from primary infections and postoperative infections, respectively. In primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes, Streptococcus spp., and Escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of Gram-positive aerobes were higher than in primary infections. Staphylococcus aureus were most frequently isolated among Gram-positive aerobes, Peptostreptococcus prevotii among Gram-positive anaerobes, E. coli among Gram-negative aerobes, and Bacteroides fragilis among Gram-negative anaerobes. In primary infections, the percentage of Gram-negative aerobes, which gradually increased by the year 1998, decreased in the year 1999. The percentage of Gram-negative anaerobes increased, while that of Gram-negative bacteria was equivalent to that in the last year. In postoperative infections, the percentage of Gram-negative anaerobes, which continuously increased after the year 1990, decreased, while that of Gram-positive aerobes, which decreased in the last year, increased. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus accounted for 70.7% of S. aureus (41 strains). Either the number of strain or the percentage of MRSA decreased. The susceptibilities of E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae decreased against third and forth generation cephems, oxacephems, and monobactams. The susceptibilities of P. aeruginosa to carbapenems tend to decrease after the year 1997. S. aureus showed good susceptibilities to the tested drugs including arbekacin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin.
TI  - Effects of selected immunouppressive drugs on prostaglandin release, protein synthesis and cell proliferation in human gingival fibroblasts and on the growth of plaque bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Immunosuppressants play an essential role in transplantation therapy. In view of the side effects, e.g. gingival overgrowth, the present in vitro study was performed in order to investigate the effect of selected immunosuppressants on metabolic activities of gingival fibroblasts. Furthermore, the effect on the growth of six oral microorganisms was investigated. METHODS: Human gingival fibroblasts were incubated in the presence of azathioprine (Aza), cyclosporin A (CsA), tacrolimus (Tac) or mycophenolatmofetil (Myc). PGE subset 2 release was determined by means of a specific competitive enzyme immunoassay, using monoclonal antibodies specific for PGE subset 2 (clone E2R1). The protein content was measured spectrophotometrically. A redox indicator system was employed to assess the proliferation activity. In an additional trial the growth of six strains of oral bacteria (A. viscosus T14V, S. oralis H1, S. mutans 10449, C. gingivalis DR2001, A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4, and M. micros 33270) in the presence of the immunosuppressants was measured. RESULTS: In comparison with the controls, the PGE subset 2 release was increased by 39.3% following incubation with Aza, and by 77.0% with CsA. The protein concentrations (1 g immunosuppressant / ml medium) were reduced by 26.0% for Aza and 17.0% for Myc. Furthermore, a drug-dependent inhibition in the cell proliferation rate was noted after an incubation period of 6 hours (Aza 70.7%, CsA 78.2%, Myc 69.8%, Tac 64.0%). The most pronounced growth-inhibiting effects were observed for CsA at values ranging from 21.0% (S. mutans 10449) to 48.6% (A. viscosus T14V) growth inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: The present study with common immunsuppresants demonstrated both a medication- and dose-dependent alteration in the metabolic activity of gingival fibroblasts. Furthermore, growth-inhibitory effects on the selected bacterial strains could be observed.
TI  - Vaginal bacterial flora activates rat peritoneal mast cells.
AB  - Sixteen strains of physiological and pathological vaginal bacteria were tested for their ability to secrete histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells in vitro. We noticed that Mycoplasma hominis-induced histamine release was very high (up to 53.6%). The stimulation of rat mast cells with Staphylococccus cohnii, Staphylococcus coagulase(-) (two strains), Ureaplasma urealyticum, Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides capillosus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae resulted in lower but significant histamine secretion (11.2%-17.5%). Other bacteria strains (Staphylococcus epidermidids, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Actinomyces naeslundii (two strains) and Lactobacillus fermentum (two strains) caused very low (4.2% - 8.8%) histamine release.
TI  - Acute bacterial suppurative parotitis: microbiology and management.
AB  - The parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. The most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial parotitis are Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. The predominant anaerobes include gram-negative bacilli (including pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp.), Fusobacterium spp., and Peptostreptococcus spp. Streptococcus spp. (including S. pneumoniae) and gram-negative bacilli (including Escherichia coli) have also been reported. Gram-negative organisms are often seen in hospitalized patients. Organisms less frequently found are Arachnia, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Treponema pallidum, cat-scratch bacillus, and Eikenella corrodens. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of parotitis. Therapy includes maintenance of hydration and administration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy. Once an abscess has formed surgical drainage is required. The choice of antimicrobial depends on the etiologic agent. Maintenance of good oral hygiene, adequate hydration, and early and proper therapy of bacterial infection of the oropharynx may reduce the occurrence of suppurative parotitis.
TI  - Identification of bacteria in acute endodontic infections and their antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to identify the bacterial composition of  the microbiota from acute endodontic abscesses/cellulitis and their antimicrobial susceptibilities. STUDY DESIGN: Purulence from 17 patients with acute endodontic abscesses/cellulitis was obtained by needle aspiration and processed under anaerobic conditions. Bacteria were isolated and identified by biochemical or molecular methods. The antimicrobial susceptibility of isolated bacteria was determined by using the Etest. RESULTS: All 17 aspirates contained a mix of microorganisms. A total of 127 strains of bacteria were isolated. Of 127 strains, 80 strains were anaerobes and 47 strains were aerobes. The mean number of strains per sample was 7.5 (range, 3 to 13). The average number of viable bacteria was 6.37 x 10(7) (range, 10(4) to 10(8)) colony-forming units/mL. Strict anaerobes and microaerophiles were the dominant bacteria in 82% (14 of 17) of the cases. The genera of bacteria most frequently encountered were Prevotella and Streptococcus. Prevotella and Peptostreptococcus were frequently found to dominate the mixture. The combination of Prevotella and Streptococcus was found in 53% (9 of 17). The previously reported uncultured Prevotella clone PUS9.180 was frequently identified. The percentage of bacteria susceptible/intermediate for each antibiotic in this study was penicillin V, 81% (95 of 118); metronidazole, 88% (51 of 58); amoxicillin, 85% (100 of 118); amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, 100% (118 of 118); and clindamycin, 89% (105 of 118). CONCLUSIONS: The present results confirm the existence of mixed infection with the predominance of anaerobic bacteria in acute endodontic abscesses/cellulitis. The frequency of uncultured Prevotella clone PUS9.180 suggests the possible key role of this Prevotella species in acute endodontic infections. Penicillin V still possesses antimicrobial activity against the majority of bacteria isolated from acute endodontic infections. However, if penicillin V therapy has failed to be effective, the combination of penicillin V with metronidazole or amoxicillin with clavulanic acid is recommended. Switching to clindamycin is another good alternative.
TI  - Bacteriology of acute and chronic sphenoid sinusitis.
AB  - Aspirates of 16 acutely infected and 7 chronically infected sphenoid sinuses were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 29 isolates were recovered from the 16 cases of acute sphenoid sinusitis (1.8 per specimen): 22 aerobic and facultative (1.4 per specimen), and 7 anaerobic (0.4 per specimen). Aerobic and facultative organisms alone were recovered in 10 specimens (62%), anaerobes alone were isolated in 3 (19%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were recovered in 3 (19%). The predominant aerobic and facultative species were Staphylococcus aureus (9 isolates), Streptococcus spp (9), and Haemophilus influenzae (2). A total of 28 isolates were recovered from the 7 cases of chronic sphenoid sinusitis (4.0 per specimen): 11 aerobic and facultative (1.6 per specimen) and 17 anaerobic (2.4 per specimen). Aerobic and facultative organisms alone were recovered in I instance (14%), anaerobes alone in 3 instances (43%), and mixed aerobes and anaerobes in 3 instances (43%). The predominant aerobic bacteria were gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 1 each). The predominant anaerobes included Peptostreptococcus spp (4 isolates), Prevotella spp (5), and Fusobacterium spp (4). These findings illustrate the unique microbiology of acute and chronic sphenoid sinusitis.
TI  - Prevalence of pathogens in diabetic foot infection in South Indian type 2 diabetic patients.
AB  - AIM: To determine the prevalence of pathogens in diabetic foot infections, in relation to parameters like Wagner's grading, duration of diabetes and healing time. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A group of 654 (M:F, 433:221) type 2 diabetic patients with foot ulcers were studied. Specimens like pus, wound exudate and tissue were processed for smear for Gram's staining, aerobic and anaerobic culture, and biochemical identifications. RESULTS: In 654 diabetic patients, 728 pathogens were isolated. Aerobic pathogens were isolated in 437 (66.8%) patients and anaerobic pathogens were isolated in 217 (33.2%). As Wagner's grading increased, the prevalence of anaerobic pathogens also increased. Neuropathy was common in diabetic patients infected with both aerobic and anaerobic pathogens. Ulcers infected with anaerobic pathogens showed a longer healing time than ulcers infected with aerobic pathogens. There was no significant difference in peripheral vascular disease (PVD) in patients selected for the study. Among aerobic pathogens, Enterobacteriaceae family (48%), Staphylococcus species (spp) (18.2%), Streptococcus spp (16.8%) and Pseudomonas spp (17%) were seen frequently. Among anaerobes Peptostreptococcus spp and Clostridium spp formed 69.4%. Gram-negative anaerobes like Bacteroides spp and Fusobacterium spp were present in 30.6%. Healing time was longer when strict aerobic pathogen Pseudomonas spp and strict anaerobic pathogens were present (136.1 +/- 28.6 and 136.4 +/- 34.7 days, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic foot infection is polymicrobial in nature. The healing time of wound infected with anaerobic pathogens was higher than those infected with aerobic pathogens. Anaerobic pathogens increased with the Wagner's grading. Presence of neuropathy increased the risk of foot infection.
TI  - A study on the isolation of anaerobic bacteria from the root canal infections in  anterior non-vital teeth with special reference to Bacteroides species.
AB  
TI  - Joint and bone infections due to anaerobic bacteria in children.
AB  - The current review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis due to anaerobic bacteria in children. Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae type-b, and Group A streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Kingela kingae, Neisseria meningiditis and Salmonella spp are the predominant aerobic bacteria that cause arthritis in children. Gonococcal arthritis can occur in sexually active adolescents. The predominant aerobes causing osteomyelitis in children are S. aureus, H. influenzae type-b, Gram-negative enteric bacteria, beta-hemolytic streptococci, S. pneumoniae, K. kingae, Bartonella henselae and Borrelia burgdorferi. Anaerobes have rarely been reported as a cause of these infections in children. The main anaerobes in arthritis include anaerobic Gram negative bacilli including Bacteroides fragilis group, Fusobacterium spp., Clostridium spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. Most of the cases of anaerobic arthritis, in contrast to anaerobic osteomyelitis, involved a single isolate. Most of the cases of anaerobic arthritis are secondary to hematogenous spread. Many patients with osteomyelitis due to anaerobic bacteria have evidence of anaerobic infection elsewhere in the body, which is the source of the organisms involved in osteomyelitis. Treatment of arthritis and osteomyelitis involving anaerobic bacteria includes symptomatic therapy, immobilization in some cases, adequate drainage of purulent material and antibiotic therapy effective to these organisms.
TI  - Sequence variations within protein families are linearly related to structural variations.
AB  - It is commonly believed that similarities between the sequences of two proteins infer similarities between their structures. Sequence alignments reliably recognize pairs of protein of similar structures provided that the percentage sequence identity between their two sequences is sufficiently high. This distinction, however, is statistically less reliable when the percentage sequence identity is lower than 30% and little is known then about the detailed relationship between the two measures of similarity. Here, we investigate the inverse correlation between structural similarity and sequence similarity on 12 protein structure families. We define the structure similarity between two proteins as the cRMS distance between their structures. The sequence similarity for a pair of proteins is measured as the mean distance between the sequences in the subsets of sequence space compatible with their structures. We obtain an approximation of the sequence space compatible with a protein by designing a collection of protein sequences both stable and specific to the structure of that protein. Using these measures of sequence and structure similarities, we find that structural changes within a protein family are linearly related to changes in sequence similarity.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of major pathogens of orofacial odontogenic infections to 11 beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - In this study, we evaluated the current effectiveness of 11 beta-lactam antibiotics for treatment of orofacial odontogenic infections by determining the antimicrobial susceptibility of the major pathogens. The antimicrobial susceptibilities of viridans streptococci (n = 47), Peptostreptococcus (n = 67), Porphyromonas (n = 18), Fusobacterium (n = 57), black-pigmented Prevotella (n = 59) and non-pigmented Prevotella (n = 47) isolated from pus specimens of 93 orofacial odontogenic infections to penicillin G, cefmetazole, flomoxef, cefoperazone, cefoperazone/sulbactam, ceftazidime, cefpirome, cefepime, cefoselis, imipenem and faropenem were determined using the agar dilution method. Penicillin G, most cephalosporins, imipenem and faropenem worked well against viridans streptococci, Peptostreptococcus, Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium. Penicillin G and most cephalosporins, including fourth-generation agents, were not effective against beta-lactamase-positive Prevotella, though they were effective against beta-lactamase-negative strains. Cefmetazole, cefoperazone/sulbactam, imipenem and faropenem expressed powerful antimicrobial activity against beta-lactamase-positive Prevotella. In conclusion, penicillins have the potential to be first-line agents in the treatment of orofacial odontogenic infections. Most of the other beta-lactam antibiotics, including fourth-generation cephalosporins, were not found to have greater effectiveness than penicillins. In contrast, cefmetazole, cefoperazone/sulbactam, imipenem and faropenem were found to have greater effectiveness than penicillins.
TI  - Randomized, double-blind, multicenter comparison of oral cefditoren 200 or 400 mg BID with either cefuroxime 250 mg BID or cefadroxil 500 mg BID for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections are commonly observed in medical practice. Because these infections typically are confined to the superficial layers and seldom lead to the destruction of skin structures and resultant systemic dissemination, in general they can be treated with an oral antibiotic with potent microbiologic activity against gram-positive pathogens. OBJECTIVE: This paper compares the efficacy and tolerability of 3 beta-lactam antibiotics in patients with uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections. METHODS: Two double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group studies were conducted, in which patients aged > or = 12 years with uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections were randomized to receive cefditoren 200 or 400 mg, cefuroxime 250 mg, or cefadroxil 500 mg, each BID for 10 days. Study 1 compared cefditoren with cefuroxime; Study 2 compared cefditoren with cefadroxil. Clinical and microbiologic responses were assessed at a posttreatment visit (within 48 hours of treatment completion) and test-of-cure visit (7-14 days after treatment completion). Patients were monitored closely throughout the study with the use of physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, and assessment of adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 1,685 patients (855 males, 830 females; mean age, 41.1 years [range, 12-95 years]) were enrolled. Within both studies, the 3 treatment groups were similar at baseline based on demographic characteristics and types of infection. Cellulitis (26%), wound infection (25%), and simple abscess (15%) were the most common infections. Clinical cure rates at the test-of-cure visit were 85% (443/523) for cefditoren 200 mg, 83% (427/516) for cefditoren 400 mg, 88% (234/265) for cefuroxime, and 85% (211/248) for cefadroxil. At the test-of-cure visit, cefditoren 200 mg had eradicated significantly fewer of the causative pathogens isolated before treatment in microbiologically evaluable patients than did cefuroxime in Study 1 (P = 0.043) but significantly more of the pathogens than did cefadroxil in Study 2 (P = 0.018). Eradication rates for the most commonly isolated pathogens were generally similar in the 3 treatment groups in both studies, with the only significant difference favoring cefditoren 200 and 400 mg over cefadroxil for Peptostreptococcus species in Study 2 (P = 0.016 and P = 0.003, respectively). A minority of patients (< or = 5% in any treatment group) discontinued study-drug treatment prematurely due to a treatment-related adverse event, with statistically higher rates for cefditoren 400 mg than for cefditoren 200 mg and the comparator cephalosporins (each P < 0.05). All 3 cephalosporins were generally well tolerated. Most adverse events (>93%) were categorized as mild to moderate, with the most common being diarrhea, nausea, and headache. CONCLUSION: In this population of patients with uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections, including those due to Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, the clinical cure rate and tolerability of cefditoren were comparable to those of cefuroxime and cefadroxil.
TI  - Cutaneous and subcutaneous infections in newborns due to anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - This review describes the microbiology and management of the major cutaneous and  subcutaneous infections in newborns where anaerobic bacteria predominate: omphalitis, necrotizing fasciitis, breast abscess, and scalp infection following intrauterine fetal monitoring. The predominant bacteria known to cause these infections are group B streptococcus, group D enterococcus, group A streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, and anaerobic bacteria. All of these agents can colonize or infect the mother and subsequently colonize or infect the fetus or newborn either intrauterinely or during the passage through the birth canal. Infections due to anaerobes are often polymicrobial, and include also aerobic and facultative bacteria. The anaerobes recovered from these infections are Bacteroided fragilis group, Fusobacterium spp., Peptostreptococcus spp. and Clostridium spp. Early recognition and effective medical and surgical therapy are essential to recovery. Managements of these infections include surgical debridement and drainage when appropriate as well as topical and systemic use of antimicrobial agents effective against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Bacterial superinfection in human tungiasis.
AB  - Tungiasis is caused by penetration of the female sand flea Tunga penetrans into the epidermis of its host. It is endemic in many countries in Latin America, the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa. Although superinfection is a common clinical observation, the frequency and the pattern of bacterial pathogens associated with tungiasis have never been investigated systematically. We conducted a prospective clinico-bacteriological study with patients living in a shantytown in Fortaleza, capital of Ceara State (Northeast Brazil), where tungiasis is hyperendemic. Swabs were taken from 78 patients with multiple lesions after surgical extraction of the parasite, and the specimens were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. Ninety-nine specimens were investigated for aerobic bacteria, from which 146 pathogens were identified. The most common species were Staphyloccous aureus (35.5%) and various enterobacteriaceae (29.5%). Bacillus sp., Enteroccous faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Pseudomonas sp. were also isolated. Eighty-four anaerobic cultures yielded 20 pathogens: in eight cases we detected Peptostreptococcus sp., in seven cases Clostridium sp., and in five cases non-identifiable gram-negative bacilli. These results show that secondary infection is very common in tungiasis, and caused by a variety of highly pathogenic microorganisms. It is proposed that T. penetrans acts as a foreign body facilitating biofilm formation within the epidermis. To prevent spreading of pathogens to the surrounding tissue and/or the systemic circulation, sand fleas should be surgically extracted immediately after penetration.
TI  - Invasion of dentinal tubules by oral bacteria.
AB  - Bacterial invasion of dentinal tubules commonly occurs when dentin is exposed following a breach in the integrity of the overlying enamel or cementum. Bacterial products diffuse through the dentinal tubule toward the pulp and evoke inflammatory changes in the pulpo-dentin complex. These may eliminate the bacterial insult and block the route of infection. Unchecked, invasion results in pulpitis and pulp necrosis, infection of the root canal system, and periapical disease. While several hundred bacterial species are known to inhabit the oral cavity, a relatively small and select group of bacteria is involved in the invasion of dentinal tubules and subsequent infection of the root canal space. Gram-positive organisms dominate the tubule microflora in both carious and non-carious dentin. The relatively high numbers of obligate anaerobes present-such as Eubacterium spp., Propionibacterium spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Peptostreptococcus micros, and Veillonella spp.-suggest that the environment favors growth of these bacteria. Gram-negative obligate anaerobic rods, e.g., Porphyromonas spp., are less frequently recovered. Streptococci are among the most commonly identified bacteria that invade dentin. Recent evidence suggests that streptococci may recognize components present within dentinal tubules, such as collagen type I, which stimulate bacterial adhesion and intra-tubular growth. Specific interactions of other oral bacteria with invading streptococci may then facilitate the invasion of dentin by select bacterial groupings. An understanding the mechanisms involved in dentinal tubule invasion by bacteria should allow for the development of new control strategies, such as inhibitory compounds incorporated into oral health care products or dental materials, which would assist in the practice of endodontics.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. Fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 127), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; n = 123), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), Enterococcus faecium (n = 50), Enterococcus avium (n = 50), and Peptostreptococcus spp. (P. anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. magnus, P. micros, P. prevotii; n = 125). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR, CFPM, FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. The decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual MIC range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.
TI  - [Clinical aspects of abscess development in parotitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper was to analyse parotideal abscesses on the basis of a larger number of patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The data of 36 patients (mean age 44 years) with a parotideal abscess was analysed. RESULTS: Ultrasound scan was always necessary to verify the diagnosis. The surgical drainage was done under myoelectric monitoring of the facial nerve. Only in 1 patient a temporary minor paralysis of the mandibular branch was noticed. The most common bacteria were Staph. aureus, Streptococcus, and Peptostreptococcus. In 2 cases a tuberculosis and in 2 children an atypical mycobacterial infection was discovered. In another patient a metastasis of a squamous cell carcinoma was found. CONCLUSIONS: In every patient with an acute swelling of the parotid region without consideration of age, number of leucocytes or a typical fluctuation, an ultrasound scan should be used. The surgical drainage of the abscess should be done under myoelectric monitoring (Cave: muscle relaxant). In every case, a specimen for microbiological analysis (bacterial determination) and a biopsy (to exclude malignoma or atypical mycobacteria) are necessary. A peri- and post-operative therapy with a combination of aminopenicillin and clavulanic acid or with cephalosporine is recommended.
TI  - Mice lacking monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 have enhanced susceptibility to an interstitial polymicrobial infection due to impaired monocyte recruitment.
AB  - Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) is an important chemokine that induces monocyte recruitment in a number of different pathologies, including infection. To investigate the role of MCP-1 in protecting a host from a chronic interstitial polymicrobial infection, dental pulps of MCP-1(-/-) mice and controls were inoculated with six different oral pathogens. In this model the recruitment of leukocytes and the impact of a genetic deletion on the susceptibility to infection can be accurately assessed by measuring the progression of soft tissue necrosis and osteolytic lesion formation. The absence of MCP-1 significantly impaired the recruitment of monocytes, which at later time points was threefold higher in the wild-type mice than in MCP-1(-/-) mice (P < 0.05). The consequence was significantly enhanced rates of soft tissue necrosis and bone resorption (P < 0.05). We also determined that the MCP-1(-/-) mice were able to recruit polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) to a similar or greater extent as controls and to produce equivalent levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis-specific total immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgG1. These results point to the importance of MCP-1 expression and monocyte recruitment in antibacterial defense and demonstrate that antibacterial defense is not due to an indirect effect on PMN recruitment or modulation of the adaptive immune response.
TI  - Parotid salivary S-IgA antibodies during experimental gingivitis in smokers and non-smokers.
AB  - Persons who smoke display a less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the  experimental gingivitis model as compared with non-smokers. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether this could partly be explained by differences in levels of parotid total secretory IgA (S-IgA) or parotid S-IgA reactive with selected oral microorganisms. Parotid saliva samples were obtained from 11 smoking and 14 non-smoking volunteers, at baseline, after 5 and 14 days of full mouth experimental gingivitis. Output levels of total S-IgA and of specific S-IgA reactive with cell extracts from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Actinomyces naeslundii, Campylobacter rectus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Peptostreptococcus micros, Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus mutans were determined in the samples by means of ELISA. Smokers and non-smokers were found to have similar output levels (microg/min) of total S-IgA, and the values did not significantly change during the experimental gingivitis trial. Parotid salivary outputs (units/min) of the bacteria-specific S-IgA at baseline and at days 5 and 14, were not different between smokers and non-smokers; no changes were observed during the experimental gingivitis trial. The present observations indicate that total S-IgA and bacteria-specific S-IgA in saliva are not main factors that can explain the less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the experimental gingivitis model in smokers as compared with non-smokers.
TI  - The effects of an immediately pre-surgical chlorhexidine oral rinse on the bacterial contaminants of bone debris collected during dental implant surgery.
AB  - Dental implant surgery produces bone debris that can be used in the "simultaneous augmentation" technique. Although this debris is contaminated with oral bacteria, a stringent aspiration protocol has been shown to reduce the levels of contamination. Chlorhexidine mouthrinse is a well-proven antibacterial rinse that has been shown to reduce infectious complications associated with dental implants. This study examined the effect of pre-operative rinsing with a 0.1% chlorhexidine digluconate mouthrinse on the bacterial contaminants present in collected bone debris bone (CBD). Twenty partially edentate patients were randomly allocated into equal groups and underwent bone collection using the Frios Bone Collector (FBC) during the insertion of two dental implants. In group T a pre-operative chlorhexidine rinse was used, whilst in group C sterile water was used. For both groups, a stringent bone collection protocol was used. Bone samples were immediately transported for microbial analysis. Colonial and microscopic morphology, gaseous requirements and identification kits were utilised for identification of the isolated microbes. Thirty-nine species were identified including a number associated with disease, in particular Actinomyces odontolyticus, Clostridium bifermentans, Prevotella intermedia, and Propionibacterium propionicum. Samples from group T (chlorhexidine mouthrinse) yielded significantly fewer organisms (P < 0.001) than in group C (sterile water mouthrinse). Gram-positive cocci dominated the isolates from both groups. It is concluded that if bone debris is to be used for the purpose of immediate simultaneous augmentation, a preoperative chlorhexidine mouthrinse should be utilised in conjunction with a stringent aspiration protocol to reduce further the bacterial contamination of CBD.
TI  - Bacteriology of acute and chronic frontal sinusitis.
AB  - Aspirates of 15 acutely and 13 chronically infected frontal sinuses were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 20 isolates (1.3 per specimen) were recovered from the 15 cases of acute frontal sinusitis, 16 aerobic and facultative isolates (1.1 per specimen) and 4 anaerobic isolates (0.3 per specimen). Aerobic and facultative organisms alone were recovered in 13 specimens (87%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were recovered in 2 (13%). The predominant aerobic and facultative organisms were Haemophilus influenzae (6), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), and Moraxella catarrhalis (3). A total of 32 isolates were recovered from the 13 cases (2.5 per patient) of chronic frontal sinusitis, 12 aerobic and facultative isolates (0.9 per specimen) and 20 anaerobic isolates (1.5 per specimen). Aerobic and facultative organisms only were recovered in 3 instances (23%), anaerobes only in 7 instances (54%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 3 instances (23%). The predominant aerobic bacteria were gram-negative bacilli (H influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The predominant anaerobes included Prevotella species (8), Peptostreptococcus species (6), and Fusobacterium species (4). These findings illustrate the microbiologic features of acute and chronic frontal sinusitis.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial sensitivity for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (1,913 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 178), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; n = 199), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE; n = 98), methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE; n = 164), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 72), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (n = 28), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 206), Enterococcus faecium (n = 91), Enterococcus avium (n = 72), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 133), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 138), penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP; n = 133), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP; n = 100), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP; n = 29), Streptococcus milleri group (n = 135) and Peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 137). CZOP possessed comparable antibacterial activities against MSSA and MSSE to other cephems, and was also effective on MRSE but not on MRSA. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than other cephems. CZOP, however, did not indicate an antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus, just like other cephems. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to cefpirome (CPR) and higher than other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, just like other drugs. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as that of cefotiam (CTM), cefepime (CFPM) and CPR, and that against S. agalactiae was also preferable. CZOP and other cephems also had a preferable antibacterial activity against S. milleri group that was most sensitive to benzylpenicillin. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than that of cefazolin, CTM and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated with breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 96.5% in MRSA, 93.1% in PRSP, 60.0% in PISP, 40.3% in S. haemolyticus, 22.3% in E. faecalis, and 15.9% in MRSE. Those resistance ratios were similar to those for CFPM, but E. faecalis showed 90.8% resistance for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against this species. In conclusion, no remarkable annual change in the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria was observed. The sensitivities of PISP and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested to be decreasing.
TI  - Bacteriology and antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive cocci isolated from pus specimens of orofacial odontogenic infections.
AB  - We recently reported the beta-lactamase production and antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic gram-negative rods isolated from pus specimens of 93 orofacial odontogenic infections. In this report, we determine the bacteriology and antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria other than anaerobic gram-negative rods, mainly gram-positive cocci, isolated from the same specimens. Streptococcus constellatus and Peptostreptococcus micros were frequent isolates from all types of infection examined. Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Corynebacterium species, and Eubacterium species were recovered only from dentoalveolar infections, while Gemella morbillorum was found more frequently in periodontitis than in the other infections. beta-Lactamase-positive strains were detected only in staphylococci. Ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefazolin, cefotaxime, imipenem, erythromycin, clindamycin and levofloxacin showed high susceptibility rates (> or = 77%) against viridans streptococci, Peptostreptococcus and Gemella. Minocycline showed a high MIC90 value against viridans streptococci (32 microg/ml), and metronidazole was effective against Peptostreptococcus and Gemella. These results provide useful information for the treatment of orofacial odontogenic infections.
TI  - [Four cases of non-clostridial gas gangrene with diabetes mellitus].
AB  - We report four cases of non-clostridial gas gangrene. All cases were associated with diabetes mellitus as the underlying disease. Case 1: a 60-year-old male developed an ulcerative lesion on the dorsum of his left foot. Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Citrobacter freundii and Staphyrococcus epidermidis were identified in culture from odoriferous pus. Case 2: a 81-year-old female developed a lesion on her vulva spreading to the right lower abdomen. Bacteroides bivius, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus and Streptococcus faecalis were identified in culture of the odoriferous pus. Case 3: a 80-year-old male developed a swollen area with ulcer on the right foot. Bacteroides fragiris, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus avium and Enterococcus faecalis were identified by culture. Case 4: a 52-year-old female developed swelling of her left groin. Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus anginosus were identified in culture from the odoriferous pus. In all patients, a radiological examination revealed the presence of subcutaneous gas in the lesion. Prognosis of non-clostridial gas gangrene is usually poor. These four patients, however, all survived. Once an infectious sign is seen in the diabetic patient, it is important to discover a gas figure by using the radiological examination (plain film or computed tomography). Earlier diagnosis and debridement are the most important for a better prognosis. Because workers with diabetes mellitus are now increasing in number, occupational physicians should always keep in mind that a serious infectious disease like non-clostridial gas gangrene can develop even from minor accidental trauma, and they should control the working environment in the workplace where accidents often happen.
TI  - Bacterial meningoencephalomyelitis in dogs: a retrospective study of 23 cases (1990-1999).
AB  - The clinical records of 23 dogs (1990-1999) with histopathologically confirmed bacterial meningoencephalomyelitis were evaluated retrospectively. No breed, age, sex, or weight predisposition was found. All the dogs presented with clinical signs of a brain lesion, whereas 5 of 23 had neck pain. Pyrexia was detected in 11 of 23 dogs on admission. CBCs revealed neutrophilic leucocytosis in 7 of 21 dogs and thrombocytopenia in 3 of 21 dogs. The serum chemistry profiles were abnormal in 15 of 21 dogs. The results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis were abnormal in 13 of 14 dogs and aerobic CSF culture was positive for bacteria in 1of 8 samples. At postmortem examination, the lesions were localized to the central nervous system. Escherichia coli, Streptococcus, and Klebsiella spp were the most frequently isolated bacteria from cultures collected at postmortem examination. Twelve papers reporting 51 total clinical cases of canine bacterial meningoencephalomyelitis were reviewed. The clinical signs and results of the CBC, serum chemistry, blood culture, and CSF analysis were collated and compared with those of this study. The results of the CSF analysis in this study were similar to those in the literature. CSF cultures documented in the literature were positive for Staphylococcus, Pasteurella. Actinomyces, Nocardia spp, and various anaerobic species including Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium, and Bacteroides spp.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota of indigenous Indians of Central America.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define the subgingival microbial profiles of adult subjects from a  previously identified rural community of indigenous Indians in Guatemala, Central America. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A full-mouth periodontal examination was performed in 114 adult subjects from 45 families. Plaque samples were collected from both deep and shallow periodontal pockets and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization was employed to identify 17 species previously associated with periodontitis or health. RESULTS: Plaque deposits and gingivitis were universal and widespread, and periodontal pocketing > or =5 mm was highly prevalent (84% of subjects). Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 and Fusobacterium nucleatum were significantly more prevalent in shallow sites. At the subject level, Actinomyces naeslundii and Peptostreptococcus micros were significantly more prevalent in periodontally-healthy subjects. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any sample. CONCLUSION: There was no association between periodontal disease status and presence of suspected periodontal pathogens. These latter results conflict somewhat with those from treated populations. However, in this population where extensive plaque deposits and gingivitis are universal, the presence of putative pathogens may be more reflective of the local environment.
TI  - Differences in backbone dynamics of two homologous bacterial albumin-binding modules: implications for binding specificity and bacterial adaptation.
AB  - Proteins G and PAB are bacterial albumin-binding proteins expressed at the surface of group C and G streptococci and Peptostreptococcus magnus, respectively. Repeated albumin-binding domains, known as GA modules, are found in both proteins. The third GA module of protein G from the group G streptococcal strain G148 (G148-GA3) and the second GA module of protein PAB from P.magnus strain ALB8 (ALB8-GA) exhibit 59% sequence identity and both fold to form three-helix bundle structures that are very stable against thermal denaturation. ALB8-GA binds human serum albumin with higher affinity than G148-GA3, but G148-GA3 shows substantially broader albumin-binding specificity than ALB8-GA. The (15)N nuclear magnetic resonance spin relaxation measurements reported here, show that the two GA modules exhibit mobility on the picosecond-nanosecond time scale in directly corresponding regions (loops and termini). Most residues in G148-GA3 were seen to be involved in conformational exchange processes on the microsecond-millisecond time scale, whereas for ALB8-GA such motions were only identified for the beginning of helix 2 and its preceding loop. Furthermore, and more importantly, hydrogen-deuterium exchange and saturation transfer experiments reveal large differences between the two GA modules with respect to motions on the second-hour time scale. The high degree of similarity between the two GA modules with respect to sequence, structure and stability, and the observed differences in dynamics, binding affinity and binding specificity to different albumins, suggest a distinct correlation between dynamics, binding affinity and binding specificity. Finally, it is noteworthy in this context that the module G148-GA3, which has broad albumin-binding specificity, is expressed by group C and G streptococci known to infect all mammalian species, whereas P.magnus with the ALB8-GA module has been isolated only from humans.
TI  - Periodontal bacteria in rabbit mandibular and maxillary abscesses.
AB  - Despite the high incidence of odontogenic abscesses in pet rabbits, published data on the bacteriology of these infections are lacking, and clinical cultures are often ambiguous, making antibiotic choices difficult. In order to define the bacteriology of these infections, 12 rabbit mandibular and maxillary abscesses were cultured aerobically and anaerobically. All specimens yielded pathogenic bacteria, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella heparinolytica, Prevotella spp., Peptostreptococcus micros, Streptococcus milleri group, Actinomyces israelii, and Arcanobacterium haemolyticum. These organisms are consistent with the characterized bacteriology of periodontal disease in human and other mammalian studies. The isolates were tested against 10 antimicrobial agents commonly used to treat rabbits; 100% of the strains tested were susceptible to clindamycin, 96% were susceptible to penicillin and ceftriaxone, 54% were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, and only 7% were susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
TI  - [The microflora of ulzerous zone mucosa in patients with duodenal ulcer].
AB  - Bacteriological study of the biopsies taken from gastric and duodenal mucosa of 10 healthy volunteers and 74 patients with duodenal ulcer, was carried out. In the gastroduodenal zone of healthy subjects microorganisms of 6 genera (Streptococcus, Candida, Staphylococcus, Bacillus, Helicobacter and Lactobacillus) were detected. H. pylori was isolated in 20% of cases only in biopsy specimens taken from the antral section of the stomach of healthy as monoculture or in combination with C. albicans. In patients with duodenal ulcer activation of opportunistic microflora was observed in the periulcerous zone. More often H. pylori occurred in associations with fungi of the genus Candida, streptococci, staphylococci, enterobacteria, Pseudomonas and other microorganisms (of more than 30 genera). Quantitatively the dominating microorganisms (3.8-5.7 lg CFU/g) were H. pylori, fungi of the genus Candida, bacteria of the genera Streptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides, Gemella, Prevotella, Veillonella, Peptococcus, Bacillus, different species of opportunistic enterobacteria, as well as bacteria of the genera Staphylococcus, Micrococcus, Corynebacterium, Neisseria, Pseudomonas, etc. Opportunistic bacteria detected in the ulcerous zone, as a rule, expressed hemolytic, lecithinase, RNAase, caseinolytic, catalase and urease activity. Sonicated filtrates of such cultures produced a cytotoxic effect on cells HEp-2. Ulcer is an infected wound that needs sanitation.
TI  - [Retrospective analysis of Fusobacterium associated infections; experience at Aomori Prefectural Hospital with 108 cases from 1995 to 1999].
AB  - We experienced 108 cases of Fusobacterium associated infections, including otolaryngeal, oral, pleuropulmonary, intraabdominal, skin and soft tissue infections, at Aomori Prefectural Hospital during The 5 year-period from 1995 to 1999. A total of 433 organisms, included 113 Fusobacterium spp. (80 Fusobacterium nucleatum, 18 Fusobaterium necrophorum, 5 Fusobacterium varium, 4 Fusobacterium mortiferum, 6 Fusobacterium spp.), were recovered with an average of 4.0 organisms per case of the 108 cases, 68% were mixed aerobic and anaerobic and yielded 185 anaerobic bacteria (2.5 per case) and 137 aerobic bacteria (1.9 per case) with an average of 4.4 per case. The remaining 32% were purely anaerobic and yielded 111 organisms with an average of 3.2 per case, Prevotella spp., Bacteroides fragilis group, Streptococcus milleri group, Enterobacteriaceae, Peptostreptococcus spp. Staphylococcus spp. were most frequently coisolated with Fusobacterium spp.
TI  - In vitro antagonistic effect of Lactobacillus on organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess antagonistic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women as compared to the most common bacterial agents related to vaginosis. STUDY DESIGN: Antagonistic activity of different Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women not treated for infections with an antibiotic for the previous three months was screened using an agar slab method. The activity was tested against test organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis and/or urinary tract infections: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Prevotella bivia. RESULTS: Many of the 146 Lactobacillus strains tested exerted apparent antagonistic activities against gram-positive aerobic cocci and gram-negative rods, such as S aureus and E coli, and a marked number of Lactobacillus strains inhibited facultative bacteria, such as Gardnerella vaginalis and the anaerobes P anaerobius and P bivia. Only a few lactobacilli were able to inhibit growth of E faecalis and S agalactiae. Indicator bacteria growth inhibition probably relies upon several different complementary mechanisms. The specific indicator bacteria species determines which mechanism predominates. CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus strains taken from normal vaginal flora demonstrated antagonistic activity against a variety of bacteria related to vaginal and urinary tract infections. The specific occurrence rates of active Lactobacillus strains are different, and this difference is dependent on the indicator bacteria species.
TI  - Periapical lesion progression with controlled microbial inoculation in a type I diabetic mouse model.
AB  - Uncontrolled or poorly controlled diabetes mellitus may be a risk factor for the  development of large and/or debilitating periapical infections. The objectives of this investigation were to: (i) determine the effect of diabetes mellitus on the pathogenesis of periapical lesions with or without specific bacterial inoculations at the exposure sites, and (ii) test the sensitivities of two microbiological techniques in detecting the persistence of the bacterial inoculum in exposed pulps of nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. Periapical lesions were induced in first molars of 29 female NOD mice and 31 BALB/c controls. Acute (1-2 wk) or chronic (5 wk) exposures were either inoculated with a mixture of facultative and anaerobic bacteria or exposed to oral flora without inoculations. After death the teeth in the chronic groups were analyzed for the presence of the inoculated bacteria by culturing and by polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16S rDNA. Periapical lesion size was measured histomorphometrically and the interleukin-6 content was measured immunohistochemically. The mortality among NOD mice with inoculated and sealed exposures was 83%, compared with 29% for BALB/c mice. In the inoculated and uninoculated chronic NOD mice groups, 38% of the animals versus none of the BALB/c mice died. The chronic uninoculated NOD mice lost significantly more weight at the time of death than controls. Polymerase chain reaction was more sensitive than culturing in detecting the inoculated anaerobic bacteria. In the animals that survived to the predetermined time periods, lesion size and interleukin-6 content in NOD and BALB/c mice were not statistically different.
TI  - Ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  - Ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) 2 and 3. Ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with MIC90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Proteus spp., Clostridium perfringens, Fusobacterium spp. Peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic Streptococcus spp. Ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short PAE of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the Gram-positive strains but no PAE against Gram-negative strains. In an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. In comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. The protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. Cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. Given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. and Acinetobacter spp. For pathogens with a MIC of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated T > MIC will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a MIC of 1 mg/l 31%. For anaerobic bacteria with MIC values between 1-2 mg/l, the T > MIC may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. However, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between April 1998 and March 1999].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained in fiscal 1998 (from April 1998 to March 1999). The number of cases investigated as objectives was 225 for one year. A total of 429 strains (121 strains from primary infections and 308 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 183 cases (81.3% of total cases). In primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes and Escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of Gram-positive aerobes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. On the whole, among Gram-positive aerobes, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by Staphylococcus aureus with high frequency in isolation from postoperative infections. Among Gram-positive anaerobes, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were predominantly isolated. Among Gram-negative aerobes, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae were frequently isolated. Among Gram-negative anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates. In primary infections, the percentage of Gram-negative aerobes has gradually increased since fiscal 1995 or 1996 with these years as the turning point, while those of Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobes have gradually declined. In postoperative infections, the percentage of Gram-negative anaerobes has increased continuously since the mid-1980s. The percentage of MRSA among S. aureus rose to 89.7%, which was the highest level since the beginning of this study. The susceptibilities of B. fragilis, which did not show apparent changes, were recognized to have decreased against cephems in fiscal 1998. Among other bacteria in B. fragilis group, development of resistance to cephems has continued on a long-term basis since the mid-1980s. E. coli and K. pneuminiae have obviously not changed in susceptibilities, however, the susceptibilities of isolated strains in fiscal 1998 against high-generation cephems, oxacephems and monobactams have declined. We found neither vancomycin-resistant nor teicoplanin-resistant strains of S. aureus and Enterococcus spp.
TI  - Association of early onset periodontitis microbiota with aspartate aminotransferase activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the activity of the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) using the colorimetric PerioGard (PTM) test and the subgingival microflora in early onset periodontitis lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 25 otherwise healthy individuals exhibiting early onset periodontitis (EOP). In each patient four experimental sites were identified comprising one deep periodontal pocket (PD >5 mm) randomly chosen in each quadrant. Bacterial samples were obtained from the experimental sites, consecutively cultured anaerobically and in 10% CO(2) using selective and nonselective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. Clinical measurements as well as AST activity, assessed either as positive or negative using the PTM, were recorded at the same sites. RESULTS: Sixty-two sites exhibited AST positive and 38 AST negative activity. Analysis of bacterial counts using the ANOVA (Mann Whitney U-test) showed that Streptococcus intermedius, Peptostreptococcus micros, Campylobacter concisus, Bacteroides forsythus, Camplobacter gracilis, Campylobacter rectus and Selenomonas sputigena were significantly higher in sites with AST-positive activity. The odds ratio of having high prevalence of S. intermedius, P. micros, C. concisus, B. forsythus, C. gracilis, C. rectus and S. sputigena in the presence of a positive AST site was very high (range: 3.5-17.0). Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Gemella morbillorum, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Fusobacterium varium, Eubacterium lentum and Prevotella oralis were detected in significantly higher proportions in sites with AST negative activity and manifested a negative odds ratio in the presence of AST positive sites. The logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking and bleeding upon probing showed a significant association with AST activity, while plaque and suppuration were not found to be significant predictors of AST activity. The co-infection of Porphyromonas gingivalis, B. forsythus and P. micros, or P. gingivalis, B. forsythus and C. rectus were found to be significantly associated with the AST activity (p<0.001). AST positive sites revealed significantly higher occurrence of co-infections by P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, S. sputigena or by P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, S. intermedius than AST negative sites (p<0.001). P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, A. naeslundii co-infection was found significantly higher in the AST negative sites (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The present study found a high level of agreement between the presence of putative periodontal pathogens and positive AST scores at periodontal sites that clinically were considered to be potentially disease active. Prospective studies should be performed to confirm the findings.
TI  - Efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (II). Effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (Crest Complete) or power (Braun 3D Plaque Remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. METHODS: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. At baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. After random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. Clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. Significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the Quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: Mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. Streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while Streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. Mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. Major reductions occurred in both groups for A. naeslundii, A. israelii/gerencseriae, Peptostreptococcus micros, Veillonella parvula, Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, S. mitis/oralis/sanguis and S. constellatus/intermedius. All taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. The reductions in prevalence were greater for A. naeslundii, S. constellatus/intermedius, V. parvula, A. israelii/gerencseriae, S. mitis/oralis/sanguis, P. micros, Streptococcus mutans and P. intermedia/nigrescens. Mean prevalence was decreased more for Porphyromonas gingivalis, Campylobacter rectus/showae, Treponema denticola and Bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. CONCLUSIONS: The major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the subgingival microbiota. Counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. This reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. Further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem and 11 other antimicrobial agents against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from skin and soft tissue animal and human bite wound infections.
AB  - We studied the comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem, a new carbapenem, against 240 aerobic and 180 anaerobic recent clinical bite isolates using an agar dilution method and an inoculum of 10(4) cfu/spot for aerobes and 10(5) cfu/spot for anaerobes. Ertapenem inhibited 410/420 (98%) of the isolates tested at < or = 4 mg/L with only 4/5 Campylobacter gracilis and 1/3 Campylobacter rectus strains requiring . or = 16 mg/L for inhibition. Ertapenem was only moderately active (MIC 8 mg/L) against 4/6 Enterococcus faecalis and 1/11 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. All Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella septica, Pasteurella canis, Pasteurella dagmatis, Moraxella spp. and EF-4 isolates were inhibited at < or = 0.015 mg/L. MIC(90)s for other aerobic genera and species were as follows: Corynebacterium spp., 4 mg/L; Staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 mg/L; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 4 mg/L; other coagulasenegative staphylococci, 0.25 mg/L; Streptococcus milleri group, 0.5 mg/L; Eikenella corrodens, 0.03 mg/L; and Bergeyella zoohelcum, 0.5 mg/L. For anaerobes the range of MICs and MIC(90)s were: Prevotella ssp., < or = 0.015-0.5, 0.125 mg/L; Porphyromonas spp., < or = 0.015-0.03, 0.015 mg/L; Fusobacterium spp., 0.015-0.125, 0.03 mg/L; Bacteroides tectum, 0.03-0.125, 0.125 mg/L; and Peptostreptococcus spp., 0.01-2, 1 mg/L. Ertapenem showed excellent potency against the full range of animal and human bite wound pathogens.
TI  - [Comparative study of chromatography-mass spectrography of microorganism's chemical markers in blood and intestinal mucosa bioptats].
AB  - Fatty acids, that are microorganism's markers in blood and jejunum's, ileum's, and large intestine's bioptats of the patients with irritable bowel syndrome were investigated with gas chromatography. Markers of Cl. perfringens, Cl. difficile, Enterococcus, Streptomyces, Enterobacterial, Klebsiella, E. coli, Peptostreptococcus, Candida Albicans, genus of Streptococcus, of Staphylococcus, of Fusobacterium sp and others microorganisms were revealed. Settling of intestinal mucosa was the same in jejunum, ileum and large intestine (0.5-1.3) x 10(10) cells/gr. and was approximately the same as microorganism's concentration in feces (1.8 x 10(11) cells/gr). Correlation of blood and bioptats markers was demonstrated in the most patients. The possibility to use specific fatty blood acids as microorganisms markers in preliminary diagnosis of mucosa microflora changes is discussed.
TI  - Bacteriology of adenoids and tonsils in children with recurrent adenotonsillitis.
AB  - Adenoids and tonsils electively removed from 25 children with a history of recurrent group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) adenotonsillitis were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Two hundred twenty-four organisms (112 aerobes and facultatives, 110 anaerobes, and 2 Candida albicans) were isolated from the tonsils, and 229 (111 aerobes and facultatives and 118 anaerobes) were isolated from the adenoids. Mixed infection was present in all instances, with an average of 9.1 isolates per specimen. The predominant aerobes were Streptococcus sp, Haemophilus influenzae, and GABHS, and the prevalent anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella, and Fusobacterium spp. Beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were detected in 72 isolates recovered from 22 tonsils (88%) and in 74 isolates recovered from 21 adenoids (84%). Discrepancies in the organisms recovered were found between the tonsils and adenoids. Of the aerobic isolates, 20% were isolated only in tonsils and 18% only in adenoids. Of the anaerobes, 20% were found only in tonsils and 26% only in adenoids. This study demonstrates a polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora in both adenoids and tonsils, and discrepancies in recovery of pathogens such as GABHS. The adenoids may serve as a potential source of tonsillitis caused by GABHS.
TI  - Molecular identification of microorganisms from endodontic infections.
AB  - A relatively wide range of bacteria have been isolated from root canals using standard culture techniques. However, only 50% of the bacteria in the oral cavity are cultivable (S. S. Socransky et al., Arch. Oral Biol. 8:278-280, 1963); hence, bacterial diversity in endodontic infections is underestimated. This study used a PCR-based 16S rRNA gene assay, followed by cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons from a small subset of samples to assess the diversity of bacteria present in infected root canals. A total of 41 clinical samples from 15 de novo and 26 refractory cases of endodontic infections were assessed. Of these samples, 44% were positive by culture and 68% were positive by PCR. Eight samples were selected for further analysis. Of these, the two de novo cases yielded sequences related to those of the genera Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Propionibacterium, and Streptococcus and two clones were related to previously uncultivated bacteria, while the sinus-associated, de novo case yielded sequences related to those of the genera Lactobacillus, Pantoea, Prevotella, and Selenomonas. The five refractory cases produced clones which were related to the genera Capnocytophaga, Cytophaga, Dialister, Eubacterium, Fusobacterium, Gemella, Mogibacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella, Propionibacterium, Selenomonas, Solobacterium, Streptococcus, and Veillonella and two clones representing previously uncultivated bacteria. The phylogenetic positions of several clones associated with the Clostridiaceae and Sporomusa subgroups of the Firmicutes grouping are also shown. This study demonstrates that molecular techniques can detect the presence of bacteria in endodontic infections when culture techniques yield a negative result and can be used to identify a wider range of endodontic-infection-related bacteria including the presence of previously unidentified or unculturable bacteria.
TI  - An in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial efficacy of irrigants on biofilms of  root canal isolates.
AB  - AIM: The bactericidal effect of four antimicrobial agents was investigated against single-species biofilms derived from a range of root canal isolates. METHODOLOGY: Single-species biofilms of Prevotella intermedia, Peptostreptococcus micros, Streptococcus intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Enterococcus faecalis were generated on membrane filter discs and subjected to 15 min or 1 h incubation with 5 p.p.m. colloidal silver, 2.25% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), 0.2% chlorhexidine, 10% iodine or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) as a control. The antimicrobial activity of the agents was neutralized and the bacterial cells were harvested from the discs by vortexing, serially diluted in reduced transport fluid, plated on fastidious anaerobe agar containing 5% horse blood, incubated anaerobically and colony-forming units calculated. RESULTS: Iodine and NaOCl were more effective than chlorhexidine except against P. micros and P. intermedia where they were all 100% effective. Iodine and NaOCl elicited a 100% kill after 1 h incubation for all strains used. However, after 15 min, they showed differing bactericidal effects depending on the strain. None of the agents were effective against F. nucleatum after 15 min but NaOCl, iodine and chlorhexidine were all effective after 1 h. Colloidal silver was generally ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of a particular agent was dependent on the nature of the organism in the biofilm and on the contact time. NaOCl was generally the most effective agent tested, followed by iodine. However the clinical efficacy of these agents must be considered in light of the complex root canal anatomy and polymicrobial nature of root canal infections.
TI  - Bacteriology and beta-lactamase activity in acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the bacteriology of beta-lactamase (BL) enzyme activity in  sputum of 40 patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB). METHODS: The microbiology, BL production by the different isolates, and BL contents in the sputum were determined. RESULTS: Eighty-four isolates were recovered (2.1 isolates per specimen), 44 aerobic and facultative (1.1 isolates per specimen), and 40 anaerobic (1.0 isolate per specimen). Aerobic bacteria were recovered in only 9 (22.5%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria in 9 (22.5%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were found in 22 (55%). The predominant aerobic isolates were Streptococcus pneumoniae (15 isolates), Haemophilus influenzae (11), Moraxella catarrhalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4 each). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp. (19), Prevotella sp. (11), and Fusobacterium sp.(6). Mixed flora were present in 25 (62.5%) specimens, and the number of isolates varied from 2 to 5 per specimen. Thirty-nine beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (BLPB) were isolated in 33 (82.5%) of the 40 cases. The predominant aerobic BLPB were H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, K. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. The predominant anaerobic BLPB were Prevotella sp. and Fusobacterium sp. Beta-lactamase activity was detected in 26 (79%) of 33 of specimens in which BLPB were isolated, and in none of the seven specimens that did not harbor BLPB. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid detection of BL activity in sputum specimens may have implications for the antimicrobial management with AECB.
TI  - Computer-based redesign of a protein folding pathway.
AB  - A fundamental test of our current understanding of protein folding is to rationally redesign protein folding pathways. We use a computer-based design strategy to switch the folding pathway of protein G, which normally involves formation of the second, but not the first, beta-turn at the rate limiting step in folding. Backbone conformations and amino acid sequences that maximize the interaction density in the first beta-hairpin were identified, and two variants containing 11 amino acid replacements were found to be approximately 4 kcal mol-1 more stable than wild type protein G. Kinetic studies show that the redesigned proteins fold approximately 100 x faster than wild type protein and that the first beta-turn is formed and the second disrupted at the rate limiting step in folding.
TI  - Mutans streptococci in subgingival plaque of treated and untreated patients with  periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The etiology of root caries is thought to be identical to coronal caries, though root caries seem to be more complicated because of the higher susceptibility of exposed roots (dentin) by periodontal therapy to demineralization than intact enamel. This implies that mutans streptococci are the most likely pathogens in the development of root caries. Although it is known that both the numbers of mutans streptococci and the frequency of isolation in root caries lesions are negatively correlated with the distance from the gingival margin, the subgingival sulcus has not been considered a possible habitat for mutans streptococci. However, subgingival occurrence of mutans streptococci in both untreated and treated periodontal patients has not been documented well in the literature. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the presence and levels of mutans streptococci in the subgingival plaque of patients (n=154) in different stages of periodontal therapy. The subgingival sulcus may be a possible habitat for mutans streptococci. This localisation of mutans streptococci may be of importance in the development of root caries after periodontal surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, subgingival plaque samples from 154 consecutive adult periodontitis patients were tested for presence and levels of mutans streptococci and putative periodontal pathogens by anaerobic cultures. These patients were divided into 4 groups based on their stage of periodontal treatment: (1) untreated patients; (2) patients after initial periodontal therapy only; (3) patients in the maintenance phase who not underwent periodontal surgery; (4) patients after periodontal surgery. RESULTS: The prevalence of mutans streptococci in the 4 study groups varied from 82% in untreated patients to 94% in maintenance patients. The mean proportion of mutans streptococci was 6.65% in maintenance patients versus 1.86% in untreated patients (p=0.005) and 2.51% in patients after scaling and root planing (p=0.041). CONCLUSIONS: The subgingival area is a microbial habitat for mutans streptococci that may be of importance in the development of root caries in periodontitis patients.
TI  - Microbiological characteristics of subgingival microbiota in adult periodontitis, localized juvenile periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis subjects.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence of the cultivable subgingival microbiota in periodontal diseases and to draw attention to the polymicrobial nature of periodontic infections. METHODS: The study population consisted of 95 patients, 51 females and 44 males, aged 14-62 years. Twenty-nine patients exhibited adult periodontitis (AP), six localized juvenile periodontitis (LJP), and 60 rapidly progressive periodontitis (RPP). Two to four pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. Samples were collected with sterile paper points from the deepest periodontal pockets. The samples were cultured under anaerobic and microaerophilic conditions using selective and non-selective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and by a commercial rapid test system. RESULTS: Prevotella intermedia and Capnocytophaga spp. were the most frequently detected microorganisms in all diagnostic groups. Porphyromonas gingivalis and Peptostreptococcus micros were found more frequently in AP and RPP patients, while Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Eikenella corrodens were associated with AP, LJP and RPP patients. The other bacterial species, including Actinomyces spp., Streptococcus spp. and Eubacterium spp., were detected at different levels in the three disease groups. CONCLUSIONS: The data show the complexity of the subgingival microbiota associated with different periodontal disease groups, indicating that the detection frequency and levels of recovery of some periodontal pathogens are different in teeth affected by different forms of periodontal disease.
TI  - [Pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties of azithromycin (Zithromac), a novel 15-membered ring macrolide antibacterial agent].
AB  - Azithromycin (Zithromac), a 15-membered ring macrolide antibacterial agent, was approved to be manufactured in Japan in March 2000. It showed good in vitro and/or in vivo antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Peptostreptococcus micros, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. Its activity against H. influenzae was particularly more potent than that of currently used macrolide antibacterial agents. After oral administration to patients, azithromycin was readily absorbed and became widely distributed throughout the body, achieving higher concentrations in tissues and phagocytic cells than in serum or plasma. Its distribution into phagocytes was as high as more than 10 times that of erythromycin, and azithromycin was readily released from phagocytes in the presence of S. aureus. In experimentally infected mice, the concentration of azithromycin was higher in infected tissues than in uninfected tissues, which indicated that azithromycin was selectively delivered to infected tissues by migrating phagocytes. These pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties were reflected in good clinical results for the treatment of respiratory infections and other infections with once daily dosing for 3 days.
TI  - In vitro activity and post-antibiotic effect of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid).
AB  - The in vitro activities of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid), ampicillin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, ciprofloxacin and tetracycline were examined and compared against 526 gram-positive bacteria. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for quinupristin/dalfopristin against Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains, were low (MIC(90) = 0.5 mg/l), and were comparable with those of vancomycin and teicoplanin. This compound was superior to the macrolides and highly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae (both penicillin-sensitive and penicillin-resistant strains), with MIC(90) = 2 mg/l. It was also active against other streptococci, with MIC(90) = 4 mg/l. However, this agent is less active against enterococci (MIC(90) = 32 mg/l). Quinupristin/dalfopristin showed high activity against gram-positive anaerobes, including Clostridium spp., Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp., with MIC(90) < or = 2 mg/l. Quinupristin/dalfopristin was also investigated for its post-antibiotic effect (PAE) and bactericidal kinetics against nine strains of gram-positive organisms, including staphylococci, enterococci and pneumococci. Exponentially growing (log phase) cultures were exposed to quinupristin/dalfopristin at 2 x MIC. Growth kinetics was evaluated using viable counting. The drug was uniformly bactericidal against pneumococci and staphylococci within 2 and 8 h of exposure, respectively. The killing activity against enterococci was weak; there was little or no reduction in bacterial count over 24 h of incubation. PAEs ranging from 2.13 to 3.28 h, 0.92 to 3.02 h and 1.89 to 7.07 h were produced on the tested pneumococci, staphylococci and enterococci, respectively. This study showed that quinupristin/dalfopristin is a promising agent active against gram-positive bacteria. The prolonged PAEs also suggest that the drug could be used intermittently at more widely spaced dosing intervals against gram-positive organisms.
TI  - Recovery of anaerobic bacteria from 3 patients with infection at a pierced body site.
AB  - We describe 3 adolescents who developed infections due to anaerobes at pierced body sites: the nipple, the umbilicus, and the nasal septum. Anaerobes (Prevotella intermedia and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius) were recovered from pure culture of specimens obtained from 1 patient with nipple infection and were mixed with aerobic bacteria in cultures of specimens obtained from 2 patients (Streptococcus aureus, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Prevotella melaninogenica were recovered from a patient with nasal septum infection, and Bacteroides fragilis and Enterococcus faecalis were recovered from a patient with umbilical infection). The infection resolved in all patients after removal of the ornaments and use of antimicrobial drug treatment.
TI  - Bacteria isolated after unsuccessful endodontic treatment in a North American population.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the composition of the microbial flora present in teeth after the failure of root canal therapy in a North American population. These results were then compared with those of the previous Scandinavian studies. STUDY DESIGN: Fifty-four root-filled teeth with persistent periapical radiolucencies were selected for retreatment. After removal of the root-filling material, the canals were sampled with paper points, and by reaming of the apical dentin. Both samples were grown under aerobic and strict anaerobic conditions. Then the bacterial growth was analyzed. RESULTS: The microbial flora was mainly of 1 to 2 strains of predominantly gram-positive organisms. Enterococcus faecalis was the most commonly recovered bacterial species. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria were cultivated in 34 of the 54 teeth examined in the study. E faecalis was identified in 30% of the teeth with a positive culture.
TI  - A microbiological study of Papillon-Lefevre syndrome in two patients.
AB  - AIM: To analyse the microflora of subgingival plaque from patients with Papillon-Lefevre syndrome (PLS), which is a very rare disease characterised by palmar-plantar hyperkeratosis with precocious periodontal destruction. METHODS: Bacterial isolates were identified using a combination of commercial identification kits, traditional laboratory tests, and gas liquid chromatography. Some isolates were also subjected to partial 16S rDNA sequencing. Plaque samples were also assayed for the presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in a quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS: The culture results showed that most isolates were capnophilic and facultatively anaerobic species-mainly Capnocytophaga spp and Streptococcus spp. The latter included S. constellatus, S. oralis, and S. sanguis. Other facultative bacteria belonged to the genera gemella, kingella, leuconostoc, and stomatococcus. The aerobic bacteria isolated were species of neisseria and bacillus. Anaerobic species included Prevotella intermedia, P. melaninogenica, and P. nigrescens, as well as Peptostreptococcus spp. ELISA detected P gingivalis in one patient in all sites sampled, whereas A. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only one site from the other patient. Prevotella intermedia was present in low numbers. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PLS have a very complex subgingival flora including recognised periodontal pathogens. However, no particular periodontopathogen is invariably associated with PLS.
TI  - Linezolid: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  - Linezolid is the first of a new class of antibacterial drugs, the oxazolidinones. It has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus (GISA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The drug also shows activity against certain anaerobes, including Clostridium perfringens, C. difficile, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Bacteroidesfragilis. In controlled phase III studies, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and also demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by VRE. Further phase III studies have demonstrated that linezolid is an effective treatment for patients with nosocomial pneumonia, for hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and for patients with complicated skin or soft tissue infections (SSTIs). In these studies, linezolid was as effective as established treatments, including third-generation cephalosporins in patients with pneumonia, and oxacillin in patients with complicated SSTIs. Oral linezolid 400 or 600mg twice daily was as effective as clarithromycin 250mg twice daily or cefpodoxime proxetil 200mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with uncomplicated SSTIs or community-acquired pneumonia. Linezolid is a generally well tolerated drug. The most frequently reported adverse events in linezolid recipients were diarrhoea, headache, nausea and vomiting. Thrombocytopenia was also documented in a small proportion (about 2%) of patients treated with the drug. CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid has good activity against gram-positive bacteria, particularly multidrug resistant strains of S. aureus (including GISA), Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis (including VRE). In controlled clinical trials, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in eradicating infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. and has demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by VRE. As the level of resistance to vancomycin increases among S. aureus and enterococci, linezolid is poised to play an important role in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
TI  - [Cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis: microbiology and pathogenesis].
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes is a common cause of necrotizing cutaneous infections in otherwise healthy children and adults. Several surface components are involved in the processes of adherence and invasiveness, such as protein M and capsulae. Streptolysin O and other bacterial products, such as pyrogenic exotoxins, are involved in tissue injury and necrosis. Toxins A and C act as superantigens and are expressed by strains associated with the toxic shock syndrome. Staphylococcus aureus, alone or in association with streptococci, is also commonly isolated form all body sites, but bacteremia is inconstant. Capsule, protein A, and the staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome toxin are the major pathogenicity factors. In infections of the face and the neck, the predominant anaerobes recovered in association with group A streptococci are Peptostreptococcus magnus, oral Prevotella, Porphyromonas spp., and Fusobacterium spp. Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium, enterobacteria, and enterococci are recovered in infections located next to the perineal area. Penicillin is the drug of choice for the treatment of streptococcal infections. However benzylpenicillin may be not sufficient for severe infections and large inoculum, therefore the administration of clindamycin or another inhibitor of protein synthesis is recommended. Since the infection may be polymicrobial, the initial therapy should include treatment for staphylococci and anaerobes. In some cases broad- spectrum antibiotics also, effective on enterobacteria, are needed. The efficacy of appropriate parenteral antibiotics, however, depends on the prompt and aggressive exploration and debridement of suspected deep-seated infection, and supportive care of shock and multiple organ failure.
TI  - Immunoglobulin-binding domains of peptostreptococcal protein L enhance vaginal colonization of mice by Streptococcus gordonii.
AB  - Protein L, an immunoglobulin-binding protein of some strains of the anaerobic bacterium Peptostreptococcus magnus, has been hypothesized to be a virulence determinant in bacterial vaginosis. In order to investigate the role of protein L in peptostreptococcal virulence, the Ig-binding domains of protein L were expressed at the surface of the human oral commensal Streptococcus gordonii. Recombinant streptococci were used in vaginal colonization experiments, and protein L-expressing S. gordonii demonstrated enhanced ability to colonize the vaginal mucosa. Compared to the control strain, they also persisted for a longer period in the murine vagina.
TI  - Smoking and subgingival microflora in periodontal disease.
AB  - AIM: The present investigation was undertaken to analyze the influence of smoking on the periodontal disease associated subgingival microflora. The population included 33 smokers and 31 non-smokers in the age range 36-86 years. METHODS: Microbial samples were obtained from 4 sites per patient. The checker-board DNA-DNA hybridization technology was used for detection of the bacterial species P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, B. forsythus, A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum, T. denticola, P. micros, C. rectus, E. corrodens, S. noxia and S. intermedius. RESULTS: Using score 1 as cutoff, contrasting colonized versus non-colonized patients, 8 out of 12 species were detected in > or = 90% of both smokers and non-smokers. Using score 4 as cutoff, contrasting heavily colonized patients versus non-colonized and less heavily colonized patients, the detection rates decreased in both smokers and non-smokers. No significant differences in detection rates were observed between smokers and non-smokers. Logistic regression analysis indicated that neither smoking, probing depth nor gingival bleeding influenced the occurrence of the species analyzed. The lack of a smoking exposure dose-response further supported the indication of a limited influence of smoking. CONCLUSION: Smoking exerts little, if any, influence on the subgingival occurrence of several of the bacteria most commonly associated with periodontal disease.
TI  - Peritonsillar abscess-a clinico-bacteriological study.
AB  - This study comprised 32 cases of peritonsillar obscess (PTA)constitutint 0.08% of ENT outdoor cases and 0.80% of indoor admission. Age ranged from 14 years to 58 years(mean 34.21 +/- 10.25 SD years). Male predominance was seen in the ratio of 1.69:1. A triad of symptoms comprising pain, fever and peritonillar swelling was seen in 29 (90.62%) cases. Ipsilateral jugulodigastric lymphnode enlargement was the commonest sign present in all the cases. Bacterial culture was positive in 25 (78.12%) cases. Most common aerobic organism isolated was Group A beta hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) seen on 10 (27.77%) cases. Anaerobic culture could be done in 22 cases only. It was positive in 11 (50%) cases. Commonest isolate was Peptostreptococcus seen in 4 (18.18%) cases.
TI  - [Bacteriological study of chronic maxillary sinusitis in adults and observation of susceptibility to antibiotics].
AB  - The unilateral mucosal samples were taken from 42 patients and were cultured for  bacteria. Meanwhile, the antimicrobial susceptibility was determined for 11 antibiotics and the beta-lactamase-producing bacteria(beta LPB) were examined. In 85.71% of all samples, bacterial growth was present. Anaerobic bacteria were present in 21.43% of cases. Predominant aerobic bacteria were alpha-hemolytic streptococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Predominant anaerobic bacteria were peptostreptococcus species and bacteroides species. The beta LPB were isolated from 40% patients, which were responsible for the resistance to some antibiotics. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that the antibiotics containing beta-lactamase inhibitor, third-generation cephalosporins and third-generation quinolones had good efficacy. Our findings indicated the bacterial infection may not play the key role in the development of chronic sinusitis and the bacterial infection may not play the key role in the development of chronic sinusitis and the resistance to some antibiotics due to the high prevalence of beta-lactamase production must be considered when the antibiotics therapy is taken.
TI  - Microorganisms isolated from root canals presenting necrotic pulp and their drug  susceptibility in vitro.
AB  - The knowledge about causative agents involved in endodontic infections is increasing, especially due to the improvement of culture techniques for anaerobic bacteria, showing that these microorganisms are predominant in this pathology. In this study, 31 canals with pulp necrosis were microbiologically analyzed before and after manipulation. Obligate and facultative anaerobes, microaerophilic bacteria and yeasts were recovered from 24, 14, 5 and 2 clinical specimens, respectively. The most frequent genera were Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Clostridium and Peptostreptococcus for bacteria and Candida and Saccharomyces for yeasts. Strong positive associations, using an odds ratio system, were found between Clostridium and Prevotella and between Peptostreptococcus and Fusobacterium. Even after the instrumentation and the use of Ca(OH)2, facultative anaerobes were detected in two root canals and yeasts in three. Microorganisms were isolated from seven canals at the end of the endodontic treatment: facultative anaerobes from five and yeasts from one. The microbiological evaluation of root canals with pulp necrosis suggests the presence of polymicrobial infections, mainly involving obligate anaerobes, and shows that the infection may persist after treatment.
TI  - Growth inhibitory activity of gutta-percha points containing root canal medications on common endodontic bacterial pathogens as determined by an optimized quantitative in vitro assay.
AB  - Gutta-percha points containing calcium hydroxide, zinc oxide (ZnO), a mixture of  ZnO and chlorhexidine (ZnO/CHX), iodine-polyvinylpyrrolidone (ZnO/J-PVP), or a mixture of CHX and J-PVP and ZnO (ZnO/CHX/J-PVP) were tested for their ability to inhibit growth of pure cultures of bacterial species commonly involved in endodontic infections (Peptostreptococcus micros, Streptococcus intermedius, Enterococcus faecalis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis). To quantitate growth inhibition, an in vitro assay was established that controlled for important parameters of root canal infection. Approximately 10(7) bacteria per assay were suspended in diluted human serum and co-incubated with the gutta-percha points in an anaerobic atmosphere for up to 2 wk. Aliquots used for determination of colony counts were taken on days 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 of incubation. As judged by colony-forming unit reduction kinetics and final counts, calcium hydroxide had better growth inhibitory activity than ZnO/CHX, ZnO/J-PVP, and ZnO alone for all bacteria tested except Peptostreptococcus micros. The combination of CHX and J-PVP with ZnO did not render results different from those of ZnO/CHX or ZnO/J-PVP. The results of this study support the introduction of standardized assays for testing antibacterial properties of root canal medications under conditions that more closely resemble those encountered in endodontal infections.
TI  - Interleukin-6 deficiency increases inflammatory bone destruction.
AB  - Periapical bone destruction occurs as a consequence of pulpal infection. In previous studies, we showed that interleukin-1 (IL-1) is the primary stimulator of bone destruction in this model. IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine that is induced in these infections and has both pro- and anti-inflammatory activities. In the present study, we determined the role of IL-6 in regulating IL-1 expression and bone resorption. The first molars of IL-6 knockouts (IL-6(-/-)) and wild-type mice were subjected to surgical pulp exposure and infection with a mixture of four common pulpal pathogens, including Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Streptococcus intermedius. Mice were killed after 21 days, and bone destruction and cytokine expression were determined. Surprisingly, bone destruction was significantly increased in IL-6(-/-) mice versus that in wild-type mice (by 30%; P < 0.001). In a second experiment, the effects of chronic (IL-6(-/-)) IL-6 deficiency and short-term IL-6 deficiency induced by in vivo antibody neutralization were determined. Both IL-6(-/-) (30%; P < 0.001) and anti-IL-6 antibody-treated mice (40%; P < 0.05) exhibited increased periapical bone resorption, compared to wild-type controls. The increased bone resorption in IL-6-deficient animals correlated with increases in osteoclast numbers, as well as with elevated expression of bone-resorptive cytokines IL-1alpha and IL-1beta, in periapical lesions and with decreased expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. These data demonstrate that endogenous IL-6 expression has significant anti-inflammatory effects in modulating infection-stimulated bone destruction in vivo.
TI  - Macrolide resistance in Peptostreptococcus spp. mediated by ermTR: possible source of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance in Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Eighty percent (21 of 26) of macrolide-resistant Peptostreptococcus strains studied harbored the ermTR gene. This methyltransferase gene is also the most frequently found gene among macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes strains. Transfer of the ermTR gene from Peptostreptococcus magnus to macrolide-susceptible S. pyogenes strains indicates that this resistance determinant may circulate among gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic species of the oropharyngeal bacterial flora.
TI  - Two cases of diskitis attributable to anaerobic bacteria in children.
AB  - Diskitis, an inflammation of the intervertebral disk, is generally attributable to Staphylococcus aureus and rarely Staphylococcus epidermidis, Kingella kingae, Enterobacteriaciae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In many cases, no bacterial growth is obtained from infected intervertebral discs. Although anaerobic bacteria were recovered from adults with spondylodiscitis, these organisms were not reported before from children. The recovery of anaerobic bacteria in 2 children with diskitis is reported. Patient 1. A 10-year-old male presented with 6 weeks of low back pain and 2 weeks of low-grade fever and abdominal pain. Physical examination was normal except for tenderness to percussion over the spine between thoracic vertebra 11 and lumbar vertebra 2. The patient had a temperature of 104 degrees F. Laboratory tests were within normal limits, except for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), which was 58 mm/hour. Blood culture showed no growth. Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast revealed minimal inflammatory changes in the 12th thoracic vertebra/first lumbar vertebra disk. There was no other abnormality. A computed tomography (CT)-guided aspiration of the disk space yielded bloody material, which was sent for aerobic and anaerobic cultures. Gram stain showed numerous white blood cells and Gram-positive cocci in chains. Cultures for anaerobic bacteria yielded heavy growth of Peptostreptococcus magnus, which was susceptible to penicillin, clindamycin, and vancomycin. The patient was treated with intravenous penicillin 600 000 units every 6 hours for 3 weeks, and then oral amoxicillin, 500 mg every 6 hours for 3 weeks. The back pain resolved within 2 weeks, and the ESR returned to normal at the end of therapy. Follow-up for 3 years showed complete resolution of the infection. Patient 2. An 8-year-old boy presented with low back pain and low-grade fever, irritability, and general malaise for 10 days. He had had an upper respiratory tract infection with sore throat 27 days earlier, for which he received no therapy. The patient had a temperature of 102 degrees F, and physical examination was normal except for tenderness to percussion over the spine between the second and fourth lumbar vertebrae. Laboratory tests were normal, except for the ESR (42 mm/hour). Radiographs of the spine showed narrowing of the third to fourth lumbar vertebra disk space and irregularity of the margins of the vertebral endplates. A CT scan revealed a lytic bone lesion at lumbar vertebra 4, and bone scan showed an increase uptake of (99m)technetium at the third to fourth lumbar vertebra disk space. CT-guided aspiration of the disk space yielded cloudy nonfoul-smelling material, which was sent for aerobic and anaerobic cultures. Gram stain showed numerous white blood cells and fusiform Gram-negative bacilli. Anaerobic culture grew light growth of Fusobacterium nucleatum. The organism produced beta-lactamase and was susceptible to ticarcillin-clavulanate, clindamycin, metronidazole, and imipenem. Therapy with clindamycin 450 mg every 8 hours was given parenterally for 3 weeks and orally for 3 weeks. Back pain resolved within 2 weeks. A 2-year follow-up showed complete resolution and no recurrence. This report describes, for the first time, the isolation of anaerobic bacteria from children with diskitis. The lack of their recovery in previous reports and the absence of bacterial growth in over two third of these studies may be caused by the use of improper methods for their collection, transportation, and cultivation. Proper choice of antimicrobial therapy for diskitis can be accomplished only by identification of the causative organisms and its antimicrobial susceptibility. This is of particular importance in infections caused by anaerobic bacteria that are often resistant to antimicrobials used to empirically treat diskitis. This was the case in our second patient, who was infected by F nucleatum, which was resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. The origin of the anaerobic bacteria causing the infection in our patient is probably of endogenous nature. The presence of abdominal pain in the first child may have been attributable to a subclinical abdominal pathothology. The preceding pharyngitis in the second patient may have been associated with a potential hematogenous spread of F nucleatum. P magnus has been associated with bone and joint infections. This report highlights the importance of obtaining disk space culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from all children with diskitis. Future prospective studies are warranted to elucidate the role of anaerobic bacteria in diskitis in children.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  - A diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. To investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. Forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. Streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), Streptococcus mitis (66-65%), Prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), Eikenella corrodens (51-52%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), Capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), Actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and Prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. Several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella loescheii, Campylobacter gracilis, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter concisus, Peptostreptococcus micros and Selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. The bacterial species Streptococcus constellatus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, E. corrodens and Fusobacterium nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas Streptococcus intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were associated with bleeding.
TI  - Bacteriology of histopathologically defined appendicitis in children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in childhood. However, the pathogenesis and detailed microbiology are obscure. OBJECTIVE: To determine in detail the bacterial etiology of appendicitis in children in relation to the histologic tissue pathology. STUDY DESIGN: Tissue samples obtained at surgery from 41 children with suspected acute appendicitis were examined histologically and by culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The patients were analyzed according to histopathologic and clinical findings. RESULTS: Aerobic and anaerobic species were isolated from 40 of 41 (98%) samples; on average, 14.1 isolates per specimen (10.4 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes). Specimens from patients with gangrenous appendices yielded significantly higher numbers of anaerobic isolates per specimen than did specimens from patients with healthy appendices (11.7 vs. 7.7; P < 0.01). Bacteria belonging to the Bacteroides fragilis group were the most frequently isolated anaerobic microorganisms (95%). Other organisms frequently isolated in all histology groups were Peptostreptococcus micros (66%), Bilophila wadsworthia (63%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (44%), Eggerthella lenta (44%) and a hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing Gram-negative rod (41%). Of the aerobes Escherichia coli (88%) and Streptococcus anginosus group (former Streptococcus "milleri" group) organisms (61%) were the most frequent findings. CONCLUSIONS: The shift from histologically normal toward gangrenous appendices was clearly associated with markedly elevated anaerobic bacterial counts in terms of species. The unusually high frequencies of B. wadsworthia (75%) and the hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing Gram-negative rod (56%) in gangrenous appendices represent unique and different findings from those reported in adults.
TI  - Bacteriology in disease: failure of a micro-ecological balance?
AB  - Both aerobic (mainly alpha-haemolytic streptococci) and anaerobic micro-organisms (like Prevotella and Peptostreptococcus species) are able to interfere with the growth of potential pathogens such as group A beta-haemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. The present paper reviews the application of this concept of interference with respect to the development of common acute ear-, nose- and throat infections.
TI  - Microbiological parameters associated with IL-1 gene polymorphisms in periodontitis patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND, AIMS: Polymorphisms in the cluster of IL-1 genes have been significantly associated with the severity of adult periodontitis. The purpose of this study was to compare microbiological parameters in IL-1 genotype negative and positive adult subjects with a range of periodontitis severities. METHOD: The study included 108 subjects in good general health. Clinical parameters were recorded at 6 sites/tooth excluding 3rd molars and included: plaque accumulation, gingival erythema, bleeding on probing, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment level. Subgingival plaque samples were collected from the mesiobuccal surface of up to 28 teeth in each subject (mean 25.3) providing a total of 2736 samples. The levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in each sample using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Fingerstick blood samples were collected for IL-1A (+4845) and IL-1B (+3954) genotyping using PCR-based methods. RESULTS: The proportion of IL-1 genotype positive subjects that exhibited mean counts of specific subgingival species above selected thresholds was significantly higher than the proportion of genotype negative subjects. Prominent among species that were detected at higher levels in genotype positive subjects were members of the "red" and "orange" complexes and included: Bacteroides forsythus, Treponema denticola, the Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, Fusobacterium periodonticum, Campylobacter gracilis, Campylobacter showae and Streptococcus constellatus. Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus gordonii and 3 Capnocytophaga species were also detected more frequently at high numbers in genotype positive subjects. Significantly higher mean counts of B. forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, T. denticola, the F. nucleatum subspecies, F. periodonticum, Campylobacter rectus, C. showae, Eubacterium nodatum, S. constellatus, S. gordonii, and S. intermedius were detected at periodontal pockets >6 mm in subjects who were genotype positive when compared with genotype negative subjects. The increase was due to increased numbers of cells of these species rather than a major shift in proportion. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that genotype positive subjects more frequently had higher levels of "red" and "orange" complex species that are known to be strongly associated with measures of periodontal inflammation.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between April 1997 and March 1998].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 19 facilities in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained during the period from April 1997 to March 1998. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 215 for one year. A total of 420 strains (170 strains from primary infections and 250 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 174 cases (80.9% of total cases). In primary infections, the isolation rate of anaerobic bacteria was higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, which was frequently isolated from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. We found neither vancomycin nor arbekacin resistant strains of S. aureus, and found no vancomycin resistant strains of Enterococcus spp. The susceptibility of P. aeruginosa against carbapenems did not decline in the year 1997, while resistance of B. fragilis group against cephems advanced increasingly.
TI  - B-Cell deficiency predisposes mice to disseminating anaerobic infections: protection by passive antibody transfer.
AB  - We have previously demonstrated that a high proportion of RAG-2 SCID knockout mice, which lack T and B cells, develop orofacial abscesses and disseminated infections following pulpal infection, whereas immunocompetent control mice do not. In the present study, we sought to identify the components of the adaptive immune response which contribute to protection against disseminating anaerobic infections and sepsis. For this purpose, various genetically engineered immunodeficient mice were employed, including RAG-2 SCID, Igh-6 (B-cell deficient), Tcrb Tcrd (T-cell deficient) and Hc(0) (C5 deficient). For abscess induction, the mandibular first molars were subjected to pulp exposure on day 0. Teeth were infected with a mixture of four anaerobic pathogens, including Prevotella intermedia, Streptococcus intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus micros, and teeth were sealed to prevent communication with the oral cavity. The findings demonstrate that both RAG-2 SCID and B-cell-deficient mice, but not T-cell- or C5-deficient mice, have increased susceptibility to the development of disseminating anaerobic infections. Abscess-susceptible RAG-2 SCID and B-cell-deficient mice also showed a significant loss of body weight, splenomegaly, and absent antibacterial antibody production. Furthermore, dissemination was significantly reduced, from 74 to 25%, in susceptible RAG-2 mice by passively transferred antibody, predominantly immunoglobulin G2b (IgG2b) and IgM, against the infecting bacterial innoculum. Fractionated IgG-enriched preparations were more efficient in transferring protection than IgM preparations. We conclude that an antibody-mediated mechanism(s), most likely bacterial opsonization, is of importance in localizing anaerobic root canal infections and in preventing their systemic spread.
TI  - Bacterial immunoglobulin superantigen proteins A and L activate human heart mast  cells by interacting with immunoglobulin E.
AB  - Human heart mast cells (HHMC) have been identified in heart tissue, perivascularly, and in the intima of coronary arteries. In vitro activation of isolated HHMC induces the release of vasoactive and proinflammatory mediators (histamine, tryptase, and cysteinyl leukotriene C(4) [LTC(4)]). We investigated the effects of several bacterial proteins on HHMC activation in vitro. HHMC released histamine, tryptase, and LTC(4) in response to Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1 and the immunoglobulin (Ig)-binding protein A, but not to S. aureus Wood 46, which does not synthesize protein A. The effect of protein A was inhibited by preincubation with monoclonal IgM V(H)3(+). Some strains of Peptostreptococcus magnus express an Ig light chain-binding surface protein called protein L. Such bacteria and soluble protein L stimulated the release of preformed and newly synthesized mediators from HHMC. Preincubation of HHMC with either protein A or protein L resulted in complete cross-desensitization to a subsequent challenge with the heterologous stimulus or anti-IgE. Monoclonal IgE (kappa chains) blocked protein L-induced release, whereas IgE (lambda chains) had no effect. Streptococcal protein G, formyl-containing tripeptide, and pepstatin A did not activate HHMC. Bacterial products protein A and protein L and intact bacteria (S. aureus and P. magnus) activate HHMC by acting as Ig superantigens.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of GAR-936 against aerobic and anaerobic animal and human bite wound pathogens.
AB  - GAR-936 is a new semisynthetic glycylcycline with a broad antibacterial spectrum, including tetracycline-resistant strains. The in vitro activities of GAR-936, minocycline, doxycycline, tetracycline, moxifloxacin, penicillin G, and erythromycin were determined by agar dilution methods against 268 aerobic and 148 anaerobic strains of bacteria (including Pasteurella, Eikenella, Moraxella, Bergeyella, Neisseria, EF-4, Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Corynebacterium, Propionibacterium, Peptostreptococcus, and Actinomyces) isolated from infected human and animal bite wounds in humans, including strains resistant to commonly used antimicrobials. GAR-936 was very active, with an MIC at which 90% of the strains are inhibited (MIC(90)) of < or =0.25 microg/ml, against all aerobic gram-positive and -negative strains, including tetracycline-resistant strains of Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci, except for Eikenella corrodens (MIC(90), < or =4 microg/ml). GAR-936 was also very active against all anaerobic species, including tetracycline-, doxycycline-, and minocycline-resistant strains of Prevotella spp., Porphyromonas spp., Bacteroides tectum, and Peptostreptococcus spp., with an MIC(90) of < or =0.25 microg/ml. Erythromycin- and moxifloxacin-resistant fusobacteria were susceptible to GAR-936, with an MIC(90) of 0.06 microg/ml.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of a new injectable carbapenem, S-4661, against gynaecological pathogens.
AB  - Carbapenems are often used to treat infections in obstetrics and gynaecology because of their activity against anaerobes. S-4661, a new injectable carbapenem antibiotic, has favourable pharmacokinetic properties and is not hydrolysed by dehydropeptidase I. We investigated the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of S-4661 against strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Peptostreptococcus magnus, Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella bivia, which are major pathogens in the fields of obstetrics and gynaecology. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) of S-4661 for these strains were 0.25 and 1 mg/L, respectively. The in vivo efficacy of S-4661 was evaluated in a rat model of intrauterine infection, namely pyometra caused by E. coli and B. fragilis. The accumulation of neutrophils in the uterus in the S-4661-treated group was less marked and the number of bacteria significantly lower than those in the untreated group. These results suggest that S-4661 may be useful for treating polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynaecology.
TI  - Post-caesarean septicaemia in Kandang Kerbau Hospital, Singapore, 1993-1995.
AB  - We reviewed all documented cases of septicaemia following caesarean deliveries in Kandang Kerbau Hospital between 1st January 1993 to 31st December 1995. There were 22 cases of septicaemia among 8201 caesarean births, and hence the incidence is 2.7:1000. There were 45,412 deliveries, and the overall caesarean section rate was 18.1%. Among the 22 documented cases of septicaemia which came under this study, the most common clinical conditions found were endomyometritis (7 cases), urinary tract infection (6 cases), and wound infection (3 cases). One of the three cases with wound infection also had pneumonia. There was one patient who had mild transient myocarditis. We could not determine with certainty any site of infection in five patients. The most common bloodstream bacterial isolates was Staphylococcus aureus (16), while the uncommon ones were Acinetobacter baumanii (2), Escherichia coli (1), Klebsiella sp. (1), Staphylococcus epidermidis (1), Streptococcus Group F (1), Peptostreptococcus species and Veillonella species (1). There was no mortality and prompt, vigorous treatment had led to uneventful recovery in all the cases.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology in intra-abdominal infections associated with  diverticulitis.
AB  - The aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of intra-abdominal infections associated with diverticulitis was studied in 110 specimens from the peritoneal cavity after intestinal perforation and in 22 specimens from abdominal abscesses. Anaerobic bacteria only were isolated from 17 (15%) of the peritoneal specimens, aerobic bacteria only from 12 (11%) and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora from 81 (74%). A total of 339 bacterial isolates was detected in peritoneal cultures (3.1 per specimen), comprising 155 aerobes (1.4 per specimen) and 184 anaerobes (1.7 per specimen). Anaerobic bacteria only were isolated in 4 (18%) abscesses, aerobes alone in one (5%) and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora in 17 (77%). A total of 72 bacterial isolates (3.3 per specimen) was detected in abdominal abscesses - 35 aerobes (1.6 per specimen) and 37 aerobes (1.7 per specimen). The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria in abdominal infections were Escherichia coli and Streptococcus spp. The most frequently isolated anaerobes were Bacteroides spp. (B. fragilis group), Peptostreptococcus, Clostridium and Fusobacterium spp.
TI  - [The treatment of bacterial vaginosis with Dalacin V cream].
AB  - To asses the efficiency of the 2% clindamycin phosphate creme given in 3 and 7 daily courses officially designer for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV). METHODS: The study includes 65 patients who have microbiological data for BV 11 of the women are pregnant (18.46%). The microbiological study includes there agent: Streptococcus agalactiae, E. colli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus species, Prevotella species, Mobiluncus species, Staphylococcus epidermidis et Enterococcus fecalis. The controls visit was assessed on the 7'] and 28'] day after the therapy. RESULTS: There were successful results on the 84.3% of the patients after 7 day course but in the 3-day course the good results were showed in 73.91% of the women. After the 28"] day there were only few successful results 43%. CONCLUSIONS: The clindamycin phosphate is more preferable method for the treatment of BV.
TI  - Critical role of beta-hairpin formation in protein G folding.
AB  - Comparison of the folding mechanisms of proteins with similar structures but very different sequences can provide fundamental insights into the determinants of protein folding mechanisms. Despite very little sequence similarity, the approximately 60 residue IgG binding domains of protein G and protein L both consist of a single helix packed against a four-stranded sheet formed by two symmetrically disposed beta-hairpins. We demonstrate that, as in the case of protein L, one of the two beta-turns of protein G is formed and the other disrupted in the folding transition state. Unlike protein L, however, in protein G it is the second beta-turn that is formed in the folding transition state ensemble. Substitution of an Asp residue by Ala in protein G that eliminates an i,i+2 side chain-main chain hydrogen bond in the second beta-turn slows the folding rate approximately 20-fold but has virtually no effect on the unfolding rate. Taken together with previous results, these findings suggest that the presence of an intact beta-turn in the folding transition state is a consequence of the overall topology of protein L and protein G, but the particular hairpin that is formed is determined by the detailed interatomic interactions that determine the free energies of formation of the isolated beta-hairpins.
TI  - Characterization of bacterial orofacial infections using a new murine model.
AB  - We devised a new murine orofacial infection model using bacteria from odontogenic infection origins and characterized the experimental infections. In this model, bacteria were injected into the submandible of mice. Streptococcus constellatus and Peptostreptococcus micros produced a single abscess at the injection site and their abscess-forming and lethal abilities were low: the median abscess-forming dose (AF(50)) of S. constellatus and P. micros were 10(8.5-10.7)and 10(10.2-10.6)cfu/mouse, and their median lethal dose (LD(50)) were >11 and 10(10.6-11)cfu/mouse, respectively. Prevotella oralis and Fusobacterium nucleatum produced multiple abscesses and their abscess-forming and lethal abilities were strong: AF(50)of P. oralis and F. nucleatum were 10(6.0-6.4)and 10(7. 0-8.7)cfu/mouse, and their LD(50)were 10(7.0-7.7)and 10(8.3-9. 9)cfu/mouse, respectively. LD(50)of P. intermedia and P. gingivalis were 10(9.4->11)and 10(8.9-9.1)cfu/mouse, respectively. Prevotella intermedia and Porphyromonas gingivalis generated a necrotizing lesion, which progressed rapidly. We conclude that this murine model could reflect human orofacial odontogenic infections and is useful to investigate the pathogenicity of causative bacteria of such infections.
TI  - Interleukin-1 receptor signaling rather than that of tumor necrosis factor is critical in protecting the host from the severe consequences of a polymicrobe anaerobic infection.
AB  - Infection of the dental pulp leads to an osteolytic lesion that results from a polymicrobial infection consisting largely of pathogenic anaerobes. Infection causes significant morbidity and mortality mediated by bacterial factors and in some cases by the up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines. The inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), in particular, play a complex and central role in the responses to microbial pathogens. However, relatively little is known about the significance of these cytokines in protecting the host from focal polymicrobial anaerobic infections. To establish the relative importance of IL-1 and TNF in mediating the response to a mixed anaerobic infection, we inoculated the dental pulp of mice with six anaerobic pathogens containing functional deletions of receptors to IL-1 (IL-1R1(-/-)), TNF (TNFRp55(-/-)-p75(-/-)), or both (TNFRp55(-/-)-IL-1RI(-/-)). The results indicate that IL-1 receptor signaling and TNF receptor signaling both play similarly important roles in protecting the host from local tissue damage. However, IL-1 receptor signaling is considerably more important than TNF receptor signaling in preventing the spread of infection into surrounding fascial planes, since IL-1R1(-/-) but not TNFRp55(-/-)-p75(-/-) mice exhibited significantly higher morbidity and mortality. Moreover, all of the fatal infections occurred in male mice, suggesting the importance of gender differences in limiting the impact of these infections.
TI  - Toll-like receptor 4-deficient mice have reduced bone destruction following mixed anaerobic infection.
AB  - C3H/HeJ mice have an impaired ability to respond to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) due  to a mutation in the gene that encodes Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). The effect of TLR4 deficiency on host responses to endodontic infections is unknown. In the present study, we compared periapical bone destruction, sepsis, and inflammatory cytokine production in LPS-hyporesponsive C3H/HeJ and wild-type control C3H/HeOuJ mice. The mandibular first molars of both strains were subjected to pulpal exposure and infection with a mixture of four anaerobic pathogens, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus intermedius, and Peptostreptococcus micros. At sacrifice on day 21, TLR4-deficient C3H/HeJ mice had significantly reduced periapical bone destruction compared to wild-type C3H/HeOuJ mice (P < 0.001). The decreased bone destruction in C3H/HeJ correlated with reduced expression of the bone resorptive cytokines interleukin 1alpha (IL-1alpha) (P < 0.01) and IL-1beta (P < 0.05) as well as the proinflammatory cytokine IL-12 (P < 0.05). No significant differences were seen in the levels of gamma interferon, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), or IL-10 between the two strains. The expression of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-10, and IL-12 were all significantly reduced in vitro in macrophages from both TLR4-deficient C3H/HeJ and C57BL/10ScNCr strains, compared to wild-type controls. Notably, the responses of TLR4-deficient macrophages to both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were similarly reduced. Neither C3H/HeJ nor C3H/HeOuJ mice exhibited orofacial abscess development or infection dissemination as determined by splenomegaly or cachexia. We conclude that intact TLR function mediates increased proinflammatory responses and bone destruction in response to mixed anaerobic infections.
TI  - Proteolysis and utilization of albumin by enrichment cultures of subgingival microbiota.
AB  - Subgingival dental plaque consists mainly of microorganisms that derive their energy from amino acid fermentation. Their nutrient requirements are met by the subgingival proteolytic system, which includes proteases from microorganism and inflammatory cells, and substrate proteins from sulcus exudate, including albumin. To determine the selective effect of individual proteins on microbiota, we used albumin as the main substrate for growth. Eight subgingval plaque samples from untreated periodontal pockets of patients with adult periodontitis were inoculated in peptone yeast medium with bovine albumin (9 g/l). After three subculture steps, cell yields of the enrichment cultures at the medium with 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 g/l albumin were determined. Proteolytic activity (U/absorbance at 550 nm) of the enrichment cultures and different isolates derived from the cultures was estimated by the degradation of resorufin-labeled casein. It was observed that the yield of the mixed culture was albumin limited, and the proteolytic activities of the cultures in albumin broth were higher than in control (peptone broth). Among the isolates from the enrichment cultures, Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella buccae and Prevotella bivia demonstrated proteolysis. The frequent occurrence of Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus anginosus in the albumin cultures is explained by their ability to utilize arginine as an energy source for growth. Albumin in the medium was partly degraded by pure cultures but completely consumed in enrichment cultures, indicating synergy of bacterial proteinases. It is concluded that the subgingival microbiota possesses proteolytic activity and may use albumin as a substrate for their growth. Enrichment cultures on albumin may serve as a relatively simple in vitro model to evaluate the effects of proteinase inhibitors.
TI  - Microbiology of infected poison ivy dermatitis.
AB  - We report the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of secondarily infected poison ivy dermatitis. The study involved retrospective review of clinical and microbiology laboratory records of patients with secondarily infected poison ivy lesions. Bacterial growth was noted in 33 specimens. Aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria only were present in 18 (55%) patients, anaerobic bacteria only in seven (21%), and mixed anaerobic-aerobic bacteria in eight (24%). Forty-five isolates were recovered (1.4 per specimen): 27 aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria, and 18 strict anaerobes. The predominant aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (13 isolates) and group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (six). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (seven isolates), pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. (four) and Fusobacterium spp. (two). Single bacterial isolates were recovered in 18 (55%) patients, eight of which were S. aureus. Nineteen of the organisms isolated from 16 (48%) patients produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. Organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to the lesions predominated in those infections. Enteric gram-negative rods and Bacteroides fragilis group predominated in leg and buttock lesions. Group A beta-haemolytic streptococci, pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium spp. were most frequently recovered from lesions of the finger, face and neck. The polymicrobial aetiology of secondarily infected poison ivy lesions, and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomical site of the lesions, are demonstrated.
TI  - In vitro inhibition of commercial douche products against vaginal microflora.
AB  - Recently, vaginal douching has been associated with many health risks in women. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of commercial douche products against various vaginal microorganisms, including lactobacilli. Seven commercial douches were tested against eight Lactobacillus clinical isolates and three type strains from the American Type Culture Collection. BV-associated bacteria included six strains of five genera: Gardnerella, Mobiluncus, Mycoplasma, Peptostreptococcus, and Ureaplasma. Two isolates of group B Streptococcus, and three species of Candida were also tested. The minimal inhibition concentrations and minimal contact times for these products against vaginal microorganisms were determined in broth cultures. Four antiseptic-containing douche products showed a strong inhibitory effect against all vaginal microorganisms tested with a short contact time (less than 1 min). Three vinegar-containing douche products selectively inhibited vaginal pathogens associated with bacterial vaginosis, group B streptococcal vaginitis, and candidiasis, but not lactobacilli. The antimicrobial effects of the commercial douche products varied among different brands and microbial species tested.
TI  - Dynamics of nasopharyngitis in children.
AB  - PURPOSE: Our goal was to characterize the dynamics and bacterial interaction of the aerobic and anaerobic flora of nasal discharge of children at different stages of uncomplicated nasopharyngitis. METHODS AND PATIENTS: Serial semiquantitative nasopharyngeal (NP) and quantitative nasal discharge (ND) cultures were taken every 3 to 5 days from 20 children in whom purulent discharge eventually developed (group 1), and a single culture was obtained from a group of 20 who had only clear discharge (group 2). RESULTS: Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated from all NP cultures. Bacterial growth was present in 8 (40%) NDs of group 2. Only 7 (35%) of the clear NDs of group 1 showed bacterial growth; the number increased to 14 (70%) at the mucoid stage and 20 (100%) at the purulent stage. It declined to 6 (30%) at the final clear stage. The number of species and total number of organisms increased in the NDs of group 1. Group 1 patients had higher recovery rates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae in their NP cultures than group 2 patients (P < 0.05). During the purulent stage, Peptostreptococcus species were isolated in 15 (75%), Fusobacterium species in 10 (50%), Prevotella species in 9 (45%), H influenzae in 8 (40%), S pneumoniae in 6 (30%), and beta-hemolytic streptococci in 5 (25%) of group 1 NDs. This was higher than their recovery in the clear stages of both groups and the mucoid stage of group 1. A total of 8 organisms capable of interfering with the growth of potential pathogens were isolated from the NPs of group 1, as compared with 35 from group 2 (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The development of purulent nasopharyngitis is associated with the pre-existing presence of potential pathogens and the absence of interfering organisms.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  - Eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. The aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. Forty-one different microbial species were isolated. Gemella morbillorum and Peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while P. micros, Streptococcus intermedius, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella loeschei, P. melaninogenica and Selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. The bacterial species S. constellatus, G. morbillorum and P. magnus were isolated in greater numbers in incisors and P. micros, S. intermedius, Campylobacter concisus, Bacteroides egertheii, B. forsythus, P. oralis and S. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. Cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. Cluster I was predominated by S. constellatus, S. mitis, S. sanguis, G. morbillorum, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; cluster II was predominated by S. sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, C. ochracea and P. intermedia; cluster III was predominated by S. mitis, C. ochracea, F. nucleatum, P. loeschei, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; and finally cluster IV was predominated by S. sanguis, C. gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Campylobacter gracilis, F. nucleatum and P. intermedia. The bacterial species S. constellatus, P. micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Eikenella corrodens and F. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while S. intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.
TI  - [In vitro activities of levofloxacin and other antibiotics against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - In this study, the in vitro activity of levofloxacin (LVFX) against 1,020 fresh bacterial clinical isolates was compared with the activities of a range of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin (CPFX), ampicillin (ABPC), cefaclor, cefpodoxime, methicillin and benzylpenicillin. The clinical isolates except Vibrio cholerae were collected in Japan during 1998 from patients with infectious diseases. MICs were determined using the agar dilution method according to the recommendations by the Japan Society of Chemotherapy. Some isolates of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and coagulase negative Staphylococcus were resistant to fluoroquinolones, but the MIC50 of LVFX against MRSA was 6.25 micrograms/ml. LVFX was the most active against MRSA among the antibiotics tested. Most of Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were susceptible to the fluoroquinolones. LVFX showed greater activity against all streptococci strains compared with fluoroquinolones tested. In particular, all Streptococcus pneumoniae strains including PRSP were susceptible to LVFX at < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml. Among Enterococcus, ABPC showed superior activity against Enterococcus faecalis but many isolates of Enterococcus species were resistant to ABPC. LVFX was more active against to these Enterococcus species compared with other fluoroquinolones. On the other hand, LVFX and CPFX showed similar activity against isolates of Enterobacteriaceae. CPFX had an MIC50/90 of 0.20, 0.39 microgram/ml and LVFX showed an MIC50/90 of 0.78, 1.56 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. LVFX (MIC50/90 0.10, 0.20 microgram/ml) was more active against Acinetobacter species than CPFX (MIC50/90 0.10, 0.39 microgram/ml). Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella (Moraxella) catarrhalis and V. cholerae were inhibited by low concentration of the fluoroquinolones tested. The MIC90 of LVFX and CPFX were < or = 0.10 microgram/ml against above three species. Some isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Campylobacter species were moderately resistant to the fluoroquinolones tested but the MIC50 of LVFX and CPFX were < or = 0.39 microgram/ml. Among anaerobes, Propionibacterium acnes was more susceptible than Peptostreptococcus species, and the MIC90 of beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones tested were < or = 0.78 microgram/ml. In conclusion, this study, performed on large number of strains, confirmed an excellent and wide spectrum antibacterial activity of LVFX compared with the fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams tested. And our results suggest that LVFX may be useful in the treatment of various bacterial infections.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of concurrent chronic otitis media with effusion and chronic sinusitis in children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To correlate the aerobic and anaerobic microbiologic findings of concurrent chronic otitis media with effusion and chronic maxillary sinusitis. METHODS: Cultures were obtained from 32 children with concurrent chronic otitis media with effusion and maxillary sinusitis who underwent tympanostomy tube placement. RESULTS: A total of 42 isolates, 24 aerobic and 18 anaerobic, were recovered from 30 patients; 27 were isolated from both sites, 4 from the ear only, and 11 from the sinus only. The most common isolates were Haemophilus influenzae (9 isolates), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 7), Prevotella species (n = 8), and Peptostreptococcus species (n = 6). Microbiological concordance between the ear and sinus was found in 22 (69%) of culture-positive patients. CONCLUSION: The concordance in recovery of organisms in more than two thirds of the patients illustrates the common bacterial etiology between chronic otitis media with effusion and chronic sinusitis in children.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of biapenem in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - Biapenem is a new injectable carbapenem antibiotic which has favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and is stable to hydrolysis by dehydropeptidase I. Biapenem inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Peptostreptococcus magnus, Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella bivia at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. The MIC(90) of biapenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was lower than that of panipenem, equivalent to that of imipenem, and greater than that of meropenem. The in vivo efficacy of biapenem was evaluated using the experimental infection model of uterine endometritis. The accumulation of neutrophils in the uterus in the biapenem- treated group was less marked than in the nontreated group, as well as bacteriological response. These results suggest that the new antimicrobial agent biapenem might be useful for the treatment of polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
TI  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin is the first parenteral streptogramin antibacterial agent, and is a 30:70 (w/w) ratio of 2 semisynthetic pristinamycin derivatives. The combination has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF), drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci, Clostridium perfringens and Peptostreptococcus spp. The combination also has good activity against selected gram-negative respiratory tract pathogens including Moraxella catarrhalis, Legioniella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Quinupristin/dalfopristin has poor activity against E. faecalis. The combination is bactericidal against staphylococci and streptococci, although constitutive erythromycin resistance can affect its activity. As for many other agents, quinupristin/dalfopristin is generally bacteriostatic against E. faecium. In patients with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) or VREF infections participating in prospective emergency-use trials, quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5 mg/kg every 8 or 12 hours achieved clinical or bacteriological success in > or =64% of patients. Emergence of resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin was uncommon (4% of patients) in those with VREF infections. Quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5 mg/kg 8- or 12-hourly also achieved similar clinical success rates to comparator agents in patients with presumed gram-positive complicated skin and skin structure infections or nosocomial pneumonia (administered in combination with aztreoman) in 3 large multicentre randomised trials. Systemic adverse events associated with quinupristin/dalfopristin include gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea), rash and pruritus. Myalgias and arthralgias also occur at an overall incidence of 1.3%, although higher rates (2.5 to 31%) have been reported in patients with multiple comorbidities. Venous events are common if the drug is administered via a peripheral line; however, several management options (e.g. use of central venous access, increased infusion volume) may help to minimise their occurrence. Hyperbilirubinaemia has been documented in 3.1% of quinupristin/dalfopristin recipients versus 1.3% of recipients of comparator agents. Quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibits cytochrome P450 3A4 and therefore has the potential to increase the plasma concentrations of substrates of this enzyme. CONCLUSIONS: Quinupristin/dalfopristin, the first parenteral streptogramin, offers a unique spectrum of activity against multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria. In serious gram-positive infections for which there are other treatment options available, the spectrum of activity and efficacy of quinupristin/ dalfopristin should be weighed against its tolerability and drug interaction profile. However, in VREF or unresponsive MRSA infections, where few proven treatment options exist, quinupristin/dalfopristin should be considered as a treatment of choice for these seriously ill patients.
TI  - [Results of treatment of deep neck abscesses and phlegmons].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Neck, as a structure very closely connected with oral cavity and pharynx, with great number of lymph nodes, (about 2, 3 of all are in the neck), is sometimes a localization of purulent inflammatory process but its incidence is not so high as the incidence of inflammations of surrounding organs and tissue. Deep neck abscesses are localized under the upper fascial layer. They have a serious clinical picture which could be further complicated if inflammation spreads on vessels or neck organs. If the processes spread toward the mediastinum because of the communication space between medial and deep fascial layer with mediastinum, it could be mediastinal inflammation with high mortality. The aim of this study is evaluation of results of treatment in patients with deep neck abscesses and phlegmons treated at Clinic in a ten year period (1988-1997). MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study comprised 21 patients who were treated at the ENT Clinic in Novi Sad during 1988-1997. The group consisted of 5 female and 16 male patients from one to 65 years of age. Sixteen (76.2%) patients were treated with antibiotics in general practice, and 5 were admitted without previous therapy, 8 patients were afebrile, with temperatures between 37-38 degrees C and 5 with fever and high temperature. In 17 patients 5 days passed from onset of symptoms to admittance at the Clinic, and 4 patients had enlarged neck lymph nodes a few months. Unknown primary site of infections were in 13 (61.9%) patients, that means abscesses developed as colliquation of inflammatory changed lymph node. In the rest of 8 patients abscesses developed as: oropharyngeal inflammation (4 patients), foreign body perforation of esophagus, chronic otitis media, neck injury, malignant lymphoma. Lateral side of the neck was the most frequent site of neck abscesses and phlegmon in 16 (76%) patients. Red skin over the abscesses didn't appear in 4 patients. In 2 patients neck emphysema developed: anaerobic inflammation in one patient and esophageal perforation in the second. In a patient with SE over the 50 per hour the length of the abscess was over 7 cm, and in those with SE over 100 per hour, the whole neck inflammed. All patients underwent surgical therapy between 24 to 48 h after admission with incision or excision of the abscesses. Pus was collected for culture during the incision or excision of the abscesses and phlegmon. Bacteria were discovered in specimens taken during the incision in 4 (19%) of patients. Different aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated: Enterococcus, Peptostreptococcus sp, Streptococcus viridans, Clostridium species. Surgery was the basic therapy of neck phlegmons and abscesses. In all patients incision was sutured in the second stage. Only one patient got paralysis of n. accesorius. One patient died with gas gangrene of the neck. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Deep neck abscesses and phlegmons are relatively rare inflammations in spite of high incidence of surrounding tissue inflammations. The most frequent causes are inflammatory changes of lymph nodes. Treatment has to be urgent, because of vital neck structures and communications between deep neck space and mediastinum. We consider that surgery is the basic principle of therapy although we have not had experience with needle aspiration. Antimicrobial agents must be given only parenterally.
TI  - Minimal debridement in the treatment of Fournier's gangrene.
AB  - Scrotal and perineal gangrene of the male genitalia was first described by Fournier in 1883. Treatment of the disease remains surgical despite the availability of modern antibiotics. Many authors advocate a wide debridement of all tissue superficial to the involved fascial layers. We have reviewed our experience of using wide and minimal debridement as the surgical technique of choice. In our retrospective study, nine patients were diagnosed and treated over a 2-year period for Fournier's gangrene. The mean age was 65+/-28 years. Two patients were admitted from chronic care facilities, four were diabetic, and two had taken oral steroids. Five of the nine patients were treated with the technique of minimal tissue debridement. In brief, the scrotum was bivalved along the median raphe, each scrotal sac was drained, and the testicles were exteriorized. Orchiectomy was performed if the testicles were grossly necrotic. Penrose drains were inserted from each scrotal sac to the counterincision at the level of the internal rings. All of the tissue involved was irrigated with betadine and peroxide, after debridement of the necrotic tissue. Broad-spectrum antibiotics along with daily packing were continued for 4 to 6 weeks; at the end of that time the testicles were returned to the scrotum and the skin was loosely reapproximated. Three of the nine patients were treated with wide debridement of all the soft tissue including the fascia. One of the patients displayed gangrene of the entire abdominal wall; he was not a surgical candidate and died 3 days later. The four patients treated with minimal debridement all obtained successful treatment of their fasciitis. However, one died of complications related to a duodenal ulcer. The mean hospital stay was 45+/-10 days. Two of the three patients treated with wide debridement required plastic reconstruction using a skin-muscle flap of the perineum. The remaining patient treated with wide debridement died of complications related to metastatic renal carcinoma. The mean hospital stay of this group was 62+/-12 days. The specific flora included: Bacteroidis fragilis in 87 per cent, Peptostreptococcus and Streptococcus in 75 per cent, Clostridia group, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter and Pseudomonas in 62 per cent, Klebsiella in 50 per cent, Staphylococcus in 37 per cent, and Proteus in 12 per cent of the patients. In the surgical management of Fournier's gangrene, wide drainage with minimal debridement resulted in similar morbidity and shorter hospital stay when compared with extensive debridement.
TI  - In vitro utilization of amylopectin and high-amylose maize (Amylomaize) starch granules by human colonic bacteria.
AB  - It has been well established that a certain amount of ingested starch can escape  digestion in the human small intestine and consequently enters the large intestine, where it may serve as a carbon source for bacterial fermentation. Thirty-eight types of human colonic bacteria were screened for their capacity to utilize soluble starch, gelatinized amylopectin maize starch, and high-amylose maize starch granules by measuring the clear zones on starch agar plates. The six cultures which produced clear zones on amylopectin maize starch- containing plates were selected for further studies for utilization of amylopectin maize starch and high-amylose maize starch granules A (amylose; Sigma) and B (Culture Pro 958N). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used to detect bacterial starch-degrading enzymes. It was demonstrated that Bifidobacterium spp., Bacteroides spp., Fusobacterium spp., and strains of Eubacterium, Clostridium, Streptococcus, and Propionibacterium could hydrolyze the gelatinized amylopectin maize starch, while only Bifidobacterium spp. and Clostridium butyricum could efficiently utilize high-amylose maize starch granules. In fact, C. butyricum and Bifidobacterium spp. had higher specific growth rates in the autoclaved medium containing high-amylose maize starch granules and hydrolyzed 80 and 40% of the amylose, respectively. Starch-degrading enzymes were cell bound on Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides cells and were extracellular for C. butyricum. Active staining for starch-degrading enzymes on SDS-PAGE gels showed that the Bifidobacterium cells produced several starch-degrading enzymes with high relative molecular (M(r)) weights (>160,000), medium-sized relative molecular weights (>66,000), and low relative molecular weights (<66,000). It was concluded that Bifidobacterium spp. and C. butyricum degraded and utilized granules of amylomaize starch.
TI  - Isolation of bacteria from cervical lymph nodes in patients with oral cancer.
AB  - Thirty patients with oral mucosal cancer were studied in relation to oral mucosal damage and bacterial translocation to the regional lymph nodes in the neck. All 30 patients (gingiva 11, tongue 13, cheek mucosa four, oral floor two) underwent extensive, clean-contaminated, head-and-neck surgery (including neck dissection) with free flap reconstruction. A total of 153 lymph nodes was harvested for microbial and histological examination. Viable bacteria were isolated from 70 lymph nodes (45.8%) from 25 patients (83.3%). Bacterial cells in the nodes were detected by scanning electron microscopy. Bacterial translocation was found more often in metastatic nodes (75.0%) than in uninvolved nodes (40.3%) (p = 0.015; chi2 test). Gingival carcinoma yielded 56.4% of bacterial growth in the regional lymph nodes compared to tongue (40.3%), oral floor (40.0%) and cheek mucosa (37.5%). As the gingival carcinoma group includes more T4 cases (11/11; 100%) than the other three groups (7/19; 36.8%), bacterial translocation in uninvolved nodes could be caused by the size and invasion of the primary oral tumor. Oral streptococci (Streptococcus intermedius, Strep. constellatus, Strep. oralis, Strep. mitis, Strep. sanguis, Strep. salivarius) were the most common isolates. Aerobic enteric bacteria (Enterococcus, Escherichia, Klebsiella etc.) were also found in the lymph nodes. Among the anaerobic bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from 12 patients. Damaged oral mucosa in patients with oral cancer might allow the new bacterial colonization on the surface and subsequently drain the bacteria into the regional lymph nodes as well as the general circulation.
TI  - beta-Hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms in apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis.
AB  - Thirteen teeth with necrotic pulps and apical periodontitis and nine severe periodontal pockets were cultured for presence of beta-hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms. Samples were dispersed and plated on two non-selective and one selective growth media and incubated anaerobically and in 10% CO2 in air. A total of 59 beta-hemolytic colonies were purified and identified. Eight beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates were obtained from three of the severe marginal periodontitis sites. All were identified as belonging to the Streptococcus sanguis group. No beta-hemolytic streptococci were detected in apical periodontitis samples. Twenty obligately anaerobic isolates were detected, all of which were known periodontal and endodontic pathogens. Isolates from apical periodontitis sites were identified as Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actionomyces odontolyticus and Peptostreptococcus micros, while severe marginal periodontal sites contained the same species with the addition of Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces meyeri. Of 19 staphylococci and micrococci, Staphylococcus epidermidis was the predominant isolate in both apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis sites. However, less commonly known organisms such as Staphylococcus cohnii and Micrococcus sp. were identified in severe marginal periodontitis sites. The isolation of Bacillus sp. (12 isolates) in one severe marginal periodontitis and two apical periodontitis subjects was especially interesting, warranting consideration of this organism as a legitimate isolate and potential pathogen in oral disease.
TI  - [In vitro bactericidal activities of new oral penem, faropenem against the various clinical isolates].
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of faropenem (FRPM) more compared with those of various oral beta-lactams against 15 isolates each of 6 species of microorganism. FRPM possessed potent in vitro antibacterial activity against both aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria tested. FRPM showed the same activity as new oral cephems such as cefdinir, cefditoren and cefcapene against all Gram-negative bacteria, but K. pneumoniae strains were less susceptible. The MBC of FRPM against S. pneumoniae and the other strains tested equal and were within 1 dilution the MIC of that, respectively. These results suggest that FRPM has excellent in vitro bactericidal activity against clinical isolates and is a clinically useful for the chemotherapy of bacterial infections.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between July 1996 and June 1997].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained during period from July 1996 to June 1997. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. A total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). From primary infections 162 strains were isolated, and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. From primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was the highest. In postoperative infections, the majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were Enterococcus avium. The isolation rate of Staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of Enterococcus spp. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like B. fragilis group and of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. We found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither Staphylacoccus aureus nor Enterococcus spp.; however, the MIC of arbekacin for one of strains of S. aureus was 100 micrograms/ml. Both the MIC90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against P. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. Compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.
TI  - Infection-stimulated infraosseus inflammation and bone destruction is increased in P-/E-selectin knockout mice.
AB  - Infections of the dental pulp commonly result in infraosseus inflammation and bone destruction. However, the role of phagocytic leucocytes in the pathogenesis of pulpal infections has been uncertain. In this work we used P/E-/- selectin-deficient mice, which lack rolling adhesion of leucocytes to endothelium and mimic the human syndrome, leucocyte adhesion deficiency II (LAD-II), to test the hypothesis that phagocytic leucocytes protect against pulpal infection and subsequent periapical infraosseus bone resorption. P/E-/- mice and P/E+/+ wild-type controls were subjected to surgical pulp exposure, and both groups were infected with a mixture of pulpal pathogens including Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros and Streptococcus intermedius. Animals were killed after 20 days, and the extent of infraosseus bone destruction was quantified by histomorphometry. In two separate experiments, P/E-/- mice had significantly greater bone resorption than P/E+/+ controls. The increased bone destruction correlated with a twofold decrease in polymorphonuclear (PMN) infiltration into periapical inflammatory tissues of P/E-/- mice. P/E-/- mice had higher tissue levels of the bone resorptive cytokine, interleukin (IL)-1alpha. Tissue levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) were all higher in P/E-/- mice, but the increases were not statistically significant. Only IL-12 was higher in P/E+/+ mice, possibly reflecting a greater number of infiltrating monocytes in wild-type mice. These findings demonstrate that phagocytic leucocytes are protective in this model, and suggest that elevated expression of inflammatory cytokines is responsible for the observed bone destruction.
TI  - Cervical necrotizing fasciitis: 10 years' experience at a single institution.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical and microbiologic characteristics, modalities of  treatment and outcome of patients with cervical necrotizing fasciitis admitted to our institution. DESIGN: Retrospective clinical investigation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the charts of 20 consecutive patients hospitalized in our Intensive Care Unit between January 1987 and June 1998 with the diagnosis of cervical necrotizing fasciitis. RESULTS: All the patients required mechanical ventilation. Four of them had mediastinal involvement. The organisms most commonly implicated included Streptococcus, Prevotella, and Peptostreptococcus species. Patients with adequate surgery had a better outcome than those with inadequate surgical procedures. Because no evidence-based recommendations exist in the field of head and neck infections, hyperbaric oxygen was not used as adjunctive therapy. Of the 20 patients, 3 (15 %) died. CONCLUSION: The main finding of this study is that prompt, rather than delayed, surgical debridement correlates with a decrease in morbidity and mortality. However, no definite conclusion is justified due to the relatively small number of patients. Immediate radical debridement, and early redebridement if needed, appropriate antibiotics and intensive care support are critical in controlling these life-threatening infections.
TI  - [Trovafloxacin in gynecology].
AB  - Presence of microorganisms in the female lower genital tract (LGT) in concentrations that modify the established normal equilibrium produce different symptoms that make necessary to consult the gynecologist. It is currently accepted that infections of the LGT are due to microorganisms that are normally integrating the internal flora, except for the erroneously called "sexually transmitted diseases" that are caused by external microorganisms. This means that all those microorganisms usually present without causing any disease manifestations may, under certain circumstances and determined concentrations, originate or be associated to infections. Lactobacillus sp. and Corynebacterium sp. are normally the most frequent microorganisms in the vagina together with Streptococcus (aerobe), Streptococcus agalactiae and others like Enterococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides sp., Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Fusobacterium, Escherichia coli. Different antibiotic schemes are proposed for different infections (bacterial vaginosis, gonococcia, chlamydial infections, pelvic inflammatory disease). They are discussed in different sections. Trovafloxacin has shown to be effective in the treatment of infections due to Chlamydia with excellent clinical results and a good tolerance. It was effective as single dose therapy in the treatment of acute gonococcia with therapeutic success in 99% of the treated patients. New fluoroquinolones are also effective in the treatment of infections due to aerobial pathogens. The use of trovafloxacin in the treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease would present great advantages: on one hand, it would cover the wide spectrum of microorganisms responsible for the infection and, on the other, would permit an early switch to oral therapy once the acute phase is over.
TI  - Bacteremia after dental treatment in mentally handicapped people.
AB  - Bacteremia may occur after disruption of the oral mucous membrane, particularly after dental treatment. 18 mentally handicapped patients who underwent dental treatment with general anesthesia were included in our study. None of the patients had general illnesses or received antibiotic protection. From each patient several blood samples were drawn aseptically during dental treatment and cultured. The majority of aerobic bacteria recovered belonged to Streptococcus sp and Gemella sp., anaerobic bacteria mainly belonged to Porphyromonas gingivalis and Peptostreptococcus sp. Resistance of the isolated bacteria to penicillin as well as to oxacillin, erythromycin and Co-trimoxazole was substantial. The highest resistance rate could be shown against fucidic acid.
TI  - Effects of hydrogen peroxide on growth and selected properties of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - In this study we first evaluated the effects of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on growth and selected properties of Porphyromonas gingivalis, and compared them with those obtained by a reducing agent (cysteine). The growth of P. gingivalis was only moderately affected when H2O2 was added at concentrations up to 30 mM in a complex culture medium. However, when a defined basal medium was used, H2O2 at a concentration of 3 mM completely inhibited growth of P. gingivalis. Incorporation of cysteine at concentrations up to 30 mM in both media had no effect on growth. The effects of H2O2 and cysteine on cell-associated hemagglutinating and Arg-gingipain activities were evaluated using bacteria grown in the complex culture medium. Both activities were strongly decreased when H2O2 was added in the assay mixtures. This inhibitory effect of H2O2 was reversible. On the other hand, including cysteine in the assay mixtures increased both activities. H2O2 and cysteine had no effect on the expression of heat shock protein (HSP)-68 and HSP-75 by P. gingivalis, as determined by SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting analysis. In the second part of the study, we tested whether growth of selected oral bacterial species may modify the oxidation-reduction potential (Eh) of the environment. It was found that certain species were able to either decrease (P. gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Streptococcus mutans) or increase (Streptococcus sanguis) the Eh of the medium. Our study provides evidence that an oxidizing agent such as H2O2 may affect the biology of P. gingivalis. Moreover, growth of some members of the oral microflora can generate oxidizing and reducing conditions, and thus potentially influence the ecology of subgingival sites by affecting strictly anaerobic bacteria such as P. gingivalis.
TI  - Differential induction of colitis and gastritis in HLA-B27 transgenic rats selectively colonized with Bacteroides vulgatus or Escherichia coli.
AB  - Resident bacteria play an important role in initiating and perpetuating gastrointestinal inflammation. We previously demonstrated that six commensal bacteria including Bacteroides vulgatus caused more aggressive colitis and gastritis in HLA-B27 transgenic rats than did the other five bacteria without B. vulgatus. This study compared the degree of gastrointestinal inflammation in gnotobiotic HLA-B27 transgenic rats monoassociated with either B. vulgatus or Escherichia coli. Gnotobiotic transgenic rats raised in Trexler isolators were selectively colonized with either B. vulgatus or E. coli. Control rats were either germfree or colonized with six common commensal bacteria (Streptococcus faecium, E. coli, Streptococcus avium, Eubacterium contortum, Peptostreptococcus productus, and B. vulgatus [DESEP-B]). After 1 month, all the rats were killed and tissues were prepared for histologic and biochemical evaluation. Colitis induced by B. vulgatus monoassociation was almost equal to that in DESEP-B-colonized rats and was significantly more severe than E. coli-induced colitis, which was absent by histological testing and mild by colonic myeloperoxidase and interleukin-1beta concentration determinations. However, gastritis was detectable only in DESEP-B-associated rats. These studies suggest that not all resident bacteria have equal proinflammatory capabilities, since B. vulgatus alone is more active than E. coli alone in inducing colitis, and that colitis and gastritis result from different luminal bacterial stimuli.
TI  - Interference by aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in children with recurrent group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal tonsillitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the frequency of recovery of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with interfering capability of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) in the tonsils of children with and without a history of recurrent GABHS pharyngotonsillitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tonsillar cultures were taken from a group of 20 children with and 20 without history of recurrent GABHS pharyngotonsillitis. RESULTS: Eleven aerobic and anaerobic isolates with interfering capability with GABHS were recovered from 6 (30%) of the 20 children with recurrent GABHS, and 40 such organisms were isolated from 17 (85%) of the 20 without recurrences (P<.01). The interfering organisms included aerobic (alpha-hemolytic and nonhemolytic streptococci) and anaerobic organisms (Prevotella and Peptostreptococcus species). CONCLUSIONS: The tonsils of children with a history of recurrent GABHS infection contain fewer aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with interfering capability of GABHS than those without the history of recurrent GABHS infection. The presence of these interfering bacteria may play a role in preventing GABHS infection.
TI  - Prevalence of corynebacterial 16S rRNA sequences in patients with bacterial and "nonbacterial" prostatitis.
AB  - The etiology of chronic prostatitis syndromes in men is controversial, particularly when positive cultures for established uropathogens are lacking. Although identification of bacteria in prostatic fluid has relied on cultivation and microscopy, most microorganisms in the environment, including some human pathogens, are resistant to cultivation. We report here on an rRNA-based molecular phylogenetic approach to the identification of bacteria in prostate fluid from prostatitis patients. Positive bacterial signals were seen for 65% of patients with chronic prostatitis overall. Seven of 11 patients with bacterial signals but none of 6 patients without bacterial signals were cured with antibiotic-based therapy. Results indicate the occurrence in the prostate fluid of a wide spectrum of bacterial species representing several genera. Most rRNA genes were closely related to those of species belonging to the genera Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Streptococcus, and Escherichia. Unexpectedly, a wide diversity of Corynebacterium species was found in high proportion compared to the proportions of other bacterial species found. A subset of these 16S rRNA sequences represent those of undescribed species on the basis of their positions in phylogenetic trees. These uncharacterized organisms were not detected in control samples, suggesting that the organisms have a role in the disease or are the consequence of the disease. These studies show that microorganisms associated with prostatitis generally occur as complex microbial communities that differ between patients. The results also indicate that microbial communities distinct from those associated with prostatitis may occur at low levels in normal prostatic fluid.
TI  - Bacterial populations contaminating the upper gut in patients with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndrome.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndrome (SIBOS) is characterized by an abnormally high bacterial population level in the upper gut, exceeding 10(5) organisms/ml (5 log colony-forming unit (CFU)/ml). To understand its origin and select an appropriate antibiotic treatment, we have analyzed the bacterial populations contaminating the upper gut in SIBOS patients. METHODS: Jejunal samples of 63 consecutive patients with diarrhea or malabsorption and conditions predisposing to SIBOS were cultured and antibiotic sensitivities determined. RESULTS: Concentrations of total, microaerophilic, and anaerobic bacteria were confirmed in 55 patients with SIBOS (mean +/- SE) 7.6 +/- 0.8, 7.4 +/- 0.9, and 6.1 +/- 0.7 log CFU/ml, respectively. Mean number of bacterial genera was 4.6 +/- 0.8. The main bacteria recovered were (mean +/- SE log CFU/ml) Streptococcus (71%; 6.4 +/- 0.8), Escherichia coli (69%; 7.2 +/- 0.9), Staphylococcus (25%; 6.2 +/- 0.6), Micrococcus (22%; 6.0 +/- 0.7), Klebsiella (20%; 7.1 +/- 0.8), Proteus (11%; 6.1 +/- 0.8) for microaerophilic bacteria, and Lactobacillus (75%; 6.1 +/- 1.1), Bacteroides (29%; 6.9 +/- 1.3), Clostridium (25%; 5.5 +/- 1.0), Veillonella (25%; 5.3 +/- 0.7), Fusobacterium (13%; 4.8 +/- 0.5), and Peptostreptococcus (13%; 6.1 +/- 0.7) for anaerobic bacteria. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefoxitin were efficient on >90% of strains. CONCLUSIONS: Contaminating flora isolated in SIBOS include commonly identified oropharyngeal and colonic flora, but these occur in SIBOS at different levels from those usually found in their original location. These data may hopefully serve as a starting point to further therapeutic controlled studies.
TI  - In vitro activities of pazufloxacin, a novel injectable quinolone, against bacteria causing infections in obstetric and gynecological patients.
AB  - T-3762 is an injectable new quinolone with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. Pazufloxacin (T-3761) is an active form of T-3762. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of pazufloxacin for 50% of the clinical isolates tested were 3.13 microg/ml for Streptococcus agalactiae, 6.25 microg/ml for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.025 microg/ml for Escherichia coli, 0.78 microg/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 6.25 microg/ml for Peptostreptococcus magnus, 6.25 microg/ml for Bacteroides fragilis and 12.5 microg/ml for Prevotella bivia. The MICs of T-3762 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 3.13 microg/ml for S. agalactiae, 6.25 microg/ml for G. vaginalis, 0.10 microg/ml for E. coli, 12.5 microg/ml for P. aeruginosa, 25 microg/ml for P. magnus, 12.5 microg/ml for B. fragilis and 25 microg/ml for P. bivia. The results of this study suggest that, subject to confirmation by clinical trials, T-3762, in combination with an agent with reliable activity against anaerobic bacteria, is suitable as an empirical therapy of patients with obstetric and gynecological infections.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial properties of pexiganan, an analog of magainin.
AB  - Pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid antimicrobial peptide, is an analog of the magainin peptides isolated from the skin of the African clawed frog. Pexiganan exhibited in vitro broad-spectrum antibacterial activity when it was tested against 3,109 clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative, anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. The pexiganan MIC at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (MIC90) was 32 micrograms/ml or less for Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus faecium, Corynebacterium spp., Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., Stenotrophomonas spp., certain species of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroides spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., and Propionibacterium spp. Comparison of the MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of pexiganan for 143 isolates representing 32 species demonstrated that for 92% of the isolates tested, MBCs were the same or within 1 twofold difference of the MICs, consistent with a bactericidal mechanism of action. Killing curve analysis showed that pexiganan killed Pseudomonas aeruginosa rapidly, with 10(6) organisms/ml eliminated within 20 min of treatment with 16 micrograms of pexiganan per ml. No evidence of cross-resistance to a number of other antibiotic classes was observed, as determined by the equivalence of the MIC50s and the MIC90s of pexiganan for strains resistant to oxacillin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, imipenem, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and clindamicin versus those for strains susceptible to these antimicrobial agents. Attempts to generate resistance in several bacterial species through repeated passage with subinhibitory concentrations of pexiganan were unsuccessful. In conclusion, pexiganan exhibits properties in vitro which make it an attractive candidate for development as a topical antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Microbiota of successful osseointegrated dental implants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The long-term survival of dental implants depends, in part, on control of bacterial infection in the peri-implant region. Periodontal pathogens colonized implants symptomatic through infection, whereas the microbiota of successful implants was similar to that of periodontal health. This study examined the impact on the peri-implant microbiota of crown restorations; implant type; length of time of loading; history of implant or periodontal infections; and whether implants replaced single or multiple teeth. It was of particular interest to evaluate implant colonization by species in a newly described red complex of periodontal pathogens, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Bacteroides forsythus. METHODS: This study sampled 43 partially edentulous subjects with successfully osseointegrated titanium root-form dental implants. Eighty-one (81) non-submerged and 20 submerged asymptomatic implants, 83 crowned, and 36 uncrowned teeth were sampled from peri-implant or subgingival sites. The microbiota of samples was evaluated using whole genomic DNA probes in a checkerboard assay to 23 subgingival species. RESULTS: Implants were colonized principally by oral streptococci, capnocytophagae, Veillonella parvula, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The periodontal species, P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, and Campylobacter rectus were detected in a few subjects. The microbiota around crowned implants and crowned teeth was similar. Streptococcus oralis, P. intermedia, and Selenomonas noxia were elevated in samples from uncrowned teeth compared to crowned teeth and implants. Microbial complexity increased as loading time increased, but colonization by periodontal pathogens, including red complex species, was higher in subjects with previous periodontal disease. No differences were observed in the microbiota of 1- and 2-stage implants, or between implants supporting single or multiple restorations. CONCLUSIONS: While presence of crowns had only a minor impact on the peri-implant microbiota, microbial changes were observed the longer the implants had been in function and in those patients with a history of periodontal or peri-implant infections. A history of periodontitis had a greater impact on the peri-implant microbiota than implant loading time. The major influence on the peri-implant microbiota was, however, the microbiota on remaining teeth. P. gingivalis and B. forsythus, red complex periodontal pathogens, colonized several implants, although all implants were successfully osseointegrated.
TI  - The microbiota of periodontal pockets with different depths in therapy-resistant  periodontitis.
AB  - This study presents the composition of the cultivable microbiota colonising periodontal pockets of different depths among 2 patient-groups classified as non-responsive (NR-group; 11 participants) or responsive (R-group; 10 participants) to periodontal treatment. Microbiological samples from three types of pocket (< 4 mm deep A-samples; 4-5 mm B-samples; > 5 mm C-samples) were analysed by cultural methods for putative periodontitis pathogens, microbial groups constituting > or = 5% of the total cultivable flora and opportunistic pathogens. Actinomyces naeslundii, A. israelii, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium spp, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Peptostreptococcus micros, anaerobic streptococci and facultative anaerobic streptococci were most prevalent. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Staphylococcus aureus, enteric rods and yeasts were less prevalent. The periodontitis pathogens Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium spp, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Peptostreptococcus micros constituted together (on average) < or = 23% of the viable counts in the A- and B-samples of both patient groups and in the C-samples of the R-group. In the C-samples of the NR-group their mean counts were 45%. Correlations were found between smoking habits and the five pathogens in the C-samples and in pooled pocket depth samples. The results show that groups of periodontopathogens should be considered a causal factor in therapy-resistant periodontitis. Further, smoking and deep pockets can enhance a shift in the balance of the subgingival microflora predisposing a site to disease and a susceptible host may be the pre-requisite to therapy-resistant periodontitis.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological characteristics of smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  - Cigarette smoking is a potential risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. The objective of this study was to compare the microbial profile of smokers and non-smokers in a group of patients with early onset periodontitis. The study population consisted of 60 healthy individuals, 40 males and 20 females aged 22 to 35 yr, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. Thirty patients were smokers (30.9 cigarettes/d) and 30 non-smokers. Smokers had a higher proportion of deep pockets (PD >5 mm), especially in the maxilla anterior and premolar regions (p < 0.001) and presented a significantly greater mean probing depth and attachment loss (p <0.05) in diseased sites and a significantly greater alveolar bone loss (p <0.01) compared to non-smokers. Two pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. Samples were collected from the deepest periodontal pockets of each quadrant. The samples were cultured anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. Smokers harboured a greater number of bacteria in total. Analysis of bacterial counts using the ANOVA (Mann-Whitney U-test) showed that Staphylococcus aureus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Campylobacter concisus, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides forsythus, C. gracilis, C. rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Selenomonas sputigena, Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus were found in significantly higher numbers and more frequently in smokers while Streptococcus intermedius, A. naeslundii, A. israelii and Eubacterium lentum were detected more frequently and in significantly higher proportions in non-smokers. The isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora such as E. coli, C. albicans, A. fumigatus and S. aureus in smokers' microbiota underscores the importance of the host that is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.
TI  - Infections associated with dental procedures in total hip arthroplasty.
AB  - Dental procedures may lead to a transient bacteraemia lasting for up to 30 minutes. Of the numerous cases of total hip arthroplasty (THA) reported which have been infected from haematogenous sources, dental procedures have been involved only infrequently. We reviewed the records of 2973 patients after THA. Of the late infections identified in 52 patients, three (6%) were strongly associated with a dental procedure. Infection was diagnosed by culture from the affected joint; Streptococcus viridans was identified in two cases and Peptostreptococcus in one. One patient had diabetes mellitus and another rheumatoid arthritis, both conditions predisposing to infection. The dental operations all lasted for more than 45 minutes and no patient received perioperative antibiotics. Infection of a THA after dental procedures is more common than has been previously suspected. Patients with systemic disease, or who are undergoing extensive procedures, should be considered for prophylactic antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of axillary hidradenitis suppurativa.
AB  - A retrospective review of the microbiological and clinical data of 17 specimens obtained from axillary hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) over a period of 6 years was undertaken to study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of this condition. A total of 42 bacterial isolates (2.5 per specimen) were obtained, 12 aerobic or facultative (0.7 per specimen) and 30 anaerobic or micro-aerophilic (1.8 per specimen). Aerobic and facultative bacteria only were isolated in six (35%) cases, anaerobic bacteria only in seven (41%) and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in four (24%). The predominant aerobic bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (six isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes (three) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (two). The most frequently isolated anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (10), Prevotella spp. (seven), micro-aerophilic streptococci (four), Fusobacterium spp. (three) and Bacteroides spp. sensu stricto (three). This study highlights the polymicrobial nature and predominance of anaerobic bacteria in axillary HS and the need for antimicrobial thereby to reflect this.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of lung abscess diagnosed by transtracheal aspiration].
AB  - We have diagnosed lung abscess according to findings of infiltration with cavity  formation on chest X-ray and/or CT-scan and pathogens isolated from transtracheal aspirates. We evaluated the clinical features of 20 patients with lung abscess (18 males and 2 females, mean age; 54.3 years). Diabetus mellitus and periodontal diseases were prominent underlying diseases in patients with lung abscess. Cough was complained in 13 patients, chest or back pain in 9, purulent sputum in 8 and hemosputum in 5 when the patients admitted to our hospital. A temperature higher than 38 degrees C was present in 12 patients but temperature les than 37 degrees C in 2. Multiple microorganisms were cultured from TTA in 15 patients. A mean of 2.7 bacterial species per patient was isolated, aerobes alone being isolated in 2 patients, anaerobes alone in 3, and mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates in 10. Seventeen strains of aerobes and 35 of anaerobes were isolated. Major pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus intermedius and other in aerobes, and Peptostreptococcus micros, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Prevotella melaninogenica and others in anaerobes. Abnormality of chest X-ray was located on the right upper lobe in 6 patients, the right lower lobe in 6, the left upper lobe in 6, the left lower lobe in 4 and the right middle lobe in 1. All patients were cured only by treatment of antimicrobial agents, but cavity formation on chest X-ray remained in 4 patients after the treatment.
TI  - Microbiologic characteristics of persistent otitis media.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the pathogens isolated from children with acute otitis media who did not respond to antimicrobial drug therapy. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of cultures obtained by tympanocentesis from 46 children. RESULTS: Organisms were recovered from 34 children (74%), and 43 isolates were recovered from these individuals. The organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae (16 isolates), Haemophilus influenzae non-type b (12 isolates), Moraxella catarrhalis (5 isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes (5 isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (3 isolates), and Peptostreptococcus species (2 isolates). Resistance to the antimicrobial agent used was found in 27 (63%) of 43 isolates found in 22 patients (48%). Of patients who did not respond to amoxicillin therapy, H influenzae predominated. Streptococcus pneumoniae was recovered from 5 (56%) of 9 of those who did not respond to trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole therapy, 4 (44%) of 9 patients after azithromycin therapy, 3 (25%) of 12 patients after amoxicillin therapy, and 2 (40%) of 5 patients after cefixime therapy. Streptococcus pyogenes was recovered from 2 (40%) of 5 patients after trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole therapy and from 2 (40%) of 5 patients after cefixime therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The data illustrate the relation between resistance to antimicrobial drug therapy and failure of patients with otitis media to improve. They also highlight the importance of diagnostic tympanocentesis in establishing the presence of resistant microorganisms.
TI  - [Bacterial flora in pharyngitis and tonsillitis].
AB  - The aim of the study was a microbiological analysis of pharyngeal swabs obtained  from 158 patients with the diagnosis of pharyngitis and purulent exudates from the tonsillar crypts of 10 patients treated for chronic purulent tonsillitis. Beta haemolytic streptococci groups A, B, C and G were isolated from 30% of the patients. The most frequently isolated were Streptococcus pyogenes--12% of patients and Streptococcus group C--10.7%. Other streptococci were isolated less frequently: Streptococcus group B--44%, group G--2.5%. The majority of isolated bacteria belonged to potential pathogenic flora (70% patients). Staphylococcus aureus (37%) and Haemophilus spp. (36%) were isolated most frequently. Other bacteria were isolated in the following sequence: Moraxella catarrhalis--22%, Streptococcus pneumoniae--17% and Gram-negative rods from the Enterobacteriaceae family--6%. One case of Plaut-Vincent tonsillitis was diagnosed. Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated from purulent exudates from the tonsillar crypts of 10 patients treated for chronic purulent tonsillitis. The isolated anaerobic bacteria belonged to genus of Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus and Gemella.
TI  - Microbiology of liver and spleen abscesses.
AB  - To study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of liver and spleen abscesses and correlate the results with predisposing factors, potential causes and routes of infection, clinical and laboratory data of 48 patients with liver abscesses and 29 with spleen abscesses treated between 1970 and 1990 were reviewed retrospectively. In liver abscesses, a total of 116 isolates (2.4 isolates/specimen) was obtained; 43 were aerobic and facultative species (0.9 isolates/specimen) and 73 were anaerobic species or microaerophilic streptococci (1.5 isolates/specimen). Aerobic bacteria only were isolated from 12 (25%) abscesses, anaerobic bacteria only from eight (17%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 28 (58%); polymicrobial infection was present in 38 (79%). The predominant aerobic and facultative isolates were Escherichia coli (11 isolates), Streptococcus group D (8), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5) and Staphylococcus aureus (4). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (18 isolates), Bacteroides spp. (13), Fusobacterium spp. (10), Clostridium spp. (10) and Prevotella spp. (4). There were 12 isolates of micro-aerophilic streptococci. S. aureus and beta-haemolytic streptococci were associated with trauma; Streptococcus group D, K. pneumoniae and Clostridium spp. with biliary disease; and Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. with colonic disease. In splenic abscesses, a total of 56 isolates (1.9 isolates/specimen) was obtained; 23 were aerobic and facultative species (0.8 isolates/specimen), 31 were anaerobic species or micro-aerophilic streptococci (1.1 isolates/specimen) and two were Candida albicans. Aerobic bacteria only were isolated from nine (31%) abscesses, anaerobic bacteria from eight (28%), mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 10 (34%) and C. albicans in two (7%); polymicrobial infection was present in 16 (55%). The predominant aerobic and facultative isolates were E. coli (5 isolates), Proteus mirabilis (3), Streptococcus group D (3), K. pneumoniae (3) and S. aureus (4). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (11 isolates), Bacteroides spp. (5), Fusobacterium spp. (3) and Clostridium spp. (3). S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and Streptococcus group D were associated with endocarditis, E. coli with urinary tract and abdominal infection, Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. with abdominal infection and Fusobacterium spp. with respiratory infection.
TI  - Evaluation of the Bactericidal Activity on Oral Organisms of the Nd-YAP Laser In  Vitro.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of a pulsed fibre-optic Nd-YAP laser on various strains of oral bacteria: Prevotella nigrescens, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus (i), Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Peptostreptococcus micros (i) was evaluated. A 200-mum optical fibre was placed in Eppendorf tubes containing the different bacterial suspensions. At an energy of 170 mJ/30 Hz, 351 pulses of 150 mus were sufficient to kill the most resistant bacteria (i). The exposure time was 28 s. The temperature rise caused by the shots were measured in vitro at the surface of the roots of two groups of 10 single-rooted teeth. One group received 350 pulses; for the other the preparation time was fixed at 28 s. The temperature rose by 25.66 degrees C for the first group and 25.25 degrees C for the second.
TI  - Recovery of anaerobic bacteria from a post-traumatic nasal septal abscess. A report of two cases.
AB  - This report presents 2 children (boys, 11 and 9 years old) who had post-traumatic nasal septal abscesses. Cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria revealed Peptostreptococcuus magnus and a beta-lactamase-producing Prevotella intermedia in the first patient, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Streptococcus intermedius, and Prevotella melaninogenica in the second patient. Anaerobic bacteria may play a role in nasal septal abscesses.
TI  - Microorganisms in closed periapical lesions.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the microorganisms of strictly selected closed periapical lesions associated with both refractory endodontic therapy and pulpal calcification. Definitive criteria were established that assured complete clinical isolation of the periapical lesion from the oral and periodontal environment. A total of 13 criteria-referenced lesions were selected from 70 patients with endodontic surgical indications. A well controlled culturing method was used in all cases and samples were taken by one clinician at three separate sites during each surgery. Samples taken at the surgical window and within the body of the lesion served as controls, whilst a third sample was taken at the apex. In all 13 cases, samples taken from the apex yielded microorganisms comprising 63.6% obligate anaerobes and 36.4% facultative anaerobes. Prevalence of the isolated species was 31.8% for Actinomyces sp., 22.7% Propionibacterium sp., 18.2% Streptococcus sp., 13.6% Staphlyococcus sp., 4.6% Porphyromonas gingivalis, 4.6% Peptostreptococcus micros and 4.6% Gram-negative enterics. The results of this investigation indicate that closed periapical lesions associated with calcified teeth or those resistant to root canal treatment harbour bacteria. The inability to eradicate all root canal microorganisms during root canal treatment, along with anatomical factors, may allow further bacterial colonization of the root apex and surrounding periapical tissues, and consequently prevent healing.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of infection after trauma.
AB  - Clinical and laboratory data from 1973 to 1988 were retrospectively reviewed to study the microbiology of infection following trauma. A total of 368 specimens obtained from 340 trauma patients showed bacterial growth. The traumas included lacerations (163), blunt trauma (76), penetrating trauma (65), bites (20), and open fractures (10). Anaerobic bacteria only were isolated in 119 (32%) specimens, aerobic bacteria only in 58 (16%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 191 (52%). A total of 444 anaerobic (1.2 isolates per specimen) and 267 aerobic or facultative (0.7 per specimen) were recovered. The predominant anaerobic bacteria included Bacteroides fragilis group (119 isolates), Peptostreptococcus spp (113), Clostridium spp (78), Prevotella spp (58), and Fusobacterium spp (23). The predominant aerobic bacteria included Escherichia coli (83), Staphylococcus aureus (61), Streptococcus pyogenes (27), Streptococcus group D (16), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (16). The types of infections included abscesses (109), bacteremia (32), bites (13), empyema (10), osteomyelitis (21), peritonitis (52), thrombophlebitis (12), and wounds (116, including posttraumatic wounds, cellulitis, stump wound, decubitus ulcers, myositis, and fasciitis). S. aureus was isolated at all sites. However, organisms of the oropharyngeal flora predominated in infections that originated from that location (ie, head and neck wounds, and abscesses or bites), and those of the gastrointestinal flora predominated in infections that originated from that site (ie, peritonitis, abdominal abscesses, decubitus ulcers). This study showed the polymicrobial nature of many infections that follow trauma.
TI  - Sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  - The microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. Anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). There were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and 12 anaerobic. The predominant aerobic isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). The predominant anaerobes were Prevotella sp. (5), Peptostreptococcus sp. (4), Fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and Bacteroides fragilis (1). Beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. Organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven instances. This study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.
TI  - Phenotypic and phylogenetic characterization of ruminal tannin-tolerant bacteria.
AB  - The 16S rRNA sequences and selected phenotypic characteristics were determined for six recently isolated bacteria that can tolerate high levels of hydrolyzable and condensed tannins. Bacteria were isolated from the ruminal contents of animals in different geographic locations, including Sardinian sheep (Ovis aries), Honduran and Colombian goats (Capra hircus), white-tail deer (Odocoileus virginianus) from upstate New York, and Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) from Oregon. Nearly complete sequences of the small-subunit rRNA genes, which were obtained by PCR amplification, cloning, and sequencing, were used for phylogenetic characterization. Comparisons of the 16S rRNA of the six isolates showed that four of the isolates were members of the genus Streptococcus and were most closely related to ruminal strains of Streptococcus bovis and the recently described organism Streptococcus gallolyticus. One of the other isolates, a gram-positive rod, clustered with the clostridia in the low-G+C-content group of gram-positive bacteria. The sixth isolate, a gram-negative rod, was a member of the family Enterobacteriaceae in the gamma subdivision of the class Proteobacteria. None of the 16S rRNA sequences of the tannin-tolerant bacteria examined was identical to the sequence of any previously described microorganism or to the sequence of any of the other organisms examined in this study. Three phylogenetically distinct groups of ruminal bacteria were isolated from four species of ruminants in Europe, North America, and South America. The presence of tannin-tolerant bacteria is not restricted by climate, geography, or host animal, although attempts to isolate tannin-tolerant bacteria from cows on low-tannin diets failed.
TI  - In vitro activities of E1101, a novel oral cephalosporin, against bacteria causing infections in obstetric and gynecological patients.
AB  - E1101 is a new oral cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. It inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli and Peptostreptococcus magnus at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. E1101 was the most active agent against S. agalactiae and E. coli. Since none of the compounds was sufficiently active against the Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella bivia isolates, they are not appropriate in the treatment of patients with infections caused by these organisms. The results of this study suggest that, subject to confirmation by clinical trials, E1101, in combination with an agent with reliable activity against anaerobic bacteria, is suitable as empirical therapy of patients with obstetric and gynecological infections.
TI  - Oral microbiota in smokers and non-smokers in natural and experimentally-induced  gingivitis.
AB  - The present study primarily aimed at investigating the oral microbiota in smokers and non-smokers with established gingivitis and monitoring its composition during experimental gingivitis. Secondly, it aimed at examining whether the composition of the microbiota is associated with different levels of gingival inflammation during this experimental gingivitis trial. For this purpose, 25 non-dental university students with gingivitis were recruited. 11 subjects were smokers and 14 were non-smokers. After achieving gingival health, they entered a 14-day experimental gingivitis trial. Plaque and bleeding were assessed before entering into the study (intake), at day 0, day 5 and at day 14 of the experiment. Microbiological samples from mucosal sites and dental plaque (taken at intake, day 0, and day 14) were analysed for the presence of Actinomyces species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter rectus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Streptococcus species. At day 14 of the experimental period, the level of plaque formation was not different between smokers and non-smokers, but bleeding scores were lower in smokers than in non-smokers (15% and 30% respectively, p=0.01). The change from natural gingivitis to a state of gingival health and a subsequent change from gingival health to experimentally induced gingivitis was accompanied by quantitative alterations in the cultivable microbiota in both groups. Changes were most prominent in the transition from gingival health to experimental gingivitis and were found in dental plaque for Actinomyces species, C. rectus, F. nucleatum, and P. intermedia. Within the group of non-smokers, a distinction was made between subjects with a 'weak' or 'strong' inflammatory response. No relationship with a single bacterial species could be established which would likely explain the differences in levels of inflammation. It is concluded that differences in response to experimental gingivitis are not caused by major differences in the composition of the oral microbiota.
TI  - Subgingival microbial profile of Papillon-Lefevre patients assessed by DNA-probes.
AB  - The prevalence of 18 selected bacterial species was assessed by means of "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridisation in a group of 12 Saudi-Arabian adolescents with Papillon-Lefevre syndrome. A total of 36 tooth sites were investigated. The patients exhibited severe periodontal disease with deep pockets. All 12 patients harboured the putative bacterial pathogens P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, P. micros and S. intermedius while T. denticola, B. forsythus, P. nigrescens, E. corrodens, S. noxia and C. rectus were recovered from 11 patients. P. gingivalis was recovered from 9 patients and 18 sites while corresponding figures for A. actinomycetemcomitans were 8 and 19, respectively. A number of the investigated species (B. forsythus, T. denticola, P. intermedia, C rectus) reached high levels (> or =10(6) cells) in more than 1/2 of the patients. On the other hand, bacteria such as A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis were infrequently encountered at high levels in these subgingival samples. In conclusion, the analysis failed to demonstrate a PLS-specific profile of the subgingival infection, since the bacterial composition of the sampled sites closely resembled that characterising deep pockets in adult periodontitis patients.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of AM-1155 in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - AM-1155 is a new 8-methoxyquinolonecarboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. It inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Peptostreptococcus magnus, Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella bivia at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. The antibacterial activity of AM-1155 was almost equal to that of sparfloxacin. The in vivo efficacy of AM-1155 was evaluated using a polymicrobial pyometra (E. coli and B. fragilis) model of rats. The accumulation of neutrophils to the uterus in the AM-1155-treated group was less marked than that of the nontreated group, as well as the bacteriological response. These results suggest that the new antimicrobial agent AM-1155 might be useful for the treatment of polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
TI  - Semiquantitative bacteriology of closed odontogenic abscesses.
AB  - Pus samples from twenty-three dentoalveolar abscesses were collected by needle aspiration and examined by direct inoculation technique using 6 different aerobic and anaerobic agar plates. For aerobic culture, sheep blood agar and chocolate agar (Kyokuto Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan) were used. For anaerobic culture, four different media, 1) brucella HK agar with hemolyzed rabbit blood and defibrillated sheep blood, 2) paramomycin-vancomycin brucella HK agar with hemolyzed rabbit blood, 3) phenylethyl alcohol brucella HK agar with hemolyzed rabbit blood, 4) bacteroides bile esculin agar (Kyokuto Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan) were prepared in an anaerobic jar prior to inoculation. The aerobic agar plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees C, and the anaerobic plates at least 48 h at 37 degrees C in anaerobic jars. From 23 closed odontogenic abscess samples, a total of 112 bacterial strains were isolated; 81 strains (72.3%) were strict anaerobes, and 31 strains (27.7%) were aerobes. The mean number of bacterial strains per positive sample was 4.86. Oral Streptococci, Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus and Veillonella were common isolates. The combination of Oral Streptococci and Prevotella was found in 11 patients (47.8%), and that of Prevotella and Peptostreptococcus in 12 patients (52.2%). The present study demonstrated that closed odontogenic abscesses are polymicrobial infections by aerobes and anaerobes. Application of a direct inoculation technique for bacterial culture made it possible to isolate more anaerobes than our commonly used technique using transport medium and to delineate the semiquantitative bacteriology of closed odontogenic abscess.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of macrolides against clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of 6 macrolides was determined using a micro-broth dilution method, against 535 clinical isolates of 22 species, which were isolated in 1996 from 325 facilities in Japan. Results were as follows. 1. In general, antimicrobial activities of 14-membered macrolides were higher than those of 16-membered macrolides. The antimicrobial activities of 14-membered macrolides were in the order of clarithromycin (CAM), erythromycin (EM), roxithromycin (RXM). Among 16-membered macrolides, rokitamycin (RKM) was the most potent, josamycin (JM) was next potent followed by midecamycin (MDM). More numbers of highly-resistant strain of > 100 micrograms/ml were recognized in 14-membered macrolides than in 16-membered macrorides. 2. Most of S. pyogenes (group A) strains were distributed in the susceptible range and almost none was found in the resistant range. 3. S. pneumoniae strains were distributed widely from the susceptible range to the highly resistant range, and as high as 37.1% fell into the high resistance of > 100 micrograms/ml range. 4. Against Peptostreptococcus spp. and MRSA, 16-membered macrolides were more effective than 14-membered macrorlides, and their antibacterial activities were in the order of RKM, JM, MDM. Ratio of high-resistant strains of > 100 micrograms/ml against 14-membered macrolides was much higher than that against 16-membered macrolies. 5. Most of M. (B.) catarrhalis strains were distributed in the susceptible range of < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml, and most of H. influenzae strains were distributed within the moderately resistant and the resistant ranges. 6. In M. (B.) catarrhalis and H. influenzae, no correlation between macrolide resistance and beta-lactamase production was recognized. 7. Most of C. jejuni strains were susceptible to all macrolides used in this study.
TI  - Endodontic pathogens stimulate monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-8 in mononuclear cells.
AB  - Microbial infection of the dental pulp leads to the recruitment of leukocytes and the formation of lesions of endodontic origin. The chemokines interleukin-8 (IL-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) are relatively specific chemoattractants for neutrophils and monocytes, respectively. In the present studies, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated by Streptococcus mutants, Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, which are associated with lesions of endodontic origin. Each of these bacteria induced a dose-dependent increase in IL-8 and MCP-1, determined by ELISA. The levels induced are physiologically relevant. However, low doses of P. endodontalis were less effective in inducing IL-8 or MCP-1 expression, compared with S. mutants or P. anaerobius. Thus, these bacteria can induce significant levels of the chemokines IL-8 and MCP-1, which could contribute to the recruitment of neutrophils or monocytes in vivo. The expression of these mediators may contribute to the development of endodontic infections, particularly with regard to inflammatory leukocyte recruitment.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of retroperitoneal abscesses.
AB  - The aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of various types of retroperitoneal abscesses was studied by review of the clinical and laboratory data for 161 patients treated between 1974 and 1990 for such abscesses. These included 109 anterior, 8 posterior, 21 retrofascial, and 23 pelvic retroperitoneal abscesses. A total of 472 organisms (2.9 isolates/specimen)--204 aerobic and facultative (1.3/specimen), and 268 anaerobic (1.7/specimen)--were recovered. Aerobes only were recovered from 34 abscesses (21%), anaerobes only from 34 (21%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 93 (58%). Polymicrobial infection was present in 132 patients (82%). The predominant aerobic and facultative isolates were Escherichia coli (60 isolates), Klebsiella pneumoniae (20), Streptococcus group D (19), and Staphylococcus aureus (11). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus species (95 isolates), Bacteroides fragilis group (66), Prevotella species (22), and Clostridium species (22). The number of anaerobes per site always was greater than the number of aerobic or facultative organisms and was especially high in pelvic abscesses. The number of aerobic and facultative organisms was especially high in pancreatic abscesses. These data highlight the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic nature of retroperitoneal abscesses.
TI  - Bacterial interference in the nasopharynx following antimicrobial therapy of acute otitis media.
AB  - The effect on the nasopharyngeal bacterial flora of therapy for 10 days with co-amoxiclav or cefprozil was studied in 50 children with acute otitis media. Before therapy, potential pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis) were isolated in 14 (56%) of those treated with co-amoxiclav and 15 (60%) of those treated with cefprozil. Following therapy, the reduction in the number of these pathogens was the same in the two groups. However, differences between the groups were noted in the recovery of organisms with interfering capability, namely alpha-haemolytic streptococci, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Prevotella melaninogenica. Fifty interfering organisms were recovered from each group before therapy. After therapy with co-amoxiclav or cefprozil their number declined to 11 and 42, respectively (P< 0.001).
TI  - Subgingival microbiota of shallow periodontal pockets in individuals after head and neck irradiation.
AB  - This study aimed at investigating the subgingival plaque microorganisms of shallow pockets (< or = 5 mm) in subjects who previously received irradiation in the head and neck region for treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Direct microscopy and anaerobic culture were used. Subgingival paper point samples were taken from 6 tooth-sites (one/sextant) per subject for direct microscopy (n = 108). Another set of paper points was taken from the deepest of the previously selected sites (one per subject) with: group A) no bleeding on probing to the sulcus depth (n = 9) and group B) bleeding on probing to the sulcus depth (n = 6) for microscopic and anaerobic culture study. Under the microscope, the microflora was found to be a complex mixture comprising gram-positive and gram-negative cocci, rods and filaments, fusiforms, curved rods and spirochetes. Low level of fungi were observed and mycelia were occasionally detected. There was no significant variation in the plaque bacterial morphotypes observable according to sites of isolation and no significant difference between group A and group B in morphotypes of the different microflora. The predominant cultivable microflora comprised several species of facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria: Gemella, Peptostreptococcus, Staphylococcus, Stomatococcus, Streptococcus, Actinomyces, Eubacterium, Lactobacillus, Propionibacterium, Neisseria, Veillonella, Bacteroides, Campylobacter, Capnocytophaga, Fusobacterium, Kingella, Porphyromonas and Prevotella species. There was no difference between the two groups except the significantly higher proportion of Kingella dentrificans isolated from group B sites. However, colonization of the gingival sulcus in these individuals by microbes that are normal flora of: skin (Peptostreptococcus prevotii and Propionibacterium granulosum) and gut (Eubacterium aerofaciens, Fusobacterium mortiferum and Fusobacterium varium) was detected. These findings appear to suggest that the major components of the subgingival microflora of shallow sites in previously head- and neck-irradiated individuals are similar to that of gingivitis sites in the normal population although they may contain bacterial or fungal species uncommon in normal subjects.
TI  - Microbiology of necrotizing fasciitis associated with omphalitis in the newborn infant.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to report the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of periumbilical necrotizing fasciitis in newborn infants. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review was done of the author's 20-year experience. RESULTS: Specimens obtained from 11 newborn infants with periumbilical necrotizing fasciitis were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 38 bacterial isolates was recovered: 21 aerobic and facultative and 17 anaerobic. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 1 specimen (9%), anaerobes only in 2 (18%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora in 8 (73%). Multiple organisms were recovered from all instances and the number of isolates varied from two to six (average 3.5 isolates per specimen). The predominant isolates were Peptostreptococcus sp. (7 isolates); Bacteroides fragilis group (6); streptococcus group B (4); and Staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus group D, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis (3 each). All patients underwent extensive debridement and resection, and they received supportive and antimicrobial therapy. Six (55%) of the patients died. CONCLUSIONS: These findings illustrate the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora of periumbilical necrotizing fasciitis.
TI  - Microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  - It has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. The purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. The presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. Similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. Community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. One complex consisted of the tightly related group: Bacteroides forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola. The 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the Fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Peptostreptococcus micros. Species associated with this group included: Eubacterium nodatum, Campylobacter rectus, Campylobacter showae, Streptococcus constellatus and Campylobacter gracilis. The 3rd complex consisted of Streptococcus sanguis, S. oralis, S. mitis, S. gordonii and S. intermedius. The 4th complex was comprised of 3 Capnocytophaga species, Campylobacter concisus, Eikenella corrodens and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. The 5th complex consisted of Veillonella parvula and Actinomyces odontolyticus. A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, Selenomonas noxia and Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (A. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. The 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of a new carbapenem BO-2727 for use in obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of BO-2727 against 100 clinical isolates of Streptococcus agalactiae (20 strains), Escherichia coli (20 strains), Peptostreptococcus magnus (20 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (20 strains) and Prevotella bivia (20 strains) was compared with those of imipenem, panipenem, meropenem, biapenem and ceftazidime (CAZ). Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for 50% of tested strains (MIC50s) of BO-2727 against S. agalactiae, E. coli, P. magnus, B. fragilis and P. bivia were 0.05, 0.05, 0.1, 0.78 and 0.78 mg/l, respectively. MIC90s of BO-2727 against S. agalactiae, E. coli, P. magnus, B. fragilis and P. bivia were 0.05, 0.05, 0.1, 0.78 and 0.78 mg/l, respectively. The efficacy of BO-2727 was evaluated using a polymicrobial pyometra model (E. coli and B. fragilis) in rats. Both the inflammatory changes in the uterus, from the point of view of neutrophil accumulation, and the bacteriological response in the treated group were milder than those in either the nontreated group or the CAZ-treated group. These results indicate that BO-2727 may be useful for the treatment of polymicrobial infections in patients with pyometra.
TI  - [Meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  - Meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position C1 which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (DHP-1), thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. Its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in C2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. Meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the PBPs. It covers gram positive aerobes (Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, Enterococcus faecalis, Rhodococcus equi, Listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, Vibrio, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria, Moraxella) and anaerobes (Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, and Propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: P. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and H. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci, streptococci and staphylococci). Meropenem has no activity on Enterococcus faecium, S. aureus resistant to methycillin, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). Resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the OprD porin (OprD2 in enterobacteria and P. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the PBPs (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).
TI  - [Trend of bacterial meningitis in children over a 14 year period (1981 through 1994) in Japan--an analysis based on studies in 27 institutions].
AB  - We observed 266 children with purulent meningitis in 27 institutions in Japan during the 14 years from 1981 on dividing these years into 3 periods, 1981-1985, 1986-1990 and 1991-1994, and studied the trend of causative organisms identified in 254 among the 266 patients. Their ages were less than 3 months after birth in 50 children and 3 months or older in 216: there were 141 boys and 125 girls. The causative organisms were H. influenzae in 134 patients and S. pneumoniae in 50, most of them being aged 3 months or older. Next to the above bacteria ranked S. agalactiae in 29 and E. coli in 12, many of the patients were aged less than 3 months. Staphylococcus spp. was found in 7 patients and about 70% of them were aged 3 months or older. L. monocytogenes was found in 4 patients and N. meningitidis in 3 and they were aged 3 months or older in both patient groups. S. pyogenes, Enterococcus spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., P. Mirabilis and Enterobacter spp. were detected each in 1 patient. The causative organism was unknown in 21 patients and there was no double infection. H. influenzae were detected in 18 patients in 1981-1985 period (36.7%), in 56 in 1986-1990 (54.9%) and in 60 in 1991-1994 (63.8%) showing an increasing tendency, but S. pneumoniae exhibited neither an increasing nor decreasing tendency. There was a decreasing tendency with S. agalactiae and E. coli, but the details were not clear because there were few patients aged less than 3 months. Although the period of coexistence of 4 main bacterial species was not made clear in this study. Listeria is considered to develop mainly in the early childhood, and we believe that the conventional way of using a cephem preparation and ampicillin combined for patients under 6 years need not be altered. However, panipenem (phonetic) is likely to be effective for insensible S. pneumoniae for the time being.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of clarithromycin against recent obtained clinical isolates].
AB  - In order to evaluate antimicrobial activities of clarithromycin (CAM), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CAM and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates that were obtained from outpatients in 1994 and 1996. The results are summarized as follows; 1. It was not showed that CAM-resistant strains were increasing among Staphylococcus spp., beta-streptococci, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Bordetella pertussis, Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni, Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. It appeared that resistances to CAM and macrolides (MLs) were increasing among Streptococcus pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp. 2. The drug susceptibility patterns to MLs were similar and detection frequencies of induced resistant strains that were resistant to only 14-membered ring MLs including CAM and constitutive resistant strains that were resistant to 14 and 16-membered ring MLs were high among Streptococcus pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp. It appears that MLs-resistance systems are linked to each other, and that this was a cause of increasing MLs-resistance among these bacterial species. 3. Notwithstanding of antibiotic resistance problems, CAM is still useful since it maintains strong antimicrobial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, B. pertussis, C. jejuni subsp. jejuni, C. trachomatis and M. pneumoniae, and it controls arginate producing abilities of mucoide strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Prospective study of bacteremia rate after elastic band ligation and sclerotherapy of esophageal varices in patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Esophageal band ligation is considered to be as efficient as endoscopic sclerotherapy, with a lower complication rate, including bacteremia. There are few studies comparing the two methods. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of bacteremia after both treatments in patients with portal hypertension secondary to schistosomiasis. METHODS: Endoscopic sclerotherapy and band ligation were performed using standard techniques. Blood samples were obtained 5 and 30 minutes after endoscopic band ligation or sclerotherapy and cultured for aerobic and anaerobic organisms. RESULTS: In the sclerotherapy group 2 of 43 (4.6%) blood cultures were positive (Peptostreptococcus sp and Streptococcus mitis). A similar result was obtained in the band ligation group: 2 of 35 (5.7%) had positive cultures, both with Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSIONS: There is no difference in the frequency of bacteremia after treatment of esophageal varices with endoscopic sclerotherapy or endoscopic band ligation in patients with portal hypertension secondary to schistosomiasis.
TI  - The aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of perirectal abscesses.
AB  - The microbiology of perirectal abscesses in 144 patients was studied. Aerobic or  facultative bacteria only were isolated in 13 (9%) instances, anaerobic bacteria only were isolated in 27 (19%) instances, and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were isolated in 104 (72%) instances. A total of 325 anaerobic and 131 aerobic or facultative isolates were recovered (2.2 anaerobic isolates and 0.9 aerobic isolates per specimen). The predominant anaerobes were as follows: Bacteroides fragilis group (85 isolates), Peptostreptococcus spp. (72 isolates), Prevotella spp. (71 isolates), Fusobacterium spp. (21 isolates), Porphyromonas spp. (20 isolates), and Clostridium spp. (15 isolates). The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were as follows: Staphylococcus aureus (34 isolates), Streptococcus spp. (28 isolates), and Escherichia coli (19 isolates). These data illustrate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of perirectal abscesses.
TI  - Dental implant infections.
AB  - Dental implants provide a restorative tool to support crowns, bridge abutments, and removable dentures. Osseointegrated implants are titanium posts that are surgically implanted in alveolar bone. A tight immobile bond (osseointegration) forms between bone and titanium, and prosthetic and restorative fixtures are attached to the implants. Titanium implants differ from natural teeth, which may make them more susceptible to mechanical stress. A small proportion of implants are not successful and may fail due to infection. The microbiota of implants is similar to that of teeth in similar clinical states. Implants that fail because of mechanical stress are colonized by species associated with healthy teeth. Infected implants are colonized by subgingival species, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter gracilis, Streptococcus intermedius, and Peptostreptococcus micros. Different patients may be colonized by different microbial complexes, indicating that optimal treatment should be directed to the specific infection.
TI  - Increased susceptibility of RAG-2 SCID mice to dissemination of endodontic infections.
AB  - Specific immunity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of periapical lesions,  although the extent to which these mechanisms are actually involved in either protection or destruction of the pulp-periapex complex is yet to be established. To investigate this question we compared periapical-lesion pathogenesis in RAG-2 severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice with immunocompetent control mice following surgical pulp exposure. In order to equalize the bacterial challenge, an infection protocol using Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Streptococcus intermedius was devised. The results demonstrated that after infection, the proportion of the root canal flora represented by the four pathogens was almost identical in both groups (39.9 and 42.2% for RAG-2 and immunocompetent control mice, respectively). The effects of abrogation of T- and B-cell mechanisms on periapical pathogenesis were then assessed. Approximately one-third of the RAG-2 mice developed endodontic abscesses, while no immunocompetent controls had abscesses, results which indicated regional dissemination of the infection. A similar incidence of abscesses was found in two additional experiments. Abscessed RAG-2 teeth had significantly larger periapical lesions than did nonabscessed RAG-2 teeth (P < or = 0.05) and exposed immunocompetent controls (P < or = 0.01), whereas nonabscessed RAG-2 teeth were not significantly different from those of exposed immunocompetent controls in periapical-lesion size. We conclude that B- and T-cell-mediated immunity protects the host from the dissemination of endodontic infections and that RAG-2 mice are more susceptible to infection-induced pulp-periapex destruction.
TI  - Use of the isolator 1.5 microbial tube for culture of synovial fluid from patients with septic arthritis.
AB  - Synovial fluid specimens obtained from patients with arthritis were plated onto solid media (conventional cultures) or inoculated into an Isolator 1.5 microbial tube (Isolator cultures), and the yield and time to detection of organisms were compared. Overall, 144 specimens obtained from 137 patients were processed, and 31 (21.5%) cultures obtained from 29 patients were positive by at least one method. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 12 patients, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Kingella kingae were isolated from 4 patients each, group G streptococci were isolated from 3 patients, Staphylococcus epidermidis and members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were isolated from 2 patients each, and Streptococcus mitis and Peptostreptococcus prevotii were isolated from 1 patient each. Overall, the causative organism was detected in 31 of 31 (100.0%) Isolator cultures and 24 of 31 (77.4%) conventional cultures (P < 0.02). Twenty-nine of 31 (93.5%) positive Isolator cultures and 20 of 24 (83.3%) conventional cultures were positive by the second day of incubation. Among the 24 cultures positive by both methods, higher numbers of CFU per milliliter were detected with the Isolator system in 13 cultures and with conventional cultures in 2 cultures (P < 0.002). Inoculation of synovial fluid into an Isolator 1.5 microbial tube improves the recovery of organisms causing septic arthritis.
TI  - Ribotyping of bacteria from root canal and blood of patients receiving endodontic therapy.
AB  - DNA restriction patterns and corresponding ribotypes of 26 bacterial isolates (Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus intermedius, and Streptococcus sanguis) recovered from patients with infected root canals and their peripheral blood, collected during and after endodontic therapy, were examined. Eleven additional reference strains including type strains were also examined. Purified DNA was digested with BglI,EcoRI, and HindIII. Hybridization was carried out with a digoxigenin-labeled cDNA probe obtained by reverse transcription of Escherichia coli 16S + 23S rRNA. Ribotypes of the bacteria recovered from root canal and blood showed identical characteristics within the patients, and differed between the patients. The results were confirmed when the similarity coefficient (S(AB)) of the ribotypes from the isolates were assessed by the Dendron computer-assisted system. These results suggested that the bacteria isolated from the blood originated from the root canal.

TI  - Occurrence of invading bacteria in radicular dentin of periodontally diseased teeth: microbiological findings.
AB  - Bacterial invasion in roots of periodontally diseased teeth, which has been recently documented using cultural and microscopic techniques, may be important in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the occurrence and the species of invading bacteria in radicular dentin of periodontally diseased teeth. Samples were taken from the middle layer of radicular dentin of 26 periodontally diseased teeth. 14 healthy teeth were used as controls. Dentin samples were cultured anaerobically. The chosen methodology allowed the determination of the numbers of bacteria present in both deeper and outer part of dentinal tubules, and the bacterial concentration in dentin samples, expressed as colony forming units per mg of tissue (CFU/mg). Invading bacteria was detected in 14 (53.8%) samples from periodontally diseased teeth. The bacterial concentration ranged from 831.84 to 11971.3 CFU/mg (mean+/-standard deviation: 3043.15+/-2763.13). Micro-organisms identified included putative periodontal pathogens such as Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides forsythus, Peptostreptococcus micros and Streptococcus intermedius. These findings suggest that radicular dentin could act as bacterial reservoir from which periodontal pathogens can recolonize treated periodontal pockets, contributing to the failure of therapy and recurrence of disease.
TI  - A microbiological study of pre- and postoperative apicoectomy sites.
AB  - There is little information on the microbiology of periapical lesions, and no data on the residual microbial flora in the periapex, if any, after apicoectomy procedures. Hence, 64 patients treated by apicoectomy procedures were prospectively studied to assess the bacterial flora in the periapex and to evaluate the residual bacteria in postoperative apicoectomy sites. Of the 64 lesions studied, 14 (22%) were sterile and 50 (78%) yielded bacteria preoperatively. Bacteria could be recovered from 28 (56%) of the latter lesions after apicoectomy and curettage. A total of 105 bacterial strains was isolated from 50 lesions, yielding a range of 1-4 (mean 2.1) species per sample. The isolates comprised 84 (80%) facultative anaerobes and 21 (20%) strict anaerobes. A polymicrobial growth was obtained from 39 lesions whilst 11 lesions yielded pure cultures. On detailed microbiological analyses of 29 lesions, 40% of the isolates were identified as alpha-haemolytic streptococci, half of which were Streptococcus sanguis; anaerobic streptococci were the predominant anaerobes. None of the organisms or group(s) of organisms emerged as recalcitrant colonisers which were difficult to dislodge after surgical debridement. These data indicate that the majority of periapical lesions harbour a variety of flora which cannot be eradicated despite thorough apicoectomy procedures.
TI  - Gram-positive resistance: challenge for the development of new antibiotics.
AB  - The incidence of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive organisms is increasing despite advances in antibacterial therapy over the last 20 years. As the pathogens causing these infections are frequently resistant to most currently available antibacterials, they are extremely difficult to treat. Problematic pathogens include strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to beta-lactams and macrolides, viridans group streptococci resistant to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides, enterococci resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin and highly resistant to penicillins and aminoglycosides, and Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, other beta-lactams, macrolides, lincosamides and aminoglycosides. Other important pathogens include Streptococcus pyogenes resistant to macrolides (and suspected to be resistant to penicillin), macrolide-resistant streptococci of groups B, C, and G, coagulase-negative staphylococci resistant to beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, macrolides, lincosamides and glycopeptides, multiresistant strains of Listeria and Corynebacterium and Gram-positive anaerobes, such as Peptostreptococcus and Clostridium, resistant to penicillins and macrolides. Thus, there is an urgent need for new antibacterial agents that are able to overcome multidrug-resistant mechanisms. The novel semisynthetic injectable streptogramin quinupristin/dalfopristin offers the prospect of effective treatment against many of the above pathogens.
TI  - Microbiology of nonbullous impetigo.
AB  - Our objective was to establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of nonbullous impetigo (NI) in children. We used a retrospective review of clinical microbiology laboratory and patients' records. Specimens were obtained from 40 patients with NI lesions and showed bacterial growth. Aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria only were present in 24 patients (60%), strict anaerobic bacteria only in 5 patients (12.5%), and mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in 11 patients (27.5%). Sixty-four isolates were recovered (1.6 per specimen): 43 aerobic or facultative, and 21 anaerobic. The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (29 isolates), Group A beta hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) (13 isolates), and Escherichia coli (1 isolate). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (12), pigmented Prevotella spp. (5), Fusobacterium spp. (2), and Bacteroides fragilis (1). Single bacterial isolates were recovered in 17 patients (42.5%), 13 of which were S. aureus. S. aureus alone or mixed with GABHS or Peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from all body sites. Mixed flora of Peptostreptococcus spp. with Prevotella spp. or Fusobacterium spp. was mostly found in infections of the head and neck, while E. coli mixed with B. fragilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from one infection of the buttocks area. Thirty-three organisms isolated from 32 patients (80%) produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. This study demonstrates the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic microbiology of NI lesions.
TI  - Protein degradation by Prevotella intermedia and Actinomyces meyeri supports the  growth of non-protein-cleaving oral bacteria in serum.
AB  - The proteolytic activities of oral bacteria are thought to play an important role in the aetiology of dental abscesses. Bacteria-derived proteases may contribute to tissue destruction, and are likely to impair host defence by degrading immunoglobulins and complement. Degraded periodontal tissue and tissue fluid are likely to constitute essential sources of nutrients in the abscess. Tissue fluid, which is derived from serum, is rich in protein and poor in carbohydrate, suggesting that breakdown of protein and fermentation of amino acids is a crucial step to generate energy for growth of the microflora. The number of oral bacterial species that perform hydrolytic cleavage of protein into polypeptides, the first step in protein degradation, is relatively small compared to the large majority of peptidase-producing species. In this study, we therefore investigated the growth-promoting effect of proteinase-producing species like Prevotella intermedia and Actinomyces meyeri on the growth of some non-proteinase producing bacteria in mixed cultures. We used serum as a substitute for the supposed natural substrate of the abscess microflora. The breakdown of serum proteins was investigated using capillary electrophoresis. Poor growth was found in mono- and mixed cultures of non-proteinase producing species Eubacterium lentum, Fusobacterium nucleatum. Peptostreptococcus micros, and Streptococcus intermedius. The presence of P. intermedia in mixed cultures strongly enhanced growth of these 4 species, according to the hypothesis that the growth of the mixed cultures was peptide-limited. The enhanced growth of P. intermedia in pronase-digested serum indicated peptide-limited growth of this organism in serum, despite its production of proteinase. We found that growth of monocultures of Actinomyces meyeri was poor. In contrast, A. meyeri grew well in mixed cultures and its presence stimulated growth of F. nucleatum and P. micros, suggesting a synergistic relationship. The growth of mono- and mixed cultures was investigated using one representative strain of each species. Thus, there is a small risk of having selected unique strains. Proteinase inhibitors reduced the growth of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella nigrescens, and P. intermedia in trypticase peptone-yeast extract medium with, and without, IgG. Our study indicated that proteinase-producing organisms play a key role in mixed cultures of oral bacteria in human serum by providing polypeptides for growth. This may explain their association with dental abscesses.
TI  - Synthesis by an alpha-glucosidase of glycosyl-trehaloses with an isomaltosyl residue.
AB  - Glycosyl-trehaloses with an isomaltosyl residue were synthesized by alpha-glucosidase from Aspergillus niger by using maltotetraose as a glucosyl donor and trehalose as the acceptor. The one trisaccharide and two tetrasaccharides formed were isolated by successive column chromatography. The results of an enzymatic digestion, methylation analysis, and 13C-NMR studies indicated that these oligosaccharides were alpha-isomaltosyl alpha-glucoside, alpha-isomaltotriosyl alpha-glucoside and alpha-isomaltoside. These oligosaccharides were not fermented to an acid by Streptococcus mutans, and they effectively inhibited water-insoluble glucan synthesis from sucrose by glucosyltransferase. In an in vitro utilization test with human intestinal bacteria, these oligosaccharides were predominantly utilized by Bifidobacteria.
TI  - Fungi in therapy-resistant apical periodontitis.
AB  - The occurrence of yeasts in 967 microbiological endodontic samples taken from root canals in persistent endodontic infections was studied. The sampling was done by general practitioners in various parts of Finland from root canal infections which did not respond favourably to standard conservative therapy. The samples were cultivated aerobically on a non-selective enriched horse blood agar medium, on TSBV agar medium in 5% CO2 and anaerobically on horse blood agar medium. Micro-organisms were found in 692 of the samples while 275 showed no growth. Forty-eight fungi were isolated from 47 samples which is 7% of the culture-positive samples. Twenty yeast strains were identified further by their colony morphology, growth and cellular characteristics and patterns of carbohydrate assimilation. All isolates except one belonged to the genus Candida. Candida albicans was the most common species. C. glabrata was found together with C. albicans in one sample. C. guilliermondii, C. inconspicua and Geotrichum candidum were each isolated once. Yeasts were found in pure culture in six samples and together with bacteria in 41 samples. In all the samples except two, the accompanying facultative bacteria were Gram positive. The most frequent of them were alpha- and non-haemolytic Streptococcus species which were found in 31 samples. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated together with yeasts from 12 root canals. They included both Gram positive species such as Peptostreptococcus micros and Gram negative species such as Fusobacterium nucleatum. The regular isolation of yeasts, also in pure culture, indicates that yeasts may have an important role in cases of apical periodontitis persisting after conventional treatment.
TI  - Polymicrobial brain abscess in a patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus.
AB  - Although intracranial mass lesions that occur as a result of infection have commonly been reported in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus, polymicrobial pyogenic brain abscess has not been described in this setting. We report the first case of a patient with a polymicrobial brain abscess involving Streptococcus bovis, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Peptostreptococcus, and group G Streptococcus, and we review the relevant world literature.
TI  - Tissue penetration of Meropenem in patients undergoing gynecologic surgery.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the tissue-penetrating ability of a new beta-lactam antibiotic, meropenem, in 64 patients undergoing elective gynecologic surgery. Patients received a single 500-mg dose intravenously before surgery. Plasma and tissue concentrations of meropenem were highest at approximately 1 hour, and good tissue penetration was seen in the variety of specimens evaluated. The median plasma concentration at approximately 1 hour was 13.3 micrograms/mL. The median fluid and tissue concentrations at approximately 1 hour were as follows: cervix, 8.5 micrograms/g; endometrium, 2.3 micrograms/g; fallopian tube, 1.9 micrograms/g; myometrium, 3.6 micrograms/g; ovary, 2.3 micrograms/g; and uterus, 2.3 micrograms/g. These tissue concentrations exceed the MICs of meropenem for 90% of typical pathogens associated with gynecologic infections. Meropenem readily penetrates gynecologic tissue. A single 500-mg dose provides adequate tissue concentrations for treatment of gynecologic infections caused by susceptible pathogens.
TI  - Chronic sinusitis in children.
AB  - In children, sinusitis is a common, generally uncomplicated, and self limiting disease which drops with age. The diagnosis is difficult because of relatively non specific signs and symptoms that overlap with viral upper respiratory infection and allergy. Plain paranasal sinus radiographs are not adequate, in determining the extent of involvement in recurrent or chronic sinusitis and so CT scan has become the standard. Viral illness appears to be the most common predisposing factor. Immune defects (mainly IG2 and IGA) may exist in a significant percentage of children. The role of allergy seems less important. With advances in the genetic field of cystic fibrosis, genetic factors are advocated in chronic or recurrent sinusitis. The most common bacterial pathogens in pediatric sinusitis patients are SP (Streptococcus Pneumoniae), HI (Hemophilus Influenza) and MC (Moraxella Catarrhalis). Other less frequent bacterial species include group A streptococcus, group C streptococcus, streptococcus viridans, peptostreptococcus, moraxella species and Eikenella corrodens. Respiratory anaerobes are not common. Antibiotics resistant to the action of the beta-lactamase are the cornerstone in medical treatment. In recurrent acute sinusitis prophylactic antimicrobials may be helpful. The indication for surgery remains controversial. To date, we have no prospective studies comparing surgical to medical therapy in order to guide us in deciding surgical indication. It is therefore recommended to follow a conservative track and to limit surgical procedures in children with suppurative complications, nasal obstruction from polyposis or refractory sinusitis aggravating chronic pulmonary disease such as asthma.
TI  - [Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in chronic sinusitis in adults].
AB  - The aim of the study was to analyse microbiologically samples obtained from 30 patients aged from 21 to 73 years treated for chronic sinusitis. Aerobic bacteria only were isolated in 16 patients (53%), and anaerobic organisms only in 5 patients (17%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates were recovered from 9 patients (30%). The isolated aerobic bacteria were as follows: streptococci from the species Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus group C, Streptococcus sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative rods from the genus Haemophilus and rods from the Enterobacteriaceae family, and strains of Moraxella catarrhalis. The isolated anaerobic microorganisms Gram-negative rods from the genus Prevotella, Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Gram-positive cocci from the genus Peptostreptococcus. Other organisms from the genus Vailonella, Eubacterium and Actinomyces were isolated less frequently. In 15 patients only one isolate was recovered, in 15 patients isolated bacteria were mixed with other microorganisms.
TI  - Contemporary management of deep neck space infections.
AB  - Deep neck infections continue to be seen despite the wide use of antibiotics. These infections follow along fascial planes to create deep neck space abscesses. The clinical presentation often points to the space involved. Understanding the regional anatomy gives the surgeon the ability to treat these grave infections. The records of 24 patients with a diagnosis of deep neck space abscess admitted to Hermann Hospital between 1988 and 1993 were reviewed. Fifty percent of the patients had received antibiotics for an infection of the ear, nose, or throat before the development of a neck space abscess. Ten patients had parapharyngeal abscesses, seven had retropharyngeal abscesses, six had submandibular space abscesses, and one had parotid space abscess. Thirty-five organisms were isolated in 18 cases (1.9 isolates per patient). The most common organism cultured was Streptococcus (13 of 18), followed by Staphylococcus (6 of 18), Bacteroides (5 of 18), Micrococcus (2 of 18), and Neisseria (2 of 18). One case each of Candida, Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Proteus, Proprionobacter, and Pseudomonas was cultured. Six patients had no growth on culture but did have organisms found on Gram's stain. The operative techniques and antibiotics used are discussed. The main complications of jugular vein thrombosis, carotid artery rupture, and mediastinitis are described, as well as an unusual case of meningitis from a large retropharyngeal-parapharyngeal abscess.
TI  - Bacteriology of dentoalveolar abscesses in patients who have received empirical antibiotic therapy.
AB  - We investigated aspirates of pus from dentoalveolar abscesses in 13 patients who  had received empirical antibiotic therapy within 1 month before presentation at our facility. The antibiotics administered were lincomycin, amoxicillin, ampicillin, or a cephalosporin. Information on antibiotic therapy was obtained from the patients' medical histories. Cultures of all dentoalveolar abscesses yielded organisms. A total of 70 isolates (42 anaerobes and 28 facultative organisms) were recovered, representing 5.3 isolates (3.2 anaerobes and 2.1 facultative organisms) per specimen. The counts of bacteria ranged from 5 X 10(7) cfu/mL to 8 X 10(11) cfu/mL (mean count, 1.4 X 10(11) cfu/mL; median count, 2.3 X 10(10) cfu/mL). The predominant isolates were Prevotella species (25.7% of isolates), Peptostreptococcus species (17.1%), and Streptococcus species (14.2%). This study illustrates the polymicrobial nature of dentoalveolar abscesses as well as the predominant role played by anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Microbiology of the transition from acute to chronic maxillary sinusitis.
AB  - Repeated aspirations of sinus secretions by endoscopy was performed in five patients over a period of 34-50 days and, ultimately, surgical drainage was done in three who presented with acute maxillary sinusitis that did not respond to antimicrobial therapy and became chronic. The aspirates were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Most of the bacteria isolated from the first culture were aerobic or facultative bacteria: Streptococcus pneumoniae (three isolates), Haemophilus influenzae non-type-b (two) and Moraxella catarrhalis (one). Three of these cultures yielded bacteria that were resistant to the antimicrobial agents prescribed for treatment. Failure to respond to therapy was associated with the emergence of resistant aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in subsequent aspirates. These organisms included Fusobacterium nucleatum, pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. Eradication of the infection was achieved in all instances following the administration of antimicrobial agents effective against these bacteria, and in three instances by surgical drainage. This study illustrates the microbial dynamics of maxillary sinusitis that did not respond to antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Microbiology of infected atopic dermatitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial infections occur frequently in lesions of atopic dermatitis (AD). The objectives of the study were to establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of secondarily infected AD. METHODS: A retrospective review was carried out of clinical and microbiology laboratory records and of data obtained from patients with secondarily infected AD lesions, whose specimens of infected sites were processed for the presence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: Bacterial growth was noted in 41 specimens. Aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria only were present in 15 patients (36%), anaerobic bacteria only in eight (20%), and mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in 18 (44%). Seventy-two isolates were recovered (1.8 per specimen), 34 aerobic or facultative bacteria, 35 strict anaerobes, and three Candida sp. The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (12 isolates), Group A beta hemolytic streptococcus in five isolates, and Escherichia coli in four. The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (13 isolates), pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. in eight, and Fusobacterium spp. in four isolates. Single bacterial isolates were recovered in 14 patients (34%), seven of which were S. aureus. Twenty-one of the organisms isolated from 16 patients (39%) produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. Organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to the lesions predominated in these infections. Enteric gram-negative rods and Bacteroides fragilis group predominated in lesions on legs and buttocks. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, pigmented Prevotella, and Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium spp. were most frequently recovered in lesions of the finger, scalp, face, and neck. CONCLUSIONS: The polymicrobial etiology of secondarily infected AD lesions and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomic site of the lesions are demonstrated.
TI  - Development and evaluation of a selective and differential medium for the primary isolation of Peptostreptococcus micros.
AB  - Peptostreptococcus micros, an anaerobic gram-positive coccus, has been associated with periodontal and endodontic lesions, including those refractory to treatment, as well as many human polymicrobial infections in other body locations. A selective and differential medium for the primary isolation of P. micros was developed and evaluated. Columbia CNA agar, a selective medium for gram-positive cocci, was supplemented with glutathione and lead acetate (P. micros medium: PMM). P. micros has a characteristic of rapidly utilizing the reduced form of glutathione to form hydrogen sulfide, which reacts with lead acetate producing a black precipitate in the medium. When grown on PMM, P. micros can be easily identified by its typical colonial morphology and the presence of a black precipitate directly under the colony. PMM was compared for the growth of P. micros with phenylethyl alcohol agar (PEA) and Columbia base medium (CBM) with 80 strains of P. micros and 30 strains of other gram-positive cocci. All P. micros isolates tested grew and showed the typical morphology of P. micros on PMM. Using colony counts on CBM as controls, there was an average 81.8% recovery in the number of P. micros colonies on PMM, in contrast to an average 6.1% recovery on PEA. Subgingival plaque and tongue samples from 12 adult periodontitis and 6 early-onset periodontitis patients were cultured onto PMM for the isolation of P. micros. P. micros was isolated on PMM and identified biochemically and enzymatically from both adult periodontitis and early-onset periodontitis patients with higher percentages isolated from the diseased periodontal pockets of adult periodontitis patients; furthermore, this is the first isolation of P. micros from tongue samples taken from periodontally diseased patients. This medium in cultural studies will further our understanding and assist future investigations of P. micros involved in disease processes.
TI  - Electrophoresis of whole-cell soluble proteins of microorganisms isolated from bacteremias in endodontic therapy.
AB  - We have previously demonstrated that anaerobic bacteria are the microorganisms most frequently isolated from blood following endodontic therapy of teeth with apical periodontitis. Phenotypic characterisation of the isolates suggested that the bacteria in the blood originated from the root canal. The present experiment using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was carried out in an effort to verify these findings, and to further study the microorganisms involved in endodontic bacteremias. Soluble cellular proteins were extracted from 11 reference strains and 26 bacterial isolates recovered from the root canal and blood. These included Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia. Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus sanguis. The electrophoretic patterns mostly confirmed the identity of the isolates as determined by the biochemical and antimicrobial resistance tests. Furthermore, with this typing method the species Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens could be differentiated. These species had been recovered from both root canal and blood. Also, differences between subspecies of Fusobacterium nucleatum became evident with SDS-PAGE, and the results indicated that the organism recovered from the root canal and blood was Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincentii. The electrophoretic patterns of the different organisms isolated from the root canal and the blood were similar, providing further evidence that the bacteria found in the blood originated from the root canal.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against clinical isolates].
AB  - In order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefodizime (CDZM), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CDZM and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates collected from nation-wide medical institutions and in our laboratory from September to December of 1992 and from September to December of 1995. The results are summarized as follows: 1. Bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to CDZM included Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter koseri, Proteus mirabilis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The range of MIC values of CDZM against Klebsiella pneumoniae was spread. Other strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., Peptostreptococcus spp. and Bacteroides fragilis group were resistant to cephems including CDZM. 2. The MIC90's of CDZM were 0.05 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml against Streptococcus spp., H. influenzae, M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, Klebsiella spp., P. mirabilis, N. gonorrhoeae and Peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently found in daily treatment of infections. It appears that the effectiveness of CDZM was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. Among H. influenzae isolates included imipenem (IPM)-resistant and norfloxacin (NFLX)-resistant strains. The MIC-range of CDZM against strains collected in 1995 including IPM-resistant and NFLX-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and MIC90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. CDZM showed strong antimicrobial activities against H. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.
TI  - Characterization of the binding properties of protein LG, an immunoglobulin-binding hybrid protein.
AB  - Protein LG is a 50-kDa hybrid molecule containing four Ig-light-chain-binding domains from protein L of Peptostreptococcus magnus and two IgG-Fe-binding repeats from streptococcal protein G. Here we analyse the binding of protein LG to Ig from several mammalian species. Protein LG was shown to bind human IgG of all subclasses and other Ig classes that carry kappa chains. The binding to human IgG was only marginally influenced by changes in temperature (4-37 degrees C) or salt concentration (0-1.6 M), and was stable over a wide pH range (pH 4-10). Protein LG bound to Ig from 11 of 12 mammalian species, including those of rabbit, mouse and rat. The affinity constants obtained for the interactions between protein LG and polyclonal IgG from rabbit (4.0 x 10(9) M-1), mouse (1.7 x 10(9) M-1) and rat (1.3 x 10(9) M-1) were similar to the value previously reported for the interaction between the hybrid protein and human polyclonal IgG (5.9 x 10(9) M-1). The interaction between protein LG and a mouse IgG mAb was not influenced by the presence of the specific protein antigen, nor was the binding of this antibody to its ligand affected by protein LG. Inhibition experiments demonstrated that the Ig-binding site of one of the fusion partners retained its ligand-binding capacity when the other component was occupied. Protein LG selectively absorbed 85-90% of the total Ig present in human and rabbit sera and 75-80% of the Ig in sera from mouse and rat. Human serum depleted of C1q, factor D and properdin and preabsorbed by protein LG could be used as a source for other complement factors. These data demonstrate that protein LG is a very versatile Ig-binding protein.

TI  - In vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500) against a large collection of infrequently isolated or tested species.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500, Synercid) is a parenteral streptogramin combination antimicrobial that possesses a synergistic and often bactericidal action against many Grampositive species. In this study, a collection of 1270 uncommonly isolated or tested strains were evaluated for susceptibility to quinupristin/dalfopristin using agar dilution minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods described in the National Committe for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The greatest antimicrobial activity observed for quinupristin/dalfopristin was against staphylococci, streptococci, the pathogenic neisseria, Legionella spp., Lactobacillus spp., and Peptostreptococcus spp. (MIC90 range, 0.5-2 micrograms/ml). Marginal activity (MIC90s, 4 to 8 micrograms/ml) was identified for the rarer enterococci, Leuconostoc spp., Pediococcus spp., and Streptococcus bovis. Against Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Fusobacterium spp., and Prevotella spp., the streptogramin was inactive. Although no susceptible breakpoint has been approved for quinupristin/dalfopristin, three possible breakpoints (< or = 1, < or = 2, or < or = 4 micrograms/mL) were evaluated. Acceptance of the lower breakpoints (< or = 1 or < or = 2 micrograms/mL) would limit quinupristin/dalfopristin use to staphylococci, streptococci, gonococci, meningococci, and Legionella spp. These results markedly expand the understanding of the usable spectrum of quinupristin/dalfopristin.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of necrotizing fasciitis in children.
AB  - Specimens obtained from eight children with necrotizing fasciitis (NF) were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 21 isolates were recovered, 13 anaerobic and 8 aerobic or facultatives. The facultative organism Streptococcus pyogenes was present alone in two (25%) instances, and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated in six (75%). The predominant isolates were Peptostreptococcus spp. (6 isolates, including 3 Peptostreptococcus magnus). S. pyogenes (4), Bacteroides fragilis group (3), Clostridium perfringens (2), Escherichia coli (2), and Prevotella spp. (2). Organisms similar to the ones isolated from the NF aspirates were recovered in the blood of all patients except one. These included S. pyogenes (3 isolates). B. fragilis group (2), E. coli (1), and P. magnus (1) and Clostridium perfringens (1). All patients underwent surgical fasciotomy, and four required skin grafting. Antimicrobials were administered to all children. Despite extensive resection and intense supportive therapy, three patients died from sepsis accompanied by shock acidosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. These findings illustrate the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora of NF in children.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of tosufloxacin against recently obtained clinical isolates].
AB  - To evaluate antimicrobial activities of tosufloxacin (TFLX), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of TFLX and other drugs were determined against clinical isolates that were obtained in our laboratory from February of 1993 to January of 1994 (Period I), and from February of 1995 to January of 1996 (Period II). The results are summarized as follows: 1. Compared to MIC90's reported by others for TFLX in the 1980's, those obtained by us against beta-streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Peptostreptococcus spp., Haemophilus influenzae and Salmonella spp. were similar to, but those obtained against other bacteria were higher than those reported values. 2. Detection frequencies of resistant strains to TFLX were compared between Period I and Period II. MIC90's of TFLX against Staphylococcus spp., Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, beta-streptococci, S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp. were lower in Period II than in Period I. TFLX-insensitive or -resistant H. influenzae were found among strains isolated in either of the Periods. 3. Most of the TFLX-resistant Gram-negative organisms tested were also resistant to other NQ's. 4. TFLX showed strong antimicrobial activities against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Bacteriologic findings in tonsillitis and pericoronitis.
AB  - Bacteriologic samples from 31 young men were cultured quantitatively for aerobes  and anaerobes; these samples included 31 specimens of tonsils (16 infected and 15 healthy), 16 specimens from pericoronal pockets of lower third molars (11 infected and 5 symptom-free), and 6 postoperative specimens from lower-third-molar extraction sockets. Anaerobes were isolated more often from infected third molars than from infected tonsils (14.5 isolates vs. 8.4 isolates, respectively; P < .001). Infected tonsil samples contained significantly more anaerobic species if an adjacent partly erupted lower third molar was present rather than absent (10.3 isolates vs. 6.9 isolates, respectively; P < .05). Eubacterium aerofaciens, Clostridium species, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Prevotella oris were frequently isolated. Streptococcus salivarius was found more frequently in tonsillar specimens, whereas Corynebacterium species, Prevotella denticola, Capnocytophaga species, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Lactobacillus species were more common in pericoronal pocket samples. Thus, partial eruption of lower third molars increases the number of anaerobic bacterial species on tonsils and many species can be isolated simultaneously from both tonsils and lower third molars.
TI  - [Orbit complication of sinusitis. A report of 7 cases].
AB  - Orbital complications of sinusitis were reviewed. Seven cases seen in a 6-year period from 1989 to 1994 were classified following Chandler. The pathogenesis, classification, diagnosis, and treatment of orbital complications, which are rare and steadily decreasing in frequency, are discussed. Because of its possible consequences, this complication should not be overlooked.
TI  - In vitro activity of the tricyclic beta-lactam GV104326.
AB  - GV104326 is a novel tricyclic beta-lactam (a trinem or, formerly, tribactam). The in vitro activity of GV104326 was compared with those of cefuroxime, cefixime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefpirome, and ciprofloxacin. GV104326 had in vitro activity generally similar to that of cefixime against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (MIC at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [MIC90], < or = 2 micrograms/ml), with cefuroxime and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid being 8- to 32-fold less active and with cefpirome being 4- to 8-fold more active against members of this family. The trinem had no activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC90, > 128 micrograms/ml) but was the most active agent against Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. GV104326 was particularly active against gram-positive cocci. Ninety percent of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains were susceptible to 0.03 microgram of GV104326 per ml, making it the most active agent studied. Enterococci and Lancefield group A and B streptococci were generally equally or somewhat more susceptible to GV104326 than they were to amoxicillin. Streptococcus pneumoniae strains were highly susceptible to GV104326, and those strains which showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin were generally twofold more susceptible to the trinem than to amoxicillin. Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were highly susceptible to GV104326 (MIC90s, 0.12 and 0.03 microgram/ml, respectively). The anaerobes Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus spp. were more susceptible to the trinems (formerly tribactams) than to the other agents studied.
TI  - Bacteremia shortly after placental separation during cesarean delivery.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess frequency, risk factors, and microbiology of bacteremia within 15 minutes of placental separation during cesarean delivery. METHODS: Ninety-three women undergoing cesarean delivery after a minimum of 4 hours of labor or ruptured membranes were compared with 26 women not in labor undergoing cesarean. Blood cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were obtained within 15 minutes of delivery of the placenta and before prophylactic antibiotic administration. Chorioamnionic membranes were also cultured. Demographic, labor, delivery, and postpartum characteristics were abstracted from the medical record. RESULTS: Bacteremia was detected in 13 (11%) of 119 women. Bacteremia occurred in 13 (14%) of 93 women after labor or rupture of membranes compared with zero of 26 women not in labor (P = .02). Isolates included group B streptococcus (n = 5), Gardnerella vaginalis (n = 5), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1), Peptostreptococcus sp (n = 1), and mixed flora of Prevotella bivia, G vaginalis, and viridans streptococci (n = 1). Bacteremia was associated with earlier median gestational age, lower median birth weight, and a positive chorioamnionic membrane culture. After adjustment for gestational age, intrauterine monitoring was also significantly associated with bacteremia. CONCLUSION: Bacteremia was common after labor in this population, especially in preterm deliveries and those with positive chorioamnionic-placental culture. Many of the isolates are capable of causing endocarditis. Appraisal of the risk of bacteremia and the risk of bacterial endocarditis should be made in individual patients to assess the need for antibiotic prophylaxis.
TI  - Clinical, microbiological and immunological profile of healthy, gingivitis and putative active periodontal subjects.
AB  - Thirteen periodontally healthy subjects were monitored clinically for 6-12 months. Clinical measurements at 6-weekly intervals included duplicate PD measurements, presence of plaque, redness, and bleeding on probing. Baseline measurements consisted of 2 visits 1 wk apart. Microbial samples were taken from 11 of the subjects who had completed at least 8 months of monitoring. Levels of serum antibodies to 12 periodontal species were determined from 10 subjects. Standard deviations of replicate PD measurements, computed for each subject, ranged from 0.2-0.3 mm over the monitoring period. Plaque and redness increased during monitoring, and showed a weak association with PD change. Baseline and follow-up distributions of PD changes indicated that changes of > 1.5 mm could reasonably be considered to represent active sites. Five subjects demonstrated at least 1 site deepening by 1.5 mm over the period monitored, and these were considered putative active subjects. Sites from 2 subjects showed PD increases in the 6 wk just before sampling, and these were considered to represent active sites. Species associated with putative active subjects included Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonella parvula, Selenomonas noxia and Prevotella nigrescens. Streptococcus sanguis, S. gordonii and Peptostreptococcus micros were associated with inactive subjects. S. gordonii and S. oralis were associated with health, whereas P. nigrescens was associated with gingivitis. Elevated serum antibodies were detected to A. actinomycetemcomitans in 4 subjects. The predominant microbiota of putative active subjects included some species previously associated with gingivitis, and some species previously associated with progressing periodontitis.
TI  - Response to periodontal therapy in patients with high or low levels of P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens and B. forsythus.
AB  - In a previous study, subjects receiving either adjunctive tetracycline or Augmentin showed, on average, more attachment level gain 10 months post-therapy than subjects receiving either Ibuprofen or a placebo, although some subjects in each treatment group showed loss of attachment post-therapy. Since differences in treatment response might have been due to differences in the subgingival microbiota, the response to different therapies in subjects with different pre-therapy subgingival microbiotas was evaluated. 29 subjects exhibiting loss of attachment > 2.5 mm at 1 or more sites during longitudinal monitoring were treated by modified Widman flap surgery at deep sites, subgingival scaling at all other sites and were randomly assigned one of the following agents: Augmentin, tetracycline, ibuprofen or a placebo. Treatment was completed within 30 days, during which time the subject took the assigned agent. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of each tooth at each visit and evaluated for their content of 14 subgingival species including P. gingivalis, P. nigrescens, P. intermedia and B. forsythus using DNA probes. 18 subjects with mean counts > 10(5) of 2 or more of these 4 species comprised the high test species group; 11 subjects with mean counts > 10(5) of 0 or 1 of the species, the low test species group. Because this was a post-hoc analysis, the number of subjects in some of the treatment/test species groups was small. However, the 8 high test species subjects who received tetracycline showed the most attachment level gain (0.83 +/- 0.20 mm), while the 3 tetracycline-treated, low test species subjects showed minimal gain (0.05 +/- 0.28 mm) 10 months post-therapy. Low test species subjects receiving Augmentin (n = 2) showed a mean gain in attachment of 0.67 (+/- 0.59) mm. The mean % of sites showing either attachment gain or loss > or = 2 mm was computed for each treatment/test species group. High test species subjects receiving tetracycline exhibited the best ratio of gaining to losing sites (16.2), followed by low test species subjects receiving Augmentin (14.1). Periodontal pockets < 7 mm pre-therapy in low test species subjects treated with Augmentin and high test species subjects treated with tetracycline showed attachment gain more frequently than attachment loss. The greatest proportion of gaining sites was seen at pockets > 6 mm, particularly in subjects receiving adjunctive tetracycline. Overall, the data indicated that a gain in mean attachment level post-therapy was significantly associated (p < 0.001) with an increase in C. ochracea accompanied by a decrease in B. forsythus, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia and P. nigrescens. The 4 test species were decreased more in subjects receiving tetracycline. In contrast, Augmentin appeared to be effective in decreasing the % sites colonized by A. actinomycetemcomitans and in increasing the proportion of sites colonized by C. ochracea. Knowledge of the baseline microbiota should improve the choice of an appropriate adjunctive antibiotic for periodontal therapy.
TI  - Bacteriology and beta-lactamase activity in acute and chronic maxillary sinusitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the bacteriology and beta-lactamase enzyme activity in aspirates of 10 acutely and 13 chronically inflamed maxillary sinuses. RESULTS: The predominant organisms isolated in acute sinusitis were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, and those found in chronic sinusitis were Prevotella species, Fusobacterium species, and Peptostreptococcus species. Four beta-lactamase-producing organisms (BLPOs) were isolated in four specimens (40%) obtained from acutely inflamed sinuses, and 14 BLPOs were recovered from 10 chronically inflamed sinuses (77%). The predominant BLPOs in acute sinusitis were H influenzae, and M catarrhalis; those in chronic sinusitis were Staphylococcus aureus, Prevotella species, Fusobacterium species, and Bacteroides fragilis. CONCLUSIONS: Beta-lactamase activity was detected in 12 (three in acute and nine in chronic sinusitis) of the 14 aspirates that contained BLPOs. The detection of beta-lactamase activity in sinus aspirates provides support for the role of BLPOs in the failure of penicillin therapy in sinusitis.
TI  - Associations of endodontic symptoms and signs with particular combinations of specific bacteria.
AB  - Significant associations have been reported between (a) specific bacterial species isolated from root canals and (b) between individual bacterial species and endodontic symptoms and signs. The prime objective of this study was to determine whether particular combinations of specific bacteria are associated with individual endodontic symptoms and signs. Seventy root canals were investigated microbiologically taking care to maintain the viability of obligate anaerobes, which accounted for 64% of the total species isolated, including Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella oralis, Eubacterium aerofaciens, Eubacterium lentum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella buccae and Prevotella intermedia. Significant associations were found between individual clinical features and the following pairs of species: (a) pain (37 cases) and Peptostreptococcus spp./Prevotella spp., Peptostreptococcus spp./Prevotella melaninogenica, Pstr. micros/Prev. melaninogenica (all P < 0.01); (b) swelling (23 cases) and Pstr. micros/Prevotella spp. (P < 0.01); (c) 'Wet' canal (57 cases) and Prevotella spp./Eubacterium spp. (P < 0.01), Peptostreptococcus spp./Eubacterium spp. (P < 0.05). Thus data from this investigation suggests that statistically significant associations exist between individual endodontic symptoms and signs and particular combinations of specific bacteria.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of clarithromycin against clinical isolates].
AB  - To examine the antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin (CAM) against strains clinically isolated from outpatients in 1994, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for CAM and the control drugs. The results were as follows; 1. MIC50 and MIC90 of CAM were similar to those investigated in 1980's against many bacterial species. 2. CAM showed strong antimicrobial activities against beta-lactamase producing Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Bordetella pertussis, Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni and Peptostreptococcus spp. 3. It appears that resistance to MLs including CAM is increasing among Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Pyomyositis in children, caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The author describes the microbiology and clinical features of six pyomyositis infections in children, which yielded anaerobic bacteria. Anaerobic bacteria alone were recovered in four instances, and they are mixed with facultative bacteria in two. There were 15 bacterial isolates (13 anaerobic, 2 facultative). The bacteria were Peptostreptococcus sp (5 isolates), Bacteroides fragilis (3), Clostridium sp (2), Fuso-bacterium nucleatum (1), Prevotella sp (1), Bateroides sp (1), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), and Escherichia coli (1). Recent trauma or injury had occurred in five cases; three such injuries were from penetrating objects. This study highlights the potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in children with pyomyositis.
TI  - Microbiology of mediastinitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the microbiologic and clinical characteristics of patients with mediastinitis. METHODS: Retrospective review of clinical and laboratory data of 17 patients treated between 1980 and 1987. RESULTS: Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in three patients (18%), anaerobic bacteria only in seven (41%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in seven (41%). In total, there were 42 isolates, 13 aerobic or facultative and 29 anaerobic bacteria, an average of 2.5 per specimen. Anaerobic bacteria predominated in infections that originated from esophageal perforation and orofacial, odontogenic, and gunshot sources. The predominant aerobes were alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus (three isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (two isolates), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (two isolates). The predominant anaerobes were Prevotella and Porphyromonas species (eight isolates), Peptostreptococcus species (seven isolates), and Bacteroides fragilis group (three isolates). CONCLUSION: These data highlight the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic nature of mediastinitis.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of infected hemorrhoids.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of infected hemorrhoids. METHODS: Retrospective review of the clinical microbiology records. RESULTS: Aspirates of pus from infected hemorrhoids in 19 patients showed bacterial growth. Anaerobic bacteria only were recovered in six (32%) specimens, aerobic bacteria only in one (5%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 12 (63%). Sixty-eight isolates were recovered: 39 anaerobes (2.1 isolates per specimen) and 29 aerobes (1.5 per specimen). The predominant anaerobes were Bacteroides sp. (13 isolates, including 10 Bacteroides fragilis groups) and 13 Peptostreptococcus sp. The predominant aerobes were Escherichia coli (7), Proteus sp. (5), group D streptococci (4), and Pseudomonas sp. (3). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the polymicrobial nature and predominance of anaerobic bacteria in infected hemorrhoids.
TI  - Susceptibilities of bovine summer mastitis bacteria to antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The susceptibility to 9 antimicrobial agents of 32 aerobic bacterial isolates and to 10 antimicrobial agents of 37 anaerobic bacterial isolates from 23 cases of bovine summer mastitis (16 Actinomyces pyogenes isolates, 8 Streptococcus dysgalactiae isolates, 3 S. uberis isolates, 3 S. acidominimus isolates, 2 Streptococcus spp., 15 Peptostreptococcus indolicus isolates, 10 Fusobacterium necrophorum isolates, and 12 isolates of anaerobic gram-negative rods) was determined by the agar dilution method. All isolates except one Bacteroides fragilis isolate (beta-lactamase producer) were susceptible to penicillin G, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and chloramphenicol (the B. fragilis strain was susceptible to the last four), which had MICs at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (MIC90s) of < or = 0.06, < or = 0.06, < or = 0.06 0.25, < or = 0.06, and 4.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. Spiramycin was active against the gram-positive aerobes (MIC90, 1.0 microgram/ml) but not against the anaerobes (MIC90, 16.0 micrograms/ml). Similar trends were noted for susceptibilities of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to ofloxacin (MIC90s, 2.0 and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively). Occasional strains of aerobic streptococci were resistant to oxytetracycline, but all anaerobes were susceptible. Tinidazole was active against all anaerobes (MIC90, 2.0 micrograms/ml). beta-Lactamase was produced only by the B. fragilis isolate.
TI  - Bacteriological epidemiology and treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - One hundred symptomatic women with clinical bacterial vaginosis (BV) were enrolled in this study. The bacteriological epidemiology of BV and efficacy of oral or vaginal administration of antimicrobial agents for treatment of BV were investigated. The epidemiology of BV was investigated before antimicrobial therapy. Fifty patients were treated with oral administration of metronidazole (MTN), 500 mg twice a day, and 50 patients with 2% clindamycin (CLDM) phosphate in a vaginal cream, 5 g once a day for 7 days. The major organisms occurring were Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus species, Bacteroides species, Prevotella species, and Mobiluncus species and opportunistic pathogens such as Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis. The therapeutic efficacy of CLDM cream on BV appeared to be preferable to oral MTN from clinical and bacteriological aspects. The clinical and bacteriological effectiveness of MTN and CLDM in the treatment of BV suggests that anaerobes might play a major role in causing the clinical symptoms in patients with BV.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. Rationale for clinical use.
AB  - Most Gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500; Synercid). Minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (MIC90) were < or = 1 mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and Listeria monocytogenes. Importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of S. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin G)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. Enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant Enterococcus faecium. E. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. Among the Gram-negative respiratory pathogens Moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and Haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. are resistant. The drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including Clostridium perfringens, Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus. Synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant E. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus with the combination of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. Quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus infection in rabbits, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. The drug is rapidly bactericidal against Gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the MIC, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Macrolides resistance of common bacteria isolated from Taiwan.
AB  - To determine the susceptibility to macrolides of common pathogenic bacteria isolated from Taiwan, the in vitro activities of erythromycin, roxithromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and dirithromycin were tested against 492 clinical isolates of eight different bacteria, collected from the National Taiwan University Hospital. The results showed high minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against most of the tested bacteria. The MIC90s for Staphylococcus aureus (both methicillin-resistant and -sensitive strains), coagulase-negative staphylococci (both methicillin-resistant and -sensitive strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococci, peptostreptococci, and Bacteroides fragilis were all > or = 256 micrograms/ml. The MIC50s for methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, and enterococci were > or = 256 micrograms/ml. For S. pneumoniae, peptostreptococci, and B. fragilis, the MIC50s were > 8 micrograms/ml. The resistance rates to macrolides were 80% or more in methicillin-resistant staphylococci and about 30% in methicillin-sensitive staphylococci. Around 55% of S. pneumoniae strains and 37 approximately 42% of S. pyogenes strains were resistant to macrolides. Cross-resistance to different macrolides was clearly demonstrated in most of the resistant strains.
TI  - Endodontic pathogens: propagation of infection through patent dentinal tubules in traumatized monkey teeth.
AB  - Periapical pathology indicating endodontic infection, when present in marginal periodontitis-affected teeth, has recently been shown to be an aggravating factor in progression of marginal destruction. This has been associated with patency of dentinal tubules in the tooth cervix, an area normally devoid of cementum following periodontal therapy. These studies are, however hampered by that only circumstantial evidence such as presence of periapical destruction have been applied as criteria of endodontic infection. The purpose of the present investigation was to study to what extent a predefined selection of endodontic pathogens inoculated in the root canal can influence periodontal pathology and healing in areas of the root covered by or devoid of cementum, using root resorption as a histomorphometric marker. Exposed dentine surfaces, in the present study showed significantly larger areas of resorption in infected roots compared to non-infected roots, while cementum surfaces showed an almost identical distribution of tissue reactions regardless of root canal infection or not. It was concluded that endodontic pathogens or their products were not able to penetrate the cementum barrier. The significantly larger areas of resorption on exposed dentine surfaces in infected roots compared to non-infected roots indicated that endodontic pathogens or their products could spread through dentinal tubules to a root surface void of cementum. Extrapolated to the marginal situation this indicated that endodontic pathogens in the root canal might be able to aggravate marginal infection in areas of root devoid of cementum.
TI  - Microbiological features and pathogenesis of peritonsillar abscesses.
AB  - Samples of pus aspirated from 53 peritonsillar abscesses were examined in detail  for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and the microbiological results correlated with clinical data in 44 cases. In 45 samples (85%) cultures were positive: 7 yielded organisms consistent with an aerobic infection, mainly Lancefield group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (5/7), and 38 yielded organisms consistent with an anaerobic infection. The anaerobic infections were usually mixed, but in two cases Fusobacterium necrophorum was isolated in pure culture. Peptostreptococcus micros and Streptococcus milleri were the predominant isolates in this group. Direct Gram stain smear and gas-liquid chromatography were useful indicators of the type of infection present. Samples from ten patients (18.9%) grew one or more beta-lactamase-producing isolates. Of the 25 patients prescribed antibiotics by their general practitioners prior to admission, 18 received one or more beta-lactam antibiotics. Most cases of peritonsillar abscess were due to mixed anaerobic infections, Lancefield group A beta-haemolytic streptococci playing a central role in only a minority of cases. In light of these findings and the possibility of infection with beta-lactamase-producing isolates, it is suggested that the first-line antibiotic therapy in this group of patients should include a chemotherapeutic agent directed against anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial and toxic effects of established and potential root canal irrigants.
AB  - Three dilutions of the commonly used irrigant sodium hypochlorite (0.5%, 2.5%, and 5.25%) and the potential irrigants Peridex, chlorhexidine gluconate (0.12%), and Therasol were tested. Alcohol and saline served as controls also. The in vitro portion of this study used four different microorganisms (Streptococcus mutans, Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella intermedius, and Porphyromonas gingivalis) to determine antimicrobial effect. Presterilized 7-mm diameter Whatman paper disks soaked with the test solution were prepared, and disks were placed onto the previously seeded agar petri dishes. Each dish was incubated aerobically or anaerobically according to the microorganisms used. An in vivo animal model (guinea pig) was used to examine subcutaneous local tissue reactions using the same materials; 0.1 ml of each test solution was injected subcutaneously into predetermined locations on the animal dorsum. Test site histological examination was done 2 h, 2 days, and 2 wk after the injections. The results of this comparative study indicate Peridex (chlorhexidine gluconate) and Therasol may have good potential for endodontic usage.
TI  - Antimicrobial Activity of SCH 27899, Oligosaccharide Member of the Everninomycin  Class with a Wide Gram-Positive Spectrum.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of SCH 27899 (everninomycin), a novel oligosaccharide compound of the everninomycin class, was compared with vancomycin, chloramphenicol, clinafloxacin, teicoplanin and doxycycline against 428 clinical strains of bacteria. Everninomycin base exhibited the greatest antimicrobial activity compared to other formulations against all strains tested (MIC90: 0.25 microg/ml) followed by clinafloxacin and teicoplanin (MIC90: 0.5 microg/ml), vancomycin (MIC90: 2 microg/ml), and doxycycline (MIC90: 16 microg/ml). Everninomycin demonstrated the best activity against Streptococcus spp. (serogroups A, B, C, F, G) and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and lower activity against coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC90: 0.5 microg/ml). All enterococci had an everninomycin MIC of 0.5 microg/ml or less. Everninomycin had no measurable antimicrobial activity against gram-negative aerobic organisms except Flavobacterium meningosepticum (MIC50: 2 microg/ml). Some everninomycin activity was observed against Clostridium spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., and the Prevotella bivius-disiens group. Everninomycin showed excellent activity (MIC90: 0.25 microg/ml) against the fluoroquinolone-resistant strains and all gram-positive strains resistant to vancomycin (MICs less-than-or-equal 4 microg/ml). The MBC/MIC ratios and killing curve data suggest that everninomycin is not uniformly or rapidly bactericidal. These in vitro data indicate that everninomycin could be useful against emerging gram-positive strains resistant to other contemporary antimicrobials.
TI  - Multiple ligand interactions for bacterial immunoglobulin-binding proteins on human and murine cells of the hematopoetic lineage.
AB  - A group of bacterial Ig-binding surface proteins were studied: protein H and M1 are from Streptococcus pyogenes and interact with IgG, protein L is expressed by Peptostreptococcus magnus and shows affinity for Ig light chains, whereas protein LG is a chimeric construction combining the binding properties of protein L with the IgG-binding activity of protein G from group C and G streptococci. Proteins L and H coupled to Sepharose were mitogenic for human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and mouse splenic B cells, but not when added in soluble form. Differentiation to Ig secretion was induced by protein H-Sepharose in mouse splenic B cells but not in human PBLs. In FACS analysis FITC-labelled protein H stained virtually all CD19+ cells in human peripheral blood as well as a majority of the CD3+ population. Protein L bound the majority of the CD19+ population, but also a fraction of the CD19-/CD3 population. Protein M1 was not mitogenic but stained the entire CD19+ population and 70% of the CD3+ population. Identical staining patterns were observed with mouse splenocytes using B220 and T-cells receptor as lineage markers. The chimeric protein LG was a potent mitogen for mouse splenic B cells when added either coupled to Sepharose or in soluble form. In addition, protein LG induced differentiation to Ig secretion of the responding mouse splenic B cells. In FACS analysis, protein LG stained the entire CD19+ and the majority of the CD19-/CD3 lymphocyte population as well as all B220+ mouse splenocytes and a fraction of the splenic T cells. These data indicate that the bacterial proteins studied interact with surface structures of several leucocyte populations and can hence interfere with the immune system at multiple levels.
TI  - An approach to efficacy screening of mouthrinses: studies on a group of French products (I). Staining and antimicrobial properties in vitro.
AB  - There is a large and increasing number of oral hygiene products available to the  general public. As such, it is difficult to demonstrate efficacy for all in long-term home-use studies. The aim of this project was to determine whether screening studies could position the activity and efficacy of a number of antiseptic mouthrinses, available in France, by comparison with an established product. This study reports the experiments in vitro. The products under test were, 4 containing chlorhexidine (Eludril, Hibident, Parodex and Prexidine) with Hibident considered the positive control, one containing cetylpyridinium chloride (Alodont) and one containing hexetidine (Hextril). The 1st study determined the antibacterial profile of the chlorhexidine products against a panel of oral bacteria using an agar dilution method. The 2nd study recorded, by optical density, the propensity of all products to induce tea staining on clear acrylic specimens. The maximum inhibitory dilution (MID) of the chlorhexidine products against the test organisms, once adjusted for initial concentration differences, were essentially similar. One exception was Eludril which had an increased MID against Capnocytophaga sputigena, an organism normally less sensitive to chlorhexidine. Hibident and Prexidine produced expected levels of tea staining; that produced by Parodex was lower than the expected. Staining by Eludril was little different than water controls suggesting markedly reduced availability of chlorhexidine in this product.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Endodontic pathogens in periodontal disease augmentation.
AB  - Periapical pathology indicating endodontic infection, when present in periodontitis-affected teeth, has recently been shown to be correlated to marginal periodontal breakdown. This has been associated with patency of dentinal tubules in the tooth cervix, an area normally devoid of cementum following periodontal therapy. These studies are, however hampered by that only circumstantial evidence such as presence of periapical destruction have been applied as criteria of endodontic infection. The aim of the present investigation was to assess the effects of endodontic pathogens on marginal periodontal wound healing on root surfaces devoid of cementum but surrounded by healthy periodontal membrane. Significant differences between infected and non-infected teeth were found with respect to pathological pocket and connective tissue: The experimental defects were covered by approximately 20% more pocket epithelium in infected teeth while defects in non-infected teeth showed approximately 10% more connective tissue coverage. It was concluded, that an intra-canal infection of endodontic pathogens stimulates epithelial downgrowth along denuded dentin surfaces with marginal communication. Extrapolated to the clinical situation, endodontic infections in periodontitis-prone patients may augment periodontitis propagation.
TI  - Structures of bacterial immunoglobulin-binding domains and their complexes with immunoglobulins.
AB  - Three-dimensional structures are now available for several immunoglobulin binding domains from bacterial proteins A, G, and L. X-ray diffraction and NMR experiments on complexes of these domains with portions of immunoglobulins have revealed common structural themes used in these interactions. These data expand our understanding of structure/function relationships in these molecular recognition processes and provide the basis for rational design of artificial immunoglobulin-binding molecules.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  - In addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. This investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol, Super EBA and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria Streptococcus fecalis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus species, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli B and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, Prevotella (Bacteroides) buccae, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella (Bacteroides) intermedia, Prevotella (Bacteroides) melaninogenica, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. After growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees C. Impregnated discs with the Super EBA liquid were used as positive controls. The antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and Scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials. Impregnated discs with Super EBA liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. Both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. Mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. Zinc oxide-eugenol and Super EBA pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Mapping of the immunoglobulin light chain-binding site of protein L.
AB  - Protein L is a cell surface protein expressed by some strains of the anaerobic bacterial species Peptostreptococcus magnus. The molecule binds specifically and with high affinity to immunoglobulins (Ig) of a wide range of animal species. The Ig-binding activity is mediated through five highly homologous domains, each 72 to 76 amino acid residues long, which interact with framework regions in the variable domain of Ig light chains. The interaction does not interfere with the antigen binding capacity of the antibody. The fold of the Ig light chain-binding domains of Protein L is comprised of an alpha-helix packed against a four stranded beta-sheet and is similar to the fold of the IgG heavy chain-binding domains of streptococcal protein G, despite the fact that the two proteins show no significant sequence homology. In the present work, heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy has been utilized to define the interaction between the N-terminal Ig-binding domain of Protein L and the variable domain of a human Ig kappa light chain. The Ig-binding region of the Protein L domain involves most of the residues in the second beta-strand, the C-terminal residues of the alpha-helix and the loop connecting the alpha-helix with the third beta-strand. The Ig light chain-binding surface of Protein L thus resembles the surface of Protein G which binds to the C gamma 1 domain of IgG, but is different from the portion of Protein G involved in the contact with the C gamma 2-C gamma 3 interface region. The data suggest that the global fold shared by the Ig-binding domains of Proteins L and G provide bacteria with a flexible template for the evolution of surface structures capable of interacting with different conserved parts of Ig molecules of the infected host.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of Ruminococcus flavefaciens, the type species of the genus Ruminococcus, does not support the reclassification of Streptococcus hansenii and Peptostreptococcus productus as ruminococci.
AB  - The 16S rRNA gene sequence of the type strain of Ruminococcus flavefaciens, the type species of the genus Ruminococcus, was determined by PCR direct sequencing. A comparative sequence analysis showed that R. flavefaciens is phylogenetically related to a small cluster (cluster IV of Collins et al. [M. D. Collins, P. A. Lawson, A. Willems, J. J. Cordoba, J. Fernandez-Garayzabal, P. Garcia, J. Cai, H. Hippe, and J. A. E. Farrow, Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 44:812-826, 1994]) of organisms which includes several Clostridium and Eubacterium species. R. flavefaciens was found to be phylogenetically only remotely related to Ruminococcus gnavus, Ruminococcus torques, Peptostreptococcus productus, and Streptococcus hansenii. These findings demonstrate that the genus Ruminococcus is not a monophyletic group, and the proposed transfer of P. productus and S. hansenii to this genus (T. Ezaki, N. Li, Y. Hashimoto, H. Miura, and H. Yamamoto, Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 44:130-136, 1994) is not supported.
TI  - Bacteremia in conjunction with endodontic therapy.
AB  - This study characterizes oral microorganisms believed to have spread from the root canal into the blood stream during and after endodontic therapy of teeth with Asymptomatic apical periodontitis. Microbiological samples were taken under aseptic conditions from the root canal of 26 single-rooted teeth in 26 patients. In the endodontic treatment of 13 of the patients (Group 1), the first 3 reamers, sizes 15, 20 and 25, were used to a level 2 mm beyond the apical foramen. In the other 13 patients (Group 2), the instrumentation ended inside the root canal 1 mm short of the apical foramen. Blood samples were taken from the patients during the instrumentation and 10 min after the treatment was completed. Anaerobic microorganisms were isolated from all root canals. In 7 patients of Group 1, Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were recovered from the blood. In 4 patients of Group 2, P. intermedia, Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus intermedius and Streptococcus sanguis were isolated from the blood. Biochemical tests and antibiograms revealed that the isolates from the root canal and blood had identical profiles within the patients, strongly suggesting that the microorganisms isolated from the blood had the root canal as their source.
TI  - Factors affecting the occurrence of bacteremia associated with tooth extraction.
AB  - This study examined the factors that affect the occurrence of bacteremia associated with tooth extraction and the kinds of bacteria causing this bacteremia. Bacteremia was found in 132 (72.1%) of 183 patients who had one or more teeth extracted for various reasons. Bacteremia occurred more frequently when teeth were extracted because of inflammatory dental diseases. The occurrence of bacteremia also increased with the number of teeth extracted and the age of the patients. When the volume of blood lost during surgery was > 50 ml and the time required for the operation exceeded 100 min, the occurrence of bacteremia was also higher. Anaerobes were isolated from 104 (78.8%) of the 132 cases of bacteremia. Of the 187 isolates obtained, three (1.6%) were aerobes, 51 (27.3%) were facultative anaerobes (including microaerophils), and 133 (71.1%) were anaerobes. Among facultative anaerobes and microaerophils, the most frequently isolated bacterial genera were Lactobacillus (n = 15), Streptococcus (n = 13), and Staphylococcus (n = 12); and among anaerobes, Eubacterium (n = 40), Peptostreptococcus (n = 40), and Propionibacterium (n = 20).
TI  - The microbiology and antibiotic treatment of peritonsillar abscesses.
AB  - Pus from 53 peritonsillar abscesses was cultured and associations between the microbiological results and clinical data were investigated with the aim of developing a clinical protocol for treatment. A positive culture grew in 85% of quinsies and of these 16% produced aerobes and 84% anaerobes. Penicillin-resistant organisms were grown from 32% of patients and all but one of these organisms (Haemophilus influenzae) was sensitive to metronidazole. There was no association between clinical presentation and cultured organism which could guide treatment, hence we recommend penicillin and metronidazole as the antibiotic regimen of choice in the treatment of peritonsillar abscesses because of its effectiveness in 98% of patients.
TI  - Bacteriology of skin and soft-tissue infections: comparison of infections in intravenous drug users and individuals with no history of intravenous drug use.
AB  - The bacteriology of cutaneous or subcutaneous abscesses (86 specimens) among intravenous drug users (IVDUs) was compared with the bacteriology of abscesses (74 specimens) in patients with no history of intravenous drug use (non-IVDUs). The IVDU abscesses yielded 173 aerobes and 131 anaerobes. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common aerobe isolated (50% of specimens yielded this isolate), followed by "Streptococcus milleri" (46%). The commonly encountered anaerobes were Fusobacterium nucleatum (17%), pigmented Prevotella species (22%), Peptostreptococcus micros (17%), Actinomyces odontolyticus (15%), and Veillonella species (13%). The non-IVDU isolates included 116 aerobes and 106 anaerobes. S. aureus was isolated from 53% of these specimens, followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci (19%), "S. milleri" (19%), and Streptococcus pyogenes (16%). The main groups of anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus species (35%), Bacteroides species (19%), and gram-positive bacilli (31%). Overall, 67% of the IVDU isolates were of oral origin, compared with 25% of the non-IVDU isolates. Of the specimens from IVDUs and non-IVDUs, 48% and 67%, respectively, yielded only aerobes, and 2% and 4%, respectively, yielded only anaerobes. Sixty-four percent of the patients had one or more beta-lactamase-producing organisms.
TI  - A retrospective review of cases of anaerobic empyema and update of bacteriology.
AB  - We conducted a retrospective study to update the bacteriology of 46 cases of anaerobic empyema that were originally studied between 1976 and 1993 at the Wadsworth Anaerobic Bacteriology Clinical Research Laboratory (Los Angeles). Anaerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for all 46 pleural fluid specimens, and aerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for 41 of these specimens. Thirty-seven clinical charts were available for review. A total of 161 anaerobic isolates (3.5 per patient) representing 64 species or groups were recovered. The most common isolates were as follows: Fusobacterium nucleatum (19); Prevotella oris-buccae group (13, 9 of which were P. oris); Bacteroides fragilis group (11, 4 of which were B. fragilis); pigmented Prevotella species (17, 8 of which were in the Prevotella intermedia-nigrescens group); Peptostreptococcus species (17, 9 of which were Peptostreptococcus micros); Eubacterium species (7); Lactobacillus species (8); Actinomyces species (7); and Clostridium species (7). Nineteen if the cases were of purely anaerobic etiology; of these, eight were caused by a single organism: F. nucleatum (five cases); B. fragilis (two cases); and Prevotella mangus (one case). Of the 45 aerobic isolates (1.1 per patient), viridans streptococci were most common (21 isolates), followed by group D nonenterococcal streptococcus (four isolates). Only nine gram-negative rods (six enteric and three nonenteric organisms) and one Staphylococcus aureus isolate were recovered. The susceptibility to penicillin of 64 isolates was examined with the use of the spiral gradient method; 21 (33%) of these isolates were beta-lactamase positive (MICs ranged from 1.1 to > or = 54 micrograms/mL vs < or = 0.27 micrograms/mL for beta-lactamase-negative strains).
TI  - Bacteriology of chronic otitis media, chronic sinusitis, and paranasal mucopyocele in Japan.
AB  - A bacteriologic study of cases of chronic otitis media, chronic sinusitis, and paranasal mucopyocele diagnosed at Gifu University Hospital was performed between 1989 and 1992. Bacteria were isolated from all of 13 samples of discharge from the ears of patients with chronic otitis media, all of 14 mucosal biopsy specimens from patients with chronic sinusitis, 8 of 10 aspirate samples from patients with chronic sinusitis, and 9 of 15 aspirates samples from patients with mucopyocele. Cultures often yielded polymicrobial growth, with an average of 3.1, 3.8, and 4.2 species per positive specimen from chronic otitis media, chronic sinusitis, and mucopyocele, respectively. The most commonly encountered anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus, Propionibacterium, and Prevotella species; the most common aerobes were Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species. One strain of Prevotella melaninogenica highly resistant to ampicillin and two strains of Peptostreptococcus resistant to cefaclor were found.
TI  - Surgical sepsis: constancy of antibiotic susceptibility of causative organisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is well documented that antibiotic therapy exerts selective pressure on bacteria. Conversion of bacteria from susceptible to resistant to antibiotics has been observed often during antimicrobial therapy. It has been postulated that human intestinal reservoirs facilitate communication of transposons that can transfer resistance determinants among various bacterial species. METHODS: This study examined the susceptibilities of organisms isolated from infected abdomens to a number of antibiotic agents during a 12-year time interval. Analysis included 1102 isolates recovered from 255 specimens, representing the following genera: Bacteroides, Clostridium, Gemella, Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Pseudomonas, and Enterobacteriaceae. Strains were tested against beta-lactam agents, beta-lactams in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, first, second, and third generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, clindamycin, metronidazole, chloramphenicol, and imipenem. RESULTS: The results indicated that during a time period of more than a decade essentially no change occurred in the antibiotic susceptible fraction of all species tested. CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal sepsis is caused by leakage of endogenous intestinal flora. This study suggests that the intestinal flora is not permanently affected by short-term antibiotic therapy and that older antibiotics are appropriate first-line therapeutic agents for community-acquired infections caused by normal intestinal flora.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of cefmenoxime against recent fresh clinical isolates from patients in sinusitis].
AB  - In order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (CMX), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CMX and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates from patients of sinusitis that were obtained in our laboratory from October of 1993 to March of 1994. The results are summarized as follows; 1. CMX showed strong antimicrobial activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis that were 3 major aerobic bacteria from sinusitis. Antimicrobial activities of CMX against benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP) and PCG-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) were stronger than those of ampicillin (ABPC), and these strong activities suggested that CMX might have strong antimicrobial activities against beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae and M. (B.) catarrhalis. 2. Antimicrobial activities of CMX against microaerophiles, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus intermedius and Gemella morbillorum and against Peptostreptococcus spp., from chronic sinusitis and odontogenic maxillary sinusitis, were stronger than those of most of the control drugs. 3. The MIC90's of CMX against isolates from patients of sinusitis were < or = 0.025-0.39 micrograms/ml. These values were lower than transitional concentrations in mucous membrane of maxillary sinus obtained when "1% CMX nasal solution" was used with nebulizer. It appears likely that sufficient concentrations exceeding MICs against main organisms would be obtained by nebulizer treatment using CMX nasal solution.
TI  - Intracranial complications of sinusitis in childhood.
AB  - Complications of sinusitis in children, such as intracranial abscess formation, are uncommon and are often clinically unremarkable in comparison to similar disease processes in adults. Between 1983 and 1991, 443 children were admitted to Children's National Medical Center in Washington, DC, for treatment of sinusitis. Fourteen of these children presented with intracranial extension of the infection and abscess formation. A retrospective review of these patients revealed that the risk of developing an intracranial abscess secondary to sinusitis was 3%. The management of these patients included surgical drainage of the infected sinuses and intracranial surgical exploration. Cranialization and exenteration of the frontal sinus proved to be effective single-stage procedures. While not indicated in all patients, these procedures eliminated the sinus as a source of continued or potential infection and obviated the need for a second obliterative procedure. Combined antimicrobial therapy and surgical drainage should be the management protocol.
TI  - Nonpuerperal breast infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We undertook a microbiological study of purulent specimens from women  with symptomatic breast abscesses. METHODS: Fifty-one purulent samples were collected in 2 periods (December 1991-April 1992 and January 1994-June 1994) from nonpuerperal breast abscesses in 44 patients attending our hospital. RESULTS: One of the most frequently isolated microorganisms was Proteus mirabilis (9 patients, 20.4%), present as a pure culture in all but 1 specimen (isolated together with Peptostreptococcus spp.). Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 10 specimens, 6 of which were post-tumorectomy abscesses. Polymicrobial anaerobic flora were isolated in 11 specimens (21.5%); Staphylococcus epidermidis in 4 (8%); and Streptococcus milleri,Alcaligenes sp., and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 1 specimen each. The 7 remaining samples (13.7%) were negative bacteriological cultures. CONCLUSIONS: We draw attention to the frequent isolation of P. mirabilis in recurrent and torpid breast abscesses in 4 women in whom surgery was necessary in addition to antibiotic treatment.
TI  - [Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in acute abdominal illnesses].
AB  - 366 specinmens taken from patients suffering from acute abdominal illnesses who had undergone operations were examined. Bacterial pathogens were isolated from 318 specimens. Aerobic bacteria were isolated from 53.8% specimens. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 12.6% specimens. Mixed bacterial flora were isolated from 33.6% specimens. Among aerobic bacteria E. coli and Streptococcus faecalis were most often isolated. Among anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Peptococcus spp. were most often seen.
TI  - Sinusitis and bronchial asthma in children.
AB  - Sinus disease has been assumed to exist in children with respiratory tract allergies. We consecutively evaluated 375 patients (245 male, 130 female) with childhood onset asthma, between 5 and 15 years of age (mean 7.8 years of age). Abnormal Waters radiographs were found in 205 patients (54.7%) which included mucosal wall thickening greater than 6 mm (67.3%), complete opacification (22.9%) and air-fluid levels (9.8%). The level of immunoglobulin (Ig) E was found to be much higher in non-sinusitis asthmatic children than in asthmatic children with sinusitis (1207 IU/mL vs. 644 IU/mL). The IgG, IgA, IgM and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) values were not significantly different in the two groups. All patients were treated with antibiotics for 3 to 6 weeks. Five patients required surgical intervention after antibiotic treatment had little success. Streptococcus viridans was isolated from 4 patients following surgical aspirates and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius was isolated in only one patient. In conclusion, sinusitis in children may be an aggravating factor for chronic reactive lower airway disease. Optimal treatment may decrease the need of asthmatic medication.
TI  - On the interaction between single chain Fv antibodies and bacterial immunoglobulin-binding proteins.
AB  - Using four bacterial immunoglobulin-binding proteins, we have analyzed the binding characteristics of a panel of 34 human single chain Fv antibodies, expressed in E. coli and with known specificity and sequence. Several of the single chain Fv antibodies showed affinity for staphylococcal protein A and peptostreptococcal protein L, but not for the streptococcal proteins G or H. The affinity of the binding was higher for protein L (4.5 and 1.4 x 10(9) M-1) than for protein A (7.7 and 6.7 x 10(8) M-1), using the two single chain Fv antibodies displaying the strongest binding activity to these ligands. The binding was shown to be specific by Western blotting, and the single chain Fv antibodies could be purified from crude bacterial culture media by affinity chromatography on protein L- or A-Sepharose. Protein A, which has affinity for the VH domain of the scFv antibodies, was tested against scFv antibodies containing VH1, VH3, VH4 and VH5 domains, and its binding was restricted to approximately half of the scFv antibodies with a VH3 domain. Protein L, which has affinity for the VL domain, was tested against kappa 1, kappa 4, lambda 1, lambda 2 and lambda 3 domains, and it bound all kappa 1 domains, one lambda 2 and one lambda 3 domain. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of binding and non-binding VL domains demonstrated that amino acid residues crucial to the binding of protein L were distributed over a large area outside the hypervariable antigen-binding regions.
TI  - Microbiota of rapidly progressive periodontitis lesions in association with clinical parameters.
AB  - The microbial population in 73 rapidly progressive periodontitis (RPP) lesions in 10 young adults aged 25 to 35 years (5 males, 5 females) was studied in relation to the clinical parameters probing depth, bleeding on probing, and suppuration, which were recorded at the sampled sites. Porphyromonas gingivalis was found to predominate (26.7%) in 73 periodontal lesions with clinical probing depth > 6 mm, followed by Bacteroides forsythus (23.6%), and Prevotella intermedia (15.7%). The prevalence of P. gingivalis was 91.7%, Fusobacterium nucleatum, 90.4%; Streptococcus intermedius, 87.7%; and B. forsythus, 53.4%. Significant differences between bleeding index 0, 1, and 2 (P < 0.05) in frequency of detection were found for P. intermedia, Campylobacter concisus, Selenomonas sputigena, and Peptostreptococcus micros at bleeding sites and for Streptococcus sanguis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and B. forsythus (P < 0.001) at non-bleeding sites. Between suppurating and non-suppurating sites, significant differences (P < 0.05) in frequency of isolation were found for P. intermedia, Capnocytophaga ochracea, and A. actinomycetemcomitans at suppurating sites and for F. nucleatum at non-suppurating sites.
TI  - [An evaluation of pathogens in patients with bronchopulmonary infection by transtracheal aspiration: December 1978-March 1993].
AB  - We performed transtracheal aspiration (TTA) in 1165 patients, who were suspected  to have bronchopulmonary infection, from December 1978 to March 1993. We isolated pathogens from TTA in 806 patients (69.2%). We isolated H. influenzae (62 cases), S. pneumoniae (39 cases) and M. catarrhalis (24 cases) in patients with acute bronchitis, S. pneumoniae (65 cases), alpha-Streptococcus sp. (52 cases), H. influenzae (32 cases) and S. aureus (29 cases) in patients with pneumonia or lung abscess and H. influenzae (174 cases), S. pneumoniae (84 cases), P. aeruginosa (81 cases) and M. catarrhalis (42 cases) in patients with chronic lower respiratory tract infection. Anaerobic bacteria isolated from TTA included Peptostreptococcus sp. (19 cases), Bacteroides sp. (19 cases) and others. Mycoplasma pneumoniae was isolated from TTA in 8 patients with pneumonia without other organisms. Virus isolated from TTA included Rhinovirus (6 cases) and others. These results suggest that various pathogens affect the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary infection. Therefore, we must diagnose the bronchopulmonary infection by the correct methods such as TTA.
TI  - Evaluation of minocycline and cefuzonam for antimicrobial activity against clinical isolates.
AB  - The Antibacterial activity of minocycline (MINO) and that of cefuzonam (CZON) were assessed with clinical isolates of 19 species, and compared with that of other antibiotics. MINO was highly active against methicilli-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Flavobacterium meningosepticum, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Propionibacterium acnes, but not as effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. CZON was highly active against MSSA, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, N. Gonorrhoeae, M(B). catarrhalis, H. influenzae, H. pylori, P. mirabilis, Peptostreptococcus spp. and P. acnes, but not effective against MRSA. It was minimally active against Gram-negative rods (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, etc.) and bacteria that do not ferment glucose.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of essential oils and essential oil components towards oral bacteria.
AB  - A method for reproducibly determining minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations of plant extracts towards fastidiously and facultatively anaerobic oral bacteria, predicated upon measurements of optical densities in microtitre plate wells, was devised. The antimicrobial properties of some botanical oils were surveyed; of these, Australian tea tree oil, peppermint oil, and sage oil proved to be the most potent essential oils, whereas thymol and eugenol were potent essential oil components.
TI  - The clinical importance of gram-positive anaerobic cocci isolated at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, in 1987.
AB  - The clinical importance of the gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC) isolated in 1987 at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, is assessed. Of about 800 anaerobic isolates, 209 (27%) were GPAC, of which 67 (32%) were from abscesses and 22 (11%) were in pure growth. Four species comprised 77% of the 168 isolates available for study: Peptostreptococcus magnus (55 isolates, 33%), P. micros (23, 14%), P. asaccharolyticus (24, 14%) P. asaccharolyticus (24, 14%) and P. anaerobius (27, 16%). Different species were associated with different sites, from P. magnus (usually skin-associated sites; normally cultured with aerobes, infrequently with other anaerobes), P. asaccharolyticus (distributed widely) and P. anaerobius (usually genitourinary and gastrointestinal; always below the diaphragm) to P. micros (always deep sites with other anaerobes). P. magnus was isolated from 15 abscesses and was obtained in pure culture from 11 specimens, six of them abscesses developing from infected sebaceous cysts. P. micros was usually isolated from soft tissue abscesses, never from the skin, and with a characteristic mixed flora consisting of "Streptococcus milleri" and anaerobic gram-negative rods. P. heliotrinreducens was a rare isolate from similar specimens. P. asaccharolyticus was cultured from a wide variety of sites, typically mixed with both aerobes and anaerobes, and frequently from abscesses. Most isolates of P. anaerobius came from gastrointestinal or female genitourinary specimens, never from above the diaphragm and rarely from the skin; cultures were usually heavily mixed. Isolates of P. vaginalis and the "bGAL" group made up 11% of str ains and were usally cultured from superficial sites, P. vaginalis often from post-operative wound infections with Staphylococcus aureus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis. A prospective study using ultrasound-guided transthoracic needle aspiration.
AB  - Obstructive pneumonitis, the opacity that develops distal to an obstructing endobronchial lesion or external compression, is actually a combination of atelectasis, bronchiectasis with mucus plugging, and true parenchymal inflammation. In the majority of cases, it is usually not possible to determine whether infection is present or not from the radiographic findings alone. The aim of this study was to evaluate the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis and the influence of this result on the treatment of patients. From March 1992 to February 1993, 26 consecutive patients (20 men and six women) with obstructive pneumonitis were investigated. The obstructive pneumonitis had been caused by malignant tumors in 24 and benign lesions in two. Chest ultrasound (US) and US-guided percutaneous transthoracic aspirations were undergone to obtain specimens for microbiologic examination. Microorganisms were isolated from seven of nine febrile patients and two of 17 nonfebrile patients. A total of 16 bacterial strains are detected in obstructive pneumonitis (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, viridant streptococci, Bacteroides fragilis, two Peptostreptococcus species, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Streptococcus sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides thetaiotamomicrons, Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides species, Veillonella species, aerobic gram-positive bacilli, and Escherichia coli). In five cases the isolates were monobacteriae, and in the remaining four cases, cultures yielded more than one bacteria. The results of aspirate cultures led to changes in the initial antibiotic trial in seven of nine patients, and fever subsided thereafter. Pneumothorax occurred in one cases as the sole complication. The pathogen causing obstructive pneumonitis is very heterogeneous, and polymicrobial infection is common.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Changes in root canal microbiota during the development of rat periapical lesions.
AB  - Periapical lesions are reproducibly induced in rats by pulp exposure and infection from the oral cavity. Lesions expand rapidly between day 7 and day 15-20 (active phase), with slowed expansion thereafter. In the present study we characterized the root canal microbiota present during the active phase of lesion development in this system. The mandibular first molars of Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed on day 0. The teeth were extracted after 7 days (n = 10 animals) and 15 days (n = 10), and the microbiota present in roots was isolated and characterized. The number of colonies isolated per tooth was similar on day 7 (1.53 +/- 0.64 colony-forming units x 10(3)) and day 15 (1.49 +/- 0.37 colony-forming units x 10(3)). No colonies were isolated from unexposed control teeth. Anaerobic bacteria increased significantly between day 7 (24.3 +/- 5.7%) and day 15 (47.3 +/- 7.5%), and the proportion of gram-negative organisms increased from day 7 (24.3 +/- 6.1) to day 15 (46.9 +/- 6.8). The predominant bacteria included, on day 7: Streptococcus and Bacteroides species; on day 15: species of Streptococcus, Bacteroides, Prevotella, Neisseria and Peptostreptococcus. Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus rattus, Bacteroides pneumosintes and Bacteroides ureolyticus were frequently isolated at both points. Although approximately the same mean number of different species (approximately 3.5) was isolated per tooth on both day 7 and 15, the overall diversity of the isolates increased on day 15.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro comparison of the effectiveness of three surface disinfectants.
AB  - Choosing a general purpose surface disinfectant for the dental office environment is difficult because of the wide range of products available, varying claims by manufacturers and contradictory reports in the literature regarding product efficacy. This study tested the antimicrobial effectiveness of diluted-for-use O-phenyl-phenol (Omni), didecyl dimethyl ammonium (Basic G) and isopropanol (Virahol). Products were tested for antimicrobial activity at 0, 12 and 24 hours, 3, 6 and 8 days. O-phenyl-phenol demonstrated essentially no antibacterial effect against any of eleven test microorganisms. Didecyl dimethyl ammonium and the isopropanol reagent both demonstrated statistically significant killing activity against all organisms. More importantly, these two products maintained their antimicrobial activity up to 8 days after preparation.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, FK037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between January 1992 and June 1993. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for Streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for Peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis. FK037 was superior in potency to ceftazidime against all strains except E. faecalis, P. anaerobius and P. bivia. It was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and P. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. FK037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against MRSA, S. agalactiae and E. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except G. vaginalis and B. fragilis that were 4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to FK037.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of cefuroxime against recent clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of cefuroxime axetil (CXM-AX) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains obtained mainly from outpatients of our center in a period from January to September of 1990 and 1993. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined and the following results were obtained. 1. The results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, MIC80 of CXM were equal to or lower against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Peptostreptococcus spp., and Propionibacterium acnes, except for Streptococcus pneumoniae, MIC80 which was slightly higher. 2. MIC90 of comparator drugs reflected those of new resistant organisms recently appeared, such as benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP), cephem-resistant E. coli and Klebsiella spp., new quinolone-resistant H. influenzae and N. gonorrhoeae. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was detected also from specimens of community acquired infections. From the nature of MRSA detected in those situations MRSA appeared to present a continuing problem. 3. MIC90 against strains obtained from patients with community acquired infections was a good index of increases of multidrug-resistant organisms in the past. Therefore, the determination of MIC90 is important in examining changes with time of sensitivities or resistances of clinically isolated strains to antimicrobial drugs. 4. Antimicrobial activities of CXM against recent clinical isolates showed the existence of problems as mentioned above. However, MIC of CXM as well as those of comparator drugs indicated that antimicrobial activities of CXM against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., H. influenzae appeared to be relatively strong, and it is concluded that cefuroxime axetil still is one of the clinically useful oral antimicrobial drugs in the 1990's.
TI  - Impaired bactericidal activity of PMN from two brothers with necrotizing ulcerative gingivo-periodontitis.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the pathogenesis of necrotizing ulcerative gingivo-periodontitis (ANUP) diagnosed in two brothers, age 9 (ANUP1) and 14 (ANUP2) from rural Egypt. Complete blood count, differential and blood chemistry were within normal limits for both brothers and they were not malnourished. The phagocytosis and killing function of their polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) towards four bacterial species were assessed using a fluorochrome microassay. The selection of bacterial species was based on preliminary microbiological results in early onset periodontitis in Egypt. Fluorochrome-labeled Prevotella intermedia, Peptostreptococcus micros, Campylobacter rectus, and Porphyromonas gingivalis were pre-opsonized with ANUP serum and added to PMN from both ANUP patients, as well as PMN from three sex-matched and two sex- and age-matched healthy Egyptian control (CTL) subjects. We found significant depressions (P < 0.05) in PMN phagocytosis and killing of C. rectus and P. intermedia by ANUP1 and ANUP2, when compared to all CTL PMN. An assessment of the Gram-negative subgingival microflora present in both ANUP patients (in colony forming unit percent of total CFU recovered) (CFU %) revealed the presence of P. intermedia (ANUP1, 41.7 CFU %; ANUP2, 14.8 CFU %), Fusobacterium nucleatum (ANUP1, 3.6 CFU %; ANUP2, 48.1 CFU %), and Veillonella spp. (ANUP1, 18.2 CFU %; ANUP2, 18.5 CFU %). Spirochetes were also observed in cytocentrifuged, Gram-stained plaque from both ANUP patients. The predominant Gram-positive bacterial species recovered from both NUG1 and NUG2 was Streptococcus morbillorum.
TI  - Bacteria invading periapical cementum.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine whether microorganisms invade periapical cementum of human teeth from the adjacent periapical lesions. We therefore attempted to isolate microorganisms from periapical cementum through the adoption of standard anaerobic procedures for obligate anaerobes. Samples of cementum were taken from 10 amputated tooth roots at the time of apicoectomy. From two of these samples, bacteria were recovered after anaerobic incubation, but no bacteria were recovered after aerobic incubation of the same samples. Of a total of eight isolates from the cementum, seven were obligate anaerobes and one was aerotolerant. The obligate anaerobes isolated were assigned to the genera Prevotella, Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium, and Fusobacterium. The aerotolerant anaerobe was Campylobacter. From this, we conclude that bacteria can successfully invade cementum via periapical periodontal tissue, and that such bacteria may play a significant role in chronic periapical pathosis.
TI  - Piperacillin and tazobactam versus clindamycin and gentamicin in the treatment of hospitalized women with pelvic infection. The Piperacillin/tazobactam Study Group.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of a combination of piperacillin and tazobactam with that of clindamycin and gentamicin in the treatment of hospitalized women with infections of the upper genital tract. METHODS: This was a randomized open-label trial in hospitalized women with infections of the upper genital tract. Patients were recruited at 12 hospitals in the United States and two hospitals in Canada and were randomly assigned to one of two regimens in a 2:1 ratio. One group received piperacillin, 3 g every 6 hours, and tazobactam, 375 mg every 6 hours; the other group received clindamycin, 900 mg every 8 hours, and gentamicin, 2.5-5.0 mg/kg/day in three divided doses. Therapy with the assigned regimen was to be administered for a minimum of 3 days. Cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were obtained from the site of infection before initiation of therapy. Cultures for Chlamydia trachomatis were also obtained from patients with endometritis or pelvic inflammatory disease. Subjects were evaluated for clinical and bacteriologic response at 24-72 hours and 2-4 weeks after completing therapy. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-nine patients were enrolled; 196 were in the piperacillin-tazobactam group and 103 were in the clindamycin-gentamicin group. The most common diagnoses were endometritis (146) and pelvic inflammatory disease (115). The most common microorganisms recovered included: Peptostreptococcus sp (99), Prevotella sp (87), black pigmented Bacteroides (29), B fragilis (11), enterococci (64), group B streptococcus (26), Escherichia coli (31), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (49), and C trachomatis (19). A favorable clinical response occurred in 84.7% (166 of 196) of piperacillin-tazobactam patients and 87.3% (90 of 103) of clindamycin-gentamicin patients. Among those evaluable for bacteriologic response, 78% (67 of 86) and 82% (23 of 28), respectively, had a favorable response. Diarrhea occurred significantly more frequently in the piperacillin-tazobactam group (9.7 versus 2.9%; P = .04), but the majority of episodes were mild to moderate. None of the adverse experiences in either treatment group were considered life-threatening and drug-related. CONCLUSION: The combination of piperacillin and tazobactam is an effective and well-tolerated antibiotic regimen for the treatment of infections of the upper genital tract in women.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of cefteram against recently clinically detected and isolated strains from patients with dental infections].
AB  - To investigate the antibiotic activity of cefteram (CFTM), the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CFTM and of the control drugs were determined against clinically isolated strains received from November 1991 to April 1993 from 19 dental facilities throughout the country, as well as against clinically isolated strains from samples obtained at this center from patients with dental infectious diseases, and the following results were obtained. 1. 430 strains were detected in 198 cases but identified strains amounted to 425. They are comprised of 204 strains of oral streptococci (48.0%), 81 strains of Peptostreptococcus spp. (19.1%), 10 strains of Bacteroides spp. (2.4%), 23 strains of Prevotella spp. (5.4%), and 9 strains of Porphyromonas spp. (2.1%). The ratios of Gram-positive bacteria v.s. Gram-negative bacteria were 78.4% and 21.6%, respectively, and the Gram-positive bacteria were isolated at higher frequency than Gram-negative bacteria. 2. The MIC90's of CFTM against oral streptococci and Peptostreptococcus spp. were 0.10 microgram/ml and 0.05 microgram/ml, and year to year increases of incidences of resistance against CFTM were not observed. Some strains, however, appeared to have obtained resistance to CFTM. 3. Among Bacteroides spp., Prevotella spp., Porphyromonas spp. which used to belong to genus Bacteroides, there were some strains resistant to CFTM. As a whole, however, no year to year increases in the incidence of CFTM resistance among these strains also. 4. Two strains of 6 Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus were methicillin-resistant. 5. The above observations indicate that CFTM still shows strong antimicrobial activity against clinically isolated strains that may be involved in dental infections.
TI  - An unclassified Eubacterium taxon in acute dento-alveolar abscess.
AB  - The microflora of pus samples aspirated from 50 acute dento-alveolar abscesses was examined. A total of 143 bacterial strains was isolated, consisting predominantly of Prevotella spp., alpha-haemolytic Streptococcus spp., Peptostreptococcus spp. and Eubacterium spp. An unclassified asaccharolytic Eubacterium taxon was encountered in 17 (34%) of the abscesses. This taxon was found to have a positive association with Fusobacterium spp. and a negative association with alpha-haemolytic Streptococcus spp.
TI  - Bacterial colonization and degradation of demineralized dentin matrix in situ.
AB  - Lesion formation in dentin involves demineralization followed by degradation of the exposed organic matrix. Proteinases from microorganisms present in the dentin are believed to play an important role in the breakdown of the dentinal collagen. In this study, the microflora colonizing decalcified dentin matrix, placed in situ, was identified. The gelatinolytic activity of the isolated strains was assessed and related to the degradation of the dentin matrix. The predominant species found were Streptococcus mitis. Peptostreptococcus productus, Lactobacillus casei, Propionibacterium species and Veillonella parvula. Marked interindividual variation in the composition of the microflora was observed. The microflora possessed gelatinolytic activity, although no correlation was found with the severity of dentin matrix degradation. The chemically determined loss of collagen varied between 0 and 67 wt% per participant and corresponded with the extent of collagen degradation observed by transmission electron microscopy.
TI  - 16S ribosomal DNA sequences of anaerobic cocci and proposal of Ruminococcus hansenii comb. nov. and Ruminococcus productus comb. nov.
AB  - The 16S ribosomal DNA sequences of representative members of the family Peptococcaceae were determined. The members of the family examined were divided into the following four phylogenetic groups: Peptococcus niger ATCC 27731T (T = type strain), the Sarcina-Peptostreptococcus anaerobius group, the ruminococcus-coprococcus group, and the peptostreptococcus group. Peptococcus niger, the type species of the family, was not related to other members of the family. Peptostreptococcus anaerobius ATCC 27337T, the type strain of the type species of the genus Peptostreptococcus, was closely related to Clostridium sordellii NCIB 10717T (level of sequence similarity, 85%). Sarcina ventriculi GIFU 7886, a spore-forming anaerobic gram-positive coccus, clustered with Clostridium perfringens ATCC 13124T at a similarity value of 91%. Members of the Sarcina-Peptostreptococcus anaerobius group clustered with clostridia at similarity values ranging from 85 to 91%. The type strains of Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Peptostreptococcus magnus clustered at levels of sequence homology of 84 to 93%. This cluster was not included in the Peptococcus niger group or the Peptostreptococcus anaerobius group. Thus, these members of the genus Peptostreptococcus should be separated from the other members of the genus and also from members of the family Peptococcaceae. The sequence of Peptostreptococcus productus ATCC 27340T was different from the sequences of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Peptococcus niger. The sequence of Streptococcus hansenii ATCC 27752T, a strictly anaerobic strain, was different from the sequences of other streptococci; this strain clustered with Peptostreptococcus productus, coprococci, and ruminococci. Several phenotypic characteristics of Streptococcus hansenii ATCC 27752T were similar to characteristics of ruminococci.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - A quantitative comparison of selected bacteria in human carious dentine by microscopic counts.
AB  - The levels of selected cariogenic and obligately anaerobic bacteria have been compared in carious dentine taken from fissures, smooth surfaces, and root surfaces. The numbers of infected dentinal tubules were determined by immunohistological staining using species-specific antisera against selected bacteria. Selective localization was observed; mutans streptococci were the predominant bacteria in dentine from fissures and smooth surface coronal caries, but not from root surface caries. The proportion of mutans streptococci was higher in the shallow and middle layers of dentine from fissures and smooth surface coronal carious lesions than from the deep layers. In root surface caries, Actinomyces spp. were the predominant bacteria, and were present at higher levels in the deep layer of root lesions than in the shallow and middle layers. The proportion of Lactobacillus spp. was relatively low despite its high detection frequency in all layers of the three types of carious lesion. Immunohistological staining with species-specific antisera was able to reveal the distribution and the localization of various bacteria in carious dentine.
TI  - [What kinds of species are in the conjunctiva?].
AB  - With suitable culture methods less than 5% of conjunctival fluid specimens remain negative. From approximately 95% of the swab cultures at least 65 bacterial species - although in low numbers - were recovered. Among the predominant organisms were gram-positive species like several coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp., Propionibacterium spp., Corynebacterium spp. and members of the genera Peptostreptococcus, Streptococcus and Actinomyces. Among the frequently isolated gram-negative species were members of the genera Neisseria and Haemophilus as well as Enterobacteriaceae like Proteus spp.
TI  - Microbiology of the pericoronal pouch in mandibular third molar pericoronitis.
AB  - The microorganisms associated with mandibular third molar pericoronitis were investigated using direct microscopy and anaerobic culture method. The pericoronal pouch was sampled with paper points in A) 8 patients without mandibular third molar pericoronitis and B) 6 patients with mandibular third molar pericoronitis. Under the microscope, the microflora was found to be a complex mixture comprising gram-positive and gram-negative cocci, rods and filaments (including fusiform and curved rods), motile rods and spirochetes. Significantly higher proportions of motile, gram-negative rods were found in group B than in group A. The predominant cultivable microflora of 9 samples: A (4) and B (5) comprised several species of facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria, namely Peptostreptococcus, Streptococcus, Actinomyces, Eubacterium, Propionibacterium, Veillonella, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, Bacteriodes, Fusobacterium, Campylobacter, Staphylococcus, Stomatococcus, Lactobacillus, Neisseria, Capnocytophaga, Haemophilus, Selenomonas and Centipeda species. The microflora in pericoronitis appeared similar to that of diseased periodontal pockets.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DV-7751a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - We compared the in vitro antibacterial activity of DV-7751a against gram-positive and -negative bacteria with those of quinolones currently available. MICs for 90% of the strains tested (MIC90s) against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.20, 0.39, 0.20, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. Moreover, MIC50s for DV-7751a against ofloxacin-resistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-fold lower than those for tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. DV-7751a inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Peptostreptococcus spp. at 0.39, 0.39, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively, and was 4- to > 16-fold more active against enterococci at the MIC90 level than the other quinolones tested. The activity of DV-7751a against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin at the MIC90 level and was two- to fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin. DV-7751a showed activity comparable to those of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against the other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90s of 0.025, 0.20, and 0.10 micrograms/ml, respectively). DV-7751a activity was not affected by medium, inoculum size, or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions and in human urine, as were the other quinolones tested. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated the rapid bactericidal action of DV-7751a against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and P. aeruginosa. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to DV-7751a was less than or equal to those of the reference drugs. DV-7751a inhibited the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrases from S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa at concentrations comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin.
TI  - Management of maxillofacial infections: a review of 50 cases.
AB  - Maxillofacial infections often place the oral and maxillofacial surgeon in situations where timely decisions have to be made. These decisions can be life-saving. This study reviews 50 infections treated over a 3-year period. The results reveal rapid resolution of the infections by adhering to fundamental principles in their management: recognition of airway compromise, surgical intervention, and the administration of the appropriate antibiotic. A protocol for the management of maxillofacial infections is described.
TI  - Bacteriologic findings in peritonsillar abscesses in young adults.
AB  - Aspirated pus samples from 124 patients with peritonsillar abscess were cultured  quantitatively for aerobes and anaerobes. A total of 98% of the samples yielded bacteria. Of the 550 isolates obtained (mean, 4.4 per patient), 143 were aerobes (representing 16 species or groups) and 407 were anaerobes (representing 40 species or groups). Aerobes were isolated from 86% of patients-alone in 20 cases and together with anaerobes in 87. The most common aerobic isolates were Streptococcus pyogenes (isolated from 45% of patients), Streptococcus milleri group organisms (27%), Haemophilus influenzae (11%), and viridans streptococci (11%). Anaerobes were isolated from 82% of the samples and as a sole finding from 15 abscesses. Fusobacterium necrophorum and Prevotella melaninogenica were both isolated from 38% of patients, Prevotella intermedia from 32%, Peptostreptococcus micros from 27%, Fusobacterium nucleatum from 26%, and Actinomyces odontolyticus from 23%. The rate of previous tonsillar/peritonsillar infections was lowest (25%) among patients infected with S. pyogenes and highest (52%) among those infected with F. necrophorum (P < .01). Recurrences and/or related tonsillectomies were more common among patients infected with F. necrophorum than among those infected with S. pyogenes (57% vs. 19%; P < .0001) or with S. milleri group organisms (43% vs. 19%; P < .05). beta-Lactamase was produced by only 38% of the 73 isolates of Prevotella species tested; however, 56% of the 36 patients studied harbored one or more such strains.
TI  - Recent taxonomic changes for anaerobic gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms.
AB  - The strains formerly classified as Streptococcus anginosus or "Streptococcus milleri" have now been recognized as three distinct species, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus intermedius. Streptococcus morbillorum has been transferred into the genus Gemella. Four new species within the genus Peptostreptococcus were recently named. A recent addition to the genus Clostridium is Clostridium argentinense, which includes Clostridium botulinum type G. Two new species of Actinomyces have been introduced: Actinomyces georgiae and Actinomyces gerencseriae. Arachnia propionica was shown to be related to propionibacteria and has been renamed Propionibacterium propionicum. Eubacterium yurii was named to contain "test-tube brush" bacteria found in subgingival plaque. Lactobacillus uli and Lactobacillus rimae are obligately anaerobic lactobacilli found in periodontal pockets. Bilophila is a new genus of gram-negative bacilli. Wolinella recta and Wolinella curva are now included in the genus Campylobacter. The taxonomic position of Mobiluncus, currently assigned to the family Bacteroidaceae, remains uncertain.
TI  - An in-vitro study of the comparative viability on different swab types of simulated specimens of bacteria commonly present in oro-facial infections.
AB  - An in-vitro study was undertaken to investigate the survival on bacteriological swabs of three potentially pathogenic organisms found in oro-facial infections, by using simulated clinical specimens incubated in the presence or absence of Amies transport medium. Standard inocula of pure cultures of Streptococcus milleri, Prevotella melaninogenica and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were soaked on to swabs and plated out on to solid media at various intervals up to 3 days, enabling an estimate of their viability to be made following further incubation. Differential survival of the three test organisms was observed, with Streptococcus milleri being generally the hardiest and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius the least hardy, whilst survival was consistently enhanced by the presence of a transport medium. Recovery of Prevotella melaninogenica was improved by incubation for 5 days. We conclude that transport swabs should be used in preference to plain swabs whenever immediate laboratory culture cannot be assured, to avoid loss of anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - [Bacteriological and clinical studies in 23 cases of thoracic empyema--the role of oral streptococci and anaerobes].
AB  - The bacteriology of empyema fluid and the clinical background of 23 cases from July 1987 through July 1992 were studied. Nineteen cases were male and 4 female, with a mean age of 59.6 years (range; 33 to 84 y.o.). There were 15 cases of community-acquired infection and 8 of nosocomial infection. Acute pneumonia and/or lung abscess developed into empyema in 19 cases. Sixteen cases had associated predisposing conditions, such as diabetes, chronic bronchitis, disorders with dysphagia, and excess alcohol intake. Forty-one strains were isolated from empyema in 22 cases. The predominant organisms, in order of prevalence, were "Streptococcus milleri" group (11 strains), Peptostreptococcus spp. (6), Prevotella spp. (6), Fusobacterium spp. (5) and other viridans streptococci (3). The majority of streptococcal infections, which were primarily caused by "S. milleri" group, were mixed with anaerobes and/or aerobes/facultatives. These results demonstrate that oral streptococci, especially "S. milleri" group, and anaerobes play a significant role as pathogens in empyema.
TI  - Lung abscess: analysis of 66 cases from 1979 to 1991.
AB  - Sixty-six patients with bacterial lung abscess were treated between 1979 and 1991 in our hospital. Among these patients, death occurred in one of the 42 cases of community-acquired infection (mortality rate: 2.4%) and in 16 of the 24 cases of nosocomial infection (mortality rate: 66.7%). Of all 66 cases, 55 were culture-positive, and the etiologic agents isolated from 24 of the culture-positive cases were found to be anaerobic bacteria. The most common aerobes isolated from the foci were identified as Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while the most common anaerobes were Bacteroides spp., Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium spp., microaerophilic Streptococcus and Veillonella. The mortality was higher in the cases with P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp. and Candida spp. than in those with other bacteria. The prognosis of lung abscess patients proved to depend on the presence of underlying diseases and on superinfection with aerobes.
TI  - Black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes in endodontic infections.
AB  - Necrotic dental root canal infections are polymicrobial infections dominated by anaerobic bacteria. The number of different species in one canal is usually low, approx. 4-7 species. The species isolated most frequently belong to the genera Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium and Streptococcus. The frequency of isolation of black-pigmented Gram-negative anaerobes in endodontic infections varies from 25% to > 50%. Pr. intermedia is the most commonly found pigmented species, followed by Pr. denticola and two Porphyromonas species, P. gingivalis and P. endodontalis. Several studies have shown that P. gingivalis and P. endodontalis are closely related to the presence of acute symptoms in endodontic infections, whereas other black-pigmented Gram-negative anaerobes are not. However, several other species may also be involved in acute infections. Moreover, Porphyromonas species have occasionally been isolated from cases with no symptoms. Although Porphyromonas spp. are clearly related to symptoms at the beginning of therapy, they are not important for the prognosis of the treatment.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of T-3761, a new quinolone derivative.
AB  - T-3761, a new quinolone derivative, showed broad and potent antibacterial activity. Its MICs for 90% of the strains tested were 0.20 to 100 micrograms/ml against gram-positive bacteria, including members of the genera Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus; 0.025 to 3.13 micrograms/ml against gram-negative bacteria, including members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and the genus Haemophilus; 0.05 to 50 micrograms/ml against glucose nonfermenters, including members of the genera Pseudomonas, Xanthomonas, Acinetobacter, Alcaligenes, and Moraxella; 0.025 micrograms/ml against Legionella spp.; and 6.25 to 25 micrograms/ml against anaerobes, including Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium difficile, and Peptostreptococcus spp. The in vitro activity of T-3761 against these clinical isolates was comparable to or 2- to 32-fold greater than those of ofloxacin and norfloxacin and 2- to 16-fold less and 1- to 8-fold greater than those of ciprofloxacin and tosulfoxacin, respectively. When administered orally, T-3761 showed good efficacy in mice against systemic, pulmonary, and urinary tract infections with gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including quinolone-resistant Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The in vivo activity of T-3761 was comparable to or greater than those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and tosufloxacin against most infection models in mice. The activities of T-3761 were lower than those of tosufloxacin against gram-positive bacterial systemic and pulmonary infections in mice but not against infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The activities of T-3761 against systemic quinolone-resistant Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in mice were 2- to 14-fold greater than those of the reference agents.
TI  - A review of commonly prescribed oral antibiotics in general dentistry.
AB  - The microflora associated with odontogenic infections are typically mixed and of  indigenous origin. Streptococcus, peptostreptococcus, peptococcus, fusobacterium, bacteroides, and actinomyces species are the principle microflora isolated from these infections. Penicillin V (phenoxymethyl penicillin) remains the antimicrobial of choice for the initial empirical treatment of odontogenic infections. This agent is safe, highly effective and inexpensive. Amoxicillin has little indication for the routine treatment of odontogenic infections. However, it is the agent of choice for endocarditis prophylaxis, as it produces higher serum levels than penicillin V. Erythromycin may be used for mild, acute odontogenic infections in penicillin-allergic patients. The high incidence of gastrointestinal disturbances and superinfection commonly associated with the ingestion of tetracycline limits its role in general dental practice. Tetracycline may be considered as an alternative therapy for penicillin-allergic patients over the age of 13 who cannot tolerate erythromycin. Clindamycin is very effective against all odontogenic pathogens, but its potential gastrointestinal toxicity relegates it to third- or even fourth-line therapy in general dentistry. Although metronidazole displays excellent activity against anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, it is only moderately effective against facultative and anaerobic gram-positive cocci, and should not be used alone in the treatment of acute odontogenic infections.
TI  - Contemporary management of deep infections of the neck.
AB  - Odontogenic infections rarely lead to involvement of the lateral and retropharyngeal spaces. When this does occur, the microbiology of the infection is similar to the typical odontogenic infection, ie, Streptococcus and oral anaerobes including Peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides, and Fusobacterium. There is an increased incidence of Fusobacterium seen in the more severe infections, as well as a higher incidence of Streptococcus milleri. Many patients who have deep cervical infections also have some compromise in their host defense mechanism, such as diabetes. The signs and symptoms of deep cervical space infections are similar to those of the severe submandibular space infection, but also includes sialorrhea, respiratory distress, odynophagia, and dysphagia. Lateral soft-tissue radiographs of the neck are useful in assisting with the diagnosis of retropharyngeal infections, and CT scans can provide definitive information regarding lateral pharyngeal space involvement. Treatment includes the use of high-dose intravenous bacteriocidal antibiotics. The recommended antibiotics are penicillin-metronidazole, ampicillin-sulbactam, or clindamycin. Certain cephalosporins may also be useful in selected patients. Early surgical intervention is also indicated. Aggressive incision and drainage of all of the involved spaces is necessary to assure early resolution of the infection. Continual airway monitoring and the establishment of surgical airways is the final portion of the treatment triad.
TI  - Sub-gingival microflora in Macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey.
AB  - The Macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey is one of several non-human primate (nhp) models for periodontal disease. This report presents the bacteriology of the gingival sulci in M. mulatta monkeys. Three sub-gingival sites (maxillary right central incisor, the disto-buccal of the mandibular left second molar and mesio-buccal of the mandibular right second molar) of 9 monkeys were evaluated clinically before scaling and 7 days after scaling. Plaque samples were obtained from sub-gingival sites before clinical examination and studied bacteriologically by dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and by primary phenotypic characterizations of culture isolates. Several gingival sites presented with mild gingival inflammation. Anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria were the predominant flora colonizing the gingival sulci. The major microbial groups were Haemophilus species (100% of sites; percentage of total anaerobic count (TAC): 21-51), Peptostreptococcus micros (89%, 7.5-29.5), Actinomyces sp. (85%, 7-27), Fusobacterium nucleatum (90%, 5-8), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (73%, 1.3-12), black-pigmented anaerobic rods (BPAR) (80%, 0.6-6.5) and oral streptococci (80%, 0.2-1.0). Microbial groups detected less often were Wolinella sp. (66%, 0-2.6), Capnocytophaga sp. (30%), Eikenella corrodens (4.7%, 0), Campylobacter sp. (28%, 0-0.1) and spirochetes (4.7%, 0-0.07). Seven days after gingival sites were scaled, the plaque score and indices for gingival inflammation declined significantly. The gingival flora after scaling were characterized by lower proportions of the Actinomyces sp., P. micros and BPAR; and increased proportions of the oral streptococci, relative to pre-scaling levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [The role anaerobes in dermatitis digitalis et interdigitalis in cattle].
AB  - Altogether 52 tissue samples and swabs from the corium of the claw of diseased cattle were investigated. Microbiological examinations revealed the presence of 11 strictly anaerobic bacterial strains that belonged to the species Peptococcus asacharolyticus, Pc. sacharolyticus, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides asacharolyticus and B. melaninogenicus. The remaining isolates were classified as Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Streptococcus and Clostridium. In the above-mentioned strains observations of their biochemical, morphological and enzymatic properties (Tab. I) were carried out. Their resistance to antibiotics was evaluated from the qualitative viewpoint (Tab. II). Capillary isotachophoresis was used to determine the amounts of volatile fatty acids that developed during glucose fermentation (Tab. III). In the single clinical samples the above-mentioned strains occurred as association of microorganism. The anaerobic genera Bacteroides and Fusobacterium were found in 52% of the samples (Bacteroides sp. and Fusobacterium sp. were recorded in 25% and 12% of the samples, respectively, whereas in 15% of the samples both species occurred). According to our results the etiology of dermatitis digitalis et interdigitalis is closely connected with the incidence of anaerobes. Of the latter, those belonging to the genera Bacteroides and Fusobacterium are of major importance.

TI  - Protein LG: a hybrid molecule with unique immunoglobulin binding properties.
AB  - Immunoglobulin (Ig)-binding bacterial proteins have attracted theoretical interest for their role in molecular host-parasite interactions, and they are widely used as tools in immunology, biochemistry, medicine, and biotechnology. Protein L of the anaerobic bacterial species Peptostreptococcus magnus binds Ig light chains, whereas streptococcal protein G has affinity for the constant (Fc) region of IgG. In this report, Ig binding parts of protein L and protein G were combined to form a hybrid molecule, protein LG, which was found to bind a large majority of intact human Igs as well as Fc and Fab fragments, and Ig light chains. Binding to Ig was specific, and the affinity constants of the reactions between protein LG and human IgG, IgGFc fragments, and kappa light chains, determined by Scatchard plots, were 5.9 x 10(9), 2.2 x 10(9), and 2.0 x 10(9) M-1, respectively. The binding properties of protein LG were more complete as compared with previously described Ig-binding proteins when also tested against mouse and rat Igs. This hybrid protein thus represents a powerful tool for the binding, detection, and purification of antibodies and antibody fragments.
TI  - Physico-chemical and structural properties of the surfaces of Peptostreptococcus  micros and Streptococcus mitis as compared to those of mutans streptococci, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus salivarius.
AB  - The surface properties of nine Streptococcus mitis and four Peptostreptococcus micros strains from the oral cavity were examined and compared with a large group of oral streptococci. Zeta potential and contact angle measurements were employed to determine physico-chemical cell surface properties. In addition, elemental surface concentration ratios were obtained via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and surface structures were examined with transmission electron microscopy. The S. mitis and P. micros strains were found to have higher isoelectric points, higher hydrophobicities and higher N/C surface concentration ratios than some other oral streptococci. The combined data suggest that both species possess large amounts of surface protein. All the S. mitis strains displayed abundant surface fibrils in negative staining, but the P. micros strains were devoid of surface appendages indicating that surface protein is present in different forms in the two species. The surfaces of S. mitis and P. micros type strains differed significantly from the other strains examined.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of root canal medicaments.
AB  - The antibacterial efficacy of four endodontic medicaments was studied in vitro. Calcium hydroxide (CALACEPT), camphorated parachlorophenol (CPCP), Cresophene, and 2% iodine-potassium iodide (IKI) were tested against four anaerobic microorganisms, Streptococcus mutans, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Porphyromonus gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum, for 10 or 15 min. IKI was effective only against F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis, and the others were effective against all four microorganisms.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of rokitamycin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - We obtained bacterial strains which were clinically isolated and identified from  outpatients with various infections in medical institutions throughout Japan. Possible antibacterial activities of rokitamycin (RKM) were examined against these isolates. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined through a comparative study with reference drugs. The results of the study are summarized as follows. 1. Resistance patterns of 400 isolates which were highly resistant to macrolides (MLs) with MIC values > 100 micrograms/ml were classified into 55 patterns. Staphylococcus spp. showed cross resistance to 14-membered ring MLs with 100% cross resistance observed between erythromycin (EM) and clarithromycin (CAM), and 85.2% between EM and oleandomycin (OL). Fewer isolates showed strong resistance to 16-membered ring MLs than to 14-membered ring MLs. Cross resistances observed among the Staphylococcus isolates were 100% between acetylmidecamycin (MDM-AC) and kitasamycin (leucomycin (LM)), 93.9% between MDM-AC and josamycin (JM), and 53.3% between MDM-AC and RKM. Streptococcus spp. and Peptococcus spp. showed very similar resistance patterns to both 14- and 16-membered ring MLs, but resistance patterns to RKM were quite different. Most of anaerobic streptococci and Bacteroides fragilis group had similar resistance patterns to 14- and 16-membered ring MLs, but in some cases a pattern similar to that of Staphylococcus spp. was observed. 2. When ML-resistant bacteria isolated during 1975 to 1980 were compared to those isolated in 1986 and 1989, it was observed that resistance of Staphylococcus aureus remained almost unchanged, that of Streptococcus pyogenes was lower in the later years than during 1975 to 1980, but that of Streptococcus pneumoniae increased. 3. Most of ML-resistances of the resistant isolates were inducible, but extents of induction varied depending on drugs tested. Strong inductions were observed when 14-membered ring MLs were used, but inductions were minimal with 16-membered ring MLs. RKM appeared to induce resistance to the least extent. From these results, it appears that the RKM is quite useful clinically even in the 1990s.
TI  - Associations between microbial species in dental root canal infections.
AB  - The existence of commensal or antagonistic relationships between microorganisms in the root canals of teeth with apical periodontitis was investigated. Samples were taken from 65 infected human root canals and were analysed according to species, frequency of occurrence and proportion of the total isolated flora. The most frequent species were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Peptostreptococcus micros, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Eubacterium alactolyticum, Eubacterium lentum and Wolinella recta. An odds ratio system was used to calculate positive or negative associations between the isolated bacteria. Strong positive associations were found between F. nucleatum and P. micros, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Selenomonas sputigena and W. recta. There was also a positive association between P. intermedia and P. micros, P. anaerobius and the eubacteria. In general, species of streptococci, Propionibacterium propionica, Capnocytophaga ochracea and Veillonella parvula showed no or negative associations with the other bacteria. The results are consistent with the concept of a special and selective environment occurring in the root canal that is due, in part, to the cooperative as well as antagonistic nature of the relationships between bacteria in the root canal.
TI  - Microbiology of secondarily infected diaper dermatitis.
AB  - Specimens obtained from 67 infants with secondarily infected diaper dermatitis were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Bacteria growth was obtained in 58. Aerobic facultative bacteria or Candida sp. only were present in 28 patients (48%), anaerobic bacteria only in 11 (19%), and mixed anaerobic with aerobic, facultative, or yeast flora was present in 19 (33%). Ninety-one bacterial or fungal isolates were recovered (1.6 per specimen), 54 (0.9 per specimen) aerobic or facultative bacteria, 8 (0.1 per specimen) Candida sp., and 31 (0.6 per specimen) strict anaerobes. The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (23 isolates), Streptococcus sp. (16), and Escherichia coli (6). The predominant anaerobes included Bacteroides sp. (12, including 9 Bacteroides fragilis group) and Peptostreptococcus sp. (11). Single bacterial isolates were recovered in 32 (55%) patients, 18 of which were S. aureus. Twenty-five beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were detected in 22 (51%) of the 43 tested patients. These included 16 S. aureus and 6 B. fragilis group. These data highlight the importance of anaerobic bacteria in the polymicrobial nature of secondarily infected diaper dermatitis.
TI  - [Bacteriology of infectious disease in otorhinolaryngology (1). Bacteriological study of paranasal cyst].
AB  - The bacteriology of chronic sinusitis has been reported in several studies, but there have been few bacteriological studies on paranasal cyst. Also, details of the techniques of transportation and processing of clinical specimens have only rarely been described. Therefore, this study was undertaken with attention to the above, and to obtain information on appropriate antimicrobial therapy, we conducted a dilution antimicrobial susceptibility test of isolates. Fifteen patients with paranasal cyst participated in this study. Their lesions were frontal sinus (3), ethmoid sinus (2), sphenoid sinus (2) and maxillary sinus (8). We punctured the cyst using an 18-gauge needle attached to a syringe at the time of operation, and paranasal cyst effusions were promptly transported to the laboratory. The specimen was immediately inoculated under a set of aerobic and prereduced anaerobic plates, which were incubated in appropriate conditions. Most specimens were completely processed within one hour. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of isolates was done with MIC panel by the Sceptor system. Positive results of bacterial cultures were found in 60% of all cases (all of the frontal sinus specimens and half of those with other lesions). A total of 38 bacteria, including 24 anaerobic and 14 aerobic species, were isolated from 9 paranasal cysts, yielding an average of 4.2 species per positive case (2.9 anaerobes and 1.3 aerobes). Monomicrobial flora were found, anaerobes only in 2 cases and aerobes only in 2 others. Mixed flora were found in 5 cases in which both anaerobes and aerobes were isolated. The bacterial concentration in the maximal case was 4.9 x 10(4) CFU/ml. The organisms most frequently isolated were Propionibacterium spp. (7), Peptostreptococcus spp. (7), Staphylococcus spp. (7), Prevotella spp. (5) and Streptococcus spp. (4). On the basis of the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing of isolates in vitro, the use of Cephems, Clavulanic acid/Amoxicillin, Norfloxacin and Chloramphenicol proved to be clinically effective.
TI  - Impact of the advances in age on the gastrointestinal microflora of beagle dogs.
AB  - The gastrointestinal microflora of male beagle dogs in two different age groups;  I) less than month 12 of age, and II) more than year 11 of age, was compared. No detectable difference occurred on the microflora of stomach, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum in both dogs. Large bowel (cecum, colon and rectum) microflora in both dogs yielded the different microbial populations. In all regions of large bowel, the levels of bacteroides, eubacteria, peptostreptococci, bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, and staphylococci in the elderly dogs were lower than those in the younger animals, whereas the numbers of Clostridium perfringens and streptococci in the elderly animals were higher than those in the youngers. The high incidence of lecithinase-negative clostridia was observed with advances in age, but not that of spiral shaped rods. The result of this study shows that the advances in age of beagle dogs yield some changes in the microbial population of large bowel in the animals.
TI  - Immunoglobulins in milk from cows immunized with oral strains of Actinomyces, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, and Fusobacterium.
AB  - Immunization of pregnant cows with bacteria leads to the presence of high concentrations of specific antibodies in colostrum and milk. A total of 14 cows was immunized with single strains of heat-killed oral bacteria or pools of strains of Actinomyces, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, and Fusobacterium. Two cows were treated with adjuvant alone. The mean percentages of IgG1, IgG2, IgM, and IgA in all of the milks were 83.8, 3.8, 9.3, and 3.1, respectively. ELISA and whole cell agglutination assays demonstrated high titers in the milks from the cows immunized with either individual strains or the bacterial pools. The highest titers determined by ELISA belonged to the IgG1 isotype and in several milks were 64-fold greater than titers in milk from cows treated with adjuvant alone. The concentrations of all antibodies and the titers determined by ELISA and whole cell agglutination assays markedly decreased from the first to the sixth milkings. The functional specificity of the antibodies was demonstrated by agglutination tests against a wide range of bacteria including members of Actinomyces, Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, Streptococcus, Eubacterium, Propionibacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides, Actinobacillus, Haemophilus, Capnocytophaga, and Wolinella. Minimal cross-reactions with bacteria in other genera were observed with all of the milks. High-titer milk preparations have been obtained from immunized cows, and the capacity of the bovine antibodies to agglutinate target bacteria indicates their potential usefulness in oral passive immunization studies.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of ceftriaxone against clinically isolated strains].
AB  - Antibiotic activities (MICs) of ceftriaxone (CTRX) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of other cephems. 1. When compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated MIC90s of CTRX: Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Providencia spp. No changes were observed in MIC90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. 2. The MIC90 of CTRX to S. pneumoniae was high because a large number of benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP) was present among this species. The MIC80 to Bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant B. fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. Other oxime-type cephems also had high MICs against the above mentioned bacteria. Therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as CTRX against PISP and B. fragilis group. 3. Sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), cephamycin-resistant as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. Some of there resistant bacteria are also CTRX-resistant, and CTRX had insufficient activities against them. 4. With regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with CTRX-resistance from year to year, the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989 and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "Subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. It appears that those strains resistant to cephems including CTRX are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. CTRX, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. Furthermore, considering that CTRX is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that CTRX is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.
TI  - Anaerobic microflora associated with the pars oesophagea of the pig.
AB  - In healthy pigs aged one to 35 days significant populations of microorganisms (5.5 to 6.9 log10 viable count cm-2 of the tissue) were found, by strict anaerobic techniques, to adhere to the pars oesophagea. The genera of anaerobes which were isolated included Actinomyces, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Lactobacillus, Peptostreptococcus, Streptococcus and Veillonella and facultative anaerobes included Escherichia, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and yeasts. The microbial population adhering to the pars oesophagea varied little from birth till after weaning and Lactobacillus, Clostridium and Eubacterium predominated. There were generally small numbers of facultatively anaerobic microorganisms in the pars oesophagea of healthy sucking or weaned pigs but large numbers of anaerobes, particularly Lactobacillus. In the pars oesophagea of sucking and weaned pigs with diarrhoea, large numbers of facultative anaerobes were frequent but Lactobacillus were also present in large numbers.
TI  - Comparative bacteriological studies on summer mastitis in grazing cattle and pyogenes mastitis in stabled cattle in Denmark.
AB  - A total of 143 secretions from clinical cases of summer mastitis (SM) in grazing  cattle and from 89 cases of pyogenes mastitis (PM) in stabled cattle were examined bacteriologically. The typical bacteriological finding was a mixed flora in which the predominant organisms were Actinomyces pyogenes (SM-70%, PM-85%), Peptostreptococcus indolicus (54%, 54%), a microaerophilic coccus (Stuart-Schwan coccus) (26%, 25%), Fusobacterium necrophorum biovar B (22%, 12%), Bacteroides melaninogenicus (20%, 9%) and Streptococcus dysgalactiae (21%, 5%). All except six cases occurred in non-lactating animals or within three weeks after parturition. The majority of animals (about 90%) had only one quarter affected and no differences in quarter distribution were observed between the two groups.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of azithromycin, macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin and spiramycin) and streptogramin RP 59500 against oral organisms.
AB  - The in-vitro activities of azithromycin, clarithromycin, spiramycin and RP 59500  were compared with erythromycin against a wide range of oral organisms which have been implicated in oral infections and/or endocarditis (clindamycin was included for oral streptococci). All compounds tested showed good activity against many of these organisms, although some variation was observed with different species. Clarithromycin was the most active of the antibiotics tested against Gram-positive anaerobes, including Actinomyces spp., Propionibacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium dentium. Azithromycin was slightly less active than erythromycin against these species. In general, RP 59500 had higher MICs than the macrolides, other than spiramycin, against these organisms, but was superior in activity against Peptostreptococcus spp., inhibiting all isolates at 2 mg/L. Azithromycin was, in general, the most active antibiotic tested against the Gram-negative anaerobes: Fusobacterium spp., Bacteroides spp., Wolinella spp., Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Selenomonas spp. and Mitsuokella multiacida, including those isolates which were insusceptible to erythromycin. Clarithromycin showed similar activity to erythromycin against most Gram-negative species, but was superior against Capnocytophaga ochraceus and Eikenella corrodens. RP 59500 was less active than the macrolides against most Gram-negative anaerobes, but was superior to erythromycin and clarithromycin against Fusobacterium spp. and Leptotrichia buccalis, some strains of which were moderately resistant to erythromycin. The macrolides and clindamycin were about equally active against the oral streptococci, whereas RP 59500 showed lower inhibitory activity. The in-vitro results suggest that azithromycin and clarithromycin may be of value in the treatment of dental sepsis and the prophylaxis of endocarditis. RP 59500 showed useful activity against Gram-positive anaerobes and, because of its bactericidal activity against oral streptococci, may also prove to have a role in these areas.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DU-6859, a new potent fluoroquinolone, against clinical isolates.
AB  - DU-6859, (-)-7-[(7S)-amino-5-azaspiro(2,4)heptan-5-yl]-8-chloro-6- fluoro-1-[(1R,2R)-cis-2-fluoro-1-cyclopropyl]-1,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinol one-3- carboxylic acid, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity which is significantly better than those of currently available quinolones. The MICs for 90% of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis clinical isolates (MIC90s) were 0.1, 3.13, 0.1, and 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. MIC50s of DU-6859 against quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 8-, 32-, 64-, and 128-fold lower than those of tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. DU-6859 inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes at 0.1 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively, and was more active against enterococci than the other quinolones tested. Although the activity of DU-6859 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to that of ciprofloxacin at the MIC50 level, it was fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin at the MIC90 level. DU-6859 was also more active against other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, than the other drugs tested. Strains of Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. were susceptible to DU-6859; MIC90s were 0.39 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively. DU-6859 generally showed activities twofold or greater than those of ciprofloxacin and the other drugs against almost all members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. The action of DU-6859 against the clinical isolates was bactericidal at concentrations near the MICs. DU-6859 activity was not affected by different media, pH, inoculum size, or human serum but was decreased in human urine.
TI  - Subgingival temperature (III). Relation to microbial counts.
AB  - The present investigation examined the relationship of selected bacterial species and subgingival temperature. 35 subjects were measured at 6 sites per tooth for clinical parameters and subgingival temperature. Measurements were repeated for 21 subjects at 2 month intervals providing a total of 66 subjects visits. At each visit, subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and anaerobically dispersed, diluted and plated on non-selective media. After anaerobic incubation, colonies were lifted to nylon filters and specific species detected using digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal DNA probes. Species enumerated were; A. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes a and b, B. forsythus, B. gingivalis, B. intermedius I and II, C. ochracea, F. nucleatum ss. vincentii, P. micros, S. intermedius, S. sanguis I and II, V. parvula and W. recta. Total viable counts and counts of Capnocytophaga sp. were determined directly from the primary isolation plates. A total of 1581 samples were evaluated. Subject visits with higher mean subgingival temperatures had significantly higher mean %s of B. intermedius I and P. micros, and lower mean %s of Capnocytophaga sp. Sites with higher subgingival temperatures had elevated proportions of B. intermedius I and II, A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a and B. gingivalis more frequently than sites with lower temperatures, while Capnocytophaga sp. were elevated more often at cooler sites. 43 of the subject visits had follow up attachment level measurements at 2 months. The 1026 microbial samples and the subgingival temperature measurements from these visits were related to longitudinal attachment change.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Microbiologic and pathologic aspects of pulpal and periapical disease.
AB  - The greatest cause of endodontic and periapical pathosis is microbial infection of the pulp. Most odontogenic infections are of a polymicrobial nature. With advances in anaerobic isolation and culturing techniques, much has been learned about the presence of pathogenic organisms such as Porphyromonas and Prevotella species (formerly classified as black-pigmented Bacteroides species) in infected root canals. This review provides a summary of recent developments in endodontic microbiology, virulence factors, and host defense systems as they relate to the pathogenesis of pulpal and periapical inflammatory lesions.
TI  - Spontaneous gas-forming bacterial myonecrosis caused by group B streptococci and  peptostreptococci.
AB  - We present the case of a patient who spontaneously developed a severe gas-forming infection involving the voluntary muscles of both thighs. The organisms responsible were group B beta-haemolytic streptococci together with peptostreptococci. Following surgical and medical treatment, the patient fully recovered. No predisposing factors, in particular no disease causing immunocompromise, could be identified.
TI  - Diagnosis and management of parotitis.
AB  - Of all the salivary glands, the parotid gland is most commonly affected by an inflammatory process. Infections of the parotid gland range from acute to severe. Assessment of the disease process should differentiate local primary parotid infection from systemic infection when this gland is also involved as part of a generalized inflammatory condition. Viral parotitis can be caused by paramyxovirus (mumps), Epstein-Barr virus, coxsackievirus, and influenza A and parainfluenza viruses. Acute suppurative parotitis is generally caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species, and rarely, gram-negative bacteria. Anaerobic bacteria, mostly Peptostreptococcus species and Bacteroides species, and pigmented Porphyromonas species and Prevotella species have been recently recognized as an important cause of this infection. beta-Lactamase-producing organisms can be isolated in almost three fourths of the patients. Predisposing factors to suppurative infections are dehydration, malnutrition, oral neoplasms, immunosuppuration, sialolithiasis, and medications that diminish salivation. Pus, aspirated from a suppurative parotic abscess, should be plated on media that are supportive for the growth of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi. Early and proper antimicrobial therapy may prevent suppuration. Initial empiric therapy that is directed against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria may be required until a specific causal diagnosis is available. Surgical drainage may be indicated when pus has formed. This may prevent complications and facilitate recovery.
TI  - Modulation of human neutrophil adherence by oral bacteria.
AB  - Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) comprise over 90 per cent of leukocytes in the oral cavity. Although these phagocytic cells have primary defence roles in the gingiva, their stimulation by micro-organisms may also cause substantial tissue damage due to the release of lysosomal enzymes and oxygen radicals. Adherence of PMNs to the endothelium and their subsequent diapedesis and egress to areas of infection are considered early vital events in the inflammatory process. In this study, oral bacteria were screened to determine their direct effects on PMN activation using an in vitro method of measuring PMN adherence to Dacron fibres. Most of the bacteria investigated increased PMN adherence, indicating their potential to cause tissue damage through the release of PMN lysosomal enzymes and other products. In contrast, Bacteroides species suppressed PMNs, indicating their ability to circumvent the phagocytic cells, thus gaining a potential advantage in dental colonization. The modulatory effects of oral bacteria on PMN activation may have significant roles in the immunopathogenesis of oral disease.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies on panipenem/betamipron in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies were performed on panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) in children. The results are summarized as follow: 1. Twelve patients with various bacterial infectious diseases were treated with PAPM/BP. Each dose was 20 mg/20 mg/kg, administered 3 times daily, in 30-minute intravenous drip infusion. Treatments were continued for 5-22 days. Clinical efficacies of PAPM/BP in 12 patients with bacterial infections (1 with suspected sepsis, 5 with pneumonia, 1 with acute maxillary sinusitis, 2 with acute otitis media, 1 with cervical abscess and 2 with urinary tract infection complexed type) were evaluated as excellent in 7, good in 4 and fair in 1, with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. Seventeen causative organisms found in 10 patients (Haemophilus influenzae in 4, Branhamella catarrhalis in 3, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2, Staphylococcus aureus in 1, alpha-Streptococcus in 1, Corynebacterium sp. in 1, Peptostreptococcus micros in 1 and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2) were eradicated except 2 strains (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa) from 1 patient (patient No. 2). No adverse reactions were observed in any of the 12 patients. 2. MICs of PAPM were examined against 22 clinical isolates (H. influenzae 5, B. catarrhalis 3, alpha-Streptococcus 3, S. pneumoniae 2, Corynebacterium sp. 2, S. aureus 1, P. aeruginosa 1, P. micros 1, Enterobacter cloacae 1, Escherichia coli 1, Group D Streptococcus 1 and Staphylococcus epidermidis 1) from children with bacterial infections. PAPM showed a good antibacterial activity comparable to the activity of cefoperazone (CPZ) against S. pneumoniae strains relatively tolerant to penicillins. However, the activity of PAPM against H. influenzae was somewhat weaker than that of CPZ. 3. Pharmacokinetic studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Immunobiological activities of bacteria isolated from the root canals of postendodontic teeth with persistent periapical lesions.
AB  - Although intraradicular bacteria are widely considered to be the primary etiological agents of periapical lesions, the immunobiological properties of the species in question are not adequately known. The aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate the pathobiological properties of the 10 most frequently isolated endodontopathic bacterial species. Using cellular components of the pathogens obtained by sonic extraction, we have investigated their ability to induce monocyte migration, interleukin 1 production, mitogenic responses of lymphocytes, and the polyclonal activation of B lymphocytes. It was found that all of the tested species enhanced the migration of monocytes and induced mitogenesis in B lymphocytes. The polyclonal activation of B cells and the induction of interleukin 1 by monocytes were found to be stronger in Gram-negative anaerobes. Furthermore, all of the tested species excluding Bacteroides oralis were poor T cell mitogens. These findings show that a wide range of pathobiological properties are attributable to the most frequently isolated endodontic pathogens. It thus seems plausible that a battery of complex immunological responses induced by such microbes lead to the formation of persistent periapical lesions.
TI  - In vitro activities of three semisynthetic amide derivatives of teicoplanin, MDL  62208, MDL 62211, and MDL 62873.
AB  - MDL 62208, MDL 62211, and MDL 62873 are three semisynthetic amide derivatives of  teicoplanin (MDL 62208 is an amide of teicoplanin aglycone, MDL 62211 is an amide of the teicoplanin A2 complex, and MDL 62873 is the corresponding derivative of peak A2-2 of the complex). The three semisynthetic glycopeptides were evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity in comparison with the parent drug (teicoplanin) and vancomycin. A variety of gram-positive bacteria of clinical origin, whose species were carefully determined and that included 428 staphylococci (207 methicillin susceptible and 221 methicillin resistant), 41 streptococci, 82 enterococci, 43 strains of Listeria monocytogenes, 10 JK coryneform bacteria, and 67 anaerobes belonging to the genera Clostridium, Propionibacterium, Peptostreptococcus, and Eubacterium, were tested. The only resistances to MDL 62208, MDL 62211, and MDL 62873 were encountered with vancomycin- and teicoplanin-resistant enterococci. All of the other test strains, including some teicoplanin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci of the species Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, were highly susceptible to the three teicoplanin amides. Only minor differences in activity were observed among MDL 62208, MDL 62211, and MDL 62873, whereas the three experimental compounds were usually found to be more potent than teicoplanin or vancomycin (especially against staphylococci, with differences mostly ranging from 2- to 16-fold). The MBC-to-MIC ratios varied depending on the organisms, with the highest ratios usually observed for enterococci and listeriae. Overall, the MBC-to-MIC ratios yielded by the teicoplanin analogs were slightly greater than those yielded by teicoplanin or vancomycin.
TI  - Enumeration of subgingival species on primary isolation plates using colony lifts.
AB  - This study evaluated the feasibility of using a colony lift method and DNA probes to enumerate bacterial species cultured on primary isolation plates. Fourteen digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal DNA probes representing 12 subgingival species were validated by hybridization with colony lifts prepared from 249 reference strains of 51 species grown on Trypticase soy agar plates supplemented with 5% sheep blood. Colonies of reference strains were lifted onto Nytran filters from plates and treated to lyse cells, remove cellular proteins, denature and fix microbial DNA to the filters. Positive reactions were detected with an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and revealed by bromo-chloro-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium. Cross-reactions were not observed for 13/14 probes, but 2 strains of Streptococcus mitis reacted with the probe to Streptococcus sanguis II. Subgingival plaque samples were taken by means of a sterile curette from mesiobuccal surfaces of teeth present in each of 26 subjects with differing periodontal disease states. Samples were dispersed, diluted, plated and incubated anaerobically for 7 d at 35 degrees C. Colonies were lifted as described above. Filters were cut into sections and hybridized with the 14 digoxigenin-labeled DNA probes. The probes were used to enumerate the test species and the total number of isolates was determined in 711 plaque samples. The colony lift method and DNA probes provided a sensitive, economical and quantitative method for enumerating cultivable microbial species in subgingival plaque samples. In addition, the amplification provided by growing the organisms on agar plates facilitated determination of numbers of organisms in small plaque samples, such as those from healthy sites.
TI  - The use of DNA probes to examine the distribution of subgingival species in subjects with different levels of periodontal destruction.
AB  - The present investigation examined the distribution of 14 subgingival species at  a total of 2299 sites in 90 subjects with different levels of periodontal destruction. Subgingival plaque samples taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth were anaerobically dispersed, diluted and plated on non selective media. After anaerobic incubation, colonies were lifted to nylon filters and specific species detected using digoxygenin-labeled whole chromosomal DNA probes. The mean total viable count for all sites in all subjects was 8.3 x 10(6). The probes accounted for an average of 27.8% of the total viable count. The % of subjects in which each species was detected was as follows; V. parvula, 98; B. intermedius I, 98; S. sanguis II, 96; B. intermedius II, 95; C. ochracea, 94; B. gingivalis, 91; S. sanguis I, 85; W. recta, 83; F. nucleatum ss. vincentii, 82; S. intermedius, 80; B. forsythus, 76; P. micros, 74; A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a, 62 and A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, 52. The % of sites colonized by each of the 14 test species varied considerably within different subjects. The median number of sites colonized by different species ranged from 3.6% for A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b to 43.5% for V. parvula. In half the subjects, the mean % of the total viable counts for each of the test species was less than 4%. When subjects were divided on the basis of % of sites at baseline with greater than 3 mm attachment loss, the 14 probes accounted for 29.9% of the microbiota in the localized disease group and 25% in the widespread disease group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Changes in the microbial flora of airline headset devices after their use.
AB  - The bacterial flora of 20 headset devices were evaluated before and after they were worn for 1 hour. Bacteria were recovered from all headsets, and their number increased from a mean (+/- standard deviation) of 60 +/- 5 organisms per device to 650 +/- 51 organisms per device (P less than .001). The predominant organisms recovered were Staphylococcus spp, Streptococcus spp, Propionibacterium spp, and Peptostreptococcus spp. This study demonstrates the presence of potential pathogens in headset devices, as well as the increase in the number of these pathogens after the headsets have been worn for 1 hour.
TI  - Predominant obligate anaerobes in human periodontal pockets.
AB  - This study was carried out to investigate the predominant anaerobic bacteria of periodontal pockets in patients with advanced periodontitis, who had no previous treatment other than supragingival scaling, no history of recent or chronic systemic illness, nor any intake of antibiotics within 6 weeks prior to bacteriological sampling. Care was taken not to ignore tiny-colony-forming anaerobes, by means of a stereoscope and an anaerobic glove box system. Out of 422 (100%) isolates, 380 (90%) were obligate anaerobes, suggesting that the environment in periodontal pockets was anaerobic and favors the growth of obligate anaerobes. Among the 380 obligate anaerobes isolated, strains belonging to Eubacterium (54%) were predominant, and many of them occurred in tiny colonies. The other obligate anaerobes isolated were assigned to Wolinella (9%), unidentified motile rods which resemble Wolinella (7%), Peptostreptococcus (6%), Fusobacterium (5%), Bacteroides (2%; including those reclassified to Prevotella and Porphyromonas) and Selenomonas (0.5%). Among the isolates, 67% were Gram-positive bacteria, including 59% of rods (mostly asaccharolytic Eubacterium), suggesting that these bacteria, particularly strains of the Eubacterium species, may play an important role in etiology of adult periodontitis.
TI  - The endodontic microflora revisited.
AB  - The microbial flora of 35 dental root canals were examined, taking care to maintain the viability of obligate anaerobes which accounted for 45% of total isolations, while streptococcal species accounted for 24% of the total species isolated. Individual root canals yielded a maximum of eight bacterial species. A total of 40 different species was isolated of which the most prevalent were the facultative anaerobe Streptococcus sanguis and the obligate anaerobe, Peptostreptococcus micros (both in 23% of root canals), followed by Eubacterium aerofaciens and the 'Streptococcus milleri group' (both 17%) then Prevotella melaninogenica (formerly Bacteroides melaninogenicus), Enterococcus faecalis and Prevotella oralis (formerly Bacteroides oralis), which were each isolated from 14% of root canals. Highly significant associations were discovered between four pairs of species, viz P. melaninogenica with P. micros, P. melaninogenica with P. oralis, Prevotella corporis with Streptococcus morbillorum and Actinomyces odontolyticus with E. faecalis.
TI  - The relative lethality of intestinal bacteria for gnotobiotic rats with experimental intestinal strangulation.
AB  - In eight experiments utilizing 28 animals each, germfree rats with and without ischemically or hemorrhagically strangulated closed loop intestinal segments were contaminated with either one of four common intestinal anaerobic bacteria, or a combination of two or three bacteria previously found to be innocuous in pure culture. The results showed that: a) in pure culture, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were innocuous; b) Fusobacterium necrophorum alone was a very lethal organism that produced intense, confluent, intraperitoneal, fibrous adhesions after four to six days; and c) mixed inoculum of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and/or Streptococcus faecalis was found to be lethal for gnotobiotic rats with intestinal strangulation. It is concluded that Fusobacterium necrophorum is so patent that it should be specifically treated with antibiotics when suspected or known to be present in clinical specimens. This gnotobiotic animal model will be useful to delineate the lethality of known combinations of intestinal bacteria.
TI  - Bacterial invasion of non-exposed dental pulp.
AB  - Anaerobic procedures were adopted to demonstrate the early bacterial invasion of  non-exposed dental pulps, and to isolate and identify the bacteria. Of 19 freshly extracted teeth which originally exhibited deep dentinal lesions, clinical examination and electric pulp testing showed that nine of them had no pulpal exposure. Thus the pulps of these teeth were covered by clinically sound dentine beneath the carious lesion. Bacteria were found to have invaded the pulps of six of these nine teeth. The predominant bacteria were obligate anaerobes belonging to the genera Eubacterium, Propionibacterium and Actinomyces. Other obligate anaerobes were Lactobacillus, Peptostreptococcus, Veillonella and Streptococcus. The bacterial composition resembled that of the deep layers of dentinal lesions described previously, suggesting that the bacteria isolated in this study had passed through some individual dentinal tubules, to invade the dental pulp.
TI  - [Analysis of 98 cases of thoracic empyema].
AB  - Ninety-eight cases of empyema thoracis admitted to Juntendo University Hospital between 1979 and 1990 were reviewed. Males accounted for 78 cases and females 20 cases. Thirteen pediatric patients ranged in age from 17 days to 4 years, while the 85 adult cases ranged from 16 to 89 years (mean: 58.4 years). The mortality rate increased with age. Fifty-three cases of community-acquired empyema thoracis consisted of 24 with no underlying disease (including 13 pediatric cases), and 29 with diabetes mellitus, alcoholic liver damage or chronic obstructive bronchopulmonary disease. Forty-five nosocomial empyema cases occurred after chest operation or thoracocentesis, or due to a subdiaphragmatic pathogenic condition or congestive heart failure complicated with aspiration pneumonia. In this series, 63 patients (64.3%) had para- or post-pneumonic empyema. Compared with the community-acquired infection cases, the mortality rate of the nosocomial infection cases was very high. Seventy-eight cases were culture-positive, including 3 positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The remaining 20 cases were culture-negative. In 75 cases of culture-positive pleural fluid, aerobic bacteria were isolated from 31 cases (mortality rate: 22.6%), anaerobes mixed with aerobes from 21 cases (mortality rate: 52.4%), and anaerobes only from 23 cases (mortality rate: 21.7%). Thus, the mortality rate of mixed infected cases was highest. Anaerobes were frequently isolated from the community-acquired empyema cases, and were often found in para- or postpneumonic lesions, including aspiration pneumonia. The most commonly encountered aerobe was Staphylococcus aureus. Among the anaerobes, Bacteroides spp., microaerophilic streptococcus, Peptostreptococcus and Fusobacterium spp. were most common. A single organism was isolated in pure culture from 39 cases. Single organisms isolated from fluids were more frequently aerobes (25) than anaerobes (14). The cases harboring Bacteroides spp. showed the worst outcome, with 11 deaths in 25 such cases.
TI  - [Empyema due to an anaerobic Streptococcus in childhood].
AB  - Anaerobic infections are quite rare in pediatric age, being that, they affect only neonates and immunodepressed patients. We think to be somewhat interesting to describe the case of our patient, a 9 year old boy, unaffected by any predisposing factor, came under our observation because of a severe respiratory distress. He showed evident clinical and radiological signs of pleural effusion in the right lung, together with a gas coil in the upper field and a left mediastinal shifting. A thoracentesis was then performed, giving rise to 600 ml of foul smelling purulent material; this procedure promptly improved his respiratory function. A permanent drainage trough the chest wall was set and an antibiotic therapy, based on the clinical picture and the character of the exudate, begun. In effect, the typical smell of the purulent material led us to suspect an anaerobic infection, and for this reason we employed the teicoplanin iv, a rarely used in the pediatric age drug. While blood cultures were negative for any organism, exudate cultures yielded Peptostreptococcus anaerobius; the last one resulted highly sensible following antibiogram to the previously chosen drug. The x-ray pattern and the rapid disappearing of the gas coil induced us to exclude further either congenital or acquired lung diseases. We conclude that, in absence of other proved sources of entry, the air presence in the pleural space was secondary to gas formation by the anaerobic micro-organism. The clinical course was very satisfactory allowing the patient to be dismissed on the 28th hospital day, with no need of further surgical therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Relation of baseline microbial parameters to future periodontal attachment loss.
AB  - The relationship between the level of subgingival species at baseline and subsequent attachment loss in a subject was examined. 38 subjects (14-71 years) with prior evidence of periodontal destruction were monitored 2x for pocket depth and attachment level at 6 sites per tooth at baseline and 2 months. A subject was considered to exhibit new attachment loss if 1 or more sites increased 3 mm or more in attachment level in 2 months. Subgingival plaque samples were taken at the baseline visit from the mesial aspect of each tooth (28 sites) using Gracey curettes. Samples were dispersed, diluted and plated on Trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood. After 7 days of anaerobic incubation, the colonies were lifted onto nylon filters, lysed and the DNA fixed to the filters. Digoxygenin-labeled DNA probes were used to enumerate 14 subgingival species. 17 of 38 subjects (44.7%) exhibited new attachment loss in 2 months. The % of the total viable count of each species was averaged for each subject. The species enumerated and the mean % of the total cultivable microbiota averaged across the active and inactive subjects were as follows; B gingivalis 2.3, 1.2; W. recta 1.3, 0.6; B. intermedius I 2.5, 2.0; B. forsythus 1.5, 1.2; A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a 1.1, 0.8; F. nucleatum ss vincentii 1.1, 1.0; S. intermedius 2.0, 1.9; P. micros 1.5, 1.5; B. intermedius II 1.6, 1.7; A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b 0.4, 0.6; S. sanguis I 1.8, 2.1; S. sanguis II 2.7, 3.0; V. parvula 3.9, 4.2; C. ochracea 0.9, 1.8.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Microbiologic causes and neonatal outcomes associated with chorioamnion infection.
AB  - Chorioamnion infection is associated with histologic chorioamnionitis and prematurity, but the specific chorioamnion microorganisms associated with histologic chorioamnionitis, prematurity, and poor neonatal outcome have not been identified. Bacteria were recovered from the chorioamnion cultures of 32% of 112 placentas delivered at less than or equal to 34 weeks' gestation and from 19% of 156 placentas delivered at greater than 34 weeks' gestation (odds ratio 2.1; 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 3.8). Chorioamnion bacteria most highly related to both prematurity and histologic chorioamnionitis were group B Streptococcus and Fusobacterium species. Chorioamnion infection with Peptostreptococcus was significantly related only to preterm delivery, and infection with Escherichia coli, Bacteroides, and Ureaplasma were significantly related to histologic chorioamnionitis. Among preterm infants, isolation of bacteria from the chorioamnion was related to an increased risk of neonatal death (rate ratio 3.8; 95% confidence interval 1.4 to 11.6). Bacterial infection of the chorioamnion is related to preterm birth, histologic chorioamnionitis, and neonatal death.
TI  - Predominant cultivable flora in pericoronitis.
AB  - The predominant cultivable flora in pericoronitis was investigated by culturing pus from affected sites in 20 patients. Twenty colonies were picked at random from non-selective plates and identified using conventional biochemical and physiological tests, analysis of metabolic end-products by gas chromatography and protein profile analysis. The most frequently isolated organisms were Prevotella (Bacteroides) intermedia, Peptostreptococcus micros, Veillonella species, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus mitis. Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis was not isolated and asaccharolytic Eubacterium species were virtually absent. The predominant cultivable microflora in pericoronitis was found to be highly anaerobic in nature and superficially similar to that found in chronic periodontitis, although proposed marker organisms of severe periodontitis were absent.
TI  - [Effects of antibiotics and anti-bacterial components of preparations for local treatment of suppurative wounds on pathogens of odonto- genic infections].
AB  - The results of identification and sensitivity assay of 156 strains of pathogens causing odontogenic infections are presented. In the sensitivity assay antibacterial drugs were used. 42.3 percent of the strains were obligate anaerobes belonging to Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Veillonella and Actinomyces. Significant differences in the microbial sensitivity to the drugs used for general and local therapy were detected. There was observed high sensitivity of the obligate anaerobes to gramicidin (0.02 micrograms/ml), nitazol (10 micrograms/ml), levomycetin and tetracycline (60 micrograms/ml). Antiseptics such as dioxidine and chlorhexidine used locally showed satisfactory results. The above mentioned drugs and especially levomycetin were also rather active against facultative organisms in associations of pathogens causing odontogenic infections: Bacillus coagulans, B. licheniformis, Pseudomonas sp., Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Staphylococcus sp. and Streptococcus sp.
TI  - Normal vaginal aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta).
AB  - The most common bacterial species isolated from the vaginas of 37 healthy rhesus  macaques were Streptococcus viridans, coagulase negative Staphylococcus, Mobiluncus curtisii ss. curtisii, Corynebacterium renale-like organisms, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Gardnerella-like organisms, and other Corynebacterium species. The vaginal flora of the rhesus macaque differs from that previously reported for five other primate species. A two-year retrospective review of clinical cases of vaginitis and metritis found Escherichia coli and coagulase positive Staphylococci to be the most common pathogens isolated.
TI  - [Bacteriological examination of infections in the field of oral surgery].
AB  - Etiology of bacterial infections in the field of oral surgery was studied. A total of 270 samples collected from patients with encapsulated abscess in their oral cavities was examined and bacteria were isolated from the 244 samples (90.4%). The following results were found; 1) Organisms more than one from one sample were frequently isolated from cases with parodontitis, pericoronitis and gnathitis. Isolation of anaerobic bacteria was common (54.2%). 2) Streptococcus milleri and Streptococcus sanguis and Capnocytophaga species were the most common isolates among aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respectively. 3) Peptostreptococcus micros and Eubacterium lentum were most frequent isolates among gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. Among gram-negative bacteria, Oral Group Bacteroides, especially Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides buccae and Bacteroides oralis were most prominent. 4) Isolation frequency of bacteria (both species and strains) was high from samples obtained from patients before antibiotic chemotherapy. 5) Most strains were sensitive to Midecamycin acetate and Josamycin. Minimum inhibitory concentration of 80% isolates (MIC80) against these antibiotics was 0.39 microgram/ml.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of ofloxacin against recent isolates from patients with community-acquired infections].
AB  - In order to survey antibacterial activities of ofloxacin (OFLX) against 1,440 bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired infections in 1987 and 1990, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the drug as well as those of other new quinolones and oral cephems were determined. The following conclusions were reached. 1. Comparison of the MIC distribution for strains isolated in 1987 with those in 1990 suggested a tendency toward an increase in the frequency of OFLX-resistant isolates with the passage of time of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella ssp., Enterobacter spp., Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Most common elevations of MIC values against these bacteria were observed in MIC80 and MIC90 values, while no significant alteration was observed in MIC50 values. However, MIC50's of OFLX against Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were relatively high for strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. Most of the OFLX-resistant strains of S. aureus seemed to be methicillin-resistant (MRSA). Furthermore, MIC80 of OFLX against coagulase-negative staphylococci was high in strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. 2. Susceptibility of Streptococcus spp. was evaluated only in strains isolated in 1990. The results were comparable to those reported by others in the early 1980s. 3. Bacteria which showed no or infrequent emergence of OFLX-resistant strains even in 1990 were Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Campylobacter spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. 4. Recently isolated strains from patients with community-acquired infections showed a tendency toward an increase of the frequency of OFLX-resistant strains among many bacteria. However, the bacteria which contained high percentages of OFLX-resistant strains except for MRSA were so-called less-virulent bacteria, and in the other bacteria elevations of MIC values were only observed in MIC80 and MIC90. These results suggested that OFLX preserved a potent antibacterial activity against bacteria which were major causative pathogens in community-acquired infections.
TI  - Effects of propicillin on mixed continuous cultures of periodontal bacteria.
AB  - Experiments were designed to test the antibiotic (1-phenoxypropyl)penicillin (propicillin) against a complex microflora of periodontal bacteria. This was accomplished by using a continuously growing mixed culture that was obtained by enrichment of periodontal plaque in human serum. Peptostreptococcus species, Prevotella intermedia, Lactobacillus, catenaforme, and Streptococcus species were dominant members of the enrichment culture. None of the strains isolated from the enrichment culture exhibited detectable beta-lactamase activity. MICs of propicillin for the organisms ranged from 0.1 to 1.2 mg/liter. Propicillin was added to the cultures in single doses that were repeated once or twice at 24-h intervals, that is, after 2.4 volume changes of the culture vessel. Analyses done 24 h after the last addition of propicillin revealed that total cell counts of the culture were hardly affected by 1 mg of propicillin per liter, although some changes in the microbial composition occurred. The relative insusceptibility of the culture might be explained by the low growth rate. Higher concentrations (5, 10, and 50 mg/liter) of the antibiotic caused 10- to 20-fold drops in total cell counts. In these cultures P. intermedia was selectively suppressed to below the detection level, whereas other organisms that were equally susceptible to propicillin were less affected. It was concluded that mixed continuous cultures are a useful tool for studying the effects of antibiotics against the periodontal microbiota.
TI  - Subgingival microflora of advanced periodontitis in the Dominican Republic.
AB  - A study of the predominant subgingival microflora was carried out in 24 periodontitis patients, 18 to 60 years of age, in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Paper point sampling, transport in VMGA III, and conventional microbiological techniques were utilized. Direct microscopic examination revealed that cocci and nonmotile organisms made up 85% of the total organisms and spirochetes as little as 3%. Nonselective culturing showed Gram-negative organisms to constitute 53% of total isolates. Fusobacterium nucleatum averaged 15%, black-pigmented anaerobes 7%, and Peptostreptococcus micros 10% of the cultivable microflora. Enteric rods and acinetobacter species were recovered from 16 patients and comprised 23% of the cultivable flora. Enterobacter cloacae occurred in 8 patients, Klebsiella oxytoca in 3 patients, and 7 other species in 10 patients. Parallel studies have found a significantly lower prevalence of enteric rods in advanced periodontitis patients in the USA. In conclusion, fewer spirochetes and markedly more enteric rods seem to inhabit adult periodontitis lesions in Santo Domingo patients compared to those in USA. High levels of subgingival enteric rods in periodontitis patients in Santo Domingo may have important prophylactic and therapeutic implications.
TI  - Bacteria in the apical 5 mm of infected root canals.
AB  - Ten freshly extracted teeth which had carious pulpal exposures and periapical lesions contiguous with the root apex were placed inside an anaerobic chamber and the apical 5 mm of the root canals cultured. In addition to anaerobic incubation, duplicate cultures were incubated aerobically. Fifty strains of bacteria from the 10 root canals were isolated and identified. The most prominent bacteria cultured from the 10 root canals were Actinomyces, Lactobacillus, black-pigmented Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, nonpigmented Bacteroides, Veillonella, Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Streptococcus mutans. Of the 50 bacterial isolates, 34 (68%) were strict anaerobes. This study demonstrates the presence of predominantly anaerobic bacteria in the apical 5 mm of infected root canals in teeth with carious pulpal exposures and periapical lesions.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the internal medicine].
AB  - Fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. There were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9 with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with fever of unknown origin. Forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. The overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. The efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), other Gram-positive coccus (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Serratia marcescens (3), Escherichia coli (3), Branhamella catarrhalis (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Enterobacter sp. (1), and Peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. P. aeruginosa (3) and Acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. S. aureus (1), S. epidermidis (1), P. aeruginosa (5), and S. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. The eradication rate was 83.7%. Six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of S-GOT 2. But all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. These findings indicate that IPM/CS is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological findings on newly inserted hydroxyapatite-coated and pure titanium human dental implants.
AB  - The clinical and microbiologic features of 30 hydroxyapatite-coated root-form endosseous dental implants (Tri-Stage) were compared to 10 similar pure titanium implants without hydroxyapatite coatings. In 7 of 9 partially edentulous patients studied, pure titanium fixtures were placed adjacent to hydroxyapatite-coated implants. Implants in the maxilla were submerged beneath mucosal tissues after implant placement for a minimum of 6 months, and in the mandible for at least 4 months. All patients were prescribed short-term beta-lactam antibiotic therapy after fixture placement, and 8 of 9 used chlorhexidine mouthrinses after fixture exposure. Clinical and microbiological examination was carried out 7-10 months after fixed prosthetic loading of the implants. Clinical measurements included the gingival index, plaque index, bleeding on probing and peri-implant probing depths determined with the Florida Probe system. Subgingival microbial samples were collected with paper points and transported in VMGA III. Specimens were examined by direct phase-contrast microscopy and were plated onto nonselective and selective culture media for anaerobic and aerobic incubation. No significant mean clinical or microbiological differences were found between the implant types, although one hydroxyapatite-coated implant exhibited deep probing depths, bleeding on probing and marked radiographic crestal bone loss. Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mitis were the most predominant organisms recovered from clinically stable implants, whereas high proportions of Fusobacterium species and Peptostreptococcus prevotii were isolated from the ailing hydroxyapatite-coated implant. One or more implants in 8 of the study subjects yielded enteric rods, pseudomonads, enterococci or staphylococci. The prognosis of implants with varying early microbiotas needs to be established in longitudinal studies.
TI  - [Randomized study of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid versus amoxicillin-metronidazole combinations in pyogenic infections of dental origin].
AB  - Thirty patients, without any valve defect, cardiac malformation or previous antibiotic administration and presenting dental infections, have been treated either with amoxycillin-clavulanic acid or amoxycillin and metronidazole. Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria have been isolated. These infections were due to mixed flora. Nearly one half of anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus, S. milleri and S. sanguis being predominant among aerobes. The species identified were those found in the mouth in the absence of infection becoming as opportunistic flora. The percentage of cures was equivalent in the two groups. the association amoxycillin-clavulanic acid seems to be as active as amoxycillin + metronidazole on the microflora isolated from dentogenous pyogenic infections.
TI  - Bacteriological investigations of clinical mastitis in heifers in Sweden.
AB  - Bacterial analyses were carried out of 2069 udder secretions, isolated from 1481  heifers with mastitis in eight veterinary districts in Sweden. Streptococci, e.g. Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Str. uberis, dominated the bacterial flora, being isolated from 34.4 and 19.5% respectively of heifers with clinical mastitis occurring from puberty up to 14 d post partum. Bacterial species generally regarded as important pathogens in the summer mastitis complex, e.g. Actinomyces pyogenes, Stuart-Schwan coccus and strictly anaerobic bacteria such as Peptostreptococcus indolicus, Fusobacterium necrophorum and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were isolated at low frequencies (13.2, 6.3, 9.4, 3.8 and 1.3% respectively). When the cases of mastitis studied were restricted to those appearing in heifers pre partum, May 15 to October 14 (summer mastitis), these bacterial species were isolated at higher percentages (27.1, 14.4, 21.4, 13.5 and 5.2% respectively). These figures were, nevertheless, still lower than those published in reports from other countries. Whether considered up to 14 d post partum or only pre partum, there were no significant differences in the frequencies of A. pyogenes isolated at different seasons. There were geographical differences in bacterial incidence, e.g. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated significantly more often in northern regions whereas Str. dysgalactiae was more common in the south. This and other Swedish investigations support the theory that A. pyogenes and strictly anaerobic bacteria are 'secondary invaders' that depend on Str. dysgalactiae to cause a primary infection. It is stressed that the udders of all heifers should be examined daily so that cases of mastitis can be treated immediately.

TI  - Native valve infective endocarditis in adults--analysis of 32 consecutive cases over a ten-year period from 1980 to 1989.
AB  - Thirty-two patients with native valve infective endocarditis who presented over a 10-year period at our hospital were analyzed retrospectively. The presenting symptom was a persistent fever in 22 patients. In 30 patients, the New York Heart Association functional class was less than II before the development of endocarditis. Blood cultures were positive on all occasions in 24 out of 29 culture-positive patients. All of the viridans streptococci, accounting for 79% of the isolated pathogens, were highly susceptible to ampicillin. Treatment consisted of a 6 week course of antibiotics, usually ampicillin, at a dose of 12 grams/day. In 9 cases, we had to change or stop the antibiotics because of severe side effects. The longer the period before making a diagnosis, the more severe were the symptoms of congestive heart failure and the more frequent was the incidence of cerebral hemorrhage. To initiate treatment as early as possible, in order to minimize valve destruction and to reduce the risk of cerebral hemorrhage, serial blood cultures are recommended in patients with valvular heart disease or congenital heart disease and a persistent fever, with minimal cardiac symptoms.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of peritonsillar abscess.
AB  - Thirty-four aspirates of pus from peritonsillar abscesses that were studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria showed bacterial growth. A total 107 bacterial isolates (58 anaerobic and 49 aerobic and facultative) were recovered, accounting for 3.1 isolates per specimen (1.7 anaerobic and 1.4 aerobic and facultatives). Anaerobic bacteria only were present in 6 (18%) patients, aerobic and facultatives in 2 (6%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora in 26 (76%). Single bacterial isolates were recovered in 4 infections, 2 of which were Streptococcus pyogenes and 2 were anaerobic bacteria. The predominant bacterial isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (6 isolates), Bacteroides sp (21 isolates, including 15 Bacteroides melaninogenicus group), and Peptostreptococcus sp (16) and S. pyogenes (10). beta-Lactamase-producing organisms were recovered from 13 (52%) of 25 specimens tested. This retrospective study highlights the polymicrobial nature and importance of anaerobic bacteria in peritonsillar abscess.
TI  - Oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  - Two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. Of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (Peptostreptococcus (1); Eubacterium (9); Clostridium (6); Veillonella (6); Megasphera (1); Bacteroides (28); Fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (P. anaerobius (1); E. fossor (9); C. villosum (1); B. fragilis (1); B. tectum (2); B. heparinolyticus (2)). Three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (LRT) or paraoral (PO) bacterial infections. Of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. Phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. Among the obligately anaerobic species, Gram-positive cocci including P. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, E. fossor 11% and other Gram-positive rods (excluding Clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. The Gram-negative rods comprised B. fragilis 5%, B. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented Bacteroides 3% and other Bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of Fusobacterium (7%), and Gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. Among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by Pasteurella spp. 19%, Escherichia coli 17%, Actinomyces spp. 9%, Streptococcus spp. 9%. Incidental facultative isolates were Enterococcus spp. 2%, Enterobacter cloaceae 2%, Actinobacillus spp. 2% and Gram-negative corroding rods 5%. On the basis of the similarities (as determined by DNA hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. E. fossor and B. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and LRT and PO diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.
TI  - Antibody response in immunized rabbits measured with bacterial immunoglobulin-binding proteins.
AB  - Protein G, an immunoglobulin (Ig)-binding protein isolated from group C or G streptococci, binds to the Fc portion of IgG. Protein L, from the anaerobic bacterium Peptostreptococcus magnus, specifically binds light chains of Ig. In this study, protein G and L were used to measure the production of antibodies in immunized rabbits. Two rabbits were immunized with a mixture of human urinary proteins from a patient with tubular proteinuria, and blood samples were collected regularly from the animals for 6 weeks after the immunization. The antibody levels of the blood samples against six of the proteins in the antigen mixture were then measured by ELISA. Microtiter plates were coated with each of the antigens, incubated with the rabbit serum samples, and the specific antibodies of the IgG class measured by incubation with biotinylated protein G, and antibodies of all Ig classes with biotinylated protein L. Alternatively, Western blotting was employed, where the antibodies which bound to each antigen after separation by SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, were detected by protein G or L. The results showed that antibody production against five of the antigens, albumin, alpha 1 gamma-acid glycoprotein, alpha 1 gamma-microglobulin, Ig light chains, and retinol-binding protein, showed a similar pattern, although the magnitude of the initial IgM response differed somewhat. After 6 weeks, the levels of the protein G-binding antibodies had reached a plateau, while those of protein L-binding antibodies were still increasing. The response to the sixth antigen, beta 2 microglobulin, was considerably different. A dramatic increase of anti-beta 2 gamma-microglobulin antibodies was seen during the 4th week after immunization when protein L was used.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - Localization and identification of root canal bacteria in clinically asymptomatic periapical pathosis.
AB  - Twenty-one teeth with clinically asymptomatic periapical pathosis (class 3) were  extracted and the isolation, identification, and localization of bacteria in the root apex were examined. Mixtures involving several bacteria were isolated from more than 60% of the cases. Scanning electron microscopy revealed bacterial masses to be associated with the apical part of the root canal, but not with the area of apical foramen or on the surface of root apex. Our results indicate that the bacteria in class 3 cases may be derived from organisms which colonized before or during endodontic treatment, but not from anachoresis. The bacteria-positive cases of asymptomatic periapical pathosis have the potential to progress to symptomatic periapical pathosis.
TI  - [Asporogenic anaerobic empyema--clinical and bacteriological investigations of 31 patients with anaerobic empyema].
AB  - The author reviewed the records of 31 patients with asporogenic anaerobic empyema mostly seen in the wards of Internal Medicine, Juntendo University Hospital during the 27 years between 1961 and 1988, and obtained the following results. 1. There were 25 males and 8 females with an average age of 57.8 and 51.0 y/o (range, 25 to 79 y/o), respectively males more than forty years old occupied 74.2 percent of all cases. 28 patients (90%) had underlying conditions. 2. The cases of mixed infections with anaerobes and aerobes were only 22.6%. 3. The isolated bacteria were microaerophilic streptococcus, Bacteroides spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., Fusobacterium spp. etc. in this order. 4. There were no relationships between anaerobic infections with or without aerobes and putrid odor of pleural effusion. 5. Bacteroides spp. were isolated most in the group with putrid pleural effusion, however, they were not isolated in the group without putrid pleural effusion at all. This fact suggests that there is an intimate relationship between putrid odor and Bacteroides spp. 6. There was no deceased case which pleural effusion had been drained sufficiently with open or closed drainage. It suggests that sufficient drainage is the most important in therapeutic procedures of asporogenic anaerobic empyema.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Management of empyema thoracis.
AB  - Over a 5-year period, 65 adult patients with empyema thoracis were treated. The cause of the empyema was postpneumonic in 52%, postresectional in 24%, a complication of minor surgical procedures in 14%, posttraumatic in 5%, and the result of miscellaneous causes in 5%. In the postpneumonic group, infection resulted from a single aerobic organism in 41%, multiple aerobic organisms in 9%, single anaerobic organisms in 12%, and mixed aerobic-anaerobic organisms in 18%. Peptostreptococcus, Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, and diphtheroids were the most common organisms, accounting for 55% of bacterial isolates. All 34 patients with postpneumonic empyema were initially treated with drainage, which was successful in two thirds. The remainder, 12 patients, ultimately required thoracotomy. Decortication was combined with intrathoracic transposition of extrathoracic skeletal muscles in 9 patients. There was no reoperation or recurrence of infection, and thoracoplasty was avoided; residual spaces were filled by the transposed muscle.
TI  - Use of modified norleucine-tyrosine broth in identification of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  - Gas-liquid chromatography was employed to analyze the volatile and nonvolatile acids produced in modified norleucine-tyrosine (MNT) broth by various gram-positive cocci. The MNT broth consists of 0.5% Trypticase (BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md.), 0.5% yeast extract (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.), 0.2% L-norleucine, and 0.1% L-tyrosine. The microorganisms included reference strains and clinical isolates of Peptostreptococcus spp. (P. anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. indolicus, P. magnus, and P. prevotii), Staphylococcus spp. (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. saccharolyticus), and Streptococcus spp. (S. agalactiae, S. intermedius, S. mutans, S. sanguis I, and S. sanguis II). Only Peptostreptococcus anaerobius strains produced caproic and valeric acids in MNT broth cultures. All 11 P. anaerobius strains produced valeric acid in MNT broth, and only 1 strain failed to produce caproic acid in the medium. This unique feature aids in rapid, reliable identification of P. anaerobius with a minimum number of tests.
TI  - Recolonization of the subgingival microflora after scaling and root planing in human periodontitis.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the recolonization patterns of the subgingival microflora of adult periodontitis patients after a single session of scaling and root planing. In each of eight patients, three clinically diseased sites were investigated microbiologically by darkfield microscopy and cultural analysis. After initial clinical and microbiological parameters were determined, each subject received a single session of scaling and root planing but no oral hygiene instructions. Clinical indices were measured and microbial parameters were reassessed 7, 21, and 60 days after treatment in a manner such that each of the test sites was sampled only once after treatment. Recolonization was evaluated by matching any single site with its own preoperative site. A significant improvement in probing depth was noted for up to 60 days after treatment, while the gingival index did not change markedly during the course of the study. The microbial composition of treated sites 7 days after scaling and root planing, as determined by both cultural and darkfield data, was similar to that of periodontally healthy sites. Differences between cultural and darkfield data became apparent at the 21 day sampling point. The darkfield data showed that the sites consisted of cocci with few spirochetes. Cultural data demonstrated that the majority of the cocci were anaerobic, namely Streptococcus intermedius, Veillonella parvula, and Peptostreptococcus micros. At 60 days, there was no significant variation in any of the parameters from pretreatment levels. The most prevalent anaerobic rods prior to and 60 days after therapy were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides gingivalis, and B. intermedius.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Susceptibility of oral bacteria to phenoxyethanol and phenoxyethanol/chlorhexidine combinations.
AB  - A total of 57 bacterial strains (26 different species) which may be isolated from subgingival plaque were tested for their in vitro susceptibility to phenoxycthanol, a commonly-used antiseptic and preservative. Ninety-five percent of the strains, including those associated with chronic inflammatory periodontal disease, were susceptible to concentrations of phenoxyethanol used topically (2% w/v). Phenoxyethanol at a concentration of 1% (w/v) was also found that to have a rapid bactericidal effect achieving a 99.9% kill in 5 minutes or less for species such as Bacterodides gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens, and Wolinella recta. Addition of chlorhexidine to phenoxyethanol resulted in a mixture with increased antibacterial activity. For most bacterial strains, the presence of chlorhexidine resulted in at least a four-fold decrease in the concentration of pheoxyethanol required for inhibition of growth. These results imply that phenoxyethanol may be useful in the treatment of chronic inflammatory periodontal disease either by itself or in combination with chlorhexidine.
TI  - The formation of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan by oral bacteria.
AB  - The capacity to form volatile sulfur compounds was tested in bacteria isolated from subgingival microbiotas and in a representative number of reference strains. A majority of the 75 tested oral bacterial species and 7 unnamed bacterial taxa formed significant amounts of hydrogen sulfide from L-cysteine. The most active bacteria were found in the genera Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium, Selenomonas, Centipeda, Bacteroides and Fusobacterium. Methyl mercaptan from L-methionine was formed by some members of the genera Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, Porphyromonas and Eubacterium. When incubated in serum for 7 d, the most potent producers of hydrogen sulfide were Treponema denticola and the black-pigmented species, Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides loescheii, Porphyromonas endodontalis and Porphyromonas gingivalis. P. endodontalis and P. gingivalis also produced significant amounts of methyl mercaptan in serum. No other volatile sulfur compound was detected in serum or in the presence of L-cysteine and L-methionine. These findings significantly increase the list of oral bacteria known to produce volatile sulfur compounds.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of human neutrophils and sera on selected endodontic pathogenic bacteria in an anaerobic environment.
AB  - Phagocytosis by normal human neutrophils and the bactericidal activity of normal  human pooled serum were measured under anaerobic conditions on six endodontic pathogenic bacterial species from the genera Actinomyces, Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus and Streptococcus. The results revealed that Actinomyces viscosus was not killed either by human neutrophils or by 20 per cent serum; Peptostreptococcus anaerobius was not killed by either 20 per cent or 95 per cent serum; and Bacteroides intermedius was susceptible to both 20 per cent and 95 per cent serum, but was not killed by neutrophils after exposure for 20 minutes. The other species showed intermediate susceptibility patterns. Such results suggest that oral pathogens vary with regard to the bactericidal effects of these two host defense mechanisms, and that this variation may at least in part explain the relative quantities of microbes recovered in certain oral infections.
TI  - The microbiology of chronic sinus disease in children with respiratory allergy.
AB  - Chronic maxillary sinusitis is common in children with respiratory allergy and is associated with increased morbidity. The bacteriology of chronic sinus disease in these children has not been adequately evaluated. Between May 1987 and January 1988, 12 children (aged 3 to 9 years), all with documented respiratory allergy and chronic respiratory symptoms consistent with chronic sinusitis (greater than 30 days), were fully evaluated. History, physical examination, complete blood count, nasal smear, and Waters x-ray were done. All patients had opacification of one or both maxillary sinuses, failed to respond to multiple courses of antibiotics, and subsequently underwent maxillary sinus aspiration and irrigation. Specimens were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic organisms with standard technique, and sensitivities were obtained. Culture results revealed a single organism (Moraxella [Branhamella] catarrhalis) in five patients, one patient yielded M. catarrhalis plus Streptococcus species, three were negative, and three patients grew multiple organisms (two with multiple aerobic streptococcal species and one patient with aerobic streptococci and Peptostreptococcus). All children received appropriate culture-directed antimicrobial therapy. Sequential biweekly follow-up revealed progressive radiographic clearing and significant symptomatic improvement. M. catarrhalis is a common pathogen, whereas anaerobic organisms are unusual as a cause of chronic maxillary sinusitis in allergic children. Some children, despite negative cultures, may benefit from maxillary sinus irrigation.
TI  - Clinical, pathologic, and microbiologic findings of foot abscess in neonatal pigs.
AB  - A longitudinal study was undertaken in a swine herd with an ever-present problem  of foot abscess in suckling pigs reared on a woven-wire floor. Of 3,322 4-day-old pigs, 199 (6%) developed abscess lesions involving claws and accessory digits before weaning. Lesions were first detected in 4-day-old pigs; median and mean ages at onset were 10 and 11.3 days, respectively. At first detection, most pigs had only a single claw affected, but 39 pigs had at least 2 claws with abscesses. Hind limbs had more affected claws (140) than forelimbs (96). In the hind limbs, medial claws were most likely to have lesions, whereas the reverse was true for the forelimbs. Gross and microscopic examinations of affected claws indicated necrotic pododermatitis, with severe osteomyelitis, arthritis, and tenosynovitis. Bacteria isolated from foot abscess lesions included Actinomyces pyogenes, Staphylococcus spp, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus spp, Actinobacillus spp, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium spp, Bacteroides spp, and Peptostreptococcus spp.
TI  - [A clinical study on ceftazidime in the treatment of intractable respiratory infections].
AB  - Ceftazidime (CAZ) was administered to 51 patients (37 males, 14 females) with respiratory infections including severe cases, accompanied by various underlying respiratory diseases. The clinical efficacy and side effects of CAZ were investigated. The mean age and body weight of these 51 cases were 62.6 years and 48.0 kg, respectively. CAZ was administered by intravenous drip infusion (daily dose of 2-4 g) for a mean of 14.7 days to a mean total dose of 56.7 g. Clinical efficacy rates were 64% (18 of 28 cases), 80% (16 of 20 cases) and 67% (2 of 3 cases) for airway and intermediary regional infections, pneumonia (including lung abscess) and pyothorax, respectively. In the bacteriological study, efficacy rates and bacterial eradication rates were 69% and 67%, 33% and 20%, 100% and 100%, and 100% and 100% for infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 cases), Staphylococcus aureus (6 cases), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6 cases) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4 cases), respectively, and bacterial eradication was achieved in both of 2 cases of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and 2 cases of Haemophilus influenzae, and 1 case each of Peptococcus sp., Fusobacterium necrophorum and Serratia marcescens. Side effects observed were eruption in 1 case (2%) and elevated GOT, GPT and Al-P values in 1 case (2%), but these cases tended to recover after CAZ treatment was discontinued.
TI  - [A case of cervico-mediastinal abscess, secondary to acute tonsillitis: investigation of the treatments].
AB  - No other infectious diseases in the field of otolaryngology cause rapid and lethal course than cervical abscess. A case of cervicomediastinal abscess secondary to acute tonsillitis was presented. The patient was a 43-year-old male with liver cirrhosis and primarily had the treatment of tonsillitis. The complication of duodenal perforation caused marked general deteriotation, and cervical abscess occured. Immediately after transfer to our department, he was treated by cervical drainage, laparotomy and chemotherapy. However, hepatic failure occured, and he died of sepsis on the 16th day after the onset of tonsillitis. Cervicomediastinal abscesses were classified according to severity in Stage 1-4. 34 cases of advanced cervical abscess were reported in Japan from 1976 to 1989. These cases were analyzed statistically in terms of primary focus of infection, surgical procedures, clinical isolates and chemotherapy, etc., and following results were obtained. 1) Primary focus; approximately 50% was due to the infection of the tonsills and the pharynx occupied about 50%, and the odontogenic infections, approximately 40%. 2) Surgical procedures; the neck doranaige approaching through the vertical incision resulted more effective. 3) Clinical isolates; aerobes and anaerobes accounted for 50% each of all strains. alpha-Streptococcus was predominant among aerobes, and Peptostreptococcus and Bacteroides were predominant among anaerobes. In order to confirm pathogenic bacteria of cervical abscess, clinical isolates of peritonsiller abscess and mandibular ostesis were compared with those of cervical abscess, because these infections are primary infectious diseases of cervical abscess.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Relationship of bacteriologic characteristics to semen indices in men attending an infertility clinic.
AB  - Bacteria can be isolated from most seminal fluid samples, but the significance of these microorganisms is uncertain because most men lack symptoms associated with bacterial infection of the reproductive tract. We obtained semen samples from 37 men attending a Special Infertility Clinic and assessed the relationship between seminal fluid microorganisms and seminal fluid analysis including sperm motility, morphology, and concentration; the numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other white blood cells; and the hamster zona-free oocyte sperm penetration assay. Aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 36 of the 37 samples. One hundred eighty-eight isolates (113 aerobes, 74 anaerobes, and one yeast) were recovered, with a mean of 5.2 isolates per semen specimen. The microorganisms recovered from the samples included: coagulase-negative staphylococci (89%), viridans streptococci (65%), diphtheroids (86%), Peptostreptococcus sp (62%), Bacteroides sp (27%), Gardnerella vaginalis (19%), Lactobacillus sp (16%), Actinomyces sp (16%), Enterococcus (11%), and Veillonella (11%). Other microorganisms including group B streptococcus, Hemophilus, Escherichia coli, Mobiluncus, and Clostridium were each recovered from fewer than 10% of the specimens. When the microbiology of seminal fluid specimens with or without polymorphonuclear leukocytes was compared, the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the semen was not associated with the isolation of staphylococci (33 versus 25%), viridans streptococci (33 versus 28%), Bacteroides sp (17 versus 37%), or Peptostreptococcus (31 versus 33%) (P greater than .05 for each comparison). The proportion of semen samples yielding bacterial isolates was similar after categorization by normal motility (more than 60%), pyospermia (six or more leukocytes per 100 sperm), sperm concentration, morphology, and a normal sperm penetration assay (11% or more).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - A rapid diagnosis of anaerobic infection in the oro-maxillary region by gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - The relationship between volatile fatty acids (VFAs) in pus and infecting bacterial species was examined in order to establish a rapid identification system for anaerobic microorganisms in purulent inflammation in the oro-maxillary region. VFAs were detected by the direct injection of pus into gas-liquid chromatography (GLC). Bacterial examination was carried out by anaerobic culture using blood agar plates. The bacterial identification was carried out mainly according to the VPI manual. Analysis of the direct VFA patterns of each sample resulted in 5 groups. The following bacterial species were the main isolates in each group: Streptococcus intermedius in Group A, Peptostreptococcus micros in Group B, Fusobacterium nucleatum in Group C, Bacteroides gingivalis in Group D, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius in Group E. The profile of VFAs produced in the PYG culture medium of the above isolated bacteria was compared with the direct VFA patterns. Agreement ratios between direct and PYG VFA patterns were as follows: Group A, 47.1%; Groups B and C, 45.0%; Group D, 87.5%; and Group E, 62.9%. The acetic acid concentration was more than 14 x 10(-4) meq/ml in Group B, the butyric acid concentration was more than 7 x 10(-4) meq/ml in Group C, and the iso-caproic acid concentration was more than 14 x 10(-4) meq/ml in Group E. In these cases, it was found that the agreement ratios between the direct and PYG FVA pattern were high. In Group D, irrespective of the concentration of iso-valeric acid detected, the agreement ratio was very high. The antibiotic susceptibility of the isolates was studied. Efficiency rates of ABPC, PIPC, CCL, CEZ, CMZ, SBT/CPZ, JM, CLDM, MINO and GM were relatively low and resistant rates were high for the gram-negative rods.
TI  - Summer mastitis in heifers: a bacteriological examination of secretions from clinical cases of summer mastitis in Denmark.
AB  - A total of 166 samples of secretions collected from Danish heifers suffering from clinically diagnosed summer mastitis were examined bacteriologically. One hundred and sixty three samples yielded positive findings whereas no growth was obtained from 3 specimens. The majority of samples revealed a mixed flora in which the predominant components were Actinomyces pyogenes, Peptostreptococcus indolicus, a microaerophilic coccus (Stuart-Schwan coccus), Fusobacterium necrophorum, Bacteriodes melaninogenicus and Streptococcus dysgalactiae. Pure cultures were recovered in only 7% of cases. P. indolicus was isolated from 875 of the cases, a microaerophilic coccus from 84%, A. pyogenes from 72%, Fusobacterium necrophorum from 52%, Str. dysgalactiae from 37%, B. melaninogenicus from 33% and various unidentified obligate anaerobic Gram-negative rods from 31%. The results confirm the complex bacterial aetiology of summer mastitis.
TI  - The microbial flora from root canals and periodontal pockets of non-vital teeth associated with advanced periodontitis.
AB  - Microflora from root canals and periodontal pockets of periodontally affected teeth were compared in order to elucidate the as yet unknown relationship between pulpal and periodontal disease. Caries-free teeth affected with advanced periodontitis and diagnosed as clinically dead by electric pulp testing were selected. The root canals and periodontal pockets were sampled, and the bacterial flora examined by both culture and interference microscopy. The results indicated that the aerobe/anaerobe ratio in the periodontal pocket was 0.23, while it was 0.0022 in the root canal, the large predominance of obligate anaerobes reflecting the anaerobic environment found in the root canal. Morphological classification obtained from interference microscopy showed similar proportions of morphotypes in the two sites. Results of anaerobic culture demonstrated a significantly higher rate of detection of facultative Streptococcus bacteria in the periodontal pocket than in the root canal. The predominant bacterial species common to both regions were Streptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium, Bacteroides, and Fusobacterium for obligate anaerobes. As for facultative anaerobes, Actinomyces and Streptococcus were detected predominantly in the periodontal pocket. The occurrence of micro-organisms common to both sites in this study suggests that the periodontal pocket may be a possible source of root canal infections.
TI  - [A microbiologic study on anaerobic bacteremia after dental extraction].
AB  - It has been known for many years that tooth extraction can cause bacterial dissemination into blood stream, that is, bacteremia. Besides endocarditis--causing bacteria, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, anaerobes are involved in the post- extraction bacteremia. They are of clinical importance because they can cause abscesses in the various parenchymatous organs such as the liver, lung, and brain through anachoresis. The purpose of this study is to establish the types of species of anaerobes associated with post--extraction bacteremia, and to give the baseline to the succeeding study of sensitivity tests of various antibiotics, thus clinicians can chose the right ones. 10ml of blood was sampled pre- and post- operatively from 32 patients and incubated in anaerobic chamber. The followings are the results of this study. 1. All the preoperative blood samples showed negative culture. 2. Postoperative blood samples from 8 out of 10 patients (80%) in group 1, from 1 out of 15 (73.3%) in group 2, and 2 out of 7 (28.6%) in group 3 yielded anaerobic and facultative species. 3. Organisms detected were species belonging to the genera Streptococcus, Bacteroides, Actinomyces, Staphylococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Peptococcus, Propionebacterium, Fusobacterium, nonenterococcus, and Corynebacterium.
TI  - Genetic basis of tetracycline resistance in urogenital bacteria.
AB  - The distributions of the nucleotide sequences related to the tetracycline resistance determinants Tet K, Tet L, Tet M, and Tet O were studied by dot blot hybridization with randomly chosen clinical urogenital tract isolates of viridans group streptococci, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Lactobacillus spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus spp., and Veillonella parvula. Among the Peptostreptococcus spp., 79% of the isolates hybridized with one (64%) or more (36%) of the probes for Tet K (27%), Tet L (30%), Tet M (75%) and Tet O (13%). Of the viridans group streptococci, 82% of the strains hybridized with one (34%) or more (66%) of the four probes. The distribution of the four determinants in this group was as follows: Tet K, 36%; Tet L, 31%; Tet M, 43%; Tet O, 61%. Twenty-nine percent of the enterococci and forty-six percent of the group B streptococci hybridized with the probes; however, the Tet K, Tet L, and Tet O determinants were found in only a few strains, while the Tet M determinant predominated. A total of 29% of the F. nucleatum isolates, 55% of the G. vaginalis isolates, and 26% of the V. parvula isolates hybridized with the Tet M determinant. In contrast, 43% of the Lactobacillus spp. hybridized with the Tet O determinant. The data indicate that tetracycline resistance determinants are common to many of the microorganisms isolated from the urogenital tract.
TI  - [Mitral valve prolapse in infective endocarditis. Incidence and characteristics].
AB  - PURPOSE valve prolapse (MVP) cases, complicated with infective endocarditis (IE), seen at a cardiologic reference hospital. METHODS: The MVP cases were diagnosed within a series of 276 cases of IE without previous cardiac surgery with clinical-echocardiographic criteria. We emphasised in our study; a) incidence; b) age and sex distribution; c) risk factors for IE; d) clinical-bacteriological data; e) echocardiographic features; f) therapeutic aspects; f) evolution and complications. RESULTS: a) We diagnosed 40 (14.4%) cases of MVP; b) mean age of 40.6 years, with 29 men (72.5%); c) dental procedures without prophylactic antibiotic-therapy in seven patients (17.5%), mitral regurgitation in 33 (82.5%), mitral valve redundancy in six (15%); d) fever was found in all patients (100%), cachexia was diagnosed in eight (20%), polyarthritis in six (15%) and congestive heart failure in six (15%). A systolic murmur of mitral regurgitation was found in all the patients and a nonejective click was encountered in four (10%), a Streptococcus was cultivated in 30 (75%), Staphylococcus in three (7.5%) Haemophilus sp in three (7.5%) Peptostreptococcus products in one (2.5%) and negative in three (7.5%) patients; e) echocardiographic signs of vegetation in 23 (57.5%), mitral regurgitation in 33 (82.5%), rupture of mitral chordae in 11 (27.5%) and mitral redundance in six (15.2%); f) 37 (92.5%) patients were medically treated and three (7.5%) required surgery; g) we registered in the hospital evolution: stroke in 10 (25%) and noncerebral mycotic aneurysm in 2 (5%) cases, two patients died (5%), one due to a hemorrhagic complication after surgery of bioprosthesis implantation and another of rupture of a cerebral mycotic aneurysm. CONCLUSION: The MVP was frequent in the population of patients with IE with of patients with mitral regurgitation, and male with mean age greater than the other cases. We observed low incidence of surgical need (7.5%) and lethal outcome (5%) but frequent (25%) neurological complications.
TI  - An in vitro method to study the adherence of bacteria to saliva-treated tooth enamel sections.
AB  - An in vitro bacterial adherence assay which employed human tooth enamel sections  precoated with saliva and an epifluorescent staining technique with acridine orange was developed. The assay was used to study the adherence properties of fresh and type strains of the following oral bacterial species: Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Capnocytophaga species, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Peptostreptococcus species, Veillonella species, Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus sanguis. Approximately half of the bacteria tested adhered well to enamel, including the fresh isolates of B. gingivalis, B. intermedius, Veillonella species and S. sanguis. Adherence did not correlate in all cases with the known distribution of these species in vivo. Three-quarters of the fresh strains adhered better than the type strains of the same species. The assay method is an alternative to the widely used hydroxyapatite bead assay.
TI  - [Effect of helium-neon-laser radiation on microbes].
AB  - In a well-defined in-vitro experiment the effects of a He-Ne-laser of 6 mW output on some dominating microbes in the oral cavity were studied by using a scanning electron microscope. No changes on the surface in the irradiated colonies could be seen even after an exposition lasting for 60 minutes (continuous or pulsated wave). Therefore an antibacterial effect of softlaser-irradiation sometimes described in literature in questionable.
TI  - [Significance of the bacterial flora in the etiology of apical periodontitis. Qualitative, quantitative and topographical aspects].
AB  - In the international literature it is shown the central role of root canal infection in the etiology of periapical lesions. As a matter of fact it has been proved (13) that sterile necrotic pulp tissue is completely unable to cause inflammatory reactions at the periapex. Infection of endodontic origin extends to the supporting tissues of the tooth only in the case of their acute inflammation (e.g. acute apical periodontitis, acute alveolar abscess, phoenix abscess). On the other hand in chronic inflammation bacteria remain confined in the endodontic space. Only few exceptions to this general rule have been experimentally proved. In endodontics we deal with a mixed infection which is composed by obligate anaerobes and by facultative anaerobes. The most frequently found obligate anaerobes are Bacteroides sp. and Fusobacterium sp. (Gram- rods) Anaerobic Diphtheroides (Gram+ rods) Peptostreptococcus sp. (Gram+ cocci) and Veilonella sp. (Gram- cocci). Actinomyces sp., Lactobacillus sp., Streptococcus sp., and Staphilococcus sp. are the facultative anaerobes most frequently found.
TI  - [A clinical study of asymptomatic bacteriospermia].
AB  - Asymptomatic bacteriospermia was studied as an entity and its treatment was investigated in 65 subjects who clinically needed their semen tested. The obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. The rate of detection of bacteria in semen was 89.2%, and the rates of detection of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were 55.4% and 70.8%, respectively. Forty Gram-positive strains were identified among the aerobic bacteria; rates of detection for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis were high, and 6 strains (9.2%) of Streptococcus agalactiae were also present. The rate of detection of Gram-negative bacteria was low; only 3 strains were identified. Among the anaerobic bacteria 90 Gram-positive strains were identified; the rate of detection of Peptostreptococcus (58 strains) was high, and only 11 strains of Gram-negative bacteria were present. 2. Among cefaclor (CCL), cephalexin, lomefloxacin, latamoxef and flomoxef (FMOX), FMOX was, in general, superior to the other drugs in terms of antibacterial activities against those strains isolated from semen. 3. Bacterial changes were observed in the semen specimens from 11 subjects who were subjected to oral administration of CCL (1,500 mg/days). After the treatment, 25 strains of bacteria disappeared but 7 strains remained among 32 strains that were present before treatment, and 23 strains appeared due to superinfection.
TI  - Microbiology of infected epidermal cysts.
AB  - Specimens from 231 epidermal cyst abscesses were inoculated on media supportive for growth of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Of these, 192 yielded bacterial growth. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were recovered in 84 specimens (44%), anaerobic bacteria only in 57 specimens (30%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 51 specimens (26%). A total of 315 isolates (162 anaerobes and 153 aerobes) were recovered. An average of 0.8 aerobic or facultative isolates per infected cyst were recovered, and this number was unrelated to the cysts' anatomic sites. However, the number of anaerobic bacteria varied; they were isolated more frequently in perirectal (1.5 isolates per specimen), vulvovaginal (1.4), and head (1.1) infections, and less frequently in trunk (0.7) and extremities (0.4) infections. The predominant aerobic or facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (81 isolates), group A streptococcus (9 isolates), and Escherichia coli (7 isolates). The predominant anaerobic organisms were Peptostreptococcus species (85 isolates) and Bacteroides species (55 isolates, including 12 Bacteroides melaninogenicus and 9 Bacteroides fragilis groups). The study highlights the polymicrobial nature and predominance of anaerobes in cyst abscesses in the perirectal, vulvovaginal, and head areas.
TI  - A 12 year study of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in intra-abdominal and postsurgical abdominal wound infections.
AB  - Findings from the study of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in intra-abdominal infections from 339 specimens of the peritoneal cavity after intestinal perforation, 83 specimens from abdominal abscesses and 89 specimens from postsurgical abdominal wounds are presented. Anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 43 (13 per cent) of the peritoneal specimens, aerobic bacteria alone in 38 (11 per cent) and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora in 258 (76 per cent). A total of 985 bacterial isolates were recovered in peritoneal specimens (2.9 per specimen), with 436 aerobes (1.3 per specimen) and 549 anaerobes (1.6 per specimen). Anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 13 (16 per cent) of 83 specimens from abdominal abscesses, aerobes alone in two (2 per cent) and mixed flora in 68 (82 per cent). A total of 235 bacterial isolates were recovered in abdominal abscesses--128 anaerobes (1.5 per specimen) and 107 aerobes (1.3 per specimen). Anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 11 (12 per cent) of 89 specimens from abdominal wounds, aerobic only in ten (11 per cent) and mixed flora in 68 (76 per cent). A total of 258 isolates were recovered (2.9 per specimen)--137 anaerobes (1.5 per specimen) and 121 aerobes or facultatives (1.4 per specimen). The predominant aerobes and facultatives in abdominal infections were Escherichia coli and Streptococcus species. The predominant anaerobes were Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus and Clostridium species. Recovered were 334 isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group--222 in peritoneal cultures, 63 in abscesses and 49 in wounds. Of the B. fragilis group, B. fragilis accounted for 129 (58 per cent) of isolates in peritoneal aspirates, 45 (75 per cent) in aspirates from abscesses and 30 (61 per cent) in wounds. Results from this study demonstrate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic cause and importance of all members of the B. fragilis group in intra-abdominal postsurgical infections.
TI  - Quantitative bacteriology of a case of acute parotitis.
AB  - It is generally assumed that the microorganisms responsible for acute suppurative parotitis are facultative anaerobes, primarily Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus viridans. A quantitative microbiologic investigation of an aspirate of pus from the case we report revealed a microbial flora (5.1 X 10(6) CFU/ml) consisting entirely of strict anaerobes (Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius). The strain of F. nucleatum was sensitive to metronidazole but resistant to penicillin, amoxicillin, and erythromycin (minimum inhibitory concentration greater than 16 micrograms/ml). P. anaerobius was sensitive to the antibiotics tested. It is concluded that a high concentration of viable anaerobic bacteria may be present in acute suppurative parotitis and thus pus obtained from cases of sialadenitis should be cultured with microbiologic methods capable of isolating strict anaerobes. Additionally, antibiotic sensitivity should be determined routinely.
TI  - Coaggregation of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Selenomonas flueggei, Selenomonas infelix, Selenomonas noxia, and Selenomonas sputigena with strains from 11 genera of oral bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-eight strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum and 41 Selenomonas strains, including S. sputigena (24 strains), S. flueggei (10 strains), S. infelix (5 strains), and S. noxia (2 strains), were tested for their ability to coaggregate with each other and with 49 other strains of oral bacteria representing Actinobacillus, Actinomyces, Bacteroides, Capnocytophaga, Gemella, Peptostreptococcus, Porphyromonas, Propionibacterium, Rothia, Streptococcus, and Veillonella species. Selenomonads coaggregated with fusobacteria and with Actinomyces naeslundii PK984 but not with any of the other bacteria, including other selenomonads. In contrast, fusobacteria coaggregated with members of all genera, although not with all strains of each species tested. Each fusobacterium strain appeared to have its own set of partners and coaggregation properties, unlike their partners, whose coaggregation properties in earlier surveys delineated distinct coaggregation groups. Coaggregations of fusobacteria with the 63 gram-negative strains were usually inhibited by EDTA, whereas those with the 27 gram-positive strains were usually not inhibited. Likewise, lactose-inhibitable coaggregations were common among some strains of fusobacteria and some strains from each of the genera containing gram-negative partners but were rarely observed with gram-positive partners. Heating the fusobacteria at 85 degrees C for 30 min completely prevented coaggregation with most partners, suggesting the involvement of a protein on the fusobacteria. Heat treatment of many of the gram-negative partners not only enhanced their coaggregation with the fusobacteria but also changed lactose-sensitive coaggregations to lactose-insensitive coaggregations. Although fusobacteria coaggregated with a broader variety of oral partner strains than any other group of oral bacteria tested to date, each fusobacterium exhibited coaggregation with only a certain set of partner strains, and none of the fusobacteria adhered to other strains of fusobacteria, indicating that recognition of partner cell surfaces is selective. The strains of F. nucleatum are heterogeneous and cannot be clustered into distinct coaggregation groups. Collectively, these results indicate that coaggregation between fusobacteria and many gram-negative partners is significantly different from their coaggregation with gram-positive partners. The contrasting variety of partners for fusobacteria and selenomonads supports the concept of coaggregation partner specificity that has been observed with every genus of oral bacteria so far examined.
TI  - [Studies on anaerobic infection in oro-maxillary region--rapid diagnosis by gas-liquid chromatography and antibiotic susceptibilities of anaerobic bacteria].
AB  - Subject material for this study was pus collected from patients with purulent inflammation in the oro-maxillary region. Direct gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) analysis was made, bacterial isolation and identification were carried out, and comparisons were made with results from GLC analysis and anaerobic isolates in a PYG medium. In addition, antibiotic susceptibilities of anaerobic bacteria were examined. Results 1. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 85 of 100 cases of obstructive abscesses. Of the 85, 49 were cases of mixed infection involving both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria; and 64 cases were involved with more than 2 species of anaerobic bacteria. Of the 184 strains of anaerobic isolates, 53 were Bacteroides sp. and 51 were Peptostreptococcus sp. The 2 groups accounted for more than half of the isolates. 2. Group A, in which no VFA was detected, accounted for 17 out of 100 cases. Group B, in which acetic acid was detected, accounted for 20 cases; and Group C, in which butyric acid was detected, accounted for 20 cases; and Group D, in which iso-valeric acid was detected, accounted for 8 cases. Direct GLC analysis revealed iso-caproic and caproic acids in the 35 cases constituting Group E. 3. Whereas the percentage of anaerobic bacteria was 64.7% in Group A and 60% in Group B, significantly higher percentages were noted in Group C (95%), Group D (100%) and Group E (100%). The following species were isolated as major member in the groups; Group A--Streptococcus intermedius, Group B--Peptostreptococcus micros, Group C--Fusobacterium nucleatum, Group D--Bacteroides gingivalis, and Group E--Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. 4. In all cases, the sum of VFA produced in the PYG medium by anaerobic isolates was classified into Group A' to E'. Ratios of agreement between VFA as revealed by direct GLC and VFA as revealed by PYG.GLC were as follows: Group A-A'; 47.1%, Group B-B' and C-C'; 45%, Group D-D'; 87.5%, and Group E-E'; 62.9%. 5. In Group B, no propionic acid was detected. The 2 cases in which acetic acid occurred in a concentration greater than 14 x 10(-4) meq/ml belonged to Group B'. In Group C, no isobutyric acid was detected; and the 5 cases in which butyric acid was detected in a concentration of more than 7 x 10(-4) meq/ml belonged to Group C'. Varelic acid was not detected in Group D; and 7 out of the 8 cases in which iso-valeric acid, irrespective of concentration, was detected belonged to Group D'.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity of the glycopeptide compounds vancomycin, teicoplanin and ramoplanin (A-16686/MDL 62,198).
AB  
TI  - Colony counts and characterization of bacteria adherent to the rumen wall and desquamated epithelial cells in conventional young lambs.
AB  - Characterization and enumeration of the adherent epimural community of the rumen  wall of young, conventionally reared lambs were carried out from 2 to 21 days after birth. Three hundred strains were isolated by anaerobic procedures from three sites: dorsal, ventral, and caudal sacs, and from the sloughed epithelial cells. The population of epimural bacteria was very dense from the first days of the lamb's life. This population increased slightly with age. During the first week the counts were similar in the dorsal and ventral sacs, but they were 10 to 100 times lower in the caudal sac. Total counts for anaerobic bacteria were higher than the counts for aerobic bacteria. The isolated strains were distributed into 19 groups: 11 groups included aerotolerant strains, and 8 others, strictly anaerobic strains. During the first week the facultative microflora was mainly composed of Escherichia coli and Streptococci. Later, the epimural community was more complex and included Staphyloccus, Micrococcus, and Gaffkya. The strictly anaerobic microflora was mainly composed of Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, Veillonella, Propionibacterium, and Acidaminococcus. Some of these strains appeared to be similar to those previously isolated from the rumen fluid of young lambs; however, the genera Micrococcus, Veillonella, Gaffkya, and Acidaminococcus, and E. coli seemed to be specific of the rumen wall tissues.
TI  - Intravenous sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of pediatric infections.
AB  - A total of 82 patients involving 83 episodes of proven or presumed bacterial infection were treated with sulbactam/ampicillin. These included 36 cases of soft tissue infection or abscess, four cases of joint or bone infection, 20 cases of respiratory tract infection (17 cases of pneumonia, two of otitis media, and one of tonsillitis), 15 urinary tract infections, three cases of enterocolitis, one case of infective endocarditis, two cases of septicemia, and two of peritonitis. The causative pathogen was isolated in 48 cases (49 infections). These pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus 13 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis one, Streptococcus pyogenes two, Streptococcus pneumoniae two, Viridans group streptococcus two, peptostreptococcus one, Haemophilus influenzae one, Escherichia coli 12, Enterobacter cloacae three, Proteus mirabilis one, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus one, Salmonella spp. two, Shigella sonnei one, Bacteroides fragilis one, and polymicrobial infections of various combinations in five cases. No bacterial pathogens were isolated in 34 infections, 14 cases of pneumonia and 15 soft tissue infections. Sulbactam/ampicillin was given by intravenous bolus in a dosage range of 75-450 mg/kg/day in four divided doses for variable periods of time depending on the type and severity of the infection. Of a total of 83 episodes of infections, 80 (96.4%) cases were either cured or improved. Bacteriologic eradication also occurred in 46 (93.9%) of 49 infections. Side effects were diarrhea in two patients, acute hemolytic anemia in one patient, and transient elevations in SGOT and leukopenia in one patient. Side effects disappeared upon completion of treatment. Sulbactam/ampicillin is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of common pediatric infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  - Lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. In this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated antimicrobials. Lomefloxacin was very active against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (MIC90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). In common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of Neisseria spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Legionella spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Vibrio spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC90, 1 microgram/ml). Lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of Bacteroides spp. (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml) or Clostridium difficile MIC90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of Clostridium perfringens (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), Peptostreptococcus spp. (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), Chlamydia trachomatis (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), Mycoplasma hominis (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), and Urea-plasma urealyticum (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the MIC with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of Escherichia coli and S. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the MIC. These results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by S. aureus.
TI  - Coumamidines, new broad spectrum antibiotics of the cinodine type. III. Microbiologic activity of coumamidine gamma 1.
AB  - The coumamidines are novel antibiotics with activity against a wide spectrum of aerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. All microbiological studies were performed on coumamidine gamma 1. The MIC90s (micrograms/ml) of coumamidine are as follows: Staphylococcus aureus 1.0, Streptococcus pyogenes 8, Enterobacteriaceae 2.0, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 8, Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli 1, Legionella pneumophila 8, Haemophilus influenzae 0.5, Neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.5. Coumamidine had MICs ranging from 8 to greater 0.5, Neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.5. Coumamidine had MICs ranging from 8 to greater than 64 for most anaerobes, except some Peptostreptococcus strains. The aminoglycoside super-sensitive strain, P. aeruginosa BMH 10, was also super-sensitive to coumamidine (MIC 0.2 micrograms/ml). Coumamidine was rapidly bactericidal for S. aureus. The viable bacterial count in logarithmic phase cultures was reduced to less than 10 cfu within 2 hours after exposure to 4 times the MIC (3.12 micrograms/ml) of coumamidine. The frequency of resistance development was less than 1 X 10(-9) for Escherichia coli and S. aureus when selected at 4 and 8 times the MIC. The Cmax in mouse serum after a single subcutaneous dose of 25 mg/kg of coumamidine was 4.5 micrograms/ml and t1/2 was 1 hour. Coumamidine is stable in serum. In mouse protection tests against S. aureus NCTC 10649 the ED50 was less than 0.6 mg/kg/day when it was administered subcutaneously at 1 and 5 hours after infection. Coumamidine was not absorbed after oral administration. The antibacterial spectrum, bactericidal activity, stability in serum and low frequency of resistance make this an interesting new class of antibiotics.
TI  - In-vitro activity of a new penem FCE 22101.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of a new penem FCE 22101 was evaluated in comparison with other antimicrobial agents against 966 aerobic and anaerobic Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. FCE 22101 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, H. ducreyi, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis and group B streptococcus at concentrations of 0.12-4.0 mg/l. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant with MIC90 of greater than 32 mg/l. Streptococcus faecalis displayed MIC90 of 16 mg/l. Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium spp., Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. were inhibited at concentrations of 0.25-2.0 mg/l. beta-Lactamase-producing or methicillin resistant bacteria did not have significantly elevated MICs. FCE 22101 was generally less active than imipenem but more active than other beta-lactam antibiotics examined.
TI  - The predominant cultivable microbiota of crevicular epithelial cells.
AB  - The purpose of the present investigation was to compare the composition of the predominant cultivable microbiota associated with gingival crevicular epithelial cells with that of the unattached microbiota recovered from the same site. Samples were taken from 2 diseased sites from 8 periodontal patients, by scraping the epithelial lining of the pocket with a curette. The epithelial cells were separated from the unattached subgingival bacteria by centrifugation in a reduced 50% Percoll density gradient. Epithelial cells formed a band at the top of the gradient and were removed separately from the unattached bacteria located at the base. Each layer was dispersed, diluted and plated on Trypticase soy agar with 5% sheep blood and 50 isolates were characterized from each sample. The microorganisms associated with the epithelial layer harbored 5- to 20-fold higher mean percentages of Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius and Peptostreptococcus micros. The layer of unattached organisms exhibited 4- to 10-fold higher mean percentages of Streptococcus uberis, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Eikenella corrodens and Veillonella parvula.
TI  - Bacterial flora in chronic tonsillitis.
AB  - A study of aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in chronic tonsillitis revealed  a total of 59 isolates. Aerobic flora from the surface swab was found in 80%, from the core of the tonsil in 92% and from both the surface and the core in 68% of the cases. There were 30 aerobic isolates from the surface and 29 isolates from the core. Mixed flora were present from the surface and the core in 10 and 7 cases, respectively. Pathogens were seen in 36% of the cases from the surface and in 40% from the core. There was no significant difference in the nature of aerobic flora from the two sites. Anaerobic flora were cultured from the core only and were seen in 20% of cases. There were a total of 7 isolates. In 16% cases it was associated with aerobic flora. The common aerobes were Beta hemolytic streptococcus (16%) and Staphylococcus coagulase positive (12%) and common anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus (16%) and Veillonella parvula (4%). There was no consistent pattern of combination of aerobes and anaerobes in chronic tonsillitis.
TI  - An in vitro method to study the adherence of oral bacteria to HeLa cells.
AB  - Exfoliated buccal epithelial cells have been widely used in microbial adherence studies, but present a number of problems due to their variable nature and to contamination with indigenous bacteria. An adherence assay was developed using HeLa cell monolayers which were washed with buffer, or treated with saliva or serum to mimic buccal or crevicular epithelial cells, respectively. A total of eighteen strains of oral bacteria tested showed a low affinity for untreated HeLa cells, but most strains adhered in high numbers to saliva treated HeLa cells. A few strains, usually present in the gingival crevice, demonstrated a high affinity for serum treated HeLa cells. Thus, salivary and crevicular fluid components appear to be specifically implicated in the selective adherence and colonization of bacteria on oral surfaces.
TI  - Josamycin concentrations in human dental granuloma after a single oral administration of josamycin.
AB  - 1. Josamycin concentrations in human serum and dental granuloma after a single oral administration of josamycin (600 mg) were assayed by an agar diffusion (paper disc) method. 2. The mean peak josamycin concentrations in serum and dental granuloma occurred at an identical time, approximately 90 min, and were 0.88 micrograms/ml and 1.61 micrograms/g, respectively. 3. The mean concentration ratio of dental granuloma to serum at the peak time was 2.24. 4. Josamycin concentration in dental granuloma at the peak time exceeded MIC80 for clinically isolated strains of Streptococcus group A, Peptostreptococcus spp., and Bacteroides spp.
TI  - Fermentation of peptides and amino acids by a monensin-sensitive ruminal Peptostreptococcus.
AB  - A monensin-sensitive ruminal peptostreptococcus was able to grow rapidly (growth  rate of 0.5/h) on an enzymatic hydrolysate of casein, but less than 23% of the amino acid nitrogen was ever utilized. When an acid hydrolysate was substituted for the enzymatic digest, more than 31% of the nitrogen was converted to ammonia and cell protein. Coculture experiments and synergisms with peptide-degrading strains of Bacteroides ruminicola and Streptococcus bovis indicated that the peptostreptococcus was unable to transport certain peptides or hydrolyze them extracellularly. Leucine, serine, phenylalanine, threonine, and glutamine were deaminated at rates of 349, 258, 102, 95, and 91 nmol/mg of protein per min, respectively. Deamination rates for some other amino acids were increased when the amino acids were provided as pairs of oxidized and reduced amino acids (Stickland reactions), but these rates were still less than 80 nmol/mg of protein per min. In continuous culture (dilution rate of 0.1/h), bacterial dry matter and ammonia production decreased dramatically at a pH of less than 6.0. When dilution rates were increased from 0.08 to 0.32/h (pH 7.0), ammonia production increased while production of bacterial dry matter and protein decreased. These rather peculiar kinetics resulted in a slightly negative estimate of maintenance energy and could not be explained by a change in fermentation products. Approximately 80% of the cell dry matter was protein. When corrections were made for cell composition, the yield of ATP was higher than the theoretical maximum value. It is possible that mechanisms other than substrate-level phosphorylation contributed to the energetics of growth.
TI  - Preformed enzyme profiles of reference strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci.
AB  - The preformed (constitutive) enzyme profiles of 30 type strains and reference strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci were determined with two commercial systems, RapID ANA and a prototype system from API. Both systems identified Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Ps. asaccharolyticus, Ps. indolicus, Ps. magnus and Ps. micros accurately, except for one strain of Ps. magnus misidentified as Ps. micros by the RapID ANA system. The indole-negative, butyrate-producing cocci (classified at present as Ps. prevotii and Ps. tetradius) produced several different, unique patterns with the prototype API system, but the results with RapID ANA were often misleading. Eight strains of Hare group cocci produced previously described profiles. Four strains of streptococci produced profiles easily distinguished from those of the gram-positive anaerobic cocci. We conclude that most gram-positive anaerobic cocci can be identified rapidly and reliably to the species level by their preformed enzyme profiles, providing that their underlying classification is sound. Problems were encountered with the butyrate-producing cocci, which appear to be a more heterogeneous group of organisms than is currently acknowledged; further taxonomic studies on these organisms are required.
TI  - Presentation and management of neck abscess: a retrospective analysis.
AB  - A retrospective analysis of deep neck abscesses managed at the Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center was performed. Fifty-one patients met the criteria and were reviewed as to presentation, etiology, location, and microbiology. Hemolytic streptococci and anaerobic species, especially Bacteroides and peptostreptococci, were the most common organisms isolated. Intravenous drug abuse was the most common etiology, and was an important source of primary carotid space infection. This group was most commonly infected with Streptococcus species (50%).
TI  - A multicenter comparative study of cefotetan once daily and cefoxitin thrice daily for the treatment of infections of the skin and superficial soft tissue.
AB  - To compare the effectiveness of cefotetan administered at 2 g once a day with cefoxitin at 1 or 2 g three times a day in the treatment of hospitalized patients with skin and superficial soft tissue infections, 194 patients from eight centers were enrolled in an open, randomized trial. Most of the 104 evaluable patients in the cefotetan group and 50 in the cefoxitin group were young men with community-acquired, moderate or severe cellulitis, or abscesses of the upper and lower extremities caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Bacteroides fragilis and other species of bacteroides, peptococcus species, and peptostreptococcus species. The mean duration of treatment was 7.5 days for cefotetan and 7.1 days for cefoxitin. A successful clinical response was achieved in 97 percent of the cefotetan patients and in 94 percent of the cefoxitin patients. Of the 88 and 39 bacteriologically evaluable patients in the cefotetan and cefoxitin groups, respectively, a satisfactory bacteriologic response occurred in 96 percent and 87 percent of the patients. No clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory determinations were noted. The incidence of adverse reactions in the cefotetan group (17 percent) was significantly different from that for the cefoxitin group (6 percent) (p less than 0.05); however, the incidence of treatment-related reactions was not significant and the events were mild. Discontinuation of therapy was necessary only in two patients in whom allergic-type reactions developed. A once-daily regimen of cefotetan was as effective as thrice-daily cefoxitin in this study in the treatment of primarily polymicrobial, moderate, or severe infections of the skin and superficial soft tissue.
TI  - Cecal and fecal bacterial flora of the Mongolian gerbil and the chinchilla.
AB  - The Mongolian gerbil is being increasingly used as a laboratory animal and as a pet. Both chinchillas and gerbils are used as animal models for otitis media and other otic research. Previously, only incomplete information was available regarding the indigenous bacterial flora of the lower intestinal tracts of these coprophagic animals. Using the strict anaerobic methodology of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute Anaerobe Laboratory, we studied the predominant bacterial flora of the cecum and fecal pellets of the gerbil and the chinchilla and the bacterial flora of digesta pellets in the proximal colon. We found species of the following anaerobic genera in high dilutions of gerbil fecal pellets: Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Propionibacterium, Lactobacillus, and Bacteroides. Only lactobacilli were found in high dilutions of digesta from the upper colon, although the cecum yielded Peptostreptococcus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Lactobacillus, Propionibacterium, and Bacteroides species from high dilutions of cecal contents. The facultatively anaerobic and aerobic flora isolated consisted of species of Bacillus, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Acinetobacter, Alcaligenes, Escherichia, Pasteurella, and Pseudomonas plus several unidentifiable organisms. Species of Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Eubacterium, and anaerobic Lactobacillus were isolated from chinchillas.
TI  - Semiquantitative culture results and pathogenic significance of obligate anaerobes in peritonsillar abscesses.
AB  - We studied the bacteria in consecutive peritonsillar abscesses using semiquantitation of the primary culture findings and correlated the results to clinical parameters. Puncture-aspirated pus from 42 abscesses yielded 133 isolates. Group A streptococci were isolated 10 times and, unlike other bacteria, were isolated 4 times in pure culture; other beta-hemolytic streptococci were found in 8 abscesses, and anaerobes were found in 28. The infections were polymicrobial, with two to seven bacteria in 83%. Anaerobes were more abundant than nonanaerobes; members of the genera Streptococcus, Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, and Fusobacterium were the most important quantitatively, considering both frequency and abundance. In patients with ongoing antibiotic treatment, nonanaerobes (but not anaerobes) were less abundant than in untreated patients. The abundance of obligate anaerobes (specifically cocci and gram-positive rods) correlated to the severity of illness as defined by fever and short duration before hospitalization. With other groups of bacteria, no such correlation was found. The correlation was not explained by a difference between the antibiotic-treated and the untreated patients. The results indicate the value of the semiquantitation of culture data and the frequency and pathogenic significance of obligate anaerobes in peritonsillar abscesses.
TI  - Peptostreptococcus micros in polymicrobial abscesses.
AB  
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of purulent nasopharyngitis in children.
AB  - Cultures of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were obtained from the inferior nasal  meatus of 25 children with purulent nasopharyngitis and from 25 controls. Microorganisms were isolated from all specimens. A total of 98 isolates (3.9 per patient), 45 aerobes (1.8 per patient) and 53 anaerobes (2.1 per patient), were isolated in patients with purulent nasopharyngitis. Seventy-three isolates (2.9 per patient), 47 aerobes (1.9 per patient) and 26 anaerobes (1.0 per patient) were found in the controls. The organisms recovered in statistically significantly higher numbers in patients with nasopharyngitis were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus sp., Peptostreptococcus spp., Fusobacterium spp., and Bacteroides spp. The organisms recovered in significantly higher numbers in controls were Staphylococcus aureus and Propionibacterium acnes. beta-Lactamase activity was detected in 19 isolates recovered from 15 individuals (9 patients and 6 controls). These findings demonstrate the aerobic-anaerobic polymicrobial flora associated with purulent nasopharyngitis. Further studies are indicated to evaluate the pathogenic role of these organisms in this condition.
TI  - [Studies on antimicrobial concentrations of flomoxef in serum, pelvic dead space  exudate, and pelvic organs/tissues].
AB  - To women undergoing radical and total hysterectomy, flomoxef (FMOX, 6315-S) in a  dose of 2 g was administered by intravenous drip infusion over 1 hour and drug concentrations in serum and pelvic dead space exudate as well as pelvic organs/tissues were determined over time. The following results were obtained: 1. Serum concentrations of FMOX after intravenous infusion showed the peak value of 92.86 +/- 17.05 micrograms/ml at the end of infusion and then gradually decreased to 29.00 +/- 10.49 micrograms/ml in 1 hour and 1.16 +/- 1.08 micrograms/ml in 6 hours. 2. Concentrations in pelvic dead space exudate, which were 6.54 +/- 3.21 micrograms/ml at the end of intravenous infusion, gradually increased to 31.28 +/- 12.69 micrograms/ml in 30 minutes, and the peak of 35.21 +/- 13.29 micrograms/ml in 1 hour. Exudate concentrations gradually decreased to 11.10 +/- 6.64 micrograms/ml at 6 hours after infusion. 3. The serum concentration at the ligature of uterine artery was 103.21 +/- 51.69 micrograms/ml. Among concentrations in pelvic organ/tissues 37.17 +/- 18.20 micrograms/ml in uterine cervix was the highest, followed by 35.77 +/- 7.68 micrograms/g in portio vaginalis, 26.35 +/- 14.15 micrograms/g in tube, 21.62 +/- 12.15 micrograms/g in ovary, 20.56 +/- 9.82 micrograms/g in myometrium, and 16.45 +/- 8.10 micrograms/g in endometrium, in this order. 4. From an analysis of the two-compartment model, the maximum serum concentration was 92.81 micrograms/ml, which was very high. The time of 50% reduction of concentration in beta phase was 1.21 hours. In the pelvic dead space exudate, the maximum concentration was 32.38 micrograms/ml and the time of 50% reduction was 2.44 hours. The AUC was 147 micrograms.hr/ml in serum and 201 micrograms.hr/ml in the pelvic dead space. The shift to the pelvic dead space was 137% when AUC's were used as the basis of the comparison. 5. Clinically, FMOX was excellently effective against adnexitis caused by Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, intrauterine infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus, cystitis caused by Klebsiella and Escherichia coli, vaginal stump infection caused by Streptococcus and E. coli and many other infections.
TI  - Bacteria in bile of patients with bile duct inflammation.
AB  - Bile samples taken intraoperatively from 100 patients with three different bile system diseases were subjected to bacteriological analysis. Statistically significant differences between the types of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria present in the bile were found.
TI  - Effect of high-fiber and high-oil diets on the fecal flora of swine.
AB  - Six pairs of pigs were fed a basal diet, a high-fiber diet, and a diet high in corn oil in different sequences to minimize the carry-over effect of diet. After 2 months on each diet, a fecal specimen from each pig was cultured on nonselective medium in roll tubes. Fifty colonies were randomly selected from each fecal sample, and isolates were characterized to identify a representative cross section of the fecal flora. The bacterial composition of the fecal flora differed between basal and high-fiber diets (P = 0.002) and between high-fiber and high-oil diets (P = 0.015). However, the floras were not significantly different between the basal and the high-oil diets (P = 0.135), nor were the floras of the 12 individual pigs (each on all three diets) statistically different (P = 0.103). Only 14 of the 160 observed taxa have been detected in the human fecal flora, and only 159 of 1,871 total isolates (8.5%) were members of described species. The most common isolate was a Streptococcus species similar to that reported by Robinson et al. (I. M. Robinson, S. C. Whipp, J. A. Bucklin, and M. J. Allison, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 48:964-969, 1984), which was found in 34 of 36 samples and which represented 27.5% of all isolates. Lactobacillus, Fusobacterium, Eubacterium, Bacteroides, and Peptostreptococcus species were the next most common bacteria. Escherichia coli represented 1.7% of all fecal isolates, which is somewhat higher than the 0.1 to 0.6% observed in human feces cultured similarly with prereduced anaerobically sterilized media.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The growth of oral bacteria on saliva.
AB  - The present experiments were aimed at studying the degradation of salivary glycoproteins by the oral microflora. To this end, S. sanguis I strain Ny476 and S. sanguis II (S. mitior) strain Ny581 were grown continuously in human-whole saliva. Under these conditions, the strains produced a variety of cell-associated hydrolytic activities, including glycosidases, exo- and endopeptidases, and esterases. S. sanguis II generally exhibited higher levels of enzyme activity than did S. sanguis I, in particular of neuraminidase that was produced only by S. sanguis II. In accordance, S. sanguis II had a higher cell yield and consumed a higher proportion of the sugars and sialic acid in the glycoproteins than did S. sanguis I. Interestingly, S. sanguis I, which is devoid of neuraminidase, is known to have a lectin with specificity for sialic acid, whereas S. sanguis II has affinity for galactose residues in the glycoproteins. We propose that specific binding of glycoproteins by oral bacteria constitutes a mechanism to collect nutrients in the vicinity of the cell. The special ability of S. sanguis II to utilize saliva for growth was further exemplified by its selection in batch-wise enrichments of dental plaque on saliva. The microflora in these enrichment cultures always consisted of Peptostreptococcus micros, S. sanguis II, and Fusobacterium nucleatum as the dominant organisms. Further, S. mitis and Gemella haemolysans were generally found to be present. The enrichment cultures produced a wide variety of mainly cell-bound hydrolytic enzymes. This resulted in almost complete breakdown of salivary glycoproteins in the culture.
TI  - Severe infections of the head and neck resulting from gas-forming organisms: report of case.
AB  - A case of severe infection of the head and neck associated with gas-forming organisms in a patient with fractures of the mandible is presented. Selected aspects of antibiotic therapy are discussed.
TI  - Effect of Streptococcus parvulus and Peptostreptococcus magnus on cytotoxin levels of Clostridium difficile in anaerobic continuous flow culture.
AB  - An anaerobic continuous flow (CF) culture method was used in order to study the effect of Peptostreptococcus magnus and Streptococcus parvulus, anaerobic gram-positive cocci which are members of intestinal bacterial flora, on growth and cytotoxin-activity of Clostridium difficile. The growth- and the cytotoxin activity-patterns of C. difficile in an established CF culture of P. magnus were similar to those of C. difficile alone. On the other hand, in the mixed culture system of C. difficile and S. parvulus, the cytotoxin levels were significantly lower as compared with C. difficile alone in spite of the fact that no differences existed between growth of C. difficile in mixed and single culture systems. The culture filtrate of P. magnus did not influence the growth and cytotoxin production of C. difficile, nor did that of S. parvulus have any effect on growth of C. difficile in static culture. The cytotoxin activity of C. difficile was, however, suppressed by the culture filtrate of S. parvulus. Furthermore, when P. magnus or S. parvulus was statically cultured in a medium containing cytotoxic culture filtrate of C. difficile, the toxin in the medium was not inactivated.
TI  - [Bacterial infection agents in hospitalized patients].
AB  - During six months the pattern of microbial isolates has been analysed from 1492 urinary tract infections, from 1445 wound infections, from 451 bronchial secretions, from 3067 blood cultures, from 116 peritoneal swabs and from 39 cerebrospinal fluids. All the specimens investigated were taken from patients of surgical, neurosurgical, internal wards and two intensive care units. In total, the most frequent isolates were grampositive microorganisms like Staphylococus aureus, Straphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus sp. of different serotypes. Out of the Enterobacteriaceae Escherichia coli and Klebisella pneumoniae predominated followed by Enterobacter cloacae and indolnegative and -positive Proteus species. The over all isolation rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in nosocomial infections was about 10%. In the last time Pseudomonas maltophilia will be isolated more frequently as well as occasional Streptococcus faecium and Corynebacterium JK. Dependent from the site of infection anaerobic bacteria like Bacteroides sp., Peptococcus- and Peptostreptococcus sp. are really important in the infectious diseases. The epidemiological data should be always transmitted to the infection control board. From there preventive measures must be induced.
TI  - Pathogenicity of Clostridium species with other bacteria in mixed infections.
AB  - The relationship of clostridial isolates with other bacteria in mixed infections  was studied by means of a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. We used 26 isolates of seven clostridial species, two Bacteroides spp., eight Gram-positive facultative or anaerobic cocci and three enteric Gram-negative aerobic rods. Abscesses were induced by all seven Clostridium perfringens and three C. butyricum isolates and by some of the others. Selective antimicrobial therapy experiments showed that enteric Gram-negative rods were of equal or greater significance in the formation of abscesses than were clostridial strains in mixed infections. Enhancement or suppression of each component of the mixed infection was studied by comparing the number of each bacterium to its number when injected alone. Enhancement was observed mainly with C. perfringens in mixed infections. By contrast, other Clostridium spp. were less able to induce enhancement. Clostridium difficile and C. sporogenes often inhibited other bacterial species. This study demonstrated the synergistic and antagonistic relationship between clostridial species and other bacteria.
TI  - The significance of clostridial isolates in intra-abdominal sepsis.
AB  - In order to evaluate the significance of clostridial species in intra-abdominal infections, the bacteriology records of three hospitals were reviewed during a period of five years. Included in this report were 41 patients from whom clostridial species were recovered from specimens of free peritoneal fluid, abscess cavities or bile. Seven patients died for a mortality rate of 17.1 per cent. Most patients had polymicrobial infections of which clostridial organisms were one of the several anaerobes isolated. Clostridium perfringens was the single most frequently noted species, identified in 23 of the patients, but it was not associated with a different mortality rate than was observed for the other clostridial species. Clostridial bacteremia was uncommon and demonstrated in only one patient. The mean age of the patients was 56.4 years; 56.2 for males and 56.8 for females. Neither age nor sex of the patient influenced the likelihood of survival. The source of the clostridial isolates--bile, abscess cavity or free peritoneal fluid--had no effect upon the outcome. Several underlying conditions were responsible for the intraperitoneal clostridial organisms identified in this series. Only mesenteric infarction proved significantly predictive of a fatal result. Antibiotic coverage specifically directed against clostridia did not influence survival.
TI  - In vitro activity of flurithromycin, a novel macrolide antibiotic.
AB  - Flurithromycin is an (8,S)-8-fluoroerythromycin isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces erythraeus ATCC 31772, a blocked mutant of a strain producer of erythromycin. Its in vitro antibacterial activity has been determined on recent clinical isolates of respiratory pathogens. The range of MIC for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus group A is from 0.0015 to 0.006 microgram/ml, for Haemophilus influenzae from 0.012 to 0.4 microgram/ml, for Staphylococcus aureus from 0.1 to 3.1 micrograms/ml. Its action is bacteriostatic and increases at alkaline pH. Among anaerobes Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, other species of Bacteroides and Peptostreptococcus are particularly susceptible. Flurithromycin also showed some activity on Mycobacterium bovis, M. scrofulaceum and M. phley. The determination of killing curves indicated that in most cases a killing effect was obtained at 4 X MIC. A combination of flurithromycin with ampicillin or doxycycline sometimes was synergic, but more often additive and never antagonistic. The possible interference of flurithromycin on some parameters of the natural system of defense was determined. At concentrations equal to therapeutic levels in blood and tissues, flurithromycin did not influence chemotaxis, phagocytosis, metabolic activation and the killing activity of neutrophils.
TI  - Arthropathic properties of cell wall polymers from normal flora bacteria.
AB  - Peptidoglycan-polysaccharide (PG-PS) fragments were purified from cell walls of group D streptococci (Streptococcus faecium, strains ATCC 9790 and F-24) with a protocol which minimizes autolytic activity and tested for ability to induce arthritis in rats. PG-PS fragments from cell walls of other normal flora bacteria (Peptostreptococcus productus, and Propionibacterium acnes), group A streptococci, and pseudomurein-PS fragments from cell walls of Methanobacterium formicicum, were similarly purified and tested. Upon intraarticular injection into rat ankles, all PG-PS polymers induced acute inflammation; pseudomurein-PS fragments were approximately five times less active than the PG-PS preparations. After intraperitoneal injection, P. acnes PG-PS induced a minimal acute arthritis, Peptostreptococcus productus PG-PS induced a moderately severe acute joint inflammation followed by a mild chronic arthritis, and both group A and group D streptococcal PG-PS induced severe acute arthritis which evolved into chronic, erosive joint disease; pseudomurein-PS fragments were without effect, consistent with a crucial role for the PG moiety of PG-PS. Chronic arthritis induced by group D streptococcal PG-PS subsided after 60 days, whereas that induced by group A streptococcal PG-PS was still active after 128 days. The arthropathic properties of this modest number of common normal flora bacteria suggest that different PG-PS structures derived from the normal flora have the potential to induce a wide range of responses, from transient acute to chronic erosive joint disease.
TI  - Gastric acidity: an important factor regulating the composition of the bacterial  flora in the small intestine.
AB  - The role of gastric acidity in regulating the bacterium composition in the small  intestine was studied. Gastric acidity was determined with the Kay test. Intestinal juice obtained by a probe was examined for the presence and number of microorganisms. Parallel with the increase in gastric acidity, the number of bacteria in the jejunal juice generally decreased. Their composition also varied: in anacid patients E. coli predominated whereas in those with free hydrochloric acid, Streptococcus alpha haemolyticus and anaerobic Peptostreptococcus formed the bulk of the microflora. These data underline the importance of the role of acidity in the development of bacterial contamination in the jejunum.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibilities of periodontal bacteria. In vitro susceptibilities to eight antimicrobial agents.
AB  - In vitro susceptibilities of 369 to 966 bacterial isolates from periodontal lesions to eight antibiotics were determined by agar dilution technique as a means of determining which antimicrobial agents were inhibitory for bacteria frequently associated with destructive periodontal diseases. Although most bacteria were relatively susceptible to the penicillins, greater activity was generally noted with amoxicillin than with either penicillin or ampicillin with the exception of Selenomonas sputigena and Peptostreptococcus. Antibacterial activities obtained with minocycline were significantly higher than with tetracycline for Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Streptococcus but comparable for most other taxa. Clindamycin and metronidazole both demonstrated excellent activity against the anaerobic Gram-negative rods but were less effective against some of the capnophilic and facultative organisms. Eikenella corrodens was exceptionally resistant to both of these drugs; and A. actinomycetemcomitans was generally resistant to clindamycin but relatively susceptible to metronidazole. Erythromycin was considerably less active than the other antibiotics against the majority of the periodontal bacteria. No single antibiotic, at concentrations equivalent to those achieved in body fluids, was uniformly effective in inhibiting all bacteria currently implicated or suspected as etiologic agents of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Predominant obligate anaerobes in human carious dentin.
AB  - With the adoption of an anaerobic glove box system, we isolated and identified the predominant micro-organisms in lesions of carious dentin from four permanent third molars. The overwhelming majority of the micro-organisms isolated from both shallow and deep layers of carious dentin were obligate anaerobes, suggesting that conditions in the dentin were strictly anaerobic. The predominant obligate anaerobes were Gram-positive rods which were identified as members of the following genera: Propionibacterium, Eubacterium, Arachnia, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Actinomyces. Clostridia, Gram-negative rods (Bacteroides and Fusobacterium) and Gram-positive cocci (Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, and Streptococcus) were also isolated, although they constituted a minor part of the flora.
TI  - Survival analysis of periodontal sites before and after periodontal therapy.
AB  - Periodontal diseases appear to progress with bursts of destructive activity at individual sites. One effect of treatment might be to diminish the frequency of such bursts. Survival analysis was employed to seek such effects on the periodontal sites of 16 individuals with prior evidence of destructive periodontal disease. The subjects were monitored at bi-monthly intervals and actively breaking down sites were detected using attachment level measurements and the tolerance method of analysis. When active sites were detected, control sites of equal pocket depth and attachment loss were selected and microbiological and immunological samples were taken. The subjects were treated by modified Widman flap surgery and systemically administered tetracycline. On completion of therapy, bi-monthly monitoring was reinstituted. Life tables were constructed for periodontal sites in each of the 16 subjects prior to and after therapy. A site losing more than 3 mm of attachment at any time interval was considered to have relapsed or "died". Survivor functions were calculated for each time period indicating the % of sites which survived at any time. The subjects were divided into 3 categories on the basis of post-therapy survivor functions. The annual hazard rate in 9 good treatment response subjects (group 1) was reduced from 0.10/year to 0.01/year. The hazard rate of 5 intermediate treatment response subjects (group 2A) was reduced from 0.16/year to 0.04/year and that of 2 poor treatment response subjects (group 2B) from 0.15/year to 0.07/year. Group 2A and 2B individuals were combined and differences were sought in clinical, microbiological and immunological parameters between the good and poor treatment response groups. 5 out of 7 of the poor responding individuals showed elevated humoral antibody responses to 3 or more gram-negative subgingival species tested. Many of the elevated responses in this group were to organisms which are widely distributed and return quickly after therapy such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens, Bacteroides intermedius and Capnocytophaga sputigena. The predominant cultivable microbiota in subgingival samples taken prior to therapy from the good responding group had significantly greater proportions of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, C. ochracea and B. intermedius than the poor responding group. The latter group showed significantly elevated proportions of F. nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros and Streptococcus intermedius.
TI  - Comparative clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin vs. cefotaxime in treatment of severe bacterial infections.
AB  - Adult patients with severe bacterial infections caused by organisms susceptible to imipenem and cefotaxime were given either imipenem/cilastatin sodium (MK0787/MK0791) or cefotaxime as a part of a multiclinic randomized study to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of imipenem/cilastatin. Clinical diagnoses included bacteremia, urinary tract infection, osteomyelitis, mediastinitis, lower respiratory tract infection, and soft tissue infection. Efficacy was evaluated for 10 patients given imipenem/cilastatin and for 10 patients given cefotaxime. Major pathogens isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus species. Satisfactory clinical responses were noted in 90% of the patients in both treatment groups. Eradication of the pathogen was achieved in nine of 10 patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin and in 10 of 10 patients treated with cefotaxime. No major adverse effects were found in patients in each treatment group. The results of this study suggest that imipenem/cilastatin sodium is a relatively safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of adult patients with severe infections caused by susceptible organisms.
TI  - In vitro effects of sulphasalazine, azodisal sodium, and their metabolites on Clostridium difficile and some other faecal bacteria.
AB  - The effects of sulphasalazine (SASP), azodisal sodium (ADS), and their metabolites were tested in vitro on aerobic and anaerobic faecal bacterial strains. Sulphapyridine (SP) had a mild to moderate effect on Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis. SASP also had a growth-inhibitory effect on Strep. faecalis. The other substances had no effect on the aerobic strains. SASP, SP, 5-aminosalicylic acid, and, to a certain extent, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid exerted a growth-inhibitory effect on the anaerobic strains. Of special interest was the inhibitory effect on Clostridium difficile strains. In recent years the possibility that overgrowth of Cl. difficile could cause flare-ups of inflammatory bowel disease has been discussed. Some studies suggested that SASP treatment could predispose to Cl. difficile superinfection, whereas others found SASP more probable to exert a prophylactic effect. Our findings support the theory that SASP treatment reduces rather than promotes the risk of Cl. difficile superinfection.
TI  - Peritonsillar abscess: bacteriological evaluation.
AB  - The pus from a series of 41 peritonsillar abscesses was examined bacteriologically. In the majority of the abscesses a mixed bacterial flora was found. The specimens yielded 0-7 different bacterial species per abscess (mean 3.0). One species alone was isolated only in five cases (12.5%). Both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria were isolated from the specimens of 25 patients (61%), only anaerobes from two specimens (4.9%), and only facultative bacteria from 12 specimens (29%). Beta haemolytic streptococci were cultured in 43.9% of the cases, but Streptococcus pyogenes group A in only 10 cases (24.4%). Thus, the pus of the peritonsillar abscess seems to be caused by a mixed bacterial infection, where anaerobic bacteria play a significant role. Indications of tonsillectomy in cases with peritonsillar abscess are discussed.
TI  - Respiratory infections: clinical evaluation.
AB  - A review of clinical studies of piperacillin shows that it is valuable for the treatment of respiratory infections due to Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas sp, anaerobes, and mixed flora including anaerobes. Various studies of a total of 420 patients treated with piperacillin for lower respiratory tract infections found that 97% of the patients were cured or markedly improved. Piperacillin has also been found as effective as combination therapy (gentamicin or tobramycin plus carbenicillin or ticarcillin) in the treatment of serious infections, including pneumonia and several caused by gram-negative organisms and anaerobic organisms. A review of the literature on bacteriological responses to piperacillin shows that 126 of 153 (82%) of the susceptible strains could be eradicated. Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Peptostreptococcus sp, Bacteroides sp, and Fusobacterium sp have been completely eradicated by treatment with piperacillin. Most of the published studies indicate that therapy with the drug is usually well tolerated.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of photoradiation therapy with hematoporphyrin derivative.
AB  - Hematoporphyrin derivative (Hpd) localizes selectively in malignant and rapidly metabolizing tissues and undergoes a cytotoxic reaction when exposed to light of a specific wavelength. Hpd has been studied extensively with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of tumors but not with regard to bactericidal activity. This investigation assessed the effect of light-activated Hpd on various microorganisms, on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and on the interactions of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and bacteria. Light-activated Hpd was 99.9% bactericidal against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus M-G intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptococcus magnus, and Clostridium perfringens, but did not affect Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Candida albicans. Photoactivation of Hpd rendered 98% of polymorphonuclear leukocytes inviable. Combinations of light-activated Hpd and polymorphonuclear leukocytes had a 4-log (99.99%) bactericidal effect on both intra- and extracellular S. aureus. The ability of Hpd to localize in inflammatory tissues may have therapeutic applications in the treatment of abscesses.
TI  - Bacteriology of chronic tonsillitis in young adults.
AB  - Tonsils were obtained from 22 young adults (mean age, 23 years) suffering from chronic tonsillitis. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora was obtained from core tonsillar cultures in all patients, yielding an average of 9.0 isolates (5.3 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes) per specimen. The predominant anaerobic isolates were Bacteroides sp, Fusobacterium sp, and gram-positive cocci. The predominant aerobic isolates were alpha-hemolytic streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Branhamella catarrhalis, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and hemophilus sp. beta-Lactamase-production was noted in 32 isolates recovered from 18 tonsils (82%). These included all eight isolates of S aureus and five B fragilis, and 11 of 24 B melaninogenicus group (46%). Our findings indicate the polymicrobial nature of deep tonsillar flora in young adults with chronic tonsillitis, and demonstrate the presence of beta-lactamase-producing organisms in most of the patients.

AB  
TI  - Pathogenicity of anaerobic gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The pathogenicity of 20 strains of facultative or anaerobic gram-positive cocci (AGPC) was investigated by injecting them alone or mixed with other flora into mice, utilizing the subcutaneous abscess model. Abscesses induced by a mixture of two organisms were uniformly larger than those induced by single organisms. The relationships among seven AGPC strains, eight aerobes, and two Bacteroides spp. were determined by treating the infected animals with antibiotics and observing the effect of therapy directed against one or both organisms present in the abscess. A total of 70 different combinations were tested. As judged by their responses to antimicrobial therapy, facultative cocci or AGPC were relatively more important than the other species in 6 combinations, equally important in 35 combinations, and less important in 29 combinations. The AGPC most often found to be equal to or more important than the other bacteria were Peptococcus magnus, Streptococcus constellatus, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus were frequently found to be of more importance than the AGPC.

TI  - Clinical efficacy of cefoperazone in obstetric and gynecologic infections.
AB  - Compared with second-generation cephalosporins, cefoperazone, a third-generation  cephalosporin, has demonstrated an extended antibacterial spectrum. In addition, it has a long serum half-life and requires only twice-a-day administration. In this study, 66 patients with clinically diagnosed obstetric and gynecologic infections were treated with cefoperazone, and 61 were evaluated for efficacy. An overall cure rate of 93% (57 patients) was achieved. In view of the excellent clinical response and convenience of twice-a-day administration, we conclude that cefoperazone is a clinically useful single agent for the initial empirical treatment of patients with obstetric and gynecologic infections.
TI  - Bacteriology of dental abscesses of endodontic origin.
AB  - Aspirates have been cultured from 10 dental abscesses of endodontic origin, all of which had penetrated beyond the bony alveolus to produce fluctuant swelling. Sampling was by syringe aspiration. Strict anaerobic techniques, including the use of an anaerobic chamber, were used for serial dilution and plating. Randomly selected colonies (100) from each culture were purified, characterized, and identified. Seventy percent of the bacterial isolates were either strict anaerobes or microaerophilic. One abscess yielded a pure culture of a viridans streptococcus, Streptococcus milleri. Streptococcus intermedius dominated the flora in a second abscess. The common oral streptococcus, Streptococcus sanguis, constituted only 2% of the isolates from one additional infection. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, other Bacteroides including B. oralis and B. ruminicola, anaerobic diphtheroids, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Staphylococcus epidermis were other predominant isolates.
TI  - Production of histolytic enzymes by a combination of oral bacteria with known pathogenicity.
AB  - Eight oral bacterial strains, isolated from an infected root canal, have been investigated for their capacity to produce histolytic enzymes. The determination was performed using methods espoused by two different principles. Eleven out of 12 enzymes examined were demonstrated in the "eight-strain collection". In no single bacterial strain were all enzymes revealed. It was suggested that the pathogenicity of the bacterial strains, singly or in combination, was not solely dependent on the production of these enzymes. The histolytic enzymes may have a potentiating role on other pathogenic factors in infectious diseases.
TI  - [Clinical experience with cefotiam in otorhinolaryngologic infections].
AB  - Clinical studies of cefotiam (CTM), a new cephalosporin derivative, in otorhinolaryngological field were performed, and the results were summarized as follows. CTM was intravenously injected to 31 cases of otorhinolaryngological infections in daily dose of 1--4 g. Clinical efficacy was 33.3% in acute otitis media and chronic otitis media (acute exacerbation) (6 cases), 90% in acute tonsillitis (including peritonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess) (20 cases), 50% in acute pharyngitis (2 cases), 100% in acute sinusitis (2 cases) and 100% in epiglottis abscess (1 case), respectively. Bacteriological efficacy was 80% for beta-Streptococcus, 100% for K. pneumoniae, 50% for P. aeruginosa, and 85.7% for Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus, respectively. No difference was observed in various daily doses for clinical efficacy. As for side effects and laboratory findings, eruption in 1 case, elevation of GOT in 1 case and elevation of GOT, GPT in 2 cases were observed. But, all of the cases were normalized after stoppage of administration or postadministration.
TI  - Susceptibility of brain to aerobic, anaerobic, and fungal organisms.
AB  - The utility of an experimental animal model is dependent on its ability to simulate the actual clinical situation. With a stereotaxic injection procedure, the susceptibility of rat brain to the spectrum of organisms commonly associated with human brain abscess was determined. Two strains of Escherichia coli were more infective than Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Even between the E. coli strains it was possible to document significant differences in degree of infectivity. The E. coli strain with the K-1 capsular polysaccharide was significantly more infective than the E. coli strain without the capsular polysaccharide. The brain was also susceptible to Candida albicans, but at a level higher than any of the aerobic bacteria examined. Brain infection could not be created when microaerophilic or obligately anaerobic organisms alone were injected.
TI  - [Use of cephalosporins as antibiotic prophylaxis in cesarean section].
AB  - Cefoxitin, a second-generation cephalosporin, was compared with cefazolin, a first-generation cephalosporin, and a placebo in a prospective, double-blind study of antibiotic prophylaxis in women undergoing nonelective cesarean section. In the groups that received cefazolin or the placebo there eas no statistically significant change in colonization of the cervix by aerobic bacteria by the fourth day after the operation, but there was a statistically significant increase in colonization by anaerobes. Cefoxitin had the opposite effect. Of the 14 postoperative infections in 11 patients, significantly more were in patients who had received the placebo; the numbers were too small to show a difference in effectiveness between the two antibiotics. Of the microorganisms implicated as the infectious agents, group B Streptococcus was the most frequent aerobe, and Peptostreptococcus and Bacteroides bivius were the most frequent anaerobes. Among the 15 patients for whom at least one perioperative specimen yielded positive culture results, a postoperative infection developed in 5 of the 6 who received the placebo, 2 of the 4 who received cefazolin and 1 of the 5 who received cefoxitin.
TI  - Perineal Crohn's disease complicated by pyogenic liver abscess during metronidazole therapy.
AB  - A patient with ileal and perineal Crohn's disease developed a pyogenic liver abscess caused by Streptococcus milleri. The perineal process had been treated with high-dose metronidazole for the preceding 6 mo, and culture of a perianal abscess 2 mo before admission revealed heavy growth of Streptococcus milleri (which was misidentified as an anaerobic Peptostreptococcus). This case illustrates the difficulty in correctly identifying Streptococcus milleri, the most frequent isolate from pyogenic liver abscesses. Furthermore, the events suggest that metronidazole therapy can allow overgrowth of this organism in perineal abscesses which, in turn, may predispose to the development of purulent foci such as liver abscesses. This effect on the bacterial ecology of the perineum should be considered when opting for metronidazole therapy of perineal Crohn's disease.
TI  - The frequency and some characteristics of anaerobic bacteria isolated from various forms of bovine mastitis.
AB  - The prevalence of strictly anaerobic bacteria in the secretions from untreated cases of mastitis in lactating dairy cows was investigated. The study involved 147 Friesland cows in 12 highveld herds. All herds yielded cows with anaerobic udder infections. No anaerobic bacteria were recovered from cows with normal quarters or those with latent aerobic infections. Only anaerobes were present in 10% of so-called 'aseptic' mastitis cases. A variety of anaerobic organisms was isolated concurrently with facultative bacteria from 5,3% and 58,8% of cases classified as subclinical and clinical respectively. Peptococcus spp. was associated with Corynebacterium pyogenes and Bacteroides spp. with Staphylococcus aureus and/or Streptococcus agalactiae in 80% anaerobic udder infections. Gram positive anaerobic species were mostly sensitive to penicillin-G but all the Gram negative rods were resistant. In addition, all B. fragilis strains produced beta-lactamase. The ability to produce heparinase was demonstrated in one strain of Peptococcus indolicus and a Peptostreptococcus sp.
TI  - Cefoperazone therapy for obstetric and gynecologic infections.
AB  - The safety and clinical efficacy of cefoperazone therapy for obstetric and gynecologic infections have been evaluated in clinical trials involving 107 women hospitalized at nine medical centers. The indications for cefoperazone therapy have included post-partum and postoperative uterine infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, postoperative pelvic infections, and miscellaneous pelvic infections. A variety of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including members of the genera Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Escherichia, Klebsiella, Proteus, Neisseria, Bacteroides, Peptococcus, and Peptostreptococcus, were isolated from these patients. More than 80% of these isolates were inhibited in vitro by cefoperazone concentrations less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml. Symptomatic cures were achieved in 91% of patients, and 96% of isolated pathogens were eradicated during therapy. Adverse drug-related reactions occurred in only 4% of patients. Follow-up laboratory evaluations demonstrated only minor abnormalities that affected a small number of patients. These results indicate that cefoperazone offers safe and effective therapy for common obstetric and gynecologic infections.
TI  - Polyclonal B-cell activating capacities of gram-positive bacteria frequently isolated from periodontally diseased sites.
AB  
TI  - Microorganisms isolated from peritonsillar abscess and indicated chemotherapy.
AB  - A bacteriologic study was made of 30 patients with peritonsillar abscesses with the use of both aerobic and anaerobic culture procedures. The abscess was punctured and the pus was aspirated by a syringe with an 18-gauge needle. Aerobes and anaerobes were detected in a frequency rate of approximately 1:2. Peptostreptococcus (30.2%), group a streptococci (27.9%), Peptococcus (16.3%), and Fusobacterium (9.3%) were preponderant pathogens. Anaerobic organisms were isolated in 75% of 30 cases. Aside from group A streptococci, anaerobes play a major etiologic role in peritonsillar abscess. Penicillins or cephalosporins will provide maximum chemotherapeutic benefit.
TI  - [Evaluation of humoral response to selected bacterial antigens in dental focal infections].
AB  
TI  - Circulating antibodies after experimental chronic infection in the root canal of  teeth in monkeys.
AB  - Root canals of 49 teeth with necrotic pulp tissue in five monkeys were infected with Streptococcus faecalis ss liquefaciens, Actinomyces bovis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Bacteroides oralis in various combinations. After 6 months the root canals and the periapical tissues were subjected to radiographic, bacteriologic, and histologic examinations. Signs of periapical inflammation were radiographically registered in 41 teeth, most frequently in teeth inoculated with a mixed flora. In 11 out of 16 teeth infected separately with Strep. faecalis ss liquefaciens, apical periodontitis was observed. Sera from the monkeys prior to and after the experimental inoculation were analyzed by means of gel diffusion, hemagglutination (HA), and complement binding test for antibodies against different antigen preparations of the homologous bacterial strains used for the inoculation. Detectable antibodies were seen with antigens of B. oralis in all five monkeys. Agglutinating antibodies were demonstrated with lipopolysaccharide-antigen of B. oralis in titers between 1:40 and 1:320. A marked reduction of the antibody level against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigen after mercaptoethanol treatment indicated that a main part of the antibodies registered was of IgM-class. The study shows that certain antigens of bacterial origin from infected root canals, while affecting the periapical tissues, also stimulate the production of circulating antibodies.
TI  - [Assessment of the leukocyte migration inhibition test in response to selected bacterial antigens from dental focal infections].
AB  
TI  - Streptococcus pneumoniae and three species of anaerobic bacteria in experimental  otitis media in guniea pigs.
AB  - Three species of anaerobic bacteria commonly isolated in upper respiratory tract  infections in humans were studied in an animal model of otitis media. The ability of Propionibacterium acnes to induce acute otitis media was comparable with that of streptococcus pneumoniae, the classic middle ear pathogen. The response to Peptostreptococcus micros was weak and irregular, and no effects of Bacteroides asaccharolyticus were observed despite the use of high doses (10(8) colony-forming unite per ear). The results of this study support the contention that anaerobic bacteria such as P. acnes may be true pathogens in middle ear infections.
TI  - [Evaluation of clinical efficacy of a cephem antibiotic, cefmetazole, in inflammatory infections of the upper respiratory tract].
AB  - We had reported the fundamental study on the utility of a new cephem antibiotic,  cefmetazole (CMZ). On the basis of the results we administered CMZ to patients to investigate its clinical utility in this study. 1. CMZ was administered to 53 patients including 4 infants. They consisted of 30 cases of acute tonsillitis, 10 of peritonsillar abscess, 10 of laryngitis or pharyngitis, and 3 of sinusitis. 2. One of 2 g CMZ was administered to an adult patient except for l case and 0.5 g to an infant patient once or twice daily for at least 3 days. The method of administration was one shot intravenous injection, intravenous drip infusion or intramuscular injection. 3. The strict criteria for evaluating the efficacy of a drug were made and used for judging the efficacy of CMZ. 4. CMZ was clinically effective in 100% of patients with acute tonsillitis, 100% of those with peritonsillar abscess, 90% of those with laryngitis or pharyngitis, and 67% of those with sinusitis. 5. Bacteriologically, a single sort of bacterium was isolated in most cases of acute tonsillitis, laryngitis and pharyngitis and in the half of cases of peritonsillar abscess. Two and more sorts of bacteria were isolated in the other cases. The main bacteria isolated were beta-Streptococcus, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. Anaerobic bacteria, mostly Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp., were detected in peritonsillar abscess. 6. The clinical results agreed with the clinicobacteriological results. All the bacteria detected before treatment of CMZ disappeared. CMZ also acted effectively in cases in which H. influenzae was suspected to be a causative organism. 7. The present results of CMZ treatment were similar to those of cefazolin (CEZ) treatment published so far. 8. Thus, CMZ was confirmed fundamentally and clinically to be a very useful drug for infection of the upper respiratory tract.
TI  - [Clinical bacteriological studies on cefotiam and cefsulodin in the field of otorhinolaryngology].
AB  - Clinical bacteriological studies on cefotiam and cefsulodin in the field of otorhinolaryngology were carried out and the following results were obtained. 1) Aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were dominantly isolated from the clinical materials sent to the center from the clinical institutes. 2) It was considered that Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and beta-Streptococcus played an important role in the primary infections in the field of otorhinolaryngology. Staphylococcus aureus was also frequently isolated from the primary infections. Peptostreptococcus spp. was dominantly isolated from peritonsillar abscess. Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) were mainly isolated from the chronic secondary infections. Among GNB, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus spp. were more frequently isolated. Staphylococcus aureus was also constantly detected in the secondary infections together with GNB. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 20.1% of the patients with chronic otitis media and 27.1% of sinusitis. 3) Cefotiam showed potent antibacterial activities against most isolates of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. 4) Cefsulodin showed potent antibacterial activities against clinically isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Staphylococcus aureus and beta-Streptococcus were also susceptible to cefsulodin.
TI  - The fermentation of lactulose by colonic bacteria.
AB  - Sixty-four strains of intestinal bacteria were cultured under anaerobic conditions in lactulose-containing media to assess their ability to ferment lactulose. Some organisms were unable to metabolize the disaccharide, while others, e.g. clostridia and lactobacilli, metabolized lactulose extensively. Quantitative analyses of the fermentation products indicated that the major non-gaseous metabolites were acetic, lactic and butyric acids. Hydrogen and carbon dioxide were the only gases detected. Fermentation products were estimated for selected species throughout their growth cycles. The products of fermentation of lactulose by stool cultures varied with incubation conditions such as pH, but correlated well with those produced by pure cultures. These results are discussed in relation to the therapeutic uses of lactulose.
TI  - Characterization of bacteria from a Swine manure digester.
AB  - One-hundred thirty bacteria isolated from a swine manure digester were predominately gram-positive anaerobes which were tentatively classified into the following genera: Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium, Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Peptococcus, Clostridium, and Streptococcus plus two unidentified groups. The major fermentation products formed by these organisms included acetate, propionate, succinate, lactate, and ethanol, singly or in various combinations. Acetate was the sole end product of several groups. Few of the isolates (14%) reduced the pH below 6.0. The predominate bacteria appear to differ from the predominate organisms isolated from other anaerobic ecosystems.
TI  - A bacteriological and/or immunological study of anaerobic streptococcal infection in chronic tonsillitis, paratonsillitis and periodontitis patients.
AB  - Anaerobic streptococci were isolated from 100% of tonsil tissue samples obtained  from 36 chronic tonsillitis patients. The strains displayed antigenic and other differences. Sera of chronic tonsillitis, paratonsillitis and periodontitis patients exhibited significantly more often, and in significantly higher titres, antibodies to the anaerobic streptococci isolated from tonsils than did sera of normal persons.
TI  - Identification of attached bacteria in the nasopharynx of the child.
AB  - Bacteria attached to epithelial cells in mucus and cell scrapings obtained from the nasopharynx in children undergoing adenoidectomy appear rather monomorphic under the microscope, and for this reason it is not possible to identify different species. To overcome this difficulty, a micromanipulation method has been devised which allows the isolation of single squamous epithelial cells seen to carry bacteria. The cells are transferred to culture media for bacteriological analysis. Ciliated epithelial cells were never seen to carry bacteria, and cultures or these cells gave no growth. Bacterial growth was found in 36 of 47 cultures of single epithelial cells seen to carry 10 to 50 bacteria. Two species were isolated from 11 cultures and three species from one culture. Viridans streptococci dominated; the most frequently isolated species was Streptococcus mitior, followed by Streptococcus group K. In all, 15 different species were found to adhere to squamous epithelial cells in the nasopharynx.
TI  - [A fundamental and clinical study of ceftizoxime in the field of obstetrics and gynecology (author's transl)].
AB  - A fundamental and clinical study of ceftizoxime (CZX), a new cephalosporin antibiotic, has brought about the following results. 1. The antibacterial activity of CZX against Bacteriodes fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron was superior to that of CEZ, but inferior to that of CFX. CZX was the most active of the 3 drugs against B. distasonis, and was as active as CFX against B. vulgatus. The MICs of CZX against Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus and anaerobic Streptococcus were 1.56 microgram/ml or lower. CEZ was more active than CZX against these anaerobic cocci. 2. The concentrations of CZX in female genital organs and retroperitoneal dead space exudate after drip infusion of 1 g were high enough to fulfill the MICs of many bacterial isolates. 3. CZX administered intravenously to 9 patients in daily doses of 1 approximately 8 g for 4 approximately 11 days was 100% effective. Pathogenic bacteria in 6 of the patients were eradicated in 4 and partially eradicated in 1. The other patient had no bacteriological examination after therapy. 4. No adverse reaction was observed. From above results it is concluded that CZX must be one of the most effective antibiotics for the treatment of gynecological infections.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of peritonsillar abscess in children.
AB  - Aspiration of peritonsillar abscess (quinsy) was aseptically performed in 16 children. Patients' median age was 10 years (range 6 to 17 years), and 12 were males. Unilateral abscess was present in all but one child. All aspirates were cultured for aerobes and anaerobes and yielded bacterial growth in all patients. Anaerobes were isolated in all patients; in 3 patients (19%), they were the only organism isolated, and in 13 (81%), they were mixed with aerobes. There were 91 anaerobic isolates (5.7 per specimen): 42 Bacteroides sp. (including 23 B. melaninogenicus, 5 B. oralis and 4 B. ruminicola ss. brevis); 18 anaerobic Gram-positive cocci (including 10 Peptostreptococcus sp., 4 Peptococcus sp. and 4 microaerophilic streptococci); 15 Fusobacterium sp.; and 3 Clostridium sp. There were 32 aerobic isolates (2.0 per specimen): 11 gamma-hemolytic streptococci, 8 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 4 Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, 4 Haemophilus sp. and 3 S. aureus. Beta-lactamase production was noted in 13 isolates recovered from 11 patients (68%). These were all isolates of S. aureus (3), 8 of 23 B. melaninogenicus (35%), and 2 of 5 B. oralis (40%). Our findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of peritonsillar abscesses in children, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in two thirds of the patients.
TI  - [Comparison of antibacterial activity of cefmenoxime with other cephalosporins against clinically isolated bacteria (author's transl)].
AB  - We examined the antibacterial activity of MX in comparison with those of other CEPs, using aerobic Gram-positive cocci, aerobic Gram-negative bacilli and anaerobic bacteria, 870 strains in total, all isolated from clinical specimens, in 1979 and 1980. Against Streptococcus, CMX showed superior antibacterial activity than those of CFX, CMZ, CXM and CTM. Against H. influenzae, CMX also showed superior antibacterial activity than those of CFX, CMX, CXM, CTM and CEZ. ABPC-and PIPC-resistant strains were sensitive to CMX. CTX, CPZ and CZX also showed antibacterial activities equivalent to that of CMX. Against enteric bacteria, E. coli, Klebsiella, E. cloacae, Serratia, C. freundii and Proteus, CMX showed superior antibacterial activity than those of CFX, CMZ, CXM, CTM and CEZ. Especially, against E. coli, Klebsiella, P. mirabilis, P. rettgeri and P. inconstans, CMX showed strong antibacterial activity. As to non-fermentation bacteria, CMX's antibacterial activity was relatively weak except P. putrefaciens, Alcaligenes and Comamonas. However, it was superior than that of CEZ. In comparison with other CEPs, the strength of CMX varied according to the kinds of bacteria. As to anaerobic bacteria, CMX showed strong antibacterial activity against Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Lactobacillus, Propionibacterium, C. perfringens, Veillonella and Fusobacterium. However, its antibacterial activity against Bacteroides was similar to those of other CEPs.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of ceftazidime (GR-20263) and other beta-lactamase  stable cephalosporins against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of ceftazidime was determined against 586 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria by an agar-dilution technique and compared with that of cefuroxime, moxalactam and cefoxitin. At 16 mg/l, only 60% of all isolates were inhibited by ceftazidime, compared to 79% by cefuroxime, 81% by moxalactam and 80% by cefoxitin. Ceftazidime was relatively inactive against Bacteroides fragilis group, Lactobacillus and Clostridium species other than Cl. perfringens. Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Cl. perfringens, microaerophilic streptococci and Propionibacterium were readily inhibited. Moxalactam was the most active agent against Bact. fragilis group, while cefuroxime was the most active agent against Streptococcus and Lactobacillus.
TI  - Hydrolytic enzymes of anaerobic bacteria isolated from human infections.
AB  - Thirty-three strains of anaerobic bacteria isolated from human clinical specimens were examined for the presence of heparinase, hyaluronidase, chondroitin sulfatase, gelatinase, collagenase, fibrinolysin, lecithinase, and lipase activities. Pronounced heparinase activity was limited to species of the genus Bacteroides. A number of species of the genera Bacteroides and Clostridium produced hyaluronidase and chondroitin sulfatase. Gelatinase, collagenase, and fibrinolysin activities were encountered in isolates of the genera Bacteroides, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. All strains capable of degrading collagen also hydrolyzed other protein substrates. Lipolytic activity was minimal among these anaerobic bacteria. No specific hydrolytic activity was consistently associated with the isolates.
TI  - Bacteriologic study of paronychia in children.
AB  
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in tonsils of children with recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  - Tonsils were obtained from 50 children suffering from recurrent tonsillitis. Patients' ages ranged from 2.5 to 17 years (mean 6 years); 29 were males and 21 females. The tonsils were sectioned in half after heat searing of the surface and the core material was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora was obtained in all patients, yielding an average of 7.8 isolates (4.1 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes) per specimen. There were 207 anaerobes isolated. The predominant isolates were 101 Bacteroides sp (including 10 B fragilis group, and 47 B melaninogenicus group), 29 Fusobacterium sp, 34 Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (25 Peptococcus sp and 9 Peptostreptococcus sp) and 16 Veillonella sp. There were 185 aerobic isolates. The predominant isolates were 41 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 24 Staphylococcus aureus, 19 beta-hemolytic streptococci (11 group A, 4 group B, and 2 each group C and F), 14 Haemophilus sp (including 12 H influenzae type B) and 5 H parainfluenzae. Beta-lactamase production was noted in 56 isolates recovered from 37 tonsils. These were all isolates of S aureus (24) and B fragilis (10), 15 of 47 B melaninogenicus (32%), 5 of the 12 B oralis (42%), and 2 of 12 H influenzae type B (17%). Our findings indicate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic nature of deep tonsillar flora in children with recurrent tonsillitis, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in 74% of the patients.
TI  - Production of deoxyribonuclease, ribonuclease, coagulase, and hemolysins by anaerobic gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Clinical isolates of Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus species and Streptococcus intermedius strains were obtained from local hospitals. After confirmed identification, each isolate was tested for the in vitro production of deoxyribonuclease, ribonuclease, coagulase, and hemolysins. Of the 60 strains studied, 18 had enzymatic activity. The variability of enzyme production suggests that such assays are not suitable as an aid to identification of these organisms.
TI  - Premature labor. II. Bacterial sources of phospholipase.
AB  - Human term labor is thought to be initiated by amniotic and chorionic phospholipase A2, an enzyme that liberates arachidonic acid esters from the phospholipids of these membranes, leading to the synthesis of prostaglandins by the placental membranes. The striking association of premature labor with intrauterine infection or contamination, urinary tract infection, and early neonatal sepsis led us to study the microorganisms present in these infections for phospholipase A2 activity. Activity was found in Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Streptococcus viridans, Streptococcus fecalis, Streptococcus A and B, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pneumococcus, Lactobacillus, and Mycoplasma hominis. Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium, and S viridans had the highest activities. The specific activities of phospholipase A2 from these organisms were several times higher than that of the membrane phospholipase A2 of the amnion and chorion. We postulate that premature labor may be initiated by microorganisms with phospholipase A2 activity from endocervical and/or intrauterine contamination or infection, producing deacylation of arachidonic acid from amniotic phospholipids with increased concentrations of free arachidonic acid and increased prostaglandin synthesis, which triggers labor.
TI  - Management of an anaerobic infection in a prosthetic knee with long-term antibiotics alone: a case report.
AB  - A 74-year-old woman had a spherocentric arthroplasty performed on her left knee.  After four postoperative weeks, she developed and swelling in the joint. An anaerobic streptococcus was isolated from a joint aspirate. The patient was treated solely with knee immobilization and intravenous penicillin G for five weeks. Joint aspirates at the end of treatment and six months posttreatment were sterile. However, after ten posttreatment months, the peptostreptococcal infection recurred. Sterile joint aspirates six months after treatment are insufficient evidence of cure in prosthetic joint infections.
TI  - Bacterial interference between Clostridium difficile and normal fecal flora.
AB  - Clostridium difficile has been shown to be the cause of virtually all cases of pseudomembranous colitis related to the administration of antimicrobial agents. It is possible that some antimicrobial agents alter the normal bacterial flora of the gastrointestinal tract so as to permit colonization and/or proliferation by C. difficile. The inhibitory activity of representative fecal bacteria from 23 anaerobic and aerobic genera against C. difficile was examined using two in vitro procedures. Strains of bacteria in six of the genera inhibited the multiplication of C. difficile, with Lactobacillus organisms and group D enterococci displaying the most antagonistic activity. C. difficile was examined for its ability to inhibit the multiplication of several fecal strains of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. All eight strains of C. difficile tested inhibited the growth of particular strains of bacteria in the genera Bacteroides, Peptococcus, and Peptostreptococcus.
TI  - Microbial flora of the lower genital tract of women in labour in Zaria, Nigeria.
AB  - Nine genera of microbes isolated from the lower genital tract of 187 women in labour in Zaria have been identified. The work was undertaken to establish the nature of microorganisms in the lower genital tract of women in labour as a basis for further study. The isolates in order of prevalence were: Candida albicans (20.9%), Klebsiella sp (15.0%), Escherichia coli (9.1%), Streptococcus faecalis (6.4%), haemolytic streptococci (other than Streptococcus pyogenes (2.7%), Streptococcus viridans (2.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (2.1%), Aeromonas hydrophila (2.1%), Proteus mirabilis (1.1%), Peptostreptococcus putridus (1.1%), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.5%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.5%). Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus sp, Lactobacillus sp, and Clostridium sp were sought but not found. Chlamydia, viruses, and T-strains of mycoplasma and trichomonas were not sought. It appears from this study that the lower genital tract of most women in Zaria at the time of labour is heavily colonised by pathogens. For this reason alone prolonged labour and trauma to the genital tract at the time of delivery should be avoided.
TI  - Bactericidal effect of hydrogen peroxide is prevented by the lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate system under anaerobic conditions.
AB  - Streptococcus sanguis and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were exposed to various combinations of the components of the lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide system. The bactericidal effect of hydrogen peroxide was prevented under anaerobic conditions by lactoperoxidase together with thiocyanate, but not by lactoperoxidase or thiocyanate alone. Thiocyanate was effective already at a molar ratio to hydrogen peroxide of 1:100.
TI  - Puerperal sepsis in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea.
AB  - Because puerperal sepsis is the second most common cause of maternal death in Papua New Guinea some aspects of its aetiology and prevention have been investigated. 91% of 125 women with puerperal fever were found to have post-partum uterine infection. The anaerobes Bacteroides and Peptostreptococcus singly or together, were the commonest causes, while Streptococcus pyogenes was the predominant aerobic species. Antibiotic sensitivity patterns were established, and chloramphenicol was found to be the most active agent against anaerobic and most aerobic strains. Endocervical cultures obtained from 103 ante-partum and 50 afebrile post-partum women demonstrated all the species associated with post-partum genital infection in this study. An analysis of the records of all patients was made to determine the redisposing factors associated with puerperal fever; only operative delivery was found to be significant, especially when it followed prolonged labour. Metronidazole given to 72 women before induction of labour was associated with puerperal fever in 4%, compared with 21% in matched controls.
TI  - Bacterial studies of peritoneal cavity and postoperative surgical wound drainage  following perforated appendix in children.
AB  - This study reports bacterial specimens obtained from 112 children presenting with a ruptured appendix. Additional samples were studied from 11 of these patients who developed a postoperative surgical draining wound. Bacterial growth occurred in 100 peritoneal fluid specimens. Anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 14 specimens, aerobes alone in 12, and mixed aerobic an anerobic flora in 74 specimens. There were 144 aerobic isolates (1.4 per specimen). The predominant isolates were: E. coli (57 specimens); alpha-hemolytic steptococcus (16 specimens); gamma-hemolytic streptococcus (15 specimens); Group D streptococcus (12 specimens); and P. aeruginosa (9 specimens). There were 301 anaerobic isolates (three per specimen). The predominant isolates were: 157 Bacteroides spp. (including 92 B. fragilis group and 26 B. melaninogenicus group); 62 gram-positive anaerobic cocci (including 30 Peptococcus sp.; 29 Peptostreptococcus sp.); 27 Fusobactenium sp.; and 16 Clostridium sp. B. fragilis and Peptococcus sp. occurred in 23 patients. Beta lactamase production was detectable in 98 isolates recovered from 74 patients. These included all isolates of B. fragilis and six of the 23 Bacteroides sp. Forty-nine organisms (16 aerobic and 33 anaerobic) were recovered from the draining wounds. The predominant organisms were: B. fragilis (8 specimens); E. coli (6 specimens); Peptostreptococcus sp. (5 specimens); and three specimens each of P. aeruginosa and Peptococcus sp. Most of these isolates were also recovered from the peritoneal cavity of the patients. These findings demonstrate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic nature of peritoneal cavity and postoperative wound flora in children with perforated appendix, and demonstrate the presence of beta lactamase-producing organisms in three-fourths of the patients.
TI  - Pediatric infectious cervical lymphadenitis.
AB  - Infectious cervical lymphadenitis is a frequently encountered problem in the pediatric population. The recent experience with infectious cervical lymphadenitis at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia was reviewed. The most common etiologic agent was Staphylococcus aureus. beta-Hemolytic streptococcus and mycobacterium were found in 15% and 6% of cases respectively. Other agents included pneumococcus, cat scratch, Toxoplasma gondii, actinomycosis, and mixed bacteroides and peptostreptococcus. Most patients responded to high-dose intravenous antistaphylococcal penicillin. Needle aspiration proved successful in identifying the casual agent in a high percentage of cases. Aspiration was also beneficial in draining small abscess cavities. Surgical drainage was rarely necessary.
TI  - [Pleuro-pulmonary infections with anaerobic germs (author's transl)].
AB  - The author presents his experience with the study of 42 patients with pleuro-pulmonary infection with anaerobic germs. He underlines the value of research tending to improve the conditions of sampling and culturing to ensure a bacteriological diagnosis and the setting of a suitable therapy.
TI  - [Saprophytic and opportunistic non spore-forming anaerobic microflora of the vagina (author's transl)].
AB  - A microbiological survey has been carried out on 179 healthy, child-bearing aged, non-pregnant women, with the aim to evaluate the incidence of anaerobic non-spore forming bacteria in the normal vaginal flora. This group of bacteria has been isolated in 50.3% of women, with a clear prevalence of "anaerobic Streptococci " and Bacteroides, followed by Fusobacterium and Veillonella. No Propionibacterium, Eubacterium or Bifidobacterium have been isolated. According to many Authors the non-spore forming anaerobes must be considered opportunistic bacteria, responsible of many infections of the female genital tract, especially when associated with other aerobic or facultative bacteria. Antibiograms have demonstrated a wide spectrum of activity of chloramphenicol and clindamycin; although not widely distributed, antibacterial activity have also shown metronidazole, penicillins, cephalosporins and lincomycin.
TI  - Microorganisms associated with abscesses of sheep and goats in the south of Iran.
AB  - A total of 86 abscesses (45 and 41) abscesses of sheep and goats, respectively) were examined for their causal agents; 44 of these abscesses were located subcutaneously, and the remaining 42 were in lungs, livers, intestines, and udders. A total of 23 different types of microorganisms were isolated from 78 abscesses; bacteria were not detected in the remaining eight abscesses. Microorganisms isolated were: species of the genera Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus and Pasteurella, Escherichia coli, and other gram-negative rods. Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Eubacterium tortuosum were isolated in pure culture from one abscess each in goats. Two to four different microorganisms were associated with 25 of the 86 abscesses. It was determined that 11 isolates of Corynebacterium pyogenes, 2 isolates of Pasteurella haemolytica, 1 of P multocida, and 1 of C pseudotuberculosis were lethal to mice. Two of the C pyogenes isolates from subcutaneous spreading abscesses of goats were pathogenic for rabbits; these two isolates produced similar suppurative inflammation in goats experimentally, but did not cause death. As determined by experimental inoculation, goats were more susceptible than sheep to the two isolates. In nature, subcutaneous abscesses of goats associated with C pyogenes were of a more diffusive type which resulted in generalization of the infection and death of the animals. Postmortem examination of ten goats dying of field infection showed the presence of larvae of the warble-fly Przhevalskiana silenus at the site of infection.
TI  - Antigenic relationships and rapid identification of Peptostreptococcus species.
AB  - Antisera against whole cells of each Peptostreptococcus species (P. anaerobius, P. micros, P. parvulus, and P. productus) were produced in rabbits. When these antisera were reacted against sonically disrupted cells and culture supernatant fluids in Ouchterlony tests, lines of identity were obtained among the antigens from all the species and uninoculated culture medium. When the antisera were subsequently absorbed with the dehydrated culture medium used to grow the peptostreptococci, all cross-reactions in heterologous antigen-antibody combinations were eliminated, leaving only species-specific precipitin arcs. These absorbed antisera, specific for each Peptostreptococcus species by Ouchterlony tests, were used for rapid identification studies. Staphylococcus aureus-bearing protein A was sensitized with each absorbed antiserum. These reagents produced specific coagglutination reactions with suspensions of each Peptostreptococcus reference strain and with 16 clinical isolates. No cross-reactions occurred with the Streptococcus intermedius, Peptococcus magnus, or Peptococcus asaccharolyticus strains tested.
TI  - Do anaerobes cause urinary tract infection?
AB  
TI  - The assay on a defined medium of the effects of beta-2-thienylalanine on the growth of anaerobic bacterial isolates from phenylketonuric patients.
AB  - Faecal samples were taken from three diet-managed phenylketonuric children to determine effects of beta-2-thienylalanine (beta-2-t) on indigenous bacteria. From sample swabs, 127 anaerobes were identified and tested for beta-2-t inhibition on a phenylalanine (Phe)-free medium, Anaerobe Inhibition Test (AIT) agar. Of the isolates, 77.9% grew sufficiently to assay reactions on at least 25% of AIT plates. Using Phe-containing Columbia agar, 86.5% of the strains could be assayed. None of 28 Bacteroides cultures was inhibited by beta-2-t on AIT. Of the genera, Bifidobacterium, Eubacterium, Lactobacillus, Peptostreptococcus, and Propionibacterium, no isolates which would grow on AIT were inhibited. At least one isolate of each of the genera Peptococcus, Fusobacterium, and Clostridium was inhibited. Of 127 total isolates, only nine were inhibited by beta-2-t on AIT, and inhibition was abolished on Columbia agar. Thirty-nine "aerobes" were isolated from the same patients. Strains of the genera tested reacted similarly to previously tested strains from non-PKU sources. Also, anaerobically isolated Excherichia coli were inhibited, while Streptococcus faecalis cultures were not, confirming results on aerobically-isolated non-PKU cultures of the same species. These studies, the first dealing with beta-2-t and anaerobic bacteria, suggest that little change in intestinal bacterial populations might be expected during in vivo beta-2-t treatment.
TI  - Differentiation of Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus by gas-liquid chromatography of cellular fatty acids and metabolic products.
AB  - Gas-liquid chromatographic (GLC) profiles of cellular fatty acids and metabolic products were useful in identifying strains of Peptococcus saccharolyticus, Peptococcus asaccharolyticus, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Streptococcus intermedius. The GLC results supported the recent taxonomic decision to transfer aerotolerant Peptostreptococcus species to the genus Streptococcus. Because inconsistencies in the results prevented our differentiating Peptococcus prevotii. Peptococcus magnus, and Peptococcus variabilis by GLC, additional strains will have to been examined. These GLC techniques are amenable to routine use; however, for interlaboratory results to be meaningful, the classification and nomenclature of the anaerobic gram-positive cocci should be standardized.
TI  - Description of strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius isolated from subcutaneous abscesses in cats.
AB  - Strains of Peptostreptococcus, Streptococcus and of a Gram-positive coccus, which was initially isolated as an anaerobe but grew subsequently as a facultative organism, were isolated from subcutaneous abscesses in cats. The cat strains of Peptostreptococcus gave metabolic fermentation products in combinations described for P. anaerobius. The Streptococcus strains conformed to the group S. intermedius. The facultative organism described had the metabolic products of P. anaerobius but the distinctly different biochemical characteristics of S. intermedius and fits neither of the genera strictly.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in semen from fertile and infertile groups  of men.
AB  - Semen samples were collected by masturbation under asceptic conditions from men who had sired children within the past 6 mo (group A) and asymptomatic men attending an infertility clinic who had not sired children and whose wives were asymptomatic for infertility (group B). These 109 semen samples were analyzed and cultured for isolation of aerobic and anerobic organisms. Overall, 68% of the specimens had positive bacterial cultures: 54% of the samples from group A were positive and 73% from group B were positive. Mixed bacterial flora were isolated from both groups but in group B they were more varied and present in a higher colony count than in group A. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staph. aureus, Corynebacterium species, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated from group A. Group B revealed these organisma plus Streptococcus pneumoniae type III, Strep. pyogenes group A, Strep. feacalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Eubacterium species. Semen samples from group A were of better quality than those from group B. In addition, the antibacterial effect of seminal plasma from group A was greater than that from group B.
TI  - Extractable antigen shared by Peptostreptococcus anaerobius strains.
AB  - Extracts from several species of gram-positive cocci were prepared by a modification of the Rantz-Randall autoclave method and tested for reactions with rabbit anti-Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (ATCC 27337 and VPI 5737) sera in a capillary precipitin test. Antigen preparations from two reference strains of P. anaerobius (ATCC 27337 and VPI 5737) and six clinical isolates of P. anaerobius reacted with the P. anaerobius antisera. These extracts formed a line of identity by immunodiffusion and displayed at least one precipitin line by immunoelectrophoresis. Absorption of the antisera with either the autoclaved extract or a 10% whole-cell suspension from each of the eight P. anaerobius strains removed the precipitin line(s) observed during immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis. Extracts prepared to other species of Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, and Streptococcus did not react with the P. anaerobius antisera in a capillary precipitin test. In addition antisera to Lancefield groups A to G did not react with the extracts from the eight P. anaerobius strains. Preliminary chemical analysis of the extracts from the eight strains showed that they contained approximately 0.2 mg of carbohydrate per ml and 3.6 mg of protein per ml. The rabbit anti-P. anaerobius sera used in this study detected a common antigen(s) shared by strains of P. anaerobius, but did not react with autoclave extracts prepared from other species of gram-positive cocci. This extractable antigen could be used in a capillary precipitin test to rapidly identify P. anaerobius strains isolated in the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - Quantitative bacteriology of the vaginal flora in vaginitis.
AB  - Vaginal flora was studied quantitatively in 29 sexually active women, 16 to 33 years of age, to define the role of C. vaginale in vaginitis. Seventeen were asymptomatic and 12 complained of symptoms of vaginitis. Seven asymptomatic women had scant secretions: four of these seven had C. vaginale at log10 6 to 9 CFU per milliliter, none of whom had "clue" cells; none had trichomonas or candida; six had lactobacilli at log10 7 to 9.7 per milliliter; only one had Bacteroidaceae at greater than log10 5 per milliliter. Ten asymptomatic women had easily collectable secretions; eight of 10 had C. vaginale at log10 6.5 to 9.6 per milliliter, three of whom had "clue" cells; four had trichomonas and none candida; nine had Lactobacilli at log10 7 to 9.3 per milliliter; four had Bacteroidaceae at greater than log10 5 per milliliter. Twelve had vaginitis: five of 12 had C. vaginale at log10 7.9 to 11 per milliliter, one of whom had "clue" cells; nine had either trichomonas or candida or both and three had no pathogen, including C. vaginale; 10 had Lactobacilli at log10 7 to 10 per milliliter; six had Bacteriodaceae at greater than log10 5 per milliliter. Three had "clue" cells in absence of C. vaginale.
TI  - [First steps in the bacterial colonization of the digestive tract of neonates (author's transl)].
AB  - Meconium samples obtained from 14 children aged 18 to 51 h were subjected to a quantitative differential analysis. The meconium of one of the children (47 h old) was sterile; in those of the 11 infants aged less than 47 h the dominant flora was composed of either enterobacteria, mainly Escherichia coli sensitive to usual antibiotics, or of streptococci. The genus Acinetobacter constituted the dominant flora in one case only. Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Clostridium (C. perfringens), Bacteroides, Peptococcus, when present in the meconium, represented a very small proportion of the total flora. In the two children aged 48 h and more, the flora was more complex and Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Veillonella, Peptostreptococcus, Clostridium and Staphylococcus were associated to streptococci and enterobacteria. A very small number of lactobacilli was found in one child only. No yeasts were detected. The sequence of establishment of the various bacteria was studied in a child (OG) by an analysis of 8 samples obtained between 0 and 74 h after its birth. E. coli and Streptococcus became established 24 h after parturition, Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides the 2nd and 3rd day, respectively. Lactobacillus and Peptococcus were only present in very low number in the first 2 meconium samples and did not become established in the child, although they were present in a rather large number in the vaginal and faecal samples from the mother. In addition, use of axenic mice inoculated with the 3rd meconium from the infant OG revealed the existence of certain genera of bacteria probably of faecal origin which had not been detected by the direct analysis of the meconium. These genera did not become established in the child. The hypothesis according to which the meconium chooses among the fortuitous contaminations before true colonization of the digestive tract is established, is discussed. It was also observed that the evolution of the ratio between the number of E. coli and Proteus morganii in the successive samples obtained from OG was very different from that observed in the mice inoculated with these samples.
TI  - Identification of Bacteroides fragilis by indirect immunofluorescence.
AB  - Rabbit antiserum against live or heat-killed Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343 bacteria was titrated against hot phenol water-extracted polysaccharide antigens from five different species of the 'B. fragilis group' of bacteria using an enzyme immunoassay and shown to be specific for the B. fragilis NCTC 9343 polysaccharide. When the antiserum was used in indirect immunofluorescence, 97.1% of 244 B. fragilis strains were correctly identified. Only 8 of the other 312 Bacteroides strains were stained by the anti-B fragilis serum. The 'cross-reactive' Bacteriodes strains all belonged to the "B. fragilis group" of bacteria (i.e., B; distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformis, and B. vulgatus). None of the 425 aerobic enteric bacteria representing Salmonella, E. coli, Proteus, Yersinia, Shigella, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Pseudomonas were positive using the anti-B. fragilis serum. Likewise, all the 59 gram-positive strains representing Streptococcus, Bacillus, Peptostreptococcus, Peptococcus, Propionibacterium, Lactobacillus, Eubacterium, and Clostridium did not stain. Our data shows in accordance with other findings [11], that B. fragilis strains possess a species-specific cell envelope antigen(s) which promises to be important for production of antisera, making a rapid identification of the species possible.
TI  - Comparative susceptibilities of anaerobic bacteria to metronidazole, ornidazole,  and SC-28538.
AB  - The susceptibilities of 284 anaerobic bacteria, including 55 strains of the Bacteroides fragilis group, were determined by an agar dilution technique to metronidazole and two newer nitroimidazoles, ornidazole and SC-28538. All three agents showed marked in vitro activity against virtually all anaerobic bacteria tested. At concentrations </=1 mug/ml, SC-28538 was significantly more active than either metronidazole or ornidazole. At concentrations of >1 mug/ml, the activities of all three agents were comparable. Propionibacterium and Actinomyces showed significant resistance to all three agents. Anaerobic and microaerophilic members of the genus Streptococcus were also often resistant, in contrast to Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus strains. In addition, the bactericidal activities of ornidazole and SC-28538 were determined against 27 strains of the B. fragilis group by a broth dilution technique. The minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal concentrations of each agent were very close. At concentrations of </=0.5 mug/ml, SC-28538 showed greater bactericidal activity; at concentrations of >/=2 mug/ml, the activies of both agents were similar.
TI  - Anaerobic microflora of the vagina in children.
AB  - Vaginal cultures from 25 healthy girls from two months to 15 years of age were examined for aerobic, facultatively anaerobic, and obligately anaerobic bacteria. An average of 8.7 species (3.7 aerobic and facultatively anaerobic species; 5.3 obligately anaerobic species) were isolated from these cultures. Staphylococcus epidermidis (21), diphtheroids (20), bacteroides (19), peptococci (19), peptostreptococci (14), and Bacteroides melaninogenicus (14) were most prevalent organisms.
TI  - A new hydrolase specific for taurine-conjugates of bile acids.
AB  - Through the investigation of the bile acid-deconjugation activities of human intestinal anaerobes, a new enzyme was discovered in Peptostreptococcus intermedius which hydrolyzed specifically the taurine-conjugates, but not the glycine-conjugates of bile acids. However, the enzymes in Streptococcus faecalis and Lactobacillus brevis hydrolyzed chiefly the glycine-conjugates.
TI  - Microbiota of gingivitis in man.
AB  - A study on the predominant cultivable microorganisms inhabiting gingival crevices affected with a chronic gingivitis was carried out using the roll tube culture technique. Samples were obtained from nine individuals 25--42 years of age. Gram-positive rods make up 29.1% of the isolates and included mainly Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces israelii, and Actinomyces viscosus. Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis together made up 26.8% of the cultivable organisms. Peptostreptococcus averaged 3.0% of the organisms recovered. Gram-negative anaerobic rods constituted 25.0% of the total isolates with Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides melaninogenicus ss. intermedius. Bacteriodes ochraceus, other Bacteroides species, Selenomonas sputigena, and Campylobacter sputorum as the most predominant isolates. Haemophilus parainfluenzae averaged about 14% and Veillonella species 4.3% of the cultivable microflora. The data presented indicate that the subgingival microflora of a chronic gingivitis differs from those of healthy periodontium and advanced adult and juvenile periodontis. This might suggest that different infectious processes may be operative in various clinical entities of periodontal disease.
TI  - Clindamycin-induced enterocolitis in hamsters.
AB  - A lethal enterocolitis was induced in hamsters by oral or parenteral administration of clindamycin in amounts comparable to those used in treatment of humans. The intestinal lesions were characterized histologically as an acute inflammatory reaction with pseudomembrane formation and resembled the lesions seen in humans with antibiotic-induced colitis. Results of quantitative stool cultures showed the numbers of Peptostreptococcus and Corynebacterium decreased in animals with colitis after challenge with 100 mg of clindamycin/kg, while numbers of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, and clindamycin-resistant Clostridium sordellii and Clostridium difficile increased. Bacteria were not seen within the intestinal lesions. Viruses were not isolated from hamsters with colitis. Although the pathogenesis of this syndrome is not completely established, the evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that the disease is caused by clostridial toxins and that the production of these toxins by organisms within the intestines is enhanced by the effects of clindamycin upon the bowel flora.
TI  - Serological reactions of the genus Peptostreptococcus.
AB  - White male New Zealand rabbits were immunized with soluble antigen preparations (SP) of the following gram-positive anaerobic cocci: Peptostreptococcus anaerobius ATCC 27337 and VPI 5737; P. micros VPI 2618; Streptococcus morbillorum ATCC 27527; P. parvulus VPI 5229; and P. productus ATCC 27340. SP were reacted with homologous and heterologous rabbit antisera in immunodiffusion, immunoelectrophoresis, indirect fluorescent-antibody, and tanned-cell passive hemagglutination tests. Even though each antiserum reacted strongly with its homologous SP, no interspecies reactivity was observed except between P. productus antisera and P. parvulus SP by the passive hemagglutination test. Antisera prepared to both strains of P. anaerobius reacted with the other strain in all serological tests.

TI  - Bacteriological findings in cultures of clinical material from Bartholin's abscess.
AB  - Purulent exudate from 28 cases of Bartholin's abscess were examined for aerobic,  anaerobic, and microaerophilic bacteria. Three cases gave no bacterial growth, five cases grew facultative bacteria only, and a further three grew a mixture of facultative and anaerobic bacteria. One case gave a pure growth of a microaerophilic streptococcus. Anaerobic bacteria were the only isolates in 16 cases and Bacteroides species were the most common organisms isolated; they were present as 62.5% of the total anaerobes cultured and accounted for 45.4% of the total bacteria cultured. Escherichia coli was the most common of the facultative organisms, accounting for 18% of the total bacteria. Most infections seemed to be caused by a single organism, anaerobic types predominating.
TI  - Neonatal scalp abscess and fetal monitoring: factors associated with infection.
AB  - Forty-two of 929 (4.5 per cent) newborn infants prospectively studied following continuous, direct fetal heart rate monitoring during labor developed a scalp abscess at the site of electrode application during the neonatal period. Factors associated with infection with the use of a multivariate analysis were duration of monitoring (p less than 0.01) and high-risk indications for monitoring (p less than 0.01). Of the 42 infected neonates, 33 had complete bacteriologic studies. Microorganisms were isolated from all the infection tended to be polymicrobial, most commonly containing both aerobes and anaerobes. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, and Peptococcus were the predominant isolates. These data indicate that scalp abscess complicating intrapartum fetal monitoring may be nosocomial importance, and infants monitored should be closely observed in order to prevent more serious infectious complications.
TI  - Bacteriology of necrotizing fasciitis.
AB  - Sixteen patients with necrotizing fasciitis were observed under clinical and laboratory conditions for collection, preservation, and culture that permitted optimal retrieval of anaerobes. The clinical observations of necrosis of fascia, subcutaneous fat and skin with thrombosis of the microvasculature, and absence of myonecrosis were clearly apparent in these patients. Two clear-cut groups of culture and gram stain results were found, suggesting that the clinical entity of necrotizing fasciitis can occur after infection by different infecting organisms. The cultivation of Streptococcus pyogenes (group A), either alone or in combination with staphylococcus, in three patients conforms to the culture results found by Meleney [1] in his original description.
TI  - [Fecal flora of man. V. communication: The fluctuation of the fecal flora of the  healthy adult (author's transl)].
AB  - Seven fecal specimens from each of healthy persons, aged 25 to 42 years, during the period of 2 months were analyzed to obtain the knowledge on the day-to-day variation in the same person and the person-to-person variation. Irrespective of individuals, bacteroidaceae, catenabacteria (eubacteria and strict anaerobic lactobacilli), peptostreptococci (anaerobic gram positive cocci) and bifidobacteria constituted the predominant flora. Spirillaceae, megasphaerae and clostridia (except Cl. perfringens) were also found as predominant flora in specific individuals. In all cases, enterobacteria and streptococci constitute the accompanying flora. In addition, veillonallae and lactobacilli were found as predominant flora in most cases. The remaining flora, consisting of Cl. perfringens, staphylococci and yeast, occurred occasionally in low numbers. With regard to the composition of the fecal flora of each person, a great individual variation was recognized and confirmed statistically. Each person had a characteristic fecal flora. In the same person, the numbers of bacteria of the predominating flora were over a 2 months period relatively constant. On the other hand, a great day-to-day variation in the numbers of bacteria of the accompanying flora as well as the remaining flora was demonstrated.
TI  - Urease assay and urease-producing species of anaerobes in the bovine rumen and human feces.
AB  - A growth medium and test were developed for rapid detection of urease in fermentative anaerobic bacteria. Using nonselective rumen fluid roll-tube agar medium and the new test, it was confirmed that Peptostreptococcus productus is often the most numerous urease-forming species in human feces. Also, some fecal strains of Ruminococcus albus, Clostridium innocuum, and Clostridium beijerinckii produced urease. Single strains of Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Coprococcus catus, and Streptococcus mitis that were strongly ureolytic on isolation later lost this ability. Urease activity was also detected in many strains of nonselectively isolated rumen species. They include Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, Treponema sp., Ruminococcus bromii (not previously known to be present in the rumen), Butyrivibrio sp., Bifidobacterium sp., Bacteroides ruminicola, and P. productus. Most P. productus strains contain urease; however, the uniformity of this feature in the other species noted above is not known. The urease in many of these species was not detected if the growth medium contained 0.2% or more (each) yeast extract and Trypticase.
TI  - [Growth of non-sporing anaerobes in an oxygen-free blood culture system (author's transl)].
AB  - The efficacy of the commercially available Vacutainer blood culture system to support the growth of non-sporing anaerobes was compared with two laboratory-prepared blood culture media (supplemented thioglycollate medium and brain heart infusion). The media were inoculated with 10, 100 and 1000 organisms of the species tested, and the number of colony-forming units was determined at intervals of 8-10 hrs. Analogous experiments were performed with batches of the media to which 10% vol/vol of human blood had been added. From the results obtained with strains of Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides splanchnicus, Sphaerophorus necrophorus, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Propionibacterium acnes it became obvious that growth of non-sporing anaerobes was significantly enhanced in the Vacutainer culture tubes, whereas Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcus spp. grew equally well in all the media tested.

TI  - Numbers and types of anaerobic bacteria isolated from clinical specimens since 1960.
AB  - Between 1960 and 1974, 826 specimens, excluding stool, urine, sputum, and blood,  yielded 689 (83%) positive cultures, of which 403 (58.5%) contained anaerobic bacteria. This represents 48.8% of the total specimens cultured. Isolates from 153 specimens obtained and stocked from 1965 to 1974 were reidentified by current criteria. Gram-negative bacilli, primarily bacteroides, were the most frequently isolated anaerobes, being found in 70% of 153 anaerobe-positive specimens and accounting for 42% of the total anaerobes isolated. Gram-positive cocci were second in occurrence, being found in 66% of 153 specimens and accounting for 40% of the total isolates. Bacteroides fragilis was by far the most frequently isolated species. Compairson of 14 years of cumulative data with data from current studies covering 1- to 2-year periods indicated that the anaerobes isolated from clinical material have not changed significantly in type or relative numbers.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of tinidazole. An in vitro comparison of the effects of tinidazole and metronidazole against Bacteroides fragilis and other Anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The new antiprotozoal agent, tinidazole, was found to be bactericidal against all 52 isolates of obligate anaerobic bacteria tested, 42 Bacteroides fragilis, 4 clostridia and 6 peptostreptococci. The minimum bactericidal concentrations of tinidazole for B. fragilis ranged from 0.25 to 4 mug/ml, and those of metronidazole from 0.25 to 8 mug/ml, i.e. several times lower than the serum concentrations achievable after oral administration. In most cases the MIC was identical with MBC or half of it. On the average, tinidazole was slightly more effective against B. fragilis than metronidazole. Although essentially the activities of the two drugs were positively correlated, there was a fourfold difference in their MBC for 10 of the 42 B. fragilis.
TI  - Bacterial interference by oropharynegeal and clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Anaerobic isolates were tested for bacterial inhibitory activity. Of 144 isolates, 102 were from oropharynegeal washings, and 42 were from clinical specimens. Thirteen facultative bacterial species (seven members of the Enterobacteriaceae and six species of gram-positive cocci) were used as indicators of inhibition. Eleven anaerobic species were isolated from oral secretions. All isolates of Bacteroides melaninogenicus, the most commonly recovered species, consistently inhibited several species of indicator bacteria. Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides oralis, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius had unprecictable inhibitory activity, whereas most of the other oral anaerobes were noninhibitory. The 42 clinical species were generally noninhibitory.
TI  - A bacteriological study of the intestinal mucosa and luminal fluid of adults with acute diarrhoea.
AB  - Bacteriological studies of jejunal mucosal biopsy specimens and contents were performed on 22 hospitalized adult patients with acute diarrhoea and 24 control normal subjects. None of the washed homogenates of the mucosal specimens were sterile and only one fluid specimen obtained from a control subject was sterile. A definite enteric pathogen was found in only five of the 22 diarrhoea patients. There was no qualitative difference in the bacterial profile of the jejunal mucosa and contents of the diarrhoea patients from that of the control subjects, but there were significant quantitative differences for some bacterial categories. In the control as well as diarrhoea subjects, there was no qualitative difference in the bacterial profile of the jejunal mucosa from that of the fluid, but there were significant quantitative differences for some bacterial categories. The significance of the findings is discussed.
TI  - Anaerobic streptococcal corneal ulcer.
AB  - An anaerobic streptococcus caused a central corneal ulcer in a 10-year-old girl.  There were no identifying clinical findings. The lesion healed promptly and satisfactorily with antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Evaluation of amniotic fluid for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Studies of 117 pregnant women, 83 at term, were instituted to determine the bacteriologic state of amniotic fluid, utilizing both standard aerobic and anaerobic technics. A high association of postpartum infection was found in women who had long periods of premature reptured membranes and many vaginal examinations. Significant organisms including anaerobes, were isolated in many of these instances. Based on the findings of these studies, it is recommended that amniocentesis for aerobic and anaerobic cultures be done when membranes have been ruptured for 8 hours or more, and when the patient has had seven or more vaginal examinations during the course of labor.
TI  - The elimination of urease activity in Streptococcus faecium as evidence for plasmid-coded urease.
AB  - A strain of Streptococcus faecium from the sheep rumen showed spontaneous loss of urease activity when subcultured at the normal rumen temperature of 38 degrees C, although in mixed cultures in vivo or in vitro loss of urease was not apparent. The rate of loss of urease in pure cultures was increased at incubation temperatures above 38 degrees C, but loss was never complete. However, at temperatures below 38 degrees C loss was greater, and at 22 or 18 degrees C the urease was completely eliminated. Incubation with sodium dodecyl sulphate (0-002%) or ethidium bromide (2-5 X 10(-5)M) caused complete loss of urease activity. The urease activity was also eliminated when the streptococcus was grown aerobically, and this loss of activity was irreversible. It is suggested that the urease activity is controlled by a plasmid gene and that aeration, low growth temperature and chemical agents 'cure' the streptococcus of the plasmid. Attempts to demonstrate the presence of covalently closed circular extrachromosomal DNA by caesium chloride-ethidium bromide equilibrium density-gradient centrifugation were unsuccessful.
TI  - Bacteriological findings in sinusitis (1963-1975).
AB  - Two different studies were performed in order to determine the role of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in sinusitis. Aerobes: A retrospective study of 331 cases of all types of sinusitis (from 1963 till 1975) showed an increasing occurrence of Haemophilus influenzae during the last three years. Only in the acute sinusitis is Streptococcus pneumoniae more frequently found than Haemophilus influenzae, which exhibits the highest occurrence in chronic and undeterminable cases. We found cultures with pathogenic aerobes in 64% of the acute and 56% of the chronic cases of sinusitis. Anaerobes: A prospective study of 100 sinus secretions from 66 patients with paranasal sinusitis showed the great importance of anaerobes; they were present in 33% of samples, pure anaerobic cultures in 12% and mixed aerobic-anaerobic in 21%. Peptostreptococcus sp. showed the highest occurrence (15%). Anaerobic sinusitis is more frequent in unilateral cases. The presence of anaerobes is not dependent on the patient's age or the duration of the sinusitis. In 76% the anaerobes disappeared after the initial antral irrigation.
TI  - The predominant cultivable organisms in juvenile periodontitis.
AB  - Quantitative and qualitative examinations of the predominant cultivable microflora of the advanced tissue destruction (pocket) associated with juvenile periodontitis and of control pockets without loss of attachment were carried out by using anaerobic tube culture technique. The microflora from the control sites consisted primarily of streptococci, Gram-negative rods, and Gram-positive rods. In contrast, the test pockets had a relatively stable and characteristic microflora, dominated by various Gram-negative, anaerobic rods. The Gram-negative rods were divided into main groups, but a satisfactory classification of many of these microorganisms could not be performed with the methods used and the data available. The predominating Gram-negative rods differed from individual to individual. The role of the Gram-negative rods in the etiology of juvenile periodontitis is unknown. Some potential pathogenic mechanisms of these microorganisms are discussed.
TI  - Anaerobic specimen transport device.
AB  - A device is described and evaluated for the anaerobic transport of clinical specimens. The device limits the amount of oxygen entering with the sample to a maximum of 2%, which is rapidly removed by reacting with hydrogen in the presence of a palladium catalyst. The viability on swabs of 12 species of anaerobes, four strains of facultative anaerobes and a strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was maintained during the length of the tests (24 or 48 h). The results demonstrated that this device protected even the more oxygen-sensitive clinical anaerobes from death due to oxygen exposure. This device can be used for swabs as well as for anaerobic collection and liquid and solid specimens.
TI  - The bacteriology of acute pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  - The bacteriology of acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) was studied in 20 patients by simultaneous cul-de-sac, cervical, and blood cultures with aerobic and fastidious anaerobic techniques. Cul-de-sac cultures were positive in 18 of 20 patients, while all 8 normal control subjects yielded negative results (p less than 0.0005, chi-square analysis). Anaerobic bacteria (predominatly Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus) were present in 10 patients (59 per cent), and they were the exclusive isolates in 3 patients. N. gonorrhoeae was isolated only once from the cul-de-sac despite its presence in cervical specimens. There was poor correlation between cul-de-sac and cervical cultures. Cervical cultures yielded a variety of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with an average of 3.8 organisms per specimen. N. gonorrhoeae was isolated in 13 patients (65 per cent). Only 19 per cent of cervical isolates were recovered by culdocentesis; similarly, only 31 per cent of cul-de-sac isolates were simultaneously isolated from the cervix. Blood cultures were uniformly negative. These data suggest that: (1) culdocentesis is a reliable technique for the bacteriologic diagnosis of acute PID, and (2) whereas the gonococcus may be important in initiating acute PID, its primary role appears to be paving the way for secondary invaders from the normal vaginal flora to gain access to the upper genital tract.
TI  - Evaluation of bacteriological transport systems.
AB  - Seven commercially manufactured bacteriological transport systems, including Culturette, Trans-Cul (with Stuart and Amies), Handiswab, Securline (with Amies and Amies without charcoal) and Culture Caddy, were evaluated to determine whether these systems were capable of maintaining the viability and constant numbers of mixtures of hardy, fastidious and anaerobic organisms over 72 hours at 25C and 4C. The results of the study indicated that if specimens are maintained in transport systems at 25C they should be cultured at four hours to minimize loss of viability and to assure accurate quantitation. No one transport system excelled over the other for maintenance of cultures at room temperature. Most organisms survived well in all of the transport systems for 72 hours when refrigerated.

TI  - Puerperal endometritis: a prospective microbiologic study.
AB  - This study was undertaken to determine the flora in the endometrial cavity of two groups of puerperal patients: 47 afebrile control subjects and 27 with endometritis. A transcervical culturing technique designed to avoid cervical contamination and to preserve aerobes, anaerobes, and mycoplasma was employed, and bacterial colony counts were reported semiquantitatively. No difference was found in the flora of these two groups. Furthermore, the most common pathogenic organisms (in decreasing order of frequency) were peptostreptococci, peptococci, Bacteroides sp., gamma-streptococci, enterococci, beta-streptococci, alpha-streptococci, and E. coli.
TI  - Prophylactic antibiotics in cesarean section.
AB  - Using a random selection procedure, 100 patients were evaluated in order to determine the value of prophylactic antibiotics in cesarean section. All patients were evaluated for febrile morbidity, and specific infection sites were recorded. Significant differences were found between the treated and control groups and between cesarean sections performed prior to the onset of labor and after the onset of labor.
TI  - Bacteriology of normal and infected conjunctiva.
AB  - The conjunctivas of 273 inflamed eyes were cultured by both aerobic and anaerobic techniques. Isolations were obtained from 267 (97.8%) of the eyes. Aerobic organisms were isolated from 237 (86.8%) of the conjunctivas. Staphylococcus aureus from 63 (23.1%) of the diseased eyes was the aerobic pathogen most often isolated. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 172 (63.0%) of the conjunctivas. Propionibacterium acnes was isolated from 126 (46.2%) of the conjunctivas, and Peptostreptococcus species were isolated from 80 (29.3%) of the conjunctivas. Comparison with the bacteriology of 96 normal eyes showed that anaerobes play a much greater role as etiological agents of conjunctivitis than formerly believed. When anaerobic bacteria were isolated, they appeared on the average in 7 days, indicating that they may be missed by ordinary bacteriological culturing.
TI  - Acute pelvic inflammatory disease and clinical response to parenteral doxycycline.
AB  - The bacteriology of acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and clinical response to parenteral doxycycline were evaluated in 30 patients. Only 3 of 21 cul-de-sac cultures from PID patients were sterile, whereas all 8 normal control subjects yielded negative results (P< 0.005). Poor correlation was observed between cervical and cul-de-sac cultures. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, isolated from the cervix in 17 patients (57%), was recovered from the cul-de-sac only once. Streptococcus, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, coliforms, and other organisms normally present in the vagina were the predominant isolates recovered from the cul-de-sac. Parenteral doxycycline resulted in rapid resolution of signs and symptoms (within 48 h) in 20 of 27 evaluable patients (74%). In five others, signs and symptoms of infection abated within 4 days. The remaining two patients failed to respond; in both cases, adnexal masses developed during doxycycline therapy. Gonococci were eradicated from the cervix in all but one patient who, nevertheless, had a rapid defervescence of symptoms. There was no clear-cut correlation between the clinical response and in vitro susceptibility of cul-de-sac isolates to doxycycline. These data confirm the usefulness of broad-spectrum antibiotics in acute PID. Culdocentesis is a reliable means of obtaining material for the bacteriological diagnosis of acute PID; however, the pathogenetic role and relative importance of gonococci and various other bacteria in acute PID need to be clarified further.
TI  - Survival of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria on cotton swabs in three transport systems.
AB  - The capacity of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to survive on cotton swabs placed  into a dry gassed-out CO2-filled tube (DGT), dry sterile aerobic tube (DAT), and a tube containing a modified Stuarts' transport medium (MST), was assessed. Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in numbers by 2 and 3 logs when stored in MST and DAT, respectively. The viability of P. aeruginosa, although retarded when compared to MSA and DAT, was not adversely affected by the CO2 environment in the DGT. The MST maintained relatively constant numbers of Streptococcus pyogenes during the 48-h storage period. The DAT and the DGT were unable to maintain the viability of S. pyogenes. Staphylococcus aureus, when stored in a DGT, DAT, or MST, was maintained in relatively constant numbers throughout the entire storage period. Of the four anaerobic bacteria evaluated (Bacteroides fragilis ssp. thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides melaninogenicus ssp. asaccharolyticus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius), only B. fragilis ssp. thetaiotamicron survived the 48-h storage period in the DGT. Under these test conditions the DGT did not adequately maintain the viability of the majority of anaerobic bacteria tested (when held on cotton swabs). However, the MST did maintain the viability of all species tested for at least the first 2 h of storage.

TI  - Role of anaerobic bacteria in subdural empyema. Report of four cases and review of 327 cases from the English literature.
AB  - Anaerobic bacteria were isolated from the subdural space in all four cases of subdural empyema encountered over a 2 and a half year period. Only one aerobe was isolated in these cases. The bacteriology of subdural empyema was further analyzed from a review of 327 cases reported in the English literature. Anaerobes accounted for 12 per cent of 234 cases; In addition, 27 per cent of cases were reportedly "sterile." These data support our finding that anaerobic bacteria may play a far more important role in subdural empyema than was previously appreciated.

AB  - Both prereduced molten agar and broth and aerobic molten agar and broth were inoculated with blood samples collected from patients with periodontitis, but in otherwise good health, both before and after extraction of two or more teeth. Postoperative blood samples from 23 of 25 patients sampled yielded anaerobic and facultative species. Colony counts from nine samples yielded from less than 1 to over 100 colonies per ml of blood. Organisms detected were species belonging to the genera Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Leptotrichia, Propionibacterium, Peptococcus, Veillonella, plus Streptococcus mitis, S. salivarius, vibrio forms, and strains resembling S. mutans. The data indicate that prereduced anaerobically sterilized culture medium with polyanethol sulfonate is effective for detecting anaerobic species in bacteremia and that anaerobic species can be prevalent in bacteremias immediately after tooth extraction in patients with periodontitis.
TI  - Stomach fermentation in East African Colobus monkeys in their natural state.
AB  - The microbial fermentation in the stomachs of two monkeys, Colobus polykomos, collected in Kenya, was studied. The gas accumulated within the stomach contained H(2) but no CH(4). Volatile fatty acid concentrations were high, but accumulated acid prevented determination of the fermentation rate in untreated, incubated stomach contents. Upon addition of bicarbonate, a very rapid rate could be demonstrated. Some D- and L-lactate were in the stomach contents. Starchy seeds or fruits rather than leaves appeared to have been consumed. Microscopically, the most prominent microorganisms seen were large, very refringent cocci, possibly Sarcina ventriculi, and various smaller cocci and rods. The 28 cultured strains of bacteria included 14 Staphylococcus, 2 Streptococcus, 10 Propionibacterium, and 2 Peptostreptococcus. The culture count constituted 10 to 20% of the direct count. No protozoa or cellulolytic bacteria were found.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  - Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, Eh < -42 mV at pH 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic PMN. Anaerobic PMN were able to kill Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, viridans streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Peptococcus magnus normally. Organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic PMN included Staphylococcus aureus (strains Wood 46 and 502a), Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Salmonella typhimurium. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide may be important in the killing of some bacteria.

TI  - Comparison of methods for isolation of anaerobic bacteria from clinical specimens.
AB  - Five different anaerobic culture methods and several different media were compared for their ability to recover anaerobes from clinical specimens. Specimens were obtained from patients with documented infections, avoiding contamination with normal flora, and immediately placed in an anaerobic transporter. Each specimen was cultured by all methods and on all the various media. The comparative data indicate that anaerobic jars (GasPak and evacuation-replacement types) are just as effective in the recovery of clinically significant anaerobes as the more complex roll-tube and chamber methods employing prereduced media. Liquid media were disappointing as a "back-up" system but chopped-meat glucose was superior to two thioglycolate formulations. Growth of all anaerobes was poorer on selective media, but these media were very helpful in the workup of specimens containing mixed growth of anaerobic and facultative organisms. A variety of different anaerobes was isolated, but no very fastidious or extremely oxygen-sensitive organisms were recovered. This suggests that such organisms may not play a significant role in causing clinical infections.

TI  - Ruminal bacterial degradation of benzo(b)-thien-4-yl methylcarbamate (Mobam) and  effect of Mobam on ruminal bacteria.
AB  - Mixtures of ruminal bacteria degraded benzo(b)thien-4-yl methylcarbamate (Mobam)  to 4-hydroxybenzothiophene, CO(2), and polar product(s). The metabolite, 4-hydroxybenzothiophene, was identified (after acetylation) by comparative infrared and mass spectrometry with an authentic sample. Carbon dioxide and polar product(s) were produced by degradation of the methylcarbamate moiety. Ten previously characterized strains of ruminal bacteria with diverse physiological capabilities did not degrade Mobam. However, three tributyrin-hydrolyzing strains were isolated that did degrade Mobam. Mobam inhibited growth of two of ten strains isolated on Mobam-free glycerol-tributyrin enrichment medium. One of these strains was also sensitive to 2-carbomethoxy-propene-2yl dimethyl phosphate (Phosdrin). Mobam prevented some ruminal bacteria from producing zones of hydrolysis in tributyrin emulsion media and inhibited some ruminal bacteria from degrading 1-naphthyl acetate and fluorescein-3',6'-diacetate.

Bacteriol. 92:1321-1330. 1966.-The activities of enzymes representing the major pathways of carbohydrate metabolism and anaerobic electron transport in cell-free extracts of whole rumen contents have been reported. The effects of diet upon the activities of several enzymes suggested that enzymatic measurements might prove useful for the study of rumen metabolism. In the present study, the distribution and characteristics of aldolase, succinate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, lactyl-coenzyme A dehydrase, lactate dehydrogenase, and other enzymes were measured in cell-free extracts of pure cultures of Ruminococcus flavefaciens, R. albus, Bacteroides succinogenes, B. ruminicola, B. amylophilus, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Peptostreptococcus elsdenii, Streptococcus bovis, and Selenomonas ruminantium. Some enzymes were widely distributed (aldolase, glutamate dehydrogenase), whereas others were observed in one or two species (lactyl-coenzyme A dehydrase). The cofactor requirements and kinetic characteristics of enzymes varied considerably with species. Enzymes that vary with species might be employed as indices for estimating the activities of various groups of microorganisms in whole rumen contents.

Bacteriol. 88:1316-1323. 1964.-Thirteen strains of bacteria indigenous to the gingival crevice area of man were tested for their ability to establish as monocontaminants in germ-free mice. Three facultative organisms, Streptococcus mitis, Staphylococcus albus, and a "diphtheroid," established, as well as three anaerobes. Fusobacterium fusiforme, an anaerobic diphtheroid, and a Bacteroides strain. Seven other anaerobes (two strains of B. melaninogenicus, and one strain each of Treponema microdentium, Veillonella alcalescens, a Peptostreptococcus strain, Vibrio sputorum, and B. oralis) failed to establish. A mixture consisting of ten organisms representative of the predominant groups of cultivable bacteria present in the gingival crevice area of man was inoculated intraorally into germ-free mice. All organisms with the exception of B. melaninogenicus and T. microdentium became established as polycontaminants. Escherichia coli could be established in the above polycontaminated mice, as well as in those contaminated directly with human gingival debris. E. coli comprised approximately 50 and 6% of the fecal flora in the two groups, respectively. Diet, cecal contents, and feces of germ-free and polycontaminated mice were tested for inhibitory action against T. microdentium and B. melaninogenicus. None inhibited T. microdentium, whereas all three inhibited B. melaninogenicus. The inhibitory effect appeared to be due to dietary alfalfa. B. melaninogenicus could become established in mice monocontaminated with a facultative diptheroid and maintained on an alfalfa-free diet. These experiments indicate that human indigenous bacteria can become established in germ-free mice, and that microbial interactions and diet composition are important determinants.

Bacteriol. 85:1114-1120. 1963.-The metabolism of molecular hydrogen by Clostridium pasteurianum, Micrococcus lactilyticus (Veillonella alcalescens), and several other anaerobic bacteria was studied. Oxidation of hydrogen, using several electron-accepting substrates including triphosphopyridine nucleotide, uric acid, xanthine, nitrite, and hydroxylamine, required ferredoxin in conjunction with hydrogenase. Evolution of hydrogen from pyruvate, alpha-ketoglutarate, hypoxanthine, and dithionite was mediated by ferredoxin. On the basis of these findings, a unitary hypothesis for biological hydrogen evolution is proposed in which ferredoxin plays a key role.
