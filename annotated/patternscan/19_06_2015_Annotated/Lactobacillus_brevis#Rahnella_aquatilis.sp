TI  == effects of ensiling fermentation and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community in italian ryegrass, guinea grass, and whole-crop maize silages stored  at high moisture content.
AB  == the effects of storage period and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community were examined in italian ryegrass (ir), guinea grass (gg), and whole-crop maize (wm) silages. direct-cut forages were stored in a laboratory silo for 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 120 d without any additives; live counts, content  of fermentation products, and characteristics of the bacterial community were determined. 2,3-butanediol, acetic acid, and lactic acid were the dominant fermentation products in the ir, gg, and wm silages, respectively. the acetic acid content increased as a result of prolonged ensiling, regardless of the type  of silage crop, and the changes were distinctively visible from the beginning of  gg ensiling. pantoea agglomerans, rahnella aquatilis, and enterobacter sp. were the major bacteria in the ir silage, indicating that alcoholic fermentation may be due to the activity of enterobacteria. staphylococcus sciuri and bacillus pumilus were detected when ir silage was spoiled, whereas between aerobically stable and unstable silages, no differences were seen in the bacterial community  at silo opening. lactococcus lactis was a representative bacterium, although acetic acid was the major fermentation product in the gg silage. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and morganella morganii were suggested to be associated with the increase in acetic acid due to prolonged storage. enterobacter cloacae appeared when the gg silage was spoiled. in the wm silage, no distinctive changes due to prolonged ensiling were seen in the bacterial community. throughout the ensiling, weissella paramesenteroides, weissella confusa, and klebsiella pneumoniae were present in addition to l. plantarum, l. brevis, and l. lactis. upon deterioration, acetobacter pasteurianus, klebsiella variicola, enterobacter hormaechei, and bacillus gibsonii were detected. these results demonstrate the diverse bacterial community that evolves during ensiling  and aerobic spoilage of ir, gg, and wm silages.

TI  == bacterial and fungal communities of wilted italian ryegrass silage inoculated with and without lactobacillus rhamnosus or lactobacillus buchneri.
AB  == aims: to understand the effects of lactic acid bacteria (lab) inoculation on fermentation products, aerobic stability and microbial communities of silage. methods and results: wilted italian ryegrass was stored in laboratory silos with  and without inoculation of lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus buchneri. the silos were opened after 14, 56 and 120 days and then subjected to aerobic deterioration for 7 days. intensive alcoholic fermentation was found in untreated silage; the sum of ethanol and 2,3-butanediol content at day 14 was about 7 times higher than that of lactic and volatile fatty acids. alcoholic fermentation was suppressed by l. rhamnosus and l. buchneri inoculation and lactic acid and acetic acid became the dominant fermentation products, respectively. silages were deteriorated in untreated and l. rhamnosus-inoculated silages, whereas no spoilage was found in l. buchneri-inoculated silage. enterobacteria such as erwinia persicina, pantoea agglomerans and rahnella aquatilis were detected in untreated silage, whereas some of these bacteria disappeared or became faint with l. rhamnosus treatment. when silage was deteriorated, lactobacillus brevis and bacillus pumilus were observed in untreated and l. rhamnosus-inoculated communities, respectively. the inoculated lab species was detectable in addition  to untreated bacterial communities. saccharomyces cerevisiae and pichia anomala were the main fungi in untreated and l. rhamnosus-inoculated silages; however, p. anomala was not visibly seen in l. buchneri-inoculated silage either at silo opening or after exposure to air. conclusion: inoculation with l. rhamnosus can suppress alcoholic fermentation of wilted grass silage with elimination of enterobacteria at the beginning of fermentation. addition of l. buchneri may improve aerobic stability, with distinct inhibitory effect observed on p. anomala after silo opening. significance and impact of the study: bacterial and fungal community analyses help us to understand how inoculated lab can function to improve the fermentation and aerobic stability of silage.
