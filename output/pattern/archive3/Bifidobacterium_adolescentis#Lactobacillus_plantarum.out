the role of components of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus in pathogenesis and serologic diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid diseases.
during recent years, researchers have been focusing on the concept of an infectious etiology of autoimmune diseases. the most discussed theory is molecular mimicry, i.e. the emergence of autoreactive clones of t- and b-lymphocytes as a result of cross-immune response to homologous bacterial or viral antigen. information on the role of probiotic microorganisms (pm) in the molecular mechanisms of autoimmune thyroid diseases (atd) is limited. using proteins and immunogenic peptides databanks and relevant computer programs, the homology between the amino acid sequences of thyroid peroxidase (tpo) and thyroglobulin (tg), which are potential b- and t-cell epitopes of these antigens, and proteins of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli was established. moreover, we have found components of cells of bifidobacterium bifidum 791, bifidobacterium adolescentis 94 bim, bifidobacterium longum b379m and lactobacillus plantarum b-01 that selectively bind human antibodies to tpo (anti-tpo) and antibodies to tg (anti-tg) and compete with natural antigens for the binding of anti-tpo and anti-tg in elisa. additionally, a three-fold difference was observed between the probability of detecting antibodies (abs) to the antigens of l. plantarum b-01 and b. bifidum 791 in serum samples containing and those not containing anti-tpo. on the whole, our data are arguments in favour of the assumption of the possible role of pm of the genera bifidobacterium and lactobacillus in triggering atd by the mechanism of molecular mimicry. the data obtained in silico and in vitro should be proven by use of animal models and clinical studies for extrapolations to the whole body. possible antigenic properties of components/proteins of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, selectively binding anti-tpo and anti-tg should be taken into consideration. natural human abs to these bacterial components are probably able to cross-react with the tpo and tg in the elisa for detection of anti-tpo and anti-tg, which are serologic markers of atd. it can lead to unspecific false positive results and, hence, to an incorrect diagnosis.
molecular characterization of native isolates of lactic acid bacteria, bifidobacteria and yeasts for beneficial attributes.
in a changing scenario of food habits being associated with wellness factors through the concepts of probiotics and prebiotics, an attempt has been made to characterize on molecular basis, the desirable benefits associated with natural isolates of lactic acid bacteria, bifidobacteria, and yeasts. from a diverse range of foods and related samples, based on conventional microbiological protocols, three well-characterized natural isolates of lactobacillus plantarum mtcc 5422, bifidobacterium adolescentis mtcc 5423 and saccharomyces cerevisiae mtcc 5421 were selected. the cultures of l. plantarum and b. adolescentis showed positive polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification with oligonucleotide primers targeting genus-specific 16 s rrna for lactobacillus and fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase for bifidobacterium. similarly, species-specific positive amplification in pcr was observed with primers of phytase (acid phosphatase) in s. cerevisiae and alpha-d: -galactosidase and bile salt hydrolase in l. plantarum and b. adolescentis. the cultures of l. plantarum and b. adolescentis exhibited a broad spectrum antibacterial activity against selected foodborne pathogenic bacterial species and tolerance to acid and bile. gene sequence of respective pcr-amplified products confirmed the genetic identity of the isolated cultures as l. plantarum and b. adolescentis showing 99% homology with the documented sequence of established gene bank.
