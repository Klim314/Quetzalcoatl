TI  - Subdoligranulum variabile gen. nov., sp. nov. from human feces.
AB  - During studies on the microflora of human feces we have isolated a strictly anaerobic, non-spore-forming, Gram-negative staining organism which exhibits a somewhat variable coccus-shaped morphology. Comparative 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing studies show the unidentified organism is phylogenetically a member of the Clostridium leptum supra-generic rRNA cluster and displays a close affinity to some rDNA clones derived from human and pig feces. The nearest named relatives of the unidentified isolate corresponded to Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (formerly Fusobacterium prausnitzii) displaying a 16S rRNA sequence divergence of approximately 9%, with Anaerofilum agile and A. pentosovorans the next closest relatives of the unidentified bacterium (sequence divergence approximately 10%). Based on phenotypic and phylogenetic considerations, it is proposed that the unusual coccoid-shaped organism be classified as a new genus and species, Subdoligranulum variabile. The type strain of S. variabile is BI 114(T) (=CCUG 47106(T)=DSM 15176(T)).
