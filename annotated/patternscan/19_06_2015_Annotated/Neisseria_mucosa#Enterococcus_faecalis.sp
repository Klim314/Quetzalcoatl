TI  == isolation and identification of symbiotic bacteria from the skin, mouth, and rectum of wild and captive tree shrews.
AB  == endosymbionts influence many aspects of their hosts' health conditions, including physiology, development, immunity, metabolism, etc. tree shrews (tupaia belangeri chinensis) have attracted increasing attention in modeling human diseases and therapeutic responses due to their close relationship with primates. to clarify the situation of symbiotic bacteria from their body surface, oral cavity, and anus, 12 wild and 12 the third generation of captive tree shrews were examined. based on morphological and cultural characteristics, physiological and biochemical tests, as well as the 16s rdna full sequence analysis, 12 bacteria strains were isolated and identified from the wild tree shrews: body surface: bacillus subtilis (detection rate 42%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (25%), staphlococcus aureus (33%), s. epidermidis (75%), micrococcus luteus (25%), kurthia gibsonii (17%); oral cavity: neisseria mucosa (58%), streptococcus pneumonia (17%); anus: enterococcus faecalis (17%), lactococus lactis (33%), escherichia coli (92%), salmonella typhosa (17%); whereas, four were indentified  from the third generation captive tree shrews: body surface: s. epidermidis (75%); oral cavity: n.mucosa (67%); anus: l. lactis (33%), e. coli (100%). these  results indicate that s. epidermidis, n. mucosa, l. lactis and e. coli were major bacteria in tree shrews, whereas, s. aureus, m. luteus, k. gibsonii, e. faecalis  and s. typhosa were species-specific flora. this study facilitates the future use of tree shrews as a standard experimental animal and improves our understanding of the relationship between endosymbionts and their hosts.

TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == bacterial colonization of microbial biofilms in oral squamous cell carcinoma.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of this prospective clinical study was to identify the bacterial spectra on the surface of oral squamous cell carcinomas (oscc) in comparison to oral mucosa of patients with a higher risk to emerge an oscc and a  control group to determine their susceptibility to various common antibiotics. material and methods: swabs from 90 patients, 30 patients of each group, were cultured on media for aerobes and anaerobes and tested with agar diffusion and etest. results: the predominant pathogens of the normal healthy oral mucosa were  aerobes. the ratio between aerobes and anaerobes was 2:1, balanced in risk patients and inverted in the oscc group. altogether, 1,006 isolates were cultured. the most frequent strains were 47 viridans streptococci, 30 staphylococcus species, 14 enterococcus faecalis, 36 neisseria species, 14 escherichia coli, and 23 other aerobes, 66 peptostreptococcus species, 39 fusobacterium species, and 34 prevotella species. the resistance rates in the oscc group were penicillin 40%, ampicillin 57%, doxycycline 23%, clindamycin 47%, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 20%, but up to 100% of pathogens were susceptible to azithromycin, telithromycin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. conclusion: gram-negative anaerobes play a decisive role in the development of postoperative  infections in patients with oscc. this tumor special type of colonization does not agree with the normal flora of the oral cavity. clinical relevance: biofilms  on oscc surfaces provide an important reservoir for anaerobic bacteria. as a consequence, a proposal for an antibiotic prophylactic regime should be given.

TI  == enterococcus faecalis inhibits superantigen toxic shock syndrome toxin-1-induced  interleukin-8 from human vaginal epithelial cells through tetramic acids.
AB  == the vaginal mucosa can be colonized by many bacteria including commensal organisms and potential pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus. some strains of s. aureus produce the superantigen toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, which can penetrate the vaginal epithelium to cause toxic shock syndrome. we have observed  that a female was mono-colonized with enterococcus faecalis vaginally as tested in aerobic culture, even upon repeated culture for six months, suggesting this organism was negatively influencing colonization by other bacteria. in recent studies, we demonstrated an "outside-in" mechanism of cytokine signaling and consequent inflammation that facilitates the ability of potential pathogens to initiate infection from mucosal surfaces. thus, we hypothesized that this strain  of e. faecalis may make anti-inflammatory factors which block disease progression of more pathogenic organisms. e. faecalis mn1 inhibited interleukin-8 production  from human vaginal epithelial cells in response to the vaginal pathogens candida  albicans, gardnerella vaginalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, as well as to toxic shock syndrome toxin-1. we further demonstrated that this organism secretes two tetramic acid compounds which appear responsible for inhibition of interleukin-8  production, as well as inhibition of t cell proliferation due to toxic shock syndrome toxin-1. microbicides that include anti-inflammatory molecules, such as  these tetramic acid compounds naturally produced by e. faecalis mn1, may be useful in prevention of diseases that develop from vaginal infections.

TI  == a microbiological profile of symptomatic teeth with primary endodontic infections.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections associated with symptomatic teeth. samples were collected by means of a #15 h-type file and 2 sterile paper points from 60 symptomatic (n = 30) or asymptomatic (n = 30) single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. the presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. the species found in higher counts (x10(5)) in symptomatic cases were fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii, veillonella parvula, treponema socranskii, enterococcus faecalis, and campylobacter gracilis  and in asymptomatic cases were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, e. faecalis, eubacterium saburreum, and neisseria mucosa. total bacterial counts and counts of tannerella forsythia were significant higher in symptomatic cases (p < 0.05), whereas levels of propionibacterium acnes were reduced in this group of teeth. the data of the present investigation suggested an association between higher total bacterial counts and levels of t. forsythia and the presence of pain.

TI  == microbiological evaluation of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without sinus tract.
AB  == aim: to examine the microbiological status of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without a sinus tract. methodology: samples were collected by means of a size 15 h-type file and two sterile paper points from 30 cases of primary endodontic infections with (n = 15) or without (n = 15) a sinus tract. the presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: the species found at the highest levels and prevalence were fusobacterium nucleatum sp. vincentii, porphyromonas gingivalis,  veillonella parvula, enterococcus faecalis, campylobacter gracilis and neisseria  mucosa. total bacterial counts were similar between teeth with (44 x 10(5)) and without (50 x 10(5)) a sinus tract (t-test: p > 0.05). e. faecalis, streptococcus anginosus, capnocytophaga sputigena and capnocytophaga gingivalis had significantly higher counts in the absence of sinus tract (mann-whitney test, p < 0.05). higher levels of p. gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum were observed in cases with a sinus tract. leptotrichia buccalis (or = 1.83; ci 95%) and porphyromonas endodontalis (or = 2.15; ci 95%) were associated with an increased chance of subjects having a sinus tract. conclusions: primary endodontic infections were associated with a large variety of bacterial species.  specific differences between the composition of the microbiota of primary root canal infections were observed in cases with or without a sinus tract.

TI  == evaluation of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections using checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in 111 selected cases of single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. methods: samples were collected from the  root canals using #15 hedstroen-type files and two sterile paper points, which were introduced 1 mm short of the apical foramen. the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 different bacterial species in each sample were determined using dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization techniques. results: the  mean number of species per sample was 22. enterococcus faecalis (89.3%), campylobacter gracilis (89.3%), leptotrichia buccalis (89.3%), neisseria mucosa (87.5%), prevotella melaninogenica (86.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii (85.7%), eubacterium saburreum (75.9%), streptococcus anginosus (75%),  and veillonella parvula (74.1%) were the most prevalent species. the species found in highest mean counts (over 10(5)) were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii (13.14 x 10(5)), e. saburreum (5.67 x 10(5)), e. faecalis (5.38 x 10(5)), n. mucosa (4.19 x 10(5)), v. parvula (3.63 x 10(5)), c. gracilis (3.46 x 10(5)), treponema  socranskii (3.34 x 10(5)), porphyromonas endodontalis (2.96 x 10(5)), porphyromonas gingivalis (2.85 x 10(5)), micromonas micros (2.81 x 10(5)), prevotella nigrescens (2.68 x 10(5)) and fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (2.64 x 10(5)). most of these species were also found in high proportions. conclusions: our results suggest that several bacterial species considered to be  oral pathogens seem to be implicated in the etiology of primary endodontic infections.

TI  == identification of the conjugative mef gene in clinical acinetobacter junii and neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates.
AB  == the mef gene, originally described for gram-positive organisms and coding for an  efflux pump, has been identified in clinical isolates of acinetobacter junii and  neisseria gonorrhoeae. these strains could transfer the mef gene at frequencies ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-9) into one or more of the following recipients: gram-negative moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria perflava/sicca and neisseria mucosa and gram-positive enterococcus faecalis. three streptococcus pneumoniae strains could transfer the mef gene into eikenella corrodens, haemophilus influenzae, kingella denitrificans, m. catarrhalis, neisseria meningitidis, n. perflava/sicca, and n. mucosa at similar frequencies. the mef gene can thus be transferred to and expressed in a variety of gram-negative recipients.
