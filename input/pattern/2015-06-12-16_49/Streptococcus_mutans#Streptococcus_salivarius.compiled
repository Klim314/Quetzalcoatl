TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy of Acacia nilotica, Murraya koenigii L. Sprengel, Eucalyptus hybrid, and Psidium guajava on primary plaque colonizers: An in vitro comparison between hot and cold extraction process.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The potential drawbacks of the existing antiplaque agents call for innovative strategies that are safe, effective, and easily available. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess and compare antimicrobial efficacy of four plant extracts derived using hot and cold extraction methods against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus salivarius. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The leaves of Acacia nilotica, P. guajava, Eucalyptus hybrid, and Murraya konigii L. Sprengel were collected from the surrounding areas, identified and authenticated by a taxonomist. The leaves were washed, shade-dried, and hand crushed to obtain coarse powder. This was subsequently ground into a fine powder and extracted using ethanol by cold infusion and hot extraction process. The antimicrobial efficacy testing was done on American Type Culture Collection strains of S. mutans, S. sanguis, and S. salivarius using agar well diffusion method. 0.2% chlorhexidine and dimethyl sulfoxide were used as positive and negative controls. The mean inhibition zone using 10% concentration of these extracts was compared using independent sample t-test and one-way analysis of variance. RESULTS: All the four plant extracts inhibited the growth of S. mutans, S. sanguis, and S. salivarius irrespective of the method of extraction. The extracts of A. nilotica, P. guajava, and E. hybrid derived from both the methods of extraction exhibited a significantly higher inhibition zone against S. mutans in comparison with Murraya koenigii L. Sprengel and chlorhexidine. The cold extracts of A. nilotica and E. hybrid exhibited higher zone of inhibition against S. sanguis while the hot extracts of M. koenigii L. Sprengel exhibited a higher zone of inhibition against S. mutans. CONCLUSION: All the four plant extracts derived using either hot or cold extraction were effective against these bacteria and have the potential to be used as antiplaque agents.
TI  - Oral lactic acid bacteria related to the occurrence and/or progression of dental  caries in Japanese preschool children.
AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that the presence of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), especially those classified into the genus Lactobacillus, is associated with the progression of dental caries in preschool children. Nevertheless, the kinds of species of LAB and the characteristics that are important for dental caries have been unclear. The aims of this study were: (1) to investigate the distribution of oral LAB among Japanese preschool children with various prevalence levels of caries; and (2) to reveal the characteristics of these isolated LAB species. Seventy-four Japanese preschool children were examined for caries scores and caries progression, and their dental cavity samples were collected for LAB isolation and identification. The saliva-induced agglutination rate and the resistance to acidic environments of the identified strains were measured. Statistical analysis showed that preschool children carrying Lactobacillus (L.) salivarius or Streptococcus mutans have a significantly higher prevalence of dental caries, the growth ability in acidic environments correlates with the caries scores of individuals with L. salivarius, and the caries scores exhibit positive correlation with saliva-induced agglutination in L. salivarius. These results show that specific Lactobacillus species are associated with dental caries based on the level of carious lesion severity. The present study suggests that these specific Lactobacillus species, especially those with easily agglutinated properties and acid resistance, affect the dental caries scores of preschool children, and that these properties may provide useful information for research into the prevention of dental caries.
TI  - Effect of Probiotic Containing Ice-cream on Salivary Mutans Streptococci (SMS) Levels in Children of 6-12 Years of Age: A Randomized Controlled Double Blind Study with Six-months Follow Up.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the caries risk based on the salivary levels of streptococcus mutans in children of 6-12 years of age group before and after consuming probiotic ice-cream containing Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A double blind, placebo controlled trial was carried out in 60 children aged between 6 to 12 years with zero decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT). They were randomly divided into two equal groups. Saliva sample were collected before the consumption of ice-cream and Streptococcus mutans count was calculated and recorded as baseline data. For the next seven days both the groups were given ice creams marked as A and B. Saliva samples were collected after ice-cream consumption at the end of study period and also after a washout period of 30 days and again after six months. Samples were inoculated and colonies were counted. RESULTS: On statistical evaluation by students paired t-test, probiotic ice-cream brought significant reduction in the Streptococcus mutans count after seven days of ice-cream ingestion (p<0.001) and also after 30 d of washout period (p<0.001). There was no significant reduction (p=0.076) by normal ice-cream consumption. After six months of the study period in both the groups the salivary levels of Streptococcus mutans was similar to the baseline. CONCLUSION: Probiotic ice-cream containing Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 can cause reduction in caries causative organism. The dosage of the probiotic organisms for the long term or synergetic effect on the oral health are still needed to be explored.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of clove, gall nut methanolic and ethanolic extracts on Streptococcus mutans PTCC 1683 and Streptococcus salivarius PTCC 1448.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Antimicrobial compounds from herbal sources have good therapeutic potential. In this study, the antibacterial effects of clove and gall nut, methanolic and ethanolic extractions, were evaluated for their effect on Streptococcus mutans PTCC 1683 and Streptococcus salivarius PTCC 1448, as both the two cause oral diseases. METHOD: The clove and gall nut methanolic and ethanolic extracts were prepared and antibacterial activity was evaluated for S. mutans and S. salivarius in the base of inhibition zone diameter using agar diffusion method. In this part minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) were assessed. RESULTS: These extracts showed effective antibacterial activity on bacteria. Antibacterial activity of Methanolic extract of clove was more than that of ethanolic extract, and ethanolic extracts of gall nut had antibacterial activity more than that of methanolic extracts. MIC and MBC results for clove methanolic extract were 1.5 mg/ml and 3 mg/ml for S. mutans and 6.25 mg/ml and 12.5 mg/ml for S. salivarius, respectively. These results for clove ethanolic extracts were 12.5 mg/ml and 25 mg/ml for S. mutans and 25 mg/ml and 50 mg/ml for S. salivarius, respectively. MIC and MBC results for gall nut methanolic extract were 25 mg/ml and 50 mg/ml for S. mutans and 12.5 mg/ml and 25 mg/ml for S. salivarius, respectively. These results for gall nut ethanolic extracts were 3.1 mg/ml and 6.2 mg/ml for S. mutans and 25 mg/ml and 50 mg/ml for S. salivarius, respectively. DISCUSSION: The results showed effective antibacterial activity using clove and gall nut methanolic extracts. If other properties such as tolerance of tissue can also be studied, these extracts can be used as a mouthwash.
TI  - Biological and chemical-physical properties of root-end filling materials: A comparative study.
AB  - AIM: The purpose of the study is to evaluate and compare the biological and chemical-physical properties of four different root-end filling materials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cytotoxicity towards murine odontoblasts cells (MDPC-23) was evaluated using the Transwell insert methodology by Alamar blue test. Streptococcus salivarius, S. sanguis, and S. mutans strains were selected to evaluate the antimicrobial activity by agar disc diffusion test. Solubility was determined after 24 h and 2 months. pH values were measured after 3 and 24 h. To evaluate radiopacity, all materials were scanned on a GE Healthcare Lunar Prodigy. RESULTS: Excellent percentage of vitality were obtained by mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA)-based materials and Biodentine. MTA-Angelus, ProRoot MTA, and Intermediate Restorative Material (IRM) showed the highest values for the inhibition zones when tested for S. mutans, while Biodentine showed the largest inhibition zone when tested for S. sanguis. All the materials fulfilled the requirements of the International Standard 6876, demonstrating low solubility with a weight loss of less than 3%. No significant reduction in pH value was demonstrated after 24 h. ProRoot MTA and MTA-Angelus showed the highest values of radiographic density. CONCLUSIONS: The differences showed by the root-end filling materials tested do not cover completely the ideal clinical requests.
TI  - Comparison of the Antibacterial Properties of Three Mouthwashes Containing Chlorhexidine Against Oral Microbial Plaques: An in vitro Study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mouth provides an environment that allows the colonization and growth of a wide variety of microorganisms, especially bacteria. One of the most effective ways to reduce oral microorganisms is using mouthwashes. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial effects of chlorhexidine mouthwashes (manufacture by Livar, Behsa, Boht) on common oral microorganisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this in vitro study, isolated colonies of four bacteria, including Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguinis, S. salivarius and Lactobacillus casei, were prepared for an antimicrobial mouth rinse test. The tube dilution method was used for determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC). RESULTS: The MICs for Kin gingival, Behsa and Boht mouthwashes were 0.14, 0.48 and 1000 micrograms/mL using the tube method for S. mutans, respectively. The MBCs for the mentioned mouthwashes were 0.23, 1.9 and 2000 micrograms/mL for S. mutans, respectively. The MICs for Kin gingival, Behsa and Boht mouthwashes were 0.073, 0.48 and 250 micrograms/mL using the tube method for S. sanguinis, respectively. The MBCs for the mentioned mouthwashes were 0.14, 1.9 and 1000 micrograms/mL for S. sanguinis, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The Kin Gingival chlorhexidine mouthwash has a greater effect than Behsa and Boht mouthwashes on oral microorganisms and is recommended to be used for plaque chemical inhibition.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of apitoxin, melittin and phospholipase A(2) of honey bee  (Apis mellifera) venom against oral pathogens.
AB  - In this work, we used the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) technique to evaluate the antibacterial potential of the apitoxin produced by Apis mellifera bees against the causative agents of tooth decay. Apitoxin was assayed in natura and in the commercially available form. The antibacterial actions of the main components of this apitoxin, phospholipase A2, and melittin were also assessed, alone and in combination. The following bacteria were tested: Streptococcus salivarius, S. sobrinus, S. mutans, S. mitis, S. sanguinis, Lactobacillus casei, and Enterococcus faecalis. The MIC results obtained for the commercially available apitoxin and for the apitoxin in natura were close and lay between 20 and 40 microg / mL, which indicated good antibacterial activity. Melittin was the most active component in apitoxin; it displayed very promising MIC values, from 4 to 40 microg / mL. Phospholipase A2 presented MIC values higher than 400 microg / mL. Association of mellitin with phospholipase A2 yielded MIC values ranging between 6 and 80 microg / mL. Considering that tooth decay affects people's health, apitoxin and its component melittin have potential application against oral pathogens.
TI  - Effect of Rhus coriaria L. water extract on five common oral bacteria and bacterial biofilm formation on orthodontic wire.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Recently, use of herbal medicine and plant extracts as a substitute for commercially available chemical drugs for control of infectious diseases such as dental caries and periodontal disease has become increasingly popular. The present study was aimed to evaluate the effect of Rhus coriaria L. water extract on five common oral bacteria and bacterial biofilm formation on orthodontic wire. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For primary assessment of the antibacterial properties of Rhus coriaria L. water extract, the well-plate method in BHIA (Brain Heart Infusion Agar, Merck, Germany) medium was used Using macrodilution method, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the extract against each microorganism were determined. The effect of Rhus coriaria L. on bacterial biofilm formation on orthodontic wire was assessed using viable cell count in biofilm medium (BM) containing 3% sucrose. In the final phase, after fixation of samples in alcohol and glutaraldehyde, samples were prepared for SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) analysis. RESULTS: The diameter of the zone of growth inhibition was proportionate to the tested concentrations of the extract. The lowest MIC (0.390 mg/ml) and MBC (1.5 mg/ml ) of the Rhus coriaria L. were found to be against Streptococcus sobrinus ATCC 27607. Rhus coriaria L. water extract decreased bacterial biofilm formation on orthodontic wire at MIC and 1/8 of MIC by S. sanguinis ATCC 10556, S. sobrinus ATCC 27607, S. salivarius ATCC 9222, S. mutans ATCC 35608 and E. faecalis CIP 55142 by24.2%-43%, 68.5%-91.6%, 10.6%-79.1%, 22.2%-86.1% and 40.6%-76.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Based on the results, Rhus coriaria L. water extract had significant antibacterial properties against five common oral bacteria and was able to inhibit bacterial biofilm formation on orthodontic wire. Further investigations are recommended for widespread clinical use of this extract.
TI  - Recolonization of mutans Streptococci after application of chlorhexidine gel.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans is specifically suppressed by intensive treatment with chlorhexidine gel, but the time for recolonization and the effect on other oral bacteria are not totally clear. In this study, recolonization of mutans streptococci was evaluated in nine healthy adult volunteers, who were highly colonized with this microorganism. Stimulated saliva was collected before (baseline) and at 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after application of 1% chlorhexidine gel on volunteers' teeth for two consecutive days. On each day, the gel was applied using disposable trays for 3 x 5 min with intervals of 5 min between each application. Saliva was plated on blood agar to determine total microorganisms (TM); on mitis salivarius agar to determine total streptococci (TS) and on mitis salivarius agar plus bacitracin to determine mutans streptococci (MS). Chlorhexidine was capable of reducing the counts of MS and the proportion of MS with regard to total microorganisms (%MS/TM) (p<0.05), but these values did not differ statistically from baseline (p>0.05) after 14 days for MS and 21 days for %MS/TM. The counts of TM and TS and the proportion of MS to total streptococci did not differ statistically from baseline (p>0.05) after chlorhexidine treatment. The results suggest that the effect of chlorhexidine gel treatment on suppression of mutans streptococci is limited to less than a month in highly colonized individuals.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy of the combinations of Acacia nilotica, Murraya koenigii L. sprengel, Eucalyptus hybrid and Psidium guajava on primary plaque colonizers.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need for innovative strategies to combat the two most common dental diseases of mankind namely dental caries and periodontitis. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to assess the antimicrobial efficacy of the double combinations of Acacia nilotica (AN), Murraya koenigii L. Sprengel (MKL), Eucalyptus hybrid and Psidium guajava on primary plaque colonizers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The plant extracts of AN, MKL. Sprengel, Eucalyptus hybrid and P. guajava were prepared using Soxhlet apparatus. The stock solutions of individual plant extracts (100 mg/ml) were prepared. Equal quantities of stock solutions were mixed to obtain six double combinations of herbal extracts. The antimicrobial efficacy testing was done against three primary plaque colonizers using agar well-diffusion method. 0.2% chlorhexidine and dimethyl sulfoxide were used as positive and as negative controls. The mean inhibition zone between the categories was compared using one-way Analysis of Variance and Tukey's post hoc test. RESULTS: The combination of AN and P. guajava produced the highest mean diameter of inhibition zone (21.08 mm +/- 2.11) against Streptococcus mutans. The chlorhexidine produced the least inhibition zone against S. mutans (14.50 +/- 2.07). The combination of AN and P. guajava produced the maximum antimicrobial efficacy against Streptococcus sanguis (19.67 +/- 1.03) and Streptococcus salivarius (20.33 +/- 1.86). CONCLUSION: All the combinations of plant extracts have the potential to be used as antiplaque and anticaries agents. The combinations of herbal extracts offer enhanced antimicrobial efficacy due to the synergistic effects besides slowing the development of resistance.
TI  - Cariogenic bacteria and dental health status in adolescents: the role of oral health behaviours.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the association between dental health status and levels of cariogenic bacteria in teenagers and the influence of behaviours and socio-demographic background on levels of bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study design: A cross-sectional population-based sample of 13-year-old adolescents (112 females and 78 males, total 190) was examined. The number of decayed, missing and filled surfaces (DMFS), plaque and hygiene index were recorded according to the WHO criteria. The saliva samples were collected in a sterile container and then analysed by culture on Mitis Salivarius Bacitracin (MSB) agar for mutans Streptococci and on Man Rogosa Sharp (MRS) agar for Lactobacilli. The levels of bacteria were expressed as the number of colonies forming units per millilitre of saliva (CFU/ml). Associations between levels of mutans Streptococci and Lactobacilli and dental health were estimated by odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) using unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS: No mutans Streptococci were detected in 53.2% of the adolescents but 22.6% presented >/= 10(3) CFU/ml. For Lactobacilli, these values were, respectively 43.7% and 34.7%. After adjustment for gender and social class, the OR (95% CI) for DMFS >5 was 8.66 (3.57-21.02) if mutans Streptococci >/= 10(3) CFU and 2.11 (0.96-4.64) if Lactobacilli >/= 10(3) CFU. CONCLUSION: This data allow us to conclude that hygiene habits and dental visits are not associated with high levels of cariogenic bacteria, but high scores of DMFS were found in adolescents with high levels of mutans Streptococci and lower parents' education.
TI  - The influence of antibacterial toothpastes on in vitro Streptococcus mutans biofilm formation: a continuous culture study.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the in vitro effect of five toothpastes containing antimicrobial compounds including fluoride, triclosan or hydroxyapatite nano-particles on Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) biofilm formation. Fluoride uptake by enamel after bacterial challenge was also evaluated. METHODS: Human enamel disks (n= 192) were randomly divided into six groups and brushed with five different toothpastes while the control group was brushed with distilled water. Each group was incubated for 24 and 72 hours with a S. mutans biofilm growing on a modified drip-flow reactor (MDFR). Biofilm formation was determined using a viable biomass assay based on a tetrazolium salt (MTT) and evaluated morphologically with confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM) and scanning electron-microscopy (SEM). Fluoride uptake was evaluated using the enamel biopsy technique. Biofilm formation was also evaluated using 120 disks randomly divided into the same six groups. The number of viable bacteria was determined through plate count on Mitis Salivarius Bacitracin agar (MSB agar). RESULTS: Data from plate count showed the same overall trend of MTT assay. The latter showed that after 24 hours the effect of the tested toothpastes was significantly higher in reducing biofilm formation than after 72 hours. The toothpaste containing a high concentration of amine fluoride (AmF) had the highest performance in reducing biofilm formation. Fluoride uptake of enamel showed a positive trend related to the fluoride concentration in both incubation times.
TI  - Effect of Chocobar Ice Cream Containing Bifidobacterium on Salivary Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacilli: A Randomised Controlled Trial.
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the effect of chocobar ice cream containing bifidobacteria on salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A double-blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted with 30 subjects (18 to 22 years of age) divided into 2 groups, test (chocobar ice cream with probiotics) and control (chocobar ice cream without probiotics). The subjects were instructed to eat the allotted chocobar ice cream once daily for 18 days. Saliva samples collected at intervals were cultured on Mitis Salivarius agar and Rogosa agar and examined for salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli, respectively. The Mann-Whitney U-test, Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Postingestion in the test group, a statistically significant reduction (p < 0.05) of salivary mutans streptococci was recorded, but a non-significant trend was seen for lactobacilli. Significant differences were was also observed between follow-ups. CONCLUSION: Short-term daily ingestion of ice cream containing probiotic bifidobacteria may reduce salivary levels of mutans streptococci in young adults.
TI  - Effects of Lactobacillus salivarius-containing tablets on caries risk factors: a  randomized open-label clinical trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the effects of the lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus salivarius on caries risk factors. METHODS: The study was performed in 64 healthy volunteers to evaluate the effects of L. salivarius-containing tablets on caries risk factors. The participants were divided randomly into four groups, and took tablets containing L. salivarius WB21, L. salivarius TI 2711, Ovalgen(R) DC (antibody against glucosyltransferase from Streptococcus mutans), or xylitol. Levels of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli, amount of salivary flow, salivary pH, and salivary buffering capacity were assessed before and after taking the tablets. Subsequently, a short-term administration trial using L. salivarius WB21-containing tablets was performed in eight healthy volunteers. The participants took L. salivarius WB21-containing tablets (2.0 x 10(9) colony forming units/day) for 2 weeks, and the numbers of mutans streptococci in saliva were counted. RESULTS: The levels of mutans streptococci seemed to decrease in the L. salivarius WB21, TI 2711, and Ovalgen(R) DC groups compared to the xylitol group, with no significant differences between the groups. Lactobacilli levels significantly increased in the L. salivarius WB21 and TI 2711 groups compared to the other groups. Concerning salivary flow and salivary pH, no significant differences were observed between the groups. The salivary buffering capacity significantly increased in the L. salivarius TI 2711 group (P = 0.003) and Ovalgen(R) DC group (P = 0.002) compared to the xylitol group. The short-term administration trial showed that the L. salivarius WB21-containing tablets significantly decreased the number of mutans streptococci (P = 0.039). CONCLUSION: L. salivarius-containing tablets were suggested to increase resistance to caries risk factors. TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN000013160 (registration date: February 14, 2014).
TI  - Molecular identification and antibiotic resistant bacteria isolated from primary  dentition infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a health problem in many parts of the world. The aim of this study was to identify bacteria from dental infections and determine bacterial resistance to antibiotics used in dental care in the primary dentition. METHODS: This cross-sectional study comprised 60 children who presented for dental treatment for active dental infections in the primary dentition. Samples from dental infections were collected and bacteria were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics was determined by colony forming units on agar plates containing amoxicillin, clindamycin and amoxillicin-clavulanic acid (A-CA) tested at 8 mug/ml or 16 mug/ml. RESULTS: Clindamycin in both concentrations tested (8 mug/ml and 16 mug/ml) showed the highest bacterial resistance (85.9%), followed by amoxicillin (43.7%) and A-CA (12.0%). All comparisons among the three antibiotics used in the study exhibited statistical significance (p = <0.05) in both concentrations tested (8 mug/ml and 16 mug/ml), and under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The most prevalent resistant species identified by PCR in primary dentition infections were: Streptococcus oralis and Prevotella intermedia (75.0%); Treponema denticola and Porphyromonas gingivalis (48.3%); Streptococcus mutans (45.0%); Campylobacter rectus; and Streptococcus salivarius (40%). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that A-CA exhibited the lowest bacterial resistance for clinical isolates in primary dentition infections.
TI  - Comparative genomics of the bacterial genus Streptococcus illuminates evolutionary implications of species groups.
AB  - Members of the genus Streptococcus within the phylum Firmicutes are among the most diverse and significant zoonotic pathogens. This genus has gone through considerable taxonomic revision due to increasing improvements of chemotaxonomic approaches, DNA hybridization and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. It is proposed to place the majority of streptococci into "species groups". However, the evolutionary implications of species groups are not clear presently. We use comparative genomic approaches to yield a better understanding of the evolution of Streptococcus through genome dynamics, population structure, phylogenies and virulence factor distribution of species groups. Genome dynamics analyses indicate that the pan-genome size increases with the addition of newly sequenced strains, while the core genome size decreases with sequential addition at the genus level and species group level. Population structure analysis reveals two distinct lineages, one including Pyogenic, Bovis, Mutans and Salivarius groups, and the other including Mitis, Anginosus and Unknown groups. Phylogenetic dendrograms show that species within the same species group cluster together, and infer two main clades in accordance with population structure analysis. Distribution of streptococcal virulence factors has no obvious patterns among the species groups; however, the evolution of some common virulence factors is congruous with the evolution of species groups, according to phylogenetic inference. We suggest that the proposed streptococcal species groups are reasonable from the viewpoints of comparative genomics; evolution of the genus is congruent with the individual evolutionary trajectories of different species groups.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Lactobacillus salivarius on Streptococcus mutans biofilm formation.
AB  - Dental caries arises from an imbalance of metabolic activities in dental biofilms developed primarily by Streptococcus mutans. This study was conducted to isolate potential oral probiotics with antagonistic activities against S. mutans biofilm formation from Lactobacillus salivarius, frequently found in human saliva. We analysed 64 L. salivarius strains and found that two, K35 and K43, significantly inhibited S. mutans biofilm formation with inhibitory activities more pronounced than those of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), a prototypical probiotic that shows anti-caries activity. Scanning electron microscopy showed that co-culture of S. mutans with K35 or K43 resulted in significantly reduced amounts of attached bacteria and network-like structures, typically comprising exopolysaccharides. Spot assay for S. mutans indicated that K35 and K43 strains possessed a stronger bactericidal activity against S. mutans than LGG. Moreover, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that the expression of genes encoding glucosyltransferases, gtfB, gtfC, and gtfD was reduced when S. mutans were co-cultured with K35 or K43. However, LGG activated the expression of gtfB and gtfC, but did not influence the expression of gtfD in the co-culture. A transwell-based biofilm assay indicated that these lactobacilli inhibited S. mutans biofilm formation in a contact-independent manner. In conclusion, we identified two L. salivarius strains with inhibitory activities on the growth and expression of S. mutans virulence genes to reduce its biofilm formation. This is not a general characteristic of the species, so presents a potential strategy for in vivo alteration of plaque biofilm and caries.
TI  - Cytocompatibility and antibacterial properties of capping materials.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antimicrobial activity and  cytocompatibility of six different pulp-capping materials: Dycal (Dentsply), Calcicur (Voco), Calcimol LC (Voco), TheraCal LC (Bisco), MTA Angelus (Angelus), and Biodentine (Septodont). To evaluate antimicrobial activity, materials were challenged in vitro with Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, and Streptococcus sanguis in the agar disc diffusion test. Cytocompatibility of the assayed materials towards rat MDPC-23 cells was evaluated at different times by both MTT and apoptosis assays. Results significantly differed among the different materials tested. Both bacterial growth inhibition halos and cytocompatibility performances were significantly different among materials with different composition. MTA-based products showed lower cytotoxicity and valuable antibacterial activity, different from calcium hydroxide-based materials, which exhibited not only higher antibacterial activity but also higher cytotoxicity.
TI  - Propolis varnish: antimicrobial properties against cariogenic bacteria, cytotoxicity, and sustained-release profile.
AB  - Varnishes are preparations that differ in the polymeric matrix and therapeutical  agents. In dentistry they are used to prevent caries. In this study we developed a propolis varnish, considering propolis properties against cariogenic bacteria. To a chitosan polymeric base (CHV) was added ethanolic propolis extract in different concentrations: PV1 (5%), PV2 (10%), and PV3 (15%). Antimicrobial activity was carried out against Streptococcus mutans (SM), Streptococcus sanguinis (SG), Streptococcus salivarius (SS), and Lactobacillus casei (LC) through agar diffusion method. The three propolis concentrations incorporated were effective in inhibiting the growth of all microorganisms, but without significant difference between the zones of inhibition observed. Cytotoxicity assay was done by MTT method. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni test. None of the varnishes were cytotoxic, keeping 80% of viable cells, while CHV allowed cellular proliferation (120%). Sustained-release test was carried out by applying 40 mu L of each varnish in the buccal surface of bovine teeth and kept in an ethanol/water solution removed in regular times. According to the "independent model approach," the release profiles were distinct from each varnish and the most prolonged was PV3 (8 weeks). Varnish formulations had satisfactory antimicrobial activity against cariogenic bacteria and have a low cytotoxicity (<50%).
TI  - Evaluation of the antimicrobial effect of conventional and nanosilver-containing  varnishes on oral streptococci.
AB  - STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM: Nanosilver particles have the potential to serve as a bactericidal agent because of the inherent antimicrobial influences of silver ion. The literature confirmed that specific micro-organisms, especially streptococci, have an important role as an etiological factor for caries. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of conventional and nanosilver-containing varnishes on oral streptococci. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Pure cultivations of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus salivarius were prepared on blood agar media. Thereafter, 0.5 McFarland standard of recently grown bacteria in normal saline was prepared and the bacteria were cultivated monotonously on the culture medium surface by applying a swab. Different concentrations of nanosilver varnishes were prepared in the Mueller- Hinton broth medium in the test tubes and equal amounts of 0.5 McFarland suspension of all the tested bacteria were added separately to all test tubes. A tube without varnish was included as the control sample. The tubes were kept at 37 degrees C for 24 hours, then cultured to determine the numbers of bacteria in each tube by counting colonies. The numbers of bacteria in tubes with varnish were compared to the numbers of bacteria in the tube without varnish. In the instance of observing any reduction in the growth, the minimum inhibitory concentration for growth in the tube with varnish was determined. RESULTS: Nanosilver varnish had an antimicrobial effect on S. mutans and S. salivarius. S. salivarius was more susceptible than S. mutans to the nanosilver varnish. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this study, nanosilver varnishes can be used under amalgam restorations to reduce microbial population and subsequently preventing the recurrent caries.
TI  - The influence of oral Veillonella species on biofilms formed by Streptococcus species.
AB  - Oral Veillonella, Veillonella atypica, Veillonella denticariosi, Veillonella dispar, Veillonella parvula, Veillonella rogosae, and Veillonella tobetsuensis are known as early colonizers in oral biofilm formation. To investigate the role of oral Veillonella, biofilms formed by the co-culture of Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, or Streptococcus sanguinis, with oral Veillonella were examined at the species level. The amount of biofilm formed by S. mutans, S. gordonii, and S. salivarius in the presence of the six Veillonella species was greater than that formed in the control experiments, with the exception of S. mutans with V. dispar. In contrast, in the case of biofilm formation by S. sanguinis, the presence of Veillonella species reduced the amount of the biofilm, with the exception of V. parvula and V. dispar. The time-dependent changes in the amount of biofilm and the number of planktonic cells were grouped into four patterns over the 24 combinations. Only that of S. gordonii with V. tobetsuensis showed a unique pattern. These results indicate that the mode of action of this combination differed from that of the other combinations with respect to biofilm formation. It is possible that there may be several factors involved in the interaction between Streptococcus and Veillonella species.
TI  - Control of natural transformation in salivarius Streptococci through specific degradation of sigmaX by the MecA-ClpCP protease complex.
AB  - Competence for natural DNA transformation is a tightly controlled developmental process in streptococci. In mutans and salivarius species, the abundance of the central competence regulator sigma(X) is regulated at two levels: transcriptional, by the ComRS signaling system via the sigma(X)/ComX/SigX-inducing peptide (XIP), and posttranscriptional, by the adaptor protein MecA and its associated Clp ATPase, ClpC. In this study, we further investigated the mechanism and function of the MecA-ClpC control system in the salivarius species Streptococcus thermophilus. Using in vitro approaches, we showed that MecA specifically interacts with both sigma(X) and ClpC, suggesting the formation of a ternary sigma(X)-MecA-ClpC complex. Moreover, we demonstrated that MecA ultimately targets sigma(X) for its degradation by the ClpCP protease in an ATP-dependent manner. We also identify a short sequence (18 amino acids) in the N-terminal domain of sigma(X) as essential for the interaction with MecA and subsequent sigma(X) degradation. Finally, increased transformability of a MecA-deficient strain in the presence of subinducing XIP concentrations suggests that the MecA-ClpCP proteolytic complex acts as an additional locking device to prevent competence under inappropriate conditions. A model of the interplay between ComRS and MecA-ClpCP in the control of sigma(X) activity is proposed.
TI  - Molecular detection of bacteria associated to dental caries in 4-12-year-old Tunisian children.
AB  - The occurrence of several microbial species in the oral cavity of 4-12-year-old Tunisian children was investigated. Samples were taken from 158 children (81 caries actives and 77 caries free). Genomic DNA was extracted and analyzed for the presence of 17 microbial species using a polymerase chain reaction assay. All samples were positive for at least one of the target microbial strains. Streptococcus mutans was the most prevalent species (76.5%) detected in genomic DNA collected from carious lesions. Other prevalent species were Candida spp (63%), Streptococcus salivarius (59%) and Streptococcus oralis (42%). The frequency of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus casei-group in caries lesions was 29.5%, 34.5% and 22% respectively. Pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus was found in 28.5% of carious lesion samples compared to 15.5% in the control. Frequency of Porphyromonas endodontali, Actinomyces radicidentis and Treponema denticola recovery did not differ significantly between origins of samples. PCR analysis of genomic DNA detect various oral bacteria that differ between caries actives and caries-free children. In addition, the association of same aciduric bacteria (S. mutans, S. salivarius, L. acidophilus) and caries formation was noticed.
TI  - The influence of a glucosyltransferase, encoded by gtfP, on biofilm formation by  Streptococcus sanguinis in a dual-species model.
AB  - Streptococcus sanguinis is an early colonizer of tooth surfaces and forms biofilms with other species of microorganisms. In vitro, S. sanguinis produces water-soluble glucans from sucrose and releases them into the culture supernatant; however, the role played by these glucans in biofilm formation is unclear. The present study examined both the effect of glucans on biofilm formation by S. sanguinis and the proportion of this bacterial species within the biofilms. Inactivation of the gtfP gene, annotated as glucosyltransferase in the S. sanguinis genome database, caused a marked reduction in the amount of water-soluble glucans in the culture supernatant, but not in the amount of water-insoluble glucans expressed on the bacterial cell surface. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that wild-type S. sanguinis, but not the gtfP-deficient mutant, produced large amounts of sticky material in the presence of 1% (w/v) sucrose. In addition, biofilm production by wild-type bacteria was greater than that by the mutant strain. By contrast, co-culture of mutant bacteria with Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, S. oralis, S. gordonii, S. anginosus, or S. salivarius showed that inactivating the gtfP gene had little effect on the amount of biofilm produced. Furthermore, inactivating the gtfP gene did not greatly alter the proportion of S. sanguinis in the biofilms formed by the co-cultures. Thus, despite the role of S. sanguinis glucosyltransferase in formation of water-soluble glucans and biofilms in monoculture, the functional gene contributed little to biofilms in co-culture experiments.
TI  - Effective oral health in infective endocarditis: efficacy of high-street mouthwashes against the viridans group streptococci.
AB  - AIM: Recent UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines state that there is no longer a need for oral antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing dental procedures who are at risk of infective endocarditis (IE), and advocate the importance of maintaining good oral health. As viridans group streptococci (VGS) are common etiological agents of IE and inhabitants of the mouth, the purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of common high-street mouthwashes against four classes of VGS organisms (salivarius, mitis, anginosus, and mutans groupings). METHODS: The survival of VGS, Streptococcus gordonii (National Collection of Type Cultures [NCTC] 7865), Streptococcus intermedius (NCTC 11324), Streptococcus mutans (NCTC 10449), Streptococcus oralis (NCTC 11427), Streptococcus pneumoniae (NCTC 7465, NCTC 7978, & American Type Culture Collection 49619) and Streptococcus salivarius (NCTC 8618) was assessed in vitro following treatment of approximately 10(7) c.f.u. in planktonic state with four mouthwashes. RESULTS: No organisms were culturable following 1-min exposure, and were not recovered following non-selective enrichment following incubation in Brain Heart Infusion broth supplemented with 0.8% (w/v) yeast extract. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that such mouthwashes are able to completely kill VGS organisms tested in planktonic solution, where their use would promote good oral hygiene in patients at risk of IE.
TI  - Caries experience, mutans streptococci and total protein concentrations in children with protein-energy undernutrition.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The highest prevalence of protein-energy undernutrition is observed during early childhood, being also a time in which the presence of dental caries can be unusually aggressive. The present study aimed to verify if different levels of undernutrition could influence the risk of early childhood caries (ECC), in the presence of other predisposing factors. METHODS: One hundred and twenty undernourished 12-70 month old children, with or without ECC, were selected. Undernourished children were classified as being mildly, moderately or severely undernourished. All children were examined for determination of decayed, missing and filled surfaces (dmfs). Total protein concentration in saliva was analysed by the Bradford method. For microbiological analysis, mitis salivarius-bacitracin agar medium was used. A binary logistic regression model was applied to test the simultaneous influence of different variables over caries experience. RESULTS: The risk of ECC was significantly higher with an increase in age (p = 0.000) and mutans streptococci counts (p = 0.032). Comparisons with the normal-weight group showed that mildly (p = 0.004) and severely undernourished children (p = 0.037) had a higher risk of experiencing ECC, but this risk was not significantly elevated among moderately undernourished children (p = 0.158). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that mildly and severely undernourished children have an increased risk of experiencing dental caries. Age is highly associated with the disease in this population.
TI  - PCR applications in identification of saliva samples exposed to different conditions (streptococci detection based).
AB  - Oral streptococci represent about 20% of the total oral bacteria, so if it is possible to detect the presence of oral specific bacteria from a forensic specimen by Polymerase chain reaction, this could be used to verify the presence of saliva. Aim of this study is detection of Streptococcus salivarius which is one of the most common streptococci in oral bacteria and Streptococcus mutans which is common in cases of dental caries in various body fluids and skin swabs and assessment of which one of both organisms is more reliable in saliva identification, cross sectional study on Egypt population. Negative control samples (15 samples) were taken from various body fluids (urine, semen) and skin swabs. Mock forensic samples (85 samples) included fresh saliva, saliva, cotton fabrics contaminated with saliva, cigarette butts, bitten apple and semen mixed with saliva samples). DNA extraction was done using DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan). Polymerase chain reaction was done for DNA amplification using Polymerase chain reaction master mix then gel electrophoresis was done for samples qualification. Control bacteria were S. salivarius and Streptococcus mutans. Streptococcus salivarius was detected in 83.5% of all saliva contained samples and S. mutans was detected in 67% of saliva contained samples. Both bacteria were not detected in other body fluids and skin swabs, so S. salivarius is more reliable in saliva identification as well as differentiating it from other body fluids. Polymerase chain reaction is valuable in detection of saliva by detecting S. salivarius.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of selected glass ionomer cements.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of the paper was to determine the antibacterial activity of four glass ionomer cements against bacteria of the genera Streptococcus and Lactobacillus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four capsulated glass ionomer cements were applied in the study: Fuji Triage (GC), Fuji IX (GC), Ketac Molar (3M Espe) and Ketac Silver (3M Espe). Four standard bacterial strains were used to assess the antibacterial activity of the studied cements: Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, S. salivarius and Lactobacillus casei. The antibacterial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method. The bacterial suspension was spread with a cotton swab on TSA plates. For each material six wells (7 mm diameter, 5 mm deep) were made with a cork borer. Each well was then filled with freshly prepared cements. The results were obtained by measuring the bacterial growth inhibition zone after 1, 2, 3 and 7 days. RESULTS: Fuji Triage cement inhibited the growth of all bacterial strains. Fuji IX cement demonstrated the most potent antibacterial activity against S. sanguis. Ketac Molar showed antibacterial activity against S. sanguis and S. salivarius, whereas Ketac Silver was efficient against S. mutans as well. Neither of the Ketac cements inhibited growth of the standard L. casei strain. DISCUSSION: Antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements has attracted the interest of scientists in recent years. Most authors, including us, carried out experiments using the agar diffusion method and demonstrated antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements. Different antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements, observed in our study and studies of other authors, depended on the evaluated cement, bacterial strain and period of evaluation.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the body wall extracts of sea cucumber (Invertebrata; Echinodermata) on infectious oral streptococci.
AB  - Abstract Background: The present study was carried out to test the antibacterial  effect of the body wall of the sea cucumber Holothuria leucospilota Brandt on Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus salivarius. Methods: After sampling sea cucumbers from the Persian Gulf, different extractions were prepared. Then, aqueous, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.8), chloroform, hexane and methanolic extracts from sea cucumber body wall were screened for antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacteria S. mutans and S. salivarius using the disk diffusion method. Results: The PBS extract did not show any antibacterial or inhibitory activity; the chloroform extract, however, demonstrated high levels of antibacterial activity against S. salivarius while exhibiting low levels of activity against S. mutans. The hexane and methanolic extracts were found to show no antibacterial activity against S. mutans, but exhibited antibacterial activity against S. salivarius. Conclusions: In conclusion, the results demonstrated the possibility of utilizing sea cucumbers as a cheap source of potential antibacterial agents and for treating odontogenic diseases.
TI  - [Evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (SNP's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for therapeutic purposes. It is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal SNP's possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of SNP's against cariogenic bacteria: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus mitis responsible for initiation of dental carries. Tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. Nanotechnology creates a new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. METHODS: Colloidal silver solution (CSS) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. Nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis and S, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs of 7 patients treated for dental carries at Department of Conservative Dentistry, Medical University of Warsaw. MIC and MBC values for CSS's were evaluated. RESULTS: CSS used in this research is of good stability. No agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. Silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. MIC values were: 12-25 ppm for S. salivarius, 25 ppm for S. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for S. mitis and 50 ppm for S. mutans, while MBC values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. After 24 hours of contact MBC values were: 25-50 ppm for S. salivarius and S. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for S. mitis and 200 ppmfor S. mutans. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial properties of CSS depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. The susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. Sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.
TI  - Comparative analysis of colony counts of different species of oral streptococci in saliva of dentulous, edentulous and in those wearing partial and complete dentures.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study and compare the number of colony forming units of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus milleri in dentulous, edentulous and in those wearing partial and complete dentures by using semi-quantitative culture method of saliva samples with calibrated standard loop. MATERIALS: Sterile specimen collection bottles, Mitis salivarius agar plates, Standard loop, Candle jar, Incubator, Colony counter. METHODOLOGY: Study population consisted of 100 subjects with 25 in each group, with an age range of 40 to 80 years, who were attending the Department of Community Dentistry and Prosthodontics at MNR Dental College, Sangareddy, Hyderabad. Unstimulated saliva samples were collected from patients and inoculated on to Mitis salivarius agar plates using calibrated standard loop. The plates were then incubated anaerobically at 37 degrees C for 24 hours and left at room temperature for further 24 hours. Using a colony counter, the number of colonies of each species was counted. RESULTS: Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus mitis predominates in the dentulous group, Streptococcus sanguis in complete denture group, Streptococcus salivarius in edentulous group and Streptococcus milleri in removable partial denture group. CONCLUSION: The results of our study are in accordance with the previous studies, which have sought to differentiate different groups of mutans streptococci using a simple calibrated standard loop.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection  treatment with photolysis of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection treatment with photolysis of H2O2 and comparing this with existing antibacterial agents. We tested seven antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, cefepime hydrochloride, erythromycin, ofloxacin, clindamycin hydrochloride, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, and minocycline hydrochloride, as positive controls for validation of the assay protocol. For all of the agents tested, at least one of the four bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus salivarius) was resistant to these agents by repeated exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the agents up to 10 times. In contrast, antibacterial activity against any of the bacterial species tested (S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. coli, S. salivarius, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus mutans, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) was not affected by repeated exposure to the disinfection treatment up to 40 times. This finding suggested that the risk of inducing bacterial resistance by disinfection treatment was low. The active ingredient of this disinfection treatment is hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis of H2O2. Therefore, hydroxyl radicals interact with several cell structures and different metabolic pathways in microbial cells, probably resulting in a lack of development of bacterial resistance. In conclusion, disinfection treatment with photolysis of H2O2 appears to be a potential alternative for existing antimicrobial agents in terms of a low risk of inducing bacterial resistance.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of a human beta-defensin-3 peptide on multispecies biofilms.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aggregation of mixed bacterial flora into sessile biofilms on root canal surfaces can be one of the causes of persistent apical periodontitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of human beta-defensin-3 (HBD3) peptide on multispecies biofilms by using confocal laser scanning microscopy. METHODS: Actinomyces naeslundii, Lactobacillus salivarius, Streptococcus mutans, and Enterococcus faecalis were cultured in a peptone-yeast-glucose broth, and their culture suspensions were combined in equal proportions. The mixed bacteria were inoculated on sterile coverslips placed into the wells of tissue culture plates to permit the formation of mixed species biofilm. After incubation for 3 weeks, the samples were treated for 24 hours with saline (control), saturated calcium hydroxide solution (CH), 2% chlorhexidine solution (CHX), and 50 mug/mL HBD3 solution. A commercial biofilm/viability assay kit was used to assess cell viability and analyze the 3-dimensional architecture of biofilms. The percentage of dead cells was determined from the ratio of biovolumes for the red subpopulation and the total biofilm. RESULTS: Three medication groups showed a significant reduction of biovolume within the biofilms compared with the control group (P < .001). The HBD3-treated biofilms had a higher percentage of dead cells than the other medication groups (P < .05). The CH and CHX groups showed higher levels of bactericidal activity than saline (P < .05), and there was no significant difference between the 2 groups (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: HBD3 peptide exhibited more antibacterial activity against mature multispecies biofilms in vitro than either CH or CHX.
TI  - Phenotypic diversity of multicellular filamentation in oral Streptococci.
AB  - Filamentous multicellular bacteria are among the most ancient multicellular organisms. They inhabit a great variety of environments and are present in the human body, including the oral cavity. Beside the selective advantages related to the larger size achieved through filamentation, the development of multicellular bacteria can be also driven by simple ecological factors such as birth and death rates at the cellular level. In order to extend earlier results obtained in aquatic species, we investigate the filamentation process of four different strains of oral streptococci, namely S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. oralis and S. anginosus. The results indicate differences in the capacities of different streptococcus species to form filaments, manifested in terms of length and the time-scale of filament elongation. The filamentation pattern of these oral streptococci resembles that of aquatic bacteria, whereby filaments reach a peak length during exponential growth and become short when the population reaches a steady state. Hence, this study validates that multicellularity can be an emergent property of filamentous bacteria of different ecological niches, and that phenotypic differences in filamentation can occur within species of the same genus, in this case oral streptococci. Moreover, given the role that specific oral streptococci can play in the etiology of oral diseases, these results can possibly open new perspectives in the study of the virulence properties of these species.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of the antibacterial effects of four dentine bonding systems: An in vitro study.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate and the compare antibacterial efficacy of four dentin bonding system against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius and Lactobacillus acidophilus over a period of three months using agar disk diffusion test. METHODOLOGY: All the three standard bacterial strains were inoculated into BHI broth and incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 hours. A 100 mul of broth suspension containing aliquots of S. mutans, S. salivarius and L. acidophilus were spread onto M-H agar medium using sterile cotton swabs. The experimental groups were as follows: GROUP A: Test conducted for evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy against S. mutans MTCC 497, GROUP B: Test conducted for evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy against S. salivarius MTCC 1938, and GROUP C: Test conducted for evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy against L. acidophilus MTCC 447. For sample preparation, 20 mul bonding agent was dropped with micropipettes on paper disks, and blown dry for 10 seconds. Then it was light-cured at 2 mm for 20 sec using a QTH visible light curing unit. For first reading, the sample disks were placed over the freshly inoculated agar plates and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 hours. The rest of the paper disks were stored in dark, submerged in distilled water at 37 degrees C. They were placed on freshly inoculated spread plates after specific time intervals- 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months after ageing in PBS. After incubation, the diameters of zones of inhibition around the plates were measured. The experiment was performed twice in triplicate. The data was then statistically analysed using Two way ANOVA test and post hoc. RESULTS: Results showed that Xeno III had the maximum antibacterial efficacy over a period of three months, followed by XP bond. This antibacterial activity was maximum against Streptococcus mutans, followed by Lactobacillus acidophilus and least against Streptococcus salivarius. Adper Easy One and G bond had minimal effect against the test bacteria during the test period. CONCLUSION: The antibacterial effect decreased over a period of three months for all the dentin bonding systems.
TI  - In vitro antagonistic growth effects of Lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus salivarius and their fermentative broth on periodontal pathogens.
AB  - As lactobacilli possess an antagonistic growth property, these bacteria may be beneficial as bioprotective agents for infection control. However, whether the antagonistic growth effects are attributed to the lactobacilli themselves or their fermentative broth remains unclear. The antagonistic growth effects of Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus fermentum as well as their fermentative broth were thus tested using both disc agar diffusion test and broth dilution method, and their effects on periodontal pathogens, including Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis in vitro at different concentrations and for different time periods were also compared. Both Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus fermentum and their concentrated fermentative broth were shown to inhibit significantly the growth of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, although different inhibitory effects were observed for different pathogens. The higher the counts of lactobacilli and the higher the folds of concentrated fermentative broth, the stronger the inhibitory effects are observed. The inhibitory effect is demonstrated to be dose-dependent. Moreover, for the lactobacilli themselves, Lactobacillus fermentum showed stronger inhibitory effects than Lactobacillus salivarius. However, the fermentative broth of Lactobacillus fermentum showed weaker inhibitory effects than that of Lactobacillus salivarius. These data suggested that lactobacilli and their fermentative broth exhibit antagonistic growth activity, and consumption of probiotics or their broth containing lactobacilli may benefit oral health.
TI  - Analysis of cariogenic bacteria in saliva of cancer patients.
AB  - This study examined salivary flow and salivary pH and the prevalence and levels of cariogenic bacteria in the saliva of oncological patients and healthy controls. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to assess the levels of microbes including Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Lactobacillus acidophilus in the saliva of 41 patients with a solid tumor (SO), 30 patients with a hematologic malignancy (HE), and 40 healthy controls. Salivary flow and pH were lower in oncological patients than in controls. The frequencies of all four cariogenic bacteria were highest in the SO group. S. mutans and L. salivarius were the most commonly detected in all three study groups. Mean numbers of S. sobrinus and L. salivarius in the SO group were significantly higher than in controls (p<0.05). There were no significant differences between patients and controls with respect to mean numbers of S. mutans and L. acidophilus in saliva. However, the proportions of S. mutans, S. sobrinus, and L. salivarius versus total bacteria in the SO group were significantly higher than in controls. Within patients, both mean numbers and the proportions of S. mutans and S. sobrinus were significantly different (p<0.05). In summary, significant differences were found in salivary pH values and the levels of S. mutans, S. sobrinus, and L. salivarius between SO patients and healthy controls.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of herbal extracts on Streptococcus mutans and normal oral  streptococci.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans is associated with dental caries. A cariogenic biofilm, in particular, has been studied extensively for its role in the formation of dental caries. Herbal extracts such as Cudrania tricuspidata, Sophora flavescens, Ginkgo biloba, and Betula Schmidtii have been used as a folk remedy for treating diseases. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial activity of herbal extracts against normal oral streptococci, planktonic and biofilm of S. mutans. Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguinis, and S. mutans were cultivated with brain heart infusion broth and susceptibility assay for the herbal extracts was performed according to the protocol of Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute. Also, S. mutans biofilm was formed on a polystyrene 12-well plate and 8-well chamber glass slip using BHI broth containing 2% sucrose and 1% mannose after conditioning the plate and the glass slip with unstimulated saliva. The biofilm was treated with the herbal extracts in various concentrations and inoculated on Mitis-Salivarius bacitracin agar plate for enumeration of viable S. mutans by counting colony forming units. Planktonic S. mutans showed susceptibility to all of the extracts and S. mutans biofilm exhibited the highest level of sensitivity for the extracts of S. flavescens. The normal oral streptococci exhibited a weak susceptibility in comparison to S. mutans. S. oralis, however, was resistant to all of the extracts. In conclusion, the extract of S. flavescens may be a potential candidate for prevention and management of dental caries.
TI  - A comparative evaluation of Oratest with the microbiological method of assessing  caries activity in children.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study is to find out whether Oratest can be used as a diagnostic tool in assessing the caries activity by evaluating its relationship to the existing caries status and the salivary streptococcus mutans level. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study sample consists of 90 students divided into two groups. Group I (test group) and Group II (control group) consisting of 30 children for control group and 60 children for test group. The sampling of unstimulated saliva for the estimation of streptococcus mutans was done as per the method suggested by Kohler and Bratthall. The plates were then incubated. Rough surface colonies were identified as streptococcus mutans on a pre-determined area of the tip (approximately 1.5 cm(2)) were counted for each side of spatula pressed against mitis salivarius bacitracin agar using digital colony counter. The results were expressed in colony forming units (CFU). Oratest was carried out in the same patients after the collection of salivary sample for the microbiological method to evaluate the relationship between the two tests. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: The tests used were ANOVA, Pearson Chi-square test, Pearson's correlation analysis, Mann-Whitney U test and Student's independent t-test. RESULTS: In the control group and test group, when the streptococcus mutans count (CFU) and Oratest time (minutes) were correlated using Pearson's correlation analysis, the streptococcus mutans counts was found to be in a statistically significant negative linear relationship with the Oratest time. When the caries status of the children, participated in the test group were correlated with mutans count (CFU) and Oratest time, caries status were found to be in a statistically significant positive linear relationship with streptococcus mutans count and in a significant negative linear relationship with Oratest time. CONCLUSIONS: The test proved to be a simple, inexpensive and rapid technique for assessing caries activity since a significant relationship exists clinically with caries status and microbiologically with the streptococcus mutans count of the individual.
TI  - Antibacterial Effect of Juglans Regia Bark against Oral Pathologic Bacteria.
AB  - Background. In this study antimicrobial effect of ethanolic and aqueous extracts  of Juglans regia bark in Iran was evaluated on four different oral bacteria, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Methods. Aqueous and ethanol extracts of Juglans regia bark were prepared by using disk diffusion technique and Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) methods. Tetracycline 30 mu g and Erythromycin 15 mu g were used as positive control and water as negative control in disk diffusion and MIC methods. Data were analyzed by ANOVA test. Results. The results showed that S. sanguis and S. mutans were the most sensitive and the most resistant bacteria against ethanolic and aqueous extracts, respectively. Ethanolic extract had significant antibacterial effect against all tested bacteria. Aqueous extract did not show antibacterial effect on S. mutans, in contrast to ethanolic extract. Aqueous extract had significantly antibacterial effect against Staphylococcus aureus, S. salivarius, and S. sanguis compared to control (P < 0.0001), but it did not show effect on S. mutans when compared with Erythromycin. According to the obtained MIC values, ethanol extract of Juglans regia bark had the lowest rate. Conclusion. The results may provide the basis for using natural antimicrobial substance for oral hygiene prophylaxis purposes.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of different concentrations of garlic (Allium sativum) extract on dental plaque bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Allium sativum, commonly known as garlic, exhibits antibacterial effects against a wide range of bacteria. AIM: The objective of this in vitro study was to assess the antibacterial effect of different concentrations of garlic extract against human dental plaque microbiota. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antibacterial activities of four different concentrations of garlic extract (5%, 10%, 20%, and 100%) were evaluated against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and lactobacillus spp. using the disk diffusion method. Papers soaked in 0.2% concentration chlorhexidine gluconate and saline were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The data were subjected to one-way ANOVA and the Tukey multiple comparisons test at a 5% significance level. RESULTS: All bacterial strains were inhibited by all test materials. The inhibition zones of the different concentrations of garlic extract were not significantly different for S. mutans, S. sanguis, and S. salivarius. For P. aeruginosa and lactobacillus spp. the inhibition zones of 5%, 10% and 20% concentrations were not significantly different from one another, but they were significantly more than that of the 100% extract. CONCLUSION: The 5%, 10%, 20%, and 100% concentrations of garlic extract had similar effects, so further studies seem to be indicated on the usefulness of the 5% extract.
TI  - Revealing anti-cariogenic efficacy of smokeless tobacco: A pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The tobacco plant, Nicotiana tabacum, has been responsible for more deaths than any other herb. However, the literature has also been endowed with its use as "holy herb" since the pre-Columbian era. Used for treating pain, poisonous bites, ulcers, nasal polyps, and basal cell carcinoma; it also acts as an important ingredient of commercially available toothpastes; and even used as tobacco vaccines against Streptococcus species as highlighted in the literature. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: (1) To elicit the anti-microbial property of tobacco against Streptococcus mutans, if any, in raw smokeless tobacco. (2) To study the relationship of duration and growth inhibition efficacy of smokeless tobacco. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Extracts were prepared by centrifugation of mixed raw smokeless tobacco with Ringer's lactate solution and with saliva. The extracts were placed in wells prepared on Mitis salivarius culture plate and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h after 0 h, 1 h, and 2 h of extract preparation. The inhibition zones were measured on the underside of plate using the vernier calipers. RESULTS: Smokeless tobacco has a statistically significant zone of inhibition, which proves its anti-microbial activity against S. mutans. However, the mean zones of inhibition were greater for Ringer's lactate and tobacco group as compared to test samples (saliva and tobacco) with subsequent reduction of inhibition zones with an increase in duration. CONCLUSION: The anti-microbial property of extensive tobacco resources can be utilized from their extracts in order to balance the deterioration it had caused to mankind.
TI  - Effect of metalloporphyrins on red autofluorescence from oral bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the red autofluorescence from bacterial species related to dental caries and periodontitis in the presence of different nutrients in the growth medium. Bacteria were grown anaerobically on tryptic soy agar (TSA) supplemented with nutrients, including magnesium-porphyrins from spinach and iron-porphyrins from heme. The autofluorescence was then assessed at 405 nm excitation. On the TSA without additives, no autofluorescence was observed from any of the species tested. On the TSA containing sheep blood, red autofluorescence was observed only from Parvimonas micra. When the TSA was supplemented with blood, hemin, and vitamin K, red autofluorescence was observed from Actinomyces naeslundii, Bifidobacterium dentium, and Streptococcus mutans. Finally, on the TSA supplemented with spinach extract, red autofluorescence was observed from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, A. naeslundii, Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus salivarius, S. mutans, and Veillonella parvula. We conclude that the bacteria related to dental caries and periodontal disease exhibit red autofluorescence. The autofluorescence characteristics of the tested strains depended on the nutrients present, such as metalloporphyrins, suggesting that the metabolic products of the oral biofilm could be responsible for red autofluorescence.
TI  - Inhibition of attachment of oral bacteria to immortalized human gingival fibroblasts (HGF-1) by tea extracts and tea components.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tea has been suggested to promote oral health by inhibiting bacterial attachment to the oral cavity. Most studies have focused on prevention of bacterial attachment to hard surfaces such as enamel. FINDINGS: This study investigated the effect of five commercial tea (green, oolong, black, pu-erh and chrysanthemum) extracts and tea components (epigallocatechin gallate and gallic acid) on the attachment of five oral pathogens (Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35668, Streptococcus mitis ATCC 49456, Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419 and Actinomyces naeslundii ATCC 51655) to the HGF-1 gingival cell line. Extracts of two of the teas (pu-erh and chrysanthemum) significantly (p < 0.05) reduced attachment of all the Streptococcus strains by up to 4 log CFU/well but effects of other teas and components were small. CONCLUSIONS: Pu-erh and chrysanthemum tea may have the potential to reduce attachment of oral pathogens to gingival tissue and improve the health of oral soft tissues.
TI  - Colonization of Streptococcus mutans on esthetic brackets: self-ligating vs conventional.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Self-ligating orthodontic brackets rely on clips, rather than ligatures, to hold the archwire in place. It is unknown whether replacing ligatures with clips affects the adherence of Streptococcus mutans. The aim of this research was to evaluate whether self-ligating brackets have an advantage over conventional brackets as determined by the adherence of S mutans. METHODS: The sample consisted of 50 esthetic brackets, divided into 3 experimental groups and 2 control groups of 10 brackets each. Two experimental groups were active self-ligating brackets (QuicKlear; Forestadent, Pforzheim, Germany; and In-Ovation C; Dentsply GAC, Bohemia, NY); the other was a passive self-ligating bracket (Damon 3; Ormco, Glendora, Calif). The 2 control groups were conventional brackets (Mystique; Dentsply GAC; and Clarity; 3M Unitek, Monrovia, Calif). The brackets were randomly bonded to the canines, first and second premolars, and first and second molars in the mandibular left hemiarch of 10 male participants. Biofilm was collected from the tooth surfaces before bonding and from the brackets on day 21 and placed in Petri dishes containing Mitis salivarius agar. The brackets were removed on day 28 and examined by using scanning electron microscopy. Statistical analysis, analysis of variance, and the Tukey correction with a P value of 0.05 were used. RESULTS: The greatest numbers of colonies were found in an active self-ligating bracket group (In-Ovation C), and the fewest colonies were in a conventional bracket group (Clarity). The largest colonies formed on active self-ligating brackets. In the slot, the greatest formation was in a control group (Mystique). CONCLUSIONS: Self-ligating esthetic brackets do not promote greater or lesser S mutans colonization when compared with conventional brackets. Differences were found to be related to the material composition of the bracket.
TI  - Insight into the evolution of the histidine triad protein (HTP) family in Streptococcus.
AB  - The Histidine Triad Proteins (HTPs), also known as Pht proteins in Streptococcus  pneumoniae, constitute a family of surface-exposed proteins that exist in many pathogenic streptococcal species. Although many studies have revealed the importance of HTPs in streptococcal physiology and pathogenicity, little is known about their origin and evolution. In this study, after identifying all htp homologs from 105 streptococcal genomes representing 38 different species/subspecies, we analyzed their domain structures, positions in genome, and most importantly, their evolutionary histories. By further projecting this information onto the streptococcal phylogeny, we made several major findings. First, htp genes originated earlier than the Streptococcus genus and gene-loss events have occurred among three streptococcal groups, resulting in the absence of the htp gene in the Bovis, Mutans and Salivarius groups. Second, the copy number of htp genes in other groups of Streptococcus is variable, ranging from one to four functional copies. Third, both phylogenetic evidence and domain structure analyses support the division of two htp subfamilies, designated as htp I and htp II. Although present mainly in the pyogenic group and in Streptococcus suis, htp II members are distinct from htp I due to the presence of an additional leucine-rich-repeat domain at the C-terminus. Finally, htp genes exhibit a faster nucleotide substitution rate than do housekeeping genes. Specifically, the regions outside the HTP domains are under strong positive selection. This distinct evolutionary pattern likely helped Streptococcus to easily escape from recognition by host immunity.
TI  - Inhibitory effect on Streptococcus mutans and mechanical properties of the chitosan containing composite resin.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the antibacterial effect and mechanical properties of composite resins (LCR, MCR, HCR) incorporating chitosan with three different molecular weights (L, Low; M, Medium; H, High). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Streptococcus (S). mutans 100 mL and each chitosan powder were inoculated in sterilized 10 mL Brain-Heart Infusion (BHI) solution, and was centrifuged for 12 hr. Absorbance of the supernatent was measured at OD660 to estimate the antibacterial activities of chitosan. After S. mutans was inoculated in the disc shaped chitosan-containing composite resins, the disc was cleansed with BHI and diluted with serial dilution method. S. mutans was spread on Mitis-salivarius bacitracin agar. After then, colony forming unit (CFU) was measured to verify the inhibitory effect on S. mutans biofilm. To ascertain the effect on the mechanical properties of composite resin, 3-point bending and Vickers hardness tests were done after 1 and 3 wk water storage, respectively. Using 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Scheffe test, statistical analysis was done with 95% significance level. RESULTS: All chitosan powder showed inhibition effect against S. mutans. CFU number in chitosan-containing composite resins was smaller than that of control resin without chitosan. The chitosan containing composite resins did not show any significant difference in flexural strength and Vickers hardness in comparison with the control resin. However, the composite resin, MCR showed a slightly decreased flexural strength and the maximum load than those of control and the other composite resins HCR and LCR. CONCLUSIONS: LCR and HCR would be recommended as a feasible antibacterial restorative due to its antibacterial nature and mechanical properties.
TI  - Early in vitro and in vivo development of high-level daptomycin resistance is common in mitis group Streptococci after exposure to daptomycin.
AB  - The development of high-level daptomycin resistance (HLDR; MIC of >/= 256 mg/liter) after exposure to daptomycin has recently been reported in viridans group streptococcus (VGS) isolates. Our study objectives were as follows: to know whether in vitro development of HLDR after exposure to daptomycin was common among clinical isolates of VGS and Streptococcus bovis; to determine whether HLDR also developed during the administration of daptomycin to treat experimental endocarditis caused by the daptomycin-susceptible, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus mitis strain S. mitis 351; and to establish whether combination with gentamicin prevented the development of HLDR in vitro and in vivo. In vitro studies were performed with 114 VGS strains (mitis group, 92; anginosus group, 10; mutans group, 8; and salivarius group, 4) and 54 Streptococcus bovis strains isolated from 168 consecutive patients with infective endocarditis diagnosed between 1995 and 2010. HLDR was only observed after 24 h of exposure to daptomycin in 27% of the mitis group, including 27% of S. mitis isolates, 47% of S. oralis isolates, and 13% of S. sanguis isolates. In our experimental model, HLDR was detected in 7/11 (63%) and 8/12 (67%) isolates recovered from vegetations after 48 h of daptomycin administered at 6 mg/kg of body weight/24 h and 10 mg/kg/24 h, respectively. In vitro, time-kill experiments showed that daptomycin plus gentamicin was bactericidal against S. mitis 351 at tested concentrations of 0.5 and 1 times the MIC and prevented the development of HLDR. In vivo, the addition of gentamicin at 1 mg/kg/8 h to both daptomycin arms prevented HLDR in 21 out of 23 (91%) rabbits. Daptomycin plus gentamicin was at least as effective as vancomycin plus gentamicin. In conclusion, HLDR develops rapidly and frequently in vitro and in vivo among mitis group streptococci. Combining daptomycin with gentamicin enhanced its activity and prevented the development of HLDR in most cases.
TI  - Organo-selenium-containing dental sealant inhibits bacterial biofilm.
AB  - Oral bacteria, including Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus salivarius, contribute to tooth decay and plaque formation; therefore, it is essential to develop strategies to prevent dental caries and plaque formation. We recently showed that organo-selenium compounds covalently attached to different biomaterials inhibited bacterial biofilms. Our current study investigates the efficacy of an organo-selenium dental sealant (SeLECT-Defense(TM) sealant) in inhibiting S. mutans and S. salivarius biofilm formation in vitro. The organo-selenium was synthesized and covalently attached to dental sealant material via standard polymer chemistry. By colony-forming unit (CFU) assay and confocal microscopy, SeLECT-Defense(TM) sealant was found to completely inhibit the development of S. mutans and S. salivarius biofilms. To assess the durability of the anti-biofilm effect, we soaked the SeLECT-Defense(TM) sealant in PBS for 2 mos at 37 degrees C and found that the biofilm-inhibitory effect was not diminished after soaking. To determine if organo-selenium inhibits bacterial growth under the sealant, we placed SeLECT-Defense sealant over a lawn of S. mutans. In contrast to a control sealant, SeLECT-Defense(TM) sealant completely inhibited the growth of S. mutans. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of SeLECT-Defense(TM) sealant against S. mutans and S. salivarius biofilms is very effective and durable.
TI  - Influence of the probiotic Streptococcus salivarius strain M18 on indices of dental health in children: a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  - The prevalence of dental caries continues to increase, and novel strategies to reverse this trend appear necessary. The probiotic Streptococcus salivarius strain M18 offers the potential to confer oral health benefits as it produces bacteriocins targeting the important cariogenic species Streptococcus mutans, as well as the enzymes dextranase and urease, which could help reduce dental plaque accumulation and acidification, respectively. In a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 100 dental caries-active children, treatment with M18 was administered for 3 months and the participants were assessed for changes to their plaque score and gingival and soft-tissue health and to their salivary levels of S. salivarius, S. mutans, lactobacilli, beta-haemolytic streptococci and Candida species. At treatment end, the plaque scores were significantly (P = 0.05) lower for children in the M18-treated group, especially in subjects having high initial plaque scores. The absence of any significant adverse events supported the safety of the probiotic treatment. Cell-culture analyses of sequential saliva samples showed no differences between the probiotic and placebo groups in counts of the specifically enumerated oral micro-organisms, with the exception of the subgroup of the M18-treated children who appeared to have been colonized most effectively with M18. This subgroup exhibited reduced S. mutans counts, indicating that the anti-caries activity of M18 probiotic treatments may be enhanced if the efficiency of colonization is increased. It was concluded that S. salivarius M18 can provide oral health benefits when taken regularly.
TI  - A defined-multispecies microbial model for studying enamel caries development.
AB  - The aims of this study were to describe and validate an in vitro multispecies microbial biofilm model for caries development by evaluating the effects of varying medium concentration of sucrose (0.5 and 1.0%) and fluoride (0.4, 0.8 and 1.0 ppm F) in study 1, and calcium (1.0 and 2.0 mM Ca) in study 2. Defined-multispecies biofilms, formed by Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus mutans, S. salivarius and S. sanguinis, were grown on the surface of salivary-pellicle-coated enamel slabs, with known baseline surface hardness; growth medium was changed daily. Counts of viable cells on biofilms and the percentage of surface microhardness change (%SMC), lesion depth (LD) and integrated mineral loss (IML) on enamel slabs were assessed after 4 days of biofilm formation under the tested conditions. Counts of viable cells on biofilms were significantly affected by sucrose, fluoride and calcium concentrations (p < 0.05). There was a decrease in %SMC in response to increased fluoride and calcium concentrations (p < 0.001). Lower IML (p < 0.001) and LD (p < 0.05) were found in the presence of 0.8 and 1.0 ppm F. A negative correlation was found between the response variables (%SMC, LD and IML) and fluoride and calcium concentrations. The results suggest that the microbial caries model developed was able to show distinct levels of caries inhibition in response to fluoride and calcium concentrations, corroborating clinical observations. An effect of sucrose concentration on caries development was found only in the presence of the lowest fluoride concentration.
TI  - The efficacy of neem extract on four microorganisms responsible for causing dental caries viz Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis: an in vitro study.
AB  - HISTORY AND OBJECTIVES: From the ancient time, neem used to be the traditional medicine for many diseases and was mainly used for cleaning the oral cavity. The incidence of dental caries was less a few decades ago but now the incidence of caries is very aggressive. This might be due to change in dietary habits, life style and more tendency toward processed food. The objective of this study is to find out the truth that if the neem is really efficacious against caries-inducing microorganisms, mainly Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dried neem sticks ground into a coarse powder and weighed into 5, 10 and 50 gm were added to 100 ml of deionized double distilled water. After soaking for 2 days, the water was filtered at 4 degrees C and the fine filtrate was inoculated onto blood agar plates contains individual species of microorganisms and incubated at 37 degrees C for 2 days. RESULTS: At maximum concentrations, neem extract has shown the maximum zone of inhibition on Streptococcus mutans. At less concentration, the efficacy of neem has shown some inhibition of growth for all the four species of microorganisms. CONCLUSION: Neem chewing provides the maximum benefits. Hence, the use of chewing sticks of neem can be recommended.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the synthetic peptide Lys-a1 against oral streptococci.
AB  - The peptide LYS-[TRP(6)]-Hy-A1 (Lys-a1) is a synthetic derivative of the peptide  Hy-A1, initially isolated from the frog species Hypsiboas albopunctatus. According to previous research, it is a molecule with broad antimicrobial activity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the synthetic peptide Lys-a1 (KIFGAIWPLALGALKNLIK-NH2) on the planktonic and biofilm growth of oral bacteria. The methods used to evaluate antimicrobial activity include the following: determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) in microtiter plates for growth in suspension and quantification of biomass by crystal violet staining and counting of colony forming units for biofilm growth. The microorganisms Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus were grown in Brain Heart Infusion broth at 37 degrees C under atmospheric pressure with 10% CO2. The peptide was solubilized in 0.1% acetic acid (v/v) at various concentrations (500-1.9 mug mL(-1)). Chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12% was used as the positive control, and BHI culture medium was used as the negative control. The tested peptide demonstrated a remarkable antimicrobial effect, inhibiting the planktonic and biofilm growth of all strains tested, even at low concentrations. Thus, the peptide Lys-a1 is an important source for potential antimicrobial agents, especially for the control and prevention of microbial biofilms, which is one of the most important factors in cariogenic processes.
TI  - In-vitro activity of saponins of bauhinia purpurea, madhuca longifolia, celastrus paniculatus and semecarpus anacardium on selected oral pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dental caries, periodontitis and other mucosal diseases are caused by  a complex community of microorganisms. This study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial properties of saponins of four important oil yielding medicinal plant extracts on selected oral pathogens that are involved in such diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Saponins were extracted from Bauhinia purpurea, Madhuca longifolia, Celastrus paniculatus and Semecarpus anacardium and purified. Antimicrobial properties of these saponins against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus salivarius, Staphylococcus aureus and Lactobacillus acidophilus were determined using well diffusion method. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined as the lowest concentration of saponins inhibiting bacterial growth after 14 h of incubation at 37 degrees C. The bactericidal activity was evaluated using the viable cell count method. RESULTS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of Madhuca longifolia saponin on Streptococcus mutans MTCC 890, Streptococcus mitis and Staphylococcus aureus was 18.3 +/- 0.15/34.4 +/- 0.24 mug/ml, 19.0 +/- 0.05/32.2 +/- 0.0 mug/ml and 21.2 +/- 0.35/39.0 +/- 0.30 mug/ml, respectively and Bauhinia purpurea saponin on Streptococcus mutans MTCC 890, Staphylococcus aureus and Lactobacillus acidophilus was 26.4 +/- 0.20/43.0 +/- 0.40 mug/ml, 29.0 +/- 0.30/39.6 +/- 0.12 mug/ml and 20.2 +/- 0.05/36.8 +/- 0.23 mug/ml, respectively. CONCLUSION: The strong antimicrobial activity of Madhuca longifolia and Bauhinia purpurea may be due to the presence of complex triterpenoid saponins, oleanane type triterpenoid glycosides or atypical pentacyclic triterpenoid saponin. Hence, these extracted saponins may be used in food and oral products to prevent and control oral diseases.
TI  - Enantiomeric HPLC resolution and absolute stereochemistry assignment of a new poligamain derivative.
AB  - A new aryltetralin lignan derivative, 1, was obtained by reacting dimethyl succinate and piperonal, furnishing the lactone 4-(3',4'-methylenedioxybenzyl)-4,5-dihydro-2(3H)-furanone, which was reacted once again with piperonal and LDA to give the dibenzylbutirolactone 7-hydroxyhinokinin. The cyclization of 7-hydroxyhinokinin into polygamain occurred in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid. The reduction of the furanic ring of polygamain was done by its reaction with DIBAL in THF, furnishing the diol functionalized lignin derivative 1 as single diastereomer. The enantiomeric fractions of 1 were obtained by preparative enantioselective HPLC. The absolute stereochemistry was assigned by electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. An all-trans relative configuration was determined by NMR on the bases of (1)H coupling constants and nuclear Overhauser effect (n.O.e.) experiments. The absolute configuration at C1 was assigned on the basis of the ECD sign at 296 nm by comparison to the ECD spectra of structural analogues with defined stereochemistry. The assignment of the absolute configuration was confirmed by applying the exciton chirality method to the well-defined ECD couplets at 285 and 200 nm allied to the two electronic transitions L(b) and B(b) of the aromatic moieties, respectively. Rac-1 and its enantiomeric isomers were evaluated against important bacteria responsible for dental caries. The best results obtained for the (1R,2S,3S) isomer were against Streptococcus mutans (250 muM), Streptococcus salivarius (250 muM), Streptococcus sobrinus (280 muM) and Streptococcus mitis (280 muM). The (1S,2R,3R) isomer was active only against Streptococcus sanguinis (280 muM). The enantiomeric mixture was less active than the (1R,2S,3S) isomer.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of mouth washes and herbal products against dental biofilm-forming bacteria.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate in vitro, the antimicrobial effect of Cymbopogon citrates (lemon grass), Plectranthusamboinicus (Mexican mint) and Conyzabonariensis (hairy fleabane) tinctures as well as pure and diluted commercial mouth washes (Malvatricin((R)), Periogard((R)) and Listerine((R))) on wild isolates of Streptococcusmutans and reference strains of S. mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus oralis and Lactobacillus casei by determination of minimum inhibitory dilution (MID). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 0.12% chlorhexidine and 70% corn alcohol were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Saliva samples were collected from 3 volunteers and seeded in MSB broth to obtain Streptococcus isolates after 72-hour incubation. Using the agar diffusion method, susceptibility tests were performed with overnight incubation in microaerophilia at 37 degrees C. All tests were performed in duplicate. RESULTS: The bacterial species were resistant to the tinctures and Listerine((R)), but were susceptible to 0.12% chlorhexidine, Malvatricin((R)) and Periogard((R)), with MIDs ranging from 12.5% to 1.56%. CONCLUSIONS: Plectrantusamboinicus, Conyzabonariensis and Cymbopongoncitratus tinctures and Listerine((R)) did not show inhibitory action against the tested biofilm-forming bacteria.
TI  - Comparative study on the microbial adhesion to preveneered and stainless steel crowns.
AB  - CONTEXT: The extensive plaque formation on dental restorations may contribute to  secondary caries or periodontal inflammation. Therefore, it is important to know how different types of dental restorations may prevent or promote the accumulation of microorganisms. AIMS: The aim of this in vivo study was to evaluate the adhesion of Streptococcus mutans to preveneered and stainless steel crowns (SSCs) and to evaluate the effects of these restorations on the gingival health and oral hygiene. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients (age 3-5 years) were selected from the outpatient clinic of the pedodontics department, Faculty of Oral and Dental Medicine, Cairo University. The selected patients had (dmf) index for primary dentition </=4, including lower right and left first primary molars. Each tooth was pulpotomy-treated and restored with either type of crowns (split-mouth technique). Then, ten swabs from the buccal mucosa, preveneered crown, and SSC surfaces were taken from each patient. Also, the gingival index (GI) and oral hygiene index (OHI-S) were measured at different times during the study. Mitis Salivarius Bacitracin agar (MSBA) was used as a selective medium for S. mutans growth. MSBA plates were taken in candle jar and incubated aerobically in 37 degrees C for 48 h. Finally, bacteria were counted and expressed in colony forming unit (CFU). RESULTS: After 1, 2, and 4 weeks, mucosa and crown swabs of preveneered crown showed statistically significant higher mean CFU counts than SSC. Through the whole study period, the two restorations revealed a statistically significant decrease in mean CFU counts. Also, there was a statistically significant positive (direct) correlation between OHI-S, GI, and S. mutans counts on both restorations. CONCLUSIONS: The adhesion of S. mutans to preveneered crowns was higher than to SSC. Full mouth rehabilitation led to significant decrease in S. mutans count in the short term. An increase in S. mutans counts is associated with an increase in OHI-S and GI.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly Irish subjects.
AB  - AIMS: To isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. METHODS AND RESULTS: Screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects, using the indicator organisms Lactobacillus bulgaricus LMG 6901 and Listeria innocua DPC 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. Genomic fingerprinting following ApaI digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. The antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. The predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus crispatus and Enterococcus spp. A number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including ABP-118 and salivaricin B (from Lact. salivarius), enterocin B (Enterococcus faecium), lactacin B (Lact. acidophilus), gassericin T and a variant of gassericin A (Lact. gasseri), were identified. Interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: Lactococcus lactis producing nisin Z and Streptococcus mutans producing mutacin II. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results presented are important due to growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.
TI  - Recovery of mutans streptococci on MSB, SB-20 and SB-20M agar media.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The recovery of mutans streptococci in saliva and dental biofilm samples depends, in part, on the culture medium used. In this study, we compared (i) the culture media Sucrose-Bacitracin agar (SB-20), Modified SB-20 (SB-20M) and Mitis Salivarius Bacitracin agar (MSB) in the count of colony forming units (cfu) of mutans streptococci and (ii) in the morphological and biochemical differentiation between Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus. DESIGN: Samples of non-stimulated saliva from 20 children were plated on SB-20, SB-20M and MSB, and incubated in microaerophilia at 37 degrees C for 72h. Identification of microorganisms was based on analysis of colony morphology under stereomicroscopy. The biochemical identification of colonies was done by biochemical tests using sugar fermentation, resistance to bacitracin and hydrogen peroxide production. RESULTS: There was no significant difference (p>0.05) in the number of cfu of mutans streptococci recovered on SB-20 and SB-20M agar. Comparing the media, SB-20 and SB-20M yielded a larger number of mutans streptococci colonies (p<0.05) and were more effective than MSB in the identification of S. sobrinus (p<0.05), but not of S. mutans (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference between SB-20 and SB-20M culture media in the count of mutans streptococci, demonstrating that the replacement of sucrose by coarse granular cane sugar did not alter the efficacy of the medium. Compared with MSB, SB-20 and SB-20M allowed counting a larger number of mutans streptococci colonies and a more effective morphological identification of S. sobrinus.
TI  - Beyond Streptococcus mutans: dental caries onset linked to multiple species by 16S rRNA community analysis.
AB  - Dental caries in very young children may be severe, result in serious infection,  and require general anesthesia for treatment. Dental caries results from a shift within the biofilm community specific to the tooth surface, and acidogenic species are responsible for caries. Streptococcus mutans, the most common acid producer in caries, is not always present and occurs as part of a complex microbial community. Understanding the degree to which multiple acidogenic species provide functional redundancy and resilience to caries-associated communities will be important for developing biologic interventions. In addition, microbial community interactions in health and caries pathogenesis are not well understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate bacterial community profiles associated with the onset of caries in the primary dentition. In a combination cross-sectional and longitudinal design, bacterial community profiles at progressive stages of caries and over time were examined and compared to those of health. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used for bacterial community analysis. Streptococcus mutans was the dominant species in many, but not all, subjects with caries. Elevated levels of S. salivarius, S. sobrinus, and S. parasanguinis were also associated with caries, especially in subjects with no or low levels of S. mutans, suggesting these species are alternative pathogens, and that multiple species may need to be targeted for interventions. Veillonella, which metabolizes lactate, was associated with caries and was highly correlated with total acid producing species. Among children without previous history of caries, Veillonella, but not S. mutans or other acid-producing species, predicted future caries. Bacterial community diversity was reduced in caries as compared to health, as many species appeared to occur at lower levels or be lost as caries advanced, including the Streptococcus mitis group, Neisseria, and Streptococcus sanguinis. This may have implications for bacterial community resilience and the restoration of oral health.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of different self-etch adhesives.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antimicrobial activity of different self-etch adhesives by means of the agar disc diffusion test. METHODS: Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans strains were selected to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of various self-etch adhesives (Futurabond NR, G-aenial Bond, Adper Easy Bond Self-Etch Adhesive, Clearfil Protect Bond, One Coat 7.0, Clearfil S3 Bond, Clearfil SE Bond) using the agar disc diffusion test; 0.2% Chlorexidine digluconate was used as control. Paper disks were saturated with 10 microL of each adhesive system and placed onto culture agar plates pre-adsorbed with bacterial cells and further incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees C. The growth inhibition zones around each adhesive were recorded and compared for each bacterial strain. RESULTS: The test results of the various self-etch adhesives were significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present investigation showed that the addition of MDPB monomer to an adhesive system enhances its antibacterial effect against S. salivarius, S. sanguis and S. mutans.
TI  - Evaluation of bacterial adhesion on machined titanium, Osseotite(R) and Nanotite(R) discs.
AB  - PURPOSE: Bacterial adhesion and colonization play a crucial function in the pathogenesis of peri-implant tissue infection, which is considered the main cause of fixture loss. The aim of this study is to evaluate the differences in bacterial adhesion between a machined titanium surface, a double acid etched surface (Osseotite(R)) and an Osseotite surface with Nanometer-scale Discrete Crystalline Deposition (DCD) of calcium phosphate (CaP)(Nanotite(R)). METHODS: Surface roughness properties of each sample were determined by a laser profilometer and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation. Bacterial adhesion on machined, Osseotite(R), and Nanotite(R) discs were performed using the following bacterial strains: Streptococcus mutans CCUG 35176, Streptococcus sanguis CCUG 17826, Streptococcus salivarius CCUG 11878, Actinobacillus actinomycetecomitans CCUG 37002, Porphyromonas gingivalis CCUG 2521. The assessment of bacterial adhesion was performed by comparing two methods: Total Viable Count (TVC) estimation and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopic (CSLM) studies. RESULTS: The surface roughness parameter increased as follows: machined<Nanotite(R)<Osseotite(R). The attachment of all bacterial strains performed by both methods showed a significant reduction on Osseotite(R) and even higher on Nanotite(R) in comparison to machined surfaces (p<0.05). The reduction in bacterial attachment was more significant on Osseotite(R) and Nanotite(R) for A. actinomycetecomitans, S. mutans and S. sanguis than for P. gingivalis and S. salivarius strains. CONCLUSIONS: Nanotite(R) samples showed the lowest amount of bacterial contamination in comparison to the smoother machined and rougher Osseotite(R) surfaces.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of various antibiotics against oral streptococci isolated  in the oral cavity.
AB  - A total of 550 oral streptococci: 270 Streptococcus mitis, 110 Streptococcus sanguis, 90 Streptococcus anginosus, 50 Streptococcus mutans, 30 Streptococcus salivarius, were isolated from dental plaque and gengival crevices of patients and tested for their susceptibility to 12 beta-lactam antibiotics and to 5 non-beta-lactam antibiotics, using the microdiluition method. Overall, a reduced susceptibility to penicillin was recorded in 13.4% of cases. The percentage of strains resistant to penicillin appeared significantly higher in S. mitis (24%) than in S. sanguis (19%), in S. mutans (14%) and in S. salivarius (10%). No levels of penicillin resistance were shown by 90 strains of S. anginosus. In susceptibility test to antibiotics, imipenem was the most active molecule tested, confirming its general good activity against oral streptococci. Also third generation cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone and fourth generation cephalosporins such as cefepime, showed good activity. Chinolones, glycopeptides and rifampicin confirmed a good activity against oral streptococci.
TI  - Antibacterial Activity of Myristica fragrans against Oral Pathogens.
AB  - Myristica fragrans Houtt is mostly cultivated for spices in Penang Island, Malaysia. The ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts of flesh, mace and seed of Myristica fragrans was evaluated the bactericidal potential against three Gram-positive cariogenic bacteria (Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus mitis ATCC 6249, and Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419) and three Gram-negative periodontopathic bacteria (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 29522, Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277, and Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25586). Antibacterial activities of the extracts was determined by twofold serial microdilution, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 1.25 to 640 mg/mL and 0.075 to 40 mg/mL. The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was obtained by subculturing method. Among all extracts tested, ethyl acetate extract of flesh has the highest significant inhibitory effects against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with mean MIC value ranging from 0.625 to 1.25 +/- 0.00 (SD) mg/mL; P = 0.017) and highest bactericidal effects at mean MBC value ranging from 0.625 mg/mL to 20 +/- 0.00 (SD) mg/mL. While for seed and mace of Myristica fragrans, their ethanol extracts exhibited good antibacterial activity against both groups of test pathogens compared to its ethyl acetate extracts. All of the extracts of Myristica fragrans did not show any antibacterial activities against Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25586. Thus, our study showed the potential effect of ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts from flesh, seed and mace of Myristica fragrans to be new natural agent that can be incorporated in oral care products.
TI  - Reduced salivary flow and colonization by mutans streptococci in children with Down syndrome.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although individuals with Down syndrome have considerable oral disease, the prevalence of dental caries in this group is low. The present study aimed to compare known risk factors for dental caries development in children with Down syndrome and a matched population (siblings). In both populations, the number of acidogenic microorganisms, such as mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and Candida species, and the paraffin-stimulated pH, flow rate and IgA concentration in whole saliva were evaluated and compared. METHOD: Saliva was collected, and the caries index was evaluated in 45 sibling pairs aged between 6 and 18 years old. The salivary IgA concentration was determined by immunoturbidimetry. Salivary mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and Candida species were quantified on mitis salivarius agar containing bacitracin and 20% sucrose, rogosa agar supplemented with glacial acetic acid and sabouraud agar supplemented with chloramphenicol, respectively. RESULTS: Down syndrome children had a higher caries-free rate (p<0.05) and lower salivary mutans streptococci counts (p<0.03) compared to their siblings. Similar numbers of lactobacilli and Candida species were found in both groups. Salivary flow rates were 36% lower in Down syndrome children compared to their siblings (p<0.05). The salivary pH did not differ between Down syndrome children and controls. The Down syndrome children had an IgA secretion rate 29% lower than that of their siblings, but this difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the lower number of mutans streptococci in the saliva may be one of the factors contributing to the lower caries rate observed in Down syndrome children, despite evidence of hyposalivation.
TI  - Effect of xylitol on cariogenic and beneficial oral streptococci: a randomized, double-blind crossover trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Although habitual consumption of xylitol reduces cariogenic streptococci levels, its effect on beneficial oral streptococci is less clear. The main aim of the study is to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the oral beneficial streptococci level of saliva, Streptococcus sanguinis and S. mitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty four volunteers with a median age of 23.7 years (range: 20-28) harboring Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, S. sanguinis and S. mitis participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. The experimental chewing gum (1.5 g/pellet) contained 70% xylitol w/w while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol w/w. Saliva samples were collected before and after two three-week test periods with a four-week washout interval. Colony-forming units (CFU)/ml were enumerated for the estimation of S. mutans levels on Mitis Salivarius-Mutans valinomycin (MS-MUTV), S. sobrinus on Mitis Salivarius-Sobrinus (MS-SOB), S. sanguinis on Modified Medium 10-Sucrose (MM10-S) and S. mitis on Mitis Salivarius Agar with Tellurite (MSAT) media. RESULTS: The S. mutans and S. sobrinus counts of the saliva samples decreased significantly (p = 0.01 and p = 0.011, respectively) in the xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. The salivary S. sanguinis and S. mitis counts did not decrease in both xylitol and sorbitol gum groups. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings of this study, xylitol consumption reduced S. mutans and S. sobrinus counts in saliva but appeared not to effect numbers of S. sanguinis and S. mitis in saliva. So, habitual consumption of xylitol reduces cariogenic streptococci levels without any effect on beneficial sterptococci for the oral cavity.
TI  - A novel formulation effective in killing oral biofilm bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if a novel formulation is effective in killing oral biofilm streptococci in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: Efficacy of 0.5% levulinic acid and 0.05% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in killing Streptococcus gordonii CH1, Streptococcus gordonii DL1, Streptococcus mitis NCTC10712, Streptococcus oralis KS32AR, Streptococcus mutans BM71, and Streptococcus mutans GS5 in their biofilm form was measured in vitro, using microtiter plates and subsequent counts on Mitis-Salivarius agar plates. The safety and efficacy in vivo were evaluated using a mouse model. RESULTS: Our anti-microbial formulation completely eliminated all the biofilm streptococcal species tested within 30 seconds (a reduction of 10(7) CFU/ml), whereas the positive control Listerine only demonstrated moderate reduction in vitro. Application of the formulation twice a day for 7 days in the murine oral cavity resulted in significantly more reduction of established S. gordonii DL1 oral biofilm bacteria than Listerine. The formulation did not cause any adverse effect in the murine oral cavity within a 2-week period. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that the novel mouth rinse exhibits high efficacy in killing oral bacteria in their biofilm forms, results in no adverse effect in vivo, and contains alcohol-free components.
TI  - UV-C-irradiation sublethal stress does not alter antibiotic susceptibility of the viridans group streptococci to beta-lactam, macrolide, and fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents.
AB  - AIM: Previous work has indicated that environmental stresses on bacteria might lead to an upregulation of stress response. LED curing lights (315-400 nm) and other UV lights used in tooth whitening cosmetic procedures might act as stresses. We examined the effect of UV-C light, as a high-energy surrogate to the lower-energy UV-A light used in such instruments, to examine its effect on the antibiotic susceptibility of viridans group streptococci. METHODS: Twelve species of viridans group streptococci were examined in this study: Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus australis, Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus infantis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus salivarius, and Streptococcus sanguinis. These organisms were exposed to varying degrees of sublethal UV-C radiation, and their minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility was determined by broth dilution assay against three classes of commonly-used antibiotics: beta-lactams (penicillin), macrolides (erythromycin), and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin). RESULTS: There was no significant difference between antibiotic susceptibility before UV-C exposure and following maximum sublethal stress, prior to cell death due to fatal UV-C exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to UV-C light will not result in altered antibiotic susceptibility patterns on viridans group streptococci. Given that UV-C is more toxic and mutagenic than UV-A light, it is unlikely than UV-A light would yield any difference in response to such exposure.
TI  - A feasible enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against glucosyltransferase-B from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans has been considered the principal etiological agent of dental caries in humans. S. mutans can secrete three kinds of glucosyltransferases (GTFs). One of these, GTF-B, which synthesizes water-insoluble glucans from sucrose, has been considered to be one of the most important factors of cariogenic dental plaque formation. Therefore, determination of whether GTF-B is present in plaque and saliva samples may contribute to the evaluation of individual virulence potential (caries risk). The aim of this study was to develop a feasible enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the routine quantification of GTF-B in plaque-derived cultures and clinical samples, and to apply this assay to an epidemiological study. To determine the presence of GTF-B in plaque samples, a sandwich-ELISA was devised, consisting of mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against GTF-B and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. The developed ELISA allowed for quantification of the amounts of purified GTF-B with satisfactory sensitivity and specificity; this method was not affected by other components such as plaque and saliva. Plaque samples from healthy volunteers were examined using this ELISA method and microbial analysis to apply the assay to an epidemiological study. A correlation was observed between the amount of extracted GTF-B and S. mutans levels as determined by ELISA and cultivated with Mitis Salivarius Bacitracin agar plates derived from plaque samples, although there were some exceptions. In this regard, this ELISA system has the advantage of estimating both the individual numbers of S. mutans and the productivity of GTF-B, namely, the cariogenic potential of S. mutans simultaneously. These results indicate that this ELISA method is a useful tool for the diagnosis of caries risk.
TI  - Purification and genetic characterisation of the novel bacteriocin LS2 produced by the human oral strain Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial potential of Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1, a human oral strain with probiotic characteristics and a broad inhibitory spectrum both against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. Here we present the bacteriocin LS2, an extremely pH- and heat-stable peptide with antilisterial activity. LS2 is a novel member of the class IId bacteriocins, unique among all currently characterised bacteriocins. It is somewhat similar to putative bacteriocins from several oral streptococci, including the cariogenic Streptococcus mutans. LS2 is a 41-amino-acid, highly hydrophobic cationic peptide of 4115.1Da that is sensitive to proteolytic enzymes. LS2 was purified from cells of strain BGHO1 by solvent extraction and reverse-phase chromatography. Mass spectrometry was used to determine the molecular mass of the purified peptide. N-terminal amino acid sequencing enabled identification of the LS2 structural gene bacls2 by a reverse genetics approach. Downstream of the bacls2 gene, two bacteriocin-like genes were found, named blp1a and blp1b, and one putative bacteriocin immunity gene named bimlp. We also present the identification of the 242-kb megaplasmid pMPHO1 by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, which harbours the genes bacls2, blp1a, blp1b and bimlp. Two peptides with antimicrobial activity, whose approximate sizes corresponded to those of blp1a and blp1b, were identified only after culturing strain BGHO1 in a chemically defined medium. This study demonstrated the capacity of Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1 to produce multiple bacteriocins and further established this strain as a promising probiotic candidate.
TI  - Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of Thai oral streptococci, lactobacilli and pediococci.
AB  - This work was to assess the isolation and identification of Thai oral bacteria. Seventeen viridans group streptococci (VGS) and seventeen lactic acid bacteria from saliva were characterization based on their morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics and the 16S RNA gene sequences analysis. The Gram-positive cocci in chains of viridans group comprised of six isolates (Group I) were identified as Streptococcus gordonii, 6 isolates (Group II) were Streptococcus salivarius, 4 isolates (Group III) were Streptococcus sanguis and one isolate (Group IV) was Streptococcus mutans. Seventeen lactic acid bacterial isolates were Gram-positive and catalase negative. They did not contained diaminopimelic acid in the cell wall peptidoglycan. They were divided into four groups, the rod-shaped in Group A (11 isolates) and Group B (2 isolates) which were identified as Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus salivarius, respectively. The tetrad-forming cocci in Group C (3 isolates) and Group D (1 isolate) were identified as Pediococcus acidilactici and P. pentosaceus, respectively.
TI  - Influence of orthodontic treatment on oral streptococci.
AB  - Objective of this study is to evaluate the changes of the oral microbial flora, concentrating on the oral streptococci, after the first 3 and 6 months of orthodontic treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 40 patients, aged 7-17, that presented for orthodontic treatment between April and September 2010 in the Department of Orthodontics and Dento-Facial Orthopedics of "Carol Davila" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest have been selected. According to the protocol, coronary and subgingival plaque was collected from the dental surface before starting any orthodontic treatment (T0), 3 months after wearing orthodontic appliances (T1) and 6 months after wearing orthodontic appliances (T2). The samples were studied in Cantacuzino National Institute of Research-Development for Microbiology and Immunology [isolation on Columbia agar with 5% sheep blood, identification on morphotinctorial, growth and biochemical characteristics using API 20 STREP (BioMerieux)]. Bacterial concentration (colony-forming units/sample = CFU/sample) for the aerobic and anaerobic flora was calculated by the serial dilution method of counting bacteria. RESULTS: 106 strains of oral streptococci were isolated from dental plaque, belonging to 6 species (Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus acidominimus), 37 strains of oral streptococci in patients from group I (T0), 40 strains from group II (T1) and 29 strains of oral streptococci from group III (T2). After 3 months (T1) the aerobic bacteria percentage, detected at a concentration between 10(5) and 10(6), increased from 30 to 38.2%. The percentage of patients with a bacterial concentration higher than 10(6) CFU/sample increased from 5% to 8.8%. The samples colected at T2 (patients examined after 6 months of orthodonic treatment) presented a lower bacterial concentration, as compared to group II (T1). The most common isolated species of streptococci were S. salivarius, S. oralis and S. mutans (37.5%, 22.5% and 10%), whose frequency increased after 3 months of treatment to 41.14%, 32.3% and respectively 14.4%, returning after 6 months of treatment at values similar to those recorded before beginning the orthodontic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Presence of orthodontic appliances may produce a transitory increase of bacterial concentration (CFU/sample) and isolation rate of oral streptococci, returning to the level prior to the application of these devices after a time interval of several months.
TI  - Streptococcus troglodytae sp. nov., from the chimpanzee oral cavity.
AB  - Six strains, TKU 25, TKU 28, TKU 30, TKU 31(T), TKU 33 and TKU 34, were isolated  from the oral cavity of a chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). Colonies of strains grown on Mitis-Salivarius agar were similar in morphology to that of Streptococcus mutans. The novel strains were Gram-stain-positive, facultatively anaerobic cocci that lacked catalase activity. Analysis of the partial 16S rRNA gene sequences of these isolates showed that the most closely related strain was the type strain of S. mutans (96.4 %). The next closely related strains to the isolates were the type strains of Streptococcus devriesei (94.5 %) and Streptococcus downei (93.9 %). These isolates could be distinguished from S. mutans by inulin fermentation and alkaline phosphatase activity (API ZYM system). The peptidoglycan type of the novel isolates was Glu-Lys-Ala(3). Strains were not susceptible to bacitracin. On the basis of phenotypic characterization, partial 16S rRNA gene and two housekeeping gene (groEL and sodA) sequence data, we propose a novel taxon, Streptococcus troglodytae sp. nov.; the type strain is TKU 31(T) ( = JCM 18038(T) = DSM 25324(T)).
TI  - Antimicrobial capacity of Aloe vera and propolis dentifrice against Streptococcus mutans strains in toothbrushes: an in vitro study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated in vitro the efficiency of Aloe vera and propolis dentifrice on reducing the contamination of toothbrush bristles by a standard strain of Streptococcus mutans (ATCC 25175; SM), after toothbrushing. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifteen sterile toothbrushes were randomly divided into 5 toothbrushing groups: I (negative control): without dentifrice; II: with fluoridated dentifrice; III: with triclosan and gantrez dentifrice; IV (positive control): without dentifrice and irrigation with 10 mL of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate; V: with Aloe vera and propolis dentifrice. In each group, 1 sterile bovine tooth was brushed for 1 min, where the toothbrush bristles were contaminated with 25 microL of SM. After toothbrushing, the bristles were stored in individual test tubes with 3 mL of BHI under anaerobiosis of 37 degrees C for 48 h. Then, they were seeded with sterile swab in triplicate in the Mitis salivarius - Bacitracin culture medium. The samples were kept under anaerobiosis of 37 degrees C for 48 h. Scores were used to count the number of colony forming units (cfu). The results were submitted to the Mann-Whitney statistical test at 5% significance level. RESULTS: There was statistically significant difference (p<0.05) for the reduction of bristle contamination comparing groups II, III, IV and V to group I. CONCLUSIONS: It may be stated that after toothbrushing, the Aloe vera and propolis dentifrice reduced the contamination of toothbrush bristles by SM, without differentiation from the other chemical agents used.
TI  - Inhibition of Candida albicans yeast-hyphal transition and biofilm formation by Solidago virgaurea water extracts.
AB  - Xerostomia is a decrease of saliva secretion, which can unbalance the oral microflora, mainly to the benefit of Candida albicans. The aim of the present study was to find a plant extract that could create an unfavourable environment for Candida, and would, therefore, be appropriate for use in a dry-mouth daily-care mouthwash. Water extract from the herbaceous plant Solidago virgaurea (Goldenrod) was selected due to its saponin content (plant detergents). Saponin concentrations reached 0.7 and 0.95 mg ml(-1) in S. virgaurea subsp. virgaurea and S. virgaurea subsp. alpestris extracts, respectively. C. albicans was grown in liquid medium and cells were counted by microscopic examination after 0, 4 and 24 h of incubation. Solidago extracts did not inhibit the growth of C. albicans (four strains), Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius or Enterococcus faecalis. When inocula were incubated with Solidago extract for 4 and 24 h, we observed a decrease in Candida yeast-hyphal transition. Candida biofilms were then prepared in microtitre plates and treated with plant extracts at 0 h, to estimate biofilm formation, or at 18 h to estimate the effect of the saponin on pre-formed biofilms. Biofilm formation and pre-formed biofilms were both strongly inhibited. In conclusion, the S. virgaurea extract was efficient against two key virulence factors of C. albicans: the yeast-hyphal transition phase and biofilm formation.
TI  - In Vitro Antibacterial Activity of Galls of Quercus infectoria Olivier against Oral Pathogens.
AB  - The galls of Quercus infectoria are commonly used in Malay traditional medicine to treat wound infections after childbirth. In India, they are employed traditionally as dental applications such as that in treatment of toothache and gingivitis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of galls of Quercus infectoria Olivier against oral bacteria which are known to cause dental caries and periodontitis. Methanol and acetone extracts were screened against two Gram-positive bacteria (Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175 and Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419) and two Gram-negative bacteria (Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277 and Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25586). The screening test of antibacterial activity was performed using agar-well diffusion method. Subsequently, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by using twofold serial microdilution method at a concentration ranging between 0.01 mg/mL and 5 mg/mL. Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was obtained by subculturing microtiter wells which showed no changes in colour of the indicator after incubation. Both extracts showed inhibition zones which did not differ significantly (P < 0.05) against each tested bacteria. Among all tested bacteria, S. salivarius was the most susceptible. The MIC ranges for methanol and acetone extracts were the same, between 0.16 and 0.63 mg/mL. The MBC value, for methanol and acetone extracts, was in the ranges 0.31-1.25 mg/mL and 0.31-2.50 mg/mL, respectively. Both extracts of Q. infectoria galls exhibited similar antibacterial activity against oral pathogens. Thus, the galls may be considered as effective phytotherapeutic agents for the prevention of oral pathogens.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of silver diamine fluoride in different concentrations.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of Silver Diamine Fluoride - SDF -(Cariestop), at commercial concentrations of 12% and 30%, was evaluated against clinical and pattern strains (ATCC 25175) of S. mutans. Clinical isolates were obtained from the saliva of six children attending the Pediatric Dentistry Clinic UFPB, being grouped as follows: GI- low risk and caries activity, GII- high risk and caries activity. Once sown, the strains were isolated from Mitis-Salivarius Agar and divided into seven groups - M1 (pattern strain) to M7. The antibacterial activity was determined by maximum inhibitory dilution (MID) by the agar diffusion method, using serial dilutions (1:1 to 1:32) and the pure formulations of SDF and chlorhexidine 0.12% (positive control). After incubation, the inhibition zones were measured. The bactericidal and bacteriostatic actions of pure substances and in their respective MIDs were evaluated by test of germicidal power using glass specimens, after inoculation by the strains and incubation for 24 hours in BHI broth. Each specimen was exposed to chlorhexidine and to SDF for 30s, 3min, 30min and 1h, then incubated for 24 h in BHI broth. The samples were subcultured in Mitis-Salivarius Agar to evaluate the bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity of the substances. The data were analyzed in a comparative-descriptive method. The Cariestop 30% was effective until the last dilution (1:32) on all strains. For Cariestop 12%, the MIDs corresponded to last dilution (1:32) in almost all samples, except for M3 (1:8). Chlorhexidine showed DIM in the last concentrations (1:32) on five samples, and in the concentration 1:8 for M3 and M7. As evidence of the germicidal power the substances had bactericidal activity at all times analyzed. It was concluded that the cariostatic showed antibacterial activity when compared to chlorhexidine and these two substances presented bactericidal action against the strains at all contact times.
TI  - Efficacy of xylitol and fluoride mouthrinses on salivary Mutans streptococci.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the level of salivary Mutans streptococci (MS) after rinsing with xylitol, fluoride, and a combination of xylitol and fluoride solutions, compared with distilled water. METHODS: Eighty healthy 8-9 years old subjects with high level of MS (> 10(5) CFU/mL) were equally divided into 4 groups. Subjects rinsed their mouths for 1 min with 10 mL of 0.05% (w/v) sodium fluoride (NaF), 12.5% (w/v) xylitol or 0.05% (w/v) NaF + 12.5% (w/v) xylitol 3 times daily over 10 weeks. Distilled water rinsed group served as a control. Paraffin-stimulated whole saliva samples were collected at baseline, 5 weeks, and 10 weeks after rinsing to determine the level of salivary MS by culturing on Mitis Salivarius Bacitracin agar. The statistical significance was calculated by Kruskal Wallis, Mann Whitney U, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests at a significant level of P< 0.05. RESULTS: Significant reductions in MS count were observed in subjects using 0.05% NaF + 12.5% xylitol over other groups within 5 weeks and after 10 weeks and 12.5% xylitol alone after 10 weeks compared with baseline. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides evidence for the inhibitory effect of xylitol, used in combination with fluoride, delivered in the form of mouthrinse, on salivary MS in the group of schoolchildren.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antibiofilm action of Casbane Diterpene from Croton nepetaefolius against oral bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The antibacterial activity of Casbane Diterpene (CD) was evaluated in  vitro against Streptococcus oralis, S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. sobrinus, S. mitis and S. sanguinis. The viability of planktonic cells was analysed by susceptibility tests (MIC and MBC) and antibiofilm action was assayed. METHODS: The minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations (MIC and MBC) of oral Streptococcus were evaluated through microdilution tests. To assay antibiofilm activity, biofilms were generated on 96-wells polystyrene plates under the presence of CD and quantified by a crystal violet technique and colonies forming units counting. RESULTS: The CD isolated from Croton nepetaefolius showed antimicrobial effect on planktonic forms and biofilms of oral pathogens, with MIC values of 62.5 mug/mL against Streptococcus oralis and values between 125 and 500 mug/mL against S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. sobrinus, S. mitis and S. sanguinis. CD showed an inhibitory effect on S. mutans biofilm formation at 250 mug/mL, and a decrease on viable cell of 94.28% compared to the normal biofilm growth. CONCLUSIONS: The compound CD can be considered as a promising molecule for the treatment against oral pathogens responsible for dental biofilm.
TI  - Streptococci-human papilloma virus interaction with ethanol exposure leads to keratinocyte damage.
AB  - PURPOSE: Ethanol, human papilloma virus (HPV), and poor oral hygiene are risk factors that have been attributed to oral carcinogenesis. Streptococci sp and HPV infections are common in the head and neck, often associated with sexual activity. Although HPV is linked to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, it is unclear whether there is a similar role for Streptococci sp. This cell study examines whether Streptococci sp and HPV-16 with exposure to ethyl alcohol (ETOH) can act as cofactors in the malignant transformation of oral keratinocytes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ETOH (0.1%-20% vol/vol) was used to investigate Streptococci sp attachment with immortalized E6-expressing HPV/HOK-16B cells, human oral buccal keratinocytes, and foreskin keratinocytes. Streptococci sp (Streptococci mutans [LT11]) and various strains of acetaldehyde (AA) producer and nonproducer Streptococcus salivarius (110-1, 109-2, 101-7, and 107-1) and a lactic acid producer bacterium, Lactobacillus rhamnosus (24-1 and 25-2), were examined for interactions with keratinocytes by use of a green dye (percent of cells with colonies after 24 hours). Carcinogens, AA, malondialdehyde, DNA damage, and proliferation (5'-bromo-2-deoxyuridine) among keratinocytes were also quantified. RESULTS: AA and malondialdehyde production from permissible Streptococci sp significantly increased with attachment to keratinocytes, whereas L rhamnosus did not significantly attach to keratinocytes. This attachment was associated with enhanced levels of AA adduct formation, proliferation (5'-bromo-2-deoxyuridine incorporation), and enhanced migration through integrin-coated basement membrane by HPV oral keratinocytes, which are characteristics of a malignant phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: These cell studies suggest that oral Streptococci sp and HPV (HPV-16) cooperate to transform oral keratinocytes after low-level ETOH (1%) exposure. These results appear to suggest a significant clinical interaction, but further validation is warranted.
TI  - Anticariogenic potentials of clove, tobacco and bitter kola.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate three tropical plant materials - clove seeds [Syzygium  aromaticum (S. aromaticum)], bitter kola fruits [Garcinia kola (G. kola)] and tobacco leaves (Nicotiana species) as potential targeted killers of Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), a cavity-causing bacterium (gram-positive, facultative anaerobe) that resides in a multispecies microbial community (dental plaque) for the treatment of dental caries (tooth decay). METHODS: Thirty one (31) teeth samples were collected from patients with obvious signs of tooth decay (swollen gum, weak or fallen tooth, etc.) using sterile swab sticks. These samples were collected from two major dental clinics in Nsukka, Enugu State, Nigeria and investigated by spread inoculation onto sterile blood agar and Mueller Hinton agar (MHA) respectively and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The discrete colonies obtained were further re-inoculated onto sterile Mitis salivarius agar (MSA) plates and incubated as above. The isolates were characterized by gram staining and catalase test. Tobacco leaves, clove seeds and bitter kola fruits were ground into powder, extracted with three different solvents (n-hexane, hot water and ethanol), filtered, dried and stored in clean containers, corked and kept until used. The plant extracts were investigated for phytochemistry, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum cidal concentration (MCC) and compared with some conventional antibiotics commonly used against tooth decay. Antibiotic sensitivity test was also carried out. The results were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The extracts showed varied phytochemical composition but most abundantly the flavonoids. Our result also shows that females (16) have more tooth decay than males (15) and that 16 samples were very bloody while 15 were slightly bloody. The microbial characterization showed that 18 samples were catalase-positive indicating the presence of S. mutans while 13 were catalase-negative suspected to be Staphylococcus spp. The Gram reaction confirmed 13 Gram-negative and 18 Gram-positive organisms. The n-hexane extract had the best antimicrobial activity followed by the ethanol and lastly hot water. MIC showed that n-hexane clove extract had the largest inhibition zone diameter, followed by bitter kola extract and lastly tobacco extract. The antibiotic sensitivity test credited ciprofloxacin the best because it exhibited broad spectrum of action. CONCLUSIONS: Since the n-hexane extract of clove seeds demonstrated preferential growth-inhibitory activity against the causal cariogenic pathogens (S. mutans) in dental caries, we therefore, report here that clove extract be henceforth considered as a potential ingredient in toothpaste preparation.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities of punica granatum peel extracts against  oral pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Punica granatum has been used for many years in folk medicine due to several purposes. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of methanolic extract of Punica granatum peel (MEPGP) against Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguinis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Actynomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Candida albicans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this in vitro study, the mentioned oral organisms were cultured in blood agar and mueller-hinton media and then paper disks containing MEPGP at concentrations of 4 mg/ml, 8 mg/ml and 12 mg/ml were inserted on medias. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by agar disk diffusion method. The effects of three different concentrations of MEPGP against microorganisms were compared using one-way ANOVA and Tukey tests. RESULTS: All concentrations of MEPGP had antibacterial activity against S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Only at concentration of 8 mg/ml and 12 mg/ml MEPGP was effective against L. acidophilus, S. mutans and S. salivarius. Furthermore; no concentrations of MEPGP inhibited A. viscosus and C. albicans. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that MEPGP might be used as an antibacterial agent in controlling oral infections.
TI  - Rapid detection and identification of Streptococcus ratti by a species-specific PCR method.
AB  - To establish a rapid and species-specific detection and identification method of  Streptococcus ratti by polymerase chain reaction, two PCR primer pairs specific to S. ratti were designed on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of the dextranase gene (dex) of S. ratti ATCC19645(T). The primer pairs specifically detected S. ratti, but none of the other mutans streptococci (16 strains of 6 species). The PCR procedure was capable of detecting 1 pg of genomic DNA purified from S. ratti ATCC19645. We developed the Streptococcus mutans-, Streptococcus sobrinus-, Streptococcus downei- and Streptococcus salivarius-specific PCR methods (the dex PCR methods) with the primer pairs specific for a portion of the dex gene of each species. The mixture of these primer pairs including S. ratti (this study) successfully differentiated the five species of mutans streptococci by species-specific amplicons of different lengths. These results suggest that the present PCR method is suitable for the specific detection and identification of S. ratti, and that the mixture of primer pairs for the dex PCR methods is useful for species-specific detection and rapid discrimination of each species in mutans streptococci.
TI  - Establishment of Streptococcus mutans in infants induces decrease in the proportion of salivary alpha-haemolytic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: For paediatric dentists, an indicator to assess caries risk of infants is very important. Conventionally, the number and/or proportions of Streptococcus mutans have been employed as risk indicator; however, because such figures reflect the existing situation, they are not suitable for assessing caries risk of infants that have not yet been infected with S. mutans. Thus, we searched for an indicator for the establishment of S. mutans. METHODS: To evaluate the changes caused by the establishment of S. mutans in the microbiota of the infant oral cavity, we monitored changes in the oral microbiota of two pre-dentate infants over a 3-year period and in a cross-sectional study of 40 nursery school-aged children by cultivation of saliva on nonselective blood agar, Mitis-Salivarius agar, and Mitis-Salivarius agar supplemented with bacitracin combined with identification of selected isolates. RESULTS: Two longitudinal observations suggested that the establishment of S. mutans would induce a decrease in alpha-haemolytic bacteria in the microbial population of the oral cavity. This suggestion was compensated with the results of cross-sectional study, and it was revealed that the establishment of 10(3) CFU/mL of mutans streptococci in saliva might be predicted by a microbiota comprising less than approximately 55% of alpha-haemolytic. CONCLUSION: Decrease in the proportion of alpha-haemolytic bacteria in saliva of infant was found to be applicable as an indicator to predict the establishment of S. mutans and to assess dental caries risk as a background for planning of dental care and treatment in the infants before infection with S. mutans.
TI  - Clinical use of photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy for the treatment of deep carious lesions.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy (PACT) via irradiation, using a low power laser associated with a photosensitization dye, as an alternative to remove cariogenic microorganisms by drilling. Remaining dentinal samples in deep carious lesions on permanent molars (n = 26) were treated with 0.01% methylene blue dye and irradiated with a low power laser (InGaAIP - indium gallium aluminum phosphide; lambda = 660 nm; 100 mW; 320 Jcm(-2); 90 s; 9J). Samples of dentin from the pulpal wall region were collected with a micropunch before and immediately after PACT and kept in a transport medium for microbiological analysis. Samples were cultured in plates of Brucella blood agar, Mitis Salivarius Bacitracin agar and Rogosa SL agar to determine the total viable bacteria, mutans streptococci and Lactobacillus spp. counts, respectively. After incubation, colony-forming units were counted and microbial reduction was calculated for each group of bacteria. PACT led to statistically significant reductions in mutans streptococci (1.38 log), Lactobacillus spp. (0.93 log), and total viable bacteria (0.91 log). This therapy may be an appropriate approach for the treatment of deep carious lesions using minimally invasive procedures.
TI  - A comparative evaluation of probiotics on salivary mutans streptococci counts in  Indian children.
AB  - AIM: Probiotics and their effect on oral health have been a focus of numerous trials in recent times. No documented trials have been reported from developing countries such as India with its focus on probiotic use, especially in the paediatric population. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of probiotics on salivary mutans streptococci (MS) counts of children using the two commercially and widely available preparations and to explore their anti-caries potential. STUDY DESIGN: A placebo controlled study was undertaken with 3 parallel arms comprising a total of 150 healthy children (7-14 years). The subjects were randomly divided into the groups (each comprising 50 children): group A - placebo powder, Group B - a freeze dried powdered combination of Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium species, Group C - a freeze dried powdered preparation of Bacillus coagulans. The subjects were instructed to mix the preparation in 20 ml of water and to follow a swish and swallow method for 14 days. Mutans streptococci colony counts per ml of saliva were performed on Mitis-Salivarius Bacitracin agar collected on the first day and 14 days post-intervention. RESULTS: A statistically significant reduction (p<0.001) in salivary mutans streptococci counts was recorded in both groups B and C after 14 days of probiotic ingestion. CONCLUSION: A cost-effective probiotic such as Bacillus coagulans might be a subject for further research for prevention of caries in children.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of oral Lactobacillus against oral pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the inhibitory effect of oral Lactobacillus against putative oral pathogens. METHODS AND RESULTS: Total 357 strains comprising 10 species of oral Lactobacillus, Lactobacillus fermentum (195), Lactobacillus salivarius (53), Lactobacillus casei (20), Lactobacillus gasseri (18), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (14), Lactobacillus paracasei (12), Lactobacillus mucosae (12), Lactobacillus oris (12), Lactobacillus plantarum (11) and Lactobacillus vaginalis (10) were used as producer strains. Inhibitory effect against a panel of indicators, periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens, was assessed. Most oral Lactobacillus was able to inhibit the growth of both periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens. The strongest inhibitory activity was associated with Lact. paracasei, Lact. plantarum, Lact. rhamnosus, Lact. casei and Lact. salivarius. Lactobacillus SD1-SD6, representing the six species with the strong inhibitory effect, inhibited growth of Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175 in the biofilm model. Also, it was demonstrated that growth of Strep. mutans was inhibited in a mixture with Lact. paracasei SD1. The inhibition was enhanced in acidic condition and 5% glucose. CONCLUSIONS: The results have shown that oral Lactobacillus SD1-SD6 showed a strong inhibitory effect against Strep. mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus, as well as, Gram-negative periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results indicated that Lactobacillus may be of benefit as probiotics for the prevention of oral diseases.
TI  - [The antagonistic effect of the oral Streptococcus on the Saccharomyces albicans  in vitro].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antagonistic effects of three species of oral Streptococcus on the growth of oral Saccharomyces albicans in vitro. METHODS: Direct inoculation method, reverse inoculation method and mixed culture methods were respectively chosen to observe the changes of Saccharomyces albicans colony formation on the effects of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus salivarius. RESULTS: 1) No clear inhibition zone was observed in each of the groups by direct inoculation method. 2) Compared with the control groups, Saccharomyces albicans colony formation on soft agar of Streptococcus sanguis decreased significantly (P < 0.05). 3) Mixed culture method results showed that Streptococcus mutans could inhibit the growth of Saccharomyces albicans significantly at different time points (P = 0.001). 4) Under the action of bacteria culture supernatant, the count of Saccharomyces albicans in experiment groups showed statistical significance when compared with the control groups at 24, 48, 72 h (P = 0.001); The differences among the experimental groups were of no statistical significance at majority times (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus salivarius could obviously inhibit the growth of Saccharomyces albicans in vitro. However, it is still unclear that among which the inhibition effects is stronger. The antagonistic effects is weakened gradually.
TI  - Oral microflora in infants delivered vaginally and by caesarean section.
AB  - BACKGROUND. Early in life, vaginally delivered infants exhibit a different composition of the gut flora compared with infants delivered by caesarean section (C-section); however, it is unclear whether this also applies to the oral cavity. AIM. To investigate and compare the oral microbial profile between infants delivered vaginally and by C-section. DESIGN. This is a cross-sectional case-control study. Eighty-four infants delivered either vaginally (n = 42) or by C-section (n = 42) were randomly selected from the 2009 birth cohort at the County Hospital in Halmstad, Sweden. Medically compromised and premature children (<32 weeks) were excluded. The mean age was 8.25 months (range 6-10 months), and parents were asked to complete a questionnaire on socioeconomic factors, lifestyle, and hygiene habits. Saliva was collected and analysed using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS. A higher prevalence of salivary Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus curvata, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Lactobacuillus casei was detected in infants delivered vaginally (P < 0.05). The caries-associated bacteria Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus were detected in 63% and 59% of all children, respectively. CONCLUSION. A significantly higher prevalence of certain strains of health-related streptococci and lactobacilli was found in vaginally delivered infants compared with infants delivered by C-section. The possible long-term effects on oral health need to be further investigated.
TI  - [Can dental problems have influence on difficulties in treating paranasal sinusitis in children?].
AB  - Paranasal sinusitis is a condition that is treated by a General Practitioner and  in case it fails it requires specialistic therapy. In most cases the inflammation is connected with nasal mucosa infection. However, in older children and adolescents sinusitis caused by spreading of tooth and gingiva inflammatory process can be an essential therapeutic and diagnostic problem. It is most often connected with periapical lesions, complications following dental procedures and oroantral fistula inflammation. Inflammatory process originally concerns maxillary sinus, however, it often undergoes generalization and it affects all or most of sinuses unilaterally or bilaterally. In microbiology of odontogenic sinusitis the dominant bacteria are the bacteria typical for peridental lesions (Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mutans and anaerobic bacteria). Odontogenic sinusitis frequently causes life threatening complications that require heroic drug and surgical treatment. Therapeutic and diagnostic problems are presented in case studies of 5 children aged from 10 to 17, who are treated in Children's Otolaryngology, Audiology and Phoniatrics Clinic in Lodz. There seems to be the need to emphasize the importance of thorough examination of oral cavity in all the children suffering from sinusitis, especially unilateral sinusitis. It is so essential on account of the gravity of the problem and serious complications that accompany the conditions.
TI  - Dental caries experience in relation to salivary findings and molecular identification of S. mutans and S. sobrinus in subjects with Down syndrome.
AB  - This study investigated the association between clinical and salivary or molecular parameters in Down syndrome subjects. Sixty individuals (1- to 48-year old) were clinically examined using DMFT/DMFS. Stimulated saliva was collected; salivary flow was calculated (mL/min), buffering capacity was measured using a standard pH tape. In addition, 25 muL of saliva was diluted using 10-fold-dilution method and then placed on Mitis-Salivarius-Bacitracin agar to count colony forming units (CFU/mL) of mutans streptococci. Polymerase chain reaction analysis identified species. Caries indexes were 0.65-13.5 (DMFT) and 0.65-26.0 (DMFS) according to groups. Ninety-four percent of subjects had low flow rate (0.7-1.0 mL/min) and 44% had low buffering capacity (pH < 4). Besides, 60% had more than 1 x 10(6) CFU/mL, 60% had S. mutans, and 41.4% had S. sobrinus. Caries indexes did not significantly correlate with flow rate, buffering capacity, CFU/mL by Pearson's correlation (p > 0.05), and showed no significant association with prevalence of species by Chi-square (p > 0.05). There is no association between clinical picture and salivary or molecular parameters in Down syndrome subjects.
TI  - Evaluating the In-vitro Antibacterial Effect of Iranian Propolis on Oral Microorganisms.
AB  - Propolis has traditionally been used in curing infections and healing wounds and  burns. Current researches have shown that propolis has antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral actions however, the pharmacological activity of propolis is highly variable depending on its geographic origin. There have been few studies on the effects of Iranian propolis on the oral microorganisms. In this in-vitro study, the antimicrobial activity of the ethanolic and water extracts of the Iranian propolis (10%, w/v) from north-east area of Tehran was evaluated. Susceptibility of the oral strains tested (Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35668; Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 9222; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 9854 and Lactobacillus casei ATCC 39392) was evaluated using the agar diffusion method at a concentration of 20 mg/mL of propolis and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. Antibacterial activity was determined by using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) at different concentrations of propolis. The ethanolic extract showed bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against all the strains, with MIC and MBC ranges of 250-500 microg/mL. The MIC concentration of the water extract was 500 microg/mL against S. mutans and E. faecalis. The water extract showed bactericidal activity only against S. mutans (20 mg/mL). These results indicate that the ethanolic extract is probably more useful in the control of oral biofilms and subsequent dental caries development. However, to determine the consequence of the ethanolic extract of Iranian propolis on the oral mucosa, in-vivo studies of its possible effects are needed.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of 15-deoxygoyazensolide isolated from the stems of Minasia alpestris (Asteraceae) against oral pathogens.
AB  - This work reports the isolation of the sesquiterpene lactone 15-deoxygoyazensolide from the stems of Minasia alpestris and the evaluation of its antimicrobial activity against the following oral pathogens: Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Lactobacillus casei. Despite the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of other sesquiterpene lactones of the furanoheliangolide-type, our results revealed that this compound exhibits low antibacterial activity against the evaluated oral pathogens; however, an interesting selectivity against E. faecalis (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC]=40 microg mL(-1)) and S. sobrinus (MIC=60 microg mL(-1)) was observed.
TI  - The effect of xylitol on the composition of the oral flora: a pilot study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the microbial composition of plaque and saliva. METHODS: Twelve volunteers (22-38 yrs) harboring mutans streptococci (MS) participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. The experimental chewing gum contained 65% xylitol while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol and 2% maltitol w/w. The polyol dose was approximately 6 g/day. Stimulated saliva and plaque samples were collected before and after the two four-week test periods. The samples were cultured for MS, total streptococci, lactobacilli, and total facultatives. A part of the samples were subjected to DNA-DNA hybridizations of 14 microbial plaque species: Actinomyces naeslundii, A. viscosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. fermentum, L. paracasei, L. rhamnose, L. plantarum, Streptococcus gordonii, S. oralis, S. parasanguis, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis, Veillonella parvula. RESULTS: The MS counts of the plaque samples collected from "caries-prone" tooth sites decreased significantly (P<.01) in the xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. Also the plaque MS percentage decreased significantly in the xylitol gum group (P<.01). The salivary MS counts did not decrease either in the xylitol or in the sorbitol gum groups. Nor were changes detected in the salivary levels of total streptococci or lactobacilli. The DNA-DNA hybridization assay revealed no study-induced changes in the microbial composition of the dental plaque. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this pilot study, xylitol consumption reduced MS counts in plaque but appeared not to affect the microbial composition of plaque or saliva in general.
TI  - Influence of Salvadora persica (miswak) extract on physical and antimicrobial properties of glass ionomer cement.
AB  - AIM: To investigate physical and antimicrobial properties of Glass Ionomer Cement (GIC) combined with Salvadora Persica Extract (SPE). METHODS: SPE was added to GIC (Fuji IX) in concentrations of 1%, 2% and 4% w/w. The compressive strength and diametral tensile strength were measured at 1 h, 24 h and 7 days. The antimicrobial effect was tested in agar dilution assay in blood agar plates with Candida albicans, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus salivarius and Actinomyces naeslundii as test organisms. GIC containing 5% chlorhexidine served as positive control. RESULTS: Significant differences were found for the compressive strength and diametral tensile strength as a result of adding SPE to GIC (p<0.05). GIC with 2 or 4 % SPE was significantly weaker than the GIC control, while GIC with 1% SPE was not different from the control. The mean values for the 4% SPE-containing specimens and the GIC control group ranged from 108.7MPa to 141.1MPa for CS and from 8.2MPa to 12.5MPa for DTS. The 1% SPE-containing specimens were not different in physical properties compared to the control GIC specimens; the 2% SPE-containing specimens were statistically slightly less strong (p<0.05), but within an acceptable range. As compared with pure GIC the antimicrobial properties of the SPE-containing specimens were increased significantly (p<0.01). It has been found up to a 2-fold increased inhibition compared to the GIC with increasing concentrations of SPE. For most microorganisms tested the SPE group inhibited less than Chlorhexidine, but significantly better than pure GIC (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: SPE could be a promising natural material as an additive to GICs. Further studies should include in vivo tests and other antimicrobial and physical properties of this combination.
TI  - Inhibition of Streptococcus mutans biofilm formation by Streptococcus salivarius  FruA.
AB  - The oral microbial flora consists of many beneficial species of bacteria that are associated with a healthy condition and control the progression of oral disease. Cooperative interactions between oral streptococci and the pathogens play important roles in the development of dental biofilms in the oral cavity. To determine the roles of oral streptococci in multispecies biofilm development and the effects of the streptococci in biofilm formation, the active substances inhibiting Streptococcus mutans biofilm formation were purified from Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 9759 and HT9R culture supernatants using ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry analysis was performed, and the results were compared to databases. The S. salivarius HT9R genome sequence was determined and used to indentify candidate proteins for inhibition. The candidates inhibiting biofilms were identified as S. salivarius fructosyltransferase (FTF) and exo-beta-d-fructosidase (FruA). The activity of the inhibitors was elevated in the presence of sucrose, and the inhibitory effects were dependent on the sucrose concentration in the biofilm formation assay medium. Purified and commercial FruA from Aspergillus niger (31.6% identity and 59.6% similarity to the amino acid sequence of FruA from S. salivarius HT9R) completely inhibited S. mutans GS-5 biofilm formation on saliva-coated polystyrene and hydroxyapatite surfaces. Inhibition was induced by decreasing polysaccharide production, which is dependent on sucrose digestion rather than fructan digestion. The data indicate that S. salivarius produces large quantities of FruA and that FruA alone may play an important role in multispecies microbial interactions for sucrose-dependent biofilm formation in the oral cavity.
TI  - Invasion of human aortic endothelial cells by oral viridans group streptococci and induction of inflammatory cytokine production.
AB  - Oral viridans group streptococci are the major commensal bacteria of the supragingival oral biofilm and have been detected in human atheromatous plaque. Atherosclerosis involves an ongoing inflammatory response, reportedly involving chronic infection caused by multiple pathogens. The aim of this study was to examine the invasion of human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) by oral viridans group streptococci and the subsequent cytokine production by viable invaded HAECs. The invasion of HAECs by bacteria was examined using antibiotic protection assays and was visualized by confocal scanning laser microscopy. The inhibitory effects of catalase and cytochalasin D on the invasion of HAECs were also examined. The production of cytokines by invaded or infected HAECs was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and a real-time polymerase chain reaction method was used to evaluate the expression of cytokine messenger RNA. The oral streptococci tested were capable of invading HAECs. The number of invasive bacteria increased with the length of the co-culture period. After a certain co-culture period, some organisms were cytotoxic to the HAECs. Catalase and cytochalasin D inhibited the invasion of HAECs by the organism. HAECs invaded by Streptococcus mutans Xc, Streptococcus gordonii DL1 (Challis), Streptococcus gordonii ATCC 10558 and Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419 produced more cytokine(s) (interleukin-6, interleukin-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) than non-invaded HAECs. The HAECs invaded by S. mutans Xc produced the largest amounts of cytokines, and the messenger RNA expression of cytokines by invaded HAECs increased markedly compared with that by non-invaded HAECs. These results suggest that oral streptococci may participate in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.
TI  - Molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE gene loci in viridans group streptococci isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. However, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (CF) airways has not yet been examined. The aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (VGS), in terms of MICs and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs). METHODS: The MICs of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the QRDRs for 190 isolates of VGS, originating from the sputa of adult CF patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. VGS organisms included Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus infantis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus australis and Streptococcus mutans. Ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and QRDRs within the gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (MICs >/=8 mg/L) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (MICs 4 mg/L). As a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive VGS organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-CF patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. Five novel QRDR PCR assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the CF VGS population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential QRDR resistance mutations. Double mutations in gyrA and parC/parE led to MICs of 16 to >64 mg/L, while single mutations in parC or parE resulted in MICs of 8-32 mg/L and 8 mg/L, respectively. The mean homologies of each species to Streptococcus pneumoniae R6 were: gyrA, 70.3%-95%; gyrB, 69.6%-96.2%; parC, 76.1%-94.8%; and parE, 70.7%-94.7%. The close relatives of S. pneumoniae, S. mitis and S. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of P. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with CF may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal VGS flora, where these organisms may potentially act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the Streptococcus milleri group.
TI  - Population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (VGS) including Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).
AB  - A study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (VGS) in the sputum of adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Freshly expectorated sputa (n=58) from 45 adult CF patients were examined by selective conventional culture on Mitis-Salivarius agar and yielded 190 isolates of VGS. Sequence analyses of the rpnB and 16-23S rRNA ITS genes identified these isolates to belong to 12 species of VGS and included S. anginosus, S. australis, S. cristatus, S. gordonii, S. infantis, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis, S. pneumoniae, S. salivarius and S. sanguinis. The most frequently VGS organism isolated was S. salivarius (47/190; 24.7%), followed by S. mitis (36/190; 19%), S. sanguinis (25/190; 13.2%), S. oralis (20/190; 11.0%), S. pneumoniae (19/190; 10.0%), S. parasanguinis (16/190; 8.4%), S. infantis (11/190; 5.8%), S. gordonii (7/190; 3.7%), S. anginosus (4/190; 2.1%), S. cristatus (2/190; 1.1%), S. australis (1/190; 0.5%), S. mutans (1/190; 0.5%) and S. agalactiae (1/190; 0.5%). All, but four, patients harboured at least one VGS species, which ranged from one to five streptococcal species, with a mean of 2.85 species per patient. There was no clonality at the subspecies level employing ERIC RAPD PCR. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) testing against penicillin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. Overall, resistance to penicillin with all VGS was 73/190 (38.4%) and 167/190 (87.9%) for erythromycin. With regard to ciprofloxacin, 27/190 (14.2%) were fully resistant, whilst a further 21/190 (11.1%) showed intermediate resistance, which equated to approximately three quarters (74.7%) of isolates being fully sensitive to this agent. In addition, as a comparator control population, we examined antibiotic susceptibility, as above, in a non-CF population comprising 12 individuals (50 VGS isolates), who were not receiving chronic antibiotics. In comparison, 8% and 38% of VGS isolates from non-CF individuals were resistant by disk susceptibility testing to penicillin and erythromycin, respectively. None of the non-CF VGS organisms were resistant to ciprofloxacin, but 42% showed intermediate resistance.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the essential oil from Rosmarinus officinalis and its major components against oral pathogens.
AB  - The essential oil of Rosmarinus officinalis L. (rosemary) was obtained by hydro-distillation and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Sixty-two constituents were identified, representing 98.06% of the total oil content. Oxygenated monoterpenes were the predominant components. The rosemary oil was characterized as having prominent (> 5%) contents of camphor (18.9%), verbenone (11.3%), a-pinene (9.6%), beta-myrcene (8.6%), 1,8-cineole (8.0%), and beta-caryophyllene (5.1%). The antimicrobial activity of the oil as well as of its major constituents was tested against the following microorganisms: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sobrinus, and Enterococcus faecalis, which are potentially responsible for the formation of dental caries in humans. The microdilution method was used for determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) during evaluation of the antibacterial activity. The essential oil displayed low activity against the selected microorganisms. In the present study, the pure major compounds were more active than the essential oil. Among all the microorganisms tested, the pathogen S. mitis was the most susceptible and E. faecalis was the most resistant to the evaluated samples. This is the first report on antimicrobial activity of the major components of rosemary oil against oral pathogens.
TI  - Anticariogenic properties of ent-pimarane diterpenes obtained by microbial transformation.
AB  - In the present work, the anticariogenic activities of three pimarane-type diterpenes obtained by fungal biotransformation were investigated. Among these metabolites, ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol was the most active compound, displaying very promising MIC values (ranging from 1.5 to 4.0 mug mL(-1)) against the main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: Streptococcus salivarius, S. sobrinus, S. mutans, S. mitis, S. sanguinis, and Lactobacillus casei. Time kill assays performed with ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol against the primary causative agent S. mutans revealed that this compound only avoids growth of the inoculum in the first 12 h (bacteriostatic effect). However, its bactericidal effect is clearly noted thereafter (between 12 and 24 h). The curve profile obtained by combining ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol and chlorhexidine revealed a significant reduction in the time necessary for killing S. mutans compared with each of these two chemicals alone. However, no synergistic effect was observed using the same combination in the checkerboard assays against this microorganism. In conclusion, our results point out that ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol is an important metabolite in the search for new effective anticariogenic agents.
TI  - [Classical and new approaches in laboratory diagnosis of viridans streptococci].
AB  - Viridans group streptococci (VGS) are gram-positive microorganisms that can form  alpha-hemolytic colonies on sheep blood agar. They reside as normal flora in oral cavity, respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital tract and on skin. They can cause bacteremia, endocarditis, meningitis and septicemia following dental procedures. The diagnosis of VGS are difficult since the taxonomic classification and species na-mes may change due in time. Viridans group streptococci are classified into 5 groups (Sanguinis, Mitis, Mutans, Salivarius, Anginosus) according to biochemical reactions and 16S rRNA sequencing. Since Streptococcus pneumoniae is a member of the Mitis group, the other important species in this group deserves investigation. Genetic exchange between Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis and S.pneumoniae by transformation and lysis mechanisms occur continously as they share the same anatomical region. These mechanisms play role in exchanging capsular and antibiotic resistance genes between these species. The cultivation of VGS usually starts with the inoculation of various patient specimens into sheep blood agar and the detection of alpha-hemolytic colonies. Observation of gram-positive cocci microscopically, the detection of optochin-resistant and bile insoluble colonies with few exceptions are the further important steps in laboratory diagnosis. VGS are then identified at species level by using biochemical reactions, automated diagnostic systems and molecular methods. The last step in the laboratory diagnosis of VGS is antibiotic susceptibility testing which is of outmost importance as penicillin and erythromycin resistance are on rise. In this review article, classification of VGS, similarities between S.pneumoniae and Mitis group streptococci and the laboratory diagnosis of VGS have been discussed.
TI  - Setup of an in vitro test system for basic studies on biofilm behavior of mixed-species cultures with dental and periodontal pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Caries and periodontitis are important human diseases associated with formation of multi-species biofilms. The involved bacteria are intensively studied to understand the molecular basis of the interactions in such biofilms. This study established a basic in vitro single and mixed-species culture model for oral bacteria combining three complimentary methods. The setup allows a rapid screening for effects in the mutual species interaction. Furthermore, it is easy to handle, inexpensive, and reproducible. METHODS: Streptococcus mitis, S. salivarius and S. sanguinis, typical inhabitants of the healthy oral cavity, S. mutans as main carriogenic species, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, S. intermedius and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as periodontitis-associated bacteria, were investigated for their biofilm forming ability. Different liquid growth media were evaluated. Safranin-staining allowed monitoring of biofilm formation under the chosen conditions. Viable counts and microscopy permitted investigation of biofilm behavior in mixed-species and transwell setups. FINDINGS: S. mitis, F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis and P. micra failed to form biofilm structures. S. mutans, S. sanguinis, S. intermedius and S. salivarius established abundant biofilm masses in CDM/sucrose. A. actinomycetemcomitans formed patchy monolayers. For in depth analysis S. mitis, S. mutans and A. actinomycetemcomitans were chosen, because i) they are representatives of the physiological-, cariogenic and periodontitis-associated bacterial flora, respectively and ii) their difference in their biofilm forming ability. Microscopic analysis confirmed the results of safranin staining. Investigation of two species combinations of S. mitis with either S. mutans or A. actinomycetemcomitans revealed bacterial interactions influencing biofilm mass, biofilm structure and cell viability. CONCLUSIONS: This setup shows safranin staining, microscopic analysis and viable counts together are crucial for basic examination and evaluation of biofilms. Our experiment generated meaningful results, exemplified by the noted S. mitis influence, and allows a fast decision about the most important bacterial interactions which should be investigated in depth.
TI  - Streptococcus salivarius mutants defective in mannose phosphotransferase systems  show reduced sensitivity to mutacins I-T9 and R-3B.
AB  - Twenty-four mutacin-producing Streptococcus mutans strains were screened for their propensity to produce class II one-peptide bacteriocin using a deferred antagonism assay. Streptococcus salivarius and 3 mutants defective in their mannose phosphotransferase systems (mannose-PTS) were used as sensitive strains to identify which mannose-PTS could act as the docking site for class II one-peptide bacteriocin activity. We observed that only 2 strains of S. mutans, T9 and 3B, potentially produce class II one-peptide bacteriocin, namely mutacins I-T9 and R-3B, but with no preference for any mannose-PTS complex as a target.
TI  - Effects of probiotic Lactobacillus salivarius WB21 on halitosis and oral health:  an open-label pilot trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether oral administration of lactobacilli alters the degree of halitosis and clinical conditions associated with halitosis. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty patients with genuine halitosis were given 2.0 x 10(9)Lactobacillus salivarius WB21 and xylitol in tablet form daily. Oral malodor and clinical parameters were evaluated at the same time of day for each patient after 2 and 4 weeks. RESULTS: All 20 patients were positive for L. salivarius DNA in their saliva at 2 weeks, although 12 patients were negative for this organism at baseline. Oral malodor parameters significantly decreased at 2 weeks in the subjects with physiologic halitosis. The scores of an organoleptic test and bleeding on probing significantly decreased at 4 weeks in the subjects with oral pathologic halitosis. CONCLUSIONS: Oral administration of probiotic lactobacilli primarily improved physiologic halitosis and also showed beneficial effects on bleeding on probing from the periodontal pocket.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Rosmarinus officinalis against oral pathogens: relevance of carnosic acid and carnosol.
AB  - The in vitro inhibitory activity of crude EtOH/H2O extracts from the leaves and stems of Rosmarinus officinalis L. was evaluated against the following microorganisms responsible for initiating dental caries: Streptococcus mutans, S. salivarius, S. sobrinus, S. mitis, S. sanguinis, and Enterococcus faecalis. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined with the broth microdilution method. The bioassay-guided fractionation of the leaf extract, which displayed the higher antibacterial activity than the stem extract, led to the identification of carnosic acid (2) and carnosol (3) as the major compounds in the fraction displaying the highest activity, as identified by HPLC analysis. Rosmarinic acid (1), detected in another fraction, did not display any activity against the selected microorganisms. HPLC Analysis revealed the presence of low amounts of ursolic acid (4) and oleanolic acid (5) in the obtained fractions. The results suggest that the antimicrobial activity of the extract from the leaves of R. officinalis may be ascribed mainly to the action of 2 and 3.
TI  - Alkali production associated with malolactic fermentation by oral streptococci and protection against acid, oxidative, or starvation damage.
AB  - Alkali production by oral streptococci is considered important for dental plaque  ecology and caries moderation. Recently, malolactic fermentation (MLF) was identified as a major system for alkali production by oral streptococci, including Streptococcus mutans. Our major objectives in the work described in this paper were to further define the physiology and genetics of MLF of oral streptococci and its roles in protection against metabolic stress damage. L-Malic acid was rapidly fermented to L-lactic acid and CO(2) by induced cells of wild-type S. mutans, but not by deletion mutants for mleS (malolactic enzyme) or mleP (malate permease). Mutants for mleR (the contiguous regulator gene) had intermediate capacities for MLF. Loss of capacity to catalyze MLF resulted in loss of capacity for protection against lethal acidification. MLF was also found to be protective against oxidative and starvation damage. The capacity of S. mutans to produce alkali from malate was greater than its capacity to produce acid from glycolysis at low pH values of 4 or 5. MLF acted additively with the arginine deiminase system for alkali production by Streptococcus sanguinis, but not with urease of Streptococcus salivarius. Malolactic fermentation is clearly a major process for alkali generation by oral streptococci and for protection against environmental stresses.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of terpenoids from Copaifera langsdorffii Desf. against cariogenic bacteria.
AB  - In the present work, the anticariogenic activities of nine labdane type-diterpenes and four sesquiterpenes were investigated. Among these metabolites, (-)-copalic acid (CA) was the most active compound displaying MIC values very promising (ranging from 2.0 to 6.0 microg/mL) against the main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: Streptococcus salivarius, S. sobrinus, S. mutans, S. mitis, S. sanguinis and Lactobacillus casei. Time kill assays performed with CA against the primary causative agent (S. mutans) revealed that, in the first 12 h, this compound only inhibits the growth of the inoculum (bacteriostatic effect). However, its bactericidal effect is clearly noted thereafter (between 12 and 24 h). Also, CA did not show a synergistic effect when combined with the anticariogenic gold standard (chlorhexidine, CHD) in the checkerboard assays against S. mutans. In conclusion, the results points out CA as an important metabolite in the search for new effective anticariogenic agents.
TI  - A preliminary study of biological characteristics of Streptococcus oligofermentans in oral microecology.
AB  - This study was designed to explore the biological characteristics of a new oral streptococcus species Streptococcus oligofermentans. Plaque samples were collected from caries-free and caries-active subjects. S. oligofermentans was selectively grown on Mitis salivarius agar plates and identified by using 2-step PCR and was isolated from 38% of 18 subjects. Isolates were found mostly on healthy tooth surfaces. S. oligofermentans had weaker abilities in acid production and demineralizing hydroxyapatite. When Streptococcus mutans was coincubated with S. oligofermentans, total number, acid production and calcium release were significantly inhibited. In conclusion, inhibition of S. mutans could be a beneficial biological characteristic of S. oligofermentans in oral microecology.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of root canal sealers and calcium hydroxide paste.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of different root canal sealers and calcium hydroxide (CH) paste. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample was composed of two sealers (Fill Canal((R)) and Sealer 26((R))), one CH cement (Hydro C((R))), and a CH paste. The agar diffusion test was performed in Petri dishes inoculated with the following microorganisms: Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, Candida krusei, and Candida tropicalis. The diameters of the zones of microbial growth inhibition were measured after 24 h. The tests were performed in triplicate. Data were analyzed statistically by ANOVA and Tukey's test at 5% significance level. RESULTS: Fill Canal((R)) exhibited the largest mean zone of microbial growth inhibition against the Candida species and differed significantly from the other groups (P < 0.001). When inhibition was observed against S. mitis and S. oralis, the CH paste presented a larger mean zone of microbial growth inhibition than those of the other materials (P < 0.05). Regarding the inhibition of S. mutans, a statistically significant difference was observed only between the CH paste and Hydro C((R)) (P < 0.05); the paste produced the largest mean zone of microbial growth inhibition against this microorganism. Regarding the inhibition of S. salivarius, Fill Canal((R)) presented smaller mean zone of microbial growth inhibition than Sealer 26((R)) and CH paste (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: All the materials presented zones of microbial growth inhibition against all the test bacteria. Fill Canal((R)) presented the largest mean zone of inhibition against the Candida species. For the Streptococcus cultures, none of the sealers presented inhibition superior to that of the CH paste.
TI  - Detection of oral streptococci with collagen-binding properties in saliva specimens from mothers and their children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 10-20% of Streptococcus mutans strains have been reported to possess collagen-binding properties, whereas other species in the oral cavity with those properties remain to be elucidated. Aim. To identify strains with collagen-binding properties and analyse their characteristics in comparison with S. mutans. DESIGN: A total of 110 expectorated saliva specimens were collected from 55 pairs of mothers and their children. Bacterial strains with collagen-binding properties were isolated and the species specified. In addition, strains with collagen-binding properties isolated from mother-child pairs were analysed using molecular biological approaches. RESULTS: The detection frequency of strains with collagen-binding properties was shown to be 40.9%, among which S. salivarius was the most frequently detected, followed by S. mutans. The collagen-binding activity of the S. mutans group was the highest, followed by S. salivarius. In addition, S. mutans and S. salivarius strains from 3 and 1 mother-child pairs, respectively, were shown to be the same clones. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that S. mutans and S. salivarius are major species with collagen-binding properties in the oral cavity, and that strains with such properties may be related to mother-child transmission.
TI  - Potent anticariogenic activity of Aceriphyllum rossii and its components, aceriphyllic acid A and 3-oxoolean-12-en-27-oic acid.
AB  - Aceriphyllum rossii Engler (Saxifragaceae) have been used as a nutritious food in Korea. We found that the methanol extract of A. rossii root and its components, aceriphyllic acid A and 3-oxoolean-12-en-27-oic acid, potently inhibited the growth of the key cariogenic bacteria, Streptococcus mutans, with MIC of 2 to 4 microg/mL. They also showed antibacterial activity against other cariogenic bacteria such as S. oralis, S. sobrinus, and S. salivarius with the similar potency. In the time-kill study, aceriphyllic acid A reduced the viable counts of S. mutans by 90% in 1 min at 8 microg/mL, indicating that aceriphyllic acid A had the fast bacteriostatic activity. Severe damages of the cell surface of S. mutans by aceriphyllic acid A were observed by transmission electron microscopy, suggesting with its fast antibacterial activity that its mechanism of action might be membrane disruption. These results suggest that the methanol extract of A. rossii root and its components, aceriphyllic acid A and 3-oxoolean-12-en-27-oic acid, could have the great potential as natural agents for preventing dental caries.
TI  - Degree of conversion and antimicrobial activity of etch-and-rinse versus self-etching adhesives.
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was designed to compare the self-etching with the etch-and-rinse adhesives regarding the degree of conversion and antimicrobial activity against cariogenic bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The materials used were AdheSE (two-step self-etching), Adper Prompt L-Pop (self-etching, single-step) and Excite (etch-and-rinse) adhesives. The degree of conversion was measured using Fourier Transformation Infrared Spectroscopy. The absorbance peaks of infrared rays by the aliphatic C=C was detected at 1632 to 1637cm-1 and the aromatic C=C peak at 1610 to 1500 cm-1.The antimicrobial activity was evaluated using the microorganisms Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Actinomyces odontolyticus, with a disk diffusion method. Chlorhexidine digluconate solution 0.2% was used as a positive control. Zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed and measured. RESULTS: AdheSE showed the highest degree of conversion, followed by Excite, while Adper Prompt L-Pop had the lowest values. A significant difference in the degree of conversion was found between Excite and Adper Prompt L-Pop as well as AdheSE and Adper Prompt L-Pop. On the other hand, there was no significant difference between Excite and AdheSE. Adper Prompt L-Pop showed an antimicrobial effect against Streptococcus mutans and Actinomyces odontolyticus while it was unable to inhibit the growth of Lactobacillus salivarius. AdheSE could inhibit the growth of Streptococcus mutans only. Excite did not produce inhibition zones to the tested microorganisms. CONCLUSION: Adper Prompt L-Pop showed the worst degree of conversion. AdheSE and Excite had the highest degree of conversion. Appreciable antimicrobial activity was noted with self-etching adhesives, while the etch-and-rinse demonstrated no antimicrobial action.
TI  - Adherence of Streptococcus mutans to Fiber-Reinforced Filling Composite and Conventional Restorative Materials.
AB  - OBJECTIVES.: The aim was to investigate the adhesion of Streptococcus mutans (S.  mutans) to a short glass fibers reinforced semi-IPN polymer matrix composite resin. The effect of surface roughness on adhesion was also studied. For comparison, different commercial restorative materials were also evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS.: Experimental composite FC resin was prepared by mixing 22.5 wt% of short E-glass fibers, 22.5 wt% of IPN-resin and 55 wt% of silane treated silica fillers using high speed mixing machine. Three direct composite resins (Z250, Grandio and Nulite), resin-modified glass ionomers (Fuji II LC), amalgam (ANA 2000), fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) (everStick and Ribbond), and pre-fabricated ceramic filling insert (Cerana class 1) were tested in this study. Enamel and dentin were used as controls. The specimens (n=3/group) with or without saliva were incubated in a suspension of S. mutans allowing initial adhesion to occur. For the enumeration of cells on the disc surfaces as colony forming units (CFU) the vials with the microbe samples were thoroughly Vortex-treated and after serial dilutions grown anaerobically for 2 days at +37 degrees C on Mitis salivarius agars (Difco) containing bacitracin. Bacterial adhesion was also evaluated by using scanning electron microscopy. Surface roughness (Ra) of the materials was also determined using a surface profilometer. All results were statistically analyzed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS.: Composite FC resin and other commercial restorative materials showed similar adhesion of S. mutans, while adhesion to dentin and enamel was significantly higher (p<0.05). Surface roughness had no effect on bacterial adhesion. Saliva coating significantly decreased the adhesion for all materials (p<0.05). Composite FC resin had a significantly higher Ra value than control groups (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS.: Short fiber-reinforced composite with semi-IPN polymer matrix revealed similar S. mutans adhesion than commercial restorative materials.
TI  - Effect of a single-use toothbrush on plaque microflora.
AB  - AIM: To study and compare the microbial flora of dental plaque after the use of a self-contaminated toothbrush and that of a single-use toothbrush. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group included 40 young volunteers from Yenepoya Dental College, who were free from any systemic or oral disease. In these subjects, plaque samples were collected after 1 month use of a self-contaminated toothbrush. Each subject was given a set of 30 new toothbrushes and a toothpaste tube and instructed to use one toothbrush everyday and discard it after use. The plaque samples were collected on a weekly interval and cultured on Mitis Salivarius agar. The colonies were identified and speciated and their count was recorded. RESULTS: Streptococcus mitis, S. mutans, S. sanguis, S. milleri and Candida were recovered from the samples. A highly significant decrease in their numbers was found after the use of a single-use toothbrush (P value 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: As a contaminated toothbrush can reintroduce microorganisms into the oral cavity, it may be a sound practice to change the toothbrush as frequently as possible.
TI  - DIAGNOdent measurements of cultures of selected oral bacteria and demineralized enamel.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Carious tissue fluoresces with a wavelength different from sound tissue when stimulated by light with a wavelength of 655 nm. This difference is thought to have a bacterial origin rather than indicating demineralization. This study aimed to measure fluorescence emitted by normal cultivable caries-associated bacterial flora and typical porphyrin-producing bacteria with DIAGNOdent, and to verify earlier findings that demineralization of the dental hard tissue does not affect DIAGNOdent readings. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bacterial samples were collected from five occlusal caries lesions in three subjects. From these, mixed anaerobic flora, Lactobacilli and mutans Streptococci were cultured in up to three different kinds of culture medium. Colonies of Lactobacilli and mutans Streptococci were also measured after transferring them to glass slides. Laboratory teaching strains of Prevotella spp., Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinomyces odontolyticus were cultured anaerobically and fluorescence measured directly after an appropriate incubation period. Sound enamel surfaces of 15 extracted premolars were demineralized and changes in fluorescence measured. RESULTS: DIAGNOdent readings > 20 were only obtained from young colonies of Prevotella and from colonies of mutans Streptococci cultured on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. Higher measurements were obtained as the bacterial colonies aged. Lower measurements were obtained after transferring colonies to glass slides. Demineralization of enamel did not affect the DIAGNOdent measurements. CONCLUSIONS: The change in fluorescence measured with DIAGNOdent has a bacterial origin rather than occurring as a result of demineralization. The measurements are presumably dependent on bacterial metabolites rather than bacteria themselves, and probably record synergistic effects during the carious process rather than the quantity or species of bacteria involved.
TI  - The effect of sucrose on plaque and saliva urease levels in vivo.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dietary sugar exposures induce an immediate drop of the plaque pH. Based on in vitro observations, it was hypothesized that oral bacteria may rapidly respond to this environmental change by increasing the activity or expression of alkali-generating pathways, such as the urease pathway. The objective of this exploratory in vivo study was to determine the short-term effect of a brief sucrose exposure on plaque and saliva urease activity and expression, and to relate this effect to caries experience. METHODS: Urease activity levels were measured in plaque and saliva samples collected from 20 children during fasting conditions and 30 min after rinsing with a sucrose solution. Streptococcus salivarius ureC-specific mRNA in saliva was quantified using real-time RT-PCR. The impact of host-related factors, such as age, gender, sugar consumption, salivary mutans streptococci levels and caries status on urease activity was evaluated. RESULTS: Plaque urease activity under fasting conditions was higher in subjects with low caries and mutans streptococci levels. This difference was not observed after the sucrose exposure. The response of urease to sucrose in vivo did not depend on caries experience or salivary mutans levels. Significant increase in urease activity of plaque and saliva after exposure to sucrose was observed only in the subjects who had low urease levels at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this exploratory study suggest that plaque urease activity may have an important long-term influence in caries development but not during a cariogenic challenge.
TI  - Infective Endocarditis: Identification of Catalase-Negative, Gram-Positive Cocci  from Blood Cultures by Partial 16S rRNA Gene Analysis and by Vitek 2 Examination.
AB  - Streptococci, enterococci and Streptococcus-like bacteria are frequent etiologic  agents of infective endocarditis and correct species identification can be a laboratory challenge. Viridans streptococci (VS) not seldomly cause contamination of blood cultures. Vitek 2 and partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene were applied in order to compare the results of both methods. STRAINS ORIGINATED FROM TWO GROUPS OF PATIENTS: 149 strains from patients with infective endocarditis and 181 strains assessed as blood culture contaminants. Of the 330 strains, based on partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing results, 251 (76%) were VS strains, 10 (3%) were pyogenic streptococcal strains, 54 (16%) were E. faecalis strains and 15 (5%) strains belonged to a group of miscellaneous catalase-negative, Gram-positive cocci. Among VS strains, respectively, 220 (87,6%) and 31 (12,3%) obtained agreeing and non-agreeing identifications with the two methods with respect to allocation to the same VS group. Non-agreeing species identification mostly occurred among strains in the contaminant group, while for endocarditis strains notably fewer disagreeing results were observed.Only 67 of 150 strains in the mitis group strains obtained identical species identifications by the two methods. Most VS strains belonging to the groups of salivarius, anginosus, and mutans obtained agreeing species identifications with the two methods, while this only was the case for 13 of the 21 bovis strains. Pyogenic strains (n=10), Enterococcus faecalis strains (n=54) and a miscellaneous group of catalase-negative, Gram-positive cocci (n=15) seemed well identified by both methods, except that disagreements in identifications in the miscellaneous group of strains occurred for 6 of 15 strains.
TI  - A novel pheromone quorum-sensing system controls the development of natural competence in Streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus salivarius.
AB  - In streptococcal species, the key step of competence development is the transcriptional induction of comX, which encodes the alternative sigma factor sigma(X), which positively regulates genes necessary for DNA transformation. In Streptococcus species belonging to the mitis and mutans groups, induction of comX relies on the activation of a three-component system consisting of a secreted pheromone, a histidine kinase, and a response regulator. In Streptococcus thermophilus, a species belonging to the salivarius group, the oligopeptide transporter Ami is essential for comX expression under competence-inducing conditions. This suggests a different regulation pathway of competence based on the production and reimportation of a signal peptide. The objective of our work was to identify the main actors involved in the early steps of comX induction in S. thermophilus LMD-9. Using a transcriptomic approach, four highly induced early competence operons were identified. Among them, we found a Rgg-like regulator (Ster_0316) associated with a nonannotated gene encoding a 24-amino-acid hydrophobic peptide (Shp0316). Through genetic deletions, we showed that these two genes are essential for comX induction. Moreover, addition to the medium of synthetic peptides derived from the C-terminal part of Shp0316 restored comX induction and transformation of a Shp0316-deficient strain. These peptides also induced competence in S. thermophilus and Streptococcus salivarius strains that are poorly transformable or not transformable. Altogether, our results show that Ster_0316 and Shp0316, renamed ComRS, are the two members of a novel quorum-sensing system responsible for comX induction in species from the salivarius group, which differs from the classical phosphorelay three-component system identified previously in streptococci.
TI  - The effect of the surface roughness of porcelain on the adhesion of oral Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - AIM: Dental plaque has a harmful influence on periodontal tissue. When a porcelain restoration is fabricated and refinishing of the glazed surface is inevitable, the increase in surface roughness facilitates the adhesion of plaque and its components. The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of surface roughness of glazed or polished porcelain on the adhesion of oral Streptococcus mutans. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 80 metal-ceramic specimens were prepared in the form of disks from two porcelain materials and divided into four groups according to the method of surface finishing. Surface roughness values (Ra-microm) for all specimens were recorded using a profilometer. S. mutans bacteria were isolated from saliva and all specimens were inoculated in test tubes containing a bacterial suspension allowing adhesion of the microorganisms to the specimens to occur. After incubation for 24 hours at 37 degrees C, the specimens were transferred to a sterile saline solution and an inoculum of 0.1 ml from each selected dilution was spread on the selective medium, mitis salivarius bacitracin agar (MSB). Bacterial counts, expressed in colony forming unit (CFU) taking into consideration the dilution factor, were recorded. RESULTS: There was significant correlation (p<0.05) between surface roughness values (Ra-microm) and the amount of bacterial adhesion (CFU x 10(3)). The glazed surface was the smoothest and exhibited the least amount of bacterial adhesion. CONCLUSION: A positive correlation between surface roughness and the amount of S. mutans adhesion was observed. The glazed porcelain surface was considered more biocompatible than other methods of porcelain surface finishing. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Chairside adjustments of the cervical contour or occlusal surface of porcelain restorations are sometimes necessary before or after cementation. Ideally, an uncemented restoration should be returned to the laboratory for reglazing after all adjustments have been completed. It is important to evaluate various polishing procedures used for these adjusted surfaces to achieve a finished surface that as closely as possible approximates the quality of glazed porcelain.
TI  - Horizontal transmission of mutans streptococci in children.
AB  - It has not been established whether transmission of mutans streptococci occurs between unrelated children older than 4 years of age. The aim of the study was to investigate the possible transmission of mutans streptococci genotypes from child to child in kindergarten. We studied 96 children (ages 5-6 yrs) in three San Francisco Bay Area public schools. Mutans streptococci colonies from each child were isolated from selective culture on Mitis Salivarius Sucrose Bacitracin agar. We used arbitrary primed polymerase chain reactions to determine the mutans streptococci genotypes. Two children (not siblings) in each of the three schools (6%) shared an identical amplitype of S. mutans, unique to each pair. The 19 S. sobrinus amplitypes were found in 12 children, and all were unique to each child. The presence of matching genotypes of S. mutans demonstrates horizontal transmission of this species between unrelated children aged 5-6 years.
TI  - Screening of Quercus infectoria gall extracts as anti-bacterial agents against dental pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A number of bacteria have now become antibiotic-resistant. This increases the importance of ayurvedic drugs. We report, here, the activity of different extracts (petroleum ether, chloroform, methanol and water) of Quercus infectoria galls against dental pathogens -- Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus acidophilus (designated) and Streptococcus sanguis (isolated). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cup-plate method was used in anti-bacterial activity of the extracts at concentration of 200 mg/ml against dental pathogens. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of most effective extracts against the most susceptible bacteria were determined using a two-fold serial micro dilution method. RESULTS: Methanolic extract showed maximum anti-bacterial activity against all the bacteria. The most susceptible bacteria were S. sanguis followed by S. aureus, S. mutans, S. salivarius and L. acidophilus. The MIC values showed that methanolic extract was more effective than water extract. CONCLUSION: The plant has the potential to generate herbal metabolites. The crude extracts demonstrating anti-dental caries activity could result in the discovery of new chemical classes of antibiotics. These chemical classes of antibiotics could serve as selective agents for the maintenance of human health and provide bio-chemical tools for the study of infectious diseases.
TI  - Partial recN gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - Partial sequences of the recN gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. The partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. The mean DNA sequence similarity of recN gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be lower than those of the 16S rRNA gene (94.1 %), rpoB (84.6 %), sodA (74.8 %), groEL (78.1 %) and gyrB (73.2 %). Phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: Streptococcus salivarius, S. equinus, S. hyovaginalis/S. pluranimalium/S. thoraltensis, S. pyogenes, S. mutans and S. suis. The 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: Streptococcus sanguinis/S. cristatus/S. sinensis, S. anginosus/S. intermedius/S. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and S. mitis/S. infantis/S. peroris/S. oralis/S. oligofermentans/S. pneumoniae/S. pseudopneumoniae. The partial recN gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. This observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groEL, gyrB, rpoB and sodA). A high percentage of similarity was found between S. intermedius and S. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recN gene. To study the genetic diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recN, groEL, sodA, gyrB and rpoB sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. The results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.
TI  - Evolutionary relationships among salivarius streptococci as inferred from multilocus phylogenies based on 16S rRNA-encoding, recA, secA, and secY gene sequences.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococci are divided into six phylogenetic groups, i.e, anginosus, bovis, mitis, mutans, pyogenic, and salivarius, with the salivarius group consisting of only three distinct species. Two of these species, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus vestibularis, are members of the normal human oral microflora whereas the third, Streptococcus thermophilus, is found in bovine milk. Given that S. salivarius and S. vestibularis share several physiological characteristics, in addition to inhabiting the same ecosystem, one would assume that they would be more closely related to each other than to S. thermophilus. However, the few phylogenetic trees published so far suggest that S. vestibularis is more closely related to S. thermophilus. To determine whether this phylogenetic relationship is genuine, we performed phylogenetic inferences derived from secA and secY, the general secretion housekeeping genes, recA, a gene from a separate genetic locus that encodes a major component of the homologous recombinational apparatus, and 16S rRNA-encoding gene sequences using other streptococcal species as outgroups. RESULTS: The maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum parsimony (MP) phylogenetic inferences derived from the secA and recA gene sequences provided strong support for the S. vestibularis/S. thermophilus sister-relationship, whereas 16S rRNA-encoding and secY-based analyses could not discriminate between alternate topologies. Phylogenetic analyses derived from the concatenation of these sequences unambiguously supported the close affiliation of S. vestibularis and S. thermophilus. CONCLUSION: Our results corroborated the sister-relationship between S. vestibularis and S. thermophilus and the concomitant early divergence of S. salivarius at the base of the salivarius lineage.
TI  - Antagonistic action of indigenous Streptococcus mutans strains.
AB  - Dental caries is an infectious process which ultimately destroys the tooth. Streptococcus mutans is considered to be the main agent causing this disease. If microorganisms with antagonistic action on S. mutans were found, they might provide a way of avoiding or controlling the disease. Within the framework of the Oral Microbial Ecology approach, the aim of this project was to identify S. mutans strains with antagonistic effect upon S. mutans. Saliva samples were taken from 66 children and cultured on Blood agar and Mitis Salivarius Bacitracin agar. They were incubated at 37 degrees C in anaerobic atmosphere for 48 hours, after which bacteria were counted and biochemical tests performed on colonies compatible with S. mutans. Antagonistic effect was determined using the double layer in agar technique. In children without and with caries, the frequency of S. mutans was 91.7% and 96.7%, respectively. In the group of patients without caries, only two strains had no antagonistic action, and three strains had full antagonistic action (100%), while the rest showed different kinds of inhibitory action. In the group of patients with caries, only 5 strains had no antagonistic action, 32 strains had full antagonistic action (100%) and the rest had variable inhibitory action. To conclude, 112 S. mutans strains with high antagonistic potential were identified, which, after other requirements are fulfilled, could be used in caries prevention or control strategies.
TI  - Oral Streptococcus species in pre-term and full-term children - a longitudinal study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite high clinical significance, the microbiology of the dental biofilm in young children remains poorly understood. AIM: The aim of this longitudinal study was to investigate five Streptoccocus species commonly found in the oral biofilm of children, namely Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Streptococcus salivarius to determine their relative numbers in caries-free pre-term children, and age-matched full-term controls. DESIGN: Plaque and saliva samples were obtained from 15 pre-term children and 15 age-matched controls at ages 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. A quantitative real-time PCR technique was used to determine the numbers of five species of Streptococcus using probes and primers specific for each bacterial species. RESULTS: All species of Streptococcus generally increased from ages 3 to 24 months. The relative ratios of the bacteria remained fairly constant at all ages studied (P > 0.1). There were no significant differences in numbers of all Streptococcus species between pre-term children and full-term controls at all the ages investigated between. CONCLUSION: The results show that the relative numbers of S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. mitis, S. sanguinis, and S. salivarius remain relatively constant from 3 to 24 months of age in caries-free pre- and full-term children.
TI  - Frequency and distribution of Mutans Streptococci in dental plaque from caries-free and caries-affected Venezuelan children.
AB  - Mutans Streptococci, in particular S. mutans and S. sobrinus, are generally considered to be the prime etiological bacteria of human dental caries. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of mutans streptococci in dental plaque in three groups of caries-free and caries-affected Venezuelan children aged 2-6, 7-12, 13-19 years, and their possible association with dental caries. The frequency of mutans streptococci was determined in samples of pooled dental plaque collected from all detectable sources of 30 (62.5%) caries-affected and 18 (37.5%) caries-free children. The samples were collected from all available tooth sites using a Hollenbak probe and immediately suspended in Ringer's solution, serially diluted and cultured in Mitis Salivarius (MS) agar for total streptococci determination and Mitis Salivarius Bacitracin (MSB) for isolation of mutans streptococci. The bacterial identification procedure was done using the API Rapid Strep System. The criteria used to determine dmft and DMFT was established by Klein and Palmer (1941). Mean dmft and DMFT were 6.4 +/- 3.2 and 4.4 +/- 2.9, respectively. Ten (33%) out of 30 caries-affected children harbored mutans streptococci. The species most frequently found were S. mutans (20%), S. sobrinus (10%) and S. rattus (3.3%). Meanwhile, in the caries-free group only 6 out of 18 children (33%) harbored mutans streptococci, specifically S. mutans and S. sobrinus, both at 17%, with no significant difference between the two groups. These results indicate that the percentage of children that harbored mutans streptococci was similar in both groups, suggesting that other acidogenic species may be responsible for caries development.
TI  - Culture-based PCR analysis of plaque samples of Japanese school children to assess the presence of six common cariogenic bacteria and its association with caries risk.
AB  - The aim of the study was to assess the presence of six common cariogenic bacteria from Cariostat-inoculated plaque samples of Japanese elementary school children through PCR analysis and check its associations with caries risk testing the validity of Cariostat as a caries risk assessment tool. This epidemiological school-based study investigated plaque samples of 399 Japanese elementary school children. Assessed using the Cariostat, 48.2% of the children had high caries risk. DNA detection of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum and both S. mutans and S. sobrinus was seen in 65.2%, 24.1%, 69.7%, 17.5%, 7.8%, 19.3%, and 17.3% of the participants, respectively. Except for S. salivarius, the presence of all other investigated bacteria resulted in a statistically significant increase among the proportion of subjects with high caries risk. Caries risk assessed using Cariostat was significantly influenced by the presence of cariogenic bacteria. Being a selective medium for cariogenic bacteria, the Cariostat can be a useful and direct source of cariogenic bacterial DNA for PCR analysis while effectively assessing caries risk.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of Caesalpinia ferrea Martius fruits against oral pathogens.
AB  - AIM: In the Amazon region of Brazil, the fruits of Caesalpinia ferrea Martius (Brazilian ironwood) are widely used as an antimicrobial and healing medicine in many situations including oral infections. This study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of Caesalpinia ferrea Martius fruit extract against oral pathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Polyphenols estimation and spectral analysis ((1)H NMR) of the methanol extract were carried out. The microorganisms Candida albicans, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus oralis and Lactobacillus casei were tested using the microdilution method for planktonic cells (MIC) and a multispecies biofilm model. Chlorhexidine was used as positive control. RESULTS: Polyphenols in the extract were estimated at 7.3% and (1)H NMR analysis revealed hydroxy phenols and methoxilated compounds. MIC values for Candida albicans, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus oralis and Lactobacillus casei were 25.0, 40.0, 66.0, 100.0, 66.0 microg/mL, respectively. For the biofilm assay, chlorhexidine and plant extract showed no growth at 10(-4) and 10(-5) microbial dilution, respectively. At 10(-4) and 10(-5) the growth values (mean+/-SD) of the negative controls (DMSO and saline solution) for Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sp. and Candida albicans were 8.1+/-0.7, 7.0+/-0.6 and 5.9+/-0.9 x 10(6)CFU, respectively. CONCLUSION: Caesalpinia ferrea fruit extract can inhibit in vitro growth of oral pathogens in planktonic and biofilm models supporting its use for oral infections.
TI  - Association of Streptococcus pluranimalium with valvular endocarditis and septicaemia in adult broiler parents.
AB  - The genus Streptococcus consists of more than 60 species, but only Streptococcus  equi subspecies zooepidemicus, Streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus, Streptococcus gallinaceus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus suis have been isolated from poultry. During investigations of the aetiology of increased mortality in broiler parent stock at the end of production, pure cultures of streptococcal-like organisms that could not be classified among these six species were obtained from 24 cases of septicaemia or valvular endocarditis and septicaemia. Phenotypic characterization using the API20 STREP kit identified the isolates as Aerococcus viridans (10), Aerococcus urinae (2), Leuconostoc species (4), Streptococcus salivarius (2), Streptococcus bovis II 3 (1), Enterococcus avium (3), Enterococcus faecium (1) or Gemella morbillorum (1). However, this identification was misleading as subsequent genetic investigations using pulse field gel electrophoresis and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes showed that 19 isolates were classified as Streptococcus pluranimalium, while the remaining isolates were E. avium (3), E. faecium (1) or Lactobacillus species (1). Misidentification by API20 STREP was related to the database provided by the manufacturer, as the phenotypic characteristics could identify these organisms as S. pluranimalium. The isolates of S. pluranimalium belonged to at least three different clones as determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis of SmaI-digested genomic DNA. The capacity that these isolates had to colonize the valvular endothelium was suggested by the occurrence of valvular endocarditis in 12 of 19 cases. Demonstration of the same clone in all four houses on a farm suggested the pathogenic potential of this organism.
TI  - Early colonization of mutans streptococci in 2- to 36-month-old Thai children.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the timing of colonization of streptococci mutans (SM) in 2- to 36-month-old Thai children. METHODS: Two hundred and two 2- to 36-month-old children were divided into 3 groups: group 1 = 84 predentate children; group 2 = 68 children with 1 to 8 erupted teeth; and group 3 = 50 children with 9 to 20 erupted teeth. Microbiological samples were obtained from children by cotton swab. Samples were diluted and plated on mitis salivarius agar supplemented with Baocitracin (MSB) for selection and enumeration of SM. RESULTS: SM colonization was found in 26% of children, who had a mean age in months of 20.5 +/- 103 (SD). MS colonization was detected in 5% of predentate children and was detected in children as young as 2 months old. The percentage of children who were colonized with SM rose significantly with increasing age and numbers of erupted teeth (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Streptococci mutans colonization in 2- to 36-month-old Thai children was found in predentate children and detected in children as young as 2 months old. The results suggest that prevention of early SM colonization in some populations may need to be initiated prior to tooth eruption.
TI  - Rhodomyrtone: a new candidate as natural antibacterial drug from Rhodomyrtus tomentosa.
AB  - Rhodomyrtone [6,8-dihydroxy-2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-7-(3-methyl-1-oxobutyl)-9-(2-methylpropyl)-4,9 -dihydro-1H-xanthene-1,3(2H)-di-one] from Rhodomyrtus tomentosa (Aiton) Hassk. displayed significant antibacterial activities against gram-positive bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus salivarius. Especially noteworthy was the activity against MRSA with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and a minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) ranging from 0.39 to 0.78 microg/ml. As shown for S. pyogenes, no surviving cells were detected within 5 and 6h after treatment with the compound at 8MBC and 4MBC concentrations, respectively. Rhodomyrtone displays no bacteriolytic activity, as determined by measurement of the optical density at 620 nm. A rhodomyrtone killing test with S. mutans using phase contrast microscopy showed that this compound caused a few morphological changes as the treated cells were slightly changed in color and bigger than the control when they were killed. Taken together, the results support the view that rhodomyrtone has a strong bactericidal activity on gram-positive bacteria, including major pathogens.
TI  - Inhibiting effects of Streptococcus salivarius on competence-stimulating peptide-dependent biofilm formation by Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The effects of Streptococcus salivarius on the competence-stimulating peptide (CSP)-dependent biofilm formation by Streptococcus mutans were investigated. METHODS: Biofilms were grown on 96-well microtiter plates coated with salivary components in tryptic soy broth without dextrose supplemented with 0.25% sucrose. Biofilm formations were stained using safranin and quantification of stained biofilms was performed by measuring absorbance at 492 nm. RESULTS: S. mutans formed substantial biofilms, whereas biofilms of S. salivarius were formed poorly in the medium conditions used. Furthermore, in combination cultures, S. salivarius strongly inhibited biofilm formation when cultured with S. mutans. This inhibition occurred in the early phase of biofilm formation and was dependent on inactivation of the CSP of S. mutans, which is associated with competence, biofilm formation, and antimicrobial activity of the bacterium, and is induced by expression of the comC gene. Comparisons between the S. mutans clinical strains FSC-3 and FSC-3DeltaglrA in separate dual-species cultures with S. salivarius indicated that the presence of the bacitracin transport ATP-binding protein gene glrA caused susceptibility to inhibition of S. mutans biofilm formation by S. salivarius, and was also associated with the regulation of CSP production by com gene-dependent quorum sensing systems. CONCLUSION: It is considered that regulation of CSP by glrA in S. mutans and CSP inactivation by S. salivarius are important functions for cell-to-cell communication between biofilm bacteria and oral streptococci such as S. salivarius. Our results provide useful information for understanding the ecosystem of oral streptococcal biofilms, as well as the competition between and coexistence of multiple species in the oral cavity.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of two Mineral Trioxide Aggregate materials in vitro evaluation.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: It has been documented that total removal of carious dentin, assessed according to clinical criteria, does not mean complete eradication of bacteria. For that reason in prevention of caries and pulp inflammations, application of the materials having high antibacterial properties seems to be indispensable. AIM: Determination of antibacterial activities of two white Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) preparations against bacteria of the genus Streptococcus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Antibacterial activities of the materials were determined by diffusion method on a solid tryptic-soy medium (Tryptic Soy Agar, Oxoid). Wells were prepared on the medium with a puncher of 7 mm diameter and 5 mm depth (four for each material). The bottom was poured with 10 microlitres of liquid TSA for sealing. Bacterial suspension was inoculated with cotton swabs onto the medium surface and then the wells were filled with the materials prepared ex tempore. The plates were left in room temperature for 30 minutes and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. Results were read by measuring the inhibition zones on day 1, 2, 3 and 8 of the culture. RESULTS: All the study samples demonstrated inhibition of bacteria of the genus Streptococcus. The antibacterial effect of MTA was maintained till the end of the experiment (day 8). ProRoot White showed slightly larger inhibition zone against Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus sanguis as compared to MTA white Angelus. The mean inhibition zones against Streptococcus mutans appeared the same for both test materials. CONCLUSION: The two MTA preparations assessed in the current study show good antibacterial action against the standard strains Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus salivarius.
TI  - Pimarane-type diterpenes: antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens.
AB  - Seven pimarane type-diterpenes re-isolated from Viguiera arenaria Baker and two semi-synthetic pimarane derivatives were evaluated in vitro against the following main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: Streptococcus salivarius, S. sobrinus, S. mutans, S. mitis, S. sanguinis and Lactobacillus casei. The compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid (PA); ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol; ent-15-pimarene-8beta,19-diol; ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-acetoxy and the sodium salt derivative of PA were the most active compounds, displaying MIC values ranging from 2 to 8 microg mL(-1). Thus, this class of compounds seems promising as a class of new effective anticariogenic agents. Furthermore, our results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new natural compounds that could be employed in the development of oral care products.
TI  - Phylogenetic analyses and detection of viridans streptococci based on sequences and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of the rod shape-determining protein gene.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Population analysis of viridans streptococci is important because these species are associated with dental caries, bacteremia, and subacute endocarditis, in addition to being important members of the human oral commensal microbiota. DESIGN: In this study, we phylogenetically analyzed the rod shape-determining protein gene (rodA), which is associated with cellular morphology, cell division, and sensitivity for antibiotics, and demonstrated that the diversity of the rodA gene is sufficient to identify viridans streptococci at the species level. Moreover, we developed a more convenient denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) method based on the diversity of the rodA gene (rodA-DGGE) for detecting nine dominant streptococcal species in human saliva, namely, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus vestibularis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sobrinus. RESULTS: This rodA-DGGE method proved useful in detecting viridans streptococci without cultivation, isolation, and phenotypic characterization. CONCLUSION: Analysis of the oral microbiota by rodA-DGGE offers a higher resolution than the conventional DGGE using 16S rDNA and may be an alternative in the microbial diagnosis of streptococcal infection.
TI  - Salivary secretory IgA, pH, flow rates, mutans streptococci and Candida in children with rampant caries.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the levels of secretory IgA (SIgA), pH, flow rates, mutans streptococci (MS) and Candida in saliva of children with rampant caries compared to those caries-free. Thirty children (age 62-123 months) were enrolled and divided into two groups: Group I, children with rampant caries, Group II, caries-free children. The average salivary flow rate was measured from the volume yielded within 5 minutes and the pH was determined using a pH-electrode. Measurement of SIgA was performed using an immunoassay kit. The levels of MS and Candida were determined by culture on Mitis-Salivarius Bacitracin agar and Sabouraud dextrose agar. It was found that children with rampant caries presented with significantly higher levels of salivary SIgA, MS and Candida. However, the mean values for salivary flow rates and pH were similar between the groups. The results reveal that children with rampant caries had significantly higher levels of SIgA, MS and Candida in their oral cavities. This finding tends to support the hypothesis that higher levels of salivary SIgA may reflect a past exposure of the host to cariogenic microorganisms.
TI  - Reduction in bacterial contamination of toothbrushes using the Violight ultraviolet light activated toothbrush sanitizer.
AB  - PURPOSE: This two armed, self-controlled, investigator blinded, clinical study tested the efficacy of an ultraviolet (UV) light toothbrush holder (Violight) to decrease toothbrush bacterial contamination. METHODS: 25 subjects were randomly assigned to control or experimental groups and received two toothbrushes for home use on either even or odd days. The control group rinsed both toothbrushes after use in cold tap water with no mechanical manipulation. The experimental group rinsed one toothbrush in cold running water while storing the other toothbrush in the Violight toothbrush holder after use. The toothbrushes were returned after 2 weeks use in sealed plastic bags and were analyzed for the number of colony forming units (CFU) of S. mutans, S. salivarius, lactobacilli, E. coli, and other coliforms, and total bacterial counts by culture. An additional analysis of the total bacterial profile was performed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). RESULTS: The Violight toothbrush holder reduced total CFU by an average of 86% (ANCOVA, P = 0.037). In addition, a tendency was noted for a reduction in total bacterial population as detected by DGGE.
TI  - A novel method for the identification of saliva by detecting oral streptococci using PCR.
AB  - We have used DNA amplification methods to detect common oral bacterial strains to test for the presence of saliva in forensic samples. Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus mutans were detected in various forms of saliva samples, whereas these streptococci were not detected in semen, urine, vaginal fluid, or on skin surfaces. Therefore, we demonstrated that these streptococci are promising new marker for the forensic identification of saliva. Our data indicated that S. salivarius is more reliable than S. mutans as an indicator of saliva presence, because the detection rates for S. salivarius and S. mutans by this method were 100% and 90%, respectively. Furthermore, S. salivarius was detected in all saliva stain samples, whereas S. mutans was only identified in 60% of the stains. Finally, using this method we were able to successfully detect S. salivarius and S. mutans in mock forensic samples. We therefore suggested that this method is useful for the identification of saliva in forensic science.
TI  - Sodium fluoride and chlorhexidine effect in the inhibition of mutans streptococci in children with dental caries: a randomized, double-blind clinical trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare the effect of sodium fluoride and chlorhexidine on salivary levels of mutans streptococci (MS), in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial. METHODS: Thirty-five healthy volunteers, aged 4-8 years, with at least one active carious lesion and no previous history of allergies were selected to participate in the study. A gel formulation containing either 1.23% sodium fluoride or 1% chlorhexidine was topically administered to the dentition every 24 h for 6 consecutive days. Salivary MS levels were measured at baseline (D1) and on the 6th (D6), 15th (D15), and 30th (D30) days. For microbiological analysis, Mitis Salivarius-Bacitracin agar medium was used. RESULTS: Difference between treatments was only verified on D6. On the last day of treatment 1% chlorhexidine gel was significantly more effective than fluoride (P = 0.0000). The use of sodium fluoride did not cause a statistically significant variation in salivary MS levels throughout the duration of the study. Following treatment, a subsequent increase in MS counts between D6 and D15 (P = 0.0001) was observed with chlorhexidine. CONCLUSION: A 6-day treatment with a 1% chlorhexidine gel was effective in reducing salivary MS; there was a significant MS increase once treatment was suspended. The use of 1.23% sodium fluoride under the same regimen was not able to reduce salivary MS levels. Our results suggest repeated treatment with 1% chlorhexidine as a means for maintaining low salivary MS levels in children with dental caries.
TI  - Bacteriocins in S. mutans strains isolated from children with and without dental  caries: biotypes and sensitivity to antibiotics.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the production of bacteriocins in the Streptococcus mutans strains isolated from children with and without dental caries. With this purpose the dmft index was determined and non-stimulated saliva was collected from 53 3- to 5-year-old children. The samples were cultured on Mitis Salivarius Bacitracin agar and incubated anaerobically for two days at 37 degrees C. The isolates were biotyped using the Api-ZYM enzymatic system (bioMerieux; Marcy-lE'toile, France). Bacteriocin was detected using the double layer onto brain heart infusion agar technique and the minimal inhibitory concentrations of the isolates were evaluated against penicillin, amoxycillin, cefazolin, erythromycin, clindamycin, imipenem and vancomycin using an agar dilution method. The dental caries experience in these children was 66% (35/53) and dmft index average was 3.2 (range 2-6). S. mutans was found in the saliva of 33 children (62%). In the 33 strains of S. mutans, 10 biotypes were found. Eight (24%) of the 33 strains evaluated produced bacteriocins, 6 of these strains came from patients with dental caries and the other two from patients without dental caries. All isolates were highly sensitive to the antibiotics tested.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of kaurane diterpenes against oral pathogens.
AB  - Two kaurane diterpenes, ent-kaur-16(17)-en-19-oic acid (KA) and 15-beta-isovaleryloxy-ent-kaur-16(17)-en-19-oic acid (KA-Ival), isolated from Aspilia foliacea, and the methyl ester derivative of KA (KA-Me) were evaluated against oral pathogens. KA was the most active compound, with MIC values of 10 microg mL(-1) against the following microorganisms: Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Lactobacillus casei. However, KA did not show significant activity against Streptococcus salivarius and Enterococcus faecalis, with MIC values equal to 100 and 200 microg mL(-1), respectively. Our results show that KA has potential to be used as a prototype for the discovery of new effective anti-infection agents against microorganisms responsible for caries and periodontal diseases. Moreover, these results allow to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to studies on the structure-activity relationship of this type of metabolites with respect to caries and periodontal diseases.
TI  - Short-term relative antibacterial effect of octenidine dihydrochloride on the oral microflora in orthodontically treated patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of common antiseptic mouth rinses and octenidine dihydrochloride (OCT). METHODS: The antibacterial activities of antiseptics against total and cariogenic bacteria (Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus species) in saliva were studied in vitro and in vivo. After unstimulated saliva was collected, one of the mouth rinse solutions was applied for 30seconds. Saliva samples were collected 15, 30, 60, and 120min later and evaluated for their bacterial count. RESULTS: OCT had a significantly greater inhibitory effect on the studied bacteria than 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) and 7.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine complex (PVP-I) from 15min to 120min following the application (p<0.01). The antiseptic efficacy of 0.2% CHX on total bacteria and Lactobacillus species was very similar to the efficacy observed with 7.5% PVP-I mouth solution from 15min up to 120min. Streptococcus mutans was completely inhibited by 0.15mg/ml PVP-I, 0.5mg/ml CHX, and 0.1mg/ml OCT concentrations, while Streptococcus salivarius was inhibited by 0.15mg/ml PVP-I, 2mg/ml CHX, and 0.8mg/ml OCT concentrations. Lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis was inhibited with 0.00313mg/ml OCT, 30mg/ml PVP-I, and 0.0063mg/ml CHX concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: OCT compared favorably with CHX and PVP-I in its antibacterial effects, both in vitro and in vivo (p<0.01).
TI  - A quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. This can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. In this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. METHODS: Fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. Microorganisms were enumerated and identified. Bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated PBS solution for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. RESULTS: Counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) CFU. Candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. No obligate anaerobes were isolated. Members of Streptococcaceae family were regularly found (65.2%) belonging to the following species: Streptococcus pyogenes, S. mutans, S. mitis, S. oralis, S. sobrinus, S. viridans, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Aerococcus viridans. A. viridans and S. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis were found on adults brushes. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp. and Enterococcus sp., were also recovered. We found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. However, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. Decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. CONCLUSIONS: Ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. Maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.
TI  - Fluoride release and antibacterial activity of selected dental materials.
AB  - The aim of the study was to assess the fluoride ion release and antibacterial activities of the glassionomer cement Fuji IX and the compomer (composite modified polyacid) Dyract AP. Fluoride ion release was measured using direct potentiometry with an Orion fluoride ion selective electrode. The measurement was carried out after 1, 4, 7, 14, 30, and 60 days of storage in phosphate buffer at pH 6.8. The antibacterial activity of the materials was evaluated against the bacteria Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35668, Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419, Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556, and Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei ATCC 393. The agar diffusion test was applied. The material specimens were assessed twice: after setting and seven days later. Zones of bacterial growth inhibition were measured in millimeters after 24 hours. The results of the study showed that both materials released ion fluoride, with a higher emission of Fuji IX than Dyract AP. The highest level of emission was observed on the seventh day of the study in both materials. After 24 hours of bonding there was inhibition of bacterial growth by Fuji IX, whereas Dyract AP did not show similar activity. On the eighth day after polymerization, Dyract AP was significantly more active towards Streptococcus sanguis and salivarius.
TI  - Colonization of mutans streptococci in Costa Rican children from a high-risk population.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to determine the colonization of mutans streptococci (MS) in dental biofilm and saliva of children from a high-risk population with low socioeconomic status from San Jose, Costa Rica. METHODS: A total of 68 healthy babies from 8 to 20 months of age (mean age=13 months), with caries-free status and cariogenic feeding habits (eg, nursing bottle- or breast-feeding on demand) were examined. Children divided in two groups (<13 months and 14-20 months). Samples from dental biofilm and saliva from each subject were processed and plated in blood agar (BA) and Mitis-Salivarius-Bacitracin agar (MSB) to determine MS percentage. Statistical analysis included the analysis of variance test, and stratification by age of MS levels. RESULTS: Detectable MS levels in dental biofilm and saliva were found in 75% and 72% of children, respectively. Counts higher than 20000 colony forming units (CFU) per ml were found in 4% of saliva and in 35% of biofilm samples. The two groups showed significant differences in MS levels for dental biofilm (P=.036) and saliva (P=.009). Children older than 17 months presented higher MS levels (P<.05). Analysis by MS levels (<0.1%; 0.1-1.0%;>1.0% of MS) The two groups showed an insignificant association with increasing mean age. MS density was associated with mean number of erupted primary molars. CONCLUSIONS: Mutans streptococci colonization of dental biofilm and saliva from high caries risk infants is associated with age and dental development.
TI  - [Effects of oral streptococci on biofilm formation by cariogenic bacteria in dual species cultures].
AB  - The effects of oral commensal streptococci (Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mitis, and Streptococcus salivarius) on biofilm formation by cariogenic mutans streptococci (Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus) were investigated. Cell suspensions were cultured on 96-well microtiter plates coated with or without salivary components (SC), and in flow cell systems coated with SC in tryptic soy broth including 0.25% sucrose without dextrose (TSB). The resultant biofilm formations were stained using safranin or a LIVE/DEAD BacLight Viability Kit, and examined with absorbance at 492 nm or using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Mutans streptococci and S. sanguinis biofilms were formed significantly on the polystyrene surfaces in TSB. Further, in combination cultures, S. sanguinis formed a sufficient biofilm when cultured with S. mutans. However, when S. sanguinis was cultured with S. sobrinus, biofilm formation was slightly inhibited. S. gordonii also inhibited biofilm formation in the culture with S. sobrinus, but not when cultured with S. mutans. S. mitis and S. salivarius collapsed the biofilm morphology and inhibited volume development in some conditions when cultured with S. mutans or S. sobrinus. Biofilm formation by mutans streptococci was challenged and collapsed on the whole by culturing with each of the other oral streptococci. These results indicate that co-culturing of multiple species of mutans streptococci and other oral streptococci has physical effects related to previous attachment and colonization on the surface, as well as biological effects to regulate biofilm formation.
TI  - Purification of bacteriocin LS1 produced by human oral isolate Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1, a human oral isolate with antagonistic activity against growth of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus flavus, and Salmonella enteritidis, probably produces more than one proteinaceous antimicrobial substance. The objective of this study was the purification of a bacteriocin, named LS1, produced by L. salivarius BGHO1. METHODS: A simple and fast procedure for bacteriocin purification was developed, consisting of reverse-phase chromatography of the ammonium sulfate precipitate of cell-free culture supernatant by fast protein liquid chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography, followed by tricine sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), with the subsequent extraction of bacteriocin from the gel. RESULTS: The supernatant of L. salivarius BGHO1 culture retained its antimicrobial activity after boiling in a water bath for 15 min. Its antimicrobial activity was also maintained even after treatment for 20 min at 121 degrees C in an autoclave. Bacteriocin LS1 was purified to homogeneity. The molecular mass of bacteriocin LS1 was estimated to be approximately 10 kDa, based on tricine SDS-PAGE. During purification, another compound with antimicrobial activity, produced by L. salivarius BGHO1, was detected. The molecular mass of this compound was estimated to be approximately 5 kDa, based on tricine SDS-PAGE. CONCLUSION: Our results imply that LS1 is most probably a new bacteriocin, different from previously described bacteriocins produced by L. salivarius strains. The purification of bacteriocin LS1 enabled the further characterization of LS1 on both the molecular and genetic levels.
TI  - New serotype of mutans streptococci isolated from pig oral cavity.
AB  - Gram-positive streptococcal mutans-like strains, but with clearly different colony formation than S. orisuis on Mitis Salivarius agar, were isolated from the pig oral cavity and identified by 16S rRNA sequencing, G+C content, DNA-DNA homology and extensive biochemical and serological testing. The phenotypic data showed that the strains were similar to S. orisuis except for susceptibility to bacitracin. DNA-DNA homology between the isolates and S. orisuis was 72~81%. However, serological data showed that they have a different sero-specific antigen from S. orisuis and other mutans streptococci. A new serotype, designated p, strains are classified in a serovar of S. orisuis, one of mutans streptococci.
TI  - Characterization of oral lactobacilli as potential probiotics for oral health.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Intestinal lactobacilli have been successfully used as probiotics to treat gastrointestinal disorders, but only limited data are available for the probiotic properties of oral lactobacilli to combat oral diseases. We aimed to characterize oral lactobacilli for their potential probiotic properties according to the international guidelines for the evaluation of probiotics, and to select potential probiotic strains for oral health. METHODS: The study included 67 salivary and subgingival lactobacilli of 10 species, isolated from healthy humans. All strains were identified using amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis, tested for antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens, tolerance of low pH and bile content. Thereafter, the lysozyme tolerance and antibiotic susceptibility of 22 potential probiotic strains were assessed. RESULTS: The majority of strains suppressed the growth of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Streptococcus mutans, but none inhibited Candida albicans. The lowest pH tolerated by lactobacilli following 4 h of incubation was pH 2.5, but none of the strains grew at this pH. All strains tolerated a high concentration of lysozyme (10 mg/ml) and half of the strains tolerated a high concentration of human bile [5% volume/volume (V/V)]. Four Lactobacillus plantarum and two Lactobacillus oris strains expressed resistance to tetracycline and/or doxycycline. CONCLUSIONS: Strains of L. plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus expressed both high antimicrobial activity and high tolerance of environmental stress. The absence of transferable antibiotic-resistance genes in L. plantarum strains remains to be confirmed. These results suggest a potential for oral lactobacilli to be used as probiotics for oral health.
TI  - Streptococcus dentirousetti sp. nov., isolated from the oral cavities of bats.
AB  - Seventy-three strains of streptococci were isolated from the bat oral cavity. The colonies of strains grown on mitis salivarius agar were similar in morphology to those of mutans-like streptococci. The novel strains were analysed biochemically using the Rapid ID32 Strep microsystem and were subjected to DNA-DNA hybridization with other oral streptococci and to 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Based on phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence, it is proposed that these isolates be classified as Streptococcus dentirousetti sp. nov. The type strain of Streptococcus dentirousetti sp. nov. is NUM 1303(T) (=JCM 14596(T)=DSM 18963(T)).
TI  - New culture media for the isolation of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus in  the saliva of head- and neck-irradiated patients.
AB  - The reduction in salivary flow in patients subjected to head and neck irradiation induces changes in the oral microflora and increases the risk of oral mucosal infections. The frequent presence of fungi, particularly Candida, in the oral environment of these patients complicates identification of the most important cariogenic bacteria with the commercial CRT Bacteria (Ivoclar Vivadent) culture media. Such identification is important for the application of chemical measures to control cariogenic bacteria in these patients, since it has been shown that simple fluoride application is unable to control caries in this population. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to obtain a simple medium that inhibits Candida spp. growth and allows the specific growth of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus spp. Thus, reliable counts of cariogenic species can be achieved. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Stimulated saliva samples from 30 head- and neck-radiotherapy patients were seeded in commercial CRT Bacteria culture medium and in two different media designed by our group: mitis salivarius bacitracin agar (MSBA), containing 5% potassium tellurite and fluconazole 64 microg/ml (MSBTPF) for the isolation of Streptococcus; and Man, Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) agar, containing bacitracin 0.2 U/ml and fluconazole 32 microg/ml (MRSBF) for the isolation of Lactobacillus spp. RESULTS: Candida growth was inhibited 100% in the media developed in this study. In all the samples seeded, growing of colonies in MRSBF was identified as Lactobacillus, while in CRT Bacteria for Lactobacillus spp. this species was only isolated in 48.1% of the samples. S. mutans was identified in 71.4% of the colonies that grown in MSBTPF medium, while in CRT Bacteria for S. mutans, this species was only identified in 35% of the colonies obtained. CONCLUSION: The culture medium developed in the present study was able to inhibit the 100% of Candida spp. growth. These new media permit reliable counts of cariogenic bacteria in irradiated patients.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of triterpene acids and semi-synthetic derivatives against oral pathogens.
AB  - Triterpene acids (ursolic, oleanoic, gypsogenic, and sumaresinolic acids) isolated from Miconia species, along with a mixture of ursolic and oleanolic acids and a mixture of maslinic and 2-a-hydroxyursolic acids, as well as ursolic acid derivatives were evaluated against the following microorganisms: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sobrinus, and Enterococcus faecalis, which are potentially responsible for the formation of dental caries in humans. The microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) during the evaluation of the antibacterial activity. All the isolated compounds, mixtures, and semi-synthetic derivatives displayed activity against all the tested bacteria, showing that they are promising antiplaque and anticaries agents. Ursolic and oleanolic acids displayed the most intense antibacterial effect, with MIC values ranging from 30 microg/mL to 80 microg/mL. The MIC values of ursolic acid derivatives, as well as those obtained for the mixture of ursolic and oleanolic acids showed that these compounds do not have higher antibacterial activity when compared with the activity observed with either ursolic acid or oleanolic acid alone. With regard to the structure-activity relationship of triterpene acids and derivatives, it is suggested that both hydroxy and carboxy groups present in the triterpenes are important for their antibacterial activity against oral pathogens.
TI  - Inhibitory activity of garlic (Allium sativum) extract on multidrug-resistant Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Garlic (Allium sativum) extract has been known to have inhibitory activity on various pathogenic bacteria, viruses and fungi. The objective of present investigation was to study in vitro inhibitory activity of garlic extract on multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of Streptococcus mutans isolated from human carious teeth. Filter sterilized aqueous extract of garlic was prepared and used in the present study. For isolation of S. mutans, extracted human carious teeth were cultured in Todd-Hewit broth and Mitis-Salivarius-Bacitracin agar. S. mutans was characterized by colony morphology, biochemical tests and other conventional bacteriological procedures. Disk sensitivity tests and broth dilution methods were used to determine antibiotic sensitivity profile and inhibitory activity of garlic extract on S. mutans isolated from carious teeth. Of 105 carious teeth tested, 92 (87.6%) isolates of S. mutans were recovered, among which 28 (30.4%) were MDR since they were resistant to four or more antibiotics. The highest rate of resistance was observed for tetracycline (30.4%) and least resistance (0%) to teichoplanin and vancomycin while 22.8% and 23.9% of the isolates were resistant to penicillin and amoxicillin, respectively. Chlorhexidine minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for MDR and non-MDR S. mutans varied from 2 to 16 microg ml(-1) and from 0.25 to 1 microg ml(-1), respectively (P<0.05). All isolates, MDR and non-MDR of S. mutans were sensitive to garlic extract with the MIC ranging from 4 to 32 microg ml(-1). Considering in vitro data obtained in the present study, mouthwashes or toothpaste containing optimum concentration of garlic extract could be used for prevention of dental caries.
TI  - The effect of mango and neem extract on four organisms causing dental caries: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivavius, Streptococcus mitis, and Streptococcus sanguis: an in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Chewing twigs of the mango or neem tree is a common way of cleaning the teeth in the rural and semi-urban population. These twigs are also believed to possess medicinal properties. The present study was conducted to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of these chewing sticks on the microorganisms Streptococcus mutans , Streptococcus salivarius , Streptococcus mitis , and Streptococcus sanguis which are involved in the development of dental caries. An additional objective was to identify an inexpensive, simple, and effective method of preventing and controlling dental caries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sticks were sun dried, ground into a coarse powder, and weighed into 5 gm, 10 gm, and 50 gm amounts. These were added to 100 ml of deionized distilled water. After soaking for 48 h at 4 degrees C, the water was filtered. The filtrate was inoculated onto blood agar plates containing individual species of microorganisms and incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h. RESULTS: Mango extract, at 50% concentration, showed maximum zone of inhibition on Streptococcus mitis . Neem extract produced the maximum zone of inhibition on Streptococcus mutans at 50% concentration. Even at 5% concentration neem extract showed some inhibition of growth for all the four species of organisms. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION: A combination of neem and mango chewing sticks may provide the maximum benefit. We recommend the use of both the chewing sticks.
TI  - The effect of antibacterial monomer MDPB on the growth of organisms associated with root caries.
AB  - MDPB, 12-methacryloyloxydodecylpyridinium bromide, was tested for its ability to  inhibit the growth of organisms associated with active root caries lesions and to modify the growth characteristics of these organisms at sub-MICs. MICs and MBCs of MDPB for independent isolates (n=5) of the following taxa: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus salivarius, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces gerensceriae, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Lactobacillus spp., and Candida albicans were determined, and the effects at sub-MIC on microbial growth kinetics were assessed. All isolates were sensitive to inhibition by MDPB. The median MICs and MBCs of MDPB for these organisms were in the range of 3.13 to 25.0 microg/ml and 6.25 to 50.0 microg/ml, respectively. As for the influence of pH, inhibition was sensitive to acidic pH. Even at sub-MICs, the growth of all strains, measured as cell yield and doubling time, was significantly reduced. Based on the results of this study, MDPB exhibited the potential to inhibit the growth of microbiota associated with active root caries lesions.
TI  - Toothbrush bristle wear and adherence of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was conducted to determine if bristle wear impacts the adherence of Streptococcus mutans on toothbrushes and to evaluate whether it affects the extent of adherence at 0, 8, and 24 hours after air-drying. METHODS: Sixty toothbrushes--composed of 20 each from 3 different groups and defined by brand, brush trim, and head shape--were used in this study. Bristle wear on half of the toothbrushes was achieved using an orthodontic typodont with metal bonds and brackets and evaluated by 4 independent observers. New and worn toothbrushes were inoculated with 5 mutans, rinsed in tap water, and air-dried for 0, 8, and 24 hours. Four tufts were removed from the brush heads at each time point, placed in saline and vortexed to remove bacteria. Bacteria were aerobically grown on Mitis Salivarius Agar plates until colony-forming units could be counted. RESULTS: The toothbrush group impacts adherence of 5 mutans on both new and worn toothbrushes at 0, 8, and 24 hours after air-drying, with new toothbrushes harboring significantly more S mutans than worn toothbrushes at 0 hours. CONCLUSIONS: The results have implications for the design of toothbrush tufts as well as storage of toothbrushes in the home.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of the mutans streptococci from the dental plaques in Koreans.
AB  - Mutans streptococci have been implicated as cariogenic bacteria in dental caries  because they can produce high levels of dental caries-causing lactic acid and extracellular polysaccharide. The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize the mutans streptococci from the dental plaque obtained from Koreans. The dental plaque samples were collected from the anterior and molar teeth of both jaws in 155 subjects (aged 2 to 33.2 years, average age 13.7+/-4.7 years). The samples were diluted by 100-fold in 1x PBS and plated on mitis-salivarius bacitracin (MSB) agar plates. The mutans streptococci grown on MSB plates were screened by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) targeting dextranase gene (dex). The mutans streptococci were identified at the species level using a 16S rDNA sequencing comparison method. The biochemical tests were carried out to biotype the mutans streptococci. Ninety-five strains of the mutans streptococci out of 358 colonies, which were derived from 141 subjects, were isolated. Of them, 77 strains and 18 strains were Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus, respectively. The biotyping data showed that 62, 1, 20, 10, and 2 strains were biotypes I, II, IV, V and variant, respectively. Of the two strains of variant biotype, one strains was similar to biotype IV except that it was positive to the arginine hydrolysis test. We considered this one strain a new biotype, and classified it as biotype VII. In conclusion, S. mutans and its biotype I was most frequently isolated in Korean dental plaque. The mutans streptococci strains isolated in this study might be useful for the study of the pathogenesis and the prevention of dental caries.
TI  - Effect of an alcoholic diet on dental caries and on Streptococcus of the mutans group. Study in rats.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of an alcohol diet on Streptococcus of the mutans group and on dental caries in the oral cavity of rats. Forty animals were divided into 3 groups according to the following liquid diets: 20% ethanol solution (Alcohol Group, AG), 27% sucrose solution (Isocaloric Group, IG), and water (Control Group, CG). After 56 days, samples were collected and plated on Mitis Salivarius Bacitracin agar to assess the number of colony forming units (CFU/mL) of Streptococcus of the mutans group. The animals were sacrificed and the jaws were removed in order to assess the occurrence of dental caries on the smooth and occlusal surfaces using stereomicroscopy. The data were submitted to ANOVA and Tukey test. The average numbers of CFU/mL (10(3)) were: 8.17 (AG), 9.78 (IG), and 5.63 (CG). There was no significant difference among the groups for the occurrence of occlusal caries. Regarding smooth surface caries, in the upper jaw, the caries number in the IG (1.58) was similar to that in the AG (2.06) and in the CG (1.14), and the number of caries in the AG was higher than in the CG; in the lower jaw there was significant difference among the 3 groups: AG (1.14), IG (2.00) and CG (0.43). The diets with the alcohol and sucrose solutions presented a tendency of increasing the colonization by Streptococcus of the mutans group and of increasing the occurrence of smooth surface dental caries in rat molars when compared to the control diet.
TI  - Streptococcus orisuis sp. nov., isolated from the pig oral cavity.
AB  - Five bacterial strains, designated as NUM 1001(T), NUM 1002, NUM 1003, NUM 1004 and NUM 1005, were isolated from the oral cavities of pigs. Colonies grown on mitis salivarius agar were similar in morphology to those of mutans streptococci. The novel isolates were analysed biochemically using the Rapid ID 32 Strep microsystem, subjected to DNA-DNA hybridization with oral streptococci and had their 16S rRNA genes sequenced. On the basis of the phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence obtained, the strains represent a novel species of the genus Streptococcus, for which the name Streptococcus orisuis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NUM 1001(T) (=JCM 14035(T)=DSM 18307(T)).
TI  - Discrepancy in antimicrobial susceptibility test results obtained for oral streptococci with the Etest and agar dilution.
AB  - A total of 270 viridans group streptococci (VS) isolated from healthy children, identified to the species level, were tested for their susceptibilities to penicillin, imipenem, erythromycin, and vancomycin. A total of 270 isolates and 1,080 organism-antibiotic combinations were evaluated. The overall susceptibility rates of all isolates obtained by the Etest (ET) versus agar dilution (AD) were 60.4% versus 61.8% for penicillin, 63.8% versus 63.9% for erythromycin, 90.6% versus 96% for vancomycin, and 99.1% versus 96.0% for imipenem, respectively. Major discrepancies occurred in the testing of the susceptibility of Streptococcus mutans to vancomycin, with 59.5% (ET) versus 100% (AD), followed by S. salivarius, with 84.1% versus 100%; S. oralis, with 82.1% versus 96.4%; and S. mitis, with 90% versus 100%, respectively. There were also differences in the rates of susceptibility of S. mutans, 66.5% (ET) versus 85.1% (AD), and S. intermedius, 82.9% versus 72.1%, respectively, to penicillin. General agreement between the results of ET and AD was obtained for 973 organism-antibiotic combinations out of 1,080 antibiotic combinations, i.e., 90.1%. Very major errors were found for 6.8% of isolates, and major errors were found for 3.2% of isolates; the minor errors were negligible. Agreement between the results of the two methods was 98.7% for penicillin, 94.6% for vancomycin, 96.9% for imipenem, and 99.9% for erythromycin. The highest rate of very major errors was for vancomycin, at 5.4%. The ET appears to be as efficient as AD for susceptibility testing of VS, except for vancomycin, where very major errors in the results were relatively high.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of garlic against oral streptococci.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of two garlic clones' (1: purple and 2: white) crude extracts against oral microbiota was evaluated in vitro (study 1) and in vivo (study 2). Study 1 consisted of the evaluation of minimum inhibitory (MIC) and bactericidal (MBC) concentrations against nine streptococci strains. In study 2, a 2.5% garlic (clone 2) solution was used as a mouthwash in a 5-week study by 30 subjects. Blood agar and Mitis Salivarius Bacitracin agar were inoculated with subjects' saliva to quantify oral microorganisms and mutans streptococci. Study 1 showed MIC ranging from 0.5 to 32.0 mg ml(-1) for clone 2 and from 8 to 64.0 mg ml(-1) for clone 1. MBC ranged from 1.0 to 128.0 mg ml(-1) and from 8.0 to 128.0 mg ml(-1) regarding clones 2 and 1 respectively. Study 2 showed that 2.5% garlic mouthwash solution had good antimicrobial activity against mutans streptococci and oral microorganisms. Maintenance of reduced salivary levels of streptococci was observed after 2 weeks at the end of mouthwash use. Unpleasant taste (100%), halitosis (90%) and nausea (30%) were reported by subjects after the end of the study. It was concluded that the garlic clones have antimicrobial properties in vitro against streptococci and anticariogenic properties against oral microorganism in spite of its adverse effects.
TI  - Molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. METHODS: Samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. On the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. The isolates were determined as Lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16S rDNA. Sequencing of 16S rDNA genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies levels. RESULTS: Predominant species were Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus cellobiosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus gasseri were also present. The isolates Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1, Lactobacillus fermentum BGHO36 and BGHO64, Lactobacillus gasseri BGHO89 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis BGHO99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus flavus, Salmonella enteritidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of Candida albicans. Moreover, the isolates L. salivarius BGHO1 and L. gasseri BGHO89 were tolerant to low pH and high concentration of bile salts. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these findings imply that L. salivarius BGHO1 and L. gasseri BGHO89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.
TI  - Production of monoclonal antibodies against Streptococcus mutans antigens.
AB  - Several studies have been conducted in the last decades aiming to obtain an anti-caries vaccine, however some studies have demonstrated cross reactivity between Streptococcus mutans surface antigens and the human cardiac tissue. In this work, the reactivity of five anti-Streptococcus mutans monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) (24A, 56G, C8, E8 and F6) was tested against oral streptococci, cardiac antigens and skeletal and cardiac myosins, aiming to evaluate the specificity of these MoAb. The hybrid producers of immunoglobulins of the IgG2b class were cloned by limit dilution and expanded in vivo. MoAb were tested by ELISA. The hybrid 24A reacted with S. mutans CCT 1910, S. salivarius CCT 0365 and S. pyogenes T23. No reactivity difference was observed among the tested species. Cross reactivity with heart and cardiac myosin was not confirmed and only reaction with myosin of skeletal muscle was observed (p = 0.0381). The hybrid 56G reacted with all the tested microorganisms and there was statistically significant difference between S. mutans and S. pyogenes T23 (p < 0.001). This hybrid also reacted with myosin of skeletal muscle (p = 0.0095). C8, E8 and F6 presented low reactivity against oral streptococci strains and no reactivity against cardiac antigens. The data of this study showed that the 24A and 56G anti-S. mutans MoAb presented reactivity with S. pyogenes and S. salivarius, reinforcing the occurrence of common antigens between these species. The tested MoAb presented low cross-reactivity with myosin of skeletal muscle, but anti-heart activity could not be confirmed.
TI  - Surface antibacterial properties of resin and resin-modified dental cements.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cements possessing antibacterial properties may reduce bacteria-induced fixed partial denture complications. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial properties of 4 dental cements using the direct contact test (DCT) and the agar diffusion test (ADT). METHOD AND MATERIALS: The ADT was performed using mitis salivarius agar plates. Each plate was evenly inoculated with freshly grown mutans streptococci. Two samples of each test material-RelyX ARC, Variolink II, GC FujiCEM, and Principle-were placed, and the inhibition halo obtained was measured after 48 hours. For the DCT, 8 samples were placed on the sidewalls of wells in a 96-well microtiter plate. After polymerization, freshly grown Streptococcus mutans cells (1 X 10(6)) were placed on the surface of each sample for 1 hour at 37 degrees C. Fresh medium was then added to each well, and bacterial growth was followed for 16 hours in a temperature-controlled spectrophotometer. Similarly prepared samples were aged in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 or 7 days and the DCT was repeated. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey multiple comparisons were applied to the data. RESULTS: In the ADT, GC FujiCEM showed an inhibition zone of 2.0 +/- 0.3 mm, and Principle showed an inhibition zone of 1.2 +/- 0.2 mm. In the DCT, freshly polymerized samples of GC FujiCEM and Principle exhibited potent antibacterial properties, while samples of Variolink II and RelyX ARC showed moderate antibacterial properties. Principle showed some antibacterial properties even after 1 day (P < .001). CONCLUSION: None of the tested cements in this study possesses long-term antibacterial properties.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological effect of calcium hydroxide protection in indirect pulp capping in primary teeth.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate clinically and microbiologically the effect of calcium hydroxide (CH) on carious dentin on primary teeth submitted to indirect pulp capping (IPC). METHODS: Twenty 4-7 year-old subjects with 42 treated teeth participated in the study. The treatment consisted of incomplete excavation of the demineralized dentin, application of a CH or gutta-percha (GP) layer and sealing with a resin-based composite for 4-7 months. After cavity preparation and sealing, the dentin was evaluated clinically (color and consistency) and microbiologically. Dentin samples were cultured on blood agar under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, in Mitis Salivarius agar and Rogosa SL agar. RESULTS: 39 teeth (20 in the CH Group and 19 in the GP Group) were reopened 4-7 months post-treatment for clinical and microbiological evaluation. In all teeth, the initial demineralized dentin was wet and soft or leathery. In the CH Group, 10% of the lesions were yellow, 80% light brown and 10% dark brown and in the GP Group, 94.7% were light brown and 5.3% dark brown. After treatment, the dentin was dry, 90% (Group CH) and 84.2% (Group GP) were dark brown. The final consistency was either leathery or hard. Three samples in the CH Group and five in Group GP changed from soft to leathery; only one sample (GP) remained leathery. 85% in the CH Group and 68.4% in GP Group turned hard after treatment. All bacterial counts decreased significantly by the end of treatment. In the CH Group, the bacterial (Log10 CFU + 1) anaerobic growth decreased from 4.84 +/- 1.31 to 1.35 +/- 1.54, aerobic from 4.09 +/- 1.04 to 0.92 +/- 1.30 and lactobacilli from 3.24 +/- 1.22 to 0.36 +/- 0.89, respectively; the mutans streptococci from 2.05 +/- 1.84 to 0.14 +/- 0.60. In GP Group, anaerobic growth decreased from 5.22 +/- 0.96 to 2.02 +/- 1.65 and aerobic from 4.23 +/- 1.37 to 1.08 +/- 1.29 and lactobacilli from 2.06 +/- 1.81 to 0.00 +/- 0.00, respectively; the mutans streptococci from 3.16 +/- 1.59 to 0.28 +/- 0.84.
TI  - Comparative analysis of a monoclonal antibody-based Streptococcus mutans detection method with selective culture assays using polymerase chain reaction as a gold standard.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare a recently developed monoclonal antibody (MAb)-based salivary Streptococcus mutans detection method with various selective media using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as the gold standard. Salivary S. mutans cells were enumerated with a MAb-based method, along with three commonly used selective media, mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar (MSB), trypticase yeast-extract cystine sucrose bacitracin agar (TYCSB), and glucose-sucrose-potassium tellurite-bacitracin (GSTB) agar. Statistical analysis showed no significant correlations between each method. With PCR as the standard, a MAb-based detection method was found to provide the highest sensitivity (91%) and specificity (96%) among these four methods. This study demonstrates that the MAb-based detection method may provide more accurate enumeration of salivary S. mutans than selective media.
TI  - A modified dip-slide test for microbiological risk in caries assessment.
AB  - This study was undertaken to evaluate the validity of a new modified dip-slide test kit for the estimation of salivary mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and Candida levels by comparison with the results obtained from conventional agar plate counts. Five milliliters of paraffin-stimulated saliva sample was collected from 118 6-12-year old children attending 4 primary schools in Thailand. Saliva was poured over a 3-compartment slide containing Mitis-Salivarius Bacitracin agar, Rogosa agar and Sabouraud dextrose agar. A slide was incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator for 48 hours. The results of the modified test kit were compared with those from the conventional saliva sampling with dilution method. The salivary mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and Candida counts obtained from the conventional methods were significantly correlated (p < 0.0001) with the modified dip-slide estimates of these organisms. (Kendall Tau = 0.71, 0.58 and 0.76, respectively). The correlation between a modified dip-slide test kit and the conventional method indicates that this new test kit is suitable for the screening of salivary mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and Candida levels in patients. The test is simple and would be useful for the early selection of patients for dental examination. In addition, it would be a valuable educational aid for the motivation and dietary counseling among children.
TI  - Calcium modulates interactions between bacteria and hydroxyapatite.
AB  - Bacterial adhesion onto hydroxyapatite is known to depend on the surface properties of both the biomaterial and the bacterial strain, but less is known about the influence of the composition of the aqueous medium. Here, the adhesion of Streptococcus mutans and 3 different Lactobacilli on powdered hydroxyapatite was shown to change with Ca2+ concentration. The effect depends on the surface properties of each strain. Adhesion of Lactobacillus fermentum and salivarius (and of Streptococcus mutans at low Ca2+) was enhanced with increasing Ca2+ concentration. Lactobacillus casei was efficiently removed by adhesion on hydroxyapatite, even without Ca2+ addition, and the effect of this ion was only marginal. The results are interpreted in terms of Ca2+-mediated adhesion, and relative to the hydrophobic properties of each strain and the electrical properties of the bacterial and solid surfaces (electrophoretic mobility).
TI  - Influence of a fluoride mouthrinse on mutans streptococci in schoolchildren.
AB  - This study aimed to determine whether the long-term use of a fluoride mouthrinse  affects the salivary levels of mutans streptococci. Two hundred and fifteen schoolchildren (aged 9-10 years) participated. One hundred and forty-nine of these children had used a fluoride mouthrinse since 5 years of age at nursery school, and the remaining 66 children had not. DFT (decayed and filled teeth) was recorded, and the salivary levels of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus were measured using mitis salivarius bacitracin agar. The group that had used a fluoride mouthrinse had a significantly lower prevalence of both S. mutans and S. sobrinus (p = 0.038) and a significantly lower DFT score (p < 0.001) than the other group. Using logistic regression analysis including caries experience at baseline as a dependent variable, the odds ratio of carrying S. mutans alone was 8.0 (p = 0.066) and that of carrying both S. mutans and S. sobrinus was 16.5 (p = 0.022) in the group that had not used the fluoride mouthrinse. Children carrying both S. mutans and S. sobrinus had a higher caries incidence in 1 year than the others, with odds ratios of 5.73 (p = 0.067) in the group with a fluoride mouthrinse and 3.47 (p = 0.035) in the group without it. These results show that the long-term use of a fluoride mouthrinse is associated with reduced salivary levels of mutans streptococci and this bacterial reduction may partly contribute to the suppression of dental caries in children using a long-term fluoride mouthrinse.
TI  - Tigecycline (GAR-936) activity against Streptococcus gallolyticus (bovis) and viridans group streptococci.
AB  - Viridans group streptococci including Streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly S. bovis) represent serious invasive pathogens often associated with endocarditis or sepsis among immunocompromised or cancer patients. Tigecycline (GAR-936), the first clinically studied glycylcycline, has a potent gram-positive activity with a potential treatment option for these streptococcal infections. The studied collection (848 strains) included 100 isolates each of Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, and fewer strains of S. gallolyticus (98 strains) and Streptococcus mutans (50 strains). These strains were isolated from patients on 3 continents in the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program and tested for susceptibility and interpreted by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute broth microdilution methods and criteria (< or = 0.25 microg/mL for tigecycline per US Food and Drug Administration). Penicillin susceptibility rates for the entire collection varied from 61% (S. sanguis) to 98% (S. constellatus), and macrolide susceptibility was also compromised (49-88%; average, 69%). Tigecycline was active against all isolates tested, in contrast to tetracycline resistance rates of 8-66%, and highest for S. gallolyticus. In conclusion tigecycline was quite active against bacteremic isolates of viridans group streptococci species and S. gallolyticus with an overall MIC90 at < or = 0.06 microg/mL; the highest MIC was only 0.25 microg/mL.
TI  - Comparison of culture media and chairside assays for enumerating mutans streptococci.
AB  - AIM: This study compared several traditional culture-based media and chairside cultural assays for ability to recover mutans streptococci (MS) from pure cultures and from saliva samples. METHODS AND RESULTS: When pure cultures were used with traditional culture-based media, mitis-salivarius bacitracin (MSB) agar demonstrated less support for bacterial recovery than trypticase-yeast extract-cysteine sucrose-bacitracin (TYCSB) agar and the modified medium of Ritz (HLR-S). One species of MS, Streptococcus ferus (c), was not recovered on MSB medium. Chairside cultural tests displayed considerable disparity between tests in recovering bacteria from pure cultures. On the glass adherence assay (Mucount), S. ferus was not detected and Streptococcus criceti was not detected on the dipslide assay (Cariescreen SM) or on the plastic adherence assay (Dentocult SM Strip mutans). The frequency of isolation of pure strains of bacteria other than MS was common. From saliva samples, the frequency of isolation of MS on HLR-S and TYCSB media and the glass adherence assay was 91-97%. The frequency of isolation on MSB medium and on the dip-slide and plastic adherence assays was significantly decreased (37, 47 and 69%, respectively). Recovery scores varied considerably among the culture methods studied and tended to be highest on the HLR-S medium and on the glass adherence assay. CONCLUSIONS: Growth and recovery profiles of pure bacterial cultures and of saliva samples for the MS varied according to different media. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Caution should be exercised in comparing results between studies that employ different cultural methods for MS enumeration.
TI  - A lacticin 3147 enriched food ingredient reduces Streptococcus mutans isolated from the human oral cavity in saliva.
AB  - AIMS: To isolate and characterise Streptococcus mutans from Irish saliva samples  and to assess their sensitivity to a food-grade preparation of the lantibiotic, lacticin 3147, produced by Lactococcus lactis DPC3147. METHODS AND RESULTS: Saliva samples collected from children with varying oral health status were screened on Mitis Salivarius agar for the presence of pathogenic streptococci. Following selective plating, 16S rDNA sequencing and Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE), 15 distinct strains of Strep. mutans were identified. These were grouped according to their relative sensitivity to lacticin 3147 which ranged from 0.78 to 6.25%; relative to a sensitive indicator strain, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis HP. Inhibition of indicator Strep. mutans strains from sensitive, intermediate and tolerant groupings were assessed in microtitre plate assays with increasing concentrations of lacticin 3147. The concentration of lacticin 3147 required to give 50% growth inhibition correlated with their relative sensitivities (as assayed by well diffusion methodology) and ranged from 1280 to 5120 AU ml(-1). Concentrated preparations of lacticin 3147 caused a rapid killing of Strep. mutans strains in broth. Moreover, in human saliva deliberately spiked with Strep. mutans, the pathogen was eliminated (initial inoculum of 10(5)) in the presence of 40,000 AU ml(-1) of lacticin 3147. Furthermore, a food-grade lacticin 3147 spray dried powder ingredient was assessed for the inhibition of Strep. mutans in human saliva, spiked with a strain of intermediate sensitivity, resulting in up to a 4-log reduction in counts after 20 min. CONCLUSION: A food grade preparation of lacticin 3147 was effective in the inhibition of oral Strep. mutans. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The inhibition of oral streptococci by food grade preparations of lacticin 3147 may offer novel opportunities for the development of lacticin 3147 as an anti-cariogenic agent particularly in the area of functional foods for the improvement of oral health.
TI  - Early acquisition of Streptococcus mutans for children.
AB  - Existing evidence reveals that in Early Oral Infection the main route of transmission of Streptococcus mutans is mother-child saliva contacts and that initial acquisition takes place during a specific period of time denominated "Window of Infectivity" that lapses between 6 and 30 months of the child's life, with a higher risk between 18 and 30 months of age. The aim of the present study was to analyze Early Oral Infection. The levels of Streptococcus mutans in saliva and bacterial plaque in the binomial mother-child 6 to 18 months after childbirth were evaluated. Twenty-four mother-child binomials that attended the University Hospital of Maternity and Neonatology of Cordoba participated in the study. Samples of saliva and dental plaque were taken from mother and child and seeded in selective Agar Mitis Salivarius Bacitracin medium (0.28 mg/ml) and cultured for 48 hours at 37 degrees C and in 5% CO2 to allow for the growth of Streptococcus mutans. The colonies were identified morphologically and biochemically. At 6 months after childbirth: 58.33% of the samples of the mother's saliva were positive, while the presence of the microorganism was not detected in 100% of the samples of the infants' saliva. At 18 months of after childbirth: 79.16% of the samples of saliva and 100% of the samples of the mothers' dental plaque were positive, whereas the samples of saliva and dental plaque of the infants were positive for Streptococcus mutans in 20.83% and 70.83% of the cases respectively. The initial acquisition of Streptococcus mutans would have occurred in 20.8% of the children at the age of 18 months. Eruption of primary molars occurs at this age.
TI  - Effects of extracts of miswak and derum on proliferation of Balb/C 3T3 fibroblasts and viability of cariogenic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined the effects of extracts of two chewing sticks on  proliferation of fibroblasts and viability of cariogenic bacteria. METHODS: Aqueous extracts of miswak (Salvadora persica; Arak tree) and derum (Juglans regia; walnut tree) were prepared and their effects investigated on growth of Balb/C 3T3 mouse fibroblasts by measuring the mitochondrial succinic dehydrogenase activity. Furthermore, the effects on the viability of various cariogenic bacteria (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus casei and Actinomyces viscosus) was also determined. RESULTS: The data revealed that Balb/C 3T3 fibroblasts exposed to aqueous extracts of miswak or derum showed an increase in cell proliferation by 156% and 255%, respectively, in comparison with controls (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, extracts from both miswak and derum had adverse effects on the growth of the cariogenic microorganisms, with derum having significantly greater antimicrobial effects than miswak and at much lower concentrations against all the bacteria tested. The most sensitive organisms were A. viscosus, followed by S. mutans, S. salivarius, with L. casei being the most resistant. CONCLUSION: The results show that aqueous extracts of miswak and derum enhance the growth of fibroblasts and inhibit the growth of cariogenic bacteria, with the derum extract showing greater activity than miswak.
TI  - Effects of sonic energy on monospecific biofilms of cariogenic microorganisms.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the in vitro differential effect of sonic energy, delivered  by Sonicare Advance, on cariogenic and non-cariogenic bacteria biofilms. METHODS: A wild strain of Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus salivarius and Veillonella alcalescens was isolated from human dental plaque. For each of the four microorganisms a biofilm adherent to bovine enamel disks, coated with artificial saliva, was obtained. Biofilms were divided into four groups and were exposed to acoustic energy delivered by Sonicare for 0 (control group), 5, 15 and 30 seconds. The distance between the end of the bristles and the disk surface was set to 7 mm, to ensure that the biofilm removal was simply due to fluid forces and not to the contact with the bristle tips during the brushing cycle. A colorimetric technique (MTT assay), based on the reduction of a yellow tetrazolium salt to a purple formazan, was used to evaluate the reduction of the adherent biomass after the exposure to the sonic energy. RESULTS: ANOVA results showed that sonic energy exposure significantly reduced the biomass of S. mutans and S. salivarius adherent to the disks, while L. acidophilus and V. alcalescens seemed to remain basically unaffected. In the two streptococcal groups, the increase of the exposure time led to different reduction trends; while S. salivarius exhibited a progressive decrease over time, S. mutans showed a rapid reduction of the adherent biomass after a 15-second exposure to Sonicare.
TI  - Preparation and antimicrobial activity of gelatin microparticles containing propolis against oral pathogens.
AB  - Gelatin microparticles containing propolis ethanolic extractive solution were prepared by spray-drying technique. Particles with regular morphology, mean diameter ranging of 2.27 microm to 2.48 microm, and good entrapment efficiency for propolis were obtained. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of microparticles was evaluated against microorganisms of oral importance (Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Candida albicans, and Lactobacillus casei). The utilized techniques were diffusion in agar and determination of minimum inhibitory concentration. The choice of the method to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of microparticles showed be very important. The microparticles displayed activity against all tested strains of similar way to the propolis, showing greater activity against the strains of E. salivarius, S. sanguinis, S. mitis, and C. albicans.
TI  - Anticariogenic activity of macelignan isolated from Myristica fragrans (nutmeg) against Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The occurrence of dental caries is mainly associated with oral pathogens, especially cariogenic Streptococcus mutans. Preliminary antibacterial screening revealed that the extract of Myristica fragrans, widely cultivated for the spice and flavor of foods, possessed strong inhibitory activity against S. mutans. The anticariogenic compound was successfully isolated from the methanol extract of M. fragrans by repeated silica gel chromatography, and its structure was identified as macelignan by instrumental analysis using 1D-NMR, 2D-NMR and EI-MS. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of macelignan against S. mutans was 3.9 microg/ml, which was much lower than those of other natural anticariogenic agents such as 15.6 microg/ml of sanguinarine, 250 microg/ml of eucalyptol, 500 microg/ml of menthol and thymol, and 1000 microg/ml of methyl salicylate. Macelignan also possessed preferential activity against other oral microorganisms such as Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei in the MIC range of 2-31.3 microg/ml. In particular, the bactericidal test showed that macelignan, at a concentration of 20 microg/ml, completely inactivated S. mutans in 1 min. The specific activity and fast-effectiveness of macelignan against oral bacteria strongly suggest that it could be employed as a natural antibacterial agent in functional foods or oral care products.
TI  - Mutans streptococci dose response to xylitol chewing gum.
AB  - Xylitol is promoted in caries-preventive strategies, yet its effective dose range is unclear. This study determined the dose-response of mutans streptococci in plaque and unstimulated saliva to xylitol gum. Participants (n = 132) were randomized: controls (G1) (sorbitol/maltitol), or combinations giving xylitol 3.44 g/day (G2), 6.88 g/day (G3), or 10.32 g/day (G4). Groups chewed 3 pellets/4 times/d. Samples were taken at baseline, 5 wks, and 6 mos, and were cultured on modified Mitis Salivarius agar for mutans streptococci and on blood agar for total culturable flora. At 5 wks, mutans streptococci levels in plaque were 10x lower than baseline in G3 and G4 (P = 0.007/0.003). There were no differences in saliva. At 6 mos, mutans streptococci in plaque for G3 and G4 remained 10x lower than baseline (P = 0.007/0.04). Saliva for G3 and G4 was lower than baseline by 8 to 9x (P = 0.011/0.038). Xylitol at 6.44 g/day and 10.32 g/day reduces mutans streptococci in plaque at 5 wks, and in plaque and unstimulated saliva at 6 mos. A plateau effect is suggested between 6.44 g and 10.32 g xylitol/day.
TI  - The ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence.
AB  - Some novel caries detection and excavation devices rely on the ability of bacteria to produce red fluorescing compounds. The aim of this study was to examine the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence. Streptococcus mutans, S. oralis, S. salivarius, S. sobrinus, Lactobacillus fermentans, L. casei, L. rhamnosus, Actinomyces naeslundi, A. israelii, Prevotella intermedia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum were inoculated onto Columbia agar with haemin and vitamin K and incubated anaerobically for up to 7 days in the dark. The resulting bacterial colonies were excited using filtered xenon light (405 +/- 20 nm) and digitally photographed through a 530-nm high-pass filter. The red and green portions of the colony fluorescence were analyzed using a computer program and the red/green ratio was calculated. All colonies emitted both red and green fluorescence. The green outweighed the red portion for the following species (in descending order) S. oralis, S. salivarius, S. mutans, F. nucleatum and S. sobrinus. The red portion was higher for the following species (in descending order) P. intermedia, A. naeslundi, A. israelii, L. fermentans, L. rhamnosus and L. casei. With all the bacteria examined, one color portion generally outweighed the other, giving the visual impression of either red or green fluorescence. We conclude that red fluorescence is well suited to detection of the bacteria which cause dentin caries but it is not suitable as an indicator of the presence and activity of the streptococci involved in initial caries.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial effects of mastic chewing gum against Streptococcus mutans and mutans streptococci.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Dental caries is associated with oral pathogens and Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) is one of the primary cariogenic organisms. Mastic gum, from Pistacia lentiscus, has been shown to have antibacterial properties. The objective of this study was to determine antibacterial activity of mastic chewing gum against S. mutans and mutans streptococci in vitro and in vivo conditions. SETTING: Cukurova University, Dental School, in 2002. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antimicrobial activity of mastic gum was evaluated using standard S. mutans strain by disc diffusion method in vitro. Cytotoxicity effect of mastic gum on HEp-2 cells was evaluated by conventional haemocytometer using the trypan blue exclusion method. Clinical studies were then performed on 25 periodontally healthy volunteers. The inhibitory effect of chewing mastic gum against mutans streptococci in saliva was compared to a placebo gum. Saliva samples were taken from the subjects immediately before and after chewing the mastic gum and the placebo gum for 15 min. Additional saliva samples were collected every 30 min. The samples were inoculated onto mitis salivarius-bacitracin agar and incubated for 48 h anaerobically at 37 degrees C. The total number of viable bacteria was then counted. RESULTS: Among tested solvents (chloroform, acetone, petrolium ether and ethanol), it was found that the acetone was found to be more convenient than the others to dissolve the mastic gum. In the cytotoxicity assay, concentrations up to 75 mg/ml of the mastic gum were not toxic for the replication of HEp-2 cells. Thus, lower concentrations of mastic gum (20 and 50 mg/ml) were used for the experiments. In vitro experiments, the diameters of growth inhibition zones of mastic gum were in the range 9.0-27.0 mm. In the clinical trials, the mean number of bacteria in samples taken after chewing the mastic gum and placebo gum were following; at minute 15 was 112 x 10(4)+/-268 x 10(3) and 175 x 10(4)+/-417 x 10(3)cfu/ml, for minute 45 was 85 x 10(4)+/-219 x 10(3) and 165 x 10(4)+/-329 x 10(3)cfu/ml, at minute 75 was 65 x 10(4)+/-100 x 10(3) and 160 x 10(4)+/-216 x 10(3)cfu/ml, at minute 105 was 60 x 10(4)+/-127 x 10(3) and 150 x 10(4)+/-138 x 10(3)cfu/ml, and at minute 135 was 55 x 10(4)+/-65 x 10(3) and 145 x 10(4)+/-354 x 10(3)cfu/ml, respectively. Significantly fewer bacteria was found in saliva samples collected after chewing mastic gum compared to those after chewing paraffin (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study showed that mastic gum had significant antibacterial activity against S. mutans and mutans streptococci and it may be a useful adjunct in the prevention of caries.
TI  - Cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells by using chitosan-immobilized silica.
AB  - Cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells were conducted by using chitosan-immobilized silica (CIS). When chitosan was immobilized onto silica surfaces with glutaraldehyde, bacterial cells adsorbed well and retained viability. Testing of the adsorption and desorption ability of CIS using various microbes such as Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces ludwigii, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed that most microbes could be adsorbed and selectively desorbed under different conditions. In particular, recovery was improved when L-cysteine was added. A mixture of two bacterial strains adsorbed onto CIS could also be successfully separated by use of specific solutions for each strain. Most of the desorbed cells were alive. Thus, quantitative and selective fractionation of cells is readily achievable by employing chitosan, a known antibacterial material.
TI  - [Comparison of Galla Chinesis and sodium fluoride on growth and metabolism of bacteria in biofilm model].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the antibacterial effect between sodium fluoride and Galla  Chinesis in bioflim model. To evaluate the feasibility of application of Gala Chinesis in the clinical practice of caries prevention. METHODS: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius and Actinomyces naeslundii had been chosen as the experimental bacteria. In the experiment, biofilmn model was constructed, and two agents were added in the media. After a period of continuous culture, the number of bacteria adhering on the HA disc was examed, the planktonic pH in the flow cell was recorded continuously, and the morphology of the biofilmn formed on the HA disc was observed by SEM. RESULTS: (1) Galla Chinesis could inhibit the growth of the four oral bacteria in the biofilm just as sodium fluoride. (2) Galla Chinesis and sodium fluoride could prevent the descent of the planktonic pH in the flow cell, but Galla Chinesis was less efficient than sodium fluoride. (3) The biofilms formed after application of Galla Chinesis and fluoride, but the bacterial cells had less matrix than those applicated with sucrose. CONCLUSION: Galla Chinesis is one kind of effective cariostatic natural agents.
TI  - Cariogenicity of the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus salivarius in rats.
AB  - Probiotic bacteria such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are considered to be non-pathogenic and non-toxigenic on the basis of long years of safe usage. However, some species of lactobacilli are thought to be associated with the development of dental caries. The purpose of the present study was to examine the cariogenicity of the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus salivarius in rats. Rats were divided into six groups, and infected with L. salivarius LS1952R and/or Streptococcus mutans MT8148R. L. salivarius LS1952R became established in the oral cavity of rats and induced significant level of dental caries even when infected for only 5 days from 18 to 22 days of age. In addition, the caries scores of rats superinfected with both Streptococcus mutans MT8148R and L. salivarius LS1952R from 18 days of age were significantly higher than those infected with either L. salivarius LS1952R or S. mutans MT8148R alone. Since strain LS1952R can adhere to saliva-coated hydroxyapatites, it is concluded that L. salivarius strain LS1952R possesses an inherent cariogenic activity following adherence to the tooth surface.
TI  - Oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. However, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. We aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative oral pathogens. METHODS: A total of 238 Lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. In all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis. Antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia was assessed. RESULTS: Lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. The most prevalent strains in healthy persons were Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, Lactobacillus plantarum. Obligately homofermentatives, particularly L. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for L. gasseri, P < 0.01). Sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited S. mutans, 88% A. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% P. gingivalis and 65% P. intermedia. The strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with Lactobacillus paracasei, L. plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus salivarius. The strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against S. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. CONCLUSION: The composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly L. gasseri, in the latter group. Both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.
TI  - In vitro activity of daptomycin against clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - We determined the activity of daptomycin, a recently FDA-approved antimicrobial agent, against clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria, including viridans group streptococci (16 Streptococcus mitis species group, 12 S. mutans species group, 9 S. anginosus species group, 8 S. sanguinis species group, 5 S. salivarius species group) from patients with infective endocarditis, 32 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 32 high-level penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, 38 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (including 1 linezolid-resistant isolate), and the following unusual Gram-positive bacteria: 3 Listeria monocytogenes, 4 Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, 9 Corynebacterium species, 10 Abiotrophia/Granulicatella species, 2 Rothia (Stomatococcus) mucilaginosus, and 4 Gemella morbillorum. Daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)(90) values for the viridans group streptococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, and Enterococcus species were 0.5, 0.5, < or =0.125, and 4 microg/ml, respectively. The daptomycin MIC range for the unusual Gram-positive bacteria was < or =0.125-2 microg/ml. We conclude that daptomycin has in vitro activity against viridans group streptococci associated with endocarditis as well as against several types of unusual Gram-positive bacteria that can cause endocarditis.
TI  - Differentiation of mutans streptococci by intact cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
AB  - It is difficult to distinguish mutans streptococci on the species level, and even more so on the subspecies level. Intact cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) (ICM) was applied to reference strains of five of the species of the mutans group (Streptococcus criceti, Streptococcus downei, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus ratti, Streptococcus sobrinus), nonmutans streptococci (Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus salivarius, and Streptococcus sanguinis), and 177 mutans streptococci isolated from saliva of 10 children. From the analysis of the reference strains, readily distinguishable ICM mass spectra were obtained for the different species. Based on multivariate statistical analysis, a correct and unambiguous assignment was made of the spectra of 159 isolated mutans streptococci to S. mutans and 16 isolates to S. sobrinus. Two isolates were sorted out and were identified by sequencing of their 16S rRNA genes as Streptococcus anginosus. In addition, ICM indicated a misclassification for some reference strains (AHT, V 100 and E 49) and re-classified AHT and E 49 as S. ratti and V 100 as S. sobrinus. This was confirmed by 16S rDNA sequencing. Based on a statistical similarity analysis of the spectra of reference strains and a quantitative assessment of the reproducibility of ICM, the isolates identified as either S. mutans or S. sobrinus were phenotyped on the subspecies level. In the population of the clinical isolates, 14 unambiguously different S. mutans and three different S. sobrinus phenotypes were detected. ICM proved to be a powerful tool for a differentiation of mutans streptococci down to the subspecies level.
TI  - First isolation of Streptococcus downei from human dental plaques.
AB  - In this study, we isolated four bacterial strains grown on mitis-salivarius sucrose bacitracin agar. The strains had similar biochemical characteristics to biotypes I or II of mutans streptococci. The four isolates were identified as Streptococcus downei by 16S rDNA and dextranase gene (dex) sequencing as well as polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) targeting dex. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the isolation and identification of S. downei from dental plaque in humans. The results suggest that S. downei can inhabit the human oral cavity.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of different generation dentin-bonding systems.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the antibacterial activities of different generation dentin-bonding systems. METHOD AND MATERIALS: The antibacterial activities of dentin-bonding systems Optibond FL Primer, Single Bond, Clearfil SE Bond Primer, and Prompt-L-Pop were evaluated against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Cervitec (1% chlorhexidine varnish) was also examined as a positive control material. Disk diffusion tests with filter paper disks (n = 10) containing a drop of each material (20 microL) were used. After incubation at 37 degrees C for 48 hours, the growth inhibition zones were measured in millimeters. RESULTS: Of all the materials tested, Optibond FL Primer, Clearfil SE Bond Primer, and Prompt-LPop showed larger growth inhibition zones than the control material for all bacterial strains. No antibacterial effect was noted for Single Bond. The results indicated that Optibond FL Primer had the strongest effect against the S mutans and L casei, and Clearfil SE Bond Primer produced the largest inhibition zone for S salivarius and L acidophilus among the test materials. CONCLUSION: The antibacterial effects observed for the tested different generation dentin-bonding systems may be related to the acidic nature of the materials.
TI  - Susceptibilities of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to antibacterial peptides, {beta}-defensins and LL37, produced by human epithelial cells.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial peptides are one of the factors involved in innate immunity. The susceptibility of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to the major antimicrobial peptides produced by epithelia was investigated. METHODS: Synthetic antimicrobial peptides of human beta-defensin-1 (hBD1), hBD2, hBD3 and LL37 (CAP18) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against oral bacteria. They included Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (20 strains), Porphyromonas gingivalis (6), Prevotella intermedia (7), Fusobacterium nucleatum (7), Streptococcus mutans (5), Streptococcus sobrinus (5), Streptococcus salivarius (5), Streptococcus sanguis (4), Streptococcus mitis (2) and Lactobacillus casei (1). RESULTS: Although the four peptides had bactericidal activity against all bacteria tested, the degree of antibacterial activity was variable against the different strains and species. The antibacterial activity of hBD1 was lower than that of the other peptides. Among the bacteria tested in this study, F. nucleatum was highly susceptible to hBD3 and LL37, and S. mutans was highly susceptible to hBD3. We measured the Zeta-potential, representing the net charge of whole bacteria, to study the relationship between susceptibility to cationic peptide and the net charge of the bacteria. Although we found some correlation in A. actinomycetemcomitans strains, we did not find a definite correlation with all the bacterial species. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that beta-defensins and LL37 have versatile antibacterial activity against oral bacteria.
TI  - Identification of non-mutans streptococci organisms in dental plaques recovering  on mitis-salivarius bacitracin agar medium.
AB  - The objective of this study was to both isolate and identify non-mutans streptococci organisms (non-MSO) from dental plaques recovered on mitis-salivarius sucrose bacitracin agar (MSB) plates. The dental plaque samples, which had been collected from 63 human subjects, were diluted and plated on MSB. The bacteria growing on the MSB plates were then identified with biochemical tests, as well as with 16S rDNA cloning and sequencing techniques. Our data indicated that bacteria from 30 subjects had been recovered on the MSB plates. Among the 21 typical colonies selected from the 30 subjects, 12 colonies, derived from 10 subjects, were identified as non-MSO. These 12 colonies were determined to be Streptococcus anginosus (8 colonies), S. sanguinis (1 colony), and Pantoea agglomerans (3 colonies). These results strongly suggest that a new selective medium will be required for the reliable isolation of mutans streptococci.
TI  - LuxS-based signaling affects Streptococcus mutans biofilm formation.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans is implicated as a major etiological agent in human dental caries, and one of the important virulence properties of this organism is its ability to form biofilms (dental plaque) on tooth surfaces. We examined the role of autoinducer-2 (AI-2) on S. mutans biofilm formation by constructing a GS-5 luxS-null mutant. Biofilm formation by the luxS mutant in 0.5% sucrose defined medium was found to be markedly attenuated compared to the wild type. Scanning electron microscopy also revealed that biofilms of the luxS mutant formed larger clumps in sucrose medium compared to the parental strain. Therefore, the expression of glucosyltransferase genes was examined and the gtfB and gtfC genes, but not the gtfD gene, in the luxS mutant were upregulated in the mid-log growth phase. Furthermore, we developed a novel two-compartment system to monitor AI-2 production by oral streptococci and periodontopathic bacteria. The biofilm defect of the luxS mutant was complemented by strains of S. gordonii, S. sobrinus, and S. anginosus; however, it was not complemented by S. oralis, S. salivarius, or S. sanguinis. Biofilm formation by the luxS mutant was also complemented by Porphyromonas gingivalis 381 and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4 but not by a P. gingivalis luxS mutant. These results suggest that the regulation of the glucosyltransferase genes required for sucrose-dependent biofilm formation is regulated by AI-2. Furthermore, these results provide further confirmation of previous proposals that quorum sensing via AI-2 may play a significant role in oral biofilm formation.
TI  - Identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by an oligonucleotide array.
AB  - Viridans streptococci (VS) are common etiologic agents of subacute infective endocarditis and are capable of causing a variety of pyogenic infections. Many species of VS are difficult to differentiate by phenotypic traits. An oligonucleotide array based on 16S-23S rRNA gene intergenic spacer (ITS) sequences was developed to identify 11 clinically relevant VS. These 11 species were Streptococcus anginosus, S. constellatus, S. gordonii, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis, and S. uberis. The method consisted of PCR amplification of the ITS regions by using a pair of universal primers, followed by hybridization of the digoxigenin-labeled PCR products to a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides immobilized on a nylon membrane. After 120 strains of the 11 species of VG and 91 strains of other bacteria were tested, the sensitivity and specificity of the oligonucleotide array were found to be 100% (120 of 120 strains) and 95.6% (87 of 91 strains), respectively. S. pneumoniae cross-hybridized to the probes used for the identification of S. mitis, and simple biochemical tests such as optochin susceptibility or bile solubility should be used to differentiate S. pneumoniae from S. mitis. In conclusion, identification of species of VS by use of the present oligonucleotide array is accurate and could be used as an alternative reliable method for species identification of strains of VS.
TI  - [The effect of galla chinensis on the growth of cariogenic bacteria in vitro].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purples of this study was to investigate the role of different components of Galla Chinensis extract on the growth of 6 kinds of cariogenic bacteria, and to find out the most effective components of Galla Chinensis extract. METHODS: Four different components (GCE1, GCE2, GCE3 and GCE4) were separated from Galla Chinensis and there antibacterial activities to Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556, Streptococcus salivarius SS 196, Actinomyces naeslundii WVU 627, Actinomyces viscosus ATCC 19246 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus AC 413 were checked. There effects on the growth curve of Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175 were also investigated. RESULTS: The most effective part of Galla Chinensis was found to be GCE2 and GCE4, which were found to be a mixture of polyphenol-rich fractions. All of the different components had an inhibitory effect to the growth of Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175. CONCLUSION: All of the 4 different components of Galla Chinensis extract could inhibit the growth of the tested bacteria. These results suggest that the antibacterial activity of Galla Chinensis extract is caused by a synergistic effect of monomeric polyphenols, which can easily bind to proteins.
TI  - Growth-inhibitory effect of antibacterial self-etching primer on mutans streptococci obtained from arrested carious lesions.
AB  - BACKGROUND: An antibacterial self-etching primer has been developed to inhibit bacterial attachment and plaque accumulation on the tooth surfaces. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the growth-inhibitory effect of an antibacterial self-etching primer on mutans streptococci obtained from arrested carious lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Softened dentin specimens were obtained from arrested carious lesions with an excavator or a round steel bur. The effect of a commercial antibacterial self-etching primer and a commercial self-etching primer on the total streptococci on Mitis-Salivarius (MS) agar plates and on Streptococcus mutans on MS agar plates containing 0.02 M bacitracin (MSB) was evaluated. Specimens with no primer were used as controls. The number of colonies of both total streptococci and S. mutans were compared statistically with two-way analysis of variance and Fisher's Protected Least Squares Differences (PLSD) test (p < .05). RESULTS: The number of colonies of total streptococci (CFU/mL) for the two methods (excavator and round steel bur) were as follows: for the control, 5.0 x 10(6) and 5.0 x 10(6); for the self-etching primer, 1.0 x 10(5) and 1.0 x 10(5); and for the antibacterial self-etching primer, 0 and 0. The number of colonies of S. mutans for the two methods (excavator and round steel bur) were as follows: for the control, 5.0 x 10(6) and 1.8 x 10(5); for the self-etching primer, 3.5 x 10(4) and 5.0 x 10(3); and for the antibacterial self-etching primer, 0 and 0. Regardless of the method of softened dentin removal, the antibacterial effect was significantly higher for the group that had antibacterial self-etching primer compared with that of the control group and the group that had commercial self-etching primer (p < .05). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The antibacterial self-etching primer showed a high level of antibacterial activity against mutans streptococci obtained from the arrested carious lesions.
TI  - The microflora of the erupting first permanent molar.
AB  - The relationship between microflora, eruption status and caries status in the first permanent molar of young children was investigated in 177 children aged 6-7 years. A significantly greater proportion of fully erupted teeth were classified as sound and plaque-free compared to partially erupted teeth. Fully erupted teeth yielded greater numbers and proportions of mutans streptococci compared with significantly greater numbers and proportions of Actinomyces israelii in partially erupted teeth. Logistical regression analysis showed significant associations between white spot lesions in partially erupted teeth and increased numbers of Streptococcus oralis, mutans streptococci and Streptococcus salivarius whereas the presence of Actinomyces naeslundii was associated with health. Significantly greater numbers and proportions of S. oralis and S. salivarius were isolated from partially erupted teeth with white spot lesions whereas Streptococcus mutans was isolated in significantly greater numbers and proportions from fully erupted molars with white spots. This study suggests that organisms other than mutans streptococci are associated with caries development in erupting permanent molar teeth.
TI  - Zymographic characterization of bacteriolytic enzymes produced by oral streptococci.
AB  - Zymographic analysis was performed to know the bacteriolytic enzyme profiles of 4% SDS extracts of oral streptococci, Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, S. sanguis, S. mitis and S. salivarius. We investigated the five strains in each species and found that the profile was very similar among strains of the same species except for S. salivarius(the profile was classified into two types). On the other hand, the profile was considerably different among species. Two major bacteriolytic enzymes of S. mutans showing molecular mass of 80 and 100 kDa were found using SDS-boiled S. mutans or S. sobrinus cells as substrate. These bacteriolytic activities were less apparent in the gel containing S. mitis or S. salivarius, and also not detectable in the gel containing S. sanguis. S. sobrinus extract showed only one bacteriolytic band (78 kDa) as strong activity using S. sobrinus cells as substrate. S. sanguis extract showed no bacteriolytic bands using any streptococcal cells. Extracts of either S. mitis or S. salivarius showed weak activity by using respective strains as substrate.
TI  - [Analysis of oral microflora early colonized in infants].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the dynamic changes of oral microflora early colonized in infants. METHODS: The oral swab samples for the study were taken in 1 day, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 months after birth from 12 healthy neonates. By choosing suitable diluted concentration, the samples were incubated aerobically, facultative anaerobically and anaerobically. The strains were identified by observing colony characteristics, Gram staining and biochemical tests. RESULTS: S. salivarius was the most frequent microflora, followed by S. mitis, S. sanguis, S. gordonii and S. mutans occurred in oral cavity after tooth eruption. Veillonella spp. can be detected in oral cavity of 1-month-old babies, A. odontolyticus was isolated from 8.3% infants of more than 3 months old. L. acidophilus maintained the lower prevalence in oral cavity of babies. Leptotrichia buccalis and Capnocytophaga spp. occurred in oral cavity of some dentate infants. CONCLUSION: S. solivarius and S. mitis are predominant species in oral cavity of the infants, Veillonella spp. is the first and the most anaerobic species appeared in oral cavity of healthy babies. A. odontolyticus is the first actinomyces detected in oral cavity. With the increasing months, kind and amount of microflora increase dramatically.
TI  - Identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci by sequence analysis of the 16S-23S ribosomal DNA spacer region.
AB  - The feasibility of sequence analysis of the 16S-23S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) intergenic spacer (ITS) for the identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci (VS) was evaluated. The ITS regions of 29 reference strains (11 species) of VS were amplified by PCR and sequenced. These 11 species were Streptococcus anginosus, S. constellatus, S. gordonii, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis, and S. uberis. The ITS lengths (246 to 391 bp) and sequences were highly conserved among strains within a species. The intraspecies similarity scores for the ITS sequences ranged from 0.98 to 1.0, except for the score for S. gordonii strains. The interspecies similarity scores for the ITS sequences varied from 0.31 to 0.93. Phylogenetic analysis of the ITS regions revealed that evolution of the regions of some species of VS is not parallel to that of the 16S rRNA genes. One hundred six clinical isolates of VS were identified by the Rapid ID 32 STREP system (bioMerieux Vitek, Marcy l'Etoile, France) and by ITS sequencing, and the level of disagreement between the two methods was 18% (19 isolates). Most isolates producing discrepant results could be unambiguously assigned to a specific species by their ITS sequences. The accuracy of using ITS sequencing for identification of VS was verified by 16S rDNA sequencing for all strains except strains of S. oralis and S. mitis, which were difficult to differentiate by their 16S rDNA sequences. In conclusion, identification of species of VS by ITS sequencing is reliable and could be used as an alternative accurate method for identification of VS.
TI  - The bacteriology of the supragingival plaque of child dental patients in Kuwait.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the bacterial flora of the gingival plaques of pediatric dental patients in order to establish baseline data for future studies on the complex microbiota of the oral cavity of this group of child dental patients. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Forty subjects, aged 3-12 years, were enrolled and investigated after informed consent was obtained. During the patients' first visit to the dental clinic supragingival plaque samples were collected from the gingival area of buccal and lingual tooth surfaces of all primary and permanent molar teeth using sterile curettes. Serially diluted samples were inoculated onto a set of selective and nonselective media and then incubated at the appropriate atmospheric conditions and temperatures. Representative colonies of isolates were identified by standard methods, including hemolytic characteristics on blood agar and profiling on API 20S and API 20A as appropriate. RESULTS: A total of 183 isolates (123 aerobes and 60 anaerobes) were recovered from the 40 patients with a mean count of 3 per sample of aerobes compared to 1.5 per sample for the anaerobes. Streptococcus sanguis was the predominant aerobic species (23.6%) isolated from 29 (72.5%) of the 40 patients, followed by Streptococcus mitis, 19.5 and 60%, Streptococcus salivarius, 17.1 and 52.5% and Streptococcus mutans, 17.1 and 52.5%. The frequency of isolation of anaerobic bacteria was Prevotella spp. 50% from 30 (75%) of the 40 patients, Fusobacterium spp., 18.3 and 27.5%, Bacteroides spp., Porphyromonas spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp., 6.7 and 10%, 6.7 and 10%, and 5 and 7.5%, respectively. Prevotella intermedia was the single most common species. CONCLUSION: The results show that there were more aerobic/facultative anaerobic bacteria than the obligate anaerobes in the dental plaque of the pediatric dental patients in Kuwait. The high prevalence of the pioneering streptococci as well as black-pigmented Prevotella spp. and Fusobacterium spp. indicates that the dental plaques of the children were in the developing stage, a precursor to the development of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Effect of composite resin biodegradation products on oral streptococcal growth.
AB  - Hydrolytic degradation by-products associated with the constitutive monomers 2,2-bis [4-(2-hydroxy-3-methacryloxypropoxy) phenyl] propane (bis-GMA), bisphenol A polyethylene glycol diether dimethacrylate (bis-EMA), and triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEDGMA) used in dental restorative composites include bis-hydroxy-propoxyphenyl propane (bis-HPPP), ethoxylated bisphenol A (E-bisPA), methacrylic acid (MA), and triethylene glycol (TEG). These products are generated from the interaction of human salivary esterases with the composites. Recent findings have indicated that TEGDMA has the ability to modulate oral bacteria but it is unclear which components of TEGDMA are related to the observed effects. The objective of the current study was to investigate the influence of TEGDMA derived degradation products MA and TEG on the growth of three strains of oral bacteria: S. mutans strains NG8 and JH1005, and S. salivarius AT2. Bacterial growth rates were measured at 37 degrees C, and pH values of 5.5 (representative of cariogenic state) or 7.0 at concentrations of 0-50mmol/l for MA (Sigma, US) and 0-100mmol/l for TEG (Sigma, US). It was found that at pH 5.5 TEG significantly stimulated the growth of both S. mutans strains ( p<0.05 ) in the concentration range of 0.5-10.0mmol/l and stimulated the growth of S. salivarius AT2 for the entire concentration range tested (p<0.05). TEG (above 50mmol/1) did not significantly affect the doubling times of S. salivarius at pH of 7.0 and it inhibited the growth of both S. mutans strains above 50mmol/l at the same pH value. At pH 5.5 MA inhibited the growth of all three strains with increasing concentration. At neutral pH, the growth of S. mutans NG8 strain was significantly reduced by MA ( p<0.05 ) above 10mmol/l. In summary, these results indicate that TEG and MA modulate the growth rate of important oral bacteria in a concentration and pH dependent manner.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of silver inorganic agent YDA filler.
AB  - YDA filler is an antibacterial agent that is currently in commercial dental use.  In this study, we attempted to determine whether it exerts an antibacterial effect on human saliva bacteria, and to determine whether it can be used in dental materials. CFUs in 1 mL stimulated human saliva were examined using blood agar and mitis salivarius agar after immersion, with or without YDA filler. The antibacterial effect was compared with that of Ketac-Silver. Dental materials containing 5% wt YDA filler were prepared for in vitro testing on S. mutans and A. viscosus. Furthermore, we examined the in vitro cytotoxicity of experimental MMA resin containing YDA filler on HeLa cells. Human saliva bacteria and mutans streptococci showed reduced viability following exposure to YDA filler after 12 h. The concentration of silver ions released by YDA filler was below 1 ppm after 12 h. Two tested strains showed reduced viability following exposure to dental materials containing YDA filler. In another experiment, MMA resin containing YDA filler did not show cytotoxicity on HeLa cells after 24- and 48-h exposure. Thus, YDA filler may help in the development of antibacterial dental materials, such as composite resin, glass-ionomer or temporary cement.
TI  - Isopanduratin A from Kaempferia pandurata as an active antibacterial agent against cariogenic Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - An antibacterial compound active against Streptococcus mutans was isolated from Kaempferia pandurata and identified as isopanduratin A using 1H NMR, 13C NMR and EI-MS. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of isopanduratin A was 4 mg/l which was much lower than that of some other natural anticariogenic agents such as sanguinarine (12 mg/l), green tea extract and carvacrol (125 mg/l), thymol (250 mg/l) and isoeugenol and eucalyptol (500 mg/l). The bactericidal test showed that isopanduratin A completely inactivated S. mutans at 20 mg/l in 1 min. Significant inhibitory activity of isopanduratin A was also observed against S. sobrinus, S. sanguinis and S. salivarius with an MIC of 4 mg/l. Damage to the cell membrane and cell wall of S. mutans by isopanduratin A was shown using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These results suggest that isopanduratin A could be employed as a potential antibacterial agent for preventing dental caries.
TI  - Modifications of hydrophobicity, in vitro adherence and cellular aggregation of Streptococcus mutans by Helichrysum italicum extract.
AB  - AIMS: The purpose of the present study was to examine whether sublethal concentrations of Helichrysum italicum extract could affect some of the cariogenic properties of Streptococcus mutans. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied the antibacterial activity of H. italicum (ethanolic extract) against oral streptococci (Strep. mutans ATCC 35668, Strep. salivarius ATCC 13419 and Strep. sanguis ATCC 10556) and its influence on cell-surface hydrophobicity, in vitro sucrose-dependent adherence to glass surface and cellular aggregation of Strep. mutans. The results indicate that all streptococci were susceptible to ethanolic extract with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 31.25-62.50 microg x ml(-1). Sub-MIC concentrations of H. italicum (7.81-31.25 microg x ml(-1)) reduced the hydrophobicity and the adherence (almost 90%) to glass surface of Strep. mutans. The aggregation in the presence of dextran T2000 was also affected. CONCLUSION: The inhibitory activity of H. italicum extract on Strep. mutans is worthy of further study. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: There is considerable interest in the use of natural compounds as alternative methods to control undesirable micro-organisms.
TI  - PCR detection and identification of oral streptococci in saliva samples using gtf genes.
AB  - Oral streptococci are major constituents of dental plaque, and their prevalence is implicated in various pathologies. Therefore, accurate identification of oral streptococci would be valuable for studies of cariogenic plaque and for diagnostic use in infective endocarditis. Many oral streptococci possess glucosyltransferase enzymes that synthesize glucan, which is an obligate component of dental plaque. We established a rapid and precise method to identify oral streptococci by PCR using the species-specific region from the glucosyltransferase gene. With the species-specific primers, Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis, S. oralis, and S. gordonii could be successfully distinguished. Further, we developed a simple method to extract the bacterial DNA from saliva. Using the resultant DNA as a template, the proposed PCR detection was performed. Their distribution was in accord with results of conventional biochemical tests. These findings indicate that the present PCR method is useful for the analysis of oral streptococci and can be successfully used in clinical applications to identify pathogenic bacteria associated with oral infectious disease and/or endocarditis.
TI  - Physiologic actions of zinc related to inhibition of acid and alkali production by oral streptococci in suspensions and biofilms.
AB  - Zinc is a known inhibitor of acid production by mutans streptococci. Our primary  objective was to extend current knowledge of the physiologic bases for this inhibition and also for zinc inhibition of alkali production by Streptococcus rattus FA-1 and Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419. Zinc at concentrations as low as 0.01-0.1 mm not only inhibited acid production by cells of Streptococcus mutans GS-5 in suspensions or in biofilms but also sensitized glycolysis by intact cells to acidification. Zinc reversibly inhibited the F-ATPase of permeabilized cells of S. mutans with a 50% inhibitory concentration of about 1 mm for cells in suspensions. Zinc reversibly inhibited the phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system with 50% inhibition at about 0.3 mm ZnSO4, or about half that concentration when the zinc-citrate chelate was used. The reversibility of these inhibitory actions of zinc correlates with findings that it is mainly bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal. Zinc inhibited alkali production from arginine or urea and was a potent enzyme inhibitor for arginine deiminase of S. rattus FA-1 and for urease of S. salivarius. In addition, zinc citrate at high levels of 10-20 mm was weakly bactericidal.
TI  - Susceptibility of oral bacteria to an antimicrobial decapeptide.
AB  - Naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides have emerged as alternative classes of antimicrobials. In general, these antimicrobial peptides exhibit selectivity for prokaryotes and minimize the problems of engendering microbial resistance. As an alternative method to search for more effective broad-spectrum peptide antimicrobials, investigators have developed peptide libraries by using synthetic combinatorial technology. A novel decapeptide, KKVVFKVKFK (KSL), has been identified that shows a broad range of antibacterial activity. The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of this antimicrobial peptide in killing selected strains of oral pathogens and resident saliva bacteria collected from human subjects. Cytotoxic activity of KSL against mammalian cells and the structural features of this decapeptide were also investigated, the latter by using two-dimensional NMR in aqueous and DMSO solutions. MICs of KSL for the majority of oral bacteria tested in vitro ranged from 3 to 100 microg ml(-1). Minimal bactericidal concentrations of KSL were, in general, within one to two dilutions of the MICs. KSL exhibited an ED(99) (the dose at which 99 % killing was observed after 15 min at 37 degrees C) of 6.25 microg ml(-1) against selected strains of Lactobacillus salivarius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus gordonii and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. In addition, KSL damaged bacterial cell membranes and caused 1.05 log units reduction of viability counts of saliva bacteria. In vitro toxicity studies showed that KSL, at concentrations up to 1 mg ml(-1), did not induce cell death or compromise the membrane integrity of human gingival fibroblasts. NMR studies suggest that KSL adopts an alpha-helical structure in DMSO solution, which mimics the polar aprotic membrane environment, whereas it remains unstructured in aqueous medium. This study shows that KSL may be a useful antimicrobial agent for inhibiting the growth of oral bacteria that are associated with caries development and early plaque formation.
TI  - The acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  - The intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. Plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. In addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to pH 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. The results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at pH 5.5 and 1% at pH 5.0, pH values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. At pH 5.0, members of the genus Streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. The other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus gordinii, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus salivarius and SStreptococcus sanguis. Analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.
TI  - [Effects of topical application of immunoglobulin yolk on mutans streptococci in  dental plaque].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the inhibitory effects of topical application of specific  immunoglobulin yolk antibodies (IgY) to mutans streptococci on composition of human dental plaque. METHODS: A total of 24 healthy adult volunteers were selected and randomly distributed into three experimental groups. After a supragingival scaling, the subjects were treated with an application of IgY containing spray (test group, n = 9), a 0.15% chlorhexidine(CH) spray(positive control group, n = 9) or a placebo phosphate buffered saline(PBS) spray without any active ingredients(negative control group, n = 6) three times daily for three weeks. Pooled plaque samples from the smooth surfaces of teeth were collected for microbiologic analysis before administration (baseline, day 0), during treatment(days 7, 14 and 21) and after withdrawal of the agents(days 28, 42 and 56) and plaque index were recorded. Microbial cultivation were performed by serially diluting the samples with PBS solution an cultivating the aliquots on mitis salivarius agar(MS) and MS supplemented with bacitracin (MSB) for oral streptococci and mutans streptococci respectively. The number of colony-forming unit (CFU) per plate was counted and the percentage of mutans streptococci per oral streptococci in dental plaque were determined. The effect of IgY on colonization of mutans streptococci were analyzed by an analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: The plaque indexes remained unchanged, but mutans streptococci in dental plaque was suppressed significantly following a short term(three weeks) application of IgY, and low level of mutans streptococci persisted for at least 5 weeks after withdrawal of IgY. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the immunization with specific immunoglobulin yolk against mutans streptococci could be useful for long term suppression of mutans streptococci colonization in human dental plaque.
TI  - Identification of mutans streptococci by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified 16S ribosomal RNA genes.
AB  - Mutans streptococci are frequently isolated from dental plaque and carious lesions. These bacteria have been identified by conventional methods such as biochemical and serologic tests followed by the isolation of colonies on the mitis-salivarius agar, which are sometimes inconsistent. Recently, species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been reported to rapidly identify Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus. However, in the case of identification and classification into several species, e.g. within the group of mutans streptococci consisting of seven species, the identification using species-specific PCR seems somewhat inefficient because of need for the development and preparation of specific primers for each species. Therefore, in this study we developed a simple method using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of PCR-amplified 16S ribosomal RNA genes (16S rRNA genes PCR-RFLP) for the identification of seven different species included in the group of mutans streptococci. We amplified 16S rRNA gene sequences from genomic DNA samples by PCR using universal primers and digested the PCR products with the restriction endonucleases, HpaII and HaeIII. HpaII produced six RFLP patterns for eight reference strains, since the patterns for S. sobrinus, Streptococcus downei and Streptococcus ferus were similar. RFLP patterns produced with HaeIII could separate these three species. Furthermore, the RFLP patterns predicted from the 16S rRNA gene sequences in the GenBank database agreed with the actual RFLP patterns produced in the present study. The 16S rRNA sequence comparisons can be used to identify oral mutans streptococci; however, the identification by sequencing is sometimes difficult in large-scale studies and for small laboratories. Therefore, 16S rRNA genes PCR-RFLP, using HpaII and HaeIII, could be an alternative method for the identification of mutans streptococci, and may be applicable for large-scale studies on the cariogenicity of mutans streptococci.
TI  - Non-mutans streptococci in patients receiving radiotherapy in the head and neck area.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study mutans and non-mutans streptococci in patients after radiotherapy of the head and neck. METHODS: Oral rinse samples collected from nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients before and after radiotherapy were diluted and cultured on nonselective and selective media for enumeration of total cultivable plaque flora, mutans and non-mutans streptococci and lactobacilli. Non-mutans streptococci were identified biochemically and by 16S rDNA sequence homology analysis. RESULTS: After irradiation, mutans streptococci were not isolated; the levels of Streptococcus mitis and lactobacilli increased significantly. The level of Streptococcus salivarius increased, but the significance was the borderline. The level of Streptococcus sanguis decreased significantly after irradiation. The abundance of other oral streptococci species showed no significant changes. CONCLUSIONS: S. mitis and S. salivarius are the predominant non-mutans streptococci in the high-caries-risk oral flora following radiotherapy.
TI  - Evaluation of clinical and microbiological features of deep carious lesions in primary molars.
AB  - PURPOSE: Concern about the survival of microorganisms in deep carious lesions may often lead to unnecessary exposure of the pulp during excavation. This study evaluated the relationship between microbiological and clinical results of deep carious lesions in primary molars. METHODS: Clinical evaluation was performed on 72 deep carious lesions considered to have pulp perforation after traditional excavation. The dentin color and consistency were assessed by means of standardized scales using the technique of Bjorndal et al before restoration. For microbiological examination, dentin samples were taken by a sterile bur and transferred to transport fluid, then plated on tryptic soy agar for growth of total colony forming units. Samples werethen transferred on Rogosa SL agar for growth of oral lactobacilli and on mitis salivarius agar for growth of mutans streptococci. RESULTS: The proportion of mutans streptococci, lactobacilli, and total colony forming units increased when the dentin color and consistency increased. However, the proportion of lactobacilli was smaller than that of mutans streptococci in carious dentin samples. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to expectations, the findings showed that the number of bacteria in carious dentin of primary molars was not significantly excessive.
TI  - Classification of oral streptococci by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with direct activity stain for glycosyltransferases.
AB  - Thirty eight strains of oral streptococci were divided into six types by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) followed by glycosyltransferase (GLT) activity stain: Type 1, Streptococcus mutans; Type 2, Streptococcus rattus; Type 3, Streptococcus sobrinus and Streptococcus downei; Type 4, Streptococcus cricetus; Type 5, Streptococcus salivarius; and Type 6, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus gordonii. In Types 1, 2 and 5, two glucosyltransferases synthesizing water-insoluble (GTF-I) and water-soluble glucans (GTF-S) and a fructosyltransferase (FTF) were detected. In Types 3 and 4, GTF-I and two GTF-Ss were detected. Only one GTF-S was detected in Type 6. The 2-DE patterns for these six types were clearly distinguished from each other based on the kind, number and location of GLTs in gel.
TI  - Bacterial replacement therapy: adapting 'germ warfare' to infection prevention.
AB  - The individual bacterial members of our indigeneous microbiota are actively engaged in an on-going battle to prevent colonisation and overgrowth of their terrain by competing microbes, some of which might have pathogenic potential for the host. Humans have long attempted to intervene in these bacterial interactions. Ingestion of probiotic bacteria, particularly lactobacilli, is commonly practiced to promote well-balanced intestinal microflora. As bacterial resistance to antimicrobials has increased, so too has research into colonisation of human tissues with specific effector strains capable of out-competing known bacterial pathogens. Recent progress is particularly evident in the application of avirulent Streptococcus mutans to the control of dental caries, alpha hemolytic streptococci to reduction of otitis media recurrences and Streptococcus salivarius to streptococcal pharyngitis prevention.
TI  - Invasion and killing of human endothelial cells by viridans group streptococci.
AB  - Colonization of the cardiovascular endothelium by viridans group streptococci can result in infective endocarditis and possibly atherosclerosis; however, the mechanisms of pathogenesis are poorly understood. We investigated the ability of selected oral streptococci to infect monolayers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in 50% human plasma and to produce cytotoxicity. Planktonic Streptococcus gordonii CH1 killed HUVEC over a 5-h period by peroxidogenesis (alpha-hemolysin) and by acidogenesis but not by production of protein exotoxins. HUVEC were protected fully by addition of supplemental buffers and bovine liver catalase to the culture medium. Streptococci were also found to invade HUVEC by an endocytic mechanism that was dependent on polymerization of actin microfilaments and on a functional cytoskeleton, as indicated by inhibition with cytochalasin D and nocodazole. Electron microscopy revealed streptococci attached to HUVEC surfaces via numerous fibrillar structures and bacteria in membrane-encased cytoplasmic vacuoles. Following invasion by S. gordonii CH1, HUVEC monolayers showed 63% cell lysis over 4 h, releasing 64% of the total intracellular bacteria into the culture medium; however, the bacteria did not multiply during this time. The ability to invade HUVEC was exhibited by selected strains of S. gordonii, S. sanguis, S. mutans, S. mitis, and S. oralis but only weakly by S. salivarius. Comparison of isogenic pairs of S. gordonii revealed a requirement for several surface proteins for maximum host cell invasion: glucosyltransferase, the sialic acid-binding protein Hsa, and the hydrophobicity/coaggregation proteins CshA and CshB. Deletion of genes for the antigen I/II adhesins, SspA and SspB, did not affect invasion. We hypothesize that peroxidogenesis and invasion of the cardiovascular endothelium by viridans group streptococci are integral events in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis and atherosclerosis.
TI  - In vitro testing of xylitol as an anticariogenic agent.
AB  - A number of studies involving xylitol chewing gum have demonstrated that xylitol  is both noncariogenic and anticariogenic. The ability of xylitol to act as an anticariogenic agent most likely is due to its ability to be transported into caries-causing oral bacteria and inhibiting fermentation either by depleting the cell of high-energy phosphate or by poisoning the glycolytic system. In vitro tests were conducted to determine the concentration of xylitol required to inhibit the growth of three strains of oral streptococcus (S. mutans, S. salivarius, and S. sanguis). All three strains were inhibited significantly at xylitol concentrations of 12.5% and higher; however, only S. mutans was inhibited significantly at a xylitol concentration of 1.56%.
TI  - Comparison of different techniques of quantitative PCR for determination of Streptococcus mutans counts in saliva samples.
AB  - Saliva samples from 16 children with current caries activity were investigated for Streptococcus mutans using three different PCR techniques, and the results were compared with those of selective cultivation on mitis salivarius agar with bacitracin (MSB) (I, II: LightCycler - competitive PCR end-point analysis; III: LightCycler - kinetic real-time analysis; IV, V: block cycler - competitive PCR end-point analysis; VI: cultivation on MSB agar). In groups I, III, IV and VI the saliva samples were analyzed directly. A DNA preparation before PCR with added competitors was carried out in groups II and V to exclude the influence of PCR inhibitors. The coefficients of correlation ranged from 0.97 to 0.98 among the competitive PCR methods, 0.8 to 0.85 for competitive vs. real-time PCR and 0.5 to 0.65 for PCR vs. cultivation methods. Competitive PCR on the real-time instrument was found to be more rapid than, comparably sensitive to, but less reproducible than competitive PCR on a block cycler.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of garlic, tea tree oil, and chlorhexidine against oral microorganisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the antimicrobial activity of tea tree oil, garlic, and chlorhexidine solutions against oral microorganisms. METHOD: The five-week study consisted of thirty subjects. The first week was considered baseline. All subjects used a control solution (second week), and were randomly divided into the three groups (third week): G1-0.12% chlorhexidine; G2 - 2.5% garlic (Allium sativum, L.); and G3 - 0.2% tea tree oil (Melaleuca alternifolia). Dishes containing blood agar and Mitis Salivarius Bacitracin agar (MSB) were inoculated with the subjects' saliva (collected twice a week). Total microorganisms and mutans streptococci were counted in blood agar and MSB, respectively. RESULTS: Chlorhexidine and garlic groups showed antimicrobial activity against mutans streptococci, but not against other oral microorganisms. The tea tree oil group showed antimicrobial activity against mutans streptococci and other oral microorganisms. Maintenance of reduced levels of microorganisms was observed only for garlic and tea tree oil during the two consecutive weeks (fourth and fifth). Unpleasant taste (chlorhexidine 40%, tea tree oil 30%, garlic 100%), burning sensation (chlorhexidine 40%, tea tree oil 60%, garlic 100%), bad breath (chlorhexidine 40%, tea tree oil 20%, garlic 90%), and nausea (chlorhexidine 0%, tea tree oil 10%, garlic 30%) were reported. CONCLUSION: Garlic and tea tree oil might be an alternative to chlorhexidine.
TI  - Longitudinal study of the influence of removable partial denture and chemical control on the levels of Streptococcus mutans in saliva.
AB  - Some studies have evaluated the salivary levels of mutans streptococci (MS) in removable partial denture (RPD) users. Saliva samples (2.0 mL) were obtained from 31 patients in six periods: (T0): immediately before installation of RPD; (T8): 8 days after T0; (T48): 48 days after T0; (T92): 92 days after T0; (T140): 140 days after T0 and (T189): 189 days after T0. The samples were vortexed and serially diluted from 10(-1) to 10(-6) in 0.05 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). From each dilution, 0.025 mL was plated on Mitis Salivarius Bacitracin (MSB). The plates were incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 degrees C for 72 h. There was an increase (t-test, P < 0.05) in the number of MS between periods T0 and T48 (mean/s.d., CFU mL(-1) of saliva): T0: 2.26/4.43 x 10(6) and T48: 0.47/1.48 x 10(8). After this, intensive treatment with CHX was accomplished in 29 patients. Saliva samples were obtained after treatment in four periods: (T24 h): 24 h after T0; (T14): 14 days after T24 h; (T28): 28 days after T24 h, and (T63): 63 days after T24 h. The number of MS in saliva did not decrease (t-test, P > 0.05). A new CHX formulation was applied in 15 patients. Saliva samples were obtained in periods: (T0): before new CHX application; (T24 h): 24 h after T0 and (T82): 82 days after T0. The new CHX reduced MS levels in saliva: (mean/s.d., CFU mL(-1) of saliva): T0: 6.64/8.47 x 10(6) and T24 h: 3.2/4.27 x 10(5) (sign rank, P < 0.05). In conclusion, there was a significant increase in the number of MS in saliva after the installation of RPD. The intensive treatment with a properly formulated CHX was effective in the reduction of MS, between 24 h and 82 days after its application.
TI  - Bacteriophage isolation from human saliva.
AB  - AIMS: To detect bacteriophages for Gram-positive oral pathogens in human saliva.  METHODS AND RESULTS: Saliva samples from 31 donors were screened for the presence of bacteriophages for Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Actinomyces viscosus and Enterococcus faecalis. Bacteriophages for Enterococcus faecalis were found in seven samples. Enterococcus faecalis phages were still present in saliva re-collected from one donor one month, and one year after initial saliva collection. CONCLUSIONS: The presence and stability of the Enterococcus faecalis bacteriophages in human saliva suggests a possible role of these bacteriophages in the oral ecosystem. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Phage therapy as a way to control oral bacteria might be considered.
TI  - Correlations between bacterial levels in autologous subgingival plaque and saliva of adult Sudanese.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess levels of oral bacteria and their correlations in paired samples of saliva and subgingival plaque in a population of adult Sudanese. Whole saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples from six probing sites of one tooth in each jaw were obtained from 56 Sudanese adults (mean age 35.2+/-8.9 years). Levels of 24 oral bacteria in the autologous saliva and pooled plaque sample of each subject were assessed by DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. There were significantly ( P< or =0.01) higher percentages of subjects with > or =10(5) bacterial cells of Prevotella intermedia, Campylobacter rectus, Veillonella parvula, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus salivarius, and Leptotrichia buccalis and significantly ( P< or =0.01) lower percentages with Treponema denticola in saliva than in subgingival plaque. The detection frequencies at > or =10(6) bacterial cells were significantly higher for Selenomonas sputigena, S. anginosus, Streptococcus sanguis, and S. salivarius and significantly lower for Porphyromonas gingivalis in saliva than in subgingival plaque ( P< or =0.01). Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, S. sputigena, S. sanguis, and Streptococcus mitis demonstrated significant ( P< or =0.05) positive correlations between their levels in plaque and saliva. This study indicates that the levels of P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, S. sanguis, and S. mitis correlate significantly in saliva and subgingival plaque and that higher accuracy of detection and assessment of the levels of these bacteria in the oral cavity may be achieved by concurrent sampling of saliva and subgingival plaque.
TI  - Inhibition by yeast killer toxin-like antibodies of oral Streptococci adhesion to tooth surfaces in an ex vivo model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Monoclonal (KTmAb) and recombinant (KTscFv) anti-idiotypic antibodies, representing the internal image of a yeast killer toxin, proved to be microbicidal in vitro against important eukaryotic and prokaryotic pathogens such as Candida albicans, Pneumocystis carinii, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, including multidrug-resistant strains. KTmAb and KTscFv exerted a strong therapeutic effect in well-established animal models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis. Streptococcus mutans is the most important etiologic agent of dental caries that might result from the metabolic end products of dental plaque. Effective strategies to reduce the disease potential of dental plaque have considered the possibility of using antibiotics or antibodies against oral streptococci in general and S. mutans in particular. In this study, the activity of KTmAb and KTscFv against S. mutans and the inhibition and reduction by KTmAb of dental colonization by S. mutans and other oral streptococci in an ex vivo model of human teeth were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: KTscFv and KTmAb were used in a conventional colony forming unit (CFU) assay against a serotype C strain of S. mutans, and other oral streptococci (S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. oralis, S. salivarius). An ex vivo model of human teeth submerged in saliva was used to establish KTmAb potential of inhibiting or reducing the adhesion to dental surfaces by S. mutans and other oral streptococci. RESULTS: KTmAb and KTscFv kill in vitro S. mutans and other oral streptococci. KTmAb inhibit colonization of dental surfaces by S. mutans and oral streptococci in the ex vivo model. CONCLUSIONS: Killer antibodies with antibiotic activity or their engineered derivatives may have a potential in the prevention of dental caries in vivo.
TI  - groESL sequence determination, phylogenetic analysis, and species differentiation for viridans group streptococci.
AB  - The full-length sequences of the groESL genes (also known as cpn10/60) of Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus sanguis and the near full-length sequence of the groESL genes of Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus salivarius were determined. The lengths of the groES genes from the 10 species listed above ranged from 282 to 288 bp, and the full-length sequences of groEL determined for 4 species (S. anginosus, S. constellatus, S. gordonii, and S. sanguis) revealed that each was 1,623 bp. The intergenic region (spacer) between the groES and groEL genes varies in size (15 to 111 bp) and sequence between species. The variation of the groES sequences among the species tested was greater (62.1 to 95.1% nucleotide sequence identities) than that of the groEL sequences (77.2 to 95.2% nucleotide sequence identities). Phylogenetic analysis of the groES and groEL genes yielded evolutionary trees similar to the tree constructed by use of the 16S rRNA gene. The intraspecies variation of the spacer was minimal for clinical isolates of some species. The groESL sequence data provide an additional parameter for identification of viridans group streptococcal species.
TI  - [Evaluation of surface disinfectants utilized in dentistry].
AB  - Surface disinfection is a procedure carried out on the external parts of the dental equipment as well as on other items of the dental office. The aim of this study was to analyze the efficacy of 4 surface disinfectants utilized in dentistry: 77 degrees GL alcohol, phenolic compound (Duplofen), iodophor (PVP-I) and 77 degrees GL alcohol with 5% of chlorhexidine. Four surfaces of the equipment were analyzed in the study (the carter, the washbasin for hand-washing, the headrest of the chair and the external surface of the reflector), and the spray-wipe-spray procedure was carried out. From each surface, samples were collected by means of surface plates containing Mitis Salivarius bacitracin sucrose agar, Sabouraud Dextrose agar with chloramphenicol, MacConkey agar and blood agar, for counting mutans streptococci, Candida yeasts, gram-negative bacteria and total microorganisms, respectively (ufc/plate). The results were statistically analyzed by means of the Student's t test in order to compare the mean ufc/plate values. The most effective disinfectant was 77 degrees GL alcohol with 5% of chlorhexidine, mainly against gram-positive bacteria. Iodophor and phenolic compound were also effective in microbial reduction. 77 degrees GL alcohol was the least effective product - however, although it is not considered as a surface disinfectant, it produced, in this study, statistically significant microbial reduction after the disinfecting procedure.
TI  - Intracellular and extracellular pHs of Streptococcus mutans after addition of acids: loading and efflux of a fluorescent pH indicator in streptococcal cells.
AB  - A pH-sensitive fluorescent dye, 2', 7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5 and 6-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF), was used to determine intracellular pH (pH(in)). The efflux of BCECF loaded into oral streptococcal cells was determined after incubation of the cells at 35 degrees C for 20 min in the presence and absence of glucose. In the absence of glucose, the fluorescence of intracellular BCECF in Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus sobrinus decreased only very slightly, indicating that the dye could be useful for pH(in) determination. In the presence of glucose, however, the fluorescence decreased by 57%. Thus, the pH(in) of S. mutans cells was measured by the BCECF method in the absence of glucose at various acidic pH levels by adding lactic, acetic and hydrochloric acids to the cell suspensions. The pH(in) was almost equal to the extracellular pH (pH(out)) for pH(out) values of between 8 and 5, indicating that protons permeated easily across the S. mutans cell membrane. For pH(out) between 5 and 4, pH(in) was constant at around 5, suggesting that the cell membrane was impermeable to protons, or that a cytoplasmic buffering system functioned. pH(in) decreased at pH(out) values of < 4. The constant pH(in) at acidic pH(out) levels could protect intracellular components, such as proteins, against acidification by sugar fermentation.
TI  - Susceptibility of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus to cell wall inhibitors and development of a novel selective medium for S. sobrinus.
AB  - Representative strains of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus showed  differences in susceptibility to members of the monobactam group of beta-lactam antibiotics: S. sobrinus was less sensitive than S. mutans. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of aztreonam (AZT) and carumonam, both of which belong to this group, were 2,000 microg/ml for S. sobrinus and 125 microg/ml for S. mutans. Further addition of fosfomycin, bacitracin and sodium chloride to Mitis Salivarius agar (MS) supplemented with AZT resulted in growth inhibition of S. mutans and oral streptococci other than S. sobrinus, and was therefore used as a selective medium for S. sobrinus (MS-SOB medium). The average growth recovery of laboratory and clinically isolated strains of S. sobrinus on MS-SOB medium was 74.1% compared to that on MS medium. Seventy-eight percent of clinical samples in which S. sobrinus was detected yielded pure growth of S. sobrinus on MS-SOB medium.
TI  - Salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in Sudanese adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult Sudanese subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. The periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. Whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method using whole genomic DNA probes. RESULTS: A high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or = 105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. Between 12% and 16% of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, C. rectus and E. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum, respectively. There were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. Presence of > or = 105 L. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). There were significantly higher levels of A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, C. rectus, P. micros, V. parvula, S. mutans, S. anginosus, A. israelii, C. sputigena, and C. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, E. corrodens, L. acidophilus, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. oralis, and S. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. CONCLUSIONS: : The findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. This is the first report that the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.
TI  - Comparison of five selective media for the growth and enumeration of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although a few growth media are available for selective isolation of  the cariogenic bacteria, Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), it is still unclear as to which is the most efficacious. This study compared the selectivity and sensitivity of five different media for growing a laboratory strain of S. mutans (NCTC 10449), and for enumerating S. mutans from teeth of a group of young children, aged 2-10 years. METHODS: The media tested in this study were mitis salivarius with bacitracin (MSB), mitis salivariuskanamycin-bacitracin (MSKB), glucose-sucrose-tellurite-bacitracin (GSTB), trypticase soy-sucrose-bacitracin (TYS20B) and tryptone-yeast-cysteine-sucrose-bacitracin (TYCSB) agars. These were prepared according to the respective manufacturer's instructions. RESULTS: The results showed that at concentrations of bacteria 1 x 10(3) to 1 x 10(10)/mL, the recovery of the laboratory S. mutans strain was highest in TYCSB agar, followed by in descending order by TYS20B, MSB, GSTB, and MSKB (p<0.01). Similar results were obtained using dental plaque samples collected from swabs of the teeth of a group of children. In the clinical samples, TYCSB again showed the highest recovery rates of S. mutans compared to the other four media. Results were reproduced at dilutions of the samples at 1:20 x 10(6) to 1:2 x 10(6), and S. mutans concentrations of 1.6 to 7.7 Log 10 CFU/mL. In addition, there were highest ratios of mutans to non-mutans bacteria in TYCSB compared to the other media, suggesting high selectivity of this media for mutans species. CONCLUSION: The results of our study suggest that TYCSB is the most sensitive and selective media for culture of S. mutans for laboratory and clinical studies.
TI  - An essential amino acid residue for catalytic activity of the dextranase of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Dextranase (Dex) is an enzyme that hydrolyzes glucan, a polymer of glucose synthesized from sucrose by glucosyltransferases (GTFs). By comparing amino acid sequences of Dexs and GTFs, we found that the Dex enzymes of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus downei and Streptococcus salivarius had similar amino acid sequences to those of the catalytic sites of GTFs of mutans streptococci. We therefore examined the amino acid essential in Dex catalysis by molecular genetic approaches in this study. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to convert the Asp-385 of the Dex molecule of S. mutans Ingbritt to Glu, Asn, Thr or Val. Replacement of Asp-385 with any of the amino acids resulted in complete disappearance of Dex activity. However, replacement of other Asp residues did not affect the enzyme activity. The inactive enzymes still retained dextran-binding ability. These results suggest that Asp-385 of the Dex of S. mutans Ingbritt was essential for enzyme activity and the catalytic and substrate-binding sites were located at different sites within the Dex molecule.
TI  - A clinical, microbiologic, and radiographic study of deep caries lesions after incomplete caries removal.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Clinical, radiographic, and microbiologic changes in deep caries lesions were assessed after incomplete carious dentin removal and tooth sealing. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Thirty-two teeth with deep caries lesions were studied. Treatment consisted of incomplete excavation of the demineralized dentin, application of calcium hydroxide, and sealing for a 6- to 7-month period. The color and consistency of the dentin were clinically assessed. Differences in radiographic density were assessed by digital image subtraction. Microbiologic samples were obtained from the demineralized dentin before the temporary sealing and after the experimental period. The samples were cultivated on blood agar under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, in Mitis Salivarius agar, and Rogosa selective Lactobacillus agar. RESULTS: Two cases were lost during the study; one presented pulpal necrosis. In the other case, there was pulpal exposure during removal of provisional sealing. In all teeth, the initial demineralized dentin was soft and wet; one lesion was yellow, 21 were light brown, and eight were dark brown. After treatment, the dentin was dry, and 80.00% of specimens were hard, 16.67% were leathery, and 3.33% remained soft. The dentin was light brown in five teeth and dark brown in 25. There was a statistically significant mean difference in radiographic density (pixel intensity), 88.77 +/- 7.02 in the control areas and 94.66 +/- 6.75 in the test areas. The counts of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria, lactobacilli, and Streptococci mutans had decreased significantly by the end of treatment. CONCLUSION: Incomplete removal of carious dentin and subsequent tooth sealing resulted in the arrest of the lesions, suggesting that complete dentinal caries lesion removal is not essential to the control of caries lesions.
TI  - Molecular analysis of bacterial species associated with childhood caries.
AB  - Although substantial epidemiologic evidence links Streptococcus mutans to caries, the pathobiology of caries may involve more complex communities of bacterial species. Molecular methods for bacterial identification and enumeration now make it possible to more precisely study the microbiota associated with dental caries. The purpose of this study was to compare the bacteria found in early childhood caries (ECC) to those found in caries-free children by using molecular identification methods. Cloning and sequencing of bacterial 16S ribosomal DNAs from a healthy subject and a subject with ECC were used for identification of novel species or uncultivated phylotypes and species not previously associated with dental caries. Ten novel phylotypes were identified. A number of species or phylotypes that may play a role in health or disease were identified and warrant further investigation. In addition, quantitative measurements for 23 previously known bacterial species or species groups were obtained by a reverse capture checkerboard assay for 30 subjects with caries and 30 healthy controls. Significant differences were observed for nine species: S. sanguinis was associated with health and, in order of decreasing cell numbers, Actinomyces gerencseriae, Bifidobacterium, S. mutans, Veillonella, S. salivarius, S. constellatus, S. parasanguinis, and Lactobacillus fermentum were associated with caries. These data suggest that A. gerencseriae and other Actinomyces species may play an important role in caries initiation and that a novel Bifidobacterium may be a major pathogen in deep caries. Further investigation could lead to the identification of targets for biological interventions in the caries process and thereby contribute to improved prevention of and treatment for this significant public health problem.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of ZnCl(2) on glycolysis in human oral microbes.
AB  - Although the inhibition of bacterial glycolysis by zinc ions might be expected to moderate dental caries, there has not been a comparison of the effect of Zn on different organisms under both fixed pH and free-fall conditions. Here, the effect of ZnCl(2) on Streptococcus salivarius, Strep. mutans, Strep. sobrinus, Actinomyces naeslundii and Lactobacillus casei, as well as on mixtures of oral organisms outgrown from human dental plaque and saliva, was surveyed. pH-stat experiments were performed at pH 7, 6 or 5 in a solution containing 5% glucose and a suspension of the test organism; pH-fall experiments started at pH 7. In both cases, acid production was monitored for 60 min, when samples were taken for Zn and lactate determinations. Under pH-stat conditions, acid production was inhibited by Zn most strongly in Strep. sobrinus and Strep. salivarius. In terms of total acid production averted, however, the effect of Zn under both pH-stat and pH-fall conditions was clearly greatest with Strep. salivarius. A. naeslundii was inhibited the least strongly under pH-stat conditions. Cultured oral organism mixtures were more sensitive to moderate concentrations of zinc (0.2-0.3mM initial concentration) than were the single species to higher concentrations (1mM). Packed cell layers responded to Zn quite differently from suspensions, the pH often falling in the presence of 1mM Zn at a rate similar to the no Zn control. As streptococci had the highest acidogenesis rates in both pH-stat and pH-fall experiments, it seems likely that inhibition of acid production with these organisms would be of more value in moderating caries than the inhibition of less acidogenic organisms such as A. naeslundii.
TI  - Vaccination with FimA from Streptococcus parasanguis protects rats from endocarditis caused by other viridans streptococci.
AB  - The FimA protein of Streptococcus parasanguis is a virulence factor in the rat model of endocarditis, and immunization with FimA protects rats against homologous bacterial challenge. Because FimA-like proteins are widespread among the oral streptococci, the leading cause of native valve endocarditis, we evaluated the ability of this vaccinogen to protect rats when challenged by other streptococcal species. Here we report that FimA vaccination produced antibodies that cross-reacted with and protected against challenge by the oral streptococci S. mitis, S. mutans, and S. salivarius. FimA thus has promise as a vaccinogen to control infective endocarditis caused by oral streptococci.
TI  - [Typing of Streptococcus mutans (serotype C) by arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between genetic diversity within Streptococcus mutans (C), and dental caries. METHODS: One reference strain (GS5) was used to establish the suitability of primers and the initial AP-PCR conditions. Isolates of Streptococcus mutans (C) were obtained from 19 caries-free and 40 caries-active patients, and were originally isolated on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. Totally 278 isolates were biochemically and serologically confirmed as Streptococcus mutans (C). Chromosomal DNA was extracted from those isolates by Chelex. One random primer, OPA-05 was used as a template in PCR reaction. All amplification reactions were conducted in a volume of 20 microliters containing 2 microliters of 10 x reaction buffer, 200 mumol/L each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase. We varied the concentrations of MgCl2 (1.5-4.5 mmol/L), template DNA (2-40 ng), and primer (0.3-0.5 mumol/L) to determine the optical conditions for AP-PCR. The temperature profile in a thermocycler was 35 cycles as follows: 94 degrees C for 1 min, at 36 degrees C for 2 min, at 72 degrees C for 2 min. The initial denaturation was at 94 degrees C for 5 min and the final extension at 72 degrees C for 5 min. RESULTS: The MgCl2 concentration in 4 mmol/L and the primer concentration in 0.5 mumol/L produced clearly distinct and reproducible fingerprints. We found 105 different patterns among the 278 isolates. In high-caries persons more than one genotype isolates of Streptococcus mutans (C) were colonized. CONCLUSIONS: Isolates of Streptococcus mutans (C) exist apparent genetic diversity. The genotypes of isolates might relate to differences in caries susceptibility.
TI  - Retention of oral microorganisms on conventional and resin-modified glass-ionomer cements.
AB  - Secondary caries are a worldwide public and socioeconomic problem. The placement  of restorations can lead to the development of environmental conditions favorable to microbial colonization, especially on the tooth/restoration interface, which is a predisposing factor for secondary caries. The aim of this study was to evaluate microbial retention on conventional (Chelon-Fil and Vidrion R) and resin-modified (Vitremer and Fuji II LC) glass-ionomer cements, in situ, using a hybrid composite resin (Z100) as a control. Twelve volunteers wore Hawley appliances with specimens made of all tested filling materials for 7 days. The specimens were then removed from the appliances and transferred to tubes containing 2.0 ml of Ringer-PRAS. Microorganisms from the samples were inoculated onto blood agar and Mitis Salivarius Bacitracin agar and incubated under anaerobiosis (90% N2, 10% CO2), at 37 degrees C, for 10 and 2 days, respectively. The resin-modified glass-ionomer cements and the composite resin retained the same levels of microorganisms on their surfaces. The resin-modified glass-ionomers retained less mutans streptococci than the composite resin and conventional glass-ionomer cements. The conventional glass-ionomer cements retained less mutans streptococci than the composite resin, but that difference was not statistically significant.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
AB  - Bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of Psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to China with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. In this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. The cell growth of Streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of S. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. The bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on S. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); pH, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). Bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including S. mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sobrinus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Actinomyces viscosus, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, with MICs ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. Furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of S. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of pH in the broth. Thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.
TI  - Alteration of the coadherence of Candida albicans with oral bacteria by dietary sugars.
AB  - Interactions between bacterial oral flora and Candida albicans are important in denture plaque formation. This study therefore first aimed to quantify the coadherence of C. albicans and bacteria by the use of a bioluminescent adenosine triphosphate (ATP) assay based on the firefly luciferase-luciferin system. The second aim was to examine the effect of i) dietary sugars (used for preculture) and ii) enzymatic digestion of fungi on the coadherence. When yeast was preincubated in yeast nitrogen base medium (YNB) supplemented with 250 mM glucose, the yeast coadhered with all isolates of Streptoccus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis, and no significant coadhesion was observed with the isolates of Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus and Actinomyces. However, when the yeast was precultured in YNB supplemented with 500 mM galactose, the yeast coadhered with S. salivarius and Actinomyces, which was not observed when the yeast was grown in YNB with glucose. In addition, the coadherence of the yeast with the isolates of S. sanguis was significantly reduced. Enzymatic digestion of yeast and a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay revealed that expression of at least two types of proteinaceous adhesins are involved in these phenomena.
TI  - Bactericidal and cytotoxic effects of sodium hypochlorite and sodium dichloroisocyanurate solutions in vitro.
AB  - The antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) were evaluated and compared in vitro. The minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration of NaOCl and NaDCC were tested for Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus mutans. The cytotoxic effect was assessed by using human fibroblast tissue culture. Survival rate was assessed by a protein determination method. Results showed that the minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration values of NaOCl and NaDCC for the tested bacteria were in a similar range. NaDCC in concentrations higher than 0.02%, and NaOCl in concentrations higher than 0.01% were lethal to fibroblasts. In conclusion it seems that both agents were very effective in killing bacteria, and their cytotoxicity to fibroblasts in tissue culture was similar.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and molecular characterization of a dextranase gene from Streptococcus downei.
AB  - DNA fragments encoding the Streptococcus downei dextranase were amplified by PCR  and inverse PCR based on a comparison of the dextranase gene (dex) sequences from S. sobrinus, S. mutans, and S. salivarius, and the complete nucleotide sequence of the S. downei dex was determined. An open reading frame (ORF) of dex was 3,891 bp long. It encoded a dextranase protein (Dex) consisting of 1,297 amino acids with a molecular mass of 139,743 Da and an isoelectric point of 4.49. The deduced amino acid sequence of S. downei Dex had homology to those of S. sobrinus, S. mutans and S. salivanus Dex in the conserved region (made of about 540 amino acid residues). DNA hybridization analysis showed that a dex DNA probe of S. downei hybridized to the chromosomal DNA of S. sobrinus as well as that of S. downei, but did not to other species of mutans streptococci. The C terminus of the S. downei Dex had a membrane-anchor region which has been reported as a common structure of C termini of both the S. mutans and S. sobrinus Dex. The recombinant plasmid which harbored the dex ORF of S. downei produced a recombinant Dex enzyme in Escherichia coli cells. The analysis of the recombinant enzyme on SDS-PAGE containing blue dextran showed multiple active forms as well as dextranases of S. mutans, S. sobrinus and S. salivarius.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of MoAbs against a surface protein antigen in real-time adherence in vitro and recolonization in vivo of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - A surface protein antigen (PAc) of Streptococcus mutans, particularly the A-region of the molecule, has been reported to interact with salivary components on the tooth surface. It might be a candidate antigen inducing the production of antibodies against the adherence of S. mutans to the tooth surface. We investigated the effects of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) obtained by immunization of synthetic PAc peptides that completely correspond to the amino acid sequence of part of the A-region. These MoAbs recognize several core B-cell epitopes in the sequence. Two (KH5 and SH2) of these antibodies reacted with both S. mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus, but not with Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Porphyromonas gingivalis or Lactobacillus casei. They clearly inhibited the real-time adherence of S. mutans to salivary components in a biosensor. KH5, which showed a real-time inhibition (71%), also significantly prevented the recolonization of S. mutans on the tooth surface in rats. These results suggested that the core B-cell epitope (-Y---L--Y----) recognized by KH5 was the essential sequence in the antigenic epitopes of PAc protein recognized specifically by the inhibitory antibody. Therefore, the amino acid residues were found to be important in the initial attachment of S. mutans to the tooth surface. These results provide for the mechanism of PAc molecule in the initial attachment of S. mutans on the tooth surface and more effective designs for the removal of S. mutans and S. sobrinus from the oral cavity.
TI  - Lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
AB  - Samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for Lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. Yeasts (20.1%), Streptococcus spp. (8.7%), Staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. The Lactobacillus isolates were L. brevis (24.6%) L. fermentum (18.5%) L. casei (16.9%), L. delbrueckii (15.4%), L. plantarum (9.23%), L. acidophilus (7.69%), L. jensenii (4.62%), L. salivarius (1.54%) and L. gasseri (1.54%). The most common species was L. brevis (24.6%). The strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. All the Lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella dysenteriae, S. sonnei, Klebsiella spp. and Campylobacter sp. All the lactobacilli except L. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. The involvement of Lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. The ability of Lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.
TI  - Influence of maternal xylitol consumption on mother-child transmission of mutans  streptococci: 6-year follow-up.
AB  - Xylitol is effective as a noncariogenic or even cariostatic sugar substitute. Habitual xylitol consumption appears to select for mutans streptococci (MS) which shed easily into saliva from plaque. We have earlier shown that habitual xylitol consumption of mothers was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the probability of mother-child transmission of MS assessed at 2 years of age. The aim of the present study was to assess the children's MS counts 1 and 4 years after the maternal xylitol consumption had been discontinued. At baseline, during pregnancy, all mothers (n = 195) showed high salivary levels of MS. The mothers were randomly assigned to xylitol, fluoride (F) and chlorhexidine (CHX) groups. In the xylitol group, the mothers chewed xylitol-sweetened gum, for 21 months, starting 3 months after delivery. In the two control groups, the mothers received CHX or F varnish treatments at 6, 12 and 18 months after delivery. At the 2-year examination, 169 mother-child pairs participated. At the 3-year and 6-year examinations, there were 159 and 147 children in the study, respectively. For children's MS analyses, visible plaque was collected using toothpicks at the age of 3 and paraffin-stimulated saliva at the age of 6. The persons involved in the collection and analysis of the microbiological samples were blinded as to the study design and group. Both the plaque and salivary MS were cultured on Mitis salivarius agars containing bacitracin. In all groups, the colonization percentages increased during the follow-up. At the 3-year examination, the children's risk of having MS colonization was 2.3-fold in the F group (95% CI 1.3-4.2) compared to the xylitol group. This difference was statistically significant. Even at 6 years of age, the salivary MS levels were significantly lower in the xylitol group than in the other groups (ANOVA, p<0.001). In conclusion, the earlier demonstrated, xylitol-associated reduction in the probability of mother-child transmission of MS was still found in the children's MS counts at the age of 3 and 6 years.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of dentin bonding systems, polyacid-modified composite resins and composite resins.
AB  - This study examined the antibacterial activities of the bonding systems Syntac, EBS and Scotchbond 1, the polyacid-modified composite resins Hytac and Compoglass, and the composite resins Tetric, Z100 and Scalp-it. They were evaluated using the cariogenic bacteria Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus salivarius, Streptococcus sorbinus and Actinomyces viscosus in vitro with a modified cylinder drop plate agar diffusion assay. All adhesives of the dentin bonding systems and the polyacid-modified composite resins exhibited various degrees of antibacterial activity against all of the test bacteria. On the contrary, composite resins did not affect bacterial growth. The data suggest that the use of these adhesives and polyacid-modified composite resins may reduce the consequences of microleakage owing to their antibacterial properties.
TI  - Oral colonization and cariogenicity of Streptococcus gordonii in specific pathogen-free TAN:SPFOM(OM)BR rats consuming starch or sucrose diets.
AB  - The significance of Streptococcus gordonii in dental caries is undefined, as is that of other alpha-amylase-binding bacteria (ABB) commonly found in the mouth. To clarify the ecological and cariological roles of S. gordonii our specific pathogen-free Osborne-Mendel rats, TAN:SPFOM(OM)BR, were fed either diet 2000 (containing 56% confectioner's sugar, most of which is sucrose) or diet 2000CS (containing 56% cornstarch, in lieu of confectioner's sugar) and inoculated with S. gordonii strains. Uninoculated rats were free of both indigenous mutans streptococci (MS) and ABB, including S. gordonii, as shown by culture on mitis salivarius and blood agars of swabs and sonicates of dentitions after weanlings had consumed these diets for 26 days. ABB were detected by radiochemical assay using [125I]-amylase reactive to alpha-amylase-binding protein characteristic of the surface of S. gordonii and other ABB. No ABB were detected (detection limit < 1 colony-forming units in 10(6) colony-forming units). Thus the TAN:SPFOM(OM)BR colony presents a 'clean animal model' for subsequent study. Consequently, S. gordonii strains Challis or G9B were used to inoculate weanling rat groups consuming either the high-sucrose diet 2000 or the cornstarch diet 2000CS. Two additional groups fed each of these diets remained unioculated. Recoveries of inoculants were tested 12 and 26 days later by oral swabs and sonication of the molars of one hemimandible of each animal, respectively. Uninoculated animals were reconfirmed to be free of ABB and mutans streptococci, but inoculated ones eating diet 2000CS had S. gordonii recoveries of 1-10% or, if eating diet 2000, 10-30% of total colony-farming units in sonicates. There were no statistically significant differences among the inoculated and uninoculated animal groups' caries scores when they ate the cornstarch diet. Lesion scores for sucrose-eating rats were, however, from 2.4-5.1-fold higher than for cornstarch-eating rats, P < 0.001, and were still higher if animals had been inoculated with either Challis (1.41-fold) or G9B (1.64-fold), than if uninoculated, both P < 0.001, so long as the rats ate the sucrose diet. Therefore, TAN:SPFOM(OM)BR rats do not harbour ABB or S. gordonii but can be colonized by S. gordonii. Colonization levels of S. gordonii on the teeth are higher in the presence of high sucrose than with high starch-containing diets. Caries scores are augmented by sucrose compared with starch, and are further augmented by S gordonii colonization. S. gordonii is thus cariologically significant in the presence of sucrose, at least in this rat.
TI  - Mannosidase production by viridans group streptococci.
AB  - The production of mannosidase activity by all currently recognized species of human viridans group streptococci was determined using an assay in which bacterial growth was dependent on the degradation of the high-mannose-type glycans of RNase B and subsequent utilization of released mannose. RNase B is an excellent substrate for the demonstration of mannosidase activity since it is a glycoprotein with a single glycosylation site which is occupied by high-mannose-type glycoforms containing five to nine mannose residues. Mannosidase activity was produced only by some members of the mitis group (Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus infantis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) and Streptococcus intermedius of the anginosus group. None of the other species within the salivarius and mutans groups or Streptococcus peroris and Streptococcus sanguinis produced mannosidase activity. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, it was demonstrated that the Man(5) glycan alone was degraded while Man(6) to Man(9), which contain terminal alpha(1-->2) mannose residues in addition to the alpha(1-->3), alpha(1-->6), and beta(1-->4) residues present in Man(5), remained intact. Investigations on mannosidase production using synthetic (4-methylumbelliferone- or p-nitrophenol-linked) alpha- or beta-mannosides as substrates indicated that there was no correlation between degradation of these substrates and degradation of the Man(5) glycan of RNase B. No species degraded these alpha-linked mannosides, while degradation of the beta-linked synthetic substrates was restricted to strains within the Streptococcus anginosus, S. gordonii, and S. intermedius species. The data generated using a native glycoprotein as the substrate demonstrate that mannosidase production within the viridans group streptococci is more widely distributed than had previously been considered.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria from healthy oral cavity of Thai volunteers: inhibition of oral pathogens.
AB  - The aims of the present study were to screen and characterize the antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria which were isolated from healthy oral cavities of Thai volunteers, and to characterize their inhibiting substances. Among 3790 isolates (suspected to be lactic acid bacteria) from 130 volunteers, five showed an appreciable effect against Sarcina lutea ATCC 9341, Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Streptococcus mutans DTMU 1, Strep. salivarius DTMU 1, Strep. sanguis DTMU 1, Candida albicans ATCC 13803 and C. albicans DTMU 2, as well as the oral pathogens. These antimicrobial isolates included L17 and N14 which showed the antibacterial activity, D14 which showed the anticandidal activity, and D6 and N8 which showed both the antibacterial and anticandidal activities. The isolates were later found to be facultative anaerobic, Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-capsule-forming and catalase-negative bacilli. They could utilize casein but could not hydrolyse starch, and they produced hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins. Their antimicrobial potentials were found to be affected by pH, catalase, proteolytic enzymes and temperature. The activity was partially inactivated after catalase treatment, significantly declined at pH > or =9.0 or after trypsin and pepsin treatments, and also reduced after heating at > or =100 degrees C. However, the antimicrobial activity of these five isolates was somewhat resistant to heat. When the isolates were tested for their antimicrobial sensitivity, they were shown to be sensitive to a number of antimicrobial agents. The final identification revealed that D6, D14 and N14 were Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, and L17 and N8 were Lact. rhamnosus.
TI  - Automated fluorescent in situ hybridization for the specific detection and quantification of oral streptococci in dental plaque.
AB  - Our aim was to develop a rapid fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) assay for the identification of different oral groups of streptococci in dental plaque and to combine it with digital image analysis for the automated enumeration of target cells. Cy3-labeled oligonucleotide probes specific for 16S rRNA gene sequences of the anginosus, mitis, mutans, and salivarius groups of streptococci were hybridized under stringent conditions with bacterial cultures or supragingival plaque samples that had been permeabilized with lysozyme. Probe specificity was determined with strains from 30 different species, mainly of oral origin. Results showed that probes ANG541, MIT447, SSP001, and SAL090 with specificity for the anginosus, mitis, mutans, and salivarius groups, respectively, the pan-reactive streptococcal probe STR405, the S. mutans specific probe MUT590, and the S. sobrinus specific probe SOB174 were well-suited for the identification of cultured streptococci. Probes STR405, MIT447 and SSP001 were then successfully applied to enumerate automatically bacteria of the recognized taxa in 144 supragingival plaque samples. On the average, total streptococci accounted for 8.2%, streptococci of the mitis and mutans groups for 3.9 and 1.7%, respectively, of the plaques. The combined application of FISH and automated image analysis provides an objective time-saving alternative to culture or PCR for the enumeration of selected oral streptococci in dental plaque.
TI  - Caries risk assessment from dental plaque and salivary Streptococcus mutans counts on two culture media.
AB  - This study attempted to determine which combination of plaque or saliva, and tryptic soy agar, bacitracin (TSY20B) or mitis salivarius, bacitracin media, yielded the highest caries-predictive values for mutans counts in children with different caries prevalence. Sixty children were divided into three equally sized groups: caries free, low caries and high caries. Eighteen months later, their caries incidence and initial mutans count were compared. Fissure plaque on TSY20B yielded a high correlation between mutans counts and caries prevalence (P<0.009, r=3346) and incidence (P<0.003, r=4521). The caries-predictive values obtained demonstrate that the coefficient of variation of mutans counts from lower first-molar fissure plaque on TSY20B accounts for 20.4% of the variation in final caries index. This strong correlation provides a valuable tool for the identification of caries-prone individuals.
TI  - Mutans streptococci prevalence in Puerto Rican babies with cariogenic feeding behaviors.
AB  - PURPOSE: Previous studies have demonstrated that babies are at higher risk for mutans streptococci (ms) colonization if their mothers have dense salivary ms reservoirs relative to babies who have mothers with negligible salivary reservoirs. This communication provides data that identifies another potential risk factor (use of a nursing bottle at bedtime and/or naptime that contains a substrate other than water) for baby infection by ms. METHODS: The study population consisted of 60 babies (28 males/32 females; mean age 15 mos; age range 12-18 mos) who were all healthy, caries free, and slept with a nursing bottle that contained a substrate other than water (NB+). Pooled maxillary incisor plaque and saliva samples were obtained and immediately placed in Reduced Transparent Fluid (RTF); they were serially diluted and plated onto Mitis Salivarius Agar plus Bacitracin (MSB) and blood agar plates within 4 hours of collection; the plates were incubated in an anaerobic environment for 48 h at 37 C and then placed for 24 h under aerobiosis prior to examination; representative ms colonies were isolated and subjected to mannitol and sorbitol fermentation tests for taxonomic verification. Plates with colony counts between 20 and 300 were utilized to determine the % of ms in each sample. RESULTS: Fifty one of the 60(85%) babies harbored ms in at least 1 of the 2 samples. The 95% confidence interval for the proportion of subjects with detectable levels of ms was 73%-93%. Fisher's exact test showed that babies 16-18 mos age were more likely to have detectable levels of ms than babies 12-15 mos age (p = 0.01). Levels of ms in plaque and saliva were as follows: < 0.1% (plaque 27/51, mean age 15 mos, sd 1.77; saliva 28/51, mean age 15 mos, sd 1.76); 0.1%-1.0% (plaque 4/51, mean age 14 mos, sd 1.5; saliva 6/51, mean age 15 mos, sd 1.46); > 1.0% (plaque 14/51, mean age 16 mos, sd 2.1; saliva 11/51, mean age 16 mos, sd 1.91). The density of infection did not vary by age for plaque (P = 0.32) or saliva (P = 0.64). CONCLUSION: These findings support the concept that NB+ is a strong indicator for ms infection in Puerto Rican babies; that prevalence of infection increases with age; and that density of infection does not vary with age in this population.
TI  - Genotypic heterogeneity of Streptococcus oralis and distinct aciduric subpopulations in human dental plaque.
AB  - The genotypic heterogeneity of Streptococcus oralis isolated from the oral cavity was investigated using repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR. Unrelated subjects harbored unique genotypes, with numerous genotypes being isolated from an individual. S. oralis is the predominant aciduric bacterium isolated from noncarious tooth sites. Genotypic comparison of the aciduric populations isolated at pH 5.2 with those isolated from mitis-salivarius agar (MSA) (pH 7.0) indicated that the aciduric populations were genotypically distinct in the majority of subjects (chi(2) = 13.09; P = 0.0031). Neither the aciduric nor the MSA-isolated strains were stable, with no strains isolated at baseline being isolated 4 or 12 weeks later in the majority of subjects. The basis of this instability is unknown but is similar to that reported for Streptococcus mitis. Examination of S. oralis strains isolated from cohabiting couples demonstrated that in three of five couples, genotypically identical strains were isolated from both partners and this was confirmed by using Salmonella enteritidis repetitive element PCR and enterobacterial PCR typing. These data provide further evidence of the physiological and genotypic heterogeneity of non-mutans streptococci. The demonstration of distinct aciduric populations of S. oralis implies that the role of these and other non-mutans streptococci in the caries process requires reevaluation.
TI  - Adaptation of oral streptococci to low pH.
AB  - The strategies employed by oral streptococci to resist the inimical influences of acidification reflect the diverse and dynamic niches of the human mouth. All of the oral streptococci are capable of rapid degradation of sugar to acidic end-products. As a result, the pH value of their immediate environment can plummet to levels where glycolysis and growth cease. At this point, the approaches for survival in acid separate the organisms. Streptococcus mutans, for example, relies on its F-ATPase, to protect itself from acidification by pumping protons out of the cells. S. salivarius responds by degrading urea to ammonia and S. sanguis produces ammonia by arginolysis. The mechanisms by which these organisms regulate their particular escape route are now being explored experimentally. The picture that emerges is that the acid-adaptive regulatory mechanisms of the oral streptococci differ markedly from those employed by Gram-negative bacteria. What remains to be elucidated are the breadth of the acid-response systems in these organisms and how they permit the microbes to sustain themselves in the face of low pH and the bacterial competition present in their respective niches. In this article, we summarize reports concerning the means by which oral streptococci either utilize acidification to subdue their competitors or protect themselves until pH values return to a more favorable level.
TI  - The effect of nicotine on growth of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - There is little information available concerning the effects of nicotine on oral  bacteria; and in particular, Streptococcus mutans, an important microbe in the etiology of dental caries. To test the effects of nicotine, Streptococcus mutans were incubated in either 0 or 10(-1)-10(-7) M concentrations of nicotine and then plated onto mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. Colonies were counted and treatment groups compared. Both 10(-1) and 10(-2) M nicotine caused total inhibition of bacterial growth, while 10(-3) and 10(-4) M produced significantly more colonies than control. Also, 10(-6) and 10(-7) M nicotine produced a significant reduction in the mean number of colonies. These results suggest a biphasic, dosage-dependent effect of nicotine on the growth of Streptococcus mutans. Since 10(-3) M nicotine has been reported within the saliva of smokeless tobacco users, use of these products could stimulate growth of Streptococcus mutans and possibly place the user at increased risk for dental caries.
TI  - Characterization of recombinant, ureolytic Streptococcus mutans demonstrates an inverse relationship between dental plaque ureolytic capacity and cariogenicity.
AB  - Dental caries results from prolonged plaque acidification that leads to the establishment of a cariogenic microflora and demineralization of the tooth. Urease enzymes of oral bacteria hydrolyze urea to ammonia, which can neutralize plaque acids. To begin to examine the relationship between plaque ureolytic activity and the incidence of dental caries, recombinant, ureolytic strains of Streptococcus mutans were constructed. Specifically, the ureABCEFGD operon from Streptococcus salivarius 57.I was integrated into the S. mutans chromosome in such a way that the operon was transcribed from a weak, cognate promoter in S. mutans ACUS4 or a stronger promoter in S. mutans ACUS6. Both strains expressed NiCl(2)-dependent urease activity, but the maximal urease levels in ACUS6 were threefold higher than those in ACUS4. In vitro pH drop experiments demonstrated that the ability of the recombinant S. mutans strains to moderate a decrease in pH during the simultaneous metabolism of glucose and urea increased proportionately with the level of urease activity expressed. Specific-pathogen-free rats that were infected with ACUS6 and fed a cariogenic diet with drinking water containing 25 mM urea and 50 microM NiCl(2) had relatively high levels of oral urease activity, as well as dramatic decreases in the prevalence of smooth-surface caries and the severity of sulcal caries, relative to controls. Urease activity appears to influence plaque biochemistry and metabolism in a manner that reduces cariogenicity, suggesting that recombinant, ureolytic bacteria may be useful to promote dental health.
TI  - Influence of maternal xylitol consumption on acquisition of mutans streptococci by infants.
AB  - Xylitol is effective as a non-cariogenic sugar substitute. Habitual xylitol consumption appears to select for mutans streptococci (MS) with impaired adhesion properties, i.e., they shed easily to saliva from plaque. One hundred sixty-nine mother-child pairs participated in a two-year study exploring whether the mothers' xylitol consumption could be used to prevent mother-child transmission of mutans streptococci. All mothers showed high salivary levels of mutans streptococci during pregnancy. The mothers in the xylitol group (n = 106) were requested to chew xylitol-sweetened gum (65% w/w) at least 2 or 3 times a day, starting three months after delivery. In the two control groups, the mothers received either chlorhexidine (n = 30) or fluoride (n = 33) varnish treatments at 6, 12, and 18 months after delivery. The children did not chew gum or receive varnish treatments. MS were assessed from the mothers' saliva at half-year intervals and from the children's plaque at the one- and two-year examinations. The MS were cultured on Mitis salivarius agars containing bacitracin. The salivary MS levels of the mothers remained high and not significantly different among the three study groups throughout the study. At two years of age, 9.7% of the children in the xylitol, 28.6% in the chlorhexidine, and 48.5% in the fluoride varnish group showed a detectable level of MS. In conclusion, therefore, habitual xylitol consumption by mothers was associated with a statistically significant reduction of the probability of mother-child transmission of MS assessed at two years of age. The effect was superior to that obtained with either chlorhexidine or fluoride varnish treatments performed as single applications at six-month intervals.
TI  - The gene encoding IIAB(Man)L in Streptococcus salivarius is part of a tetracistronic operon encoding a phosphoenolpyruvate: mannose/glucose phosphotransferase system.
AB  - Glucose and mannose are transported in streptococci by the mannose-PTS (phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system), which consists of a cytoplasmic IIAB protein, called IIAB(Man), and an uncharacterized membrane permease. This paper reports the characterization of the man operon encoding the specific components of the mannose-PTS of Streptococcus salivarius. The man operon was composed of four genes, manL, manM, manN and manO. These genes were transcribed from a canonical promoter (Pman) into a 3.6 kb polycistronic mRNA that contained a 5'-UTR (untranslated region). The predicted manL gene product encoded a 35.5 kDa protein and contained the amino acid sequences of the IIA and IIB phosphorylation sites already determined from purified S. salivarius IIAB(Man)L. Expression of manL in Escherichia coli generated a 35 kDa protein that reacted with anti-IIAB(Man)L antibodies. The predicted ManM protein had an estimated size of 27.2 kDa. ManM had similarity with IIC domains of the mannose-EII family, but did not possess the signature proposed for mannose-IIC proteins from Gram-negative bacteria. From multiple alignment analyses of sequences available in current databases, the following modified IIC(Man) signature is proposed: GX3G[DNH]X3G[LIVM]2XG2[STL][LT][EQ]. The deduced product of manN was a hydrophobic protein with a predicted molecular mass of 33.4 kDa. The ManN protein contained an amino acid sequence similar to the signature sequence of the IID domains of the mannose-EII family. manO encoded a 13.7 kDa protein. This gene was also transcribed as a monocistronic mRNA from a promoter located in the manN-manO intergenic region. A search of current databases revealed the presence of IIAB(Man)L, ManM, ManN and ManO orthologues in Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis. This work has elucidated the molecular structure of the mannose PTS in streptococci and enterococci, and demonstrated the presence of a putative regulatory protein (ManO) within the man operon.
TI  - Relationship among mutans streptococci, "low-pH" bacteria, and lodophilic polysaccharide-producing bacteria in dental plaque and early enamel caries in humans.
AB  - Multiple interactions occur among major determinants of dental caries. We have studied the bacterial flora and pH-lowering capacity of the same dental plaques in relation to caries. The findings on the plaque flora are reported here. The buccal surfaces of upper teeth in each subject were selected for study. A low-caries group had no "white spot" caries (ws) in the selected dentition area; a higher-caries group averaged 4.1 ws in this area. The latter group was divided into subjects with 2, 3, or 4 ws and subjects with 5, 6, or 7 ws. Enumerated organisms in plaque samples (sound and ws sites) from all subjects were: (1) mutans streptococci (MS) on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin and mitis-salivarius agar; (2) non-mutans streptococci (non-MS) on mitis-salivarius agar; (3) organisms that were categorized according to their minimum pH in sugar broth, i.e., the predominant undifferentiated total flora on blood agar or the predominant non-MS flora on mitis-salivarius agar; and (4) iodophilic polysaccharide-storing organisms on trypticase-yeast extract-salts agar. Plaques covering ws lesions contained generally only low proportions (< 0.1%) of MS. The plaque proportions of all the above 4 bacterial groups were increased in the higher-caries group but were similar for s and ws sites in this group. Over half of the total plaque flora in subjects with 5, 6, or 7 ws consisted of "low-pH"-type organisms (minimum pH < 4.4). Many of these were neither MS nor "low-pH" non-MS. The numerical emergence of MS in plaque appeared to be preceded often by other types of "low-pH" bacteria, including the non-MS. Caries development in the absence or presence of MS as well as different bacterial successions in plaque can be explained readily by the dynamic and positive relationship among the factors carbohydrate consumption, plaque flora composition, plaque acidogenic potential, and caries activity.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of cavity disinfectants.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of four commercially available cavity disinfectants and one prescription mouthwash as they came into contact with bacteria commonly found in the oral cavity. Streptococcus mutans, salivarius, and Actinomyces viscosus were used in the study. Zones of microbial inhibition were measured in millimeters after 48 hours. The results of this study indicate that all of the antimicrobial agents demonstrated activity against the bacteria tested. Consepsis Solution produced the largest zones of inhibition against all three of the bacteria used.
TI  - Variables affecting salivary Streptococcus mutans counts in a cohort of 12-year-old subjects.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several factors such as toothbrushing, diet, acidogenic potential of  the mutans streptococci strain and site of the carious lesion can modify the salivary Streptococcus mutans (Sm) counts. In the present investigation the effect of some behavioural, clinical and microbiological variables on Sm salivary counts was evaluated in a cohort of 12-year-olds. METHODS: Forty subjects were examined by two calibrated examiners (GC, AL). The number of surfaces either decayed occlusal, decayed smooth or filled and the number of bleeding sextants, (clinical index for oral hygiene) were reported. Saliva was collected using a tongue depressor and was plated onto mitis salivarius agar with bacitracin and 20% sucrose. The presumptive Sm colonies were counted and the concentrations were logarithmically transformed. One Sm strain per subject was identified and the cariogenic potential evaluated as the minimum pH value recorded, during 5 hrs of incubation in 5% sucrose solution. The children's parents or guardians completed a questionnaire concerning the frequency of toothbrushing, the consumption of sweet foods and soft drinks and at what age the children started brushing their teeth. The effect of the explanatory variables on Sm count logarithms was evaluated by stepwise multiple regression. RESULTS: The regressors with significant additional explanatory power were cariogenic potential (b = -1.335, p = 0.00001, R2 increment = 0.312), decayed smooth surfaces (b = -0.456, p = 0.009, R2 increment = 0.114) and bleeding sextants (b = -0.113, p = 0.004, R2 increment = 0.062), whereas the power of filled surfaces was marginally significant (p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these results, it is suggested that acidogenicity is not only a cariogenic factor, but also a factor promoting colonization of oral sites by Sm, especially in subjects with a high frequency of sugar consumption.
TI  - Identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by analysis of transfer DNA intergenic spacer length polymorphism.
AB  - The utility of PCR analysis of transfer DNA intergenic spacer length polymorphism (tDNA-ILP) for the identification to the species level of clinically relevant viridans streptococci was evaluated with a collection of reference strains of 15 species of the salivarius, anginosus, mitis and mutans rRNA homology groups. PCR products generated by using fluorescent, outwardly directed, consensus tDNA primers were analysed by electrophoresis on denaturating polyacrylamide gels and by laser fluorescence scanning. Eleven species showed specific and distinct tDNA patterns: Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus criceti and Streptococcus ratti. Indistinguishable patterns were obtained among two groups of species: Streptococcus vestibularis and Streptococcus salivarius on the one hand and Streptococcus constellatus and Streptococcus intermedius on the other. S. mitis strains produced heterogeneous patterns that could be separated into three groups: a group containing S. mitis biovar 1 and two S. mitis biovar 2 groups, one of which clustered with S. parasanguinis strains while the other showed patterns unrelated to other species. These results agree in part with protein electrophoretic analysis showing that S. mitis biovar 2 strains belong to several streptococcal taxa. In conclusion, PCR analysis of tDNA-ILP holds promise for rapid identification of viridans streptococci that are difficult to identify by phenotypic tests.
TI  - An evaluation of the action of different root canal irrigants on facultative aerobic-anaerobic, obligate anaerobic, and microaerophilic bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to test the effect of different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, and cetrimide on the following bacterial strains: Facultative aerobes-anaerobes: Candida albicans ATCC 10231; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212; Escherichia coli ATCC 25,922; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27,853; Streptococcus mitis ATCC 9811; Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35668; Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419; and Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556. Microaerophiles: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 29522. Obligate anaerobes: Actinomyces odontolyticus ATCC 17929; Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25,586; Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277; and Prevotella melaninogenica ATCC 25845. Each irrigant was kept in contact with the bacterial species used for the experiment for 10, 20, or 30 min. Results showed that all irrigants had a bactericidal effect on both facultative aerobes-anaerobes and on microaerophilic and obligate anaerobic strains, in all concentrations and even after short periods of contact.
TI  - Effect of oleanolic acid-cyclodextrin inclusion compounds on dental caries by in  vitro experiment and rat-caries model.
AB  - Earlier work in vitro showed that oleanolic acid (OA) was a potential inhibitor of insoluble glucan (ISG) synthesis from mutans streptococci (MS). In this study, two oleanolic acid-cyclodextrin inclusion compounds (OA-CDs), oleanolic acid-G1-beta-cyclodextrin (OA-G1-beta CD) and oleanolic acid-beta-cyclodextrin (OA-beta CD), were assayed for their effects on ISG synthesis from Streptococcus mutans MT8148R, and on the growth of oral bacteria. OA-beta CD inhibited ISG synthesis by 55.3 and 37.4% at 62.5 and 15.6 micrograms/ml of OA, respectively. Both OA-CDs inhibited the growth of MS, S. sanguis, and S. salivarius at 4 to 8 micrograms/ml of OA. The anticariogenic effect of the OA-beta CD was examined in a rat-caries model. Rats in the infected control groups showed the highest caries score. The infected treatment group B (0.5% OA in diet) showed lower scores than the control group. These results suggest that OA-beta CD is a potential anti-caries agent.
TI  - Effect of ultrasonic cleaning on microorganisms.
AB  - PURPOSE: To establish a method to measure microbial kill caused by ultrasonic cleaning. Secondarily, to estimate the escape of bacteria from the ultrasonic cleaning solutions during operation of the unit. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three commercial enzymatic detergents and saline were used as cleaners. Depending on detergent, initial operational temperature was 21 degrees C, 37 degrees C or 60 degrees C. Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175 (S. mutans suspensions) was adjusted to a final concentration of 1.0 x 10(3) cells/mL in saline. Suspensions (2000 mL) at the desired temperatures were added to the cleaner. Aliquots were removed, serially diluted in letheen broth and spread plated over mitis salivarius agar. Appropriate amounts of detergent solutions were added to S. mutans suspensions and the cleaner operated for 20 minutes. Aliquots were then removed and plated. The process was repeated twice. Plates were aerobically incubated at 37 degrees C for 7 days and the colonies counted. The procedure was repeated using three temperatures of S. mutans suspensions (21 degrees C, 37 degrees C or 60 degrees C), but without detergent or ultrasound. Also, detergents were added to 21 degrees C S. mutans suspensions and allowed to sit for 20 minutes without ultrasonic cleaning. Microbial sampling was done as previously described. RESULTS: Results when ultrasound was used indicated that little kill (5-15%) occurred in 21 degrees C or 37 degrees C detergent solutions. Greater kill (25-35%) was noted with 21 degrees C and 37 degrees C saline. Complete kill was accomplished with 60 degrees C saline or the 60 degrees C detergent solution. When ultrasound and detergent were not used, there was no kill in 21 degrees C and 37 degrees C saline, but complete kill in 60 degrees C saline. In the absence of ultrasound no kill was noted in 21 degrees C S. mutans suspensions to which detergent had been added. Total kill of S. mutans was observed in 60 degrees C saline or 60 degrees C detergent with ultrasound or after a 20-minute exposure in 60 degrees C saline without ultrasonic cleaning. Very few bacteria escaped from the ultrasonic cleaning solutions into the air during the cleaning process. Placement of the unit lid effectively reduced emissions to zero.
TI  - The effects of histatin-derived basic antimicrobial peptides on oral biofilms.
AB  - Susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is strongly reduced by the formation of complex biofilms. We investigated whether synthetic histatin analogs with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro were also active against these complex mixtures of bacteria, as present in saliva and plaque. In a simplified model system for dental plaque, hydroxyapatite discs were placed in a continuous culture system comprised of Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonella parvula, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella intermedia. Ex situ treatment of the biofilms formed on these discs with 100 microg/mL of peptide dhvar4 significantly reduced facultative anaerobic, total anaerobic, and obligate anaerobic Gram-negative counts with 0.8, 0.5, and 0.5 log units, respectively. Ex vivo treatment of salivary bacteria gave reductions of 0.4, 0.7, and 1.5 log units, respectively. For ex vivo treatment of plaque bacteria, reductions of 0.4, 0.4, and 1.4 log units, respectively, were found. In both saliva and plaque samples, obligate anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were significantly more susceptible to dhvar4 than facultatively anaerobic or anaerobic bacteria as a whole (p=0.013 and p=0.018, for salivary bacteria, and p=0.021 and p=0.020 for plaque bacteria, respectively). Although the oral bacteria are protected by biofilm formation, the synthetic histatin analog caused a significant reduction of viable counts in a model for oral biofilm as well as in isolated oral biofilms.
TI  - Effect of low-molecular-weight chitosans on the adhesive properties of oral streptococci.
AB  - It was previously shown that a low-molecular-weight chitosan and its derivatives  N-carboxymethyl chitosan and imidazolyl chitosan inhibit Streptococcus mutans adsorption to hydroxyapatite. The ability of the same molecules to interfere with adhesive properties of other oral streptococci (Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus vestibularis) was tested. When saliva-coated or -uncoated hydroxyapatite beads were treated with N-carboxymethyl chitosan, a reduction varying from 60% to 98% depending on strains was observed. Low-molecular-weight chitosans and imidazolyl chitosan did not have any effect. Growth in N-carboxymethyl chitosan-supplemented medium (final concentrations ranging from 20 to 500 micrograms.ml-1) caused a dose related reduction in the adsorption of all strains to hydroxyapatite and in their affinity towards xylene. No effect was observed with low-molecular-weight chitosans and imidazolyl chitosan. In contrast to what observed with S. mutans, the three polysaccharides did not affect detachment from hydroxyapatite beads and adherence to cheek epithelial cells of the other streptococci. These results suggest that low-molecular-weight chitosans and/or imidazolyl chitosan, selectively affecting S. mutans adsorption to hydroxyapatite, may be very interesting as potential anti-dental caries agents.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Camellia sinensis extracts against dental caries.
AB  - Different bacteria were separated from saliva and teeth of cariogenic patients and identified by a variety of morphological and biochemical tests. Extracts of green tea strongly inhibited Escherichia coli, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus mutans. The antibacterial effect of green and black tea extracts were compared with those of amoxicillin, cephradine and eugenol.
TI  - Purification and properties of a bacteriocin of Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from dental plaque.
AB  - An extracellular bacteriocin of Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from dental plaque was purified and characterized. Its molecular mass was 3500 Da and pI was 10.5. This bacteriocin inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus salivarius, and Streptococcus mitis, but Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and other oral indigenous bacterial species examined were not inhibited. The mode of inhibition was found to be bacteriostatic.
TI  - [Alpha-hemolytic streptococci and root canal irrigants. An evaluation of the bactericidal efficacy of sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine gluconate plus cetrimide].
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The main bacterial species present in pulpal and periapical  microbic flora is alpha-hemolytic streptococci. They are regarded as facultative anaerobes which prefer to grow in anaerobiosis. Canal irrigation plays an important role in the success of endodontic treatment given that, on the one hand, it encourages the gradual elimination of the smear layer, and on the other it neutralises microbic flora in the root canal. The aim of this study was to test the microbiological efficacy of sodium hypochlorite 1% and s new generation irrigant based on chlorhexidine 0.2% and cetrimide 0.2%. METHODS: The test was performed on the following alpha-hemolytic streptococci bacteria (Dasit, Cornaredo, Italy): Streptococcus mitis ATCC 9811; Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35668; Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419; Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556. The working concentration (CFU/ml) was defined as 0.5 Mc Farland which corresponds to a concentration of microorganisms of approximately 1.5 x 10(8) bacteria. The following canal irrigants were used: 1) cetrimide 0.2% + chlorhexidine 0.2% (Cetrexidin Vebas, S. Giuliano Milanese, Italy); 2) NaOCl 1% (Ogna, Milan, Italy). Each individual substance remained in contact with the bacterial species used in the test for 10'-20'-30'. RESULTS: The results obtained show the bactericidal efficacy of both the irrigants used, even after a short period of contact. CONCLUSIONS: This does not mean that all irrigants are equal and/or promise the same results. This was a microbiological study, but it is nonetheless important to take other variables into account, such as contact time. Moreover, in order to increase the probabilities for the success of endodontic treatment, canal irrigants must also present other characteristics, namely: biocompatibility, scarce toxicity, high proteolytic power.
TI  - Acid-regulated proteins induced by Streptococcus mutans and other oral bacteria during acid shock.
AB  - Our previous research has demonstrated that with the more aciduric oral bacteria, an acid shock to sub-lethal pH values results in the induction of an acid tolerance response that protects the cells at extremely low pH (pH 3.0-4.0) that kills unadapted control cells maintained at pH 7.5 (Oral Microbiol Immunol 1997: 12: 266-273). In this study, we were interested in comparing the protein profiles of acid-shocked and control cells of nine organisms from three acid-ogenic genera that could be categorized as strong, weak and non-acid responders in an attempt to identify proteins that could be classified as acid-regulated proteins and which may be important in the process of survival at very low pH. For this, log-phase cultures were rapidly acidified from pH 7.5 to 5.5 in the presence of [14C]-amino acids for varying periods up to 2 h, the period previously shown to be required for maximum induction of the acid response. The cells were extracted for total protein and subjected to one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide chromatography with comparable control and acid-shocked protein profiles compared by scanning and computer analysis. Of particular interest were the proteins in the acid-shocked cells that showed enhanced labeling (i.e., synthesis) over the control cells, since these were considered acid-regulated proteins of importance in pH homeostasis. Streptococcus mutans LT11 generated the most rapid and complex pattern: a total of 36 acid-regulated proteins showing enhanced synthesis, with 25 appearing within the first 30 min of acid shock. The enhanced synthesis was transient with all proteins, with the exception of two with molecular weights of 50/49 and 33/32 kDa. Within the acid-regulated proteins were proteins having molecular weights comparable to the heat shock proteins and the various subunits of the membrane H+/ATPase. By comparison, the strong responder, Lactobacillus casei 151, showed the enhanced formation of only nine proteins within the first 30 min of the acid shock, with a total of 11 acid-regulated proteins formed during the 2-h adaptation period with enhanced synthesis transient for seven of these proteins. Streptococcus salivarius AT2 and Streptococcus gordonii TH12 had the formation of 6 and 8 proteins enhanced, while the weakly responding organisms, Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10,556 and Streptococcus oralis ATCC 10,557, exhibited 8 and 6 such proteins, respectively. Even non-responding strains unable to survive at very low pH, such as Streptococcus sobrinus CH125/43, Streptococcus mitis ATCC 12,261 and Actinomyces naeslundii 301-13 showed the initial formation of 3-9 acid-regulated proteins, but protein synthesis was not sustained over the entire adaptation period. Clearly, the survival of oral bacteria at very low pH is related, not to the total number of the acid-regulated proteins induced per se but to the formation of key proteins that function to augment normal pH homeostasis.
TI  - Effect of an alum-containing mouthrinse in children for plaque and salivary levels of selected oral microflora.
AB  - The purpose of the study was to assess the effect of daily supervised rinsing with a specially formulated, alum-containing mouthrinse on plaque and salivary levels of S. mutans, S. mitis and S. salivarius in caries susceptible children (12-14 years old) and to monitor the effect on the oral tissues and acceptability to subjects. Forty-five subjects were divided into 3 groups (n = 15). Group I received an experimental group with a mouthrinse containing hydrated aluminum potassium sulfate (alum). Group 2 received a vehicle control group containing the same mouthrinse, but without alum and Group 3 had a treatment control with distilled water. All subjects continued normal oral hygiene habits during the study. Salivary and plaque levels were obtained at base line, 2 weeks and 4 weeks and evaluated for microbiologic procedures. Also, potential adverse effects on oral tissues were performed during every visit. The mean plaque and salivary levels of oral Streptococcus (S. mutans, S. mitis, S. salivarius) for the experimental group were significantly reduced after 2 weeks and 4 weeks compared with baseline. The plaque and salivary levels of oral Streptococcus of experimental and vehicle control group differed statistically from each other after 4 weeks, with the strongest reduction in the experimental group and there was statistically difference between treatment control and vehicle control or experimental groups at each time interval. No evidence of deleterious effects to the oral tissues was observed. Daily use of an alum-containing mouthrinse was safe and produced significant reduction effect on plaque and salivary levels of oral Streptococcus and can be used in children for the preventive dentistry.
TI  - Acid production from lactulose by dental plaque bacteria.
AB  - Representative strains of oral streptococci, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were incubated overnight with lactulose or other carbohydrates and the final pH recorded. Most bacteria tested were able to metabolize lactulose with the exception of strains of Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lact. fermentum. Streptococcus mutans produced most acid overnight but the initial rate of acid production from lactulose by uninduced cultures was very low. Plaque pH was monitored in 12 volunteers following rinsing the mouth with lactulose, sucrose or sorbitol or Lactulose BP. These studies in vivo showed both lactulose and Lactulose BP to exhibit low acidogenic potential. Thus, although plaque bacteria are capable of fermenting lactulose, the results suggest that lactulose is likely to pose a small acidogenic challenge to teeth under normal conditions of use.
TI  - Antibacterial temporary filling materials: the effect of adding various ratios of Ag-Zn-Zeolite.
AB  - The effect of a new type of antibacterial temporary filling material was evaluated. Ag-Zn-Zeolite (Bactekiller, Kanebo, Japan) and SiO2 filler were incorporated into urethane acrylate monomer paste in amounts of 5/55, 10/50, 20/40 and 30/30 wt%, respectively. The present study was designed to use a dye penetration test to measure direct inhibition of bacterial growth of four oral bacteria (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis). The amounts of silver and zinc ions released from these materials were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The results indicated that the occurrence of marginal leakage was low in all of these materials. These materials exhibited prominent in-vitro antibacterial activity against S. mutans and S. mitis. The Ag-Zn-Zeolite in these materials was able to release very small but detectable amounts of Ag and Zn even 4 weeks after the immersion started. The larger the amounts of Ag-Zn-Zeolite that were incorporated, the greater the release of silver and zinc. However, it appears that increasing antibacterial activity is not promoted by the higher ratio of Ag-Zn-Zeolite.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of viridans group streptococci in Taiwan with an emphasis on the high rates of resistance to penicillin and macrolides in Streptococcus oralis.
AB  - The in-vitro susceptibilities of 13 antimicrobial agents were determined for 207  isolates of viridans group streptococci recovered from patients with significant infections in Taiwan during 1995 and 1997. Variable degrees of susceptibility existed among nine species. High-level penicillin resistance (MIC > or = 4.0 mg/L) was found most frequently in Streptococcus oralis (35%), followed by Streptococcus mitis (20%) and Streptococcus salivarius (8%). However, S. salivarius showed the lowest rate of susceptibility to penicillin (50%). Macrolide resistance also occurred most frequently in S. oralis isolates (55%) but in none of Streptococcus mutans. Penicillin and macrolides tended to be less active against isolates recovered from non-invasive sites than against those isolated from invasive sites. Imipenem was the most active beta-lactam against penicillin-resistant isolates. Ofloxacin, vancomycin and teicoplanin showed good in-vitro activity against all isolates, with MIC90s of 2, 1 and 0.25 mg/L, respectively. None of these isolates displayed high-level resistance to gentamicin and most isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol. These results indicate the species-related variability of susceptibility, especially to penicillin, macrolides and tetracycline. In addition to S. mitis, S. oralis also displayed high rates of resistance to penicillin and macrolides. The difference in susceptibilities between species of viridans streptococci indicates the importance of accurate identification and the need for continuing surveillance of antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Mutacin production by Streptococcus mutans may promote transmission of bacteria from mother to child.
AB  - The production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances, mutacins, by mutans streptococci varies among isolates. To find if the degree of mutacin activity of an isolate was related to its transmission between mother and her child, 19 mothers and their 18-month- to 3-year-old children were sampled for their oral mutans streptococci. In addition, the stability of mutacin activity was studied with isolates from the mothers and with isolates from five unrelated 5-year-old children in 5- to 7-year follow-up studies. A total of 145 oral mutans streptococcal isolates were serotyped by immunodiffusion, ribotyped, and mutacin typed by the stab culture technique. Mutacin was produced by 88% of the strains against more than 1 of the 14 indicator strains, representing mutans streptococci, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Streptococcus mutans isolates showed more inhibitory activity than did Streptococcus sobrinus isolates. Identical ribotypes had similar mutacin activity profiles within a subject, initially and in the follow-up studies, in all but two cases. The mothers harbored a total of 37 different mutans streptococcal ribotypes. Six children were negative for mutans streptococci. Transmission was probable in 9 of 20 mother-child pairs on the basis of the presence of identical strains, as determined by ribotyping and bacteriocin (mutacin) typing. S. mutans strains shared between a mother and her child showed a broader spectrum of inhibitory activity than did nontransmitted strains. In conclusion, the mutacin activity of clinical isolates is reasonably stable, and this virulence factor seems to be of clinical importance in early colonization by S. mutans.
TI  - Effect of enamel microabrasion on bacterial colonization.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine if microabraded surfaces inhibit Streptococcus mutans colonization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten extracted molars were obtained and sectioned in half mesio-distally. The mesial side was treated with microabrasion (PREMA Compound). The distal surface was designated as the control site. A plastic tube was secured on each surface with resin composite, exposing a surface of 13.2 mm 2. S. mutans 10,499 was cultured in TSB-YE supplemented with 5% sucrose and 2.5% glucose was added to each secured site in addition to 50 microliters of cell suspension. Samples were incubated in a 5% CO2 chamber for 7 days at 37 degrees C. Samples were taken from each site, incubated with dextranase (75 micrograms 1 ml), sonicated, and vortexed to disrupt cellular aggregates as much as possible. Samples were then plated on Mitis-Salivarius agar using a spiral plating system. Enumeration of numbers of colonizing bacteria was achieved following standard spiral plating system methodology. RESULTS: The mean for the microabraded group was 1.12 x 10(2) cfu/tooth and for the control it was 1.15 x 10(4). Analyzing the data revealed a significant difference (P = 0.0188).
TI  - Identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  - We have used a PCR assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (sodA(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (S. acidominimus, S. agalactiae, S. alactolyticus, S. anginosus, S. bovis, S. constellatus, S. canis, S. cricetus, S. downei, S. dysgalactiae, S. equi subsp. equi, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, S. equinus, S. gordonii, S. iniae, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguis, S. pneumoniae, S. porcinus, S. pyogenes, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus, S. suis, S. thermophilus, and S. vestibularis). Phylogenetic analysis of these sodA(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16S rRNA sequences. We have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their sodA(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the sodA(int) fragments of the type species. We propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.
TI  - Identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci to the species  level by PCR.
AB  - A PCR assay that allows identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci (Streptococcus gordonii, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. salivarius, and S. sanguis) to the species level and identification of milleri group streptococci (S. anginosus, S. constellatus, and S. intermedius) to the group level was developed. This assay was based on specific amplification of internal fragments of genes encoding D-alanine:D-alanine ligases which are species specific and ubiquitous in prokaryotes possessing peptidoglycan. The specificity of this assay was tested on 9 reference strains and 91 characterized clinical isolates. This assay offers a specific and rapid alternative to phenotypic or DNA-DNA hybridization methods for identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci.
TI  - Combined inhibitory effect of fluoride and hypothiocyanite on the viability and glucose metabolism of Streptococcus mutans, serotype c.
AB  - The separate and combined effects of peroxidase-generated hypothiocyanite (HOSCN/OSCN-) and F- ions on glucose uptake and growth of Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175 were investigated. S. mutans cells were grown to late exponential or stationary growth phase, harvested, washed and suspended in 2.0 ml of sterilized human whole saliva supplemented with 10 mM D-glucose. This saliva-bacteria mixture was supplemented with 5-150 microM H2O2 at pH 5.0 or 6.5. At pH 5.0, up to 103 +/- 21 microM HOSCN/OSCN- was generated. After 20 h of incubation at 37 degrees C, the saliva-bacteria suspension exposed to HOSCN/OSCN- were plated on mitis salivarius agar plates and incubated anaerobically for 2 days. Identical experiments were made with F- ions (0.5, 1.0 and 5.0 mM). Both HOSCN/OSCN- and F- caused a significant dose-dependent growth inhibition at pH 5.0, whereas no inhibition was observed at pH 6.5. When F- and HOSCN/OSCN- were added simultaneously at pH 5.0, an additive effect of growth inhibition was observed. In glucose incorporation experiments the bacteria-saliva mixture was exposed to 1 microM HOSCN/OSCN-, 0.5 mM F- or both. F-, HOSCN/OSCN- or their combination in sterilized whole saliva at pH 5.0 caused 14.2, 67.8 and 74.2% inhibition, respectively. These observations indicate that F- and HOSCN/OSCN- ions have an additive inhibitory effect on S. mutans and therefore their combination is likely to be more antibacterial than either agent alone.
TI  - Construction and characterization of a recombinant ureolytic Streptococcus mutans and its use to demonstrate the relationship of urease activity to pH modulating capacity.
AB  - To begin to understand the contribution of oral microbial ureolysis to the inhibition of dental caries, we sought to construct a recombinant, ureolytic mutans streptococcus and correlate the ureolytic capacity of plaque bacteria with pH moderating ability. Streptococcus mutans GS-5 was transformed with a plasmid containing the urease genes from Streptococcus salivarius 57.I. The recombinant strain, S. mutans AC04, stably maintained the urease genes. High levels of urease activity were detected, with a maximum specific activity of 0.9 mumol of urea hydrolyzed/min/mg cell dry weight when the growth medium was supplemented with 50 microM exogenous NiCl2. Harboring the recombinant plasmid, or growth in NiCl2, did not markedly affect the glycolytic capacity of S. mutans. In vitro pH drop analysis of S. mutans AC04, metabolizing glucose and physiologically relevant concentrations of urea simultaneously, demonstrated that increasing the urease activity of plaque bacteria resulted in a corresponding reduction in the depth and the duration of the glycolytic pH fall. The results demonstrate the feasibility of engineering urease producing S. mutans and suggest that enhancing the ureolytic capacity of dental plaque, particularly cariogenic plaque, may help to offset the progression of the caries process.
TI  - Inhibition of purified enolases from oral bacteria by fluoride.
AB  - Enolase activity in strains of oral streptococci previously has been found to be  inhibited by 50% (Ki) by fluoride concentrations ranging from 50 to 300 microM or more in the presence of 0.5 to 1.0 mM inorganic phosphate ions. In this study, enolase was extracted and partly purified by a two-step process from five oral bacterial species and the effect of fluoride on the kinetics of enolase examined. The molecular weight of the putative enolase proteins was 46-48 kDa. The Vmax values ranged from 20 to 323 IU/mg and K(m) for glycerate-2-phosphate from 0.22 to 0.74 mM. Enolase activity was inhibited competitively by fluoride, with Ki values ranging from 16 to 54 microM in the presence of 5 mM inorganic phosphate ions. Ki values for phosphate ranged from 2 to 8 mM. The enolase from Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556 was more sensitive to fluoride (Ki = 16 +/- 2) than was enolase from Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 10575 (Ki = 19 +/- 2) or Streptococcus mutans NCTC 10449 (Ki = 40 +/- 4) and all three streptococcal strains were more sensitive to fluoride than either Actinomyces naeslundii WVU 627 (Ki = 46 +/- 6) or Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 7469 (Ki = 54 +/- 6) enolases. The levels of fluoride found to inhibit the streptococcal enolases in this study are much lower than previously reported and are likely to be present in plaque, especially during acidogenesis, and could exert an anti-glycolytic effect.
TI  - A comparison of antimicrobial activity of etchants used for a total etch technique.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of eight commercially available etchant materials and positive and negative controls as they came into contact with bacteria commonly found within the oral cavity. The following bacteria were used in this study: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, and Actinobacillis actinomycetocomitants. The study was conducted in two parts: Part I--Etchants and controls placed within wells in agar plates; Part II--Enamel-dentin disks saturated with the etchants for 20 seconds and placed on the agar plates with the controls. Zones of microbial inhibition were measured in millimeters after 48 hours. The results of the study indicate that all of the etchants demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the bacteria tested.
TI  - [Evaluation of a rapid method for the identification of the Enterococcus genus].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The evaluation of the reliability of a group of three tests: pyrrolidonil-arilamidase, rapid test in NaCl esculin broth and group D antistreptococci agglutination for the rapid identification of the Enterococcus genus were performed. METHODS: One hundred fifty-eight strains of streptococci: 110 strains of Enterococcus faecalis, 8 E. faecium, 3 E. avium, 16 Streptococcus intermedius, 7 S. salivarius, 4 S. bovis, 4 S. constellatus, 2 S. sanguis and 1 strain of S. equinus, S. mitis, S. uberis and S. mutans were studied. The tests used were: rapid test in NaCl- esculin broth, pyrrolidonyl-arilamidase and antigroup D streptococcus agglutination (Patho Dx Strep D/PYR; Diagnostic Product Corporation). All catalase-negative gram-positive cocci or coccibacilli which were positive in the three tests were considered to belong to the Enterococcus genus. The usefulness of Gram staining in culture in thioglycolate broth was also studied comparing it with the results obtained with solid medium. RESULTS: The results of the proposed identification scheme were evaluated calculating different parameters: sensitivity 98%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value, 100%, and negative predictive value 94%. No significant differences were observed between the results obtained with Gram staining with thioglycolate broth and those obtained with solid medium except in the case of the Streptococcus mutans strain. CONCLUSIONS: The application of a combination of tests: pyrroidonyl-arilamidase, antistreptococci group D agglutination and rapid test in NaCl-esculin broth to catalase-negative gram-positive cocci and coccobacilli allows reliable identification in a maximum of three hours of strains belonging to the Enterococcus genus.
TI  - Rapid procedure for acid adaptation of oral lactic-acid bacteria and further characterization of the response.
AB  - Acid-adaptive responses could be induced readily in oral lactic-acid bacteria by  growing them in batch cultures with excess sugar or more conveniently and rapidly by transferring cells to acidified growth media for the time required for biomass doubling. The response of Streptococcus mutans GS-5 was induced in a progressive rather than all-or-nothing way, and the extent of acid tolerance was inversely related to the pH of the inducing medium over a range from 8.5 to 5. The weak acids fluoride, acetate, or lactate did not measurably enhance acid adaptation, and so the response did not appear to depend primarily on changes in delta pH or the proton motive force across the cell membrane. Transcription and translation to form new proteins did appear to be necessary, as indicated by inhibition of adaptation by rifampin or chloramphenicol and by lack of adaptation by cells suspended in phosphate buffer at pH 5. Streptococcus salivarius and Lactobacillus casei were acid adapted by the rapid method, and the method appeared to be generally useful for oral lactic-acid bacteria. The rapid induction of the response in multiple oral lactic-acid bacteria suggests that it is of general importance for maintaining a diversity of organisms in the oral microbiota, which is regularly subjected to acid stresses.
TI  - The phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system of oral streptococci and  its role in the control of sugar metabolism.
AB  - Oral streptococci are sugar-fermentative bacteria comprising at least 19 distinct species and are a significant proportion of the normal microbial population of the mouth and upper respiratory tract of humans. These streptococci transport several sugars by the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) which concomitantly catalyzes the phosphorylation and translocation of mono- and disaccharides via a chain of enzymic reactions that transfer a phosphate group from phosphoenolpyruvate to the incoming sugar. A number of PTS components, including HPr, Enzyme I and some Enzymes II, have been studied at the biochemical and/or genetical level in Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus. Moreover, compelling evidence indicates that the oral streptococcal PTS is involved in the regulation of sugar metabolism. Results are accumulating suggesting that a protein called IIABMan, as well as the phosphocarrier protein HPr, are key regulatory components that allow these bacteria to select rapidly metabolizable sugars, such as glucose or fructose, over less readily utilizable carbohydrates. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the molecular mechanisms by which oral streptococcal PTS exert their regulatory functions differ from mechanisms in other Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Mitis salivarius-bacitracin 10% sacarose agar for oral streptococci and Streptococcus mutans counts.
AB  - The MSB Agar (mitis salivarius-bacitracin) 20% sacarose medium is frequently used for the isolation and count of total streptococci and Streptococcus mutans. Although it is considered a selective culture medium for this micro-organism, S. mutans recovery in this medium is much lower than in this Mitis Salivarius Agar (MSA). Because the number of S. mutans in saliva is used for estimating caries risk and activity from a microbiological stand point, the aim of this work was to find a modification of the MSB 20% sacarose medium so that it would offer not only selectivity in the isolation but also maximum recovery. This would detect people at risk more efficiency and would evaluate the preventive odontological treatments more accurately. The results show that: 1) the greatest recovery of total streptococci and S. mutans is obtained in the MSB 10% sacarose medium, 2) S. mutans must be incubated in aerobiosis and the total streptococci in a candle jar (10% CO2). MSB 10% sacarose medium is proposed as a choice medium for the microbiological estimation of cariogenic risk and activity, to detect infection levels and evaluate preventive odontological treatments.
TI  - Sinusitis of dental origin.
AB  - Acute or chronic sinusitis may be odontogenic. Bacteria involved in odontogenic sinusitis are specific organisms associated with the teeth (Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mutans, anaerobic germs). They are often secondary to an intrasinus foreign body following periodontitis. The treatment is both naso-sinusal and dental. Cysts of the maxilla can also invade the sinus. In particular, radiculo-dental cysts (periapical) must be surgically excised, in some cases associated with a middle meatotomy. Finally, one should look for oro-antral fistulae. The surgical technique for its closure should take into account the reversibility of the sinus lesions.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence analysis of the Streptococcus gordonii glucosyltransferase gene, gtfG.
AB  - Streptococcus gordonii has an extracellular glucosyltransferase (GTF) that polymerizes the glucose moiety of sucrose to form both water-soluble and water-insoluble glucans. Whereas multiple gtf genes have been identified in strains of mutans streptococci and Streptococcus salivarius, a single gene, designated gtfG, encodes the GTF of S. gordonii Challis. gtfG is also unique among the characterized gtfs in that it has a described regulatory determinant, rgg. Furthermore, the GTF activity in S. gordonii undergoes reversible phase variation between high and low levels. In order to gain insight into this novel GTF system, the nucleotide sequence of gtfG was determined and found to consist of a 4,734 base pair open reading frame encoding a protein with a deduced molecular weight of ca. 174,000. gtfG was similar to other sequenced gtfs with a conserved signal sequence followed by a ca. 600-bp region distinctive for gtfG, a conserved region encoding a putative catalytic active site and a series of six direct repeats in the carboxyl terminal region implicated in glucan binding. Although comparison of gtfG to other gtfs did not show a basis for the primer-independence of the encoded enzyme or the nature of the glucan products, the gtfG sequence data provide an important basis for further studies of these enzymes.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of dentin bonding systems, resin-modified glass ionomers,  and polyacid-modified composite resins.
AB  - The antibacterial effects of the dentin bonding systems Syntac, ProBOND, Gluma 3-Step, the resin-modified glass ionomers Photac-Fil, Fuji Lining LC, Fuji II LC, and the polyacid-modified composite resins VariGlass, Geristore, and Infinity were evaluated using the cariogenic bacteria S mutans, L salivarius, S sobrinus, and A viscosus in vitro with a modified cylinder drop plate agar diffusion assay. All glass ionomers, the polyacid-modified composites, and the primers and adhesives of the dentin bonding systems exhibited various degrees of antibacterial activity against most of the test bacteria. The antibacterial activity of the adhesives of dentin bonding systems was anticipated because of the glutaraldehyde used in their formulations. However, the antibacterial activity of the various primers was unexpected and indicates a dual antibacterial action of these systems.
TI  - The effect of areca nut on salivary and selected oral microorganisms.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect on the growth of salivary and selected oral microorganisms of areca nut, aqueous extracts of the nut, its major alkaloid arecoline and the components tannic acid and catechin of its tannin fraction. The antibacterial properties of the above were tested on Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Candida albicans and Fusobacterium nucleatum and, as a control, Staphylococcus aureus. This was followed by investigating its effect on salivary organisms cultured from the saliva after chewing boiled areca nut. Extracts inhibited the growth of the selected organisms in a concentration dependent manner, baked and boiled nuts being significantly more potent than raw nut. Growth of C. albicans was the least affected by the nut extracts. Tannic acid was strongly antibacterial but not catechin or arecoline. No antibacterial effect could be demonstrated on salivary organisms after chewing the nut for 5 minutes but exposure of saliva to the cud for 1 hour caused a significant depression of bacterial growth. It is concluded that the hydrolysable tannins in the tannin fraction, which include tannic acid, are responsible for the antibacterial properties of the nut and that prolonged intraoral exposure to the nut can suppress bacteria in the mouth.
TI  - Salivacin 140, a novel bacteriocin from Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius T140 active against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Fifteen of 353 environmental isolates of lactic acid bacteria consistently showed activity against Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, and/or Propionibacterium acnes. Strain T140, isolated from the surface of Japanese pampas grass leaves and identified as Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius, also had activity against several Lactobacillus species, Staphylococcus aureus and Yersinia enterocolitica. Since the antagonistic factor(s) produced by T140 was sensitive to a proteolytic enzyme, it was concluded that a bacteriocin (named salivacin 140) was involved in the inhibition activity. Strain T140 required a high initial pH (7.5-8.5) in agar plates for bacteriocin production.
TI  - Surface location of HPr, a phosphocarrier of the phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system in Streptococcus suis.
AB  - HPr is a low-molecular-mass phosphocarrier protein of the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP): sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) found in the cytoplasm or associated with the inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane. Treatment of Streptococcus suis cells with a Sorvall Omnimixer, a technique used to extract cell surface components, resulted in the extraction of a major protein with a molecular mass of 9 kDa. Several lines of evidence suggested that this protein was HPr: (i) the S. suis protein showed homology over the first 35 N-terminal amino acid residues with the HPrs of Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus mutans, including the signature sequence for the site of PEP-dependent phosphorylation; (ii) it cross-reacted with the S. salivarius anti-HPr antibody preparation; (iii) it could be phosphorylated by enzyme I at the expense of PEP, and by a membrane-associated kinase at the expense of ATP; and (iv) it possessed phosphocarrier activity when used as a source of HPr in an in vitro PTS assay. The data suggested that a portion of the cellular HPr is associated with the external cell surface in S. suis, a result that was confirmed by immunogold electron microscopy. The cellular HPr of S. suis consisted of two forms that could be distinguished by the presence or the absence of the N-terminal methionine. Amino acid sequence analysis indicated that the cell-surface-associated HPr of S. suis lacked the N-terminal methionine residue.
TI  - Inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an HPr(Ser-P)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-P), has been documented for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus bovis, and Lactococcus lactis, but not for other Gram-positive bacteria. Using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that Enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated ATP-dependent HPr(Ser) kinase that phosphorylates Ser-46 in HPr of the phosphotransferase system. A small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, HPr(Ser-P)-activated sugar-P phosphatase (Pase II), previously identified only in Lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, or Bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. Further, Lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks Pase II. The results reveal that Pase II is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-P hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. They provide correlative evidence that Pase II initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.
TI  - Initial pH as a determining factor of glucose consumption and lactic and acetic acid production in oral streptococci.
AB  - Lactic and acetic acid production was evaluated from six strains of oral streptococci, viz Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus sobrinus cultured in the presence of 1, 5, 10 mM glucose and without glucose, at initial pH values of 5, 5.5, 6 and 7. S. sobrinus and S. salivarius caused the greatest decreases in pH. At pH values of 5 and 5.5, lactic acid and acetic acid production in the species tested was discordant with residual glucose levels. Acid production from protein was especially great in S. mutans and S. salivarius.
TI  - Oral streptococci with genetic determinants similar to the glucosyltransferase regulatory gene, rgg.
AB  - The Streptococcus gordonii Challis glucosyltransferase structural gene, gtfG, is  positively regulated by the upstream gene, rgg, the only described gtf regulatory determinant in oral streptococci. Southern hybridization analyses indicated that rgg-like and gtfG-like determinants were present on the same HindIII fragment in strains of S. gordonii, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus oralis, whereas no rgg-like determinants were detected in mutans streptococci, Streptococcus mitis, and Streptococcus salivarius.
TI  - Cross-reactivity between human sialyl Lewis(x) oligosaccharide and common causative oral bacteria of infective endocarditis.
AB  - The expression of sialy-Lewis(x) (sLe(x); Neu5Ac alpha 2-3 Gal beta 1-4) (Fuc alpha 1-3) GlcNAc-R) on oral bacteria producing infective endocarditis was determined by a whole-cell enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and an immunoelectron microscopy using the well-characterized anti-sLe(x) monoclonal antibody SNH-3 (mAb SNH-3; IgM class). mAb SNH-3 reacted strongly with whole cells of oral bacteria: Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens and Porphyromonas gingivalis. The negatively stained immuno-electron micrograph of Streptococcus pyogenes showed many reactive gold particles on the cell surface. Our findings demonstrated the existence of immunologic mimicry between the sLe(x) oligosaccharide and cell surface antigens of many species associated with infective endocarditis. We propose the hypothesis that if these bacteria escape their normal habitats, the surface components that mimic the sLe(x) oligosaccharide might bind to host antigens of the selectin family which could promote binding to endothelial cells and, consequently, initiation of the events leading to infective endocarditis.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  - In addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. This investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol, Super EBA and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria Streptococcus fecalis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus species, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli B and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, Prevotella (Bacteroides) buccae, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella (Bacteroides) intermedia, Prevotella (Bacteroides) melaninogenica, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. After growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees C. Impregnated discs with the Super EBA liquid were used as positive controls. The antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and Scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials. Impregnated discs with Super EBA liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. Both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. Mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. Zinc oxide-eugenol and Super EBA pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Regulation of ATP-dependent P-(Ser)-HPr formation in Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus salivarius.
AB  - Sugar transport via the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) phosphotransferase system involves PEP-dependent phosphorylation of the general phosphotransferase system protein, HPr, at histidine 15. However, gram-positive bacteria can also carry out ATP-dependent phosphorylation of HPr at serine 46 by means of (Ser)HPr kinase. In this study, we demonstrate that (Ser)HPr kinase in crude preparations of Streptococcus mutans Ingbritt and Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 25975 is membrane associated, with pH optima of 7.0 and 7.5, respectively. The latter organism possessed 7- to 27-fold-higher activity than S. mutans NCTC 10449, GS-5, and Ingbritt strains. The enzyme in S. salivarius was activated by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) twofold with 0.05 mM ATP, but this intermediate was slightly inhibitory with 1.0 mM ATP at FBP concentrations up to 10 mM. Similar inhibition was observed with the enzyme from S. mutans Ingbritt. A variety of other glycolytic intermediates had no effect on kinase activity under these conditions. The activity and regulation of (Ser)HPr kinase were assessed in vivo by monitoring P-(Ser)-HPr formation in steady-state cells of S. mutans Ingbritt grown in continuous culture with limiting glucose (10 and 50 mM) and with excess glucose (100 and 200 mM). All four forms of HPr [free HPr, P approximately (His)-HPr, P-(Ser)-HPr, and P approximately (His)-P-(Ser)-HPr] could be detected in the cells; however, significant differences in the intracellular levels of the forms were apparent during growth at different glucose concentrations. The total HPr pool increased with increasing concentrations of glucose in the medium, with significant increases in the P-(Ser)-HPr and P approximately HHis)-P-(Ser)-HPr concentrations. For example, while total PEP-dependent phosphorylation [P approximately(His)-HPr plus P approximately (His)-P-(Ser)-HPr] varied only from 21.5 to 52.5 microgram mg of cell protein (-1) in cells grown at the four glucose concentrations, the total ATP-dependent phosphorylation [P-(Ser)-HPr plus P approximately (His)-P-(Ser)-HPr] increased 12-fold from the 10 mM glucose-grown cells (9.1 microgram mg of cell protein (-1) to 106 and 105 microgram mg(-1) in the 100 and 200 mM glucose-grown cultures, respectively. (Ser)HPr kinase activity in membrane preparations of the cells varied little between the 10, 50, and 100 mM glucose-grown cells but increased threefold in the 200 mM glucose-grown cells. The intracellular levels of ATP, glucose-6-phosphate, and FBP increased with external glucose concentration, with the level of FBP being 3.8-fold higher for cells grown with 200 mM glucose than for those grown with 10 mM glucose. However, the variation in the intracellular levels of FBP, particularly between cells grown with 100 and 200 mM glucose, did not correlate with the extent of P-(Ser)-HPr formation, suggesting that the activity of (Ser)HPr kinase is not critically dependent on the availability of intracellular FBP.
TI  - Sequence, expression, and function of the gene for the nonphosphorylating, NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - We report the sequencing of a 2,019-bp region of the Streptococcus mutans NG5 genome which contains a 1,428-bp open reading frame (ORF) whose putative translation product had 50% identity to the amino acid sequences of the nonphosphorylating, NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases (GAPN) from maize and pea. This ORF is located approximately 200 bp downstream of the ptsI gene coding for enzyme I of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase transport system. Mutant BCH150, in which the putative gapN gene had been inactivated, lacked GAPN activity that was present in the wild-type strain, thus positively identifying the ORF as the S. mutans gapN gene. Another strain of S. mutans, DC10, which contains an insertionally inactivated ptsI gene, still possessed GAPN activity, as did S. salivarius ATCC 25975, which contains an insertion element between the ptsI and gapN genes. Since the wild-type S. mutans NG5 lacks both glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and NADH:NADP oxidoreductase activities, the NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is important as a means of generating NADPH for biosynthetic reactions.
TI  - Distribution of proteins similar to IIIManH and IIIManL of the Streptococcus salivarius phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system among oral and nonoral bacteria.
AB  - In Streptococcus salivarius, the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP):mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system, which concomitantly transports and phosphorylates mannose, glucose, fructose, and 2-deoxyglucose, is composed of the general energy-coupling proteins EI and HPr, the specific membrane-bound IIIMan, and two forms of a protein called IIIMan, with molecular weights of 38,900 (IIIManH) and 35,200 (IIIManL), that are found in the cytoplasm as well as associated with the membrane. Several lines of evidence suggest that IIIManH and/or IIIManL are involved in the control of sugar metabolism. To determine whether other bacteria possess these proteins, we tested for their presence in 28 oral streptococcus strains, 3 nonoral streptococcus strains, 2 lactococcus strains, 2 enterococcus strains, 2 bacillus strains, 1 lactobacillus strain, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Three approaches were used to determine whether the IIIMan proteins were present in these bacteria: (i) Western blot (immunoblot) analysis of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins, using anti-IIIManH and anti-IIIManH rabbit polyclonal antibodies; (ii) analysis of PEP-dependent phosphoproteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; and (iii) inhibition by anti-IIIMan antibodies of the PEP-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose (a mannose analog) by crude cellular extracts. Only the species S. salivarius and Streptococcus vestibularis possessed the two forms of IIIMan. Fifteen other streptococcal species possessed one protein with a molecular weight between 35,200 and 38,900 that cross-reacted with both antibodies. In the case of 9 species, a protein possessing the same electrophoretic mobility was phosphorylated at the expense of PEP. No such phosphoprotein, however, could be detected in the other six species. A III(Man)-like protein with a molecular weight of 35,500 was also detected in Lactobacillus casei by Western blot experiments as well as by PEP-dependent phosphoprotein analysis, and a protein with a molecular weight of 38,900 that cross-reacted with anti-III(Man) antibodies was detected in Lactococcus lactis. In several cases, the involvement of these putative III(Man) proteins in the PEP-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose was substantiated by the inhibition of phosphorylation activity of anti-III(Man) antibodies. No proteins cross-reacting with anti-III(Man) antibodies were detected in enterococci, bacilli, and E. coli. In S. aureus, a membrane protein with a molecular weight of 50,000 reacted strongly with the antibodies. This protein, however, was not phosphorylated at the expense of PEP.
TI  - Adherence of Candida albicans to a cell surface polysaccharide receptor on Streptococcus gordonii.
AB  - Candida albicans ATCC 10261 and CA2 bound to cells of the oral bacteria Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus sanguis when these bacteria were immobilized onto microtiter plate wells, but they did not bind to cells of Streptococcus mutans or Streptococcus salivarius. Cell wall polysaccharide was extracted with alkali from S. gordonii NCTC 7869, the streptococcal species to which C. albicans bound with highest affinity, and was effective in blocking the coaggregation of C. albicans and S. gordonii cells in the fluid phase. When fixed to microtiter plate wells, the S. gordonii polysaccharide was bound by all strains of C. albicans tested. The polysaccharide contained Rha, Glc, GalNAc, GlcNAc, and Gal and was related compositionally to previously characterized cell wall polysaccharides from strains of S. oralis and S. sanguis. The adherence of yeast cells to the immobilized polysaccharide was not inhibitable by a number of saccharides. Antiserum raised to the S. gordonii NCTC 7869 polysaccharide blocked adherence of C. albicans ATCC 10261 to the polysaccharide. The results identify a complex cell wall polysaccharide of S. gordonii as the coaggregation receptor for C. albicans. Adherent interactions of yeast cells with streptococci and other bacteria may be important for colonization of both hard and soft oral surfaces by C. albicans.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the gene coding for dextranase from Streptococcus salivarius.
AB  - We cloned and sequenced the dextranase (Dex) (1,6-alpha-glucanhydrolase; EC 3.2.1.11)-encoding gene from Streptococcus salivarius (Ss) strain M-33. Recombinant clones from an Ss genomic library specifying Dex activity were identified as colonies surrounded by transparent halos on blue dextran plates. One of the clones had a 4.3-kb KpnI fragment containing the gene coding for an 826-amino-acid polypeptide with a molecular mass of 87.9 kDa, which corresponds well to that of native Dex from the Ss culture supernatant. There was no sequence homology between the gene encoding Ss Dex and the gene encoding dextran glucosidase of S. mutans, or between their protein products.
TI  - Effectiveness of ethylene oxide for sterilization of dental handpieces.
AB  - Ethylene oxide gas has been utilized as an alternative method for sterilization of dental handpieces, as it is less corrosive than steam. However, its effectiveness for sterilization of the internal components of dental handpieces has not been established. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of ethylene oxide and steam for sterilization of dental handpieces. Unused handpieces and handpieces which had been exposed to clinical dental procedures ('clinical') were contaminated with Streptococcus mutans, exposed to steam or ethylene oxide, and flushed with sterile saline. Washings were plated on mitis-salivarius agar, and colonies identified and counted. No viable colonies could be established from washings from 'clinical' or 'unused' handpieces exposed to steam. However, viable colonies could be established from 'clinical' handpieces exposed to ethylene oxide. This data suggests that a substance entrapped within 'clinical' handpieces (possibly the biofilm) may protect bacteria from ethylene oxide gas, preventing adequate sterilization.
TI  - Delmopinol interactions with cell walls of gram-negative and gram-positive oral bacteria.
AB  - The main purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence of delmopinol hydrochloride on the cell surface morphology of gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial cells by using transmission electron microscopy. A second purpose was to evaluate the extraction of cell wall material caused by delmopinol and the binding of radiolabelled delmopinol to the various strains. Fresh isolates and type strains of gram-negative rods associated with periodontal disease, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and strains of the gram-positive streptococci Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus salivarius, were exposed to 3.2 mM (0.1%) or 6.4 mM (0.2%) delmopinol hydrochloride from 1 to 90 min. For electron microscopy the cells were fixed and negatively contrast-stained. Treatment with 6.4 mM delmopinol for 1 min resulted in marked ultrastructural changes of cell wall components and the outer cell membrane of the 3 gram-negative species compared with control cells, whereas the gram-positive streptococci treated with delmopinol showed little or no morphologic alteration as compared with untreated cells. The result from the electron microscopy was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins released from bacterial cells treated as for electron microscopy. More material was extracted from the gram-negative rods than from the gram-positive cocci. Significantly more delmopinol bound to the gram-negative rods than to the streptococci. It appears that the amphiphilic properties of delmopinol make gram-negative rods more vulnerable to delmopinol than gram-positive streptococci.
TI  - Differences in the detection and enumeration of mutans streptococci due to differences in methods.
AB  - Different methods reported for assessing mutans streptococci (MS) make the direct comparisons of results across studies difficult. To quantitate the variations of MS estimates attributable to differences in method, stimulated and unstimulated saliva samples and oral swab samples were compared with pooled dental-plaque samples. Detection of MS in stimulated saliva samples was in excellent agreement with the presence of MS in pooled plaque samples. MS detection in unstimulated saliva samples, however, was significantly discordant with that in either pooled plaque or oral swab samples. When caries status was used as the criterion of validity of MS estimates, stimulated saliva samples demonstrated a sensitivity (94%) similar to that of pooled plaque samples, but exhibited a lower specificity (11%) than that of pooled plaque samples (17%). As a result, the measure of association between MS and caries was biased (towards null) when MS status was based on stimulated saliva samples. Interestingly though, in enumerating MS, stimulated saliva samples yielded significantly higher levels of MS (about 1.5 log10 increase) with a lower variability compared to unstimulated saliva samples. The use of different culture media for detection of MS gave different results as well. MS detection was poor (kappa = 0.31) and MS levels were lower (p = 0.0001) when samples were grown on glucose-sucrose-potassium tellurite-bacitracin agar compared to mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. Together with the relative ease of sampling and processing, these findings collectively justify the use of plaque samples for the qualitative assessment of MS and stimulated saliva samples for the quantitative assessment of MS, while providing a basis for adjustment of estimates when comparing results across studies.
TI  - Determination of 16S rRNA sequences of Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus gordonii and phylogenetic relationships among members of the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - We determined the 16S rRNA sequences of the type strains of Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus gordonii and calculated the phylogenetic distances between those organisms and other members of the genus Streptococcus. The viridans group streptococci were separated into five phylogenetic groups; we named these groups the anginosus group, the mitis group, the salivarius group, the bovis group, and the mutans group. S. mitis and S. gordonii clustered in the mitis group together with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus parasanguis at levels of sequence homology of more than 96%. Within this group, S. mitis, S. oralis, and S. pneumoniae exhibited more than 99% sequence homology with each other, although the DNA-DNA similarity values for their total chromosome DNAs were less than 60%.
TI  - Inhibition of saliva-induced oral streptococcal aggregation by blood group glycoproteins.
AB  - The inhibition of saliva-induced oral streptococcal aggregation with anti-sera (anti-A, anti-B, anti-AB and anti-B treated with galactose), normal human serum (NHS), blood group-specific lectins (UEA-I, HBA, GPA, BSI-B4, GS-I), non-specific blood group lectins (MPA, SBA) and carbohydrates (galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine, L-fucose) was studied. Streptococcal species and strains included S. mutans 318, S. mutans 10449, S. mutans NG-8, S. salivarius and S. cricetus HS-6. The saliva was obtained from three subjects with secretor status (2 blood group B persons, 1 blood group A person). The data obtained from experiments performed with S. mutans 10449 and S. mutans NG-8 suggest the involvement of the H-antigenic determinant in the aggregation mechanism of the first strain and of the group B determinant for the second strain. The aggregation of S. salivarius only by B saliva might be related to a galactose-specific lectin on this strain and to some properties of its cell surface (hydrophobicity and the fibrillar surface layer). S. cricetus HS-6 aggregation was inhibited in different degrees by all the inhibitors used. The results demonstrate that interactions between oral streptococci and salivary components depend on the strain and species and on the individual saliva samples.
TI  - [Clinical significance of bacteremia caused by streptococci of the viridans group].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The viridans group Streptococcus (SVG) include species which may have different pathogenic capacity. This study was aimed at evaluating the clinical significance of bacteremia by different species of SVG. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred ninety-four clinical records of patients with blood culture(s) isolation (Hemoline/BioMerieux) of SVG (Api 20 STREP/BioMerieux) over 9 years were reviewed with criteria of clinical significance being established and the results analyzed by the chi square test. RESULTS: The most frequent species of SVG isolated were: S. sanguis II (29.4%), S. mitis (27.3%) and S. anginosus (12.9%). With regard to the criteria established, 36% of the isolates were clinically significant, associating S. anginosus with significant bacteremia (p = 0.001) and S. mitis with non significant bacteremia (p = 0.04). More than half of the isolations of S. anginosus, S. bovis, S. mutans and S. adjacens were clinically significant with this rate being lower in the remaining species (S. sanguis I, S. sanguis II, S. mitis, S. salivarius and S. acidominimus). The significant isolations correspond with endocarditis (S. sanguis II being responsible for 44%; p = 0.05). In 54.3% of the cases followed by abscesses or other localized infections and severe sepsis in patients with a solid or hematologic tumor with a mortality of 20%. The endocarditis/other disease relation was: greater for the existence of endocarditis for S. sanguis II, S. sanguis I, S. mutans, S. bovis and S. adjacens; similar in both diseases for S. mitis, and greater for the existence of a non endocardic disease for S. anginosus. CONCLUSIONS: In this series the isolation of SVG group was clinically significant in 36% of cases with a probability of clinical significance and disease association related to the species isolated of SVG.
TI  - Site-related streptococcal attachment to buccocervical tooth surfaces. A correlative micromorphologic and microbiologic study.
AB  - Scanning electron (SEM) microscopy of epoxy replicas made from dental impressions has shown that in buccal gingival recession the root surfaces are devoid of cementum, leaving the dentin exposed. In this study replication techniques were applied to correlate the micromorphology of the buccocervical region with early streptococcal attachment. The subjects were 27 healthy young adults. The buccocervical surfaces of all the premolars were meticulously cleaned. The subjects fasted for 2 h before impression-taking. Replicas were made from impressions in hydrophilic A-silicone, and streptococcal attachment was visualized by light microscopy of mitis-salivarius agar replicas incubated anaerobically for 48 h. The surface micromorphology was documented by SEM of corresponding epoxy replicas. Colonization only 2 h after cleaning was very sparse. Sites with healthy or inflamed gingivae had markedly different colonization patterns in the sulcular region. In 4 subjects with a total of 12 sites where gingival recession, undetected clinically, was disclosed by SEM, representative colonies were retrieved and identified microbiologically to species level. Two healthy sites per subject were also sampled. Streptococcus mutans and S. sobrinus were identified from eight sites with exposed root dentin. S. oralis predominated on the enamel surfaces. The method offers a valuable complement to in situ and in vitro microbiologic studies of exposed dentin and a novel technique for sampling clinical isolates of streptococci.
TI  - Definition of a fundamental repeating unit in streptococcal glucosyltransferase glucan-binding regions and related sequences.
AB  - The C-termini of the glucosyltransferases (Gtfs) of oral streptococci are responsible for glucan binding. These glucan-binding domains (GBDs) are composed of a series of repeated sequences that have been classified into four different classes (A-D) by virtue of sequence similarity and which, by inference, have been suggested to be of functional importance. In contrast, we propose that repeat sequences evolve in response to selection for an increase in the number of copies of a particular domain through multiple duplication events occurring at different times. According to this hypothesis, repeats should possess various degrees of similarity, especially if only key residues are of functional importance. Analysis of the GBDs of the Gtfs indicated that a common fundamental repeat, designated the "YG" repeat, could be discerned within the "A", "B", "C", and "D" repeats. Similar elements were also conserved in the ligand-binding repeats of the Clostridium difficile toxins and the lysins and the PspA protein of Streptococcus pneumoniae, suggesting that similar selective pressures had also been imposed on these sequences. Analysis of the "YG" repeats present in the GtfJ and GtfK of Streptococcus salivarius indicated that some of the "YG" repeats in the GBDs of these proteins had arisen as a result of duplication events involving a series of three sequential "YG" repeats.
TI  - Sequence and expression of the genes for HPr (ptsH) and enzyme I (ptsI) of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase transport system from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - We report the sequencing of a 2,242-bp region of the Streptococcus mutants NG5 genome containing the genes for ptsH and ptsI, which encode HPr and enzyme I (EI), respectively, of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase transport system. The sequence was obtained from two cloned overlapping genomic fragments; one expresses HPr and a truncated EI, while the other expresses a full-length EI in Escherichia coli, as determined by Western immunoblotting. The ptsI gene appeared to be expressed from a region located in the ptsH gene. The S. mutans NG5 pts operon does not appear to be linked to other phosphotransferase transport system proteins as has been found in other bacteria. A positive fermentation pattern on MacConkey-glucose plates by an E. coli ptsI mutant harboring the S. mutans NG5 ptsI gene on a plasmid indicated that the S. mutans NG5 EI can complement a defect in the E. coli gene. This was confirmed by protein phosphorylation experiments with 32P-labeled phosphoenolpyruvate indicating phosphotransfer from the S. mutans NG5 EI to the E. coli HPr. Two forms of the cloned EI, both truncated to varying degrees in the C-terminal region, were inefficiently phosphorylated and unable to complement fully the ptsI defect in the E. coli mutant. The deduced amino acid sequence of HPr shows a high degree of homology, particularly around the active site, to the same protein from other gram-positive bacteria, notably, S. salivarius, and to a lesser extent with those of gram-negative bacteria. The deduced amino acid sequence of S. mutans NG5 EI also shares several regions of homology with other sequenced EIs, notably, with the region around the active site, a region that contains the only conserved cystidyl residue among the various proteins and which may be involved in substrate binding.
TI  - Bactericidal action of tachyplesin I against oral streptococci.
AB  - Tachyplesin I, a polycationic antimicrobial peptide isolated from hemocytes of horseshoe crabs, kills bacteria by disrupting the membrane potential of the cytoplasmic membrane. The present study shows that, among 36 oral streptococcal strains, 12 of 21 Streptococcus sanguis, 3 Streptococcus mutans, 9 Streptococcus salivarius and 3 Streptococcus milleri strains were susceptible to tachyplesin I, whereas 9 S. sanguis strains were resistant. Interestingly, these resistant strains include the clinical isolates from both Kawasaki disease and Behcet patients. According to the time-kill study, tachyplesin I inhibited irreversibly the growth of S. sanguis, S. mutans and S. salivarius strains within 20 min and an S. milleri strain within 80 min. Although it has been suggested that Escherichia coli cultured in rich media were more susceptible to tachyplesin I, the present results show that only 3 S. milleri strains were more sensitized to tachyplesin I in a glucose-supplemented medium, and other tested strains were not. Similarly, only 4 strains were more resistant to tachyplesin I in saline than these were in a rich medium.
TI  - Identification of viridans streptococci associated with bacteraemia in neutropenic cancer patients.
AB  - Twenty-three viridans streptococcal isolates from pyrexial neutropenic patients with various malignant diseases were studied in a comprehensive identification scheme. Fourteen isolates were identified as Streptococcus oralis, five as S. mitis and two as S. salivarius but the remaining two could not be identified reliably. The virulence mechanisms associated with the ability of these species to survive and grow in vivo require further investigation but may involve the production of specific glycosidase and proteolytic enzyme activities.
TI  - Conservation of salivary glycoprotein-interacting and human immunoglobulin G-cross-reactive domains of antigen I/II in oral streptococci.
AB  - In this study we localized more precisely the salivary glycoprotein-interacting and the human immunoglobulin G (hIgG)-cross-reacting domains on the SR molecule, an antigen I/II-related protein from S. mutans serotype f. Mapping of the SR molecule with polypeptides expressed by subclones covering the entire molecule and with synthetic peptides demonstrates that the salivary glycoprotein-binding domain is located in the N-terminal alanine-rich repeats of the SR molecule. In order to investigate the degree of conservation of both regions in various oral streptococci, we tested the reactivity of 8 representative strains of the mutans group and 11 nonmutans oral Streptococcus strains (S. anginosus, S. milleri, S. constellatus, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. sanguis, S. gordonii, S. salivarius, and S. mitis strains) with antipeptide antibodies in a whole-cell enzyme linked immunosorbent assay together with colony hybridization analysis using DNA probes designed to map these two regions. All the mutans group strains except S. rattus and the 11 nonmutans streptococcal strains showed a high conservation of the C-terminal part of the SR molecule, especially the hIgG-cross-reacting domain, and less homology for the N-terminal salivary glycoprotein-binding region. Almost all of the sera from patients with rheumatic disease reacted strongly with SR from S. mutans serotype f, P1 from S. mutans serotype c, and four peptides located in the hIgG-cross-reacting region and not with peptides located at the C and N termini and in the proline-rich repeats. These results confirm that epitopes located within this region are immunogenic in humans and could lead to the synthesis of natural anti-IgG antibodies.
TI  - Mucin-sulphatase activity of some oral streptococci.
AB  - Mucin-sulphatase activity, measured using a 35S-[SO4(2-)]-labelled colonic mucin  substrate, was detected in whole cells of Streptococci isolated from the human oral cavity. The highest levels of sulphatase activity were found in all strains of Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis and in half of the strains of Streptococcus mutans tested. Little or no activity was detected in 9 of the 11 Streptococcus oralis strains examined, in the 4 Streptococcus constellatus strains, and in the 3 Streptococcus anginosus isolates tested. The highest enzyme levels were obtained from the two fresh Streptococcus gordonii isolates. This is the first report of such activity in oral microorganisms. Streptococcal mucin-sulphatase may contribute to the destruction of salivary mucins and mitigate their protective functions in the oral cavity, and be a determinant in the development of dental caries.
TI  - Low surface tension calcium hydroxide solution is an effective antiseptic.
AB  - The antimicrobial effects of a saturated calcium hydroxide solution, and in combination with 10% and 20% detergent, were evaluated on Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Neisseria sp., diphtheroid, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus sp., Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis and Candida albicans. The saturated calcium hydroxide solution was effective against only four of the 11 microorganisms studied over a 60-min exposure time. The calcium hydroxide solutions containing detergent killed all 11 test organisms over a 30-min exposure time. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0.01). No statistically significant difference in antimicrobial action was found between the 10% and 20% detergent calcium hydroxide solutions (P > 0.01). However, the low surface tension (46.5 x 10(-3) Nm-1) and high pH (10.8) of the calcium hydroxide solution with 20% detergent establish it as the more effective solution.
TI  - Interaction of the salivary glycoprotein EP-GP with the bacterium Streptococcus salivarius HB.
AB  - The interaction of the human salivary glycoprotein EP-GP with a number of oral bacterial species, following incubation with human whole saliva, has been investigated. EP-GP could be detected with a specific monoclonal antibody, by means of ELISA or by electrophoresis in combination with Western Transfer. The results indicated that EP-GP is bound only by Streptococcus salivarius, and not by the other tested strains of bacteria, Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides fragilis, S. gordonii, S. oralis, S. sanguis, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. rattus, S. constellatus, and S. anginosus. Binding of EP-GP to S. salivarius is mediated by a protein-protein interaction, which was found to be pH-dependent with a maximum binding between pH 5 and 6. For further characterization of the binding of EP-GP to S. salivarius, four mutants were tested, each of them lacking different cell wall antigens. EP-GP was bound to all mutants in amounts comparable with the wildtype, in spite of the different surface antigen compositions. We were able to identify a 27-kD EP-GP binding protein, by extraction of S. salivarius-cell wall antigens and electrophoretic techniques. In addition to EP-GP, S. salivarius also bound two other salivary proteins, namely, secretory IgA and low-molecular-weight mucin (MG-2).
TI  - Grouping of oral streptococcal species using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy in comparison with classical microbiological identification.
AB  - The grouping and identification made by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) of 40 oral streptococcal strains was compared with their known taxonomic positions. Grouping was obtained by cluster analysis on the spectral distances between the first derivative spectra of the strains. Spectra were divided into five spectral 'windows' and cluster analysis was either on either a combination of all five windows or on a selected window. The oral streptococci were divided into two main clusters, mutans streptococci and other streptococci. This division was based mainly on the spectral information contained in the window between 1300-900 cm-1, indicative of polysaccharide and phosphate-carrying compounds. In the grouping based on the entire spectrum, species clusters could be observed for Streptococcus crista, Strep. salivarius and Strep. rattus. A few strains were placed in wrong clusters because of intra-strain variance. It is concluded that the grouping of these oral streptococcal species was good and similar to the classical taxonomy and that FT-IR might develop into a new identification method for oral streptococci.
TI  - Antibacterial effectiveness of dentin bonding systems.
AB  - This study examined the antibacterial activities of several commercially available glass ionomer cements, dentin bonding systems and luting agents by employing both agar plate diffusion (APD) and growth inhibition (GI) methods. Amalgam and resin composites were also tested as control materials. In both methods (APD and GI), cylindrical specimens were used. Four bacteria strains were tested: Streptococcus mutans, S. salivarius, S. mitis and S. sanguis. These studies were performed using standardized innoculums with selective media, and the assayed materials were directly applied on the assay cultures and plates. The results of agar plate assay were in accordance with the results of growth inhibition method. The glass ionomer cements showed marked antibacterial activity. On the contrary, amalgam, composites, luting agents and dentinal bonding systems did not affect bacterial growth. The sensitivity of the growth method showed that all the strains were inhibited in the same way by each inhibitory material. The data suggest that the use of glass ionomer cements as cavity liners/bases may reduce the consequences of microleakage due to its antibacterial properties.
TI  - Glucose stimulates cAMP accumulation in the oral bacterium Actinomyces viscosus.
AB  - Actinomyces viscosus T14V, a Gram-positive bacterium found in the oral cavity, was found to be insensitive to glucose-mediated catabolite repression. Basal levels of beta-galactosidase (18-26 U) were observed at all phases of growth regardless of the culture conditions. Further, beta-galactosidase could not be induced with lactose, or with a known inducer of the enzyme, isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside, or with dibutyryl cAMP. Glucose, on the other hand, stimulated cAMP accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. Fructose and sucrose mimicked the effects of glucose on cAMP accumulation, whereas galactose, mannose and maltose had lesser stimulatory effects. Other carbon sources, i.e., lactose, alpha-methylglucoside, ribose, xylose and succinate were without effect. Glucose and alpha-methylglucoside were found to stimulate cAMP accumulation in toluene-permeabilized cells, in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, theophylline. Glucose did not stimulate cAMP levels in other Gram-positive bacteria including Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis and S. salivarius but did cause cAMP accumulation in other strains of A. viscosus. The results suggest that glucose effects on cAMP metabolism are independent of the induction of beta-galactosidase as presently defined for Escherichia coli, and that the effects appear to be selective to the A. viscosus bacteria. The results also suggest that glucose stimulates cAMP accumulation via activation of adenylate cyclase.
TI  - The resistance and adaptation of selected oral bacteria to mercury and its impact on their growth.
AB  - Selected strains of oral Streptococcus and Actinomyces have been tested for their ability to grow in the presence of mercury. Strains were tested for growth on a semi-defined medium with low mercury-binding characteristics. Sensitivities were initially measured on agar plates, and subsequently, selected strains were grown in broth so that the impact of mercury on the growth characteristics could be determined. Streptococci were more resistant to mercury (5 micrograms/mL to 40 micrograms/mL) than Actinomyces (< 5 micrograms/mL to 30 micrograms/mL). The most resistant streptococci included S. mitis biovar 1, S. salivarius, S. sobrinus, and one strain of S. mutans, all of which grew on agar with 40 micrograms/mL of mercury. Two other S. mutans strains were more sensitive, being inhibited by 10 and 20 micrograms/mL mercury. The most resistant Actinomyces was A. naeslundii genospecies 1 (ATCC12104), which grew on medium with 30 micrograms/mL mercury; two strains of Actinomyces were completely inhibited by 5 micrograms/mL. Mercury caused increased lag times and reduced cell density in broth cultures. Enrichment cultures of samples of human dental plaque showed that streptococci were the most resistant organisms that could be cultured on the medium and that these strains could adapt to relatively high mercury concentrations. S. oralis and S. mitis biovar 1 were the most resistant organisms isolated from enriched cultures, growing in broth media with 65 micrograms/mL mercury. Mercury was bound to cell walls and cell cytoplasm of streptococci grown in the presence of mercury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Sequence of the gtfK gene of Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 25975 and evolution of the gtf genes of oral streptococci.
AB  - Many strains of oral streptococci secrete glucosyltransferases (GTFs) that polymerize sucrose into glucans that form an integral part of the plaque matrix on the tooth surface. Recently, we reported the cloning of two closely linked GTF-encoding genes (gtfJ and gtfK) from Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 25975 as well as the sequence of gtfJ, which encodes a primer-dependent GTF that synthesizes an insoluble product (a GTF-I). In this communication we report the sequence of gtfK, which encodes a primer-dependent GTF that synthesizes a soluble product (a GTF-S), as well as the sequence of a small downstream open reading frame of unknown function. The deduced sequence of GtfK was compared with those of seven other streptococcal Gtfs and an unrooted phylogenetic tree constructed. This analysis suggested that Gtfs with similar product specificities do not form phylogenetic clusters and was consistent with currently accepted phylogenetic schemes. The tree was tested by constructing a series of 'sub-trees' from different blocks of the alignment. Evidence was obtained for recombination events involving gtfB and gtfC from S. mutans GS-5, gtfJ and gtfK from S. salivarius, as well as the gtfI genes from S. downei and S. sobrinus. The recombination events between gtfB and gtfC, and between the two gtfI genes, were confirmed by examining divergences at silent sites.
TI  - The cell-bound fructosyltransferase of Streptococcus salivarius: the carboxyl terminus specifies attachment in a Streptococcus gordonii model system.
AB  - The ftf gene, coding for the cell-bound beta-D-fructosyltransferase (FTF) of Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 25975, has been analyzed, and its deduced amino acid sequence has been compared with that of the secreted FTF of Streptococcus mutans and the levansucrases (SacBs) of Bacillus species. A unique proline-rich region detected at the C terminus of the FTF of S. salivarius preceded a hydrophobic terminal domain. This proline-rich region was shown to possess strong homology to the product of the prgC gene from pCF10 in Enterococcus faecalis, which encodes a pheromone-responsive protein of unknown function, as well as homology to the human proline-rich salivary protein PRP-4. A series of 3'-OH deletions of the S. salivarius ftf gene expressed in Streptococcus gordonii Challis LGR2 showed that the C terminus was required for cell surface attachment in this heterologous organism, as only the complete gene product was cell bound. This cell-bound activity was released in the presence of sucrose, suggesting that the mode of attachment and release of the S. salivarius FTF in S. gordonii was similar to that in its native host.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of dentinal bonding agents.
AB  - The susceptibility of five bacterial species to seven dentinal bonding agents was examined in vitro. Agar diffusion tests using filterpaper disks containing 10 microL each of conditioner, primer, or resin were performed on blood agar and mitis salivarius bacitracin agar. Chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. After incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were measured. Of all the compounds tested, Gluma cleanser and Gluma etchant showed the strongest growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. No antibacterial effect was noted for Prisma Universal Bond 2 and Superlux Universal Bond 2 systems. The primers of Gluma, Denthesive, and Scotchbond 2 displayed antibacterial activity that, in some cases, was comparable to that of 0.2% chlorhexidine. Zones of inhibition were seen for the resin materials of Scotchbond 2 and Tripton with Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces viscosus. No inhibition was seen after these resins were cured, whereas the antibacterial effect of XR-Bond on S sanguis and A viscosus was not affected by light curing.
TI  - Longitudinal study of relations between human salivary antimicrobial proteins and measures of dental plaque accumulation and composition.
AB  - Many studies have attempted to relate levels of antimicrobial proteins in saliva  to oral health; results have been inconsistent, and one reason might be inconsistency of measures of plaque and saliva within subjects. This study investigated associations between plaque and salivary variables in longitudinal data. Whole saliva, and 8-h plaque pooled from buccal first permanent molars, was obtained from 32 dental students on Tuesdays from 3:00-6:00 p.m. over 4 weeks. Salivary flow rate was determined, and samples were assayed for lysozyme, lactoferrin, total peroxidase, myeloperoxidase, OSCN-, sIgA and total protein. Colonies on mitis-salivarius agar were assigned to Streptococcus sanguis, Strep. mutans or Strep. salivarius on the basis of morphology, supplemented by the API Rapid Strep identification system. Consistency of values within subjects across weeks was evaluated by repeat-measures analysis of variance and intraclass correlation; data were transformed to reduce skewness. Pearson's r was used to determine associations between plaque and salivary variables. Significant intraclass correlations (alpha = 0.05) were found for all salivary variables except myeloperoxidase, and for total flora, total streptococci, Strep. sanguis and Strep. sanguis as a proportion of total streptococci. Significant Pearson correlations with Strep. sanguis as a proportion of total streptococci were found for total protein (r = -0.24), sIgA (r = -0.22), lactoferrin (r = -0.19) and OSCN- (r = 0.20) when data from all weeks were pooled (n = 128). Strep. sanguis proportions tended to be low in subjects with high values for salivary proteins; the range of proportions was wider in subjects with low salivary values. These findings suggest some consistency of weekly values for many plaque and salivary variables. They also support previous cross-sectional data which suggested that salivary antimicrobial proteins may have some effect on plaque composition. This study was made before recent revisions in streptococcal taxonomy, and further research is needed to clarify interactions of salivary proteins with currently defined species.
TI  - Intra- and inter-individual variation in salivary flow rate, buffer effect, lactobacilli, and mutans streptococci among 11- to 12-year-old schoolchildren.
AB  - Both intra- and inter-individual variation in salivary flow rate, buffer effect,  and the levels of salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were analyzed in 128 11-year-old children. The follow-up period was 9 months, with six saliva samplings done at regular intervals. Inter-individual variation was relatively large in paraffin-stimulated salivary flow rate: low (< 1.0 ml/min) and high (> or = 2.0 ml/min) flow rates were measured in 18% and 13% of the children, respectively. Intraindividual variation during the follow-up period was found in 63% of the boys and in 73% of the girls. The buffer effect stayed stable in all samplings in 59% of the boys and in 42% of the girls. Buffer effect was significantly (p < 0.001) lower in girls than in boys. Mutans streptococci were analyzed by a chair-side method (Strip mutans test) and by cultivation on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin (MSB) agar plates. The results of the two methods correlated highly significantly (r = 0.79, p < 0.001). With the Strip mutans test no variation in test scores occurred in 49% of all subjects in all six samplings, whereas the respective percentage for MSB scores was only 19%. No variation in salivary lactobacilli occurred in only 18% of the subjects, and in 13% the intraindividual variation was as high as > or = 3 logs. These results show that in young teenagers with a developing dentition, simultaneous changes in behavioral, hormonal, and dietary factors make single-point measurements of salivary factors too unreliable for caries-diagnostic or predictive purposes.
TI  - pH changes in human dental plaque from lactose and milk before and after adaptation.
AB  - pH changes in human dental plaque in vivo from lactose and milk have been studied in four separate mouthrinse experiments. (1) pH was measured in plaque samples of 12 subjects before and after 6 weeks of frequent daily mouthrinsing with 10% lactose. The pH decreases were significantly more pronounced after the adaptation period than before (p < 0.001), 4 of the 12 subjects showing about the same low plaque pH from lactose as from glucose. (2) Similar to the previous experiment, frequent daily mouthrinsing with low-fat bovine milk in 10 subjects resulted in more pronounced pH decreases in plaque after an adaptation period of 4 weeks (p < 0.001). (3) Single mouthrinses, without any prior adaptation, with bovine standard milk, human breast milk, lactose-hydrolysed bovine standard milk, 5% lactose and 5% sucrose were compared regarding the effect on plaque pH in 7 subjects. All solutions resulted in pH falls. The most pronounced were found with sucrose, followed by the lactose-hydrolysed milk. (4) Bovine standard milk, 5% lactose and 10% sucrose were compared after a single mouthrinse in 5 subjects using interdental plaque pH wire telemetry. Lactose and milk were fermented more slowly than sucrose. In a separate study, acid production from lactose was also measured in two oral strains each of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus sanguis. The results from these experiments indicated that at least part of the lactose transport and catabolism in all studied streptococcus strains seems to be regulated by inducible enzymes.
TI  - Distribution and isolation frequency of eight streptococcal species in saliva from predentate and dentate children and adults.
AB  - The isolation frequency and distribution of eight recently defined streptococcal  species have been investigated in the saliva of adults and that of both predentate and dentate children. The effects of frequency of sugar intake and tooth presence on the distribution of streptococcal species were also analyzed. Saliva samples were collected from 121 subjects divided into three study groups: (a) 56 predentate children (predentate group), (b) 37 dentate children (dentate group), and (c) 28 adults (adult group). Up to 17 biochemical and enzymatic tests were used to categorize streptococcal isolates into S. mitis, S. oralis, S. salivarius, S. anginosus, S. sanguis, S. vestibularis, S. mutans, and S. gordonii. The mean total and streptococcal salivary colony-forming units (CFU) were lowest in the predentate group and highest in the adult group. Streptococci were found in all the study subjects, and there was no obvious relationship between the total or streptococcal CFU and the number of teeth or the frequency of sugar intake. There was a wide variation in the isolation frequency of streptococcal species in the three study groups. S. mitis, S. oralis, and S. salivarius were the most frequent species isolated, and together they comprised 83% of the total streptococcal isolates. In contrast to studies using older classifications, S. sanguis was a minor species in the saliva though found more often in adults than in children (p < 0.04). S. anginosus was a minor species found in about 10% of adults and children. S. gordonii was detected rarely and only in dentate subjects. S. mutans was detected only in dentate subjects, significantly greater in adults (57.1%) than in children (5.4%, p < 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Prevalence of dental caries in 4- to 5-year-old children partly explained by presence of salivary mutans streptococci.
AB  - The correlation between dental caries and the number of oral mutans group streptococci (ms) present has been shown to be weak. The aim of this investigation was to study associations between caries experience (decayed, missing, and filled surfaces [dmfs]) and the number of ms in stimulated saliva, with emphasis on the level of disease and the confounding effect of regular intake of sweets, the presence of salivary lactobacilli, and oral hygiene. In some 2,700 4- to 5-year-old South African children of different ethnic origins, caries was diagnosed on the basis of World Health Organization criteria and saliva samples were analyzed for ms after cultivation on mitis salivarius-bacitracin agar and for lactobacilli by using the Dentocult kit. Oral hygiene was scored on the basis of the Greene and Vermillion simplified debris index, while data on intake of sweets were derived from extensive interviews. Pearson's coefficient of correlation was computed, and multiple regression analysis was performed to correct for confounding factors. The distribution of the children in the eight caries classes was strongly associated with the ms class (P < 0.001), with those in the lower ms classes generally having low dmfs scores and those in the higher ms classes having dmfs scores distributed over the whole range. The r value for the two variables was 0.25 for the total material; this was reduced to 0.18 by correction for confounding factors. The corresponding values for children with caries were 0.21 and 0.17, for those in the 1 to 6 dmfs interval they were 0.07 and 0.03, and for those in the 7 to 81 dmfs interval they were 0.16 and 0.14. The data imply that the explanatory values for ms, those for the lower caries interval not counted, ranged from 6 to 2%. The unexpected results for children with caries might be due to their distribution pattern. It is concluded that there is a need for reevaluation of ms as a risk factor in dental caries.
TI  - Emergence of immune competence in saliva.
AB  - Saliva contains essentially no IgA at birth. However, secretory immune responses  to oral and non-oral microbial antigens emerge early in life. We have investigated the characteristics of these responses in salivas of infants less than 1 month through 4 years of age, using cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches. Antibody specificities (IgA, IgA1, and IgA2) were measured in ELISA and Western blot analysis to antigens of Streptococcus mitis and S. salivarius that colonize during the neonatal period. Antibodies reactive with S. sanguis and mutans streptococci, which colonize later in the infant's life, were also determined. Concurrent investigation of the oral flora of each infant was performed and related to the observed antibody specificities. The secretory nature of the immunoglobulins in these salivas was analyzed immunologically and chromatographically. The primary molecular form of salivary IgA was dimeric in all salivas tested. Both IgA subclasses were found, although a subset of infant salivas initially contained > 90% IgA1. IgM (> 1 microgram/ml) was detected in 58% of 3- to 17-week-old infants. By 2 months of age, salivas from most infants contained IgA antibody reactive with at least two S. mitis components. Many salivas also contained antibody reactive with S. salivarius components. By the end of the first year, most salivas contained IgA1 and IgA2 antibody to S. mitis antigens. Maturation of secretory responses in the second and third year was evidenced by the appearance of increased concentrations and additional specificities of salivary IgA antibodies to S. mitis antigens. Antibody to S. mitis, S. salivarius, and S. sanguis extracellular components was detected only after infection with the respective species.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Physico-chemical and structural properties of the surfaces of Peptostreptococcus  micros and Streptococcus mitis as compared to those of mutans streptococci, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus salivarius.
AB  - The surface properties of nine Streptococcus mitis and four Peptostreptococcus micros strains from the oral cavity were examined and compared with a large group of oral streptococci. Zeta potential and contact angle measurements were employed to determine physico-chemical cell surface properties. In addition, elemental surface concentration ratios were obtained via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and surface structures were examined with transmission electron microscopy. The S. mitis and P. micros strains were found to have higher isoelectric points, higher hydrophobicities and higher N/C surface concentration ratios than some other oral streptococci. The combined data suggest that both species possess large amounts of surface protein. All the S. mitis strains displayed abundant surface fibrils in negative staining, but the P. micros strains were devoid of surface appendages indicating that surface protein is present in different forms in the two species. The surfaces of S. mitis and P. micros type strains differed significantly from the other strains examined.
TI  - Dental caries and its determinants among recent immigrants from rural Ethiopia.
AB  - Adults (35-45 yr old) and children (5 and 12 yr old) recently arrived in Israel from rural areas in Ethiopia were examined. Caries levels were low: e.g. DMFT = 0.31 among 12-yr-olds, and 1.27 amongst adults. The 5-yr-olds were 86.8% caries-free, while 12-yr-olds were 81.8% and adults 54% caries-free respectively. According to interview data, the diet in Ethiopia had been based on local agricultural products and was almost sugar-free. The mean total count of salivary bacteria, as determined on blood agar, was 3.4 x 10(8); mean count of Streptococcus viridans, on mitis salivarius, was 6.7 x 10(7); and mean count of S. mutans, as determined on mitis salivarius with bacitracin, was 1.7 x 10(7). These levels were all high and were not significantly different from a control group of 20 Israelis. The mean number of lactobacilli, on Rogosa agar, was 2.75 x 10(4), which was significantly higher than among the controls (3.6 x 10(3). Salivary pH levels were generally similar between the Ethiopian group and the controls. Salivary flow was significantly higher for the Ethiopians (1.93 ml/min) than for controls (1.16 ml/min). Low levels of caries in this population can be attributed to an almost sugar-free diet and high salivary flow, but not to the composition of oral microflora.
TI  - Immunoglobulin A antibody activity to mutans streptococci in parotid, submandibular and whole saliva.
AB  - Antigen extracts of 9 strains of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus mitis were separated in acrylamide gels by electrophoresis. Strains of the same genotype of mutans streptococci were found to have virtually identical sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis patterns but differed clearly from other genotypes of mutans or with the reference strains S. salivarius and S. mitis. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody activity to antigens of S. mutans, S. sobrinus and S. mitis in the parotid, submandibular and whole saliva of 12 people was detected by Western blotting. IgA antibodies reacted with several of the antigens, and the reaction pattern was unique for each of the individuals. To certain antigens, all the salivas blotted bands if both clear and questionable bands were counted. Significantly more blotted bands were revealed with antigens from S. mutans than S. sobrinus. The results of the 3 different salivas of the same individual had a high degree of resemblance but in a few individuals, more blotted bands were obtained with parotid saliva to S. mutans and S. sobrinus antigens.
TI  - Characterization of the Streptococcus mutans GS-5 fruA gene encoding exo-beta-D-fructosidase.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence (5,010 bp) of the fructanase gene (fruA) and flanking regions of the chromosome of Streptococcus mutans GS-5 was determined. The fruA gene appears to be the sole transcript arising from a proximal promoter. The presumed precursor of the secreted FruA protein consists of 1,423 amino acids, and it has an M(r) of 158,656 and a pI of 4.82. The N terminus of FruA has characteristics in common with signal peptides of gram-positive organisms. The C terminus consists of a serine- and threonine-rich region, followed by the peptide LPDTGD, 4 charged amino acids, 21 amino acids with a strongly hydrophobic character, and a charged pentapeptide tail, which are proposed to correspond to the wall-spanning region, the LPXTGX consensus sequence, and the membrane-spanning domains of surface-associated proteins of gram-positive cocci. The FruA protein has significant homology with the Bacillus subtilis levanase (SacC), the Bacteroides fragilis levanase (ScrL), yeast invertases, and a number of other beta-fructosidases but not with fructosyltransferase, glucosyltransferases, or glucan-binding proteins of oral streptococci. Genes with homology to fruA were detected in S. mutans serotype c, e, and f strains, Streptococcus rattus, Streptococcus salivarius, and Streptococcus sanguis. A deletion derivative of FruA lacking the C-terminal 437 amino acids was still functional and could hydrolyze beta-(2,6)- and beta-(2,1)-linked sugars, but with altered preference for substrates. The data begin to define functional domains of the FruA protein and potential regulatory sites for induction, repression, growth rate control, and posttranslational localization of this multifunctional enzyme.
TI  - Enhancement of antimicrobial properties of cavity varnish: a preliminary report.
AB  - Bacterial contamination beneath amalgam restorations has been a problem in restorative dentistry. Cavity varnish improves the marginal seal but possesses no antibacterial properties, and chlorhexidine gluconate is a known antimicrobial substance. This study investigated the efficacy of a chlorhexidine gluconate/cavity varnish mixture against Streptococcus mutans, S. salivarius, and Escherichia coli. The in vitro results indicated that the addition of chlorhexidine gluconate to cavity varnish improved its antimicrobial properties.
TI  - Restricted distribution of Streptococcus milleri carbohydrate type antigens amongst other viridans streptococci.
AB  - The distribution of oral Streptococcus milleri carbohydrate type antigens in other viridans streptococcus species was examined. Rantz-Randall extracts of cells of the test strains grown in broth containing glucose were allowed to react with typing or grouping antisera for S. milleri serotypes a-k, or Lancefield groups A-G and K. Of 93 strains comprising more than 12 streptococcal species that included S. mutans and S. sanguis complexes, only 15 S. salivarius strains and one S. mitis strain were immunologically related to S. milleri serotype f. Unlike S. milleri strains, S. salivarius type f strains belonged to Lancefield group K, whereas the S. mitis strain was closely related to S. milleri serotype f but did not react with any of the Lancefield grouping antisera tested. Results suggest that oral S. milleri strains can be distinguished serologically from other oral viridans streptococci and that the typing antisera used in our researches might differentiate S. milleri isolates from the mouth from those associated with systemic purulent infections.
TI  - A comparison between commercial kits and conventional methods for enumeration of  salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli.
AB  - Mutans streptococci (ms) and lactobacilli levels were determined by conventional  and commercial dip-slide methods in three groups of young subjects, aged 5-6 years (93 subjects), 12-13 years (78 subjects) and 18-20 years (81 subjects). Using the same paraffin-stimulated saliva samples, ms and lactobacilli were estimated by conventional viable counts on modified mitis-salivarius agar (MSB) and Rogosa agar plates, and by inoculation of Dentocult SM and Dentocult LB dip-slides (Orion Diagnostica, Finland). The salivary ms and lactobacilli counts obtained from conventional agar plates were significantly correlated (P < 0.0001) with the dip-slide estimates of these organisms (Kendal Tau = 0.56, 0.71 respectively). Subjects in Group 2 showed the highest proportion (77 per cent) of individuals with salivary ms levels above 2.5 x 10(5) cfu/ml saliva; 99 per cent of that group had detectable levels of lactobacilli. Significantly different median salivary ms and lactobacilli levels were demonstrated between all groups except for lactobacilli levels between Groups 2 and 3. These dip-slide tests provided suitable and simple methods for screening salivary lactobacilli and ms levels which may have a useful role in the assessment of caries risk.
TI  - Expression of Streptococcus mutans gtf genes in Streptococcus milleri.
AB  - The Streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferase (GTF) genes gtfB and gtfC were ligated into Escherichia coli-streptococcus shuttle plasmids and introduced into Streptococcus milleri. gtfB transformant KSB8 formed an S. mutans-like rough colony on mitis salivarius agar and expressed an extracellular GTF-I, of 158 kDa, and two cell-bound GTF-Is, of 158 and 135 kDa. gtfC transformant KSC43 formed a semirough colony on mitis salivarius agar and expressed primarily an extracellular GTF-SI, of 146 kDa, and two cell-bound GTF-SIs, of 146 and 152 kDa. The extracellular GTFs from KSB8 and KSC43 were purified and characterized. The two types of GTF also reacted specifically with monoclonal antibodies directed against each enzyme. Both enzymes synthesized significant amounts of oligosaccharides, consisting primarily of alpha-1,6-glucosidic linkages, as well as water-insoluble glucans, containing alpha-1,3-glucosidic linkages. Insoluble-glucan-synthesizing activities of both enzymes were stimulated (three- to sixfold) by the addition of dextran T10 and were inhibited in the presence of 1.5 M ammonium sulfate. The Km(s) for sucrose and the optimal pHs were also similar for both enzymes. However, when the transformants were grown in Todd-Hewitt broth supplemented with sucrose, KSC43 cells, expressing GTF-SI activity, adhered to glass surfaces in vitro, while KSB8 cells, expressing GTF-I activity, did not. These results are discussed relative to the potential role of the gtfB and gftC genes in S. mutans cariogenicity.
TI  - [Morphologic and biochemical characteristics of viridans streptococci isolated from dental plaque].
AB  - The purposes of this study were to give the characteristics of viridans streptococci isolated from dental plaque, and the relationships with dental caries. We stained 69 patients' teeth on supragingival plaques (Plaque Index = 1) with the Pfiffer's reagent or FD&C RED#28 dye, then isolated 80 strains of oral streptococci from 69 patients. Cultures were grown in TSB, MS, and MSB media. A total of 80 fresh-isolated plaque streptococci, including strains of S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. mitis, and S. mutans were identified on the basis of morphologic, dark field, SEM, and biochemical characteristics. All of the oral plaque streptococci were to be found in significant percentages in dental plaque. Patients who had caries harboured S. mutans more often (37/40) than patients without caries (7/29). S. mutans comprised the greatest percentage (37/69) of microorganisms encountered in caries' plaque, and there was an association between high counts of S. mutans and the presence of dental caries. Cultural and biochemical methods were used for the isolation and identification of the different species of S. mutans. The result indicated that biotype I were the most predominant species (50%) in dental plaque. Thus, it is possible to isolate, screen and identify unknown strains through the morphologic, darkfield, SEM, and biochemical characteristics of viridans streptococci isolated from human dental plaque. By means of the present methods for identification, we hold considerable promises for contributing to the prevention and diagnosis of dental diseases.
TI  - Multibacterial artificial plaque. A model for studying carious process.
AB  - A multibacterial artificial plaque was established in vitro on enamel slabs incubated in mixed culture of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans (serotype c), Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus casei and Actinomyces viscosus. Typical structure same as natural plaque was seen under microscope. The caries-like lesion produced under the plaque was observed in enamel sections. The lesion was similar in appearance to natural ones under optic and scanning electron microscopes. The acids produced in both culture media and artificial plaque were similar in composition and type to those produced in natural plaque after sugar attack. It is suggested that this kind of plaque model may be useful in studying carious process in vitro, because it is easily controlled either by changing the composition of bacteria or by adding different kinds of nutrient in the media. Moreover, the results will be easier to explain than those produced in natural ones.
TI  - A scheme for the identification of viridans streptococci.
AB  - A collection of strains representing all the currently recognised species of oral or viridans streptococci (Streptococcus sanguis, S. parasanguis, S. gordonii, S. oralis, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. vestibularis, S. anginosus, S. constellatus, s. intermedius, S. mutans and S. sobrinus) were tested for the production of a range of glycosidase activities with 4-methylumbelliferyl-linked fluorogenic substrates, and for reactions in a range of conventional fermentation and hydrolytic tests. The resulting biochemical scheme, consisting of 14 tests, enabled the differentiation of all these species and distinguished three biotypes within S. sanguis. The scheme reported here represents an improvement over currently available schemes for the identification of viridans streptococci.
TI  - Molecular characterization of a cluster of at least two glucosyltransferase genes in Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 25975.
AB  - The oral micro-organism Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 25975 synthesizes extracellular glucosyltransferases (GTFs) which polymerize the glucose moiety of sucrose into glucan polymers. Two separate genes encoding the activities of a GTF-I (a GTF that synthesizes an insoluble product) and a GTF-S (a GTF that synthesizes soluble product) were cloned into bacteriophage lambda L47.1. The inserts in the lambda-clones were characterized by restriction mapping and Southern hybridization and were found to overlap, implying that the two genes lay very close to one another on the S. salivarius chromosome. Both genes were subcloned into phagemid vector pIBI30 where they were expressed at a high level. The GTF-I-encoding gene was named gtfJ and the GTF-S-encoding gene, gtfK. Nucleotide sequencing showed that gtfJ and most probably gtfK were closely related to the gtf genes of the mutans streptococci. Sequence alignment also indicated that gtfK lay very close to and downstream from gtfJ, and that both were transcribed in the same direction.
TI  - Enumeration of oral streptococci on media containing different concentrations of  sodium and potassium ions.
AB  - Laboratory "type" strains of oral streptococci were screened for their ability to grow on mitis-salivarius agar (MSA) in the presence of increasing concentrations of either Na+ or K+ up to 500 mmol/L. Strains were generally better able to withstand increasing concentrations of Na+ than K+, although low numbers of colony-forming units (cfus) were seen with the highest concentration of either cation. Two strains of Streptococcus mutans, Ingbritt 162 and Ingbritt 175, behaved differently when the concentration of cation was increased from 50 to 200 mmol/L; the latter showed a marked increase in the number of cfus when the Na+ concentration was increased from 50 to 200 mmol/L, whereas there was a decrease with strain Ingbritt 162. Strains of oral streptococci from the saliva of adults and children were isolated on modified MSA containing known concentrations of Na+ and K+ and further examined if they showed "mutans-like" colony morphology. The number of cfus generally dropped as the concentration of Na+ or K+ was increased from 200 to 350 or 500 mmol/L. Greater numbers of streptococci were tolerant to Na+ than to K+. Half of the isolates were members of the Streptococcus sanguis group (SSG), either Streptococcus mitis or S. sanguis II, and these were more tolerant to high concentrations of Na+ or K+ than other isolates that were identified as Streptococcus morbillorum, Streptococcus acidominimus, and Streptococcus milleri.
TI  - Human leukocyte antigens in relation to colonization by mutans streptococci in the oral cavity.
AB  - Mutans streptococci are well established as caries-inducing microorganisms in man. Most humans carry the bacteria, but in highly different numbers. This cannot be explained by environmental factors only. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible association between levels of colonization by mutans streptococci and the presence of certain B and DR human leukocyte antigens (HLA). Altogether, 170 subjects who had their HLA antigens determined (76 renal transplant patients and 94 healthy blood donors) were selected for the investigation. Paraffin-stimulated saliva samples were taken using the wooden spatula method with subsequent cultivation of mutans streptococci on mitis salivarius bacitracin agar plates. An association between the absence of HLA-DR 4 antigens and low, or undetectable, levels of mutans streptococci was found. This was statistically significant for the immunosuppressed renal transplant subjects. The same trend was observed among the healthy blood donors.
TI  - A modified mitis salivarius medium for a caries diagnostic test.
AB  - A new medium, MSKB, composed of mitis salivarius agar base, sorbitol, kanamycin sulfate and bacitracin, has been developed that is more selective for recovery of mutans streptococci (mutans) than the so called mitis salivarius bacitracin (MSB) medium. MSB and MSKB were compared for recovery and selectivity of mutans by plating saliva samples as well as pure cultures on both media. Sixty saliva samples were plated and counted for mutans and non-mutans colonies. Thirty-six samples had greater numbers of non-mutans on MSB than on MSKB, and 14 of the 36 had non-mutans colonies that could be visually confused with mutants. The recovery of mutans on MSKB was approximately 13% less than on MSB. The selectivity and recovery of MSB and MSKB were evaluated over 1-5 months of storage at 4 degrees C. Streptococcus anginosus grew on MSB after 1 month, but not on MSKB. Streptococcus milleri type 2 grew on both media after 4 months.
TI  - Comparative antibacterial effects of chlorhexidine and stannous fluoride-amine fluoride containing dental gels against salivary mutans streptococci.
AB  - Forty-five young adults were divided into three groups of equal size and given a  professional toothcleaning (3 times during 1 wk) with dental gels containing either chlorhexidine (CHX, 1%), or a SnF2-amine fluoride (AmF) combination (F- content 1.20%). The control group received toothcleaning with a placebo gel. The study was done double blind. The number of salivary mutans streptococci was monitored for 11 wk after the gel treatment using both mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar plates and the chairside method based on the adhesion of mutans streptococci on plastic strips (Dentocult-SM Strip mutans). Professional toothcleaning with a CHX gel was clearly most effective (P less than 0.001) but the baseline levels of streptococci returned in 11 wk. SnF2-AmF gel also reduced significantly (P less than 0.001) mutans streptococci but recolonization occurred already in 7 wk. Placebo gel, i.e. professional toothcleaning as such, did not show any statistically significant effect on the numbers of salivary mutans streptococci. None of the treatments affected the levels of lactobacilli or the total aerobic flora in saliva samples. Professional toothcleaning with a CHX gel, or with a SnF2-AmF gel, can be regarded as an alternative to the commonly used, but more patience demanding, application of gel in mouth trays at home for individuals with high caries activity.
TI  - Intrageneric structure of Streptococcus based on comparative analysis of small-subunit rRNA sequences.
AB  - The partial 16S rRNA sequences of 24 Streptococcus species were determined by reverse transcription. A comparative analysis of these sequences and the sequences of seven previously studied streptococcal species revealed the presence of several clusters within the genus. The clusters obtained from the sequence analysis agreed in general with the groups outlined on the basis of the results of nucleic acid hybridization studies, but there were some exceptions. The pyogenic group was extended to include Streptococcus agalactiae, S. parauberis, S. porcinus, and S. uberis. Four oral groups were discerned; these four groups centered on S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. anginosus, and S. oralis. Some species (e.g., S. suis and S. acidominimus) did not cluster with any particular group. Our findings are discussed in the context of data from other genetic and chemotaxonomic studies.
TI  - Caries experience, periodontal treatment needs, salivary pH, and Streptococcus mutans counts in a preadolescent Down syndrome population.
AB  - The prevalence of dental caries and periodontal treatment needs in an institutionalized population with Down syndrome was examined and the relationship between caries prevalence, salivary pH, and salivary levels of Streptococcus mutans was studied. Thirty-two children with Down syndrome, aged 8 to 13, were compared with two control groups of similar age ranges: healthy children and non-Down mentally retarded (MR) children living in the same institution as the Down syndrome population. The gender ratio mixtures in each group also matched the study sample. Caries experience as indicated by decayed, missing, and filled surfaces (DMF-S) showed significantly lower mean scores for the Down syndrome group compared with both control groups. A similar pattern was found when evaluating the mean numbers of decayed surfaces. Streptococcus mutans counts, expressed as number of colony-forming units on mitis salivarius agar plates among the Down syndrome group, were the lowest, although not statistically significant compared with the counts of the healthy children. Both groups had bacterial counts which were significantly lower than those of the MR group. Significant differences between the two institutionalized groups and the healthy group were recorded for the salivary pH levels. The periodontal treatment needs as evaluated by the Community Periodontal Index of Treatment Needs showed significant difference between the MR group versus both the healthy population and the Down syndrome group. On the whole, 84% of the Down syndrome children were cariesfree.
TI  - Effects of a 1% chlorhexidine gel on the cariogenic bacteria in high-risk elders: a pilot study.
AB  - Root caries in dentate elderly patients is a problem which may be controlled with chlorhexidine. The purpose of this pilot study was to establish the extent and duration of the antimicrobial effects from an intensive regimen of a 1% chlorhexidine gel in institutionalized elders who had experienced high caries activity in the previous year. Stimulated saliva samples from all subjects before treatment produced more than 105 colony forming units/milliliters of Streptococcus mutans (mean: 2.0 x 10(7); s.d.: 2.0 x 10(7)) when diluted and cultured on Mitus Salivarius-bacitracin agar for 48 hours. Findings suggest that daily treatments for 1 week with a 1% chlorhexidine gel can reduce the number of cariogenic bacteria in elderly people for approximately 3 weeks after treatment.
TI  - The presence of two forms of the phosphocarrier protein HPr of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system in streptococci.
AB  - The protein, HPr, a necessary component of the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (PTS) in bacteria, was purified from Streptococcus salivarius by column chromatography. The purified preparation gave only one band when analyzed by sodium dodecylsulfate gel electrophoresis or by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel (pI = 4.85). However, electrophoresis in Tris-containing buffers under non-denaturing conditions revealed 2 bands that could be phosphorylated by PEP in the presence of enzyme I of the PTS or by ATP with the HPr kinase. Homogeneous preparations of these 2 forms could be obtained by preparative electrophoresis. Each preparation exhibited only 1 band when analyzed by electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions, indicating that the doublet observed before preparative electrophoresis was not an electrophoretic artefact. The electrophoretic mobility of each protein was not modified following heat-treatment at 100 degrees C for 20 min or storage at -40 degrees C for several months. Both HPr proteins catalyzed in vitro the PEP-dependent phosphorylation of glucose, but at a rate slightly lower than that observed with a preparation of HPr containing both forms of the protein. Both forms were also able to transfer the phosphate group from PEP to the other specific PTS proteins known in S salivarius. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against each form reacted with both proteins. The presence of the 2 forms of HPr was detected in fresh cellular extracts of S salivarius; however, their intracellular ratio varied according to growth conditions. A doublet was also found in many other streptococcal species tested (S mutans, S sobrinus, S sanguis, S thermophilus, S bovis, S rattus) and also in L lactis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Effect of calcium ions on cell surface electrostatics of Bacteroides gingivalis and other oral bacteria.
AB  - Surface electrostatics of Bacteroides gingivalis and other oral bacteria were examined. A polarization circuit was employed using platinum electrodes exposed in each bacterial suspension and the number of bacteria adsorbed to the anode and cathode were then estimated. In all bacteria (B. gingivalis, Streptococcus sobrinus, S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. sanguis and Actinomyces viscosus), the number of cells adsorbed to the anode were much greater than the number of cells adsorbed to the cathode. Treating these bacteria with calcium ions tended to decrease the ratio of the number of cells adsorbed to the anode to the number of cells adsorbed to the cathode in all bacteria examined. Moreover, in the case of B. gingivalis, the number of cells adsorbed to the anode and cathode was in an inverse relationship to the number counted before calcium ion treatment. These findings indicate that the cell surfaces of oral bacteria are generally negatively charged but only the cell surface electrostatics of B. gingivalis was dramatically affected by calcium ion treatment. Thus, divalent metal bridges such as calcium bridges contribute to the adherence of the periodontopathic bacterium, B. gingivalis rather than to that of other oral bacteria including cariogenic bacteria.
TI  - [Non-groupable streptococci: identification, sensitivity to antibiotics (Charles  Nicolle Hospital in Tunis)].
AB  - 50 strains of viridans streptococci isolated from human material are identified by biochemical tests (bile esculin, Cl Na 6,5%, acid production from lactose, mannitol, sorbitol, inulin, arginine, esculin and starch hydrolysis; production of levan and dextran in sucrose media) Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus mitis are predominant species. Susceptibility to antibiotics was studied: 70% of viridans streptococci were susceptible to all antibiotics tested, high level resistance to aminoglycoside was not present. The only resistance observed were to tetracycline, macrolides and related drugs.
TI  - Mutacin activity of strains isolated from children with varying levels of mutants streptococci and caries.
AB  - A total of 157 isolates of mutants streptococci from plaque and saliva of 94 children were studied for their serotypes, mutacin production, frequency and spectrum of activity. Of these isolates 71% were identified as serotype c and 22% as serotype e. Serotypes f, d and g, and one untypable strain made up about 7% of the isolates. More than one serotype was found in 13% of the children. Mutacin was produced by 83% of the isolates against one or more of the 14 indicator strains representing mutants streptococci. Streptococcus sanguis, Strep. oralis, Strep. gordonii, Strep. salivarius and Strep. pyogenes. Isolates that had a broad inhibitory spectrum also produced larger inhibition zones than isolates that inhibited fewer strains. When evaluating the effect of mutacin in vivo on plaque ecology, it was found that the counts of mutans streptococci or the proportion of mutans streptococci in the total streptococcal count of plaque did not differ between plaques containing strains that produced much mutacin and those with little production. The findings also failed to reveal an association between caries experience and mutacin activity.
TI  - Effect of immune bovine milk on Streptococcus mutans in human dental plaque.
AB  - The use of a mouthrinse of bovine milk containing antibodies to Streptococcus mutans resulted in an initial reduction in the numbers of recoverable Strep. mutans in a group of 9 individuals. Ten volunteers who used control bovine milk that contained no antibody activity to Strep. mutans had variable levels of plaque Strep. mutans. In addition, after culture on Mitis Salivarius and Gold's agar, the plaque Strep. mutans from subjects who used the immune bovine milk rinse formed smaller colonies than those from pre-treatment plaque and from all plaque samples of subjects who used the control rinse.
TI  - [The antimicrobial efficiency of aqueous solutions of calcium hydroxide on Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus faecalis and Candida albicans, in vitro].
AB  - Calcium hydroxide preparations Ca(OH)2 are used as water solutions, putly, liner, cement or artificial material. The therapeutic effect of each medicaments depends on physical and chemical characteristic of additional components. The aim of the paper is to research the sensitivity of Streptococcus faecalis and Candida albicans to different water solution concentrations of calcium hydroxide. As solid plates, Bacto-Mitis-Salivarius agar was used for S. mutans, Torlak blood agar for S. faecalis and Sabourand agar "Torlak" for C. albicans. The holes were drilled in solid plates and were filled by 0.2 ml of water solutions of Ca(OH)2. Preparations, created as described were incubated aerobically at 37 degrees C in the period of 48 hrs. Results were read after 24 as well as after 48 hrs. The examined solutions of Ca(OH)2, revealed the highest antimicrobic effect after 24 hrs. The result remained unchanged even after 48 hrs. The inhibition of S. mutans growth on the solid plate occurred with the concentration of Ca(OH)2 solution from 271.18 x 10(-2) mol/dm3 and pH 12.76. The growth of S. faecalis at the solid plate was inhibited with the concentration of 3335.21 x 10(-3) mol/dm3 and pH 12.82. The inhibition of C. albicans growth on solid plate occurred with the concentration of Ca(OH)2 solution from 1023.20 x 10(-3) mol/dm3 and pH 12.84. The difference in the sensitivity of the examined microorganisms at the same concentrations of Ca(OH)2 solution was observed.
TI  - Ability to bind salivary alpha-amylase discriminates certain viridans group streptococcal species.
AB  - A collection of 144 viridans group streptococcal strains recently characterized as part of a taxonomic study was examined for the ability to bind salivary alpha-amylase. This property was found in most strains of Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus mitis and in occasional strains of Streptococcus anginosus and Streptococcus salivarius. In contrast, all strains of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus vestibularis, and Streptococcus mutans lacked alpha-amylase-binding capacity. A rapid and easy assay described in this paper may be an important supplementary test for identification of oral streptococci.
TI  - A IIIman protein is involved in the transport of glucose, mannose and fructose by oral streptococci.
AB  - We show in this article that the transport of glucose, mannose and fructose by the phosphoenolpyruvate: mannose phosphotransferase system of oral streptococci requires the participation of a protein component that we have called IIIman. This protein was purified from Streptococcus salivarius by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, DEAE-TSK, hydroxyapatite, and Dyematrex Green A. The purified protein migrated as a 38,900 molecular weight protein on a sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel. However, electrophoretic analysis of phosphoproteins and Western blot experiments indicated the presence in membrane-free cellular extracts of S. salivarius of 2 different forms of IIIman having molecular weights of 38,900 and 35,200. The presence of the high-molecular-weight form of IIIman was observed by immunodiffusion, Western blot and phosphorylation by [32]PEP in S. salivarius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, and Streptococcus lactis but not in Streptococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus casei. Antibodies directed against the IIIman of S. salivarius did not react with the IIIman of Escherichia coli.
TI  - [The microbiological aspects of dental caries: the evaluation of a protocol for isolating Streptococcus mutans].
AB  - The role of Streptococcus mutans in the etiopathogenesis of dental caries to set  up a protocol for the culture and the identification of the bacterium, in order to obtain the isolation in an heterogeneous age, sex and stomatognathic population is described. A selected culture medium for mutans, Mitis Salivarius agar enriched with Bacitracin (MSB-agar), has been used as well as biochemical method based on carbohydrates fermentation by amplified bacterial flora for the identification of the bacterial genus.
TI  - [Oral Streptococci - a scheme for the identification of Streptococcus mutans].
AB  - A reliable simple scheme for the rapid identification of certain species of oral  streptococci has been developed and compared with biochemical and physiological results of 45 well known clinical isolates and stock strains. Moreover, a method for the determination of H2O2 production was tested. With selected reactions as for instance acid formation in mannitol and raffinose broth, hydrolysis of arginine and esculin, the production of peroxidase, and the resistance of bacitracin the species S. rattus, S. sobrinus, S. mutans, S. cricetus, S. ferus, S. milleri, S. mitis, S. sanguis, S. mitior, and S. salivarius were differentiated.
TI  - Direct observations of cooperative effects in oral streptococcal adhesion to glass by analysis of the spatial arrangement of adhering bacteria.
AB  - The spatial arrangement of two strains of oral bacteria adhering on glass was studied in order to investigate cooperative effects in their adhesion mechanisms. Streptococcus salivarius HB was a strain which possessed several classes of fibrillar surface appendages, whereas on the cell surface of S. mutants NS no surface appendages could be identified. The bacteria were deposited from a flowing suspension with various buffer concentrations on the bottom glass plate of a parallel plate flow cell and were observed directly with a video camera mounted on a phase contrast microscope. The positions of all adhering bacteria were determined by means of automated real time image analysis and subsequently employed for calculating radial and angular pair distribution functions. Pair distribution functions indicate the average relative number density of bacteria around one deposited bacterium as a function of the radial distance or the angular orientation relative to the flow direction. From the calculated pair distribution functions of both bacterial strains it was concluded that cooperative effects contributed to the adhesion of S. salivarius HB, but not to adhesion of S. mutants NS. It was suggested that these cooperative effects originate from the surface appendages of S. salivarius HB.
TI  - Sialidase activity of the "Streptococcus milleri group" and other viridans group  streptococci.
AB  - Viridans group streptococci were examined for the production of sialidase (neuraminidase) activity, using the fluorescent substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid in a simple and rapid (15-min) assay. Sialidase was produced by all strains of Streptococcus oralis and S. intermedius and by a majority of S. mitis strains. S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. gordonii, S. sanguis, S. vestibularis, S. salivarius, S. anginosus, S. constellatus, "S. parasanguis," and the "tufted fibril group" were uniformly negative. Sialidase production may be a useful characteristic to assist in the identification of viridans group streptococci.
TI  - Effect of TiF4 solutions on bacterial growth in vitro and on tooth surfaces.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the antimicrobial effect of TiF4 as compared with equimolar solutions of NaF, APF, and SnF2 and to evaluate the effect, if any, on bacterial growth on topically treated tooth surfaces. In an in vitro study, paper discs impregnated with 20 microliters of equimolar solutions of SnF2, NaF, APF, and TiF4 were placed on blood agar plates seeded with Streptococcus mutans and Bacteroides gingivalis. Sterile saline was used as control. Similar growth inhibition zones were found for all fluorides. In the second part of the study six volunteers carried intraoral appliances containing enamel and root surface specimens treated with 1% TiF4 and untreated specimens for 18 h. Scanning electron microscopic examination of the experimental tooth surfaces showed great variation in bacterial growth between subjects, but no systematic difference between fluoride-treated and untreated specimens. Bacteria from test and control specimens were grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions on blood agar and on mitis salivarius agar. Colony-forming unit counts showed great interindividual variations, but no differences could be observed between treated and untreated enamel or root surfaces. Thus, the hypothesis that the presence of a Ti-rich coating may influence bacterial colonization on TiF4-treated tooth surfaces could not be substantiated.
TI  - Coaggregation of Streptococcus sanguis and other streptococci with Candida albicans.
AB  - Thirteen strains of viridans group streptococci and two strains of other streptococci were tested for coaggregation with Candida albicans. Streptococcus sanguis strains generally exhibited low levels of adherence to 28 degrees C-grown exponential-phase yeast cells, but starvation of yeast cells for glucose at 37 degrees C (or at 28 degrees C) increased their coaggregating activity with these streptococci by at least tenfold. This was a property common to four C. albicans strains tested, two of which were able to form mycelia (6406 and MEN) and two of which were not (MM2002 and CA2). The expression of the coaggregation adhesin during yeast cell starvation was inhibited by addition of trichodermin or amphotericin B. The strains of S. sanguis, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus oralis tested for coaggregating activity encompassed a diverse range of physiological and morphological types, yet all exhibited saturable coaggregation with starved C. albicans cells. There was no correlation of cell surface hydrophobicity, of either yeast or streptococcal cells, with their abilities to coaggregate. Strains of Streptococcus anginosus also coaggregated with starved yeast cells; Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus pyogenes coaggregated to a lesser degree with C. albicans, and the coaggregation with S. pyogenes was not promoted by yeast cell starvation; Streptococcus mutans and Enterococcus faecalis did not coaggregate with yeast. The coaggregation reactions of S. sanguis and S. gordonii with C. albicans were inhibited by EDTA and by heat or protease treatment of the yeast cells and were not reversible by the addition of lactose or other simple sugars. These observations extend the range of intergeneric coaggregations that are known to occur between oral microbes and suggest that coaggregations of C. albicans with viridans group streptococci may be important for colonization of oral surfaces by the yeast.
TI  - Efficacy of chlorhexidine and sanguinarine mouthrinses on selected salivary microflora.
AB  - The antibacterial effects of chlorhexidine and sanguinarine on selected salivary  microflora were evaluated in 15 healthy young adults. The experiment was performed in a cross-over manner enabling both mouthrinses and the saline control to be tested on all 15 subjects for periods of one week separated by three week intervals. The total bacterial count and selected bacterial genera were followed in saliva samples taken just before the first rinse, and on three occasions after the last rinse. Statistically significant reductions in the salivary levels of S. mutans and S. salivarius were obtained with chlorhexidine but not with sanguinarine, and rinsing twice a day with sanguinarine, according to the manufacturer's instructions, did not significantly reduce the total bacterial count. Additional well controlled, longer-term studies are required before any firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the effect of sanguinarine on salivary microorganisms.
TI  - Effect of chlorhexidine-sodium fluoride gel applied by tray or by toothbrush on salivary mutans streptococci.
AB  - A chlorhexidine (1%)-sodium fluoride (0.2%) gel applied using a dental tray six times during two consecutive days significantly decreased salivary levels of mutans streptococci but had only a slight effect on salivary levels of lactobacilli. The same gel used as a dentifrice for one week (twice a day) also significantly reduced salivary levels of mutans streptococci. However, this treatment was somewhat less effective than that using trays, on the basis of the ratio of mutans streptococci to total aerobes. With both treatments baseline salivary levels of mutans streptococci were re-attained after 70 days. One day after the gel treatment, mutans streptococci were unable to adhere to plastic strips (Dentocult SM Strip mutans) but detectable growth was found on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. This suggests that not only are numbers of mutans streptococci reduced after chlorhexidine-sodium fluoride gel treatment but also mutans streptococci adherence.
TI  - Cohesion between oral streptococci and Neisseria pharyngis on saliva-coated glass, in the presence and absence of sucrose.
AB  - Ten strains of oral streptococci, comprising nine species, were screened for their in vitro cohesive interactions with a freshly isolated strain of Neisseria pharyngis. Strains of mutans streptococci, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis I, Streptococcus milleri and Streptococcus mitis were able to cohere with N. pharyngis cells attached to a salivary pellicle adsorbed to glass. The cohesion was either due to coaggregation between the different genera or modification of the salivary pellicle by N. pharyngis MW2. S. sanguis II and Streptococcus oralis strains could not cohere with the N. pharyngis strain. Extracellular polysaccharide formed from sucrose was found to mediate cohesion between certain strains of mutans streptococci or S. oralis and N. pharyngis MW2.
TI  - Comparison of the initial streptococcal microflora on dental enamel in caries-active and in caries-inactive individuals.
AB  - This study compared the initial (4 h) microflora on enamel in 7 caries-active and in 7 caries-inactive adolescents. In both groups the microflora was dominated by streptococci which comprised 61 and 78% (median values) of the total viable counts in caries-active and caries-inactive individuals, respectively (p less than 0.01). Identification of a total of 700 streptococcal isolates according to a recently revised classification showed that the predominant streptococci belonged to the species Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis biovar 1, and Streptococcus sanguis. Early plaque from caries-inactive individuals differed from that of caries-active individuals by significantly higher proportions of S. sanguis (p less than 0.05) and IgA1 protease producing streptococci (p less than 0.05). In caries-active individuals, there was a tendency to elevated levels of S. mitis biovar 1 (p less than 0.10). In addition, caries-active individuals were colonized by significantly higher numbers of mutans streptococci on the enamel surfaces (p less than 0.01). However, in both groups Streptococcus mutans (serotype c) comprised less than or equal to 2% of the early streptococcal flora. Streptococcus gordonii, S. mitis biovar 2, and Streptococcus salivarius were present in low proportions and did not show differences in distribution that could be related to caries activity. The observed differences in the composition of the early streptococcal microflora may be a factor that governs the eventual cariogenic potential of dental plaque.
TI  - [The effect of zinc chloride mouthwashes on caries-inducing plaque streptococci.  3. The antibacterial effect of zinc chloride on the species Str. mutans, Str. sanguis and Str. salivarius in dental plaque].
AB  - The quantitative behaviour of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus salivarius has been examined in initial findings and after application of 0.4% zinc chloride solution. After a 7 day rinsing the number of colony developing units of the species Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis in the plaque decreased to about 30% of the determined initial values. The proportions of the species Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis in the total streptococcus flora of the dental plaque were not changed by zinc chloride solution. The percentage of the Streptococcus salivarius increased significantly from 1% to 4% of the total number of streptococci.
TI  - [The effect of zinc chloride mouthwashes on caries-inducing plaque streptococci.  1. In vitro research on the antimicrobial efficacy of zinc chloride on reference strains of Streptococcus mutans (BHT), Streptococcus sanguis (HKop) and Streptococcus salivarius (NCTN 8618)].
AB  - The antimicrobial efficiency of zinc chloride solution in concentration from 0.1% to 2.0% and 0.2% chlorhexidine solution has been examined on the strains of reference in a comparative study. Three test methods were applied: the agar diffusion test, the dilution test and the suspension test. As was to be expected the antibacterial effect of the zinc chloride solution was dependent on concentration. Between 0.1% and 2.0% the zinc chloride solution showed a bacteriostatic effect on the strains of reference only; the application of higher concentrated solutions is not indicated intraorally. 0.2% chlorhexidine solution showed a bactericidal effect on the test germs.
TI  - Saliva-induced aggregation of oral streptococci and the influence of blood group  reactive substances.
AB  - Aggregation of strains of Streptococcus rattus, Strep. mutans and Strep. salivarius by saliva from individuals of blood groups A, B and O was investigated. Blood group A salivas had a significantly higher aggregation activity with Strep. rattus than blood group B salivas (P less than 0.05). However, Strep. mutans and Strep. salivarius were better aggregated by blood group B saliva and this was significant for Strep. mutans (P less than 0.05). For all three strains, the variance within blood group O was too large to give significant differences with either blood group A or B. The blood group A-specific carbohydrate, N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, inhibited aggregation of Strep. rattus, but not of the other strains. The blood group B-specific carbohydrate, D-galactose, inhibited aggregation of Strep. mutans but not of Strep. rattus or Strep. salivarius. L-Fucose, specific for blood group O failed to inhibit aggregation of any of the three strains. These findings suggest that blood group-specific substances may be involved in bacterial aggregation.
TI  - Properties of a phosphocarrier protein (HPr) extracted from intact cells of Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - Cells of Streptococcus sanguis strain Challis were incubated with sodium lauroylsarcosinate to extract surface proteins. A polypeptide of apparent molecular mass 16 kDa comprising about 12% of the extract was purified using anion-exchange chromatography. The polypeptide was shown to be a phosphocarrier protein (HPr) that could also be found in the soluble (cytoplasmic) fraction from cells broken by homogenization with glass beads. In vivo labelling of S. sanguis cells with 32Pi showed that the polypeptide carried a heat- and acid-stable phosphorylation and that during sucrose starvation the HPr became dephosphorylated. Antiserum raised to the S. sanguis HPr reacted on Western blots with HPrs from all oral streptococci tested, together with strains of S. pyogenes and S. salivarius, but not with HPrs from S. faecalis or S. bovis, nor with proteins from Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Actinomyces viscosus and various lactobacilli. The S. sanguis HPr had a high content of alanine (17.2%) and was similar in overall amino acid composition to the HPrs from S. mutans an S. salivarius. The N-terminal residues (to 37) of the S. sanguis HPr showed strong sequence identity (82%) with the N-terminal sequence of S. faecalis HPr. It is suggested that HPr in S. sanguis is associated closely with the cytoplasmic membrane. Non-disruptive methods of removing cell-surface proteins from streptococci effect release of HPr and possibly other cytoplasmic components.
TI  - Streptococcus mutans, not detected?
AB  - The growth of Streptococcus mutans was followed for three years in 24 healthy 12-17 year-old children, who were selected for the study on the basis of undetectable levels of salivary S. mutans. The saliva samples were cultured by a dip-slide method based on mitis-salivarius agar supplemented with sucrose and bacitracin. At the final occasion, additional examination of plaque and saliva of 10 children using TSY20B agar was performed. During the 3-year study period, S. mutans was found in saliva samples from 15 children on one or more of the 4 test occasions, suggesting that most 'S. mutans negative individuals' were those in whom S. mutans could not be temporarily detected. The additional examination of plaque did not increase the number of 'S. mutans-positive individuals'.
TI  - Molecular surface characterization of oral streptococci by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
AB  - In order to characterize the molecular composition of oral streptococci, infrared transmission spectroscopy on freeze-dried cells dissolved in KBr was used. All infrared spectra show similar absorption bands for the strains studied with the most important absorption bands located at 2930 cm-1 (CH), 1653 cm-1 (AmI), 1541 cm-1 (AmII) and two bands at 1236 cm-1 and 1082 cm-1, which were assigned to phosphate and sugar groups. However, calculation of absorption band ratios normalized with respect to the integrated intensity of the CH stretching region around 2930 cm-1, show significant differences between the strains. Both Streptococcus mitis strains possess high AmI/CH and AmII/CH absorption band ratios compared to the other strains. Streptococcus salivarius HBC12, a mutant strain devoid of all proteinaceous surface appendages, shows significantly lower AmI/CH and AmII/CH band ratios with respect to its parent strain S. salivarius HB. Two positive relationships could be established both between the AmII/CH absorption band ratio and the N/C elemental surface concentration ratio of the strains previously, determined from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and also between AmI/CH and the fraction of carbon atoms at the surface involved in amide bonds, determined by XPS as well. From this comparison, it is concluded that transmission infrared spectroscopy can be employed as a technique to study the molecular surface composition of freeze-dried microorganisms.
TI  - A physiological classification of viridans streptococci by use of the API-20STREP system.
AB  - Physiological reactions of viridans streptococci were examined by the API-20STREP system and a selection of conventional tests. Cluster analysis of these results produced a classification similar to a taxonomic scheme based on that of Colman and Williams. The organisms could be divided into the six recognised species--Streptococcus mutans, S. bovis, S. mitior, S. sanguis, S. salivarius and S. milleri. Analysis confirmed that S. mitior and S. sanguis can be distinguished in the API-20STREP test by hydrolysis of arginine but not by dextran production. Although S. mutans, S. mitior and S. sanguis can be divided into two further subgroups, the taxonomic significance of this is unclear. With this means of classification, most organisms could be identified easily by a small number of tests. API-20STREP is convenient for performing physiological tests on viridans streptococci, but the information provided by the manufacturers in regard to identification and nomenclature is in need of revision.
TI  - Cariogenicity of a lactate dehydrogenase-deficient mutant of Streptococcus mutans serotype c in gnotobiotic rats.
AB  - A lactate dehydrogenase-deficient (Ldh-) mutant of a human isolate of Streptococcus mutans serotype c was tested in a gnotobiotic rat caries model. Compared with the wild-type Ldh-positive (Ldh+) strains, it was significantly (alpha less than or equal to 0.005) less cariogenic in experiments with two different sublines of Sprague-Dawley rats. The Ldh- mutant strain 044 colonized the oral cavity of the test animals to the same extent as its parent strain 041, although its initial implantation was slightly but not significantly (P greater than or equal to 0.2) less. Multiple oral or fecal samples plated on 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium indicator medium revealed no evidence of back mutation from Ldh- to Ldh+ in vivo. Both Ldh+ strain 041 and Ldh- strain 044 demonstrated bacteriocinlike activity in vitro against a number of human strains of mutans streptococci representing serotype a (S. cricetus) and serotypes c and e (S. mutans). Serotypes b (S. rattus) and f (S. mutans) and strains of S. mitior, S. sanguis, and S. salivarius were not inhibited. Thus, Ldh mutant strain 044 possesses a number of desirable traits that suggest it should be investigated further as a possible effector strain for replacement therapy of dental caries. These traits include its stability and low cariogenicity in the sensitive gnotobiotic rat caries model, its bacteriocinlike activity against certain other cariogenic S. mutans (but not against more inocuous indigenous oral streptococci), and the fact that it is a member of the most prevalent human serotype of cariogenic streptococci.
TI  - Invasion of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus salivarius in early caries lesions of gnotobiotic rats.
AB  
TI  - [Adherence test in relation to caries activity].
AB  - The amount of streptococcus mutans in saliva has been suggested as a way of estimating caries activity (Klock; Krasse, 1979; Newbrum et al 1984; Sabelli, 1985; Thylstrop; Fejerskov, 1988). This study was carried out no evaluate the relationship between an adherence test (formation of streptococcus mutans colonies which allows to group individuals according to level of risk) with the caries activity was determine in 137 children and samples of saliva (0.1 ml) were obtained from each of them. They were processed in mitis salivarius sucrose al 37 degrees C. during 48 hours. According to the reaching each child caries activity was recorded as percentage of non-active caries in the mean values in each group were statistically analyzed using Kramer's extension of Duncan's test. Significant differences were found only between high and low level risk groups. In the care of extreme groups the test seems to be valuable form estimation of caries activity.
TI  - Effect of zeta potential and surface energy on bacterial adhesion to uncoated and saliva-coated human enamel and dentin.
AB  - Physicochemical surface characteristics of early plaque-forming bacteria and of human tooth surfaces were measured to establish their role in bacterial adhesion to intact dental tissue slabs. In addition, the influence of an experimental salivary pellicle was evaluated. Strains of S. mutans, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, A. viscosus, and A. odontolyticus showed relatively high surface free energies (range, 99-128 mJ.m-2) and carried a negative surface charge, at both physiological (mu = 0.057) and low (mu = 0.020) ionic strengths of the medium. Very large differences in hydrophobicity were detected when the hexadecane adsorption test was used for measurement. Powdered enamel and dentin were also negatively charged at low ionic strength but were slightly positively charged in the physiological buffer. The surface free energy of enamel and dentin increased upon saliva coating, whereas the surface charge was always negative. The adhesion experiments showed: (1) large differences in the binding of various bacteria to the same surface; (2) an up to 20-fold difference in the binding of the same bacterium to different surfaces, although the binding of some strains was relatively independent of the type of surface or presence of a salivary pellicle; (3) a significant decrease in adhesion when the ionic strength of the medium was lowered, due to increased electrostatic repulsion (however, the adhesion of some bacteria was independent of the ionic strength of the medium); (4) different time-dependent adherence kinetics, depending on both the bacteria and nature of the solid surface; and (5) a propensity for plaque streptococci to bind to uncoated dentin.
TI  - Penicillin tolerance among oral streptococci.
AB  - Penicillin tolerance was elicited in 18 of 46 strains of viridans streptococci isolated from the mouths of 19 of 20 healthy subjects and in 31 of 54 consecutive blood-culture isolates of streptococci. Enterococci and Streptococcus sanguis were the organisms most frequently tolerant but the property was also common among isolates of S. mutans, S. mitior and Lancefield Group G streptococci. Pneumococci and S. salivarius were rarely tolerant. When incubated with penicillin at 5 x MIC in batch or continuous cultures, both tolerant and sensitive strains of oral streptococci declined in number less rapidly than S. pyogenes. However, combinations of penicillin and gentamicin killed tolerant and sensitive oral streptococci.
TI  - Identification of viridans streptococci by three commercial systems.
AB  - The API 20S (Analytab Products, Plainview, NY), the GPI card (Vitek Systems, St.  Louis, MO) and the RapSTR system (Innovative Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) were compared with conventional biochemicals for the identification of viridans streptococci. One hundred nine clinical isolates were tested that included the following species: intermedius (38) sanguis II (20), bovis (variant) (14), mitis (14), salivarius (11), sanguis I (6), constellatus (3), mutans (2), and uberis (1). With initial testing, a correct species call was made with 72% of the isolates with the GPI card, 62% with the RapSTR, and 50% with the API 20S. Identifications of viridans streptococci group or those that needed additional biochemicals for species identification occurred with 28% of isolates with the API 20S, 8% with the RapSTR, and 9% with the GPI card. Incorrect identifications occurred with 6% of the isolates tested by the GPI card, 20% with the API 20S, and 30% with the RapSTR. Most discrepancies with the RapSTR were with 66% of the intermedius isolates, whereas most, 55%, of misidentifications with the API 20S were with sanguis II isolates. No identifications were made with 2% and 13% of isolates with the API 20S and GPI, respectively.
TI  - Association of viridans group streptococci from pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis and upper genital tract infection.
AB  - The prevalence and role of viridans group streptococci in the female genital tract have not been well described. In this study of 482 pregnant women, 147 (30%) were culture positive for viridans group streptococci. Of 392 women with predominant Lactobacillus morphotypes by Gram stain (normal), 110 (28%) were colonized with viridans group streptococci, compared with 37 (41%) of 90 women with bacterial vaginosis (BV) (P = 0.02). To determine whether any species were associated with BV, 177 consecutively isolated viridans group streptococci from the vagina were identified to the species level by using the Facklam scheme. The most frequently isolated species from the vagina was Streptococcus intermedius (13%), followed by Streptococcus acidominimus (6%), Streptococcus constellatus (5%), Streptococcus sanguis II (4%), Streptococcus mitis (2%), Streptococcus salivarius (2%), Streptococcus morbillorum (2%), Streptococcus sanguis I (1%), Streptococcus mutans (0.2%), and Streptococcus uberis (0.2%) with an average of 1.2 species per woman. The distribution of the species among women with BV compared with normal women was not significantly different, with the exception of two species which were associated with BV: S. acidominimus (18% versus 3%, P less than 0.001) and S. morbillorum (6% versus 0.7%, P = 0.005). Amniotic fluid and placenta cultures yielded 54 isolates: S. sanguis II (13 isolates), S. acidominimus (9 isolates), S. intermedius (10 isolates), S. constellatus (3 isolates), S. mitis (4 isolates), S. sanguis I (4 isolates), S. morbillorum (5 isolates), S. mutans (2 isolates), S. uberis (1 isolate), mannitol-positive S. intermedius (1 isolate), and 2 isolates which were not classified. The distribution of species isolated from the upper genital tract was not a reflection of the distribution in the lower genital tract. Dextran-producing species of viridans group streptococci may have a greater pathogenic potential in the placenta than the non-dextran-producing species.
TI  - Cross-sectional analysis of serum antibody to oral streptococcal antigens in children.
AB  - Antibodies to S. salivarius, S. sanguis, and S. mutans cells and to glucosyltransferases (GTF) prepared from these micro-organisms were measured in the sera of 133 infants and children by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). IgG antibody activity to each cell type and GTP was present at birth (presumably derived from maternal transfer) and declined significantly thereafter. IgG antibody levels to S. salivarius and S. sanguis were next detected in young children (2 to less than 3 yr group). However, an increase in IgG antibody to S. mutans cells was not seen until children were older (4 to less than 8 yr group), possibly reflecting the later colonization of this organism. In contrast, IgG antibody to GTF of all three streptococcal species remained at low levels throughout the first four years of life. IgG antibody to S. mutans GTF was then the first to appear (4 to less than 8 yr group). Serum IgA antibodies to all GTFs were not detected until after this time. Fifteen sera were used to develop IgG immunoblots with the GTF antigens. Some positive sera (7/12) demonstrated reaction(s) with GTF from each of the three streptococcal species. Individual sera showed IgG antibody bonds to GTF from several serotypes of the mutans streptococci. No immunoblot reaction was observed with GTF and sera (3) from the four-to-seven-year and younger age groups. These results indicate the presence of serum antibody to bacteria and bacterial products associated with plaque formation very early in life and during and after the pre-adolescent years. The potential exists for this serum antibody to modulate bacterial colonization or accumulation in the oral cavity.
TI  - Effect of nutritional constraints on the biosynthesis of the components of the phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system in a fresh isolate of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - A procedure for the purification of enzyme I (EI) and the protein HPr, the general components of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system, from Streptococcus mutans serotype c is presented. The method was also applied successfully to the purification of EI and HPr from Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sobrinus, and Streptococcus sanguis. Using specific antibodies obtained against the proteins purified from S. mutans DR0001, we determined quantitatively by rocket electrophoresis the cellular levels of EI and HPr in a freshly isolated strain of S. mutans grown under various conditions in continuous culture. The activity of a few specific EIIs was also determined by an in vitro phosphorylation test. Results indicated that maximum EII activities for glucose, mannose, and 2-deoxyglucose were obtained under conditions of glucose limitation, at pH 7.0 and low dilution rate (D = 0.057/h). Increasing the amount of glucose or the dilution rate (D = 0.40/h) or decreasing the pH from 7.0 to 5.5 resulted in a 1.4- to 24-fold decrease in these activities. The EII activity for fructose was not influenced by the growth conditions in the same way as the other EIIs. The fructose EII was highest at pH 5.5 and at high dilution rate under conditions of glucose or nitrogen limitation and was always repressed at pH 7.0 and at low dilution rates. The intracellular levels of EI were also dependent on the growth conditions. The highest concentration (0.65 nmol/mg of protein) was observed in cells grown under glucose limitation at pH 7.0 and high dilution rate, and the lowest concentration (0.12 nmol/mg of protein) was found in cells grown under glucose excess at pH 7.0 and high dilution rate. The other general component of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system, the protein HPr, was not influenced significantly by varying growth conditions.
TI  - Degradation of starch and its hydrolytic products by oral bacteria.
AB  - Selected strains of oral bacteria were analyzed for their ability to degrade wheat starch, maltose, maltotriose, and maltoheptaose. S. sanguis IUOM-11M and JC804, S. mutans 6715, S. salivarius IUOM-8, A. viscosus IUOM-62, and A. naeslundii ATCC 12104 degraded all four substrates. S. mutans NCTC 10449 degraded starch, maltose, and maltotriose, while A. viscosus ATCC 15987 degraded starch and maltose, and S. sanguis SS34 degraded only maltose. L. casei IUOM-14 did not degrade any of the substrates. Analysis of starch degradation products from S. sanguis IUOM-11M and A. viscosus IUOM-62 demonstrated oligosaccharides, maltose, and trace amounts of glucose for the former and oligosaccharides, maltotriose, and maltose for the latter. S. sanguis IUOM-11M alpha-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.20) demonstrated a pH optimum of 6.5 and greatly enhanced activity from maltose-cultured cells as compared with cells cultured in glucose or fructose. The presence of fructose in the growth medium prevented this enhancement of activity by maltose. Maltose inhibited sucrose-dependent synthesis of S. sanguis IUOM-11M insoluble polysaccharide and both primer-dependent and primer-independent synthesis of soluble polysaccharide. Maltoheptaose inhibited primer-dependent but not primer-independent soluble polysaccharide synthesis. Several oral bacteria have the ability to hydrolyze starch and to degrade further the products to acidogenic substrates. These products may also inhibit sucrose-dependent synthesis of polysaccharides, which enhances the production of the acidogenic substrate fructose. The results add further support to the growing body of evidence suggesting that caries-promoting properties of starch may be expressed only when starch is present in diets containing sucrose.
TI  - Gallotannins inhibit growth, water-insoluble glucan synthesis, and aggregation of mutans streptococci.
AB  - During screening for anti-plaque agents of plant origin, ethanolic extracts from  Melaphis chinensis (Bell), the Chinese Nutgall, exhibited strong inhibition of glucosyltransferase (GTF), in vitro adherence and glucan-induced agglutination of Streptococcus mutans 3209 and S. sobrinus B13. More than 91% inhibition of water-insoluble glucan synthesis from sucrose by GTF was noted at a concentration as low as 7.8 micrograms/mL. Bactericidal effects on other mutans streptococci, S. salivarius, and Actinomyces viscosus were also evident. Through chemical fractionation and analyses, along with bioassays, the active components were identified as gallotannins.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of topical anesthetic liquids containing lidocaine or benzocaine.
AB  - Six species of microorganisms commonly found within the oral cavity were exposed  for either one minute or two hours to 5% lidocaine liquid topical anesthetic and benzocaine liquid topical anesthetic. Mixtures of microorganisms and anesthetics were diluted and plated onto a brain heart infusion medium. Reduction in cell viability was 73-100% after exposure to the anesthetic agents when compared with the saline/buffer controls. A significant reduction (p < .005) in cell growth by Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, S. mitis, S. salivarius, Actinomyces viscosus, and Candida albicans was associated with a one-minute and two-hour exposure to lidocaine, benzocaine, 5% lidocaine, and the benzocaine vehicle control. Five percent lidocaine reduced growth of the test orgainisms more than benzocaine in one-minute exposures to S. mutans, A. viscosus and S. salivarius and with a two-hour exposure to S. salivarius.Five percent lidocaine was bacteriocidal or fungicidal to all microorganisms for both time periods whereas, benzocaine liquid topical anesthetic was predominately bacteriostatic or fungistatic after one-minute exposures and bacteriocidal or fungicidal after two hours.The results indicated that two dental liquid topical anesthetics containing lidocaine or benzocaine possessed considerable antimicrobial activity to selected oral microorganisms. The exclusive use of a topical liquid anesthetic may be an adequate means to render the oral mucosa aseptic before injection of a local anesthetic.
TI  - Partial characterisation of the inhibitory substances produced by Streptococcus oralis and related species.
AB  - The production of inhibitory substances was sought by deferred antagonism. Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis produced bactericidal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, but no detectable bacteriocin. Actinomycetes and Neisseria pharyngis were particularly susceptible to the lethal action of hydrogen peroxide. Streptococcus milleri produced bactericidal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocin-like substances. S. oralis strains were inhibited by the bacteriocin-like products of strains of Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus salivarius. Inhibition was due neither to complete bacteriophage nor to fermentation end-products. Extracellular polysaccharides formed during growth could not protect sensitive strains from the effect of hydrogen peroxide or bacteriocin-like substances.
TI  - In-vitro adherence of oral streptococci in the presence of sucrose and its relationship to cariogenicity in the rat.
AB  - Streptococcus sanguis I gave a significantly greater percentage coverage (cell-pellicle attachment) of saliva-coated glass in the presence of sucrose than did Strep. sanguis II (p less than 0.025), and both these gave greater percentage coverages than the other species tested, between which no significant differences were noted. There was a large number of significant differences in clump size (cell-cell attachment) between species-pairs. Among the mutans streptococci, there were significant differences in the percentage coverage between Streptococcus rattus/Streptococcus mutans (p less than 0.05) and Strep. rattus/Streptococcus sobrinus (p less than 0.01), and in clump size between all species-pairs with the exception of Streptococcus cricetus or Strep. sobrinus and Strep. mutans. The rank order of species in relation to fissure caries was mutans streptococci greater than Streptococcus salivarius greater than Streptococcus milleri greater than Strep. sanguis greater than Streptococcus faecalis greater than Streptococcus mitis greater than Streptococcus lactis. There was a significant correlation between percentage coverage in vitro and fissure caries in vivo for strains of Strep. sanguis (p less than 0.05) and pooled strains of Strep. mitis and Strep. sanguis (p less than 0.01). On comparing data for adherence in the presence or the absence of sucrose, the sugar had no effect on the percentage coverage of the seven species tested, but significantly increased the clump size of the mutans streptococci (p less than 0.01) and Strep. sanguis (p less than 0.05).
TI  - Bactericidal activity of teicoplanin in an in-vitro two-compartment kinetic model.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was studied in a model system in which antibiotic concentration is continuously varied. A two-compartment open model was used to reproduce, in vitro serum pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in humans during 24 h after iv administration. Staphylococcal and streptococcal strains of various species were tested. Teicoplanin showed rapid killing of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staph. hominis. All strains of Staph. epidermidis were rapidly killed in spite of the high MIC values (4-16 mg/l). The killing effect against Staph. haemolyticus was less rapid and marked than against Staph. epidermidis, with strain to strain variation. A 99.9% kill was achieved for most strains within 22 h, but with other isolates regrowth occurred which was due to the presence of highly resistant cells in the original population. Other staphylococci (Staph. aureus, Staph. saprophyticus) and Streptococcus pyogenes, Str. bovis and Str. salivarius were reduced by 99.9% within 22 h. Bactericidal activity against other streptococci (Str. mutans, Str. agalactiae, Str. faecalis, Str. faecium) was less marked; against Str. sanguis teicoplanin was bacteriostatic.
TI  - The hydrophobicity of 'viridans' streptococci isolated from the human mouth.
AB  - The hydrophobicity of human oral streptococci was measured with the hexadecane assay modified by the incorporation of polyethylene glycol 6000. Large variability in the hydrophobicity between cultures of some strains grown on different occasions was observed whereas other strains were less variable. The variation in hydrophobicity was significantly reduced by growing the cells in continuous culture in a chemostat under glucose-limiting conditions. The Streptococcus mutans strains used all had low hydrophobicity and the mean hydrophobicity of this species was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) than the mean hydrophobicity of Strep. salivarius, Strep. sanguis Type I and Strep. sanguis Type II strains. This finding supports the view that hydrophobicity is a contributing factor in the adhesion of viridans streptococci to oral surfaces.
TI  - [The testing of crude extracts of Streblus asper (Koi) against Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus salivarius].
AB  
TI  - Metabolism of glycosylsucrose by oral microorganisms and its hydrolysis by Streptococcus salivarius fructosyltransferase.
AB  - Resting-cell suspensions of oral microorganisms grown in sucrose were studied for the production of acid from glucosylsucrose and maltosylsucrose. Most oral microorganisms fermented these sugars to only a limited extent. Streptococcus salivarius, however, metabolized glucosylsucrose as well as sucrose. We therefore looked for a specific enzyme in S. salivarius which was capable of hydrolyzing glucosylsucrose. Fructosyltransferase and invertase were purified from S. salivarius 13419, and the substrate specificities and hydrolytic activities of these enzymes were determined. Purified fructosyltransferase catalyzed fructan synthesis from glucosylsucrose or maltosylsucrose, whereas purified invertase barely hydrolyzed these sugars. These results suggest that the high fermentative efficiency of glycosylsucrose by S. salivarius is due to the hydrolysis of these sugars by fructosyltransferase, but not by invertase. The partially purified fructosyltransferases of Actinomyces viscosus NY1 and Streptococcus mutans NCIB 11723 catalyzed fructan synthesis from glucosylsucrose or maltosylsucrose. The fructosyltransferases of these oral microorganisms are also responsible for the hydrolysis of glycosylsucrose.
TI  - Effects of NaF and SnF2 on growth, acid and glucan production of several oral streptococci.
AB  - The effects of low concentrations of these fluorides on Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitior and Streptococcus sanguis were investigated. Without fluoride, mutans streptococci (Strep. mutans and Strep. sobrinus) produced more acid than the other strains; both fluorides reduced acid production in all strains. NaF had little effect on growth; SnF2 decreased growth in all strains, most evidently in the Strep. mutans. In all growth conditions, Strep. sobrinus produced the most alkali-soluble glucan. Both fluorides enhanced alkali-soluble glucan production in mutans streptococci while only SnF2 enhanced this in the other streptococci.
TI  - A simple method for determining extracellular polysaccharide-producing ability of oral streptococci.
AB  - A simple method is described for determining the types of extracellular polysaccharides produced by oral streptococci. The method yields quantitative results in which the amount of polysaccharides produced is normalised with respect to DNA. Results correlate well with previously published data for oral streptococci, except in the case of Streptococcus oralis for which there is no previously published data. All species within the mutans group produced both soluble and insoluble glucan; while soluble fructan was only produced by strains of Streptococcus rattus and Streptococcus mutans. The major extracellular polysaccharide produced by Streptococcus salivarius was soluble fructan, although some strains produced soluble and insoluble glucan. Most Streptococcus sanguis strains produced soluble and insoluble glucan. Soluble fructan was produced by some strains of S. sanguis and S. oralis. The latter also produced soluble and insoluble glucan. No detectable extracellular polysaccharide was elaborated by Streptococcus milleri, Streptococcus faecalis or Streptococcus lactis.
TI  - The effect of smokeless-tobacco extracts on the growth of oral bacteria of the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - Aqueous tobacco extracts were used to supplement a basic salts solution (BSS) and a microbial medium. Thin-layer chromatography revealed sucrose in only one of four extracts. Discs saturated with extracts (0.1-50 mg/ml) failed to inhibit growth of any of the micro-organisms. Supplementation (10 mg/ml) of BSS with the tobaccos lacking sucrose resulted in augmented growth of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus sanguis whereas the sucrose-containing brand augmented only Strep. sanguis growth. Thus extracts of these smokeless tobaccos would serve as a growth substrate for three species of oral streptococci which are frequently associated with human dental caries.
TI  - A simplified diagnostic system for cultural detection and enumeration of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - A simple dip-slide test (Cariescreen SM) based on MSB selective agar was devised  for detection and quantitation of Streptococcus mutans in oral samples. For this test, a bacitracin tablet is dissolved in a vial containing buffered saline diluent. Paraffin-stimulated saliva is collected in this diluent vial. A dip slide which incorporates a modified MSB agar (minus bacitracin) is immersed briefly in the diluted saliva. After addition of a CO2-generating tablet, the screw-cap dip slide is closed tightly in the vial and incubated for two days at 37 degrees C and one day at room temperature. S. mutans populations in saliva are estimated by comparison with a colony density chart. Growth of reference strains of S. mutans was equivalent on Cariescreen SM dip slides and on MSB agar plates. Reference strains of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis, and Streptococcus milleri did not grow on Cariescreen SM dip slides. Aliquots of saliva from 50 schoolchildren and 51 adults were tested by the dip-slide method and by conventional plating methods in MSB agar. Very good correlation (0.93) between the two methods was obtained. This simplified S. mutans detection system is suitable for use by clinical personnel in dental clinics or other non-laboratory settings for identification of subjects potentially at risk for caries.
TI  - [Bacteriological investigation of the cariogenic effects of sugar alcohols and sucrose].
AB  - Considerable evidence indicates that the disaccharide, sucrose is probably the major dietary factor in dental caries formation and much subsequent research has gone into the search for another sweetener to replace sucrose. Currently, there is much interest in the development of new sweeteners and the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols. The present study aimed to examine the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols (xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol) and sucrose on growth pattern and acid production of S. mutans, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. faecalis, S. viridans, L. casei and L. acidophilus in vitro by using Photo Electrical Colorimeter and pH meter. In conclusion the results in this study showed that out of sugar alcohols, xylitol is the only compound which, depending on its concentration, significantly did not affect the growth and acid production of all tested micro organisms.
TI  - The early bacterial colonization of acrylic palates in man.
AB  - Adhesive tape applied to the fitting surface was used to study the early colonization of acrylic palates in six subjects. Streptococci were major constituents of the plaque accumulated on the tape over the first 3 days. Bacterial colonization of the tape discs was selective in that dextran-producing streptococci constituted a greater proportion of the total streptococcal count after 15 min compared with that of the initial sample and saliva, while the converse was true for Streptococcus salivarius. Scanning electron microscopy showed that denture plaque development started in grooves and depressions on the surface of the tape, and became more extensive with time. Comparison of the colonization of tape and acrylic discs in one individual demonstrated that the tape was a suitable model for in vivo colonization of dentures or orthodontic appliances.
TI  - An improved medium for isolation of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - A medium based upon tryptone, yeast extract, cystine (TYC) agar and incorporating bacitracin and sucrose has been evaluated for selective isolation of Streptococcus mutans. The effect of varying the concentrations of sucrose and bacitracin on the recovery of two standard strains was investigated. Growth of S. mutans NCTC 10449 was significantly inhibited by increasing concentrations of sucrose but was not affected by bacitracin; the reverse was seen with S. sobrinus strain 6715. The best compromise between recovery of the streptococci and growth of other organisms was obtained with a final sucrose concentration of 20% and bacitracin 0.2 units/ml. In comparison with three other selective media, this medium gave the highest recovery rate of standard strains, indicating that it is superior to mitis-salivarius bacitracin (MSB) agar for the recovery of S. mutans from saliva.
TI  - In vitro studies of growth and competition between S. salivarius TOVE-R and mutans streptococci.
AB  - Streptococcus salivarius TOVE-R has previously been reported as a successful competitor with Streptococcus mutans 10449S and Streptococcus sobrinus 6715-13 WT on the teeth of rats. We studied, in vitro, some possible bases for this competition, including hydrogen peroxide or catalase production, bacteriocin or enocin production, and growth rates. Growth rates were measured spectrophotometrically in both complex and defined media. We studied conditions of aerobic and anaerobic incubation; glucose and sucrose medium supplementation at three concentrations each; various initial pH's; singly- or doubly-inoculated cultures; and half-strength, normal, or double-strength broth used both fresh and as culture filtrates. TOVE-R grew as well as did mutans streptococci at acid pH, decidedly better at alkaline pH, and nearly twice as fast near neutral pH. The average doubling time for TOVE-R was about 0.5 hr, while that for the mutans streptococci was about 1.0 hr. When TOVE-R was grown together with a mutans streptococcus, the growth rate observed for the doubly-inoculated culture was equal to or less than that of TOVE-R alone, never greater. The presence and proportions of both organisms in mixed cultures were confirmed by plate counts, direct specific immunofluorescence, and Nomarski interference microscopy. There was no evidence, by any of the methods employed, to indicate the production of an inhibitory substance against mutans streptococci by TOVE-R, or vice versa. Also, there was no evidence that the faster growth rate of TOVE-R could be attributed to nutrient limitation of the mutans streptococci.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Coagglutination reactions between Candida albicans and oral bacteria.
AB  - An agglutination assay for detecting intermicrobial adherence between the cells of Candida albicans and various oral bacteria is described. Strains of Streptococcus sanguis, S. salivarius, S. mutans, S. mitis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces viscosus all coagglutinated with C. albicans. No interaction could be demonstrated between the cells of Bacteroides melaninogenicus and those of C. albicans. Preliminary investigations of these interactions suggest that binding of F. nucleatum and A. viscosus to C. albicans is mediated by bacterial proteins, possibly lectins. Other mechanisms must account for the binding of oral streptococci to C. albicans. The possible implications of these findings in relation to oral mucosal colonisation and oral candidal clearance are discussed.
TI  - Acid tolerance, proton permeabilities, and membrane ATPases of oral streptococci.
AB  - Differences in acid tolerance among representative oral streptococci were found to be related more closely to the dynamic permeabilities of the bacteria to protons than to differences in the sensitivities of cell membranes to gross damage caused by environmental acidification. For Streptococcus mutans GS-5, Streptococcus sanguis NCTC 10904, and Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419, gross membrane damage, indicated by the release of magnesium from whole cells, occurred at pH values below about 4 and was rapid and extensive at pH values of about 3 or less. A more aciduric, lactic acid bacterium, Lactobacillus casei ATCC 4646, was more resistant to environmental acidification, and gross membrane damage was evident only at pH values below 3. Assessments of the movements of protons into S. mutans cells after an acid pulse at various pH values indicated that permeability to protons was minimal at a pH value of about 5, at which the average half time for pH equilibration across the cell membrane was about 12 min. The corresponding values for the less aciduric organism S. sanguis were pH 7 and 8.2 min, and the values for the intermediate organism S. salivarius were pH 6 and 6.6 min. The ATPase inhibitor dicyclohexylcarbodiimide acted to increase markedly the permeability of each organism to protons, and this action indicated that permeability involved not only the passive inflow of protons but also active outflow through the proton-translocating membrane ATPase. Membranes were isolated from each of the bacteria, and pH profiles for ATPase activities indicated pH optima of about 7.5, 7.0, 6.0, and 5.0 for S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. mutans, and L. casei, respectively. Thus, the pH profiles for the enzymes reflected the acid tolerances of the bacteria and the permeabilities of whole cells to protons.
TI  - High-performance liquid chromatographic analysis of bacterial fatty acid composition for chemotaxonomic characterization of oral streptococci.
AB  - A high-performance liquid chromatographic method was developed to analyze the fatty acid composition of bacterial lipids. After saponification of lipids extracted from bacteria, the liberated fatty acids were labeled with a fluorescence reagent, 4-bromomethyl-7-acetoxycoumarin, followed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic separation and fluorescence detection. All bacterial fatty acids were simultaneously separated within 30 min and sensitively determined. This method was applied to the chemotaxonomic characterization of oral streptococci. The fatty acid composition of phospholipids and total lipids distinguished Streptococcus mutans from any other species examined and showed that Streptococcus sanguis had a close taxonomic relationship with Streptococcus salivarius.
TI  - The intra-oral effect on enamel demineralization of extracellular matrix material synthesized from sucrose by Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The role of extracellular matrix material (EMM) synthesized from sucrose (S) by Streptococcus mutans IB-1600 in altering the demineralizing potential of artificial plaque was evaluated with an intraoral enamel demineralization test (IEDT). The artificial plaque samples were prepared from cells cultivated in Todd-Hewitt broth (THB) supplemented with various S concentrations and by mixing THB-grown cells with increasing proportions of EMM (heat-killed THB + 2% S-cultivated cells). The samples were also evaluated for cell density (DNA content) and acidogenicity in vitro (pH-stat), as well as for in situ pH changes during a 45-minute intra-oral test following a 10% glucose rinse. An increase in the proportion of EMM relative to cell density was associated with an increase in enamel demineralization. This trend reversed when the ratio of cells to EMM was less than 1:19. Experiments involving strains of S. mitis, S. sanguis, and S. salivarius suggested a similar effect of EMM. The intra-oral pH data suggest that the presence of EMM may enhance demineralization by altering diffusion properties of plaque.
TI  - Comparative recovery of Streptococcus mutans on five isolation media, including a new simple selective medium.
AB  - For the isolation of Streptococcus mutans, several selective media have been developed, of which Mitis-Salivarius Sucrose Bacitracin agar (MSB) is the most widely used (Gold et al., 1973). Recently, the Trypticase Yeast-Extract Cystine agar medium (TYC, de Stoppelaar et al., 1967) was modified into a selective medium for S. mutans, called Trypticase Yeast-Extract Cystine Sucrose Bacitracin (TYCSB, van Palenstein Helderman et al., 1983). The aim of this study was to compare the recovery of S. mutans from clinical samples on Mitis-Salivarius agar (MS), MSB, TYC, and TYCSB. Further, a new simple selective medium for S. mutans was introduced. This medium, called TSY20B, was supposed to have the same qualities as TYCSB, but its preparation is less laborious. One hundred eighty-five plaque and saliva samples from 37 subjects were plated on MS, MSB, TYC, and TYCSB, and 285 samples from 23 subjects were plated on TYCSB and TSY20B. All plates were incubated at 37 degrees C in a 91% N2, 5% CO2, 4% H2 atmosphere for five days. The S. mutans counts on TYC and TYCSB were significantly higher than on MS or MSB by almost a factor of 10. Seventy-seven percent of the samples gave higher S. mutans counts on TYCSB than on MSB. Especially, samples with high S. mutans d/g numbers gave lower S. mutans counts on MSB. These data clearly indicate that MSB agar is inhibitory for S. mutans and should not be used. An additional advantage of TYCSB over MSB agar is the possibility of distinguishing S. mutans serotypes d/g from other serotypes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Isolation and mode of action of a cell-free bacteriocin (mutacin) from serotype g Streptococcus mutans MT3791.
AB  - A bacteriocin, mutacin MT3791, was isolated from the culture supernatant of a dialysate medium of Tryptose phosphate broth cultures of Streptococcus mutans MT3791 (serotype g), a clinical isolate from a carious lesion of a Japanese child. The mutacin was found to inhibit the growth of most indicator strains of S. mutans and S. salivarius by the drop assay method. The mutacin was purified 1,450 fold from culture supernatant of S. mutans MT3791 by 60% saturated ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by ultracentrifugation at 300,000 X g for 18 h. Gel filtration studies using Sepharose 4B indicated that the mutacin was highly aggregated, but could be dissociated by addition of 1% (final concentration) Tween 80 or 6M urea. The mutacin was heat stable, but the activity was destroyed after autoclaving at 120 degrees C for 60 min. It was susceptible to the enzymatic action of papain and pronase, but not trypsin, lipase or nucleases. The mutacin was adsorbed to whole cells of most strains of S. mutans. Mutacin MT3791 was bactericidal for an indicator strain, S. mutans MT703R (serotype e). The mutacin inhibited the incorporation of isotope-labelled precursors of protein, DNA, and RNA. Furthermore, mutacin MT3791 selectively and markedly suppressed the growth of S. mutans present in the dental plaque obtained from active carious lesions in the teeth of children. Possible role of mutacin in vivo was discussed with special reference to oral microbial ecology.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of scrB, the structural gene for the Streptococcus mutans phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sucrose phosphotransferase system sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase.
AB  - A DNA fragment encoding the sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase component of the Streptococcus mutans phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sucrose phosphotransferase system has been recovered from a plasmid-based genomic library of strain GS5. The locus, designated scrB, was found to reside within a 2.9-kilobase-pair restriction fragment present on the chimeric molecule pVA1343 (7.3 kilobase pairs). Minicell analysis of pVA1343-directed translation products revealed that the scrB product synthesized in Escherichia coli V1343 was a single peptide of Mr 57,000. This polypeptide was reactive with antiserum prepared against S. mutans intracellular invertase, which has been previously shown to have an Mr of 43,000 to 48,000. The basis of this difference in Mr was not established but may represent a posttranslational proteolytic event which occurred in S. mutans but not in recombinant V1343. Sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase purified to homogeneity from V1343 exhibited Michaelis constants of 180 mM for sucrose and 0.08 mM for sucrose-6-phosphate. Deletion analysis of pVA1343 facilitated the assignment of a coding region for the hydrolase within the insert, as well as an orientation for the transcription of scrB. scrB-defective strains of S. mutans constructed by additive integration of an insertionally inactivated scrB locus exhibited the sucrose sensitivity characteristic of this mutant class. Similar loci were detected by DNA-DNA hybridization in additional strains of S. mutans and two strains of Streptococcus cricetus, but not in single strain representatives of S. rattus, S. sobrinus, S. sanguis I and II, S. salivarius, or S. mitis.
TI  - Streptococci and activities of sucrases and alpha-amylases in supragingival dental plaque and saliva in three caries activity groups.
AB  - Thirty-eight young adults participated in the study. They were divided in a caries-inactive group, a low caries activity group and a moderate to high caries activity group. Total cultivable bacteria, Streptococcus salivarius, and S. mutans in plaque and saliva were quantitated on TSA, MS, and MSB plates, respectively. Sucrase activity was determined by measuring reducing sugars in plaque and saliva after incubation with sucrose. alpha-Amylase activity was determined by Pharmacia Phadebas Amylase test. The data were analyzed with the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. The only significant difference was observed for plaque alpha-amylase activity between the caries-inactive group and the moderate-high caries activity group (P less than 0.05). The lack of differences concerning the other variables is discussed mainly on the basis of the multifactorial character of dental caries and the possible insufficiency of the applied methods.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a 60-kilodalton salivary glycoprotein with agglutinating activity against strains of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - A bacterial agglutinin specific for strains of Streptococcus mutans was isolated  from human saliva. Physiochemical analyses showed the agglutinin to be a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 60,000. The agglutinin aggregated four of the eight strains of Streptococcus mutans tested but did not aggregate the strains of Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus mitis tested. Chemical modification of carbohydrate moieties of the agglutinin with sodium metaperiodate had no effect on aggregation, whereas modification of the polypeptide portion with trypsin abolished aggregating activity. A set of five murine hybridoma antibodies was employed to further analyze the agglutinin. Two carbohydrate-specific antibodies, directed against D-mannose and N-acetylgalactosamine moieties, respectively, failed to block agglutinin- or whole saliva-mediated aggregation of S. mutans cells. In contrast, two antibodies directed against pronase-sensitive antigenic sites blocked both agglutinin- and saliva-mediated aggregation of S. mutans cells. Western blot analysis with the agglutinin-specific hybridoma antibodies demonstrated the agglutinin in whole saliva and in artificial tooth pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite beads incubated with saliva. These results suggest that a 60-kilodalton glycoprotein of human saliva is a bacterial agglutinin with specificity for certain strains of S. mutans. They further suggest that aggregation is mediated by polypeptide rather than carbohydrate determinants of the glycoprotein.
TI  - Comparative adhesion of seven species of streptococci isolated from the blood of  patients with sub-acute bacterial endocarditis to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro.
AB  - The adhesion to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro of 21 strains of streptococci isolated from the blood of patients with sub-acute bacterial endocarditis (SABE) was measured. The species, in order of greatest adhesion, were Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus milleri, Streptococcus sanguis, dextran-positive Streptococcus mitior, dextran-negative Streptococcus mitior and Streptococcus salivarius. Individual strains within species, however, cannot be assumed to be representative of their species and may exhibit unusually high or low adhesion. Adhesion depended upon both bacterial concentration and period of contact. There was no simple relationship between ability to adhere and liability to cause endocarditis. Formation of dextran did not increase adhesion. The streptococci were more adhesive than strains of Escherichia coli and Neisseria sicca and less adhesive than strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.
TI  - Microbiological and microhardness evaluation of artificial enamel fissures worn intraorally by humans.
AB  - Devices simulating occlusal fissures were constructed from dental enamel and bonded to human maxillary molar teeth for 3 weeks. Facilitation of in vivo caries research in humans is the long-range goal for this model system. In the present investigation, microbial compositions of plaque in the fissural space of the model and natural fissural plaque from teeth bearing the devices were compared. Plaque from models constructed from either bovine or human enamel was also compared. In addition, microhardness of the enamel surfaces was examined before and after oral exposure. Plaque in both bovine and human enamel models differed significantly from natural fissural plaque in several microbial categories. Differences appeared to be related to the increased accessibility of the deep fissural contents of the models. For example, levels of the aciduric Streptococcus mutans and Veillonella species were higher in the models, although levels of a salivary inhabitant, Streptococcus salivarius, were lower. Plaque in bovine and human enamel models was similar, and both models showed significant decreases in enamel microhardness after oral exposure for 3 weeks. The model system should be useful in caries research in that carieslike activity was simulated within a relatively short period of time, and the fissural space became colonized by high levels of cariogenic bacteria.
TI  - Effect of monoclonal antibodies against lipoteichoic acid from the oral bacterium Streptococcus mutans on its adhesion and plaque-accumulation in vitro.
AB  - Five monoclonal antibodies directed against Streptococcus mutans strain JBP lipoteichoic acid (LTA) were characterized. They were all similarly reactive with the immunizing LTA-containing extract, with intact Strep. mutans JBP cells and with LTA purified from Lactobacillus casei. Immobilized anti-LTA antibodies removes LTA from LTA-containing extracts. The binding of antibodies to LTA was inhibited by the aqueous extract but not by the organic extract of de-acylated LTA, indicating reactivity with the polyglycerol-phosphate portion of the molecule. Antibodies were reactive with all serotypes of Strep. mutans, as well as with strains of Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis and L. casei, but not with LTA-negative species Streptococcus mitis or Actinomyces viscosus. Anti-LTA antibodies at doses of 0.3 or 3.0 micrograms/ml, had no effect on the adherence of Strep. mutans JBP to experimental salivary pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite, but enhanced adherence 150-300 per cent at 30 micrograms/ml. There was no effect of anti-LTA antibodies in a chemostat model which measured sucrose-dependent plaque accumulation by Strep. mutans. The results argue against a major role for LTA in Strep. mutans adherence or plaque accumulation in vitro.
TI  - Phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase transport system of Streptococcus mutans: purification of HPr and enzyme I and determination of their intracellular concentrations by rocket immunoelectrophoresis.
AB  - Enzyme I and HPr, the general proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase system, play a pivotal role in the control of sugar utilization in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. To determine whether growth conditions could modify the rate of biosynthesis of these proteins in Streptococcus mutans, we first purified to homogeneity enzyme I and HPr from S. mutans ATCC 27352. Using specific antibodies obtained against these proteins, we determined by rocket electrophoresis the intracellular levels of enzyme I and HPr in cells of S. mutans 27352 grown under various batch culture conditions and in a number of glucose-grown cells of other strains of S. mutans. HPr was purified by the procedure reported by Gauthier et al. (L. Gauthier, D. Mayrand, and C. Vadeboncoeur, J. Bacteriol. 160:755-763, 1984) and displayed a single band with a molecular weight of 6,650 when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea gel electrophoresis. Enzyme I was purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, affinity chromatography on an anti-Streptococcus salivarius column, and preparative electrophoresis. The protein migrated as a single band in native and denaturating gel electrophoresis. The subunit molecular weight of enzyme I determined by electrophoresis under denaturating conditions was 68,000. In gel filtration chromatography at 4 degrees C, the enzyme migrated as a 135,000- to 160,000-molecular-weight species, suggesting that enzyme I is a dimer. In double immunodiffusion experiments, antibodies against HPr reacted with several oral streptococci, Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus faecium, and Lactobacillus casei, but not with Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Antibodies against enzyme I of S. mutans 27352 cross-reacted with enzyme I from all the other oral streptococci tested. No cross-reaction was observed with other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The levels of enzyme I and HPr determined by rocket electrophoresis in S. mutans 27352 varied at the most by twofold, depending on the growth conditions. Glucose-grown cells of other S. mutans strains contained levels of enzyme I and HPr which were similar to those found in S. mutans 27352.
TI  - Longitudinal microbiological investigation of a hospitalized population of older  adults with a high root surface caries risk.
AB  - Intact root surfaces of chronically hospitalized subjects were sampled periodically to enumerate bacterial species believed to be associated with root caries. Bacteria were cultivated and enumerated using a series of selective and enriched media. Microbial counts, isolation frequencies, and percent cultivable flora data were analyzed for caries-active and caries-free surfaces and subjects. S. mutans, S. sanguis, A. viscosus, A. naeslundii, total lactobacilli, and Veillonella accounted for a mean of less than 20% of the cultivated flora, with mitis salivarius agar cultivable streptococci averaging less than 5%. The microbial count data were highly variable, precluding the finding of significant differences in caries association for either subjects or sites. Streptococci, especially S. mutans, correlated highly with lactobacilli in the samples.
TI  - Evaluation of the API 20 STREP system for species identification of "viridans" streptococci isolated from bacteremia.
AB  - Species identifications of 71 strains of viridans streptococci isolated from blood and 4 reference strains were made by the API 20 STREP system (API system S. A., Montalieu-Vercien, France) and the conventional method. There are high levels of agreement between results obtained with the both methods for determining acidification from carbohydrate except inulin. The API 20 STREP system correctly identified 74.7% of the viridans streptococci with 9.3% low descrimination, 12% incorrect and 4% unidentified. All strains of S. mitis, S. mutans, S. salivarius and S. anginosus-constellatus were correctly identified. The correct identification rates for S. sanguis I, S. sanguis II and S. MG-intermedius were 88.9%, 68% and 61% respectively. The difference of inulin reaction and the taxonomy discrepancy may be the cause of different identification. The study indicates that the API 20 STREP system has a good potentiality for species identification of viridans streptococci at present time, however, further refinement in needed.
TI  - Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus detection in the assessment of dental root surface caries risk.
AB  - Forty-five subjects contributing 150 root surfaces with gingival recession were sampled seven times over a 32-month period. We calculated isolation frequencies of lactobacilli on selective Rogosa SL agar and S. mutans in a sensitive enrichment broth and on mitis salivarius agar. Both S. mutans and lactobacilli were isolated more frequently from surfaces which became carious than from those remaining caries-free. Isolation frequencies were also higher for caries-free surfaces in caries-active subjects than for caries-free surfaces in caries-inactive subjects. The presence or absence of S. mutans and lactobacilli in samples taken at baseline could discriminate between subjects who were to be root-caries-active and those who were to remain root-caries-inactive during the subsequent observation period. Moreover, if both bacteria were detected or only S. mutans was detected on a root surface at its entry into the study, that surface had a greater risk for developing a root lesion. However, the tests could not predict which root surfaces within the mouths of caries-active subjects were to become carious. Analysis of the data suggests that simple microbiological detection tests may be useful in identifying patients at high risk of root caries.
TI  - The surface free energy of oral streptococci after being coated with saliva and its relation to adhesion in the mouth.
AB  - Contact angle measurements on layers of bacteria were used to determine the bacterial surface free energy (gamma b) of a variety of oral streptococcal strains, both without and after being coated with human whole saliva. At least four isolates of each species, either freshly isolated or laboratory strains, were used. The species Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, and S. salivarius were homogeneous, having high surface free energies, and were not affected by saliva treatment (gamma b = 106 +/- 12 and 107 +/- 10 erg X cm-2 in the absence and presence of saliva coating, respectively; n = 20). S. mitis had a very low surface free energy (46 +/- 15; n = 5), which was significantly increased after salivary adsorption (71 +/- 14 erg X cm-2; p less than 0.002). The species S. milleri contained strains with both high and low gamma b. Calculation of the interfacial free energy of adhesion (delta F adh) for bacteria from a saliva suspension to solid surfaces with various arbitrary surface free energies (gamma s) showed that, theoretically, most strains will encounter thermodynamically favorable conditions for adhesion to surfaces with a gamma s above 62 erg X cm-2. However, S. mitis strains not coated with saliva would only be able to adhere to surfaces with gamma s lower than this value. Saliva-coating reverses the calculated relationship with gamma s for these strains. The results indicate that an enamel surface with a low gamma s value would be thermodynamically unfavorable for adhesion of most oral streptococci.
TI  - Growth inhibition of Streptococcus mutans by cellular extracts of human intestinal lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro growth of Streptococcus mutans was completely inhibited by water-soluble extracts from cells of various intestinal lactic acid bacteria identified as Streptococcus faecium, Streptococcus equinus, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus salivarius. The growth inhibition was dependent on the concentrations of the extracts. In contrast, the extracts did not inhibit the growth of the major indigenous intestinal lactic acid bacteria isolated from humans. These lactic acid bacteria were not acutely toxic in mice.
TI  - Inhibition of ecological emergence of mutans streptococci naturally transmitted between rats and consequent caries inhibition by Streptococcus salivarius TOVE-R infection.
AB  - The ability of Streptococcus salivarius strain TOVE-R to inhibit the ecological emergence of virulent representatives of the most prevalent human mutans streptococci on the teeth of specific pathogen-free Osborne-Mendel rats was studied. Rats which were infected by TOVE-R, or either S. mutans 10449S or S. sobrinus 6715-13WT, or uninfected were transiently co-caged so as to allow natural fecal transfer of organisms due to coprophagy. The infectants were differentially recovered from swabs of the teeth over the time course of the experiments and from sonified teeth at termination. Data were expressed on both relative (percentage) and absolute (CFU) bases. Initial oral colonization of rats by TOVE-R inhibited the ecological emergence of fecally transmitted S. mutans 10449S and S. sobrinus 6715-13WT. There was a generally inverse relationship between the percentages and absolute numbers of TOVE-R and the mutans streptococci on the teeth, which strongly suggested their competition for tooth sites. Absolute numbers of total recoverable flora from the teeth upon sonification were correlated with caries scores, thus suggesting that total recoverable flora counts substantially reflect cavitation status. TOVE-R itself induced no apparent caries activity and its transmission to rats already infected by 10449S or its colonization of rats before 10449S infection inhibition caries induction by this S. mutans strain; similar anticaries effects were not statistically significant for TOVE-R against 6715-13WT in these experiments. These data on the inhibition of the ecological emergence of the mutans streptococci supplement the already reported ability of TOVE-R to preempt initial colonization of teeth and partially displace the colonization of teeth by the mutans streptococci.
TI  - Cross-reactions between alpha-streptococci and Omniserum, a polyvalent pneumococcal serum, demonstrated by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination.
AB  - In recent years several groups have used serological methods to demonstrate pneumococcal capsular antigens in sputum. In the present study 123 strains of alpha-hemolytic streptococci (including 97 strains from sputum or pharyngeal specimens) were tested for cross-reactions with a polyvalent antipneumococcal serum (Omniserum). Representatives of the following species were included: Streptococcus bovis, S. equinus, S. intermedius, S. lactis, S. milleri, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. suis, and Aerococcus viridans. Serological reactions were detected by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination. Fifteen (12%) of the strains gave positive reactions by all three methods. Positive reactions were also observed with another 32 strains (26%) with two of the methods, whereas 37 strains (30%) gave positive reactions by just one technique. Altogether 84 (68%) strains gave positive reactions with one or more of the methods. Latex agglutination gave positive reactions with 26 (21%) strains compared with 57 (46%) in immunofluorescence and 63 (51%) in immunoelectroosmophoresis. Absorption of the antiserum with one alpha-hemolytic strain reduced but did not entirely eliminate the cross-reactions with five tested strains. These findings indicate a potential risk of cross-reactions with polyvalent antipneumococcal serum in tests carried out on sputa or other specimens which may be contaminated with alpha-hemolytic streptococci.
TI  - Competitive displacement of mutans streptococci and inhibition of tooth decay by  Streptococcus salivarius TOVE-R.
AB  - The ability of Streptococcus salivarius TOVE-R to displace virulent representatives of the most prevalent human mutans streptococci from the teeth of rats, and thereby to inhibit caries, was studied. Streptococcus mutans 10449S- or Streptococcus sobrinus 6715-13WT-infected specific-pathogen-free rats consuming a high-sucrose diet were inoculated by TOVE-R. The infectants were differentially recovered from swabs of the teeth over the time course of infection and from sonically treated material of extracted teeth and excised tongues. Despite initial colonization of the teeth by the mutans streptococci, TOVE-R colonized the teeth, unlike other essentially nonvirulent plaque formers already described. It did not colonize the tongues of the rats. TOVE-R emerged and persisted as a prominent member of the plaque ecology. There was an associated decline in the mutans streptococci on the teeth, and this decline was associated with significant inhibition of the caries component attributable to 10449S infection (56%) and to 6715-13WT infection (52%). TOVE-R did not reliably inhibit the component of fissure caries attributable to the nonmutans indigenous flora of the rats. TOVE-R itself induced no detectable decay. The data suggest the potential therapeutic utility of TOVE-R to inhibit caries by displacement of mutans streptococci from the teeth. These results supplement the already reported ability of TOVE-R to preempt initial colonization of teeth by the mutans streptococci.
TI  - Dissipation of the proton motive force in oral streptococci by fluoride.
AB  - Strains of oral streptococci maintain an intracellular pH (pHi) that is more alkaline than the external pH (pHo). The delta pH (pHi-pHo) was about 0.6 in neutral media and about 0.9 in media of pH 5.5. Addition of 10 micrograms of F- per ml at pH 7.0 reduced the delta pH in Streptococcus salivarius to 0.17. The reduction of delta pH in S. sanguis H7PR3 was less pronounced, whereas the delta pH in S. mutans IB 1600 was unaffected. The F- -resistant mutant of S. salivarius, strain Flr103, maintained a delta pH of 0.51 with 100 micrograms of F- per ml. Addition of F- to cells in media below pH 6.0 led to a reduction of delta pH in all strains. The anion had no effect on the transmembrane electrical gradient of either mutant or parental cells of S. salivarius at pH 7.0. The principal effect of F- addition at neutral pH, therefore, was on the delta pH component of the proton motive force. At pH 5.5, 100 micrograms of F- per ml reduced the transmembrane electrical gradient from 71 to 40 mV in the parent and from 80 to 42 mV in the mutant. We propose that the greater sensitivity of cells to F- at lower medium pH stems from the rapid dissipation of delta pH by the anion. Thus, pH equilibration in media of low pH would lead to a greater reduction of metabolic activity than when it occurs in media at neutral pH. The data also suggest that the growth of streptococci, with or without added F-, is limited when the intracellular pH falls below about 5.7.
TI  - pH change in artificial dental plaque formed by glucosyltransferase and some oral bacteria during batch and continuous culture.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans alone or cell-free glucosyltransferase (G-Tase)-together with either Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Actinomyces viscosus, or Lactobacillus casei cells-formed artificial dental plaque that firmly adhered to glass electrodes in a continuous culture system containing sucrose. The pH in these artificial plaque samples decreased more than did that of the surrounding medium. In the absence of GTase, the bacteria other than S. mutans did not form firmly-adhering plaque on glass electrodes. The pH of the plaque formed with GTase alone did not show the pH decrease seen when the plaque contained bacteria, but, because it catalyzed the synthesis of glucan, it is suggested that the glucan acts as a diffusion barrier to retard acid loss from plaque containing acid-producing bacteria.
TI  - The phylogenetic position of Streptococcus and Enterococcus.
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes, S. equinus, S. bovis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. mutans, S. rattus, S. cricetus, S. lactis, S. raffinolactis and Enterococcus faecalis have been characterized by oligonucleotide cataloguing of their 16S ribosomal RNA. All the organisms form a loose but coherent group that is phylogenetically equivalent to those of lactobacilli, bacilli, the Brochothrix and Listeria group, and related taxa that constitute one of several sublines within the 'Clostridium' branch of Gram-positive eubacteria. Within the Steptococcus-Enterococcus group, organisms fall into three moderately related clusters defined by Enterococcus, the lactic acid streptococci and streptococci of the pyogenic and oral groups, respectively.
TI  - Reduction of acidurance of streptococcal growth and glycolysis by fluoride and gramicidin.
AB  - The acidurance of glycolysis by intact cells of Streptococcus mutans GS-5, Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 25925, and Streptococcus sanguis NCTC 10904 was found to be highly dependent on membrane functions affected by gramicidin, which increases the proton permeability of cell membranes. Plots of % glucose utilized during two hours against suspension pH values for cells suspended in 100 mM phosphate buffer plus 1 mM MgCl2 plus 13.9 mM glucose indicated, for 50% glucose utilization, pH values of 5.0 for S. mutans, 5.7 for S. salivarius, and 6.2 for S. sanguis. Gramicidin treatment shifted these values to 6.0, 6.3, and 6.9, respectively. Growth of S. mutans and S. salivarius in complex media proved to be more acid-sensitive than was glycolysis, and in batch cultures, there was a well-defined, post-growth phase of glycolysis. Minimum pH values for growth and for glycolysis in medium with excess glucose were approximately 4.8 and 4.4, respectively, for S. mutans, and 4.9 and 4.3 for S. salivarius. S. sanguis was less aciduric and showed little differential acid sensitivity, with minimum pH values of about 5.2 for both growth and glycolysis. Fluoride acted to eliminate the differences in acidurance of growth and glycolysis for S. mutans or S. salivarius and to render both processes more acid-sensitive. Thus, glycolysis was more fluoride-sensitive than was growth. Growth was found to be acid-limited in media with initial glucose levels greater than 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5% (weight/volume) for S. sanguis, S. mutans, and S. salivarius, respectively, and to be glucose-limited at lower levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The cariogenicity of sucrose, glucose and maize starch in gnotobiotic rats mono-infected with strains of the bacteria Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus milleri.
AB  - Twenty-one-day-old weanling gnotobiotic WAG/RIJ rats were mono-infected with Streptococcus mutans NCTC 10832, Streptococcus salivarius JMB or Streptococcus milleri NCTC 11169, and maintained on a high carbohydrate diet containing sucrose, glucose or maize starch for 21-days. Fissure caries developed with all combinations of streptococcal strain and carbohydrate except maize starch/Streptococcus salivarius JMB. Caries incidence was highest with Streptococcus mutans NCTC 10832. For all species, the ranking of carbohydrates by cariogenic potential was sucrose greater than glucose greater than maize starch.
TI  - The association between dietary sucrose consumption and microbial population shifts at six oral sites in man.
AB  - Sucrose-related microbial population shifts were evaluated at 6 oral sites in 22  volunteers, who consumed high-sucrose diets for 21 days followed by low-sucrose diets for 21 days. Culturing was performed at 0, 12, 21, 33 and 42 days of the 6-week experiment. Over 50,000 microbial isolates were characterized and analysed. Analysis of initial cultures showed the following site-specific microbial characteristics of the 6 sites evaluated: (1) molar fissures harboured higher levels of Neisseria species and showed the highest facultative-to-anaerobic ratio; (2) molar fissures and cervical buccal sites showed high Streptococcus sanguis levels and total Gram-positive cocci and fewer Gram-negative bacilli; (3) the tongue and saliva gave high concentrations of Streptococcus salivarius and Veillonella sp. Sucrose intake was positively related to concentrations of yeasts and Streptococcus mutans in the molar fissures; Actinomyces viscosus in the mandibular approximal site; Strep. mutans, Veillonella sp. and Lactobacillus sp. in the maxillary approximal site and Strep. salivarius on the tongue and in saliva. Sucrose intake was negatively related to concentrations of Neisseria sp. on the tongue and total Gram-positive bacilli in saliva. A definite ecological effect of sucrose on the oral microflora was confirmed. The high inter-subject and site variations of target bacteria and the generally low magnitude of shifts, however, discourage implementation of microbiological criteria in dietary assessments.
TI  - Inhibition of [3H]-thymidine uptake in human gingival fibroblasts by extracts from human dental plaque, oral bacteria of the Streptococcus and Actinomyces species.
AB  - Extracts from human dental plaque, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces israelli and Actinomyces odontolyticus inhibited [3H]-thymidine uptake by primary human gingival fibroblast cell lines as previous work has shown in respect of HeLa cells. The results show that a variety of oral bacteria, not usually considered to be periodontal pathogens, elaborate factors that adversely affect fibroblasts.
TI  - Isolation of a novel protein involved in the transport of fructose by an inducible phosphoenolpyruvate fructose phosphotransferase system in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Fructose transport in Streptococcus mutans LG-1 is mediated by at least two distinct phosphoenolpyruvate fructose phosphotransferase systems. One system is constitutive and consists of membrane components enzyme II as well as enzyme I and heat-stable protein. The other system is inducible and requires, in addition to enzyme I and heat-stable protein, a soluble substrate-specific protein for catalytic activity. This protein factor, designated IIIfru, was purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, molecular sieving on Sephadex G-75, and preparative electrophoresis. The purified preparation showed only one protein band, with a molecular weight of 12,600, on sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, on gel electrophoresis with the discontinuous buffer Tris-glycine, and after electrofocusing in gel (pI congruent to 3.7). The molecular weight of the native protein determined by gel filtration at 4 degrees C was 51,000. Immunodiffusion experiments performed with immunoglobulins prepared against the purified IIIfru from S. mutans LG-1 suggested that other S. mutans strains possessed a IIIfru. No precipitin bands, however, were detected with extracts from S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. lactis, S. faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus casei, and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Viridans streptococci in infective endocarditis: species distribution and susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  - A method for the speciation of viridans streptococci (non-groupable) is described. The major identification criteria are based on the reactions to a series of biochemical tests, including acid production in lactose, inulin, raffinose, mannitol and sorbitol, hydrolysis of arginine, esculin and Na hippurate, and production of polysaccharides in 5% sucrose media. A total of 450 strains was isolated from blood cultures, 183 of which were from confirmed cases of subacute endocarditis. The latter were identified as follows (%): Streptococcus sanguis I (25.7), S. mitis (19.7), S. sanguis II (19.7), S. mutans (17.5), S. milleri (12), S. morbillorium (3.2) and S. salivarius (2.2). Susceptibility to antibiotics was studied for 129 of these strains: 68% were susceptible to all drugs tested, 20% were resistant only to tetracycline, 4% only to penicillin (MIC = 0.5-4 micrograms ml-1) and 8% were multiply resistant (tetracycline, macrolides and related drugs, chloramphenicol, penicillin, high-level resistance to kanamycin and/or streptomycin [MIC = 1000-80.00 micrograms ml-1].
TI  - Glucose-sucrose-potassium tellurite-bacitracin agar, an alternative to mitis salivarius-bacitracin agar for enumeration of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - An agar medium for selective recovery and enumeration of Streptococcus mutans was developed as an alternative to mitis salivarius-bacitracin (MSB) agar. Combinations of dyes, antibiotics, and tellurite were added to a nonselective medium which, because of its sucrose content, allowed easy recognition of S. mutans colonies. Candle jar incubation for 2 days, by comparison with anaerobic incubation, reduced background flora but did not diminish S. mutans recoveries from clinical samples. Quantitative comparisons were made of the simultaneous recoveries of a number of authentic S. mutans serotype representatives and fresh clinical isolates, using various glucose-sucrose-potassium tellurite-bacitracin (GSTB) formulations and mitis salivarius, MSB, and blood agars. Mitis salivarius counts were not detectably different from blood counts, but counts on MSB were distinctly lower. A formulation of the new medium containing 5% glucose 5% sucrose, 0.001% potassium tellurite, 0.3 U of bacitracin per ml (hence GSTB), and 2% agar gave recoveries nearly equal to those on mitis salivarius agar and much greater than those on MSB. The medium yielded readily recognized S. mutans colonies and facilitated detection of intracellular polysaccharide formers upon flooding with I2 reagent. Freshly isolated serotype c, E, and f colonies could often be distinguished from serotype d and g colonies, a distinction made reliable by testing for intracellular polysaccharide. A study of 300 salivary samples revealed GSTB to give significantly higher recoveries than MSB. About 72% of all samples were substantially underestimated for S. mutans with MSB, and 6.7% of samples were falsely negative for S. mutans with MSB. Recovery of background flora on GSTB was as low or lower than on MSB, and both types of agar could be stored for at least 9 weeks without notable change of selectivity. Thus, GSTB agar appears to be simple and reliable to use and requires no anaerobic incubation. Caution is voiced about interpretation of data previously reported which evaluated S. mutans on MSB agar.
TI  - Cell surface proteins of oral streptococci.
AB  - Whole cells of representative strains of oral streptococci (Streptococcus sanguis, S. mitis, and S. salivarius) were radiolabeled by the lactoperoxidase method of radioiodination. The labeled polypeptides obtained by extraction of whole cells with boiling sodium dodecyl sulfate were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Of the total radioactivity, ca. 70% was released by treating whole cells with trypsin, suggesting that the labeling was confined to proteins located on the cell surface. Most S. sanguis strains studied gave a characteristic banding pattern consisting of a high-molecular-weight (120,000 [120K] to 63K) group of six proteins. Three low-molecular-weight (12K, 16K, and 18K) proteins were also detected in many strains.
TI  - Lactose transport in Streptococcus mutans: isolation and characterization of factor IIIlac, a specific protein component of the phosphoenolpyruvate-lactose phosphotransferase system.
AB  - The transport of lactose in Streptococcus mutans is mediated via an inducible phosphoenolpyruvate-lactose phosphotransferase system. This system requires for catalytic activity a membrane fraction (enzyme II), two general proteins called enzyme I and HPr, and a soluble specific protein termed factor IIIlac. This protein factor was purified from S. mutans ATCC 27352 by chromatographies on DEAE-cellulose, hydroxylapatite, Ultrogel AcA 34, and phosphocellulose. The purified protein migrated as a single band with a molecular weight of 10,000 on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and urea. The molecular weight calculated from the amino acid composition was 10,541. Gel filtration of the native protein gave a molecular weight of 41,500. Its isoelectric point was ca. 4.70. A specific antiserum was prepared against purified factor IIIlac. Immunodiffusion experiments revealed that only cellular extracts from lactose-grown cells contained factor IIIlac. A cross-reaction was observed with all of the S. mutans strains tested as well as with Streptococcus sanguis 10556, Streptococcus lactis 11454, and Staphylococcus aureus 6538. No precipitin band was observed with extracts of Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus casei, and Bacillus subtilis.
TI  - Comparison of two screening tests for Streptococcus mutans and evaluation of their suitability for mass screenings and private practice.
AB  - Two simple microbiological tests for quantitating salivary Streptococcus mutans levels were compared with each other and evaluated for suitability for mass screenings and private practice. Both tests use mitis salivarius medium with bacitracin (MSB) and are selective for S. mutans. One test estimates colonies grown on agar (MSBA) and the other estimates colonies grown in broth that adhere to glass (MSBB). Both are scored from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest). Children (293) in grades 5 and 6 in Tallahassee, Florida (nonfluoridated) were tested for S. mutans levels. Scores of children by both tests were significantly similar (chi 2, regression and Kappa statistical analysis). Correlation coefficients (regression) between scores and DMFS increments of the previous 4 yr were 0.35 (MSBA) and 0.26 (MSBB). Both tests were very good in identifying children with low caries increments, but positive scores did not correlate well with high caries increments. Sampling and interpreting took 2 min (MSBA) and 1 min (MSBB). Cost of MSBA/child was $1.15, and MSBB/child $1.25. These tests are economical and suitable for mass screenings to identify low risk populations who do not require preventive treatment.
TI  - Evaluation of a rapid latex agglutination test for identification of group D streptococci.
AB  - The SeroSTAT latex agglutination test (Scott Laboratories, Inc., Fiskesville, R.I.) for identification of group D streptococci was compared with bile-esculin agar and Lancefield grouping by using 110 clinical isolates of group D streptococci (S. faecalis, 74; S. bovis, 24; S. durans, 3; S. faecium, 9) and 65 viridans streptococci (S. anginosus-constellatus, 2; Streptococcus MG, 15; S. sanguis II, 14; S. mitis, 7; S. mutans, 5; S. salivarius, 8; S. sanguis I, 8; S. acidominimus, 1; S. morbillorum, 2; S. pneumoniae, 3). All strains of group D streptococci were bile-esculin positive. SeroSTAT reactions were falsely positive with 2 strains of S. sanguisII and 1 strain of Streptococcus MG (4.6% of all viridans streptococci tested) and falsely negative with 10 S. bovis, 8 S. faecalis, 1 S. durans, and 6 S. faecium strains (22.7% of all group D streptococci tested). When considered with colonial morphology and hemolytic reaction, SeroSTAT is a rapid (60-s) and useful test for recognition of group D streptococci.
TI  - Disseminated tetracycline resistance in oral streptococci: implication of a conjugative transposon.
AB  - A DNA sequence specifying tetracycline resistance (Tcr) has been previously cloned from a clinical isolate of Streptococcus mutans designated U202 (J. A. Tobian and F. L. Macrina, J. Bacteriol. 152:215-222, 1982). We used this sequence as a molecular probe in studying the dissemination of Tcr among oral streptococcal species isolated from patients treated with tetracycline. Eleven strains (including S. sanguis I, S. sanguis II, S. mitis, and S. salivarius) from seven patients were examined by Southern blot analysis. Seven strains showed strong hybridization to the Tcr probe, two showed weak hybridization, and two did not display detectable hybridization. Based on previous characterization of the cloned sequence, our data suggest the dissemination of the tetM class of resistance determinants among these oral streptococci. One of the clinical S. sanguis I isolates studied was able to transfer its Tcr phenotype to other oral streptococci and to enteric streptococci in the absence of plasmid DNA. This transfer appeared to be conjugation-like on the basis of its insensitivity to DNase and its dependence on intimate cell-to-cell contact. Using the cloned Tcr sequence, we were able to study the progeny of the matings. Our data suggest that this resistance transfer element occupies a chromosomal location in streptococcal cells and that it strongly resembles the conjugative transposon Tn916 in its behavior.
TI  - Reaction of human colostral and early milk antibodies with oral streptococci.
AB  - Colostrum or early breast milk or both from each of 16 healthy women contained agglutinating antibodies for all normal streptococcal inhabitants of the human oral cavity (S. mutans, S. sanguis, S. mitis, and S. salivarius), including those which colonize the neonatal oral cavity in significant numbers. Agglutination correlated with the amount of immunoglobulin A (IgA) binding to bacterial surfaces as measured by mixed reverse passive antiglobulin hemagglutination. Surprisingly, colostral IgA agglutinated our control organism, Brucella abortus. Low levels of colostral or milk IgM and IgG antibodies also reacted with all of the test bacteria. Absorption studies with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that a proportion of antibodies in colostrum and early milk is specific for each of the different oral streptococci. Fractionation on Sepharose 4B indicated that 11S secretory IgA is the predominant form of colostral and milk antibody for all of the test bacteria, including B. abortus. No evidence was found that reactions other than antigen-antibody reactions resulted in binding of colostral immunoglobulins by any of the test bacteria.
TI  - Clinical isolates of Streptococcus mutans serotype c with altered colony morphology due to fructan synthesis.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans MT6801 , MT6861 , and MT6879 , which form large mucoid colonies on mitis salivarius agar, were isolated from a mother and her two daughters. These isolates were identified as serotype c by immunodiffusion with serotype-specific antisera. The large colonies formed on sucrose-containing agar were found to contain water-soluble fructan . The cell-free fructosyltransferase ( FTase ) activity of the strains which formed large colonies was five to eight times higher than that of serotype c S. mutans which produced small, rough colonies typical of this serotype. Furthermore, greater quantities of fructan were synthesized from sucrose by growing cells of MT6801 when compared with MT8148 , a typical serotype c S. mutans. Glucosyltransferase and FTase could be isolated by chromatofocusing from culture supernatants of MT6801 and MT8148 . The FTase activity of both strains was eluted at pH 4.5, and glucosyltransferase was released by elution with an NaCl linear gradient. The eluted FTase activity of MT6801 was significantly higher than that of MT8148 . Strains MT6861 and MT6879 were also found to possess a similar property in terms of FTase activity. These results suggest that formation of large mucoid colonies by these strains is a consequence of high FTase activity.
TI  - Structure and properties of the phosphoenolpyruvate: glucose phosphotransferase system of oral streptococci.
AB  - The presence of three distinct enzymes II that catalysed the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of glucose, fructose, and mannose was established in membranes of glucose-grown cells of Streptococcus salivarius 25975 and various strains of Streptococcus mutans. The enzyme II mannose phosphorylated mainly mannose, glucose, and 2-deoxyglucose, and the enzyme II glucose phosphorylated glucose, alpha-methylglucoside, and 2-deoxyglucose. The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of glucose and alpha-methylglucoside by isolated membrane of wild-type or EII mannose negative mutant cells did not require the presence of any soluble protein other than enzyme I and the phosphocarrier protein HPr. This result suggested that oral streptococci do not possess a soluble factor III glucose. The enzyme II activities varied as a function of the growth sugar but were not coordinately regulated. The variation elicited by specific sugars was not identical for all the strains tested. Nevertheless, in the case of the S. mutans strains, growth at the expense of lactose always caused a significant decrease in the level of enzyme II activities. Finally, experiments conducted with EII mannose negative mutants and also with a pseudorevertant isolated from one of these mutants indicated that the preferential utilization of glucose over lactose by cells growing in mixtures depended on the presence of the EII mannose, but not on glucose-derived metabolites.
TI  - Sucrase and maltase activities in supragingival dental plaque in humans of streptococcal, actinomyces and lactobacilli species.
AB  - 20 reference strains and 72 isolated strains from dental plaque of streptococci,  actinomyces, and lactobacilli species were examined for sucrase and maltase activities. The type of sucrase in the different strains was determined by use of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, acarbose. The enzyme activities were determined as formation of monosaccharide, and quantitated spectrophotometrically. Although variations occurred in enzyme activities between reference and isolated strains, the same general pattern was noticed. Strains of Streptococcus mutans and S. salivarius showed regularly the highest sucrase activities, followed by strains of Actinomyces viscosus and A. naeslundii. Most lactobacilli belonged to the bacteria with low sucrase activity like S. sanguis and S. mitior. In some lactobacilli strains, however, a high sucrase activity was observed. The level of sucrase activity in S. mutans strains was dependent on biotype/serotype, as strains of biotype V/serotype e showed high activities, biotypes I and IV corresponding to serotypes c, f, and d showed intermediate activity, and biotype III/serotype a always showed low activity. In most of the strains the sucrases were composed of enzymes with specificity against both alpha-glucosidic linkage and beta-fructosidic linkage of the sucrose molecule, but in varying ratios. In all species, exept S. sanguis and S. mitior, lower maltase than sucrase activity was observed, but even in the two species mentioned the maltase activities were relatively low. On the basis of observations of selected reference strains in every species examined both sucrases and maltases are to some extent inducible.
TI  - Slide-scoring method for estimation of Streptococcus mutans levels in saliva.
AB  - A method was developed to facilitate the estimation of S. mutans levels in saliva. Paraffin-stimulated saliva was poured on a special slide coated with mitis-salivarius-sucrose agar. Two discs containing bacitracin (5 micrograms) were placed on the inoculated slide and the growth density of S. mutans around the bacitracin discs was scored after incubation in candle jars at 37 degrees C for 48 h. The obtained score values correlated well with the numbers of CFU of S. mutans per 1 ml of saliva estimated by a conventional method using mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. The experimental method was further tested by incubating the slides in an atmosphere created by CO2-generating tables that were placed into the cover tubes of the slides. These score values were similar to those after conventional incubation. The method is suggested for epidemiologic studies and in selecting persons at high risk for caries and in controlling the effectiveness of prophylactic measures of these patients.
TI  - Regulation of glucose metabolism in oral streptococci through independent pathways of glucose 6-phosphate and glucose 1-phosphate formation.
AB  - In vivo rates of glucose uptake and acid production by oral streptococci grown in glucose- or nitrogen-limited continuous culture and batch culture were compared with the glucose phosphorylation activities of harvested, decryptified cells. The strains examined contained significant phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system (PTS) activity, measured by a glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) dehydrogenase-linked assay procedure, but this activity was insufficient to account for the in vivo glucose uptake rates. However, ATP was a superior phosphoryl donor to phosphoenolpyruvate, and unlike the PTS, phosphoryl transfer with ATP was insensitive to bacteriostatic concentrations of chlorhexidine, suggesting glucokinase-mediated G6P formation. Again, G6P formation from the PTS and glucokinase reactions was not commensurate with some of the glucose uptake rates observed, implying that other phosphorylation reactions must be occurring. Two novel reactions involving carbamyl phosphate and acetyl phosphate were identified in some of the strains. No G6P formation was detected with these potential phosphoryl donors, but in the presence of phosphoglucomutase, glucose 1-phosphate (G1P) formation was evident, which was insensitive to chlorhexidine. G1P is a precursor of glycogen, and good correlation was obtained between G1P formation activity and endogenous metabolism of washed cells measured either as a rate of acid production at a constant pH 7 or as a decrease in pH with time in the absence of titrant. A "league table" of abilities to synthesize G1P and produce acid from endogenous metabolism was compiled for oral streptococci grown in batch culture. This indicated that Streptococcus mutans Ingbritt and Streptococcus sanguis Challis were unable to form G1P or produce much acid endogenously, whereas increasing activities were obtained with Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus mitis. In particular, S. mitis had the highest G1P formation activities and was able to decrease the pH to less than 5 in 15 min by endogenous metabolism alone. The data are consistent with the intracellular accumulation of free glucose driven by proton motive force when PTS activities are low and the subsequent phosphorylation to either G6P for metabolism via glycolysis or G1P for glycogen biosynthesis. The accumulation of acetyl phosphate during glucose-limited growth and the availability of arginine for catabolism to carbamyl phosphate provide an explanation as to why some glucose-limited oral streptococci continue to synthesize glycogen under these conditions, which might prevail in plaque.
TI  - Polysaccharide production by cell free transferases in saliva in relation to salivary microflora.
AB  - The supernatant of centrifuged whole saliva was incubated with radiolabeled sucrose to measure polysaccharide production by cell free transferases and to examine whether water-insoluble polysaccharides were produced. Amounts of polysaccharides were considered to reflect the level of cell free transferases in saliva. Plating samples on blood agar, MS and MSB plates gave salivary counts of total CFU, total streptococci, S. salivarius and S. mutans. The capability of the cell free portion of saliva to produce polymers was confirmed and it appeared that the cell free transferases were able to produce water-insoluble polysaccharides. Significant correlations were found between the total and the insoluble polysaccharides from 14C-G'-sucrose and total CFU, total streptococci, S. salivarius and S. mutans, respectively. Heavily S. mutans infected subjects seemed to produce particularly large amounts of water-insoluble polysaccharides from 14C-G'-sucrose. The apparently water-insoluble 14C-F'-polysaccharides correlated significantly to the number of S. salivarius. It was thus concluded that the constitution of the oral microflora and particularly the levels of S. mutans and S. salivarius were of importance for the level of cell free transferase activity.
TI  - Growth and acid tolerance of human dental plaque bacteria.
AB  - Pure cultures of representative strains of cariogenic and non-cariogenic plaque bacteria were assessed for their ability to initiate and maintain growth in broths, adjusted to initial pH levels of 7.0, 5.5 or 5.0, and to produce lactic acid from sucrose or glucose in resting-cell suspensions at pH 6.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0. Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus casei and Streptococcus faecalis showed greater acid tolerance than strains of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis and Actinomyces viscosus. For all species, growth initiation in broth was more acid sensitive than lactic-acid production in resting-cell suspensions. These data confirm and extend previous observations that the species of plaque bacteria most closely associated with the initiation or progression of dental caries are more aciduric than non-cariogenic species.
TI  - The production of dental plaque and caries by the bacterium Streptococcus salivarius in gnotobiotic WAG/RIJ rats.
AB  - The abilities of ten strains of Streptococcus salivarius to colonize rat molars and to induce caries were determined using mono-infected germ-free rats. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the production of micro-colonies and spheroids by Strep. salivarius on exposed surfaces of molar teeth, and abundant dense plaque formation in fissures. Most strains colonized fissures and smooth surfaces as effectively as Streptococcus mutans NCTC 10832, yet produced no buccal or lingual lesions. The four K- strains of Strep. salivarius produced more approximal lesions than the K+ strains but fewer lesions than Strep. mutans. All but one Strep. salivarius strain fell into the high-caries category, together with Strep. mutans. They were all more cariogenic than either Streptococcus milleri NCTC 11169 or Streptococcus faecalis 47.
TI  - Evidence that glucose and sucrose uptake in oral streptococcal bacteria involves  independent phosphotransferase and proton-motive force-mediated mechanisms.
AB  - Sugar transport and glycolysis in Streptococcus sanguis NCTC 7865, Streptococcus  mitis ATCC 903, Streptococcus salivarius NCTC 8606 and several strains of Streptococcus mutans were investigated by following the rate of acid production by washed bacteria at a constant pH of 7.0. The phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system (PTS) was inhibited by low concentrations of chlorhexidine. When this PTS-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine was added to cells washed and re-suspended in KCl, glucose uptake and glycolysis continued at a greatly-reduced rate. Chlorhexidine abolished glucose and sucrose uptake and metabolism in bacteria washed and incubated in saline. The Na+-inhibition was reproduced in KCl-washed bacteria using the cyclic peptide ionophores, valinomycin and gramicidin, to dissipate K+ and H+ gradients across the cell membrane. Glucose metabolism by Strep. mutans B13 was more resistant to chlorhexidine than that of Strep. mutans NCTC 10449 or Strep. sanguis but was more sensitive to the ionophores. Valinomycin had a greater inhibitory effect on strain B13 than the other two. That ion gradients are important in the chlorhexidine-resistant glucose-uptake mechanism was confirmed using the classical uncoupling agents, carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone, 2,4-dinitrophenol and KSCN. Glucose metabolism was inhibited in the presence of both the uncouplers and the PTS-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine and significant inhibition was also observed in the absence of the PTS inhibitor. Lactate or the ATPase inhibitor, dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (DCCD), had similar inhibitory effects on the non-PTS uptake system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Purification of proteins similar to HPr and enzyme I from the oral bacterium Streptococcus salivarius. Biochemical and immunochemical properties.
AB  - The phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) is made of several  proteins. Two of them are designated general proteins because they are required for the transport and phosphorylation of all sugars of the PTS. These two proteins are found in the soluble fraction of cellular extracts and are termed HPr and enzyme I (EI). We reported in this work the purification and the characterization of these two proteins from Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 25975. HPr was purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, molecular sieving on Ultrogel AcA44, and carboxymethylcellulose chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis in the presence of urea revealed a single band with a molecular weight of 6700. The protein contained no tryptophan and had a pI of 4.8. The purification scheme of EI was as follows: DEAE-cellulose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, DEAE-Sephadex A-50 chromatography, preparative electrophoresis, and molecular sieving on Ultrogel AcA34. The five-step purification for EI produced a 199-fold purified preparation with a specific activity of 530 mumol of HPr phosphorylated per minute per milligram of protein at 37 degrees C. The fraction obtained after filtration on Ultrogel AcA34 gave one band (68 000) on sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of the native enzyme determined by gel filtration at 4 degrees C was 135 000, suggesting that it was a dimer. Enzyme I had a pI of 4.2, a pH optimum of 6.7, a Km for HPr of about 27 microM, a Km for phosphoenolpyruvate of 0.48 mM, and kinetics that were consistent with a Ping-Pong mechanism. Evidence had been obtained which indicated that S. salivarius enzyme I was antigenically very similar to enzyme I from various strains of Streptococcus mutans, but not to the enzyme from Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Ultrastructural visualization of the adherence of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus salivarius to hydroxyapatite.
AB  - S. mutans and S. salivarius adherence to saliva-coated and saliva-uncoated hydroxyapatite was studied by transmission and high resolution scanning electron microscopy. No difference was observed between the saliva-coated and saliva-uncoated study series of adherence. The attachment of individual bacteria to apatite crystals was found to be mediated by cell wall projections. These electron-dense structures were characteristically well formed in S. mutans, and even in S. salivarius the projections appeared to link the bacteria to the apatite. The site of attachment in the bacterial cell wall was always at the division area. We suggest that the possible metabolic activity at the cell wall division site, therefore, also works in the adherence process.
TI  - Comparative hydrophobicities of oral bacteria and their adherence to salivary pellicles.
AB  - Oral bacteria were found to differ in their surface hydrophobicities as determined by their ability to adsorb to hexadecane. Strains of Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii, Streptococcus sanguis, S. mitis, and Bacteroides gingivalis proved highly hydrophobic. Strains of B. intermedius, S. salivarius, S. mutans, and B. melaninogenicus were less hydrophobic, whereas strains of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were hydrophilic. An overall correlation was noted between the adsorption of bacteria to hexadecane and their numbers which attached to experimental salivary pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite surfaces. This suggests that hydrophobic bonding plays an important role in this process. Pellicles prepared from saliva which had been extracted with chloroform-methanol to remove lipids adsorbed comparable numbers of S. sanguis and A. viscosus and increased numbers of S. mutans. Analyses of adsorption isotherms indicated that pellicles formed from lipid-depleted saliva contained increased numbers of binding sites for the S. mutans strains studied, and this likely accounts for their enhanced adsorption. Absorption of saliva with 10% octyl or phenyl Sepharose reduced the protein content of saliva by almost half, but the numbers of bacteria which attached to pellicles prepared from such absorbed saliva were similar to or higher than those which attached to control pellicles. These observations suggest that saliva does not contain unique highly hydrophobic salivary macromolecules which serve as essential pellicle receptors for the bacteria studied. The data obtained are consistent with the view that hydrophobic bonding together with interactions between complementary molecules are involved in bacterial attachment to salivary pellicles on teeth.
TI  - Streptococci isolated from the bloodstream and gingival crevice of man.
AB  - One hundred and twenty six strains of streptococci isolated from the bloodstreams of 123 hospital in-patients--55 with endocarditis--and 255 strains isolated from the gingival crevices of 66 volunteers were characterised. Species isolated were Streptococcus mitior, S. sanguis, undifferentiated viridans streptococci, S. salivarius, S. milleri, S. mutans, S. bovis and S. faecalis. There was no significant difference between the distribution of species in blood and in the gingival crevice. S. mitior and S. sanguis were found less frequently in blood than their presence in the gingival crevice would have suggested, whereas S. milleri was found more frequently. This may indicate that S. milleri is more invasive or that it enters the bloodstream from sources other than the gingival crevice.
TI  - Binding of 18F by cell membranes and cell walls of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The binding of 18F to isolated cell membranes and cell walls of Streptococcus mutans GS-5 or other bacteria was assayed. The attachment of 18F to these cell envelopes proceeded slowly and reached equilibrium within 60 min. 18F binding was stimulated by Ca2+ (1 mM). The binding of 18F to cellular components was dependent upon the pH, as well as the amount of 18F and dose of the binder employed. The binding of 18F by cell walls prepared from fluoride-sensitive and fluoride-resistant cells of S. salivarius and S. mutans did not differ significantly. The pretreatment of cell walls or cell membranes for 60 min at 30 degrees C with 1 mg of RNase, DNase, or trypsin per ml did not influence the binding of 18F by the walls and membranes of S. mutans GS-5. However, prior exposure of cell membranes to sodium dodecyl sulfate caused a significant reduction in the number of 18F atoms bound by the membranes. In saturated assay systems, cell membranes of S. mutans GS-5 bound 10(15) to 10(16) atoms of 18F per mg (dry weight), whereas cell walls from S. mutans GS-5, FA-1, and HS-6 or Actinomyces viscosus T14V and T14AV bound 10(12) to 10(13) atoms of 18F per mg (dry weight). 18F in this quantity (10(12) to 10(13) atoms) cannot be detected with the fluoride electrode. The data provide, for the first time, a demonstration of 18F binding by cell membranes and walls of oral flora.
TI  - Interaction of human plasma fibronectin with cariogenic and non-cariogenic oral streptococci.
AB  - The interaction of purified human plasma fibronectin (Fn) with bacteria was studied with a variety of oral streptococci. Each of the strains of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus mitis tested was aggregated by Fn to various degrees, depending on the concentration of Fn added to the test mixtures. Binding assays performed with radiolabeled Fn and various strains of streptococci demonstrated various capabilities to bind Fn, and the amount of Fn bound by each strain was paralleled by its Fn-induced aggregation, with S. mutans 6715 giving the highest values in both assays. Because of the avid binding of Fn by certain strains of potentially cariogenic streptococci, we investigated the possibility that Fn may be present in human saliva and may be adsorbed from saliva onto artificial tooth pellicles. Immunoreactive Fn was detected in paraffin-stimulated whole saliva by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays of saliva adsorbed onto gelatin-coated cuvettes and by immunoelectroblots (Western blots) of salivary components separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gels. Furthermore, immunoreactive Fn was found to be present in artificial tooth pellicles formed by incubating hydroxyapatite beads with whole human saliva. These results demonstrate that certain strains of oral streptococci bind to and are aggregated by Fn. The presence of Fn in artificial tooth pellicles suggests that this macromolecule may play a role in the attachment of potentially cariogenic and other oral streptococci to dental tissues.
TI  - Coaggregation of human oral Cytophaga species and Actinomyces israelii.
AB  - A total of 19 strains of oral Cytophaga sp. obtained from subgingival plaque deposits were tested for their ability to coaggregate with strains of Actinomyces israelii, A. viscosus, A. naeslundii, Streptococcus sanguis, S. mutans, S. salivarius, and S. mitis. Coaggregation was observed only with A. israelii. Based on their coaggregation patterns with eight A. israelii strains, the Cytophaga strains were distributed among three distinct groups: those that coaggregated with A. israelii PK16 but not with A. israelii W1011 (ATCC 29322), those that coaggregated with A. israelii ATCC 29322 but not with A. israelii PK16, and those that coaggregated with none of the eight A. israelii strains. In each of the coaggregations, prior heat treatment (85 degrees C, 30 min) of the Cytophaga cells prevented coaggregation, whereas identical treatment of the A. israelii cells had no effect. The ability of A. israelii PK16 to form adherent plaque on a tooth surface previously coated with Cytophaga plaque was tested with one of the coaggregating Cytophaga strains. White patches of A. israelii plaque were found covering both the amber-colored Cytophaga plaque on the cementum surface as well as the enamel surface to which Cytophaga strains do not adhere. Electron micrographs of thin-sectioned mixed-plaque material revealed both cell types in close proximity. In addition, electron micrographs of negatively stained coaggregated cells showed interbacterial adherence between surface fimbrae on A. israelii and outer membrane blebs on the gram-negative Cytophaga sp. The kinetics of binding of A. israelii to spheroidal hydroxyapatite and to root powder were indicative of a high-affinity binding system with comparatively large numbers of available binding sites on both substrata. These results indicate the highly specific nature of Cytophaga sp.--A. israelii recognition. The contribution of such recognition toward the mechanisms that are responsible for the indigenous nature of these oral bacteria is discussed.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide excretion by oral streptococci and effect of lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide.
AB  - Approved type strains of Streptococcus sanguis, S. mitis, S. mutans, and S. salivarius were grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The rate of hydrogen peroxide excretion, oxygen uptake, and acid production from glucose by washed-cell suspensions of these strains were studied, and the levels of enzymes in cell-free extracts which reduced oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, or hypothiocyanite (OSCN-) in the presence of NADH or NADPH were assayed. The effects of lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide on the rate of acid production and oxygen uptake by intact cells, the activity of glycolytic enzymes in cell-free extracts, and the levels of intracellular glycolytic intermediates were also studied. All strains consumed oxygen in the presence of glucose. S. sanguis, S. mitis, and anaerobically grown S. mutans excreted hydrogen peroxide. There was higher NADH oxidase and NADH peroxidase activity in aerobically grown cells than in anaerobically grown cells. NADPH oxidase activity was low in all species. Acid production, oxygen uptake, and, consequently, hydrogen peroxide excretion were inhibited in all the strains by lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide. S. sanguis and S. mitis had a higher capacity than S. mutans and S. salivarius to recover from this inhibition. Higher activity in the former strains of an NADH-OSCN oxidoreductase, which converted OSCN- into thiocyanate, explained this difference. The change in levels of intracellular glycolytic intermediates after inhibition of glycolysis by OSCN- and the actual activity of glycolytic enzymes in cell-free extracts in the presence of OSCN- indicated that the primary target of OSCN- in the glycolytic pathway was glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.
TI  - Hydrophobicity and adherence of oral streptococci after repeated subculture in vitro.
AB  - Fresh isolates of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus  salivarius from human dental plaque were all highly hydrophobic. After repeated subculture in vitro on blood agar, strains of S. mutans serotype c showed decreased hydrophobicity, whereas serotype d/g strains did not. Parallel to the decreased hydrophobicity in the serotype c strains, an impaired ability to adhere to hydroxyapatite was observed. A similar but less pronounced decrease in hydrophobicity in one S. sanguis strain resulted in a marked decrease in adherence to hydroxyapatite.
TI  - Cysteine toxicity for oral streptococci and effect of branched-chain amino acids.
AB  - Cysteine was bactericidal to strains of Streptococcus mutans and S. salivarius in concentrations that were nontoxic to S. sanguis, S. milleri, or S. mitior when these microorganisms were incubated in a saliva protein-based synthetic medium. Cysteine toxicity for S. mutans also occurred after incubation in synthetic base medium supplemented with amino acids as the nitrogen source for growth. The bactericidal effect of cysteine for S. mutans or S. salivarius in the saliva protein medium was influenced by the cysteine oxidative activity associated with the saliva protein fraction. Valine alone or in combination with leucine or isoleucine was effective in overcoming cysteine toxicity for susceptible strains of S. mutans or S. salivarius. Cysteine toxicity for these oral streptococci may be due to cysteine inhibition of an enzymatic step in the valine-leucine biosynthetic pathway.
TI  - Purification and properties of pyruvate kinase from Streptococcus sanguis and activator specificity of pyruvate kinase from oral streptococci.
AB  - It was found that pyruvate kinases with two different regulatory characteristics  were distributed among oral streptococci. The pyruvate kinases of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, and Streptococcus bovis were activated by glucose 6-phosphate, whereas the enzymes of both Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mitis were activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. Pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) from S. sanguis NCTC 10904 was purified, giving a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme had a molecular weight of 250,000 to 260,000 and consisted of four identical subunits. Whereas the pyruvate kinase from S. mutans was completely dependent on glucose 6-phosphate (K. Abbe and T. Yamada, J. Bacteriol. 149:299-305, 1982), the enzyme from S. sanguis was activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. In the presence of 0.5 mM fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, the saturation curves for the substrates, phosphoenolpyruvate and ADP, were hyperbolic, and the Km values were 0.13 and 0.30 mM, respectively. Without fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, however, saturation curves for both substrates were sigmoidal. GDP, IDP, and UDP could replace ADP. Like the enzyme from S. mutans, the enzyme from S. sanguis required a divalent cation, Mg2+ or Mn2+, and a monovalent cation, K+ or NH4+, for activity, and it was strongly inhibited by Pi. When the concentration of Pi was increased, the half-saturating concentration and Hill coefficient for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate increased. The remarkable fluctuation of intracellular levels of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate observed in the cells growing under glucose limitation and nitrogen limitation implies that the intracellular concentration of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, in cooperation with that of Pi, may regulate pyruvate kinase activity in S. sanguis in vivo.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Streptococcus.
AB  - A numerical taxonomic study of strains of Streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. The major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (S. faecalis, S. faecium, 'S. avium' and a proposed new species 'S. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (S. bovis, S. equinus, S. salivarius, 'S. casseliflavus', S. mutans, S. raffinolactis and an unidentified Oral Group I); (c) lactic species group (S. lactis including S. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (S. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (S. mitis, S. sanguis, a proposed new species 'S. oralis' and 'S. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. equi, 'S. equisimilis' including 'S. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of Lancefield Group B strains of human origin); (g) parapyogenic species group (S. uberis, 'S. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of Lancefield Groups R, S and T). Species of Aerococcus, Gemella, Leuconostoc and Pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
TI  - Production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from Staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  - Staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. These strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of Staphylococcus aureus FDA209P. The frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. Strain IYS2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. IYS2 was identified to be S. aureus, based on its biological properties. The bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. Its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. The isoelectric point was 10.0. In amino acid composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. The bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. The bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. An analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that Streptococcus salivarius, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium parvulum, and Actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacterionema matruchotii, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. The majority of S. aureus tested were susceptible, and all Staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.
TI  - Prevalence of Streptococcus mutans with different colonial morphologies in human  plaque and saliva.
AB  - Plaque and saliva samples were obtained twice from 58 children at an interval of  1 year and examined for the prevalence of Streptococcus mutans on Mitis salivarius (MS) and Mitis salivarius bacitracin (MSB) agar. Two types of S. mutans colonies with different colonial morphologies were seen on both media. They were serologically identified as serotypes c/e/f and d/g respectively. The first type, morphogroup c/e/f, had the typical "frosted-glass" appearance. It was the most prevalent and was found in 97% of the children. The second type, morphogroup d/g, had a creamy marzipan consistency with a dull, granular surface, gray to brown in color and often with some liquid around or on top of the colony. Group d/g was detected in 21 children (36%) and then together with colonies of group c/e/f. Children infected with single or multiple morphogroups of S. mutans generally harbored the same groups 1 year later. There was a significant positive correlation between the proportion of S. mutans in plaque and their numbers in saliva.
TI  - Predominant cultivable microflora of plaque on removable dentures in patients with healthy oral mucosa.
AB  - Plaque from the fitting surface of upper full dentures in eight patients with healthy palatal mucosa was studied. To characterize the predominant cultivable flora, 916 isolates (100-128 from each sample) were subcultured from anaerobic roll-tubes. Streptococci constituted 0-81 per cent (median, 41 per cent) of the isolates with varying proportions of Streptococcus milleri, Streptoccus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitior and Streptococcus sanguis. Staphylococcus aureus made up 0-13 per cent (median, 6 per cent). Gram-positive rods constituted 1-74 per cent (median, 33 per cent). Among these, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces odontolyticus were the most common species, whereas lactobacilli were isolated only from two samples, constituting 21 and 48 per cent. Among Gram-negative bacteria, only Veillonella parvula was common, constituting 3-20 per cent (median, 10 per cent). Gram-negative rods were isolated only from three samples in small proportions making up 0-6 per cent (median, 0 per cent) of the flora. Forty-seven isolates (5 per cent) were lost. Cultures for yeasts on Sabouraud agar were positive for five samples and the yeast counts corresponded to 0-0.45 per cent (median, 0.002 per cent) of the total viable counts. The microflora of denture plaque is highly variable and is to a large extent similar to that of some forms of dental plaque.
TI  - Activation of rutin by human oral bacterial isolates to the carcinogen-mutagen quercetin.
AB  - Oral streptococci, isolated from the mouths of 2 healthy subjects, hydrolysed innocuous rutin, a flavonoid glycoside, to its genotoxic aglycon quercetin, in vitro. The isolates were identified as Streptococcus milleri. The glycosidase, rutinase, was studied in cell-free extracts derived from one of the isolates, grown anaerobically in batch cultures by the use of a bioassay, the Ames test, in which S-9 was replaced by the cell-free extracts. This streptococcal rutinase was: constitutive, partly inducible, cytosolic, most active for rutin and most active at pH 6.5. Type-culture collection strains of other oral streptococci (Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 25975 and Streptococcus mutans strain 6715-10) showed no capacity for rutin degradation. A hypothesis for a novel role of the oral microflora in a disease process other than caries and periodontal disease, namely intra-oral cancer, is presented. The possibility of a bacterial liberation of the genotoxic quercetin in situ could be but one example of its involvement in the local carcinogenic process.
TI  - Inhibition by the antimicrobial agent chlorhexidine of acid production and sugar  transport in oral streptococcal bacteria.
AB  - Oral streptococci transport sugars via the phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase (PEP-PTS) system. In a specific assay of this system, low concentrations of chlorhexidine abolished the activity of the glucose and sucrose PTS in batch-grown cells of Streptococcus mutans Ingbritt and B13, Strep. sanguis NCTC 7865, Strep. mitis ATCC 903, Strep. milleri NCTC 10709 and Strep. salivarius NCTC 8606. Intact cells and cells made permeable to the assay reagents with toluene were used. Toluenized cells were more sensitive to chlorhexidine than intact cells (0.09 and 0.25 mM, respectively). This PTS-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine reduced acid production from glucose in pH fall experiments to values higher than are obtained solely from endogenous metabolism. The effect of chlorhexidine on rates of acid production was determined at pH 7.0 using cells washed with either 135 mM NaCl or 135 mM KCl. In general, faster rates of acid production from the metabolism of glucose and sucrose were obtained with potassium-treated cells. Addition of the PTS-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine markedly reduced or totally abolished acid production by NaCl-treated cells; a greater residual-activity was detected in the same cells washed with KCl (except with Strep. mutans B13 and Strep. mitis ATCC 903). The PTS-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine had little or no effect on the viability of cells. The results confirm the existence of sugar uptake systems in oral streptococci additional to the PTS and provide an explanation for the additive anti-caries effect of mouth-rinses containing both fluoride and chlorhexidine.
TI  - A selective medium for the two major subgroups of the bacterium Streptococcus mutans isolated from human dental plaque and saliva.
AB  - A selective medium was developed on which both major subgroups of Strep. mutans (c/e/f and d/g) can be cultured and recognized on the basis of colonial morphology, Trypticase, yeast, cystine (TYC) agar was modified by adding separately autoclaved sucrose to a final concentration of 20 per cent and 0.1 unit/ml bacitracin (TYCSB). This medium yielded significantly higher counts of Strep. mutans than the widely used mitis-salivarius bacitracin (MSB) medium.
TI  - Inhibition by acarbose, nojirimycin and 1-deoxynojirimycin of glucosyltransferase produced by oral streptococci.
AB  - Acarbose is known to inhibit glucoamylase, maltase and sucrase. Our aim was to test whether it would also inhibit glucosyltransferase (GTF), to determine the type of inhibition and to compare the inhibitor potency of acarbose with that of nojirimycin and deoxynojirimycin, two other glucosidase inhibitors. Enzyme inhibition was measured either by chemical assay or by incorporation of radioactivity into product. Acarbose effectively inhibited the synthesis of polysaccharide by GTF from strains of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis, but not by fructosyltransferase from Streptococcus salivarius. Acarbose and 1-deoxynojirimycin were more potent inhibitors of GTF than maltose, nojirimycin or various amino sugars. The mechanism of action of these compounds is consistent with competitive inhibition.
TI  - An improved method for measuring aggregation of certain streptococcal bacteria found in dental plaque.
AB  - Various cells were incubated with either dextran or sucrose and the reaction was  terminated by the addition of a 20 per cent solution of formaldehyde. A reaction mixture consisting of cells and aggregated cells was applied to a step-gradient glycerol column (0-60 per cent) and 0.5 ml fractions were collected from the bottom of the column. Non-aggregated cells remained in the top layer of the column. Aggregated cells settled in the 30 per cent glycerol layer as determined by either spectrophotometric or radioactive methods. The amount of aggregated cells demonstrated in this layer increased with either incubation time or concentration of sucrose, dextran or cells. Cells of Strep, mutans strains 6715, AHT, 10449, OMZ-176, OMZ-175 and two mutants of Strep. mutans strain 6715 (designated C4 and C307) aggregated strongly. Cells of Strep. mutans strain LM7 aggregated weakly, whereas cells of Strep. mutans 6715 mutant UAB165, a mutant defective in aggregation. Strep. mutans strain BHT, Strep. salivarius and Strep. sanguis did not aggregate in the presence of either sucrose or dextran. Experiments testing co-aggregation between two different types of cells were done by using 3H-labelled and 14C-labelled cells. Strep. mutans strain 6715 co-aggregated with Strep. sanguis in the presence of sucrose or dextran, whereas Strep. mutans strain 6715 did not aggregate with Strep. salivarius. The method separates aggregated from non-aggregated cells and enables quantitation of sucrose- or dextran-induced aggregation and co-aggregation.
TI  - [Viridans streptococci in human infections: identification and susceptibility to  antibiotics].
AB  - A method for the speciation of viridans streptococci (devoided of group antigens) is described. The major identification criteria are based on the reaction of a series of biochemical tests such as acid production in lactose, inuline, raffinose, mannitol and sorbitol, hydrolysis of arginine, esculin and Na hippurate, and production of polysaccharides in 5% sucrose media. A total of 460 strains were isolated from human specimens and identified as follows: 118 Streptococcus mitis, 102 S. sanguis II, 75 S. Sanguis I, 87 S. milleri (Streptococcus MG-intermedius), 28 S. mutans, 25 S. salivarius, 14 S. morbillorium, 2 S. uberis and 9 unspeciated. Susceptibility to antibiotics was studied for 318 strains: 63% of them were susceptible to all drugs tested; 37% of the strains were resistant to one or several antibiotics as follows: 34% to tetracycline, 8.5% to macrolides and related drugs, 5.3% to streptomycin and/or kanamycin (MIC greater than 2,000 micrograms/ml), 5% to penicillin (MIC = 1-4 micrograms/ml) and 4% to chloramphenicol.
TI  - Common antigens of streptococcal and non-streptococcal oral bacteria: isolation and biochemical characterization of the extracellular protein antigen.
AB  - An extracellular soluble common protein (ECP) has been purified from extracellular soluble fractions of exponential phase cultures of Streptococcus sanguis OMZ9, of a representative strain of each of Bratthall's seven serological groups of Streptococcus mutans, and of one strain each of Lactobacillus salivarius and Actinomyces viscosus. The ECP antigens from the different strains were prepared from SDS-dissociated immunoprecipitates by affinity chromatography on an anti-rabbit immunoglobulin column. The identity of such purified ECP antigens was demonstrated by their behaviour in immunodiffusion analysis, in SDS-PAGE, in which an identical molecular weight (60000) was found, and by virtue of their similar amino acid and sugar compositions. This common antigen (ECP) consisted of 90% protein and 10% sugar.
TI  - Predominant cultivable microflora of human dental fissure plaque.
AB  - Plaque developed in 10 occlusal fissures from unerupted third molars during implantation for 200 to 270 days in lower molars of dental students was studied. To characterize the predominant cultivable flora, 592 isolates (51 to 67 from each fissure) were subcultured from anaerobic roll tubes. Twenty-eight of the isolates were lost. Streptococci constituted 8 to 86% (median, 45%) of the isolates, Streptococcus mutans constituted 0 to 86% (median, 25%) and S. sanguis constituted 0 to 15% (median, 1%). A few isolates of "S. mitior" and "S. milleri" were found, but no S. salivarius. Staphylococci made up 0 to 23% (median, 9%). Gram-positive rods constituted 6 to 59% (median, 35%). Of these, 0 to 46% (median, 18%) were Actinomyces naeslundii and A. viscosus, but no anaerobic actinomyces were isolated. Arachnia and propionibacteria made up small proportions, lactobacilli were isolated from two fissures, constituting 10 and 29%, and eubacteria were isolated from one fissure (27%). Gram-negative cocci made up 0 to 46% (media, 4%). Only two isolates of gram-negative rods were found, both facultative anaerobes. Although 8 of the 10 fissures had large proportions of S. mutans, lactobacilli, or both, no caries was found even with microradiography. The large individual variation probably reflects differences in initial colonization from saliva and in growth conditions in each fissure.
TI  - Effect of mechanical and chemical plaque control measures on oral microflora in schoolchildren.
AB  - The incidence of S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. mutans, total streptococci and lactobacilli was examined in highly caries active 13-14-year-old schoolchildren participating in a prophylactic program. After 1 year of trial, professional toothcleaning once every second week markedly reduced the frequency of gingivitis and the caries increment. Bimonthly topical applications of a 0.5% chlorhexidine gel with or without subsequent rinsing with 2% NFP had no effect on plaque score and gingivitis but tended to reduce the caries activity. No significant changes were found in the groups with regard to the salivary number of total streptococci and S. sanguis. A reduction of the population of S. salivarius, S. mutans and lactobacilli was observed in the chlorhexidine group. In the group where chlorhexidine was combined with MFP, only S. mutans was reduced.
TI  - Microbial populations growing in the presence of fluoride at low pH isolated from dental plaque of children living in an area with fluoridated water.
AB  - Longitudinal microbiological examinations have been made of dental plaque from a  site approximal to the upper central incisors of 10 8-year-old children living in an area with water fluoridation. Differential counts of viable bacteria, made using a selective medium containing various levels of fluoride (0 to 100 mug/ml) at pH levels of 7.0 to 5.5, demonstrated an effect of both pH and fluoride on the numbers and types of bacteria isolated. Strains of Streptococcus and Neisseria grew after only 16 h of incubation at pH levels as low as 6.0 with fluoride levels up to 50 mug/ml. The most commonly isolated streptococci were Streptococcus mitior and S. salivarius. S. mutans was isolated less frequently and was inhibited by 20 and 50 mug of fluoride per ml at pH 6.0 and 6.5, respectively. Veillonella strains were the most resistant isolates, being isolated after 16 h of incubation on media at pH 6.0 with 100 mug of fluoride per ml. Despite their known fluoride resistance, Actinomyces spp. were often only detected on the selective media after 72 h of incubation. The pH of the medium had a definite selective effect, as the number of colonies growing on the fluoride-free basal media at pH 6.0 was only 30% of that at pH 7.0. Representative strains of S. mutans, S. mitior, S. sanguis, and S. milleri were tested for their ability to utilize glucose at the pH and fluoride levels of the medium on which they were initially isolated. Fluoride reduced the initial glycolytic rate of the cells, but in 5 of the 13 strains tested the final amount of glucose used after 2 h of incubation was the same in the presence or absence of fluoride. The isolation of bacteria capable of growth in the presence of fluoride over a significant portion of the pH range that occurs in plaque in vivo could explain in part the finding that fluoride does not have a dramatic effect on the plaque community. Fluoride in plaque may reduce the ecological advantage afforded to aciduric S. mutans strains by carbohydrate substances. In the in vivo situation this could mean that, even with high carbohydrate intake, fluoride may permit S. mitior to compete with S. mutans within the plaque ecosystem.
TI  - Adsorption of lysozyme from human whole saliva by Streptococcus sanguis 903 and other oral microorganisms.
AB  - Several strains of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, and Actinomyces naeslundii plus fresh isolates of Streptococcus salivarius were surveyed for their abilities to deplete lysozyme from human-whole-saliva supernatant. Bacteria were incubated in saliva for 60 min at 37 degrees C and then removed by centrifugation, and the recovered supernatant solutions were assayed for lysozyme activity by using whole cells of Micrococcus lysodeikticus as the substrate. Mean lysozyme depletions by bacterial strains varied over a wide (eightfold) range. The greatest mean depletion of lysozyme (60 to 70%) was observed with S. sanguis (biotype I), serotype b of S. mutans, and the fresh S. salivarius isolates. The lowest mean depletion was noted with S. mitis (15%) and biotype II S. sanguis (ca. 30%). The remaining species and strains exhibited an intermediate degree of depletion. In studies with S. sanguis 903, lysozyme was depleted by normal or heated (90 degrees C, 30 min) bacteria and could be recovered from the organism. Furthermore, under appropriate conditions, lysozyme depletion by cells at 0 and 37 degrees C was very similar. On the basis of these observations, we concluded that depletion was due to the adsorption of lysozyme by the organism. With S. sanguis 903, lysozyme adsorption depended on the concentration of bacteria, time of incubation, and the ionic strength of the medium. The extent of adsorption, however, was independent of pH's of 3.9 to 8.3. When a low concentration of S. sanguis 903 was used, lysozyme adsorption reached saturation (4 mug of adsorbed lysozyme per 10(7) cells) at 20 mug of lysozyme added per ml. Salivary lysozyme adsorption by several other oral microorganisms (A. viscosus WVU 626 and WVU 627, S. sanguis 73x11, S. mutans BHT, and S. salivarius NG) was similar to that of S. sanguis 903 in sensitivity to ionic strength. Lysozyme adsorption by S. sanguis 903 from either a buffer solution or a saliva supernatant was more sensitive to ionic strength at 0 than at 37 degrees C. On the basis of results from experiments in saliva versus buffer, we concluded that saliva had no major effect on the extent of lysozyme adsorption by S. sanguis 903 other than providing a source of ionic strength. A comparison of pH and ionic strength effects on lysozyme adsorption by S. sanguis 903 with literature reports of lysozyme lysis of whole cells and hydrolysis of cell walls, peptidoglycan, and (GlcNAc)(4) suggested that adsorption by S. sanguis 903 was more dependent on electrostatic interactions than was lysozyme catalysis. The possibility is discussed that anionic bacterial surface components mediate lysozyme adsorption and temper the potential effects of lysozyme on the microorganisms.
TI  - Purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - An inhibition factor from Streptococcus mutans strain C3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. Bacteriocin C3603 is a basic protein with a pI value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. The activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by pH over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees C for 10 min at pH 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees C for 15 min at pH 4.0. Pronase; papain, phospholipase C, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. Bacteriocin activity was greater against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and f than against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. Bacteriocin C3603 was also effective against selected strains of S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. bovis, S. faecium, S. lactis, Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, Propionibacterium acnes, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Corynebacterium parvum, and Candida albicans. The inhibition of S. mutans strains BHT and PS-14 by bacteriocin C3603 was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. When water or a diet containing bacteriocin C3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with S. mutans PS-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
TI  - Oral flora of children with "nursing bottle caries".
AB  - S. mutans averaged about 60% of the total cultivable flora of dental plaque obtained from caries lesions, white spot margins of these lesions, or clinically-sound areas of upper anterior teeth, and averaged about 27% in plaque from mostly clinically-sound areas of posterior teeth of six children with nursing bottle caries; its concentrations in saliva averaged about 10% of the total cultivable flora. Nearly all of 107 isolated S. mutans strains belonged to the serotype group c/e/f. The proportion of S. sanguis, in contrast to those of S. mutans, were very low in plaque from upper anterior teeth and higher in plaque from posterior teeth. The proportions of S. salivarius in saliva were unusually low, and this organism was not detected in the saliva of most subjects. Lactobacilli were found in nearly all plaque samples; plaque and carious material from cavities contained higher levels than plaque associated with white spots or clinically-sound tooth surfaces. The findings provide further support for the role of S. mutans in the initiation of human dental caries. In the case of lactobacilli, they support other evidence suggesting only the limited involvement of these organisms in the initiation of caries lesions, but a more extensive role in their progression. In addition, they clearly illustrate the marked effect of diet on the dental plaque flora.
TI  - Comparison of computer methods for taxonomy of some streptococci using gas chromatographic chemotaxonomic data.
AB  - Gas chromatographic fingerprints of eighty-three strains of Streptococcus were analysed by computer. Seven measures of association were compared for their ability to identify strains. The most effective measure was the Stack coefficient which correctly identified 68% of strains, mostly of oral origin. Clustering of strains was carried out by median, average, single-linkage, furthest neighbour, and centroid linkage, Andrew's plots, and Minimum Spanning Trees. Of the clustering methods, centroid linkage produced the most inclusive and compact clusters. Clusters of strains of S. mitis, S. mutans, S. salivarius and S. sanguis showed varying degrees of heterogeneity; while, S. milleri was comprised of three chemotypes corresponding to oral isolates, biochemically atypical vaginal isolates, and biochemically typical strains from other sources.
TI  - The streptococcal flora of the tongue of the monkey Macaca fascicularis.
AB  - The major streptococcal biotypes in the 8 monkeys investigated resembled Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mitior with Streptococcus salivarius forming only 5 to 6 per cent of the total colony count and being isolated from only 4 monkeys. The predominant tongue streptococci were not isolated from the dental plaque. Similarly, Streptococcus mutans, present in large numbers in the plaque of monkeys fed sucrose-rich diets, was isolated from the tongue of only 2 animals and formed only 2.4 per cent of the total colony count. Changing from a starch-based maintenance diet to sucrose-rich diets did not significantly alter the tongue flora except that the proportion of typical Strep. sanguis was significantly reduced. The oral streptococcal flora of monkeys is similar in distribution to that found in the human mouth.
TI  - Influence of in vitro propagation on the adhesive qualities of Streptococcus mutans isolated from saliva.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans from saliva of one test person were isolated on mitis/salivarius agar containing bacitracin and extra sucrose, and subcultured in vitro on trypticase soy broth with numerous transfers. Freshly isolated organisms and bacteria from selected subcultures were studied in adhesion tests using glass or dental zinc phosphate cement as substrate. Different bacterial isolates were used in separate experiments. Three different techniques were used; two based on radioactivity assays of adhering 3H-thymidine-labelled bacteria, and one based on visual counting. With all three techniques freshly isolated S. mutans adhered in significant numbers. It was consistently found that their ability to adhere decreased with the number of in vitro transfers. The results support the view that growth condition is an important factor governing the adhesive properties of oral bacteria.
TI  - A comparative study of enzymes involved in glucose phosphorylation in oral streptococci.
AB  - The properties of two enzymes involved in the phosphorylation of glucose were studied in three oral streptococci species. The glucokinase of Streptococcus mutans had a lower affinity for glucose and ATP than did those from S. salivarius and S. sanguis. The enzyme had an identical pH optimum (pH 8.0) in all three bacteria. However, the result from the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system showed a different pattern when its activity was measured using 2-deoxyglucose with toluenized cells. Uptake studies of 2-deoxyglucose also revealed that the three microorganisms had different affinities for this compound. This glucose analogue strongly inhibited the acid production of S. salivarius, but did not affect the glycolysis of the other two bacteria.
TI  - Factors affecting the in-vitro adherence of the fungal oral pathogen Candida albicans to epithelial cells of human origin.
AB  - An in-vitro technique was used to investigate the effects of oral commensal bacteria, serum, saliva, germ-tube formation and pH on the adherence of two strains of C. albicans to HeLa cells. Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus mitior reduced candidal adhesion whereas Streptococcus mutans had no significant effect. A mixed salivary pellicle on HeLa cells significantly enhanced candidal adhesion and a serum layer had no effect. Yeasts pre-incubated in whole saliva for 3 h showed significantly greater adhesion to HeLa and human embryonic kidney epithelial cells than yeasts in phosphate-buffered saline. The adherence of hyphal phase candida was significantly greater than in the blastospore phase. Adhesion varied with the pH of the test medium, maximal adherence was at pH 3 with less under neutral pH conditions. The factors involved in the adhesion of C. albicans to epithelial surfaces are complex and may play a role in the aetiopathology of human mucosal candidoses.
TI  - Enolases from fluoride-sensitive and fluoride-resistant streptococci.
AB  - The enolase from a highly fluoride-sensitive strain of Streptococcus salivarius and its fluoride-resistant mutant, as well as those from strains of Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans with intermediate and low sensitivities to fluoride have been shown to be inhibited by fluoride. Comparisons of the purified, strain-specific enzymes showed a high degree of similarity for all preparations. The Michaelis constants for the substrate 2-phosphoglycerate were 1.3 x 10(-4) to 2.4 x 10(-4) M, pH optima were 7.3 to 7.7, and Mg2+ optima were 2 mEq/liter for all. Inhibition by fluoride required the presence of inorganic phosphate and was competitive in nature, and the calculated modified inhibition indices were found to be in the range from 3.3 x 10(-14) to 5.8 x 10(-14) M4. Percent inhibitions were determined under standardized conditions (0.16 mM NaF, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.5 mM Pi, and 0.5 mM 2-phosphoglycerate) and were found to range from 53.3 to 65.9% for all of the purified enzymes. The differences do not appear to be meaningful metabolically. Inhibition was reduced to about 14% at pH 6.0. From the similarities in the behavior of the strain-specific enzymes it is concluded that the differences in the glycolytic sensitivities of the different strains of streptococci to fluoride are not the consequence of any kinetic differences between the respective enolases.
TI  - Examination of Streptococcus mutans for immunoglobulin G Fc reactivity.
AB  - Representative strains of oral streptococci were tested for Fc immunoglobulin G (IgG) reactivity by two different techniques, agglutination of rabbit-IgG sensitized sheep erythrocytes and uptake of human and rabbit 125I-radiolabeled IgG. None of the S. mutans serotypes a through e reacted with the Fc region of either human or rabbit IgG. Additionally, other streptococci such as S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. faecalis, and S. mitis failed to show appreciable Fc reactivity as assayed by these techniques. The group A, C, and G streptococci, previously shown to possess Fc reactivity, proved to be reactive in these experiments, as did a protein A-containing strain of Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Sucrose-induced ecological response of experimental dental plaques from caries-free and caries-susceptible Human volunteers.
AB  - Microbial succession, experimental cariogenicity, and sucrose metabolism were examined in dental plaques which developed on sterile bovine enamel inserts in acrylic palatal appliances. The appliances were worn for a period of 14 days by 10 caries-free and 10 caries-susceptible human volunteers. Three of six enamel inserts on each appliance were exposed extraorally to 10% sucrose in 0.85% saline six times a day, and three were exposed simultaneously to 0.85% saline as a control environment. The responses of the plaques to the high-sucrose environment in both caries status populations were compared. In all plaques, exposure to 10% sucrose stimulated the succession of Veillonella spp., Lactobacillus spp., Streptococcus salivarius, and, to a lesser extent, Streptococcus mutans and a decline in levels of Streptococcus sanguis, Neisseria spp., and gram-negative anaerobic rods. Plaques from caries-free mouths, in contrast to those from caries-susceptible mouths, harbored higher levels of Veillonella spp., gram-negative anaerobic rods, and Neisseria spp. and lower levels of Lactobacillus spp. Sucrose-exposed plaques from caries-free mouths also induced less enamel microhardness changes and formed less lactic acid from [14C]sucrose during a 60-min incubation at 37 degrees C than did comparable plaques from caries-susceptible mouths. The experiments revealed consistent differences in the ecological response to a cariogenic substrate environment in plaques from the two populations, with plaques from caries-free subjects exhibiting less cariogenic potential than those from caries-susceptible subjects.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of Streptococcus mutans mutants defective in adherence and aggregation.
AB  - A method was developed which enriched for mutants of Streptococcus mutans that exhibit defects in adherence to glass, aggregation, or both. Mutants were isolated from derivatives of strains PS14 (serotype c) and 6715 (serotype g) after mutagenesis with either ethyl methane sulfonate or nitrous acid. Cell survival after mutagenesis was kept above 1 to 2% to enhance the probability that mutants resulted from single mutational events. A total of 117 mutants were isolated; they also displayed non-wild-type colony morphology on mitis salivarius agar. These mutants were examined for (i) adherence and aggregation after overnight growth in sucrose-containing medium, (ii) aggregation of nongrowing cells in the presence of 200 microgram of sucrose per ml or 20 microgram of dextran per ml, and (iii) dextranase production on blue dextran agar plates. Although we isolated mutants which exhibited a variation from the parent strain in only one of the traits tested, the majority of mutants exhibited defects in two or more characteristics. Thirty-eight stable mutants of independent origin were categorized into 13 separate phenotypic groups.
TI  - Bacteriocin production by Streptococcus salivarius strain P.
AB  - A bacteriocin, streptococcin sal-P, was isolated by freeze-thaw elution from cultures of Streptococcus salivarius strain P grown on tryptic soy agar plus 1% neopeptone. The inhibitor could also be extracted with either 7 M urea of 1 M NaCl from cells grown on this medium, but little activity was recovered from cells grown in liquid media of from the supernatants of these cultures. Streptococcin sal-P was found to be a proteinaceous substance of molecular weight approximately 8000. It was remarkably stable at extremes of pH or temperature and appeared to adsorb nonspecifically to both sensitive and resistant bacterial cells and also to cellulose membranes. The range of its inhibitory activity was almost entirely against Gram-positive bacteria, particularly streptococci, including strains of S. pyogenes and S. sanguis, but not S. mutans or group D streptococci. Streptococcin sal-P was bactericidal for actively metabolizing susceptible strains.
TI  - Bacterial aggregating activity in human saliva: comparisons of bacterial species  and strains.
AB  - Using a quantitative assay to measure saliva-mediated bacterial aggregating activity, we have surveyed 20 streptococcal strains with saliva samples obtained from a large population study. Individual saliva samples demonstrated characteristic levels of aggregating activity for Streptococcus sanguis M5. In general, high activity for this strain was associated with high activity for other strains of S. sanguis. Streptococcus mitis, and Streptococcus salivarius. The population distribution of aggregating activity for Streptococcus mutans, however, was different.
TI  - Interference of secretory immunoglobulin A with sorption of oral bacteria to hydroxyapatite.
AB  - The potential of secretory immunoglobulin A (S-IgA) to interfere with the initial phase of dental plaque formation was studied by using an in vitro method which permits the quantitative determination of the sorption of radiolabeled oral bacterial cells to hydroxyapatite (HA) beads. The importance of specific S-IgA antibodies was evaluated by a comparison of the effect of pure preparations of colostral S-IgA, polymeric myeloma IgA, or preabsorbed S-IgA. Specific antibody molecules bound at the HA surface significantly enhanced the sorption of two Streptococcus sanguis strains. In contrast, HA-bound S-IgA antibodies inhibited the sorption of Streptococcus mitior and Streptococcus salivarius. The same was true for Streptococcus mutans cells, but only when they were propagated in the absence of sucrose. Suspended in saliva, cells of all streptococcal species adhered in significantly lower numbers to HA. Comparative experiments with bacteria suspended in solutions of various preparations of IgA or immunoglobulin-deficient salivas with S-IgA or myeloma IgA added indicated that the adherence inhibition seen with S. Sanguis, S. mitior, S. salivarius, and glucose-grown S. mutans was partly attributable to functions of S-IgA antibodies. Under the in vitro conditions of the study, S-IgA antibodies had no effect on the sorption of sucrose-grown S. mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, and Actinomyces naeslundii to HA. The results indicated that S-IgA can interfere with the sorption of some oral bacteria to HA by several different functions.
TI  - Common antigens of streptococcal and non-streptococcal oral bacteria: immunochemical studies of extracellular and cell-wall-associated antigens from Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Actinomyces viscosus.
AB  - Soluble extracellular antigens (ESA) were prepared from the culture supernatant of exponential growing cells of Streptococcus sanguis OMZ 9 by a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography on a Bio-Gel P6 column. Soluble cell wall antigens (WEA) were obtained from the bacterial pellet by extraction with 1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6). Antisera against whole cells of S. sanguis and S. mutans of different serotypes, 10% trichloroacetic extracts of bacterial cell walls, dextran, ESA, and WEA were prepared by injecting the different antigens several times in rabbits. ESA and WEA were prepared from a representative strain of Bratthall's seven serological groups, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Actinomyces viscosus. All sera showed various agglutinin titers against heat-killed cells, and titers were generally higher with homologous cells. The comparison of the different antigens using agar gel diffusion and immunoelectrophoresis showed the presence of extracellular common antigens in both ESA and WEA between the different strains. Absorption of anti-ESA sera with WEA, and anti-WEA sera with ESA, showed the existence of a specific antigen common to all bacteria in each fraction. Enzymatic treatment of the antigen before immunodiffusion demonstrated the protein nature of the two antigens present in ESA and WEA.
TI  - Virulence-related physiological changes and antigenic variation in populations of Streptococcus mutans colonizing gnotobiotic rats.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine if populations of Streptococcus mutans which were undergoing antigenic variation while colonizing gnotobiotic rats concomitantly became altered in physiological characteristics which affected their virulence. S. mutans strain JBP (serotype c), which was freshly isolated from a carious lesion in a 6-year old child, was used to inoculate gnotobiotic rats; uninfected animals served as controls. Substrains were isolated from animals 1, 2, 3, 4, and 12 weeks after infection; samples of pilocarpine-stimulated saliva were also obtained from representative animals for antibody analyses. Isolates derived from stock cultures of strain JBP proved to be homogeneous with respect to all of the physiological characteristics monitored. However, substrains isolated from the animals within 4 weeks after infection were altered with respect to their ability to agglutinate in the presence of sucrose, their ability to form adherent growth in sucrose broth, and the terminal pH attained in glucose broth. Some isolates obtained 12 weeks after infection no longer synthesized detectable levels of c antigen or intracellular glycogen, and they formed atypical smooth colonies on mitis salivarius agar. With an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, low levels of immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies reactive with whole JBP cells were detected in saliva samples of uninfected control animals at each sampling period; these evidently were induced to antigens contained in the diet of the animals. Significantly higher levels of IgA antibodies were present in saliva samples from animals infected with strain JBP for 3 weeks or longer. Thus, the emergence of antigenic and physiological variants of S. mutans in the animals was paralleled by increased levels of salivary IgA antibodies. The reactivity of salivary IgG with JBP cells was low, and it fluctuated in both groups of animals. No antibodies of the IgM class were detected. When tested in gnotobiotic rats, several variants, including strains which no longer formed typical rough colonies or adherent growth in sucrose broth, proved much less virulent than parental strain JBP in inducing carious lesions. Prior oral immunization, which resulted in higher levels of salivary and serum IgA antibodies reactive with strain JBP, was found to accelerate the emergence of smooth-colony variants in the animals; it was also associated with decreased streptococcal population levels on the teeth and in feces of the rats. It is suggested that part of the mechanism by which artificial immunization leads to a reduction in dental caries development in experimental animals is due to the earlier selection of less virulent streptococcal populations.
TI  - Role of bacterial interactions in the colonization of oral surfaces of Actinomyces viscosus.
AB  - The effects of several microbial residents of human oral cavities on the attachment of Actinomyces viscosus T14V to tooth surfaces were assessed by using the saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sHA) in vitro system. Attachment to sHA by A. viscosus T14V was not inhibited in the presence of Streptococcus mutans GS5, either in the presence or absence of sucrose. Precoating sHA beads with S. mutans in the presence of sucrose also did not retard strain T14V attachment. However, the presence of Streptococcus sanguis M5 during strain T14V attachment markedly inhibited the interaction of A. viscosus T14V with sHA, whereas another S. sanguis strain, strain G9B, produced relatively weak inhibition. The inhibitory effect of S. sanguis M5 appeared to result from the direct interaction of this organism with A. viscosus T14V. Conversely, the presence of strain T14V markedly increased the attachment of S. sanguis M5 to sHA while partially inhibiting the attachment of S. sanguis G9B. Moreover, sHA beads precoated with A. viscosus T14V bound much higher levels of S. sanguis M5 relative to uncoated sHA, whereas S. sanguis G9B attachment was only weakly inhibited. It was also observed that sHA beads precoated with either S. sanguis M5 or G9B inhibited subsequent attachment by strain T14V. These results suggest the possibility that the attachment sites for both S. sanguis strains partially overlap those for A. viscosus T14V. Streptococcus mitis weakly inhibited attachment of strain T14V to sHA, and both Streptococcus salivarius and Lactobacillus casei had little effect on attachment. In addition, both a radioisotope attachment assay and fluorescent microscopy demonstrated no significant attachment of A. viscosus T14V to human epithelial cells.
TI  - Cariogenicity of human oral lactobacilli in hamsters.
AB  - Of 50 strains of lactobacilli isolated from dental plaque of school children, two strains, provisionally identified as Lactobacillus salivarius, and one strain, provisionally identified as Lactobacillus fermentum, induced significant caries activity in conventional hamsters. Sucrose was a required dietary cariogenic substrate and could not be replaced with glucose or starch. In contrast to cariogenic strains of Streptococcus mutans the active lactobacilli did not form adherent sucrose-mediated plaques in vitro, did not form intracellular iodophilic polysaccharides and did not form detectable insoluble extracellular polyglucans.
TI  - Isolation and serotyping of Streptococcus mutans from teeth and feces of children.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans were detected in the feces from 10 of 29 caries-active patients, aged 4 to 9 years. The percentage of S. mutans to the total counts of facultatively anaerobic streptococci on mitis salivarius agar (Difco Laboratories) varied from 0 to 72.5%. S. mutans were then isolated from dental plaque of sound teeth and carious dentin of the 10 subjects known to harbor S. mutans in the feces. The frequency distribution of various serotypes of these dental and fecal isolates of S. mutans was compared by the immunodiffusion technique. Of the total 1,047 isolates (290 isolates from feces, 289 from dental plaque, and 468 from carious dentin), type c isolates were most prevalent (ca. 66%). Serotype d, e, f, and g isolates were also found but in far lower frequencies. Plural serotypes of S. mutans were occasionally found in dental and fecal samples of a single subject. For two subjects, relatively rare serotypes of S. mutans in the population examined, serotype e, f, or g, were predominantly found in their fecal and dental samples and those of their siblings and mother, suggesting an intrafamilial transmission of S. mutans.
TI  - Comparison of selective broth and plating methods for isolation of Streptococcus  mutans from root surface dental plaques.
AB  - Approximately 150 sound root surfaces in 44 subjects prone to root surface caries were sampled longitudinally to determine the microbial flora associated with root caries initiation. During the first 16 months of the study, a comparison of Streptococcus mutans recovery was made by using three bacteriological media: mitis-salivarius agar (MSA), mitis-salivarius-bacitracin-sucrose agar (MSB), and a partially selective mannitol-containing broth. Total streptococcal and S. mutans populations were found to be much lower than in previous reports. MSB was more selective; S. mutans was detected in many samples when its numbers were too low for isolation on MSA. However, recovery of S. mutans was greater on MSA than on MSB for most samples yielding colonies on both media. Mannitol-containing broth used as an enrichment medium yielded the highest frequency of S. mutans isolation among the three media.
TI  - Binding of streptococcal antigens to muscle tissue in vitro.
AB  - Antigens extracted from cells of Streptococcus pyogenes T6 and Streptococcus mutans strains AHT, BHT, 10449, OMZ175, and K1R adsorbed to the sarcolemmal sheath of cardiac muscle cells in vitro. Similar preparations from S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Lactobacillus casei had weak or negligible tissue-binding activity. Tissue-bound bacterial antigens were detected with homologous rabbit antisera with both indirect immunofluorescence tests and an indirect radioimmunoassay. Serological cross-reactivity was observed between the tissue-binding factors of S. pyogenes and S. mutans cells but not between the bacteria and muscle tissue. In a comparative study of extraction procedures, the greatest yield of tissue-binding factors was obtained from group A streptococci by cell disruption in buffer at 4 degrees C. Hot aqueous phenol and hot water extracts were inactive. Antibodies specific for the tissue-binding factor(s) were readily adsorbed from rabbit anti-S. pyogenes serum by a preparation of isolated cytoplasmic membranes but not by a suspension of cell wall fragments. The heart-binding component of S. pyogenes cell extracts was inactivated by protease digestion and heat treatment and to a lesser extent by periodic acid oxidation. The capacity of heart cell components to adsorb streptococcal antigens was reduced by protease treatment but not by the action of neuraminidase, hyaluronidase, organic solvents, or detergents.
TI  - Streptococcus mutans-like bacteria from human dental plaque in a Sri Lanka (Ceylon) population.
AB  - This paper reports on the presence of low numbers of Streptococcus mutans among the oral streptococci present in human dental plaque in a Sri Lanka (Ceylon) population, where the caries activity is low and a low sucrose intake is combined with the presence of heavy plaque deposits. Plaque samples of unknown age were collected from 10 individuals in a tea estate, and another 10 samples were collected from dental students 19 days following interruption of oral hygiene. Of 670 such strains of oral streptococci studied, none showed typical "frosted glass" colony morphology on Mitis Salivarius agar. However, when subjected to physiological tests 14 of them were classified as S. mutans.
TI  - Adherence of oral streptococci to keratinized and nonkeratinized human oral epithelial cells.
AB  - The ability of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis,  and Streptococcus salivarius to adhere to keratinized versus nonkeratinized human oral epithelial cells was compared. S. mitis and S. salivarius exhibited significantly greater adherence to keratinized cells than to nonkeratinized cells. S. mutans and S. sanguis adhered equally well to either epithelial cell type. It is concluded that keratinization of epithelial cells may be a significant factor in the adherence of certain oral streptococci to the oral mucosa.
TI  - An in vitro model for studying adsorption of oral streptococci to crown and bridge cements.
AB  - A sensitive, in vitro method has been developed for the study of bacterial adsorption to dental crown and bridge cements. The method employs heavily radiolabelled cells which adhere to the wall in wells made from the cements. Loss of radioactivity from the bacterial suspension during incubation is used to measure the degree of bacterial adherence to the materials. Strains of Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans adhered in greater numbers than a strain of Streptococcus salivarius to both a zinc phosphate cement and a zinc carboxylate cement. The zinc phosphate cement supported adherence to a greater degree than did the zinc carboxylate cement. Pretreatment of the cement surfaces with human saliva tended to reduce bacterial adherence. Pretreatment of the bacteria with saliva slightly enhanced sorption of S. sanguis and S. salivarius, but tended to impair sorption of S. mutans to both types of cements. When both bacteria and cements had been pretreated with saliva, a strong inhibition of the adherence of S. mutans was observed.
TI  - In vitro studies of dental plaque formation: adsorption of oral streptococci to hydroxyaptite.
AB  - A mixture of saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads and radioactively labeled bacteria has been employed as an in vitro model for the initial phase of dental plaque formation. Adsorption in this model can be expressed by the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, and the adherence of oral streptococci can be expressed as the product of the affinity constant (Ka) and the number of binding sites (N), KaN. With this approach, Streptococcus sanguis serotype 1 strains adhered better (KaN = [187 +/- 72] X 10(-2)) than serotype 2 strains (KaN = [97 +/- 84] X 10(-2)); a t test showed this difference to be statistically significant to the 99.99% confidence level. Strains of S. mitis, S. mutans, and S. salivarius did not appear to adhere as well. To analyze the bacterial receptors involved in adherence, competition studies in which increasing quantities of unlabeled bacteria were added to a fixed quantity (4 X 10(9) cells per ml) of 3H-labeled serotype 1, reference strain S. sanguis G9B, were performed. These studies indicated that the type 1 strains competed for the same, or closely related, binding sites. Competition studies using serotype 2 S. sanguis strains resulted in an increased binding of reference strain G9B to hydroxyapatite. Scanning electron microscopy indicated this effect was due to the formation of localized aggregations of bacteria, presumably representing the two bacterial types. The results of competition studies with S. mitis were variable, and several strains of other oral bacteria showed little or no competition.
TI  - Interactions between human serum proteins and oral streptococci reveal occurrence of receptors for aggregated beta 2-microglobulin.
AB  - A total of 31 strains of oral streptococci representing Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitior, Streptococcus salivarius, and Streptococcus milleri were tested for possible binding of human immunoglobulins G, G1, G2, G3, G4, A1, A2, M1, and M2 and haptoglobin, hemoglobin, fibrinogen, and aggregated beta 2-microglobulin. Radiolabeled beta 2-microglobulin in aggregated form showed affinity for 20 of the 31 strains tested. Binding activity for the protein was found in strains belonging to all five species. The bacterial receptor was resistant to trypsin. Monomeric, unlabeled beta 2-microglobulin did not interfere with the binding of the aggregated form. Of the other proteins tested, only the immunoglobulin A1 protein showed positive binding, and that was only with a single strain of S. milleri. beta 2-Microglobulin is present on all nucleated cell membranes in vivo. The reaction between aggregated beta 2-microglobulin and oral streptococci is a new type of human-bacterium interaction which should be considered in studies of bacterial adherence.
TI  - Structure of extracellular water-soluble polysaccharides synthesized from sucrose by oral strains of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces viscosus.
AB  
TI  - Bacterial and strain specificities in opsonization, phagocytosis and killing of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Opsonization of Streptococcus mutans, followed by phagocytosis and killing by polymorphonuclear leucocytes has been postulated as an effector mechanism in protection against dental caries. Opsonization was studied by using sera from monkeys immunized with killed Strep. mutans (sero-type c) and compared with sera from sham-immunized monkeys. Antibodies to Strep. mutans (sero-type c) induced maximal phagocytosis and killing of serotypes c and e, and this was significantly greater than with serotypes a and d; there was no significant phagocytosis or killing of serotype b. There was little or no opsonization with Actinomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus casei, Strep, sanguis and Strep. salivarius. The exception was Strep. CHT which showed significant phagocytosis and killing. The results suggest that immunization with the serotype c strain of Strep. mutans might offer protection against four of the five common serotypes of this organism.
TI  - Selective binding of blood group-reactive salivary mucins by Streptococcus mutans and other oral organisms.
AB  - Strains of Streptococcus mutans of four genetic groups and five serotypes, and strains of S. sanguis, S. mitis, S. salivarius, Actinomyces naeslundii, and A. viscosus, were found to bind blood group-reactive (BGR) mucin isolated from whole human saliva. The bacteria studied bound mucins with blood type A or B reactivity to a similar extent, suggesting that the carbohydrate moieties responsible for the A and B antigenic determinants were not involved. The organisms studied appeared to bind different fractions of BGR mucin molecules because preparations absorbed with cells of a given oral species no longer contained BGR molecules which bound to homologous organisms but still possessed BGR components which bound to varying degrees to other bacteria. Differences were even noted among S. mutans strains belonging to different genetic groups and serological types. Immunoglobulins could not be detected in the mucin preparations, and addition of anti-human immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgG, or IgM serum to reaction mixtures did not affect binding. Mucin pretreated with periodate or iodoacetate no longer bound to S. mutans H12 cells, suggesting that carbohydrate moieties and sulfhydryl groups played an essential role. Active cell metabolism was not required for BGR mucin binding; however, pretreatment of H12 cells with periodate or heat (100 degrees C for 15 min) reduced binding. Mucin labeled with [(14)C]phenyl isothiocyanate appeared to bind to S. mutans H12 cells comparably to untreated mucin; the binding also appeared to be specific because less than 15% of the labeled material became bound when incubated with an excess of streptococci. Binding of [(14)C]phenyl isothiocyanate-labeled mucin was not affected by neutral sugars tested or by preparations of c antigen, glycerol teichoic acid, dextran, or crude glucosyltransferase. However, binding was inhibited by several amines. BGR salivary mucins are present in the acquired pellicle covering teeth; the ability of bacteria to selectively bind such components suggest that they may serve as receptor molecules involved in the attachment of bacteria to teeth.
TI  - Salivary agglutinin and secretory IgA reactions with oral streptococci.
AB  - S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. mitis and S. sanguis strains were isolated from three subjects of blood groups A, B and O. Parotid saliva samples obtained from the same subjects induced aggregation of some of the bacteria, the S. sanguis and the S. mutans strains in particular. While parotid saliva from the three subjects gave almost identical reactions, slight interindividual differences were observed for a few strains with the submandibular sublingual salivas. In parotid saliva, secretory antibodies reacting with all strains were present. The antibody levels differed between the three subjects but no specific pattern was observed when homologous strains were compared with heterologous strains.
TI  - Co-induction of beta-galactosidase and the lactose-P-enolpyruvate phosphotransferase system in Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The addition of lactose, galactose, or isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) to glucose-grown cells of Streptococcus salivarius 25975 resulted in the co-induction of both the lactose-P-enolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (lactose-PTS) and beta-galactosidase, with the latter the predominant metabolic system. With various strains of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis 10556, on the other hand, the lactose-PTS was the major metabolic pathway with beta-galactosidase induced either to low or negligible levels. In all cases, induction of the lactose-PTS resulted in the concomitant induction of 6-P-beta-galactosidase. The induction by lactose of both the lactose-PTS and beta-galactosidase in all strains was repressed by glucose and other catabolites, notably, fructose. Induction of beta-galactosidase in S. salivarius 25975 by IPTG was, however, relatively resistant to glucose repression. Induction experiments with IPTG and lactose suggested that a cellular metabolite of lactose metabolism was a repressor of enzyme activity. Exogenous cAMP was shown to reverse the transient repression by glucose of beta-galactosidase induction in cells of S. salivarius 25975 receiving lactose, provided the cells were grown with small amounts of toluene to overcome the permeability barrier to this nucleotide, cAMP, was however, unable to overcome the permanent repression of beta-galactosidase activity to a significant extent under these conditions.
TI  - Extractability of cell wall polysaccharide from lactobacilli and streptococci by  autoclaving and by dilue acid.
AB  - Autoclaving cell wall of Streptococcus mutans Ingbritt for 15 min under the Rantz and Randall conditions released one-tenth of the total cell wall carbohydrate, whereas two-thirds was extracted after autoclaving for 180 min. The extract contained the serotype c-specific antigen but lacked the lipoteichoic acid component extracted when whole cells were autoclaved. Autoclaving cell wall preparations from other strains of S. mutans and also Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus mitis in 0.85% NaCl for 180 min released the major proportion of the wall polysaccharide fraction. Approximately 50 to 90% of wall carbohydrate of Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus casei was released when cell wall preparations were autoclaved in 0.85% NaCl for 180 min. For wall preparations from several strains of S. mutans, autoclaving for 60 min at pH 3.75 released only 39 to 62% of wall carbohydrate, whereas almost total release could be achieved with the lactobacilli. Heating S. mutans Ingbritt cell wall for 24 h at 60 degrees C in 0.1 N H(2)SO(4) released only two-thirds of the wall carbohydrate; by comparison nearly all of the wall carbohydrate was released in 3 h from L. casei and L. fermentum. Autoclaving L. casei cell wall and purified soluble wall fractions hydrolyzed the phosphodiester bond between the polysaccharide and peptidoglycan. This was shown by the release of reactive N-acetylhexosamine in both cases and the presence of a phosphomonoester in the autoclaved soluble wall fractions. The results indicate that autoclaving can hydrolyze covalent linkages, and this must be considered when the Rantz and Randall procedure is used to obtain antigen preparations.
TI  - Factors affecting the aggregation of Actinomyces naeslundii during growth and in  washed cell suspensions.
AB  - Various factors affecting the aggregation of Actinomyces naeslundii strain 12104  were studied. When the pH of glucose-supplemented growth medium fell below 5.5, the cells aggregated and formed microbial masses which tenaciously adhered to the culture vessels. When the organism was cultured in the same medium in the absence of glucose, maximum growth was reduced and the final culture pH values remained above 6.5, but the cells were more dispersed and nonadherent. Adjusting the final pH of these cultures to below 5.5 with HCl caused the cells to aggregate. Cells from unsupplemented cultures with final pH values of 6.7 were washed by centrifugation, dispersed by vigorous shaking, and suspended in buffer at pH values ranging from 4.5 to 8.0. Aggregation (expressed as the percent reduction of optical density at 520 nm after incubation at 37 degrees C) occurred rapidly at pH values below 6.0 but did not readily occur at higher pH values. Aggregation of strain 12104 in washed cell suspensions was induced by low pH and influenced by cell concentration and ionic strength of the environment. Low pH values also induced aggregation in washed cell suspensions of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, and Actinomyces viscosus.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of extracellular products from oral bacteria on human fibroblasts and stimulated lymphocytes.
AB  - Extracellular products of 12 strains of Streptococcus mutans and 5 additional species of oral bacteria were analyzed for their ability to inhibit proliferation of fibroblastoid cells (HeLa and AV3) and blast transformation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from normal individuals. Products from S. mutans strains AHT and BHT, Streptococcus intermedius, and Actinomyces viscosus inhibited [3H]thymidine uptake by fibroblastoid cells and phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes. Products from S. mutans E49, Streptococcus salivarius, and Actinomyces naeslundii inhibited blast transformation of human lymphocytes but did not significantly inhibit the growth of fibroblastoid cells. Preparations from S. intermedius gave the greatest inhibitory activity against both target cell types; initial characterization of this preparation suggested a single factor active in both assays, in that the heat lability and Sephadex G-200 elution profile were similar for the inhibitory activity seen with the two cell types. The molecular weight of the inhibitor, estimated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 and Ultragel AcA34, was approximately 160,000. The results strongly suggest that oral bacteria produce heat-labile substances that interfere with fibroblast proliferation and alter the lymphocytic immunological response.
TI  - "Conjugal" transfer of plasmid DNA among oral streptococci.
AB  - The beta plasmid from Streptococcus faecalis strain DS5, which codes for resistance to erythromycin and lincomycin, was introduced into a Lancefield group F streptococcus, strain DR1501, by transformation. This strain, DR1501 (beta), was found to be an excellent donor of the beta plasmid and readily transferred the resistance markers to various lactic acid bacteria, including certain strains of S. mutans, S. sanguis, and S. salivarius. Evidence is presented indicating that the transfer of the beta plasmid is mediated by a mechanism that requires cell-to-cell contact. The transfer of plasmid DNA during conjugation has been confirmed by the isolation of beta plasmid from transconjugant clones and by their ability to then serve as donors of the erythromycin and lincomycin resistance markers.
TI  - Comparative estimates of bacterial affinities and adsorption sites on hydroxyapatite surfaces.
AB  - The adsorption of strains of prominent oral bacteria to hydroxyapatite (HA) surfaces was studied by use of an adsorption model based on the Langmuir adsorption isotherm; this permitted comparative estimates of the number of adsorption sites and the strength of the adsorption bonds on untreated and salivatreated HA surfaces for strain of Streptococcus mutans, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, and A. naeslundii. The experimental data closely followed the adsorption model as judged by the high correlation coefficients obtained for all strains studied. Adsorption to untreated HA was similar for strains of the six species studied, suggesting that a common adsorption mechanism, possibly Ca(2+) bridging, may exist for attachment to HA. More complex interactions appeared to be involved in bacterial adsorption to saliva-treated HA since adsorption of the strains tested at unsaturating cell concentrations varied more than 30-fold. This indicates that adsorbed salivary components on HA surfaces impart a higher order of specificity for subsequent bacterial adsorption. Fewer cells of strains of S. mutans, S. salivarius, and A. naeslundii adsorbed to saliva-treated HA than to untreated HA because adsorbed salivary components presented fewer adsorption sites. Substantially higher numbers of cells of strains of S. sanguis, S. mitis, and A. viscosus adsorbed to saliva-treated HA because the film of adsorbed salivary components increased the number of adsorption sites for these strains. The affinity constants for all but one strain studied were lower on saliva-treated HA than on untreated HA. The number of bacterial cells which adsorbed to saliva-treated HA more closely related to the number of available binding sites than to the strength of their adsorption bonds when tested at an initial concentration of 2 x 10(7) organisms/ml. Although some differences were observed in the adsorption of strains of S. mutans representative of five serological groups, the numbers which attached to saliva-treated HA did not vary widely; this suggests that factors other than their ability to attach to a pellicle-covered HA surface may be responsible for their varying geographic distribution in human populations.
TI  - Daucus carrota (carrot)--a selective bacteriosorbent.
AB  - 1) An extract of D. carrota induces agglutination of most serotypes of S. mutans  but not of S. salivarius or S. mitis. 2) If added to a suspension of mixed bacteria, a piece of D. carrota may selectively sorb S. mutans while S. salivarius and S. mitis only are affected to a minor degree. 3) A saliva coat on the bacteria may reduce the uptake of S. mutans to D. carota but does not totally prevent it.
TI  - Dental caries induction in experimental animals by clinical strains of Streptococcus mutans isolated from Japanese children.
AB  - Oral implantation and the cariogenic activity of clinical strains of Streptococcus mutans which had been isolated from Japanese children and labeled with streptomycin-resistance were examined in specific pathogen-free Sprague-Dawley rats. All the seven strains tested were easily implanted and persisted during the experimental period. Extensive carious lesions were produced in rats inoculated with clinical strains of S. mutans belonging to serotypes c, d, e, and f, and maintained on caries-inducing diet no. 2000. Noninfected rats did not develop dental caries when fed diet no. 2000. Type d S. mutans preferentially induced smooth surface caries in the rats. Strains of other serotypes primarily developed caries of pit and fissure origin. Caries also developed in rats inoculated with reference S. mutans strains BHTR and FAIR (type b) that had been maintained in the laboratories for many years. However, the cariogenicity of the laboratory strains was found to have decreased markedly. All three S. sanguis strains could be implanted, but only one strain induced definite fissure caries. Two S. salivarius strains could not be implanted well in the rats and therefore they were not cariogenic. Four different species of lactobacilli also failed to induce dental caries in rats subjected to similar caries test regimen on diet no. 200. S. mutans strain MT6R (type c) also induce caries in golden hamsters and ICR mice, but of variable degrees.
TI  - Some immunohistochemical experiments aiming at the electron-microscopic in situ identification of a dental plaque microorganism--Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The aim of the present investigation was to test a procedure useful for the electron-microscopic in situ identification of the presumptive cariogenic microorganism Streptococcus mutans (serotype d) growing in the human dental plaque. For this purpose, different parameters of an indirect immunohistochemical method were tested in three sets of experiments. In experiment set I, all serological and histochemical procedures were performed en bloc on specimens fixed only with glutaraldehyde before embedding in Vestopal W. Different marking substances, such as ferritin, alkaline phosphatase and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were tested. The en bloc method using HRP-labelled antibodies was found useful for staining of in vitro-grown bacteria but failed when applied to dental plaque. In experiment set II, ultrathin sections of glutaraldehyde-fixed and glycol methacrylate-embedded in vitro-grown bacteria were section-stained. The bacteria became outlined with a highly electron-dense HRP reaction product which accumulated on top of the cell envelope. The same type of HRP reaction product was found on some bacteria in the 2-day-old dental plaque after section-staining. This system was further tested in a series of controls also using consecutive serial sections. In exp. set III, a number of different stationary and transient oral bacteria were immunohistochemically section-stained. A cross-reaction with bacteria belonging to S.salivarius was discovered and removed by absorbing the anti-S.mutans serotype d serum with S.salivarius (NCTC 8618).
TI  - Genital occurrence of oral microbiota.
AB  - Recent studies indicate that tonsillar gonococcal infection or colonization is fairly common. Carriage rates of about 8% have been found. These studies also indicate that oro-genital contacts are common. Since very little is known about the amount of oral microbiota transmitted to the genitals, we have studied the occurrence of oral streptococci and Neisseria species in urethra and cervix. Among 128 patients attending an STD-clinic we found 10 carriers of oral streptococci, one Streptococcus mitior, four Streptococcus sanguis, one Streptococcus mutans and four Streptococcus salivarius and case of urethritis due to Neisseria menigitidis. Seventy-three of the patients had recently had their genitals exposed to the oral flora of their partners. Despite the heavy contamination with oral microbiota that can be assumed to occur in these cases, there seems to be no colonization of the genitals with oral microbiota.
TI  - Adherence of Veillonella species mediated by extracellular glucosyltransferase from Streptococcus salivarius.
AB  - The effect of extracellular products from Streptococcus salivarius on sucrose-dependent adherence to smooth surfaces by other oral bacteria was studied in vitro. Strains of Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Veillonella parvula without innate ability to adhere to a steel wire were able to do so when incubated with sucrose and cell-free culture fluid from S. salivarius strains 9759, 25975, CNII, and MEPI. These culture fluids synthesized more adherent material and water-insoluble glucan than those from Streptococcus mutans C67-1 and seven other S. salivarius strains. Among the S. salivarius strains, glucosyltransferase (GT; dextransucrase, EC 2.4.1.5) activity varied more than 100-fold. Cells of Veillonella and S. mitis S3 that had been incubated in culture fluids from S. salivarius 25975 and 9759, respectively, and then washed adhered upon subsequent incubation with sucrose. This was due to adsorbed GT because (i) the adherence was sensitive to dextranase; (ii) it was observed only with the high-GT culture fluids; (iii) it was dependent on sucrose; and (iv) the washed Veillonella cells synthesized glucan, but not fructan, from sucrose. These results suggest that sucrose-dependent adherence of bacteria without such innate ability can be mediated by (i) entrapment in insoluble glucan synthesized by S. salivarius culture fluids, and (ii) prior adsorption of GT from S. salivarius culture fluids. The possibility that GT formed by high-yield strains of S. salivarius is distributed through the mouth by the action of salivary flow and contributes to sucrose-dependent adherence and plaque formation is considered.
TI  - Binding of lectins to Streptococcus mutans cells and type-specific polysaccharides, and effect on adherence.
AB  - The lectin concanavalin A (Con A) agglutinated the cells of 13 of 15 strains of the seven serotypes of Streptococcus mutans in an 18-h incubation period. Strains of types a, d, f, and g agglutinated within 2 h. Strains of a, d, and f were also agglutinated in 2 h by the castor bean lectin RCA. S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. bovis, Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii, and Lactobacillus plantarum were agglutinated within 2 h. The S. mutans type f polysaccharide was precipitated by Con A. The a, b, c, d, and e polysaccharides were not precipitated. Glucan from d and e strains of S. mutans and dextran T2000 were also precipitated by Con A. D-glucose inhibited the agglutination of type f cells by Con A and the agglutination of type d cells by D-galactose. The quantity of [acetyl-3H]Con A bound was not proportional to the degree of agglutination. Cells grown in sucrose medium bound more Con A than those grown in glucose medium. After treatment with dextranase, the sucrose-grown cells bound two- to fourfold more Con A. The binding of Con A to the type-specific polysaccharide or to teichoic acid could not be determined by the use of specific antibody due to the binding of Con A to the antibody globulin on the cell surface. Con A bound to S. mutans cells did not inhibit the activity of cell-bound glucosyltransferase, glucan synthesis, and in vitro adherence. Bound Con A also did not inhibit the ability of heat-treated cells to bind glucosyltransferase, synthesize glucan, and produce in vitro adherence.
TI  - The effect of adsorption on the acid production of caries and noncaries-producing streptococci.
AB  - Eighteen different Streptococcus strains including S mutans, sanguis, mitis, salivarius, bovis, and 2F2, were assayed for their relative adsorption to synthetic hydroxyapatite and for quantities of lactic acid produced while in the adsorbed state. The results indicated that all S mutans and some S sanguis have an enhanced metabolic activity while adsorbed to hydroxapatite as compared to control suspensions without hydroxyapatite.
TI  - Survival of bacteria from human dental plaque under various transport conditions.
AB  - The effects of transport media, temperature, and anaerobiosis on the survival of  bacteria from human supragingival dental plaque were studied. Individual samples were obtained by passing sterile, unwaxed dental floss through the interproximal spaces. The plaque-bearing portion of floss was immediately placed in vials containing reduced transport fluid, viability-preserving microbistatic medium, or reduced salt solution transport fluid. Plaque samples were dispersed by ultrasonic oscillation, serially diluted, and plated in duplicate on MM10-sucrose-blood agar, mitis salivarius bacitracin agar, and Rogosa tomato juice agar. Initial viable counts (time 0) were compared with viable count determinations after 48- and 72-h storage. Quantitative recovery (>30%) of various groups of oral bacteria was accomplished from both reduced transport fluid and viability-preserving microbistatic medium after 48- and 72-h storage. Storage of dental plaque in reduced salt solution proved unsatisfactory for most bacteria (less than 10% survival). Since growth of some bacteria may occur in viability-preserving microbistatic medium and the charcoal present interferes with colonly enumeration on low-dilution plates, we found reduced transport fluid to be the most suitable medium for transport and recovery of bacteria from supragingival dental plaque. Subzero storage (-196 and -40 degrees C) did not enhance the survival of bacteria from dental plaque; storage at moderate (5 and 20 degrees C) temperatures gave better recovery of viable bacteria. Survival after anaerobic or aerobic storage was comparable for total colony-forming units; however, anaerobic storage enhanced survival of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus. Since these organisms are specifically associated with dental caries, anaerobic techniques are preferred for caries activity testing of plaque.
TI  - [Synthesis of extracellular polysaccharides by various forms of Streptococcus salivarius].
AB  - Streptococcus salivarius synthesizes extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) from saccharose under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Under aerobic conditions primarily soluble fructanes are formed. There are no differences between the EPS synthesized by r- and s-forms under aerobic conditions; anaerobically the s-forms produce more EPS and more fructane than the r-forms. As compared to streptococcus mutans, the streptococcus salivarius produces considerably more fructane and insoluble glucane under the conditions used.
TI  - Comparative recovery of Streptococcus mutans on ten isolation media.
AB  - The ability of Streptococcus mutans (Bratthall serotypes a through e) to grow on  10 isolation media was examined. The number and morphology of the colonies were observed to vary on different media. The use of blood-sucrose media consistently produced the highest recoveries. Mitis salivarius agar (MS) and higher recovery values than modified medium 10 (MM10SB), Trypticase-yeast extract-cystine medium (TYC), or MS with 1% tellurite (MST). MST with 40% sucrose (MS40S), MST with 20% sucrose and 0.2 U of bacitracin per ml (MSB), and Carlsson medium with 1% sulfasoxazole (MC), media formulated for the selection of S. mutans, were the most inhibitory for all serotypes. The morphology of several S. mutans strains was atypical on MC and MS40S, making positive identification difficult. Absence of growth of serotype a strains on MSB and serotype d strains on MC were the two major differences observed among the serotypes. Results are discussed in terms of the difficulties in making quantitative determinations from cultural data.
TI  - New method for the isolation of Streptococcus mutans and its differentiation from other oral streptococci.
AB  - A new, improved agar medium for the isolation of Streptococcus mutans, the etiological agent of dental caries, was developed. In contrast to mitis-salivarius agar, this medium not only recovers a greater number of S. mutans strains from most oral specimens but, because of its mannitol and sorbitol content, it also facilitates the differentiation of S. mutans from other oral streptococci, e.g., S. salivarius, S. mitis, and S. sanguis, which do not grow or produce scanty growth only after 10 days of incubation. The medium is easy to prepare because of its simple and unique composition, is characterized by the presence of an acid indicator, and can be utilized under aerobic and anaerobic conditions as well. The medium cannot be used to distinguish among the eight serotypes, a to g and SL-1, of S. mutans. Mannitol-utilizing bacteria such as streptococci (e.g., S. faecalis) and other microorganisms (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus) are able to grow on this medium and can be distinguished from S. mutans by their unique colony morphology.
TI  - Microbial characterization of an experimental cariogenic plaque in man.
AB  - Experimentally induced plaque seemed to originate by direct contact inoculation from the vestibular mucosa and saliva. During the next seven days, this plaque developed its own characteristics. Populations of Streptococcus mutans usually less than 2% of total streptococci population in plaques that were less than three days old, increased between days 3 and 7. Proportions of S sanguis, high in early samples, decreased after day 3. Populations of S salivarius, which usually outnumbered other streptococci, fluctuated widely through day 3, and then increased in proportion in subjects who were more productive of experimental caries, but decreased in subjects who were less productive. Proportions of plaque flora comprising lactobacilli paralleled those of S salivarius.
TI  - Transfection of Streptococcus sanguis by phage deoxyribonucleic acid isolated from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556 cells were infected with free phage DNA of S, mutans strain PK 1. Two transformants were isolated which made colonies with large mucoid forms on mitis-salivarius agar. Both transformants had an increased ability to synthesize insoluble glucan and showed an adhesive nature on glass surfaces. These characteristics of the transformants bear a resemblance to S. mutans. These transformants had many physiological characteristics by which they could be recognized as S. sanguis. However, they resembled S. salivarius in forming a large amount of soluble fructan. Furthermore, the transformant cells did not produce ammonia from arginine, whereas their parent cells did.
TI  - Competitive binding among oral strptococci to hydroxyapatite.
AB  - The relative affinity of various oral streptococci for hydroxyapatite (HA) differed widely. Streptococcus mutans affinity for dextran-coated HA was the highest of all the streptococci to any HA coating. S salivarius had the lowest affinity, and S sanguis affnity was higher then S miteor for saliva-coated HA. Competition for binding sites on saliva-dextran-coated, dextran-coated HA. Hhwever, competition between this pair was not for the same binding site but for closely associated sites.
TI  - Acid production from Lycasin, maltitol, sorbitol and xylitol by oral streptococci and lactobacilli.
AB  - The acid production from maltitol was compared with the acid production from hydrogenated starch hydrolysate (Lycasin), sorbitol and xylitol by a number of oral strains and reference strains of Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. mitior, S. milleri, S. faecalis, S. faecium, S. avium, Lactobacillus casei and L. salivarius. The polyols were added to a final concentration of 1.0% to two different basal media. Incubation was performed at 37 degrees C for 7 days after which the pH was recorded. Maltitol was fermented only by the lactobacilli (about two thirds of the strains). Lycasin was fermented by all strains of S. faecalis, more than 90% of the lactobacilli, about half of the S. sanguis strains, about one third of the S. mutans strains, and by a few other streptococcal strains. Acid production from sorbitol was observed among more than 80% of the S. mutans strains and the S. faecalis strains and most of the lactobacilli strains. Sorbitol-fermenting strains of S. sanguis and of S. mitior, all isolated from sorbitol-consumers, were observed. No other sorbitol-fermenting streptococci were found. Only the reference strains L. salivarius subsp. salivarius ATCC 11741 and S. avium ATCC 14025 fermented xylitol.
TI  - Determinants of the developing oral flora in normal newborns.
AB  - The ability of Streptococcus species to selectively adhere to the oral epithelial cells of newborns was studied in vitro. On day 1 of life, mucosal cells from normal infants demonstrated selective attraction for the natural distribution of streptococci that would soon colonize these surfaces. Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus mitis adhered well in vitro to scraped cells from cheek and tongue surfaces. Streptococcus mutans, on the other hand, exhibited feeble or no adherence to cheek or tongue cells. Adherence of Escherichia coli to oral epithelial cells was also studied. The ability of strains of E. coli to adhere to cheek and tongue cells correlated solely with the presence of cell surface substances, probably pili. These observations, made on infants at the critical moment of their developing flora, strengthen the hypothesis that the ability of bacteria to adhere to surfaces is an important determinant of their ecological place in the oral microflora.
TI  - Occurrence and distribution of sucrose-metabolizing enzymes in oral streptococci.
AB  - Specific growth rates, growth yields, and the level and cellular distribution of  three sucrose-metabolizing enzyme activities were determined for seven oral streptococci (Streptococcus mutans strains E49, BHT, 10449, SL-1, and LM-7, S. sanguis 10558, and S. salivarius 25975). Cultures were grown in a fermentor at pH 6 with either 20 mM glucose or 10 mM sucrose. Generation times varied between 21 and 70 min. Whereas some strains grew 10 to 50% more slowly with sucrose than with glucose, others did not. Growth was always logarithmic, and the growth yields were similar. Glcosyl transferase (EC 2.4.1.5) was largely extracellular; in sucrose cultures it was appreciably lower, but no major shift to a cell-associated form was found. In glucose cultures, the activity varied between 4 and 140 IU per 6-liter culture. The glucan formed was mostly or exclusively water insoluble. Glcosyl transferase was stimulated weakly (60% or less) by various dextrans. Fructosyl transferase (EC 2.4.1.10) was primarily extracellular (except in glucose cultures of S. salivarius) and varied between 0 and 337 IU/culture. In S. salivarius, the extracellular fructosyl transferase was induced by sucrose. In all S. Mutans cultures, the total fructosyl transferase activity was lower after growth with sucrose. All strains had extra- and intracellular invertase (EC 3.2.1.26) activity. Total levels varied between 210 and 3,500 IU/culture. Less extracellular activity was present in sucrose cultures. Only S. salivarius had appreciable activity in the cellular particulate fraction. Invertase activity was significantly higher than the combined glucosyl and fructosyl transferase activities in all cultures.
TI  - Growth of Streptococcus mutans on various selective media.
AB  - The ability of Streptococcus mutans to grow on mitis-salivarius (MS) agar, MC agar, mitis-sucrose-bacitracin (MSB), BCY agar, and MM10 sucrose agar was studied. Batch cultures of S. mutans serotype a demonstrated no growth on MSB agar. Certain serotype d and g strains did not grow on MC agar. The yield for most strains of other serotypes on these selective media was lower compared with that on MS agar. The number of total colony-forming units on BCY and MM10 sucrose agar was similar to the blood agar results. Similar data were obtained when fermenter-grown strains, harvested in the middle or the end of the logarithmic growth phase, were used for inoculation of the various media. Enumeration of S. mutans from plaque samples plated on MC and MSB agar yielded about 75% of the counts obtained on MS or the nonselective medium. When the proportions of S. mutans were expressed as a percentage of the total cultivable flora, the selective media (MC and MSB agar) showed approximately 10% lower values than the MS, BCY, and MM10 sucrose agar.
TI  - Differential recovery of Streptococcus mutans from various mitis-salivarius agar  preparations.
AB  - Recoveries of Streptococcus mutans from human dental plaque were lower when plated on mitis-salivarius agar obtained from Baltimore Biological Laboratories as compared with mitis-salivarius agar obtained from Difco Laboratories. However, no difference in recoveries of established laboratory strains of S. mutans was observed between these two agar preparations.
TI  - Arthritogenicity in rats of cell walls from several streptococci staphylococci and two other bacteria.
AB  - Bacterial cell walls from Str. bovis, Str. lactis, Str. mutans, Str. thermophilus, Str. salivarius, and Str. pyogenes were able to produce polyarthritis in rats but Str. faecalis cell walls were nonarthritogenic. S. aureus cell walls produced extremely severe disease. It was also shown that cell walls from S. epidermidis, B. megaterium, and M. lysodeikticus were nonarthritogenic. A close correlation was observed between development of arthritis and the delayed hypersensitivity to bacterial peptidoglycans but not with the PPD hypersensitivity. It was suggested that the adjuvanticity of bacterial cell walls is needed to induce the disease and that arthritogenicity requires a specific antigen in addition to the presence of an adjuvant-inducing agent.
TI  - [Difference between dental plaque formation by Lactobacillus Sp. and Strep. mutans].
AB  - Human teeth were suspended in a basal medium with sucrose 10%; they were incudated for formation of dental plaques "in vitro". The microorganisms used were: Strep. mutans, Lactobacillus salivarius var. salivarius and a mixture of them. The following aspects were stablishad by scanning electron microscopy: 1) The teeth inoculated with Strep. mutans had coccoid forms, lying on an organic film with spheric spaces in some sectors, and irreguar forms in others (Fig. 1). 2) The teeth inoculated with Lactobacillus salivarius had rod forms attached to the adamantine surface (Fig. 2, 3). 3) Teeth incubated with the mixutre had rod forms over a granular film (Fig. 4). 4) The control teath did not have plaque (Fig. 5). This experience shows that the extracellular polisacharide, reticulated or granular (mutano) appeared only in teeth incubated with Strep. mutans alone (Fig. 1) or mixed with Lactobacillus (Fig. 4). On the other hand Lactobacillus appeared attached on the enamel surfaces, perhaps due to cohesive adhesive forces (Fig. 2). Two different interpretation or the formation of dental plaques that take place on the enamel free surfaces of teeth are presented.
TI  - Comparative ultrastructure of selected oral streptococci: thin-sectioning and freeze-etching studies.
AB  - The ultrastructure of Streptococcus mutans, serotypes a-e, S. sanguis, S. mitis,  and S. salivarius HHT, were examined by the techniques of thin-sectioning and freeze-etching. The cell walls varied in width between 15 and 46 nm and were covered with an electron-dense fibrillar or fuzz layer. The cytoplasmic membrane was in close association with numerous mesosomes which were, in turn, either closely associated or in contact with the bacterial chromosome. In freeze-etch replicas, the outermost layer of the cell wall was fibrous, and the cytoplasmic membrane was covered with particles composed of several subunits. Both particle-clusters and particle-free areas occurred on the surfaces of the cytoplasmic membrane, as well as a crystalline array in the ground plasm of the cell.
TI  - Inhibition of Streptococcus mutans strains by different mitis-salivarius agar preparations.
AB  - Several Streptococcus mutans strains were markedly inhibited by mitis-salivarius  agar manufactured by Baltimore Biological Laboratories, but little, if any, inhibition was noted using Difco Laboratories' mitis-salivarius agar. Supplementation of the basic medium with sucrose and bacitracin for specific selection of S. mutans resulted in suppression of representative S. mutans type a strains regardless of manufacturer.
TI  - Dextran degrading bacteria in human oral cavity and their activity against insoluble glucan from Streptococcus mutants.
AB  - The distribution of dextran-degrading microorganisms in the saliva and plaque samples from the human oral cavity was assayed on 9 subjects. Approximately 2/3 of the saliva samples degraded Dextran T-150 (Pharmacia, M.W. 150,000) and 1/10 the Blue Dextran (Pharmacia), while 2/5 and 1/8 of the plaque samples degraded Dextran T-150 and Blue Dextran, respectively. Thirty-seven strains of the Blue Dextran degrading bacteria were isolated from the saliva and plaque samples and were classified into 6 groups by their morphology, gram staining and oxygen tolerance. The 24 strains from the 37 isolates, more or less, were shown to degrade the insoluble glucan extracted from Streptococcus mutans FA-1 on the agar plate. The 8 strains, selected from each group, were tested for their activity against the insoluble glucan extracted from Str. mutans (FA-1, HS-6, BHT, CHT, GS-5, LM-7 and PK-1) and Str. salivarius (HHT). The strains belonging to Groups I, II, IV and V showed activity against the insoluble glucan used. Among them, the strains of Group IV (gram negative facultative cocci) and Group V (gram negative strict anaerobic rod) were the most active against the insoluble glucan.
TI  - Properties of a mutant of Streptococcus mutans altered in glucosyltransferase activity.
AB  - A mutant of Streptococcus mutans GS-5 has been isolated as a smooth colonial variant on mitis salivarius agar. This mutant, designated SNG-1, adheres to glass surfaces as well as the parental organism when grown in the presence of sucrose. However, in contrast to the parental organism, glucose-grown cultures of the mutant did not adhere to smooth surfaces when incubated with sucrose under nongrowing conditions. The inability of the mutant organism to adhere to glass surfaces under the latter condition was a result to markedly reduced levels of mutant cell-associated glucosyltransferase activity. In addition, the extracellular activity of the mutant was also severely depressed relative to the parental activity. The reduced levels of mutant enzyme activity appear to be a result of a mutation in a structural gene coding for glucosyltransferase activity since (i) mutant glucosyltransferase activity is much less resistant to heat inactivation compared to the parental enzymes and (ii) the migration patterns of the mutant and parental enzymes differ on polyacrylamide gels and after isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide gels. However, the kinetic properties of the mutant enzymes are similar to those of the comparable parental activities in terms of pH and temperature optima and Km values for sucrose. The mutant enzyme responsible for soluble glucan synthesis has been purified approximately 300-fold. These results are discussed in terms of the mechanism of glucan synthesis by S. mutans.
TI  - Interspecies transformation of streptomycin resistance in oral streptococci.
AB  - Donor deoxyribonucleic acid extracted from streptomycin-resistant (Str(R)) mutant derivatives of a variety of strains of Streptococcus mutans, S. salivarius, and S. sanguis was used to transform streptomycin resistance into competent S. sanguis strain Challis. Transfer of genetic markers for sorbitol and mannitol fermentation and for extracellular polysaccharide as demonstrated by colonial morphology was not detected in this study. Reciprocal transformation between strain Challis and other oral streptococci could not be demonstrated. Transformation frequencies for Str(R) were relatively efficient among S. sanguis strains, with lower but significant frequencies demonstrated with strain Challis and donor deoxyribonucleic acid derived from other oral streptococci.
TI  - Cellular fatty acid composition of Streptococcus mutans and related streptococci.
AB  - The cellular fatty acid composition of 18 strains of Streptococcus mutans and 17  isolates of related streptococci were examined by gas-liquid chromatography. The cultures could be divided into two distinct groups on the basis of their fatty acids. The first group, which included S mutans and S salivarius, contained palmitic (16:0), octadecenoic (18:1), stearic (18:0), eicosenoic (20:1), and eicosanoic (20:0) acids. The presence of the two 20-carbon fatty acids distinguished S mutans and S salivarius from all of the other species. Two of the S mutans cultures were further distinguished by the presence of 19-carbon and 21-carbon cyclopropane acids. The second group included S sanguis, S mitis, S uberis, and a culture of Lancefield group C streptococci. The percentages of the major acids (16:0, 18:1, and 18:0) found in these species were essentially identical. A culture of Lancefield group E streptococci contained large amounts of 16:1 and 18:1 and small amounts of two unidentified acids which were not present in any of the other cultures.
TI  - Physiological classification of oral viridans streptococci.
AB  - The human mouth harbors large numbers of a variety of greening streptococci. For  many years the classification and nomenclature of these organisms have been confused, but recent studies have clarified the situation considerably. Five distinct species can be distinguished among the oral streptococci S mutans, S sanguis, S mitior, S milleri, and S salivarius, and these may be identified using a simple scheme consisting of seven physiological tests. Further subdivisions within these species may be achieved using serological methods. A small number of oral streptococci remain which cannot easily be identified with existing schemes. These may represent additional species that, as yet, have not been adequately described. There seems little justification for continuing the practive of calling all alpha-hemolytic streptococci simple "Streptococcus viridans".
TI  - Turku sugar studies X. Occurrence of polysaccharide-forming streptococci and ability of the mixed plaque microbiota to ferment various carbohydrates.
AB  - Dental plaque samples collected from the subjects during the last 20 months of the 2 year trial were subjected to quantitative and qualitative analysis of the occurrence of S. mutans, S. sanguis, S. salivarius and the total growth on phenol red agar. Lyophilized plaque samples were homogenized and incubated on a sucrose containing medium under anaerobic conditions. In addition, the pH-values were measured after incubation of the mixed plaque flora in media containing 1% respectively xylitol(X), sorbitol, sucrose (S), fructose (F) or no carbohydrates. The results show a significantly lower incidence of S. mutans in the X-group relative to the S- and F-groups. The corresponding difference could not be observed between the S- and F-groups. The logarithmic means and standard deviations of the colony counts of S. sanguis, S. salivarius and total bacteria yielded no significant differences between the 3 sugar groups during the test period. Repeated pH-measurements, carried out at the 4, 12, 18 and 24 month phases, showed that, except in the presence of X, the mean values all fell below the pH-limit of 5.5. In the course of the study, no evidence was obtained of adaption of mutation enabling acidogenic decomposition of X. These findings emphasize the importance of low acidogenic potential in dental plaque, generally paralleled by a low incidence of dental caries.
TI  - pH changes during culture of human dental plaque streptococci on mitis-salivarius agar.
AB  
TI  - Structural differences in fructans elaborated by streptococcus mutans and Strep.  salivarius.
AB  - D-Fructans synthesized from sucrose by cell-free systems of strains of Streptococcus mutans and Strep. salivarius have been shown by methylation and enzymatic studies to have different glycosidic linkages. The cold water-insoluble D-fructans from Strep. mutans strain BHT and JC-1 have inulin-type structures consisting beta-(2 leads to 1)-D-fructofuranosidic linkages, with average repeating units of 8 and 27 sugar residues, respectively, whereas the water-soluble fructan from Strep. salivarius strain HHT has a levan-type branched structure consisting beta-(2 leads to 6)-D-fructofuranosidic linkages with an average repeating unit of 9 sugar residues. The solubility properties of these fructants are discussed on the basis of the structural differences.
TI  - Glucose-6-phosphate-dependent pyruvate kinase in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Pyruvate kinase of Streptococcus mutans JC 2 had an absolute and specific requirement for glucose-6-phosphate. Inorganic phosphate was a strong inhibitor. The enzyme required K+ or NH4+ and Mg2+ or Mn2+. S. mutans FIL and E 49, Streptococcus bovis ATCC 9809, and Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419 had also glucose-6-phosphate-dependent pyruvate kinases, whereas Streptococcus sanguis NCTC 10904 had an enzyme activated by fructose-1,6-diphosphate.
TI  - Immunoadjuvant activities of cell walls and their water-soluble fractions prepared from various gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The cell walls from all 21 species of gram-positive bacteria examined, except lysozyme-susceptible Micrococcus lysodeikticus (NCTC 2665) and lysozyme-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 155), were found to be definitely adjuvant-active in both stimulation of increased serum antibody levels and induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity to ovalbumin when administered to guinea-pigs as water-in-oil emulsions. Using various cell wall lytic enzymes, the immunoadjuvant principles were solubilized with full retention of the adjuvant activities from walls of Staphylococcus aureus (Copenhagen), Streptococcus pyogens (group A, type 6; S43/100), Streptococcus salivarius (IFO 3350), Streptococcus faecalis (IFO 12580), Streptococcus mutans (BHT), Lactobacillus plantarum (ATCC 8014), Bacillus megaterium (IFO 12068), Corynebacterium diphtheriae (Park-Williams No. 8), Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Actinomyces viscous (ATCC 15987). Evidence was obtained that the non-peptidoglycan portion of the cell walls is not essential for manifestation of immunoadjuvancy.
TI  - Evaluation of human oral organisms and pathogenic Streptococcus for production of IgA protease.
AB  - IgA protease is a proteolytic enzyme found in whole human saliva and in dental plaque that cleaves both secretory and myeloma IgA of human origin to yield intact Fabalpha and Fcalpha fragments. To determine which bacteria are capable of producing this enzyme, we have examined a variety of strains normally found in the human oral cavity and a number of streptococci of known Lancefield group serotype. Streptococci of groups A, B, C, D, F, G, H, M, and N, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitior, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus faecalis, Veillonella, Lactobacillus, Actinomyces, Propionibacterium, Bacteroides, and Fusobacterium were grown in liquid medium, and fluids were examined for IgA protease activity. Only S. sanguis and clinically isolated group H streptococci elaborated IgA protease under the culture conditions used. Negative strains could not be stimulated to produce the enzyme when cultured in the presence of secretory IgA. Among the natural oral bacteria, capacity to produce IgA protease is restricted to certain species of Streptococcus, notably those of the group H serotype. Since secretory immunity is mediated by the IgA class of antibody, the presence of this enzyme at mucosal surfaces could modify the secretory immune function.
TI  - Amino acid requirements of Streptococcus mutans and other oral streptococci.
AB  - The amino acid requirements of Streptococcus mutans strains AHT, OMZ-61, FA-1, BHT, GS-5, JC-2, Ingbritt, At6T, OMZ-176, 6715, Streptococcus salivarius HHT, Streptococcus sanguis OMZ-9, and strain 72x46 were determined in a chemically defined medium. When grown anaerobically in the presence of sodium carbonate (or bicarbonate for a few strains), few amino acids were required. All strains tested required cystine (or cystine) as a nutrient. Three strains (S. mutans OMZ-176, FA-1, and BHT) required glutamate (and/or glutamine). A third amino acid (lysine for S. mutans FA-1 and histidine for S. mutans OMZ-176) was required by two of the three strains which required glutamate. The amino acids mentioned above were required for all conditions of incubation (and inoculum) tested. The requirements for several other amino acids were conditional, that is, dependent on the incubation conditions and inoculum used. For example, when carbonate was not added, glutamate was required by S. mutans GS-5. Aerobic incubations, with carbonate or bicarbonate added, resluted in requirements for glutamate and leucine by several strains. With these incubation conditions, one strain required isoleucine (S. mutans FA-1), another valine (S. mutans AHT), and a third tyrosine (72x46). Aerobic incubations in the absence of carbonate or bicarbonate further increased the number of amino acids required by several strains. Furthermore, when stationary-phase cultures replaced exponentially growing cultures as an inoculum, several strains required additional amino acids, presumably for the initiation of growth.
TI  - Growth of several cariogenic strains of oral streptococci in a chemically defined medium.
AB  - A chemically defined medium in which Streptococcus mutans strains AHT, BHT, GS-5, JC-2, Ingbritt, At6T, At9T, 6715, and OMZ-176 and Streptococcus salivarius strain HHT grew rapidly to high turbidities was formulated. Maximal turbidities of each strain were observed after 8 to 12 h of aerobic growth. The subsequent transfer of exponentially growing cells into fresh medium resulted in growth at the same rate without lag. Growth of these strains occurred with rates at least one-half of those observed in an organic medium, such as Todd-Hewitt broth. S. mutans strains FA-1 and OMZ-61 grew at relatively slow rates in the defined medium, but more rapidly growth to higher turbidities of both strains was obtained when sodium bicarbonate was added to the medium. Streptococcus sanguis strain OMZ-9 and another group H streptococcus (strain 72 times 46) grew rapidly in the defined medium after the addition of sodium carbonate. The presence of carbonate or bicarbonate yielded higher turbidities of all the other strains, and the growth rates of several of the strains tested were also increased.
TI  - Changing agglutination activities of salivary immunoglobulin A preparations against oral streptococci.
AB  - Immunoglobulin A (IgA) was prepared from samples of parotid saliva collected from two individuals over a 150-day period. Standardized solutions of the IgA were tested for agglutinating antibody activity against strains of streptococcus salivarius, S. sanguis, S. mitis, and S. mutans that had been isolated from a homologous individual on day 30 and preserved in the lyophilized state. The agglutinating activity of the standardized IgA preparations against these strains was found to change over time, whereas the agglutination patterns of IgA prepared from saliva samples collected 3 days apart were generally similar. Differences in agglutination titers were also observed between IgA samples prepared from saliva collected on day 0 and day 150. The data indicate that the oral cavity may harbor streptococci of different antigenic composition representing the same species at a given time and that parotid IgA agglutinating antibody against these serotypes changes over time.
TI  - Increased selectivity of Mitis-Salivarius agar containing polymyxin.
AB  - Incorporation of the antibiotic polymixin B sulfate in plates of Mitis-Salivarius medium at a level of 100 U per ml effectively suppressed the growth of gram-negative spreading organisms which occasionally overgrow Mitis-Salivarius plates of oral samples and make them unsuitable for enumeration and differentiation of streptococci. At the indicated level the antibiotic did not affect the growth or typical colonial characteristics of the oral streptococci.
TI  - Immunoelectron microscopic identification and localization of Streptococcus sanguis with peroxidase-labeled antibody: localization of surface antigens in pure cultures.
AB  - An indirect method of localizing antigens with horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody was used to identify and localize surface antigens of Streptococcus sanguis at the ultrastructural level. An electron dense layer surrounding the cell wall could be distinguished without any additional electron microscope staining. This labeled layer represents an immune complex consisting of bacterial surface antigens, specific rabbit antisera, and peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit globulins. Although with undiluted antisera slight cross-reactions occurred with S. salivarius and S. miteor (mitis), these could be readily distinguished from the more intense homologous reaction by their patchiness and the difference in distribution of the label. These cross-reactions were eliminated by appropriate dilutions of the antiserum. No cross-reactions occurred with S. mutans, S. faecalis, Actinomyces species, or Bacterionema, microorganisms wents indicated that horseradish peroxidase can become non-specifically adsorbed to the membrane of certain bacterial cells. Appropriate controls must, therefore, be included for localization of membrane associated antigens with horseradish peroxidase.
TI  - Characteristics of Streptococcus milleri and Streptococcus mitior from infected dental root canals.
AB  - Morphological and physiological characteristics of 103 streptococcal isolates obtained from positive routine cultures of material from dental root canals at filling, were studied. The majority of the isolates were those which at a primary identification not fullfilled the criteria of enterococci, Strep. sanguis, Strep. mutans or Strep. salivarius. Only a few representative strains of the latter types were included in the study as a control of the method. The resemblance of the 103 isolates to 38 reference strains were assessed with numerical methods. The isolates formed 9 clusters with reference strains occurring in all but one. Of the isolates which it was intended to identify and characterize with numerical taxonomic analysis, all but one joined one of 3 clusters and were identified as Strep. milleri or Strep. mitior (mitis). The most useful cultural characteristics to dfferentiate the two species were growth on the sulphonamide containing MC-agar and 7.5% bile blood agar by Strep. milleri and production of hydrogen peroxide by Strep. mitior. The characteristics of the strains in the nine 80-phenons are given in Table 2. Other characteristics that appeared to be of interest for differentiating Strep. milleri from Strep. mitior and these two species from other viridans streptococci are underlined in Table 2. Strep. milleri seems not earlier to have been reported to occur in infected root canals. The occurrence of Strep. milleri is in agreement with the data given on serological groups found among streptococcal isolates from routine root canal cultures. Little is known about the occurrence and distribution of Strep. milleri in the human oral cavity, which therefore warrant further investigations.
TI  - Bacteriocin production and susceptibility among strains of Streptococcus mutans grown in the presence of sucrose.
AB  - Whereas the bacteriocin activity of eight strains of Streptococcus mutans was unaffected by growth in the presence of sucrose, such a medium rendered five S. mutans and one S. salivarius indicator strains unsusceptible to the bacteriocins. In contrast, the susceptibility of three S. faecalis and one S. pyogenes strains was unaltered when these indicators were grown in the presence of sucrose. Since the S. mutans and S. salivarius strains produced extracellular polysaccharides from sucrose whereas the S. faecalis and S. pyogenes strains did not, it was concluded that a coating of extracellular polysaccharides rendered normally susceptible organisms unsusceptible to bacteriocin action. This supports previous suggestions that such bacteriocins are not active in vivo and therefore play no role in regulating the microbial ecology in dental plaque.

TI  - Mutanolysin, bacteriolytic agent for cariogenic Streptococci: partial purification and properties.
AB  - Mutanolysin partially purified from the culture filtrate of Streptomyces globisporus 1829 consists of two main lytic enzymes with an isoelectric point near pH 8.5 and 10, respectively, and proteolytic enzyme is associated with the latter lytic enzyme. Mutanolysin exhibited maximal lytic activity at 60 C in the pH range 6.5 to 7.0 and was stable at 50 C in the acid range. N-bromosuccinimide caused complete inhibition of lytic activity at 1 mM, whereas calcium and magnesium ions at the same concentration caused activation. Mutanolysin had lytic or bactericidal activity against the living cells of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Actinomyces viscosus, which are considered to be etiologic agents of dental caries, but had no activity against S. aureus and all gram-negative strains tested. The lytic activity was well retained in human saliva. Digestion of the cell walls of S. mutans BHT by mutanolysin was accompanied by the liberation of free amino groups and reducing sugars. Mutanolysin may be expected to be a useful agent for dental caries control.
TI  - In vitro attachment of streptococci to the tooth surface.
AB  - The ability of Streptococcus strains to adhere to the tooth surface in vitro was  investigated. Polished enamel slabs, with and without acquired pellicles, were incubated with buffer suspensions of oral streptococci, and attached bacteria were counted under a microscope using incident light. Low numbers of bacteria adhered to uncoated enamel; the presence of an acquired pellicle significantly enhanced the attachment of all strains tested. The adherence of Streptococcus sanguis was significantly greater than that of Streptococcus salivarius, and both of these strains adhered in greater numbers than did Streptococcus mutans. When bacteria were suspended in whole saliva, the adherence of S. salivarius and S. mutans was inhibited, whereas the adherence of S. sanguis was enhanced in some experiments and inhibited in others. The adherence of S. sanguis and S. salivarius was consistently inhibited by parotid fluid; this inhibitory effect persisted after thorough washing and resonication of the bacterial cells. Incubation in oral fluids was associated with the attachment of bacterial clumps to the pellicle, and parallel investigation revealed agglutination of S. sanguis and S. salivarius by whole saliva and, in particular, parotid fluid. The results are discussed in terms of surface microecology, and are related to the development of dental plaque.
TI  - Bacteremia after tooth extractions studied with the aid of prereduced anaerobically sterilized culture media.
AB  - Both prereduced molten agar and broth and aerobic molten agar and broth were inoculated with blood samples collected from patients with periodontitis, but in otherwise good health, both before and after extraction of two or more teeth. Postoperative blood samples from 23 of 25 patients sampled yielded anaerobic and facultative species. Colony counts from nine samples yielded from less than 1 to over 100 colonies per ml of blood. Organisms detected were species belonging to the genera Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Leptotrichia, Propionibacterium, Peptococcus, Veillonella, plus Streptococcus mitis, S. salivarius, vibrio forms, and strains resembling S. mutans. The data indicate that prereduced anaerobically sterilized culture medium with polyanethol sulfonate is effective for detecting anaerobic species in bacteremia and that anaerobic species can be prevalent in bacteremias immediately after tooth extraction in patients with periodontitis.
TI  - Efficiency of various growth media in recovering oral bacterial flora from human  dental plaque.
AB  - MM10 sucrose blood agar (MM10 SB agar), N(2)C agar, Schaedler agar (SH agar), and mitis salivarius agar (MS agar) were tested for their ability to recover human dental plaque flora by a continuous anaerobic procedure and by a conventional anaerobic method. MM10 SB agar yielded higher recovery of bacteria from plaque samples as determined by the enumeration of colony-forming units (CFU). The CFU on N(2)C agar, SH agar, and MS agar were lower than MM10 SB agar when the continuous anaerobic procedure was used. The superior performance of MM10 SB agar was much more apparent when used for the cultivation of dental plaque by the conventional anaerobic method. Under these conditions the counts were consistently higher on MM10 SB agar as compared to the other media tested. However, the differential counts of Streptococcus sanguis and S. mutans from carious plaque samples were in general comparable on all culture media. Deletion of blood from MM10 SB agar did not lower counts. The elimination of dithiothreitol from this medium resulted in a significantly lower recovery of bacteria from the plaque samples when cultured by the conventional anaerobic method. The storage of MM10 SB agar for varying periods of time aerobic conditions did not seem to affect its performance. These findings suggest that MM10 SB agar is an ideal culture medium for the isolation, nonselective enumeration, and differential counts of bacteria present in normal and disease-associated plaques.
TI  - Proportional distribution and relative adherence of Streptococcus miteor (mitis)  on various surfaces in the human oral cavity.
AB  - A group of streptococci possessing the characteristics of Streptococcus miteor (S. mitis) was found to predominate on nonkeratinized human oral mucosa. These organisms averaged from 76 to 89% of the total flora cultivable on anaerobically incubated blood agar plates from cheek, lip, and ventral tongue surfaces. They averaged 34, 40, and 18% of the streptococci in dental plaque, in saliva, and on the tongue dorsum, respectively. Their ability to adhere to oral surfaces was studied by introducing mixtures of streptomycin-resistant strains of S. miteor, S. salivarius, and S. mutans into the mouths of volunteers. Samples of oral surfaces taken 1 hr later indicated S. miteor adhered far better than the other streptococci to buccal mucosa and to teeth, but S. salivarius showed a higher affinity to the tongue dorsum. Glucose-grown cells of S. mutans adhered feebly to all oral surfaces studied and were rapidly cleared from the mouth. Cells of S. miteor and S. salivarius present naturally in saliva adhered to cleaned teeth comparable to in vitro cultivated strains. Electron microscopy of cells of S. miteor attached to buccal epithelial cells obtained from germfree rats indicated that the organisms possessed a fibrillar "fuzzy" coat which appeared to mediate their attachment to the epithelial cell membrane. This "fuzzy" coat was removed by treatment with trypsin, and it appears to be similar to that previously observed on cells of S. pyogenes and S. salivarius.
TI  - Use of specifically labeled sucrose for comparison of extracellular glucan and fructan metabolism by oral streptococci.
AB  - Sucrose labeled in the fructosyl ((3)H) and glucosyl ((14)C) moieties was used to quantitate extracellular polysaccharide production and degradation by cariogenic and noncariogenic oral streptococci. All of the strains produced glucan and fructan. Streptococcus salivarius produced primarily fructan, whereas S. mutans and S. sanguis produced more glucan than fructan. The cariogenic streptococci could degrade the fructan produced by noncariogenic strains. Although the soluble glucans from all of the strains were sensitive to dextranase, the insoluble glucan from S. mutans could be distinguished from the S. sanguis insoluble glucan by its greater resistance to this enzyme.

AB  
TI  - Selective bacterial adherence to oral epithelial surfaces and its role as an ecological determinant.
AB  - The possible relationship between the ability of Streptococcus species to adhere  to oral epithelial cells and their natural distribution on epithelial surfaces within the mouth was studied. Strains of S. salivarius and S. sanguis, which are present in significant proportions on oral epithelial surfaces, were found to possess a definite capacity to adhere to epithelial cells obtained from cheek scrapings of humans, hamsters, and germ-free rats. In contrast, strains of S. mutans, which are found in only minor proportions, if at all, on oral epithelial surfaces exhibited feeble or no adherence to oral epithelial cells. S. salivarius cells attached well to human cheek cells over the range of pH 5 to 8. Its adherence was not found to be markedly influenced by saliva or by growth in sucrose broth. Several other types of bacteria were examined which also exhibited widely different abilities to attach to human cheek cells. Mixtures of streptomycin-labeled strains were introduced into the mouths of volunteers for study of the adherence of Streptococcus species to oral epithelial surfaces in vivo. Labeled S. salivarius and S. sanguis were recovered in high proportions from cheek and tongue surfaces, whereas the proportions of labeled S. mutans recovered from these surfaces were low in comparison to the original mixture. These data indicate that a correlation exists between the relative adherence of various Streptococcus species and their proportional distribution found naturally on oral epithelial surfaces. The ability of bacteria to adhere to surfaces is proposed as a critical ecological determinant affecting their colonization in environments with open surfaces exposed to bathing fluids.
