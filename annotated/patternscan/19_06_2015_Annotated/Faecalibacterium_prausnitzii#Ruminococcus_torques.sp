TI  == identification and characterization of potential performance-related gut microbiotas in broiler chickens across various feeding trials.
AB  == three broiler feeding trials were investigated in order to identify gut bacteria  consistently linked with improvements in bird performance as measured by feed efficiency. trials were done in various geographic locations and varied in diet composition, broiler breed, and bird age. gut microbial communities were investigated using microbial profiling. eight common performance-linked operational taxonomic units (otus) were identified within both the ilea (180, 492, and 564-566) and ceca (140-142, 218-220, 284-286, 312, and 482) across trials. otu 564-566 was associated with lower performance, while otus 140-142, 482, and 492 were associated with improved performance. targeted cloning and sequencing of these eight otus revealed that they represented 26 bacterial species or phylotypes which clustered phylogenetically into seven groups related  to lactobacillus spp., ruminococcaceae, clostridiales, gammaproteobacteria, bacteroidales, clostridiales/lachnospiraceae, and unclassified bacteria/clostridia. where bacteria were identifiable to the phylum level, they belonged predominantly to the firmicutes, with bacteroidetes and proteobacteria also identified. some of the potential performance-related phylotypes showed high sequence identity with classified bacteria (lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus aviarius, lactobacillus crispatus, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, escherichia coli, gallibacterium anatis, clostridium lactatifermentans, ruminococcus torques, bacteroides vulgatus, and alistipes finegoldii). the 16s rrna gene sequence information generated will allow quantitative assays to be developed which will enable elucidations of which of these phylotypes are truly performance related. this information could be used to monitor strategies to improve feed efficiency and feed formulation for optimal gut health.

TI  == dysbiosis of the faecal microbiota in patients with crohn's disease and their unaffected relatives.
AB  == background and aims: a general dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota has been established in patients with crohn's disease (cd), but a systematic characterisation of this dysbiosis is lacking. therefore the composition of the predominant faecal microbiota of patients with cd was studied in comparison with  the predominant composition in unaffected controls. whether dysbiosis is present  in relatives of patients cd was also examined. methods: focusing on families with at least three members affected with cd, faecal samples of 68 patients with cd, 84 of their unaffected relatives and 55 matched controls were subjected to community fingerprinting of the predominant microbiota using denaturing gradient  gel electrophoresis (dgge). to analyse the dgge profiles, bionumerics software and non-parametric statistical analyses (spss v.17.0) were used. observed differences in the predominant microbiota were subsequently confirmed and quantified with real-time pcr. results: five bacterial species characterised dysbiosis in cd, namely a decrease in dialister invisus (p=0.04), an uncharacterised species of clostridium cluster xiva (p = 0.03), faecalibacterium  prausnitzii (p < 1.3 x 10(-)(5)) and bifidobacterium adolescentis (p = 5.4 x 10(-)(6)), and an increase in ruminococcus gnavus (p = 2.1 x 10(-)(7)). unaffected relatives of patients with cd had less collinsella aerofaciens (p = 0.004) and a member of the escherichia coli-shigella group (p = 0.01) and more ruminococcus torques (p = 0.02) in their predominant microbiota as compared with  healthy subjects. conclusion: unaffected relatives of patients with cd have a different composition of their microbiota compared with healthy controls. this dysbiosis is not characterised by lack of butyrate producing-bacteria as observed in cd but suggests a role for microorganisms with mucin degradation capacity.
