TI  == alcohol and tobacco consumption affects bacterial richness in oral cavity mucosa  biofilms.
AB  == background: today there are more than 2 billion alcohol users and about 1.3 billion tobacco users worldwide. the chronic and heavy use of these two substances is at the heart of numerous diseases and may wreak havoc on the human  oral microbiome. this study delves into the changes that alcohol and tobacco may  cause on biofilms of the human oral microbiome. to do so, we used swabs to sample the oral biofilm of 22 subjects; including 9 control-individuals with no or very  low consumption of alcohol and no consumption of tobacco, 7 who were chronic and  heavy users of both substances and 6 active smokers that reported no significant  alcohol consumption. dna was extracted from swabs and the v1 region of the 16s rrna gene was pcr amplified and sequenced using the ion torrent pgm platform, generating 3.7 million high quality reads. dna sequences were clustered and otus  were assigned using the arb silva database and qiime. results: we found no differences in species diversity and evenness among the groups. however, we found a significant decrease in species richness in only smokers and in smokers/drinkers when compared to controls. we found that neisseria abundance was significantly decreased in both groups when compared to controls. smokers had significant increases in prevotella and capnocytophaga and reductions in granulicatella, staphylococcus, peptostreptococcus and gemella when compared to the two other groups. controls showed higher abundance of aggregibacter, whilst smokers/drinkers had lower abundances of fusobacteria. samples from only smokers  clustered closer together than to controls and smokers/drinkers, and also had a significant reduction in inter-group dissimilarity distances, indicating a more homogenous group than controls. conclusions: our results indicate that the continued use of tobacco or alcohol plus tobacco significantly reduces bacterial  richness, which apparently leads to a reduction in inter-group variability, turning the respective biofilms into a more homogenous microenvironment in terms  of bacterial community composition, with possible consequences for human oral diseases.

TI  == accurate identification of fastidious gram-negative rods: integration of both conventional phenotypic methods and 16s rrna gene analysis.
AB  == background: accurate identification of fastidious gram-negative rods (gnr) by conventional phenotypic characteristics is a challenge for diagnostic microbiology. the aim of this study was to evaluate the use of molecular methods, e.g., 16s rrna gene sequence analysis for identification of fastidious gnr in the clinical microbiology laboratory. results: a total of 158 clinical isolates covering 20 genera and 50 species isolated from 1993 to 2010 were analyzed by comparing biochemical and 16s rrna gene sequence analysis based identification. 16s rrna gene homology analysis identified 148/158 (94%) of the isolates to species level, 9/158 (5%) to genus and 1/158 (1%) to family level. compared to 16s rrna gene sequencing as reference method, phenotypic identification correctly identified 64/158 (40%) isolates to species level, mainly aggregatibacter aphrophilus, cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens, pasteurella multocida, and 21/158 (13%) isolates correctly to genus level, notably capnocytophaga sp.; 73/158 (47%) of the isolates were not identified or misidentified. conclusions: we herein propose an efficient strategy for accurate identification of fastidious gnr in the clinical microbiology laboratory by integrating both conventional phenotypic methods and 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. we conclude that 16s rrna gene sequencing is an effective means for identification of fastidious gnr, which are not readily identified by conventional phenotypic methods.

TI  == the cultivable human oral gluten-degrading microbiome and its potential implications in coeliac disease and gluten sensitivity.
AB  == coeliac disease is characterized by intestinal inflammation caused by gluten, proteins which are widely contained in the western diet. mammalian digestive enzymes are only partly capable of cleaving gluten, and fragments remain that induce toxic responses in patients with coeliac disease. we found that the oral microbiome is a novel and rich source of gluten-degrading organisms. here we report on the isolation and characterization of the cultivable resident oral microbes that are capable of cleaving gluten, with special emphasis on the immunogenic domains. bacteria were obtained by a selective culturing approach and enzyme activities were characterized by: (i) hydrolysis of paranitroanilide-derivatized gliadin-derived tripeptide substrates; (ii) gliadin  degradation in-gel (gliadin zymography); (iii) gliadin degradation in solution; (iv) proteolysis of the highly immunogenic alpha-gliadin-derived 33-mer peptide.  for selected strains ph activity profiles were determined. the culturing strategy yielded 87 aerobic and 63 anaerobic strains. species with activity in at least two of the four assays were typed as: rothia mucilaginosa hot-681, rothia aeria hot-188, actinomyces odontolyticus hot-701, streptococcus mitis hot-677, streptococcus sp. hot-071, neisseria mucosa hot-682 and capnocytophaga sputigena  hot-775, with rothia species being active in all four assays. cleavage specificities and substrate preferences differed among the strains identified. the approximate molecular weights of the enzymes were ~75 kd (rothia spp.), ~60 kd (a. odontolyticus) and ~150 kd (streptococcus spp.). in conclusion, this study identified new gluten-degrading microorganisms in the upper gastrointestinal tract. a cocktail of the most active oral bacteria, or their isolated enzymes, may offer promising new treatment modalities for coeliac disease.

TI  == microbiological characterization in children with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == the objective of this study was to characterize the subgingival microbiota of african-american children with localized aggressive periodontitis (lap). fifty-one children were included. subgingival plaque samples were taken from diseased (dd) and healthy sites (dh) in lap and from healthy sites in hs and hc and analyzed by 16s rrna-based microarrays. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) was the only species found to be both more prevalent (or = 8.3, p = 0.0025)  and abundant (p < 0.01) in dd. filifactor alocis (fa) was also found to be more prevalent in dd (or 2.31, ci 1.06-5.01, p = 0.03). most prevalent species in healthy sites were selenomonas spp, veillonella spp, streptococcus spp, bergeyella sp, and kingella oralis. overall, streptococcus spp, campylobacter gracilis, capnocytophaga granulosa, haemophilus parainfluenzae, and lautropia mirabilis were most abundant in healthy children, while aa, fa, tannerella sp, solobacterium moorei, parvimonas micra, and capnocytophaga sp were most abundant  in lap. based on a comprehensive analysis with 16s rrna-based microarrays, aa was strongly associated and site-specific in lap. in contrast, other species were found to be associated with healthy sites and individuals (clinicaltrials.gov number ct01330719). abbreviations: healthy site in healthy sibling (hs); healthy  site in healthy control child (hc).

TI  == impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n  = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after  treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in  rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203,  pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia  dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated  with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI  == imtechella halotolerans gen. nov., sp. nov., a member of the family flavobacteriaceae isolated from estuarine water.
AB  == a novel gram-negative, rod-shaped, non-motile, non-sporulating bacterium, designated strain k1(t), was isolated from an estuarine water sample collected from kochi, kerala, india. colonies on marine agar were circular, 2.0-2.5 mm in diameter, shiny, yellow, translucent and convex with entire margins. strain k1(t) was negative for ornithine decarboxylase, lysine decarboxylase, nitrate reduction and h(2)s production. the fatty acids were dominated by iso-branched components with a high abundance of iso-c(15:0), iso-c(15:1) g and iso-c(17:0) 3-oh; mk-6 (64%) and mk-7 (34%) were found as major respiratory quinones; and phosphatidylethanolamine, two unidentified aminolipids, four unidentified phospholipids and two unidentified lipids were major polar lipids. the dna g+c content of strain k1(t) was 46.1 mol%. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis indicated  that strain k1(t) was related most closely to the type strain of zhouia amylolytica (pairwise sequence similarity of 93.0%). phylogenetic analysis showed that strain k1(t) formed a distinct branch within the family flavobacteriaceae and clustered with the clade comprising species of the genera zhouia, coenonia and capnocytophaga, being phylogenetically most closely related to the type strain of zhouia amylolytica at a distance of 9.2% (90.8% similarity). other species of the genera within the same clade were related to strain k1(t) at distances of 15.0-23.1%. based on phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics and on phylogenetic inference, strain k1(t) is considered to represent a novel species of a new genus in the family flavobacteriaceae, for which the name imtechella halotolerans gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain of imtechella halotolerans is k1(t) (=mtcc 11055(t)=jcm 17677(t)).

TI  == bacterial leakage along the implant-abutment interface: culture and dna checkerboard hybridization analyses.
AB  == objective: bacterial species have been found harboring the internal surface of dental implants as consequence of their failed connections. the aim of the present study was to compare the detection frequency of bacterial leakage from human saliva through the implant-abutment interface, under non-loading conditions, using either dna checkerboard or culture method. materials and methods: thirty dental implants with hexagonal platforms were connected to pre-machined abutments according to the manufacturers' specifications. the assemblies were individually incubated in human saliva under anaerobic conditions for 7 days at 37 degrees c. afterward, contents from the inner parts of the implants were collected and evaluated with either dna checkerboard (s = 15) or culture (n = 15). subsequently, identification and quantitation of bacterial species from saliva and implants were carried out for the group evaluated with the dna checkerboard method. results: both dna checkerboard and culture showed positive signals of bacterial leakage in 6 of the 15 evaluated samples. capnocytophaga gingivalis and streptococcus mutans were the most frequently detected species harboring the internal surface of the implants followed by veillonella parvula. conclusion: occurrence of bacterial leakage along the implant-abutment interface is comparably detected with both dna checkerboard hybridization and conventional culture methods.

TI  == clonal analysis of the microbiota of severe early childhood caries.
AB  == background/aims: severe early childhood caries is a microbial infection that severely compromises the dentition of young children. the aim of this study was to characterize the microbiota of severe early childhood caries. methods: dental  plaque samples from 2- to 6-year-old children were analyzed using 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing, and by specific pcr amplification for streptococcus mutans and bifidobacteriaceae species. results: children with severe caries (n =  39) had more dental plaque and gingival inflammation than caries-free children (n = 41). analysis of phylotypes from operational taxonomic unit analysis of 16s rrna clonal metalibraries from severe caries and caries-free children indicated that while libraries differed significantly (p < 0.0001), there was increased diversity than detected in this clonal analysis. using the human oral microbiome  database, 139 different taxa were identified. within the limits of this study, caries-associated taxa included granulicatella elegans (p < 0.01) and veillonella sp. hot-780 (p < 0.01). the species associated with caries-free children included capnocytophaga gingivalis (p < 0.01), abiotrophia defectiva (p < 0.01), lachnospiraceae sp. hot-100 (p < 0.05), streptococcus sanguinis (p < 0.05) and streptococcus cristatus (p < 0.05). by specific pcr, s. mutans (p < 0.005) and bifidobacteriaceae spp. (p < 0.0001) were significantly associated with severe caries. conclusion: clonal analysis of 80 children identified a diverse microbiota that differed between severe caries and caries-free children, but the  association of s. mutans with caries was from specific pcr analysis, not from clonal analysis, of samples.

TI  == bacterial 16s sequence analysis of severe caries in young permanent teeth.
AB  == previous studies have confirmed the association of the acid producers streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp. with childhood caries, but they also  suggested these microorganisms are not sufficient to explain all cases of caries. in addition, health-associated bacterial community profiles are not well understood, including the importance of base production and acid catabolism in ph homeostasis. the bacterial community composition in health and in severe caries of the young permanent dentition was compared using sanger sequencing of the ribosomal 16s rrna genes. lactobacillus species were dominant in severe caries, and levels rose significantly as caries progressed from initial to deep lesions.  s. mutans was often observed at high levels in the early stages of caries but also in some healthy subjects and was not statistically significantly associated  with caries progression in the overall model. lactobacillus or s. mutans was found either at low levels or not present in several samples. other potential acid producers observed at high levels in these subjects included strains of selenomonas, neisseria, and streptococcus mitis. propionibacterium fma5 was significantly associated with caries progression but was not found at high levels. an overall loss of community diversity occurred as caries progressed, and species that significantly decreased included the streptococcus mitis-s. pneumoniae-s. infantis group, corynebacterium matruchotii, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, capnocytophaga gingivalis, eubacterium ir009,  campylobacter rectus, and lachnospiraceae sp. c1. the relationship of acid-base metabolism to 16s rrna gene-based species assignments appears to be complex, and  metagenomic approaches that would allow functional profiling of entire genomes will be helpful in elucidating the microbial pathogenesis of caries.

TI  == subgingival microbial profiles of smokers with periodontitis.
AB  == the subgingival microbiome is largely uncultivated, and therefore, cultivation-based and targeted molecular approaches have limited value in examining the effect of smoking on this community. we tested the hypothesis that  the subgingival biofilm is compositionally different in current and never-smokers by using an open-ended molecular approach for bacterial identification. subgingival plaque from deep sites of current and never-smokers matched for disease was analyzed by 16s sequencing. smokers demonstrated greater abundance of parvimonas, fusobacterium, campylobacter, bacteroides, and treponema and lower levels of veillonella, neisseria, and streptococcus. several uncultivated peptostreptococci, parvimonas micra, campylobacter gracilis, treponema socranskii, dialister pneumosintes, and tannerella forsythia were elevated in this group, while veillonella sp. oral clone b2, neisseria sp. oral clone 2.24, streptococcus sanguinis, and capnocytophaga sp. clone ah015 were at lower levels. the microbial profile of smoking-associated periodontitis is distinct from that of non-smokers, with significant differences in the prevalence and abundance of disease-associated and health-compatible organisms.

TI  == [usefulness and limit of gram staining smear examination].
AB  == gram staining is one of the most simple and inexpensive methods for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infections. it yields results much faster than  culture, and provides important data for the patient's treatment and prognosis. however, a difference exists in the quality and quantity of information yielded by gram staining smears based on the experience and knowledge of those conducting the tests. therefore, a risk of misdiagnosis based on the information obtained from gram staining smears is also present. the gram staining conditions and morphology of bacteria sometimes change due to antimicrobial therapy. species of  gram-negative rods sometimes become filamentous and pleomorphic. gram-positive bacteria may become gram variable (change in staining condition) after antimicrobial therapy. even bacteria that are easy to mis-identify exist, because the morphology of bacteria may be similar. enterococcus faecalis is a gram-positive diplococcus, forming gram-positive clustered cocci in specimens from blood culture bottles, resembling streptococcus pneumoniae. acinetobacter baumannii is a gram-negative diplococcus in sputum, resembling moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis. pasteurella multocida is a small-sized, gram-negative  short rod in the sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. prevotella intermedia is a small-sized, gram-negative short rod in sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. capnocytophaga sp. is a gram-negative fusiform (thin needle shape) rod present in clinical specimens, resembling fusobacterium nucleatum.

TI  == mechanical non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis: a single-blinded randomized longitudinal clinical study. ii. microbiological results.
AB  == background: peri-implantitis is common in patients with dental implants. we performed a single-blinded longitudinal randomized study to assess the effects of mechanical debridement on the peri-implant microbiota in peri-implantitis lesions. materials and methods: an expanded checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assay encompassing 79 different microorganisms was used to study bacterial counts before and during 6 months following mechanical treatment of peri-implantitis in  17 cases treated with curettes and 14 cases treated with an ultrasonic device. statistics included non-parametric tests and glm multivariate analysis with p<0001 indicating significance and 80% power. results: at selected implant test sites, the most prevalent bacteria were: fusobacterium nucleatum sp., staphylococci sp., aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, helicobacter pylori, and tannerella forsythia. 30 min. after treatment with curettes, a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotype a), lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus anginosus, and veillonella parvula were found at lower counts (p<0.001). no such  differences were found for implants treated with the ultrasonic device. inconsistent changes occurred following the first week. no microbiological differences between baseline and 6-month samples were found for any species or between treatment study methods in peri-implantitis. conclusions: both methods failed to eliminate or reduce bacterial counts in peri-implantitis. no group differences were found in the ability to reduce the microbiota in peri-implantitis.

TI  == detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria in pregnant women by traditional anaerobic culture method and by a commercial molecular genetic method.
AB  == to culture facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria is a well-established method for analyzing subgingival plaque samples. micro-ident and micro-ident plus (hain  lifescience gmbh, nehren, germany) tests are two commercially available rapid pcr-based methods for the identification and quantification of putative periodontopathogen bacteria. in this study, we compared these commercial pcr-based hybridization methods with conventional anaerobic culture technique. a  total of 36 subgingival plaque samples were collected from periodontal pockets of pregnant women with chronic localized periodontitis. aliquots of these samples were evaluated with species-specific probes provided by micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests simultaneously, and from the same samples anaerobic and capnophylic bacteria were cultured on selective media. the overall agreement between both methods was excellent for eubacterium nodatum, tannerella forsythia  and porphyromonas gingivalis (97-92%), fair for capnocytophaga sp, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia (91-89%) and poor for fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra (micromonas micros), and campylobacter rectus (86-78%). discrepancies in the results may be explained by inability of culture method to distinguish between closely related taxa (e.i p. intermedia/prevotella. nigrescens), and problems of keeping periodontopathogen bacteria viable, which is required for successful detection by standard culture method. nucleic acid-based methods may replace cultivation method as frequently used methods in microbiological diagnosis of progressive periodontitis, thus micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests can be recommended where culture of periodontopathogenic bacteria is not performed in routine microbiology laboratories to analyze subgingival plaque samples.

AB  == background: the bacterial colonization of the oral mucosa was evaluated in patients with asymptomatic oral lichen planus (olp) and compared to the microbiologic status in mucosally healthy subjects. methods: bacteria from patients with clinically and histopathologically diagnosed olp from the stomatology service, department of oral surgery and stomatology, school of dental medicine, university of bern, were collected with a non-invasive swab system. samples were taken from olp lesions on the gingiva and from non-affected sites on the contralateral side of the mouth. the control population did not have olp and  was recruited from the student clinic. all samples were processed with the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using well-defined bacterial species for the analysis. results: significantly higher bacterial counts of bacteroides ureolyticus (p = 0.001), dialister species (sp.) (p = 0.006), staphylococcus haemolyticus (p = 0.007), and streptococcus agalactiae (p = 0.006) were found in  samples taken from olp lesions compared to sites with no clinical evidence of olp. significantly higher bacterial counts were found for capnocytophaga sputigena, eikenella corrodens, lactobacillus crispatus, mobiluncus curtisii, neisseria mucosa, prevotella bivia, prevotella intermedia, and s. agalactiae at sites with lesions in subjects with olp compared to sites in control subjects (p  <0.001). conclusions: microbiologic differences were found between sites with olp and sites in subjects without a diagnosis of olp. specifically, higher counts of  staphylococci and s. agalactiae were found in olp lesions.

TI  == diversity of capnocytophaga species in children and description of capnocytophaga leadbetteri sp. nov. and capnocytophaga genospecies ahn8471.
AB  == bacteria of the genus capnocytophaga form part of the resident oral flora in children and adults. they are recognized as opportunistic pathogens of various extra-oral infections. the significance of individual species in periodontal and  extra-oral diseases is unclear, due to the inability of conventional phenotypic tests to identify clinical isolates to species level. aiming at a clear distinction between species, we undertook a phylogenetic study of a collection of 102 capnocytophaga strains including 62 oral isolates from children and 40 reference strains from oral and extra-oral infections representing the five known, human, oral capnocytophaga species. the phylogeny was estimated on the basis of multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (mlee) of 12 intracellular, housekeeping enzymes and by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing, and was compared to phenotypic characteristics. the clustering profiles in the mlee and sequence-based dendrograms were concordant and allowed identification of isolates to species level, based on co-clustering with reference strains. the study confirmed capnocytophaga ochracea and capnocytophaga sputigena as separate species, and underlined the problems of distinguishing between them by conventional phenotypic tests. the presence of two distinct clusters of oral isolates from children indicated the existence of novel species, supported by analysis of near-full-length 16s rrna gene sequences and by dna-dna hybridization results. one cluster of weakly saccharolytic isolates without the ability to ferment sucrose is proposed as capnocytophaga leadbetteri sp. nov. (type strain ahn8855(t)=ccug 51857(t)=nctc 13375(t)). another cluster not phenotypically distinguishable from c. ochracea and c. sputigena is designated capnocytophaga genospecies ahn8471 (represented by strain ahn8471=ccug 51856=nctc 13374).

TI  == bacterial species in subgingival plaque and oral bone loss in postmenopausal women.
AB  == background: oral bacteria are widely recognized in the etiology of periodontal disease. we investigated the prevalence of subgingival bacterial infection with eight species, tested associations between infection and oral bone loss, and assessed potential confounding factors and effect modifiers of those associations in a large community-based cohort of postmenopausal women. methods: a cross-sectional study of oral health and osteoporosis in 1,256 postmenopausal women recruited from the buffalo, new york women's health initiative observational study was conducted. standardized dental radiographs were used to measure alveolar crestal height (ach). subgingival plaque samples were taken, and the presence of eight bacterial species was assessed by indirect immunofluorescent microscopy in each participant. results: the most prevalent infection was streptococcus sanguis (59.5%), followed by prevotella intermedia (43.4%), tannerella forsythensis (37.9%), capnocytophaga sp. (36.9%), eubacterium saburreum (32.7%), campylobacter rectus (17.4%), porphyromonas gingivalis (15.1%), and fusobacterium nucleatum (14.2%). infections with p. gingivalis, t. forsythensis, p. intermedia, and c. rectus were associated with an increased likelihood of having oral bone loss as measured by ach, even after adjustment for age, smoking, and income. the body mass index (bmi) was a modifier of this association. overweight women with t. forsythensis infection were more likely to  have oral bone loss (or = 3.37; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 2.08 to 5.46) than  normal weight (or = 1.27; 95% ci: 0.82 to 1.98) or obese (or = 1.26, 95% ci: 0.72 to 2.20) women with t. forsythensis infection. conclusions: the prevalence of specific bacterial infections was determined for a large group of postmenopausal  women. those with infection were more likely to have oral bone loss. further studies should investigate potential modifying effects of bmi and/or inflammatory factors.

TI  == effect of an essential oil-containing antimicrobial mouthrinse on specific plaque bacteria in vivo.
AB  == aim: this study was conducted to investigate the effect of rinsing with an essential oil-containing mouthrinse on levels of specific supra and subgingival bacteria in subjects with gingivitis. material and methods: fifteen subjects meeting entry criteria completed this randomized, controlled, double-blind, crossover study. subjects were required to have >or=1000 target organisms per millilitre in pooled samples from two subgingival sites. following sampling of supra and subgingival plaque, subjects began twice-daily rinsing for 14 days with either an essential oil-containing mouthrinse (cool mint listerine antiseptic) or a negative control. supra and subgingival plaque was again sampled on day 15, and the procedure repeated after a 1-week washout period with subjects using the alternate rinse. results: compared with the negative control, the essential oil mouthrinse produced significant reductions in supragingival plaque levels of veillonella sp., capnocytophaga sp., fusobacterium nucleatum, and total anaerobes ranging from 52.3 to 88.5% (p<0.001 except for veillonella, p=0.002); respective  reductions in subgingival plaque ranged from 54.1 to 69.1% (p<0.001). conclusions: rinsing with the essential oil mouthrinse can have an impact on the  subgingival plaque flora. this study provides additional evidence indicating that reduction in supragingival plaque can reduce levels of subgingival plaque.

TI  == infection at titanium implants with or without a clinical diagnosis of inflammation.
AB  == objectives: to assess the microbiota at implants diagnosed with peri-implantitis, implant mucositis, or being clinically healthy. material and methods: clinical and microbiological data were collected from 213 subjects (mean age: 65.7+/-14) with 976 implants in function (mean: 10.8 years, sd+/-1.5). forty species were identified by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: implant mean % plaque score was 41.8+/-32.4%. periodontitis defined by bone loss was found in 44.9% of subjects. implant mucositis was diagnosed in 59% and peri-implantitis in 14.9% of all cases. neisseria mucosa, fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum, f. nucleatum sp. polymorphum, and capnocytophaga sputigena dominated the implant sub-mucosal microbiota and the sub-gingival microbiota at tooth sites. implant probing pocket depth at the implant site with the deepest probing depth was correlated with levels of eikenella corrodens (r=0.16, p<0.05), the levels of f. nucleatum sp. vincentii (r=0.15, p<0.05), porphyromonas gingivalis (r=0.14, p<0.05), and micromonas micros (r=0.17, p=0.01). e. corrodens was found in higher levels at implants with mucositis compared with implant health (p<0.05). subjects who lost teeth due to periodontitis had higher yields of f. nucleatum sp. vincentii (p<0.02) and n. mucosa (p<0.05). independent of implant status subjects with teeth had higher levels of p. gingivalis (p<0.05), and leptotrichia buccalis (p<0.05). conclusions: at implant sites studied, few bacteria differed by whether subjects were dentate or not or by implant status.

TI  == prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in aggressive periodontitis patients in a chilean population.
AB  == background: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is considered a major etiologic  agent of aggressive periodontitis (agp). other periodontopathic bacteria such as  porphyromonas gingivalis are also suspected of participating in aggressive periodontitis although the evidence to support this is controversial. the aim of  the present study was to determine the prevalence of eight periodontopathic bacteria in chilean patients with agp. methods: subgingival plaque samples were collected from 36 aggressive, 30 localized, and six generalized periodontitis patients. samples from 17 advanced chronic periodontitis (cp) patients were taken as controls. samples collected from the four deepest periodontal pockets in each  patient were pooled in prereduced transport fluid (rtf) and cultured. periodontal bacteria were primarily identified by colony morphology under stereoscopic microscope and rapid biochemical tests. the identity of some bacterial isolates was confirmed by colony polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: agp showed a significatively higher prevalence of c. rectus than cp (p = 0.036). the only statistical difference found was for c. rectus. patients with agp showed a higher, but not statistically significant, prevalence of p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, p. micros, and capnocytophaga sp. a similar prevalence in both groups  of patients was observed for f. nucleatum and p. intermedia/nigrescens, and a. actinomycetemcomitans was less prevalent in agp than cp patients. in localized agp, p. intermedia/nigrescens, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, and p. micros were the more prevalent pathogens in contrast to generalized agp patients who harbored a.  actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and capnocytophaga sp. as the most prevalent bacteria. conclusions: c. rectus, p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, p. micros, and capnocytophaga sp. were the most predominant periodontopathic bacteria of agp in this chilean population, but the only statistical difference found here between agp and cp was for c. rectus, suggesting that the differences  in clinical appearance may be caused by factors other than the microbiological composition of the subgingival plaque of these patients. in this study, the prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans was much lower than that of p. gingivalis.

TI  == detection and characterization of beta-lactamase genes in subgingival bacteria from patients with refractory periodontitis.
AB  == fifty-three beta-lactamase-producing strains of oral bacteria isolated from patients with refractory periodontitis in norway and usa were screened for the presence of the bla(tem), bla(shv), bla(oxa), bla(ampc), bla(cfxa), and bla(cepa/cbla) genes by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the pcr products were characterized by direct sequencing of the amplified dna. thirty-four of the  53 enzyme-producing strains (64%) were positive in one of the pcr assays. all beta-lactamase-producing prevotella and capnocytophaga spp. were cfxa positive. tem-type beta-lactamases were identified in one strain each of escherichia coli and neisseria sp., and one strain of citrobacter freundii possessed an ampc-type  beta-lactamase. screening for gene cassettes and genes known to be associated with integrons did not reveal the presence of integrons in these oral bacteria. sequence analyses showed that most cfxa positive prevotella and capnocytophaga isolates from patients with refractory periodontitis harboured variants of the cfxa2 and cfxa3 enzyme. the present study also showed that many different genetic determinants of beta-lactamase production are found in bacteria isolated from refractory periodontitis, many of which remain to be characterized.

TI  == beta-lactamase production and antimicrobial susceptibility of subgingival bacteria from refractory periodontitis.
AB  == this study assessed the extent of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in subgingival plaque samples obtained from 25 patients with refractory marginal periodontitis in the usa. beta-lactamase-positive isolates were characterized using commercial diagnostic kits and partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. the susceptibilities to different antimicrobial agents were tested and, in addition,  the isolates were screened for the presence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases  (esbls). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were detected in 18 (72%) patients. the most prominent beta-lactamase-producing organisms belonged to the anaerobic genus prevotella. other enzyme-producing anaerobic strains were fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes and peptostreptococcus sp. facultative bacteria, such as burkholderia spp., ralstonia pickettii, capnocytophaga spp., bacillus spp., staphylococcus spp. and neisseria sp., were also detected among the enzyme-producers. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ampicillin and  amoxicillin were in the range 1.5-256 micrograms/ml and 4-256 micrograms/ml, respectively, for the isolates of the prevotella species. all prevotella isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate and metronidazole, but they showed variable resistance to tetracyclines. two of the prevotella isolates had high mics of cefotaxime and ceftazidime. esbl activity was not detected in any of the  beta-lactamase-producing isolates by the etest method. thus, our study demonstrated a wide variety of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria that may play a  role in refractory periodontal disease.

TI  == gingival crevice microbiota from chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing  ulcerative gingivitis.
AB  == the objective of this study was to quantitatively compare the bacterial population structure in plaque from the gingival margin of two groups of 21 chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (nug). subjects were recruited in four dental clinics in eastern china. samples were quantitatively assessed by immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization for taxa known to be associated with periodontal diseases. the analyses showed that the fusiform taxa (fusobacterium nucleatum/fusobacterium periodonticum, leptotrichia buccalis, tannerella forsythensis, and capnocytophaga sp.), campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, selenomonas sputigena, and treponemes were present in both groups with high prevalence. porphyromonas gingivalis and actinomyces gerencseriae were much more  prevalent in the nug group. quantitatively, most taxa, including p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum and the treponemes, accounted, on average, for < 3% of the total bacterial cell number. only p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, p. gingivalis, s. sputigena, a. gerencseriae, and the sum of all monitored suspected periodontal pathogens were significantly increased in the nug group. the present study demonstrates for both groups a highly diverse plaque composition and suggests that, etiologically, the overall concentration and the concerted effects of the entire group of opportunistic pathogens thriving in nug-associated plaque are of  prime importance.

TI  == localized aggressive periodontitis in primary dentition: a case report.
AB  == background: a 5-year-old japanese boy presented with persistent gingival inflammation and severe mobility of the right lower primary incisors. due to severe alveolar bone loss and a deep periodontal pocket (5 mm), the incisors were extracted at the second visit. methods: clinical, radiographic, histological, and microbiological examinations were carried out. then, the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technique was employed to detect specific periodontal pathogens. the chemotactic activity of polymorphonuclear neutrophils was also measured. results: tannerella, capnocytophaga, fusobacterium, and eikenella sp. were recovered from the subgingival microflora around the right lower incisors, while  a. actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus), prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, and capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected using the pcr method. further chemotaxis assay revealed  that neutrophil function was depressed compared with that of healthy controls. conclusions: although inflammation remained around the right primary second molars, the bone loss was controlled by periodic professional mechanical teeth cleaning (pmtc), subgingival irrigation, and local antibiotic application. the probing depths of all teeth, including permanent incisors and molars, were within 2.5 mm.

TI  == microbiologic and radiographic analysis of ligature-induced peri-implantitis with different dental implant surfaces.
AB  == purpose: the goal of this study was to evaluate microbiota and radiographic peri-implant bone loss associated with ligature-induced peri-implantitis. materials and methods: thirty-six dental implants with 4 different surfaces (9 commercially pure titanium, 9 titanium plasma-sprayed, 9 hydroxyapatite, and 9 acid-etched) were placed in the edentulous mandibles of 6 dogs. after 3 months with optimal plaque control, abutment connection was performed. on days 0, 20, 40, and 60 after placement of cotton ligatures, both microbiologic samples and periapical radiographs were obtained. the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, campylobacter spp, capnocytophaga spp, fusobacterium spp,  beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and candida spp were evaluated culturally. results: p intermedia/nigrescens was detected in 13.89% of implants at baseline and 100% of implants at other periods. p gingivalis was not detected at baseline, but after 20 and 40 days it was detected in 33.34% of implants and at 60 days it was  detected in 29.03% of dental implants. fusobacterium spp was detected in all periods. streptococci were detected in 16.67% of implants at baseline and in 83.34%, 72.22%, and 77.42% of implants at 20, 40, and 60 days, respectively. campylobacter spp and candida spp were detected in low proportions. the total viable count analysis showed no significant differences among surfaces (p = .831), although a significant difference was observed after ligature placement (p < .0014). however, there was no significant qualitative difference, in spite of the difference among the periods. the peri-implant bone loss was not significantly different between all the dental implant surfaces (p = .908). discussion and conclusions: these data suggest that with ligature-induced peri-implantitis, both time and periodontal pathogens affect all surfaces equally after 60 days.

TI  == prevalent bacterial species and novel phylotypes in advanced noma lesions.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the bacterial diversity in advanced noma lesions using culture-independent molecular methods. 16s ribosomal dna bacterial genes from dna isolated from advanced noma lesions of four nigerian children were pcr amplified with universally conserved primers and spirochetal selective primers and cloned into escherichia coli. partial 16s rrna sequences of approximately 500 bases from 212 cloned inserts were used initially to determine  species identity or closest relatives by comparison with sequences of known species or phylotypes. nearly complete sequences of approximately 1,500 bases were obtained for most of the potentially novel species. a total of 67 bacterial  species or phylotypes were detected, 25 of which have not yet been grown in vitro. nineteen of the species or phylotypes, including propionibacterium acnes,  staphylococcus spp., and the opportunistic pathogens stenotrophomonas maltophilia and ochrobactrum anthropi were detected in more than one subject. other known species that were detected included achromobacter spp., afipia spp., brevundimonas diminuta, capnocytophaga spp., cardiobacterium sp., eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium spp., gemella haemoylsans, and neisseria spp. phylotypes that were unique to noma infections included those in the genera eubacterium, flavobacterium, kocuria, microbacterium, and porphyromonas and the related streptococcus salivarius and genera sphingomonas and treponema: since advanced noma lesions are infections open to the environment, it was not surprising to detect species not commonly associated with the oral cavity, e.g., from soil. several species previously implicated as putative pathogens of noma, such as spirochetes and fusobacterium spp., were detected in at least one subject. however, due to the limited number of available noma subjects, it was not possible at this time to associate specific species with the disease.

TI  == skin microflora and bacterial infections of the skin.
AB  == the skin is a milieu for controlled bacterial growth. skin supports the growth of commensal bacteria, which protect the host from pathogenic bacteria. environmental and local factors, host immunity, and organism adherence and virulence are intricately related to cutaneous infection. resident gram-positive  bacteria include staphylococcus, micrococcus, and corynebacterium sp. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes are notoriously pathogenic in the skin. in order for bacteria to be pathogenic, they must be able to adhere to, grow on, and invade the host. bacteria possess numerous virulence genes that allow for growth in these privileged niches. epidermal infections caused by s. aureus and s. pyogenes include impetigo and ecthyma. dermal infections consist of erysipelas, cellulitis, and necrotizing fasciitis. the pilosebaceous unit is involved in folliculitis, furunculosis, and carbunculosis. moreover, s. aureus and s. pyogenes produce toxins that may elicit a superantigen response, causing massive release of cytokines. staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, toxic shock syndrome, and scarlet fever are all superantigen-mediated. gram-negative organisms such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, pasteurella multocida, capnocytophaga canimorsus, bartonella sp., klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, and vibrio vulnificus are not typical resident skin microflora but may cause cutaneous infection.

TI  == the effect of scaling and root planing on the clinical and microbiological parameters of periodontal diseases: 12-month results.
AB  == background/aims: previously, we reported that srp resulted in a decrease in mean  pocket depth and attachment level and reduced prevalence and levels of bacteroidesforsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola at 3 and  6 months post-srp in 57 subjects with adult periodontitis. 32 of the 57 subjects  were monitored at 9 and 12 months. thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the microbial and clinical effects of srp in 32 (mean age 48+/-11) subjects over a 12-month period. method: clinical assessments of plaque, gingival redness, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth and attachment level were made prior to srp and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-therapy. subgingival plaque samples were taken at each visit and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique for the presence and levels of 40 subgingival species. each subject also received maintenance scaling at each of the subsequent monitoring visits. differences in clinical parameters and prevalence and levels of bacterial species were analyzed pre- and post-therapy using the wilcoxon signed ranks test. the quade test for related samples was used for analysis of multiple visits. results: mean pocket depth (mm+/-sem) decreased  from 3.2+/-0.3 at baseline to 2.9+/-0.3 at 12 months (p<0.01). mean attachment level showed significant reduction at 6 months, but did not diminish further. bleeding on probing and plaque were significantly reduced at 12 months (p<0.001,  p<0.05, respectively). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and t. denticola decreased in  prevalence and levels up to the 6-month visit and remained at these lower levels  at 9 and 12 months. significant increases in levels and prevalence were noted at  12 months for actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum ss polymorphum, streptococcus mitis, capnocytophaga sp, and veillonella parvula. conclusions: the data suggest that the maintenance phase of therapy may be essential in consolidating clinical and microbiological improvements achieved as a result of initial therapy.

TI  == comparative microbiological characteristics of failing implants and periodontally diseased teeth.
AB  == background: the purpose of this report was to compare the distribution of periodontal pathogens recovered from failing implants and teeth with adult and recurrent forms of periodontitis. methods: a total of 41 consecutive microbial samples from patients with failing implants (imp) were received at the microbiology testing laboratory (mtl) of the university of pennsylvania over a 2-year period. paired control samples were selected from samples received concurrently by mtl from 41 patients with a diagnosis of adult periodontitis (ap) and 41 with a diagnosis of recurrent or refractory periodontitis (rp). patients'  mean ages for the 3 categories were 59, 47, and 53 years, respectively. samples were collected with paper points or scalers and shipped in prereduced medium by express mail to the laboratory where they were processed within 48 hours from the time of collection. culture was used for detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, p. intermedia/nigrescens, e. corrodens, p. micros, capnocytophaga and  fusobacterium sp., enteric gram-negative rods, enterococcus and staphylococcus sp., and yeast. p. gingivalis and b. forsythus were detected by indirect immunofluorescence. morphotypes were enumerated by dark-field microscopy. results: the most frequently detected microorganisms from imp were b. forsythus (59%), spirochetes (54%), fusobacterium (41%), p. micros (39%), and p. gingivalis (27%). recovery levels (mean +/- sd) were 1+/-1, 4+/-5, 4+/-5, 9+/-11, 1+/-2, respectively. the most frequently detected organisms for ap were b. forsythus (83%), fusobacterium (80%), spirochetes (79%), p. gingivalis (59%), p. micros (51%), and e. corrodens (37%), at levels 2+/-2, 5+/-4, 9+/-6, 4+/-5, and 6+/-7, respectively. corresponding data for rp were b. forsythus (85%), fusobacterium (83%), p. gingivalis (60%), spirochetes (59%), c. rectus (56%), and p. micros (56%), at levels of 3+/-2, 8+/-8, 4+/-4, 2+/-2, 1+/-1, and 9+/-10, respectively.  conclusions: these results indicate that the detection frequency and levels of recovery of some periodontal pathogens in failing implants are significantly different from that of teeth with periodontitis; however, the detection frequency and levels of recovery are similar in teeth affected by adult and refractory (recurrent) forms of periodontitis.

AB  == taxon 1502 was originally described as a riemerella anatipestifer-like bacterium  causing exudative septicaemia in ducks and geese. in the present study, an integrated genotypic and phenotypic approach was used to elucidate the phylogenetic affiliation and taxonomic relationships of 12 strains of taxon 1502. whole-cell protein and fatty acid analyses and an extensive biochemical examination by using conventional tests and several api microtest systems indicated that all isolates formed a homogeneous taxon, which was confirmed by dna-dna hybridizations. 16s rdna sequence analysis of a representative strain (lmg 14382t) indicated that this taxon belongs to the cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides phylum and revealed a moderate but distinct  relationship to species of the genus capnocytophaga (overall 16s rdna sequence identities were 88.8-90.2%). taxon 1502 is concluded to represent a single species that should be allocated to a novel genus, and the name coenonia anatina  gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. the dna g + c content of representative strains  was 35-36 mol% and the type strain is lmg 14382t.

AB  == retropharyngeal abscess is reported to be decreasing in frequency in recent years. we report two cases of retropharyngeal abscess that were diagnosed within  four years in department of otorhinolaryngology, gifu university hospital. case 1 was a 36-year-old male who was suggested to have an abscess as primary infection  and case 2 was a 71-year-old female whose abscess seemed to be a secondary infection following unknown primary infection. endoscopic or open neck drainage as well as antibacterial chemotherapy mainly with combinations of flomoxef and clindamycin in the case 1 and piperacillin and clindamycin in the case 2 was successfully carried out. they were discharged an 15-day and 24-day after operation in the cases 1 and 2, respectively. a 30 min. culture after sample collection on operation demonstrated aerobe-anaerobe mixed infection in both cases; three aerobes and four anaerobes in the case 1 and three aerobes and two anaerobes in the case 2. these results suggest that retropharyngeal abscess may be a complicated infection involving more bacterial species than has been commonly believed. measuring susceptibility of isolates to antimicrobial agents,  a strain of capnocytophaga sp. and a strain of anaerobic gram-negative rod were highly resistant to piperacillin, cefroxine and ofloxacin. it is important for adequate antibacterial chemotherapy to grasp the bacteriology of retropharyngeal  abscess and analyze susceptibility of antimicrobial agents.

TI  == comparison of randomly cloned and whole genomic dna probes for the detection of porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus.
AB  == whole genomic and randomly-cloned dna probes for two fastidious periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus were labeled with digoxigenin and detected by a colorimetric method. the specificity and sensitivity of the whole genomic and cloned probes were compared. the cloned probes were highly specific compared to the whole genomic probes. a significant degree of cross-reactivity with bacteroides species, capnocytophaga sp. and prevotella sp. was observed with the whole genomic probes. the cloned probes were less sensitive than the whole genomic probes and required at least 10(6) target cells or a minimum of 10 ng of target dna to be detected during hybridization. although a ten-fold increase in sensitivity was obtained with the whole genomic probes, cross-hybridization to closely related species limits their reliability in identifying target bacteria in subgingival plaque samples.

TI  == growth differences of capnocytophaga canimorsus strains and some other fastidious organisms on various columbia-based blood agar media.
AB  == three human isolates of capnocytophaga canimorsus from blood cultures showed no growth when cultivated on sheep blood agar plates based on bbl columbia agar base, whereas the same three strains grew excellently on sheep blood agar plates  based on difco columbia agar bases no. 2 or eh. two of the three strains also grew well on blood agar plates based on biomerieux columbia agar. strains that grew better on either difco or biomerieux columbia based blood agar plates were found among eikenella corrodens, haemophilus aphrophilus, kingella kingae, lactobacillus sp., and streptococcus adjacens, but these strains were never lost  when cultivated on bbl columbia agar plates. one strain of lactobacillus failed to grow on difco columbia no. 2 agar and showed best growth on biomerieux columbia agar. strains of corynebacterium g 2, corynebacterium afermentans and streptococcus adjacens showed poor growth on chocolate agar when compared to blood agar media. microbiologists should be aware of the importance of media formulations for optimal recovery of fastidious organisms.

TI  == clinical and microbiological changes associated with an altered subgingival environment induced by periodontal pocket reduction.
AB  == the purpose of the present investigation was to study the effect of an altered subgingival environment, induced by changing the local soft tissue morphology, i.e., pocket depth reduction, on the subgingival microbiota and the clinical conditions. 7 patients aged 30-60 years with generalized marginal periodontitis were selected. patients were instructed in proper oral hygiene and all teeth were cleaned supragingivally. mucoperiosteal flaps were raised and the bone re-contoured to eliminate angular bony defects. while the control teeth were carefully debrided and thoroughly root planed, no root instrumentation was performed on the test teeth. calculus deposits visible to the naked eye were only chipped-off with the tip of a scaler. the flaps were apically repositioned and sutured at the level of the bone crest. clinical parameters showed a similar pattern of response in the test and control sites over a one year observation period post therapy. probing depths and probing attachment levels were significantly reduced one month after surgery and remained at a lower level. a significant decrease was also noted for total anaerobic viable bacterial counts.  the proportion of the gram-negative anaerobic rods decreased significantly in both groups. p. gingivalis, fusobacterium sp., c rectus were detected significantly less often after treatment in both groups. capnocytophaga and a. odontolyticus, on the other hand, were more frequently isolated after therapy. these findings corroborate the concept that the reduction of selected subgingival microorganisms is the key element for the success of periodontal therapy, rather  than the removal of tooth substance and mineralized deposits by root instrumentation.

TI  == microbial keratitis in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.
AB  == background: posterior segment complications of systemic infection with the human  immunodeficiency virus (hiv) are well recognized. the anterior segment complications often are, however, overlooked. the author treated 20 episodes of nonherpetic infectious keratitis in 17 eyes of 13 patients infected with hiv who  presented between august 1990 and may 1994. methods: review of records. results:  nine patients were women, and four were men. mean age was 35.2 years. the keratitis was bilateral in four patients, polymicrobial in four, and recurrent in two. the most common infecting organism was candida albicans (5 eyes), a rare cause of keratitis in immunocompetent individuals. other organisms included staphylococcus aureus in four eyes, staphylococcus epidermidis in four, bacillus  sp in two, and one each pseudomonas aeruginosa, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, micrococcus sp, and capnocytophaga sp. seven eyes retained 20/30 or better visual acuity after treatment, eight had visual acuity of 20/50 or worse, and two were eviscerated. classic predisposing factors for infectious keratitis were found in  only two patients and included contact lens wear and atopy in one patient each. twelve patients had a history of intravenous drug abuse. conclusion: infectious keratitis should be recognized as a complication of systemic hiv infection, especially in the context of drug abuse. the prognosis for recovery of vision in  these patients often is poor.

TI  == occurrence of certain bacterial species and morphotypes in juvenile periodontitis in chile.
AB  == the occurrence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga species, and certain bacterial morphotypes was determined in 18 affected and 18 unaffected sites in 10 localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp) patients, and in 10 affected and 10 unaffected sites in 5 generalized juvenile periodontitis (gjp) patients. the subgingival proportion of  the 7 bacterial species was determined by selective and nonselective culturing. the results showed that when considering the pure prevalence of bacteria ( > 0%)  there were significant differences (p < 0.05) in the subgingival plaque microflora of the affected sites versus those of the unaffected sites for p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia, e. corrodens, c. rectus, and f. nucleatum in ljp, and for p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and f. nucleatum in gjp. the mean proportions of cocci, motile rods and spirochetes were also significantly different (p < 0.05) in affected sites compared to unaffected sites. capnocytophaga sp, f. nucleatum, p. intermedia, and e. corrodens were found in more than 75% of affected sites in ljp. when taking the approach that an organism, to be associated with periodontal disease, has to be detected above a certain minimum threshold, the results indicated that bacteria most frequently associated with ljp and gjp in chile are p. gingivalis (66% of ljp and 80% of gjp affected sites), and a. actinomycetemcomitans (44% of ljp and 50% in gjp affected sites). different bacterial species may be judged to be important in the disease  process depending upon whether a pure bacterial prevalence, or a prevalence above a certain detection level, is considered.

TI  == succession of putative peri-implant pathogens after root-form and plate-form implant placement in partially dentate adult monkeys.
AB  == this report describes the succession of putative peri-implant pathogens in partially dentate monkeys after dental implantation and prosthetic reconstruction. tooth and implant (6 root-end form, 4 blade-vent implants) sites  in eight monkeys were monitored microbiologically and clinically during the pre-implant stage, abutment connection stage, bridge placement stage, and three and six months after the bridge placement stage. tooth and implant sites were cleaned monthly post-extraction. microbiological studies included dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and primary phenotypic characterization of culture isolates. after implant surgery, the median proportion of several putative peri-implant pathogens studied were significantly  elevated. following fixture placement, p. intermedia replaced p. melaninogenica as the predominant black pigmented anaerobic bacilli (bpab) in the mouth. after abutment connection stage, levels of p. intermedia, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f.  nucleatun, haemophilus sp. and spirochetes were significantly elevated at implant and tooth sites. three months after bridge installations, p. intermedia and a. actinomycetemcomitans remained significantly elevated at implant sites. at six months after bridge installation, levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans declined significantly relative to levels at three months.  porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes were not significantly elevated although their  levels correlated with gingival redness. p. intermedia, porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes levels correlated significantly with probing depth. correlation was detected between p. gingivalis and spirochetes; and between a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum. our studies show a transitional increase  in levels of several organisms resembling putative pathogens of human peri-implant infection, associated with implant placements in partially edentulous mouths and supports early prophylactic interventions to control their  levels.

TI  == clinical, microbiological and host defense parameters associated with a case of localized prepubertal periodontitis.
AB  == a 4-year-old japanese boy was referred to osaka university dental hospital because of severe mobility and pain of the right lower primary canine. the canine had severe bone loss and a pocket depth exceeding 5-6 mm. the left lower canine showed slight mobility and moderate alveolar bone loss. the other primary teeth showed no pathogenic findings. the subgingival microflora from the right lower canine was dominated by gram-negative rods, especially capnocytophaga and fusobacterium, while actinomyces sp. were the most common gram-positive bacteria. while neutrophil functions of the patient were within the normal ranges of healthy subjects, some lymphocyte functions such as il-2 production and igg and igm syntheses were lower in the patient. 7 months after the extraction of the right lower primary canine, the patient complained of pain around the right lower primary lateral incisor. in 3-4 weeks, the alveolar bone was lost rapidly and mobility of the lower anterior teeth increased significantly. the primary lateral incisor was extracted and the other primary teeth were treated by sealing and systemic and local administration of antibiotics. after treatment, the lower anterior teeth became less mobile and the gram-positive cocci predominated.

AB  == two new capnocytophaga species, for which we propose the names capnocytophaga haemolytica and capnocytophaga granulosa, were isolated from supragingival dental plaque of adults. the phenotypic characteristics of these organisms were the same as those of the genus capnocytophaga: gram-negative rods; co2 requirement; gliding motility; catalase negative; oxidase negative; acids produced from d-glucose, d-maltose, d-mannose, and d-sucrose; and acetate and succinate are the major end products of glucose fermentation. in addition, the cellular fatty acid  contents and menaquinones of both species were similar to the cellular fatty acid contents and menaquinones of other capnocytophaga species. nevertheless, the levels of dna-dna relatedness of the two new species to each other and to other capnocytophaga species were less than 20%. two notable characteristics of c. haemolytica are the presence of hemolytic activity and the lack of aminopeptidase activity. c. granulosa has granular inclusions in its cells and grows aerobically. the type strains of c. haemolytica and c. granulosa are a0404 (= jcm 8565) and b0611 (= jcm 8566), respectively.

AB  == the phylogenetic position and various genotypic, chemotaxonomic, and classical phenotypic characteristics of 21 gram-negative avian isolates were studied. these strains constitute a genotypically homogeneous taxon in rrna superfamily v, as shown by dna-rrna hybridization data. determination of the 16s rrna sequence of this taxon revealed its detailed position within the "flavobacter" subgroup of the "flavobacter-bacteroides" phylum as described by gherna and woese (r. gherna  and c. r. woese, syst. appl. microbiol. 15:513-521, 1992). this new taxon is only distantly related to other members of the "flavobacter-bacteroides" phylum and is therefore given separate generic status. the dna-dna binding values for members of this taxon, for which we propose the name ornithobacterium rhinotracheale, confirmed that all of the strains are highly interrelated (dna-dna binding values greater than 90% were measured). the g+c contents of members of this taxon are between 37 and 39 mol%. an analysis of the cellular proteins and fatty acids and  classical phenotypic characteristics allowed us to distinguish o. rhinotracheale  from phenotypically similar taxa, such as riemerella anatipestifer and capnocytophaga species. the respiratory quinone content (menaquinone 7) and carbohydrate pattern of o. rhinotracheale conform with the respiratory quinone contents and carbohydrate patterns of other members of rrna superfamily v.

TI  == sub-gingival microflora in macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey.
AB  == the macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey is one of several non-human primate (nhp) models for periodontal disease. this report presents the bacteriology of the gingival sulci in m. mulatta monkeys. three sub-gingival sites (maxillary right central incisor, the disto-buccal of the mandibular left second molar and mesio-buccal of the mandibular right second molar) of 9 monkeys were evaluated clinically before scaling and 7 days after scaling. plaque samples were obtained  from sub-gingival sites before clinical examination and studied bacteriologically by dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and by primary phenotypic characterizations of culture isolates. several gingival sites presented with mild gingival inflammation. anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic  bacteria were the predominant flora colonizing the gingival sulci. the major microbial groups were haemophilus species (100% of sites; percentage of total anaerobic count (tac): 21-51), peptostreptococcus micros (89%, 7.5-29.5), actinomyces sp. (85%, 7-27), fusobacterium nucleatum (90%, 5-8), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (73%, 1.3-12), black-pigmented anaerobic rods (bpar) (80%,  0.6-6.5) and oral streptococci (80%, 0.2-1.0). microbial groups detected less often were wolinella sp. (66%, 0-2.6), capnocytophaga sp. (30%), eikenella corrodens (4.7%, 0), campylobacter sp. (28%, 0-0.1) and spirochetes (4.7%, 0-0.07). seven days after gingival sites were scaled, the plaque score and indices for gingival inflammation declined significantly. the gingival flora after scaling were characterized by lower proportions of the actinomyces sp., p.  micros and bpar; and increased proportions of the oral streptococci, relative to  pre-scaling levels.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == dental bacterial plaques. nature and role in periodontal disease.
AB  == antony van leeuwenhoek first described oral bacteria. however, not until almost 200 years later was the famous koch postulate introduced. since then, research has extensively been performed regarding the development and microbiology of dental plaques. in spite of the complexity of the developing flora of supragingival plaque, culture studies have shown a remarkably orderly succession  of organisms. lately, the concept of microbial specificity in the etiology of periodontal diseases has been widely suggested, i.e., that different forms of periodontal disease are associated with qualitatively distinct dental plaques. cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of the predominant cultivable microflora reveal that only a small number of the over 300 species found in human subgingival plaques are associated with periodontal disease. among the commonly mentioned are: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, capnocytophaga sp., eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, and wolinella recta, as well as certain gram-positive bacteria such as eubacterium species. anti-infective therapy for many systemic infections equals the use of antimicrobial drugs. however, for localized infections like periodontal diseases, treatment may consist of a combination of mechanical wound  debridement and the application of an antimicrobial agent. the general effectiveness of mechanical anti-infective therapy and successful oral hygiene in the management of periodontal disease is well established in the literature and has met the test of success in clinical practice for most cases of periodontitis  in adults. the definition of periodontal pathogens as either opportunistic pathogens, or as exogenous pathogens carries with it significant implications.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == changes in subgingival microbiota during puberty. a 4-year longitudinal study.
AB  == it was the purpose of the present investigation to monitor the composition of the subgingival microbiota at selected sites in individuals passing through puberty and to correlate observed changes with the development of pubertal maturation. between the ages of 11 and 14 years, pubertal and skeletal maturation was monitored annually in 22 boys and 20 girls. during this time, subgingival microbial samples were taken every 4th to 5th month (10 times in 4 years) mesially of the upper first molars. high values in total bacterial counts were reached after the onset of puberty, followed by a decrease towards the end of the observation period. the frequency of detection of actinomyces odontolyticus and of capnocytophaga sp. increased with time. the frequencies of other selected species, specifically of black pigmenting bacteriodes sp. were not found to increase when tested by linear and quadratic models of time trend. however, a statistically significant rise in the frequency of detecting b. intermedius and b. melaninogenicus was noted in the initial pubertal phase identified by the onset of testicular growth in boys (p = 0.05). a significant relationship also existed between testes growth and increase of a. odontolyticus (p less than 0.01). in girls, a similar increase was obtained for a. odontolyticus when studied in relation to the tanner scores for breast development (p less than 0.01). the changes observed in the subgingival microbiota during puberty may be related to the development of gingivitis, which was demonstrated by a higher tendency for gingival bleeding during the course of the pubertal maturation process.

TI  == microbial changes associated with the development of puberty gingivitis.
AB  == in this study, longitudinal changes in the composition of the subgingival microbiota of children between the ages of 11 and 14 and their association with changes of clinical parameters describing gingival health were investigated. during 4 years, subgingival microbial samples were taken in 22 boys and 20 girls  10 times. at the same time the gingival bleeding tendency was recorded by the papillary bleeding index (pbi). a total of 840 samples was evaluated using darkfield microscopy and anaerobic culturing on non-selective and selective media. children, who developed a marked and sustained increase in mean pbi scores (n = 21), had higher frequencies and mean proportions of spirochetes and eikenella corrodens than children without pronounced puberty gingivitis (p less than = 0.05). the mean proportion of actinomyces viscosus was also higher in these children (p less than = 0.05). among the species discriminated, only capnocytophaga sp. were found at a higher rate in samples taken immediately before a rise of pbi (p less than = 0.05). the detection frequencies of black-pigmented bacteroides (particularly b. intermedius) increased later, and were significantly elevated after the establishment of a high bleeding tendency (p less than = 0.05). these findings implicate capnocytophaga sp. in the initiation of puberty gingivitis, whereas the increased presence of bacteroides may reflect a change in the subgingival environment secondary to increased bleeding.

AB  == 29 periodontally healthy subjects (11 female and 18 male) with a mean age of 24 years (range 19 to 38 years) and with partially erupted lower third molars participated in this study. 18 subjects demonstrated no signs or symptoms of acute inflammation and were without pain (group a). 5 subjects showed redness of  the pericoronal tissues and experienced pain upon palpation (group b). 6 subjects suffered from acute pain and exhibited formation of pus (group c). microbiological samples were taken from the lateral aspect of the pericoronal space using the paperpoint-method. continuous anaerobic techniques were utilized  for microbiological processing. the samples were cultivated on etsa and on selective media and were studied by darkfield microscopy. gram-negative anaerobic rods accounted for 27% (group a), 34% (group b) and 39% (group c) of all organisms growing on etsa. bacteroides intermedius was detected in 61% (group a), 80% (group b) and 83% (group c) of the samples. b. gingivalis was found in 1 sample of group a only. fusobacterium sp. was detected in 56% (group a), 80% (group b) and 33% (group c) of the samples. capnocytophaga were seen in 67% (group a), 20% (group b) and 50% of the samples. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was found in 44% (group a), 40% (group b) and 17% (group c). 72% of the group a and 100% of the group b and c samples contained spirochetes. in all of those positive samples, small spirochetes were present, but only 78% contained medium and only 48% large spirochetes.(abstract truncated  at 250 words)

TI  == humoral immune responses in experimental gingivitis in rats.
AB  == serum igg, igm, and iga antibody levels to extracts of rat dental plaque and five oral bacteria (haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans y-4, bacteroides gingivalis 381, bact. intermedius atcc 25261, capnocytophaga sp. m-12, eikenella corrodens odu) were determined by elisa. in addition, the presence of rat dental plaque and oral bacterial components in the inflamed gingival tissue was studied using immunofluorescence techniques. serum and gingival tissue samples were obtained from odu plaque-susceptible and plaque-resistant rats. in several susceptible rats, igg, igm, and iga antibodies against dental plaque and oral bacteria were detected. there was a correlation between the levels of igg antibody to dental plaque and pocket probing depth, but not between pocket probing depth and the levels of igm and iga. furthermore, components of rat dental plaque and oral bacteria were detected in the inflamed gingival tissue.

TI  == [osseointegrated implants in clinical dentistry. follow up maintenance phase].
AB  == the aim of this study is to determine the method of maintenance care for support  the functional condition during long period. the present paper reports on the result of osseointegrated titanium fixture in four complete denture patients. the marginal soft tissue reactions were investigated at the 1st, 3rd, 6th, 12th and 18th month after prothetic restrations by clinical examination and microbiological observations. all abutments were surrounded by clinically in healthy gingiva, however most individuals with the implant fixture had used as a  complete denture for many years, without oral hygiene. for a favorable prognosis  of the implant-recipients, self plaque control should be acquired for the patients shortly after prothetic restration. before the healing phase, it is necessary to recall frequently for maintenance marginal soft tissue and prothetic restoration. after healing and remodeling phase, the interval of maintenance care was decided on each 3rd months. the interval seemed practically reasonable because the 18th month later the prognosis was satisfactory. this report presents two cases of complications during the maintenance phase of osseointegrated implants. case i: a 72-year-old female patient presented gingival hyperplasia formation around the abutment after 19th months on abutment setting. we performed excision of the hyperplastic gingiva and apically positioned flap. probing depth  (pd) could not be determined because of gingival hyperplasia formation before operation, but there was marking reduction of probing depth after operation. the  gingival bleeding index (gbi) was improved and the amount of gingival crevicular  fluid (gcf) was reduced after operation. in pre-operative anaerobic culture, the  proportions of capnocytophaga species and haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans were  found. post-operatively, capnocytophaga sp. was not found, but h. actinomycetemcomitans was unchanged. case ii: a 47-year-old male patient presented gingivitis around the abutment after 13th months on abutment setting. we performed cleaning of the abutment surface with the flap procedure. furthermore, a joint screw between the fixture and abutment was adapted due to loosening after operation, pd was unchanged, gbi was improved and gcf was slightly reduced. in pre-operative anaerobic culture, bacteroides intermedius was rich. post-operatively, b. intermedius was not found. in conclusion, we advocate  that maintenance care of osseointegrated implants is the most important factor in the procedure.

TI  == comparison of gc-lect and modified thayer-martin media for isolation of neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  == a new selective medium, gc-lect, was compared with modified thayer-martin medium  (mtm) for isolation of neisseria gonorrhoeae. cultures from 620 sexually transmitted disease clinic patients were directly inoculated onto both media, placed in candle extinction jars, and incubated. n. gonorrhoeae was isolated from 175 (29%) of 607 genital cultures, 3 (3%) of 88 pharyngeal cultures, and 6 (29%)  of 21 rectal cultures. ten cultures were positive only on gc-lect, and 3 were positive only on mtm. in 3 of the 10 cultures positive only on gc-lect, overgrowth of a capnocytophaga sp. may have obscured growth on mtm. in this study, vancomycin-susceptible (mic, less than 4.0 micrograms/ml) n. gonorrhoeae was isolated on both media, and none of the isolates missed by either medium were susceptible to vancomycin. no differences were noted between the two media in time required for isolation of n. gonorrhoeae. while isolation rates of n. gonorrhoeae were similar, suppression of nongonococcal bacterial species by gc-lect was superior to that by mtm. gc-lect is equal to mtm for detection of n.  gonorrhoeae and is superior for suppression of normal flora.

TI  == relationship of subgingival plaque flora to lysosomal and cytoplasmic enzyme activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == examining the relationships among indicators of the acute inflammatory response in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) and specific bacterial species in subgingival  plaque may provide indications of which bacterial species or groups of species may be associated with potentially destructive host-derived processes. here we report on the relationship of the subgingival plaque flora to the activity of mammalian forms of the enzymes beta-glucuronidase (beta g), lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), and arylsulfatase (as) in gcf from a total of 54 4-6 mm periodontal sites  from 13 periodontitis patients. sites were scored for probing depth (pd) and bleeding on probing, and gcf was collected using filter paper strips inserted into the sulcus for 30 s, eluted in buffer and assayed for enzyme activity. 1 week later, the patients were again evaluated for pd and bleeding, and subgingival plaque was removed with a curette oriented toward the pocket epithelium. plaque samples were examined by darkfield microscopy and cultured anaerobically on selective and non-selective media. various groups of bacteria, including species of black pigmenting bacteroides (bpb), fusobacterium sp., capnocytophaga sp, streptococcus sanguis, and total facultative organisms were enumerated. relationships among the enzymes and bacterial groups expressed as colony-forming unit (cfu) counts or as a % of the total cultivable flora were assessed by spearman correlation analysis. beta g levels were significantly correlated with populations of spirochetes, b. intermedius, b. gingivalis, and total lactose negative bpb's. correlation between beta g and f. nucleatum sp. or  capnocytophaga sp. approached but did not reach statistically significant levels. in contrast, ldh activity showed a significant positive correlation with levels of b. gingivalis and total lactose negative bpb's. as levels were significantly correlated only with b. gingivalis. beta g and ldh showed a significant negative  correlation with levels of coccoid forms. thus, beta g, an acid hydrolase which can serve as a marker for primary granule release from polymorphonuclear leukocytes, was most closely correlated with the micro-organisms found in other studies to be associated with chronic adult periodontitis.

TI  == capnocytophaga canimorsus sp. nov. (formerly cdc group df-2), a cause of septicemia following dog bite, and c. cynodegmi sp. nov., a cause of localized wound infection following dog bite.
AB  == cdc group df-2 is the vernacular name given to a slow-growing gram-negative bacterium that causes septicemia and meningitis in humans. infections frequently  (one-third of cases) occur following dog bites or close contact with dogs or occasionally with cats. splenectomy and alcoholism appear to be strong predisposing factors for df-2 infection. in addition to 150 df-2 strains received for identification, we received 9 df-2-like strains; 6 were isolated from wound or eye infections, 3 of which were associated with dog bites and 1 of which was associated with a cat scratch, and 3 were isolated from dog mouths. the major characteristics of df-2 include production of acid but no gas from lactose and maltose and usually d-glucose; positive reactions for oxidase, catalase, arginine dihydrolase, gliding motility, and o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside; growth enhanced by serum and by incubation in a candle jar atmosphere; and negative reactions for sucrose, raffinose, inulin, melibiose, nitrate reduction, indole, and growth on macconkey agar. df-2-like strains had the same characteristics, except that acid was formed from sucrose, raffinose, inulin, and melibiose. by the hydroxyapatite method, dnas from 12 df-2 strains were 88% related in 60 degrees c reactions and 84% related in 75 degrees c reactions. related sequences  contained 0.5 to 1.5% unpaired bases (divergence). three df-2-like strains were 73 to 80% related at 60 degrees c (with 2.0 to 2.5% divergence) and 68 to 75% related at 75 degrees c. the relatedness of df-2 and df-2-like strains was 19 to  31% at 60 degrees celsius and 13 to 19% at 75 degrees celsius. the relatedness of df-2 and df-2-like strains to capnocytophaga species was 4 to 7%. the dna relatedness date indicate that eh df-2 and the df-2-like strains are separate, previously undescribed species. both groups are phenotypically and genetically distinct from capnocytophaga species, although they do share several characteristics with capnocytophaga species, including cellular morphology, gliding motility, cellular fatty acid composition, enhancement of growth in a candle jar atmosphere, and g+c content. the new species differ from capnocytophaga species by their positive oxidase and catalase reactions. we chose to avoid creating a new genus and proposed the names capnocytophaga canimorsus sp. nov. for group df-2 and c. cynodegmi sp. nov. for the df-2-like strains.

TI  == rapidly progressive periodontitis. neutrophil chemotaxis inhibitory factors associated with the presence of bacteroides gingivalis in crevicular fluid.
AB  == in the last few years several bacteriological and immunological studies have investigated the role of bacteria and immune defects in order to establish the etiopathogenesis of periodontal disease. with regard to the immune system, a defect in polymorphonuclear neutrophil (pmn) chemotaxis has been frequently reported in patients with rapidly progressive or juvenile periodontitis. the purpose of this study was to investigate in five patients with rapidly progressive periodontitis and normal chemotaxis of peripheral blood pmns the presence of chemotaxis inhibitory activity in gingival fluid and to relate such activity to three types of bacteria, often involved in rapidly evolving periodontal lesions, that are able to inhibit in vitro pmn chemotaxis: bacteroides gingivalis, capnocytophaga sp., and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. we found strong inhibitory activity in three of these patients. this activity was consistently associated with the finding of b. gingivalis in gingival pockets. we cannot rule out, however, that other substances not of bacterial origin could be responsible for such inhibitory activity. the strict association with b. gingivalis, known to secrete blocking factors, is highly suggestive, although this data must be considered preliminary.

TI  == immunoglobulin g response to subgingival gram-negative bacteria in human subjects.
AB  == serum and gingival crevicular fluid from normal healthy adults and patients with  periodontitis were screened for immunoglobulin g antibodies to antigens from bacteroides gingivalis 381, bacteroides intermedius 24, bacteroides loescheii atcc 15930, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586, eikenella corrodens 1073, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans atcc 29522, and capnocytophaga sp. strain m-12. immunoglobulin g antibody titers to the antigens were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the antibody levels to b. gingivalis in serum  and gingival crevicular fluid were significantly higher in the samples from patients with periodontitis than in samples from healthy individuals. although there were individual differences within patient groups, a positive correlation (p less than 0.01) was found between the serum immunoglobulin g levels to b. gingivalis and the development of periodontitis. the antibodies to f. nucleatum (p less than 0.05), e. corrodens (p less than 0.05), and a. actinomycetemcomitans were slightly higher in patients with periodontitis than in normal subjects. there were no remarkable differences between the two groups in titers to b. intermedius, b. loescheii, and capnocytophaga sp.

TI  == sulfonolipids of gliding bacteria. structure of the n-acylaminosulfonates.
AB  == earlier (godchaux, w., and leadbetter, e. r. (1980) j. bacteriol. 144, 592-602; (1983) j. bacteriol. 153, 1238-1246) we demonstrated that an unusual class of sulfonolipids are major components of the cell envelope of gliding bacteria of the genus cytophaga and of closely related genera. one of these lipids, to which  we have assigned the trivial name capnine, was purified and was shown to be 2-amino-3-hydroxy-15-methylhexadecane-1-sulfonic acid (which might also be named  as 1-deoxy-15-methylhexadecasphinganine-1-sulfonic acid). though capnine accumulates as such in the cells of some capnocytophaga spp., most organisms of the cytophaga-like genera contain, instead, sulfonolipids that are less polar than capnine. these less polar lipids have been purified from a capnocytophaga sp., a marine cytophaga sp., cytophaga johnsonae, and a flexibacter sp. acid methanolysis of the lipids yielded both aminosulfonates and a collection of fatty acid methyl esters. the infrared absorption spectra of the lipids indicated that  the fatty acids were in amide (and not ester) linkage to the aminosulfonates. in  every instance, analysis by mass spectrometry and other methods revealed that most, if not all, of the aminosulfonates obtained by methanolysis were structurally identical to capnine (though small amounts of variants of that compound may be present in some cases). the less polar sulfonolipids are, therefore, predominantly n-fatty acyl capnines, 1-deoxy-1-sulfonic acid analogs of ceramides. the fatty acid methyl esters obtained from the lipids were heterogeneous, but in all cases were rich in hydroxylated fatty acyl groups, which constituted 66 to 95% of the total.

TI  == puberty gingivitis in insulin-dependent diabetic children. i. cross-sectional observations.
AB  == this cross-sectional study examined the gingivitis occurring at puberty in a population of insulin-dependent juvenile diabetics. seventy-seven children between the ages of 6 and 15 years were examined for gingivitis levels, stages of pubertal maturation and blood levels of glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin. bacterial plaque was sampled from one or more approximal tooth surfaces of every  subject and cultured under anaerobic and aerobic conditions on nonselective and selective media. the total cultivable flora and percentage of certain presumptive periodontopathic bacteria were determined. before puberty, children with "high" levels of glycosylated hemoglobin also had higher gingivitis levels than children with "normal" metabolic control of diabetes. during puberty, the level of gingivitis increased independently from both fasting blood glucose levels and per cent glycosylated hemoglobin. the microbiota of marginal plaque was predominantly composed of facultatively anaerobic bacteria. the percentages of capnocytophaga sp and actinomyces naeslundii were statistically higher at the onset of puberty,  suggesting that a specific bacterial shift in the microbial composition of marginal plaque occurs in response to host changes in juvenile diabetic children  at this age period.

TI  == relationship between oxygen tension and subgingival bacterial flora in untreated  human periodontal pockets.
AB  == the predominance of anaerobic bacteria in subgingival plaque samples suggests that the pocket environment is anaerobic. in the present investigation, a small oxygen tension (po2) electrode was inserted into the base of the pocket and the po2 was recorded. in addition, the plaque in these pockets was examined culturally and microscopically. the oxygen tension at the bottom of 36 pockets (5 to 10 mm in depth) ranged from 5 to 27 mmhg (1 mmhg congruent to 133.3 pa) with a mean value of 13.3 mmhg. moderate pockets (5 and 6 mm) exhibited a mean po2 of 15.7 mmhg, which was significantly higher than the 12.0 mmhg found in the deeper  pockets. the deep pockets had higher percentages of spirochetes and bacteroides intermedius, whereas the moderate pockets had elevated proportions of actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus mutans. the sites with oxygen tensions equal to or less than 15 mmhg had significantly higher percentages of spirochetes, whereas the microaerophilic capnocytophaga species were found in pockets with a po2 greater than 15 mmhg. the presence of bleeding in the pocket was associated with  higher proportions of b. intermedius, capnocytophaga sp., and a. naeslundii. these po2 readings of periodontal pockets indicated that there is a spectrum of po2 values which seem to define, in a general way, the microbiological composition of the pocket.

TI  == unusual sulfonolipids are characteristic of the cytophaga-flexibacter group.
AB  == capnocytophaga spp. contain a group of unusual sulfonolipids, called capnoids (w. godchaux iii and e. r. leadbetter, j. bacteriol. 144:592-602, 1980). one of these lipids, capnine, is 2-amino-3-hydroxy-15-methylhexadecane-1-sulfonic acid; the others are, apparently, n-acylated versions of capnine. the lipids were found, in amounts ranging from 2.5 to 16 mumol of capnoid sulfur per g of cells (wet weight), in two cytophaga spp. and also in several closely related organisms: several capnocytophaga spp., sporocytophaga myxococcoides, two flexibacter spp.,  and two flavobacterium spp. with the exception of the flavobacteria, all of these bacteria have been shown to exhibit gliding motility. the two flavobacterium spp. belong to a subset of that genus that shares many other characteristics with the  cytophagas. only the capnocytophaga spp. contained large quantities of capnine as such; in all of the others, most (and possibly all) of the capnoids were present  as n-acylcapnines. capnoid-negative bacteria included some gliding organisms that may not be closely related to the cytophagas: two fruiting myxobacters, a gliding cyanobacterium (plectonema sp.), beggiatoa alba, vitreoscilla stercoraria, herpetosiphon aurantiacus, and lysobacter enzymogenes. nongliding bacteria representing nine genera were also tested, and all of these fell into the capnoid-negative group.
