TI  == impact of a resistant dextrin on intestinal ecology: how altering the digestive ecosystem with nutriose(r), a soluble fibre with prebiotic properties, may be beneficial for health.
AB  == objectives: the prebiotic potential of nutriose(r)--a sugar-free, digestion-resistant dextrin--was evaluated in two randomized, placebo-controlled  trials that included 48 and 40 healthy volunteers, respectively. methods: in study 1, the effect on colonic bacteria of nutriose(r) 10, 15 or 20 g/day administered for 14 days was examined; in study 2, gut microbial changes in response to nutriose(r) 8 g/day for 14 days were monitored using real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. results: nutriose(r) increased proliferation  of bacteroides and inhibited clostridum perfringens in both studies, increased beta-glucosidase activity (at 10 and 15 g/day) and decreased colonic ph (at 20 g/day). the increase in short-chain fatty acid production with nutriose(r) consumption was not statistically significant. there were no indications of gastrointestinal intolerance at any dose. conclusions: according to commonly accepted definitions, nutriose(r) is a prebiotic soluble fibre that provides a beneficial effect on colonic ecology while preserving digestive comfort.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of propolis and other substances against selected endodontic pathogens.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial effect of ethanol extract of propolis (eep) and intracanal medicaments calcium hydroxide, camphorated paramonochlorophenol, and formocresol by means of the macrodilution method using the reinforced clostridial medium (rcm) and brucella and brain heart infusion media. study design: the antimicrobial agents were sequentially diluted  and tested against anaerobic bacteria prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces israelii, and clostridium perfringens and against enterococcus faecalis, with the 5 x 10(5) cfu/ml standardized inocula. the tubes  were anaerobically incubated and the minimum inhibitory concentration was detected. blood agar rcm subcultures were performed to provide minimum bactericidal concentration. the results were analyzed by analysis of variance test. results: all drugs were effective against all tested strains, without statistical differences. e. faecalis was the less susceptible strain, and rcm broth promoted faster bacterial growth, but there were no significant differences in these results. ethanol did not influence the antimicrobial effect of eep.

TI  == recent advances in antibiotic regimens for the treatment of obstetric-gynecologic infections.
AB  == this paper reviews new information on antimicrobial agents for the treatment of obstetric-gynecologic infections. the bacteriology of these infections is complex, reflecting the bacteria that usually colonize the vagina and cervix. in  general, these infections are polymicrobial in nature: the most frequently isolated microorganisms are gram-negative facultative aerobes, anaerobes, chlamydia trachomatis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. antibiotic regimens that do provide coverage of these pathogens showed unacceptably high failure rates. a review of the studies recently published confirmed the recommendations of the us  centers for disease control and prevention for severe (inpatients) and mild-to-moderate (outpatients) pelvic inflammatory disease infections. in the case of severe infections, two regimens are recommended: a second-generation cephalosporin like cefoxitin or cefotetan, plus doxycycline or clindamycin/gentamicin. in the case of mild-to-moderate infection, a second- or third-generation cephalosporin plus doxycycline, or oral clindamycin plus an oral quinolone are recommended. such studies produce high bacteriologic and clinical success rates. new studies indicate that gentamicin may be replaced with a monobactam such as aztreonam; this regimen leads to slightly better efficacy and  less toxicity. the possibility of using clindamycin and a quinolone antibiotic is also discussed.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of ro 40-6890, ro 41-3399, and other antimicrobial  agents against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activity of the ester ro 41-3399 and its free active acid ro 40-6890 was tested against 189 strains of anaerobic bacteria in comparison to other oral  cephalosporins and to antimicrobial agents established in the treatment of anaerobic infections. prevotella, porphyromonas, peptostreptococcus, fusobacterium and clostridium spp. were susceptible to ro 40-6890, with few exceptions. due to its lack of activity against the major pathogens of the bacteriodes fragilis group, ro 40-6890 does not promise to be of major use in the treatment of infections caused by anaerobes.

TI  == effect of infection with eimeria tenella upon the cecal bacterial population in monoflora chickens.
AB  == monoflora chickens were established at 2 days of age by an oral inoculation with  one of six species of bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium thermophilum, bacteroides vulgatus, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, or streptococcus faecalis) and were infected with eimeria tenella (5 x 10(4) oocysts per bird) 2 days later. there were two experimental groups for each bacterium: birds infected with bacteria alone and birds infected with a combination of bacteria and e. tenella. seven days after e. tenella infection, counts of b. thermophilum in the cecal contents were significantly lower for e. tenella-infected birds than for those infected by b. thermophilum alone, whereas  10 days after e. tenella infection, counts were higher for e. tennella-infected birds. the population of l. acidophilus in the cecal contents of the e. tenella-infected chickens 10 days after inoculation was significantly greater than that in uninfected chickens. no significant differences were observed between the numbers of b. vulgatus, c. perfringens, and s. faecalis in cecal contents of groups with and without e. tenella infections.

TI  == anaerobic infections in childhood.
AB  == bacteroides melaninogenicus and bacteroides oralis are predominant anaerobes in orofacial infections and aspiration pneumonia. fusobacterium species are common pathogens in aspiration pneumonia, brain abscesses and orofacial infections. clostridium perfringens can cause bacteremia and wound infections. clostridium botulinum can produce a paralytic toxin that causes a paralytic syndrome in infants. clostridium difficile can cause diarrhea or antibiotic-associated colitis.

TI  == anaerobic infections in childhood.
AB  == anaerobic bacteria are part of the normal flora of mucous membranes and outnumber aerobic bacteria in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract. anaerobes can be  isolated from pediatric patients with various infections when appropriate techniques for transportation and cultivation of samples are employed. frequently anaerobes are isolated in combination with other facultative or aerobic bacteria. the genera or groups of anaerobes most frequently isolated from pyogenic infections in children are (in order of decreasing frequency) offteroides, clostridium, gram-positive cocci, fusobacterium, gram-positive rods (eubacterium, lactobacillus, propionibacterium, actinomyces, and bifidobacterium), and gram-negative cocci (veillonella and acidaminococcus). clostridium perfringens causes bacteremia and wound infections. clostridium botulinum can produce a paralytic toxin that causes a lethal illness in adults and a paralytic syndrome in infants. clostridium difficile can cause antibiotic-associated colitis or diarrhea. bacteroides fragilis is most frequently involved in intraabdominal infections, infections of the female genital tract, subcutaneous abscesses, and bacteremia. bacteroides melaninogenicus and bacteroides oralis are the predominent anaerobes in orofacial infections and aspiration pneumonia. fusobacterium species are pathogens in aspiration pneumonia, brain abscesses, and orofacial infections. anaerobic gram-positive cocci can be recovered from all types of infections but predominate in respiratory tract and intra-abdominal infections. recognition of the pathogenic qualities of the various anaerobic organisms can assist in their prompt identification and in the initiation of appropriate therapy.

TI  == comparative effects of oral administration of trimethoprim/sulphadiazine or oxytetracycline on the faecal flora of horses.
AB  == a study was carried out on the bacteriological faecal flora of horses before and  after oral doses of oxytetracycline or trimethoprim plus sulphadiazine. administration of oxytetracycline was rapidly followed by large increases in counts of coliforms. bacteroides and streptococcus species, the disappearance of  veillonella species, the appearance of clostridium perfringens type a in large numbers and the accumulation of watery fluid in the rectal contents. these changes were not seen following administration of trimethoprim-sulphadiazine and  it was concluded that oral treatment of horses with this combination was unlikely to be accompanied by the hazard of inducing colitis.
