TI  == a novel method for screening of potential probiotics for high adhesion capability.
AB  == to screen for potential probiotics with high adhesion capability, a chemostat model-based cultured human feces and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis methods were applied, and the adhesion capability of the isolates was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. lactobacillus plantarum (hm218749), lactobacillus reuteri (eu547310), and enterococcus faecalis (hm218543) were isolated from the slime on  the chemostat wall, as these organisms could grow better at 37 degrees c in an anaerobic environment and could resist harsh conditions (ph 1.5 and 0.30% bile salt). lactobacillus plantarum, l. reuteri, and e. faecalis could adhere to ht-29 cells and reduce the adhesion of shigella dysenteriae 2457, staphylococcus cowan1, enterobacter sakazakii 45401, and escherichia coli 44102 to ht-29 cells.  moreover, the animal experiment showed that l. plantarum could adhere to mice intestine, increasing the number of lactobacilli and decreasing the number of enterococci.

TI  == biodiversity and gamma-aminobutyric acid production by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional alpine raw cow's milk cheeses.
AB  == "nostrano-cheeses" are traditional alpine cheeses made from raw cow's milk in trentino-alto adige, italy. this study identified lactic acid bacteria (lab) developing during maturation of "nostrano-cheeses" and evaluated their potential  to produce gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba), an immunologically active compound and neurotransmitter. cheese samples were collected on six cheese-making days, in three dairy factories located in different areas of trentino and at different stages of cheese ripening (24 h, 15 days, and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 months). a total  of 1,059 lab isolates were screened using random amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and differentiated into 583 clusters. lab strains from dominant clusters (n = 97) were genetically identified to species level by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. lab species most frequently isolated were lactobacillus paracasei, streptococcus thermophilus, and leuconostoc mesenteroides. the 97 dominant clusters were also characterized for their ability in producing gaba by  high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). about 71% of the dominant bacteria clusters evolving during cheeses ripening were able to produce gaba. most gaba producers were lactobacillus paracasei but other gaba producing species included  lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, pediococcus pentosaceus, and streptococcus thermophilus. no enterococcus faecalis or sc. macedonicus isolates produced gaba. the isolate producing the highest amount of gaba (80.0+/-2.7 mg/kg) was a sc. thermophilus.

TI  == probiotic potential of lactobacillus strains isolated from sorghum-based traditional fermented food.
AB  == sorghum-based traditional fermented food was screened for potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria. the isolates were identified by biochemical, physiological  and genetic methods. species identification was done by 16s rrna sequence analysis. the functional probiotic potential of the two lactobacillus species viz., lactobacillus plantarum (lact. plantarum) and lactobacillus pentosus (lact. pentosus) was assessed by different standard parameters. the strains were tolerant to ph 2 for 1 h and resistant to methicillin, kanamycin, vancomycin and  norfloxacin. two (lact. plantarum coorg-3 and lact. pentosus coorg-8) out of eight isolates recorded the cell surface hydrophobicity to be 59.12 and 64.06 %,  respectively. all the strains showed tolerance to artificial duodenum juice (ph 2) for 3 h, positive for bile salt hydrolase test and negative for haemolytic test. the neutralized cell-free supernatant of the strains lact. pentosus coorg-4, lact. plantarum coorg-1, lact. plantarum coorg-7, lact. pentosus coorg-8 and lact. plantarum coorg-3 showed good antibiofilm activity. lact. pentosus coorg-8 exhibited 74 % activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa-mtcc 7903 and lact. plantarum coorg-7 showed 68 % inhibition of biofilm against klebsiella pneumonia mtcc 7407. three (lact. plantarum coorg-7, lact. pentosus coorg-5 and lact. pentosus coorg 8) out of eight isolates exhibited a good antimicrobial activity against listeria monocytogenes and five isolates (lact. pentosus coorg 2, lact. plantarum coorg 1, lact. plantarum coorg 4, lact. pentosus coorg 3 and lact. plantarum coorg 6) are active against escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumonia, enterococcus faecalis. the study also evaluated the cholesterol lowering property of the lactobacillus strains using hen egg yolk as the cholesterol source. the cholesterol in hen egg yolk was assimilated by 74.12 and 68.26 % by lact. plantarum coorg 4 and lact. pentosus coorg 7, respectively. the results of the present study suggest that the lactobacillus strains isolated and characterized from sorghum-based fermented product may be used as probiotic strains for therapeutic applications.

TI  == the use of the replication region of plasmid prs7 from oenococcus oeni as a putative tool to generate cloning vectors for lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == a chimeric plasmid, prs7rep (6.1 kb), was constructed using the replication region of prs7, a large plasmid from oenococcus oeni, and pem64, a plasmid derived from pij2925 and containing a gene for resistance to chloramphenicol. prs7rep is a shuttle vector that replicates in escherichia coli using its pij2925 component and in lactic acid bacteria (lab) using the replication region of prs7. high levels of transformants per microg of dna were obtained by electroporation of prs7rep into pediococcus acidilactici (1.5 x 10(7)), lactobacillus plantarum (5.7 x 10(5)), lactobacillus casei (2.3 x 10(5)), leuconostoc citreum (2.7 x 10(5)), and enterococcus faecalis (2.4 x 10(5)). a preliminary optimisation of the technical conditions of electrotransformation showed that p. acidilactici and l. plantarum are better transformed at a later exponential phase of growth, whereas l. casei requires the early exponential phase for better electrotransformation efficiency. prs7rep contains single restriction sites useful for cloning purposes, bamhi, xbai, sali, hincii, sphi and psti, and was maintained at an acceptable rate (>50%) over 100 generations without selective pressure in l. plantarum, but was less stable in l. casei and p. acidilactici. the ability of prs7rep to accept and express other genes was assessed. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the replication region of a plasmid from o. oeni has been used to generate a cloning vector.

TI  == impact of microbial cultures on proteolysis and release of bioactive peptides in  fermented milk.
AB  == this study aimed at evaluating co-cultures of selected microorganisms for their proteolytic activity and capability to produce fermented milk enriched with ace-inhibitory (acei) peptides. selected yeasts (torulaspora delbruekii kl66a, galactomyces geotrichum kl20b, pichia kudriavzevii kl84a and kluyveromyces marxianus kl26a) and lactic acid bacteria strains (lactobacillus plantarum lat03, lb. plantarum klat01 and the not virulent enterococcus faecalis ke06) were screened as single cultures for their capacity of releasing acei peptides without producing bitter taste. three strains cultures (yeast, lb. plantarum and e. faecalis) were performed to evaluate the combined impact on microbial growth, lactic acid production, citric acid consumption, proteolysis, acei activity, and  bitter taste after 36 h of fermentation at 28 degrees c. while g. geotrichum kl20b showed a strong stimulating effect on lb. plantarum strains and the production of peptides with acei activity, the presence of t. delbruekii kl26a in the cultures was deleterious both to acei activity and product taste. the most effective combination was p. kudriavzevii kl84a, lb. plantarum lat3, e. faecalis  kl06, which showed the highest acei activity (ic50 = 30.63 +/- 1.11 mug ml(-1)) and gave no bitter taste for 7 days at 6 degrees c. our results highlight the importance of choosing the strains combination carefully, to obtain a high yield  of acei activity without bitter taste.

TI  == human pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and viruses in drosophila: disease modeling, lessons, and shortcomings.
AB  == drosophila has been the invertebrate model organism of choice for the study of innate immune responses during the past few decades. many drosophila-microbe interaction studies have helped to define innate immunity pathways, and significant effort has been made lately to decipher mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis. here we catalog 68 bacterial, fungal, and viral species studied in  flies, 43 of which are relevant to human health. we discuss studies of human pathogens in flies revealing not only the elicitation and avoidance of immune response but also mechanisms of tolerance, host tissue homeostasis, regeneration, and predisposition to cancer. prominent among those is the emerging pattern of intestinal regeneration as a defense response induced by pathogenic and innocuous bacteria. immunopathology mechanisms and many microbial virulence factors have been elucidated, but their relevance to human health conventionally necessitates  validation in mammalian models of infection.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal travnik young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks over four seasons.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the composition of lactic acid bacteria  (lab) in autochthonous young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks produced in  the vlasic mountain region of central bosnia and herzegovina near the town of travnik over a four season period. these three products were made from cow's milk by a traditional method without the addition of a starter culture. preliminary characterization with phenotype-based assays and identification using rep-pcr with a (gtg)5 primer and 16s rdna sequence analysis were undertaken for 460 lab isolates obtained from all the examined samples. fifteen species were identified  as follows: lactococcus lactis, lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus garviae, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus helveticus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus italicus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus thermophilus and streptococcus mitis. a wide genotypic and  phenotypic heterogeneity of the species was observed, particularly within the lc. lactis strains. in all of the tested dairy products across four seasons, a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.690) between the presence of lactococci and enterococci and a negative correlation (r = 0.722) between the presence of lactococci and leuconostocs were recorded. forty-five percent of the lactobacilli and 54.4% of the lactococci exhibited proteolytic activity, whereas 18.7% of the  total lab isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity.

TI  == immunostimulatory cpg motifs in the genomes of gut bacteria and their role in human health and disease.
AB  == toll-like receptor (tlr) signalling plays an important role in epithelial and immune cells of the intestine. tlr9 recognizes unmethylated cpg motifs in bacterial dna, and tlr9 signalling maintains the gut epithelial homeostasis. here, we carried out a bioinformatic analysis of the frequency of cpg motifs in the genomes of gut commensal bacteria across major bacterial phyla. the frequency of potentially immunostimulatory cpg motifs (all cpg hexamers) or purine-purine-cg-pyrimidine-pyrimidine hexamers was linearly dependent on the genomic g+c content. we found that species belonging to proteobacteria, bacteroidetes and actinobacteria (including bifidobacteria) carried high counts of gtcgtt, the optimal motif stimulating human tlr9. we also found that enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus rhamnosus, whose strains have been marketed as probiotics, had high counts of gtcgtt motifs. as gut bacterial species differ significantly in their genomic content of cpg motifs, the overall load of cpg motifs in the intestine depends on the species assembly of microbiota and their cell numbers. the optimal cpg motif content of microbiota may depend on the host's physiological status and, consequently, on an adequate level of tlr9 signalling. we speculate that microbiota with increased numbers of microbes with cpg motif-rich dna could better support mucosal functions in healthy individuals and improve the t-helper  1 (th1)/th2 imbalance in allergic diseases. in autoimmune disorders, cpg motif-rich dna could, however, further increase the th1-type immune responsiveness. estimation of the load of microbe-associated molecular patterns,  including cpg motifs, in gut microbiota could shed new light on host-microbe interactions across a range of diseases.

TI  == lipoteichoic acid of streptococcus mutans interacts with toll-like receptor 2 through the lipid moiety for induction of inflammatory mediators in murine macrophages.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is a pathogenic gram-positive bacterium that is closely associated with dental caries and subsequent pulpal inflammation. although lipoteichoic acid (lta) is considered a major virulence factor of gram-positive bacteria, little is known about the innate immunity to s. mutans lta. in this study, we purified lta from s. mutans (sm.lta) through n-butanol extraction, hydrophobic interaction column chromatography, and ion-exchange column chromatography to investigate its immunological properties using murine macrophages. the sm.lta preparation had no detectable contamination with endotoxins, proteins, or nucleic acids. upon exposure to sm.lta, the murine macrophage cell-line raw 264.7 cells produced tnf-alpha and nitric oxide (no) in  a dose-dependent manner. sm.lta preferentially bound to and activated cho/cd14/tlr2 cells rather than cho/cd14/tlr4 cells, which are stable transfectants expressing cd14 and tlr2 or cd14 and tlr4, respectively. sm.lta could not induce tnf-alpha or no production in macrophages derived from tlr2-deficient mice whereas it dose-dependently induced those inflammatory mediators in wild-type macrophages. tlr2-dependent induction of no by sm.lta was  also confirmed in raw 264.7 cells using specific antibodies blocking tlr2. furthermore, sm.lta deacylated by alkaline hydrolysis neither stimulated tlr2 nor induced tnf-alpha or no production, suggesting that sm.lta lipid moieties are crucial for the immuno-stimulatory activity of sm.lta. unlike staphylococcus aureus lta, which has potent immuno-stimulating activity, sm.lta showed a modest  induction of no production comparable to ltas of other oral bacteria enterococcus faecalis and lactobacillus plantarum. in conclusion, our results suggest that the sm.lta interacts with tlr2 through the lipid moiety for the induction of inflammatory mediators in macrophages.

TI  == evaluation of lactic acid bacteria and yeast diversity in traditional white pickled and fresh soft cheeses from the mountain regions of serbia and lowland regions of croatia.
AB  == the goal of this study was the characterisation of indigenous lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeasts isolated from nine white pickled (bg) and nine fresh soft (zg) artisanal cheeses collected in serbia and croatia. while lab were present in all of the cheeses collected, yeasts were found in all bg cheeses but  only in three zg cheese samples. high lab and yeast species diversity was determined (average h'(l)=0.4 and h'(y)=0.8, respectively). the predominant lab species in white pickled (bg) cheeses were lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, and leuconostoc mesenteroides, while in fresh soft (zg) cheeses the most dominant lab species were l. lactis, enterococcus faecalis, and leuconostoc  pseudomesenteroides. among the 20 yeast species found, debaryomyces hansenii, candida zeylanoides, and torulaspora delbrueckii were found to be predominant in  bg cheeses, while yarrowia lipolytica was predominant in zg cheeses. the characterisation of metabolic and technological potentials revealed that 53.4% of lab isolates produced antimicrobial compounds, 44.3% of lab strains showed proteolytic activity, while most of the yeast species possessed either lipolytic  or proteolytic activity. in conclusion, the results obtained in this study showed that the composition of lab and yeast populations in white pickled and fresh soft cheeses is region specific. the knowledge gained in this study could eventually be used to select region specific lab and yeast strains for the production of white pickled and fresh soft artisanal cheeses with geographically specific origins under controlled conditions.

TI  == microbiological and fermentative properties of baker's yeast starter used in breadmaking.
AB  == this study assessed the levels of microbial contaminants in liquid, compressed and dry commercial baker's yeasts used as starters in breadmaking. eumycetes, enterobacteriaceae, total and fecal coliforms, bacillus spp., and lactic acid bacteria (lab), in particular enterococci, were quantified. results obtained in this study highlighted that baker's yeast could represent a potential vehicle of  spoilage and undesirable microorganisms into the baking environment, even if these do not influence the leavening activity in the dough, as ascertained by rheofermentometer analysis. different microbial groups, such as spore-forming bacteria and moulds, were found in baker's yeast starters. moreover, different species of lab, which are considered the main contaminants in large-scale yeast fermentations, were isolated and identified by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and 16s rdna sequencing. the most recurrent species were lactobacillus plantarum, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus durans, isolated from both compressed and dry starters, whereas strains belonging to leuconostoc and pediococcus genera were found only in dry ones. nested-polymerase chain reaction (nested-pcr) and randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) were  also used to highlight the biodiversity of the different commercial yeast strains, and to ascertain the culture purity.

TI  == organism-adapted specificity of the allosteric regulation of pyruvate kinase in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == pyruvate kinase (pyk) is a critical allosterically regulated enzyme that links glycolysis, the primary energy metabolism, to cellular metabolism. lactic acid bacteria rely almost exclusively on glycolysis for their energy production under  anaerobic conditions, which reinforces the key role of pyk in their metabolism. these organisms are closely related, but have adapted to a huge variety of native environments. they include food-fermenting organisms, important symbionts in the  human gut, and antibiotic-resistant pathogens. in contrast to the rather conserved inhibition of pyk by inorganic phosphate, the activation of pyk shows high variability in the type of activating compound between different lactic acid bacteria. system-wide comparative studies of the metabolism of lactic acid bacteria are required to understand the reasons for the diversity of these closely related microorganisms. these require knowledge of the identities of the  enzyme modifiers. here, we predict potential allosteric activators of pyks from three lactic acid bacteria which are adapted to different native environments. we used protein structure-based molecular modeling and enzyme kinetic modeling to predict and validate potential activators of pyk. specifically, we compared the electrostatic potential and the binding of phosphate moieties at the allosteric binding sites, and predicted potential allosteric activators by docking. we then  made a kinetic model of lactococcus lactis pyk to relate the activator predictions to the intracellular sugar-phosphate conditions in lactic acid bacteria. this strategy enabled us to predict fructose 1,6-bisphosphate as the sole activator of the enterococcus faecalis pyk, and to predict that the pyks from streptococcus pyogenes and lactobacillus plantarum show weaker specificity for their allosteric activators, while still having fructose 1,6-bisphosphate play the main activator role in vivo. these differences in the specificity of allosteric activation may reflect adaptation to different environments with different concentrations of activating compounds. the combined computational approach employed can readily be applied to other enzymes.

TI  == technological and safety properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from spanish dry-cured sausages.
AB  == technological and safety-related properties were analyzed in lactic acid bacteria isolated from spanish dry-cured sausages in order to select them as starter cultures. in relation to technological properties, all the strains showed significative nitrate reductase activity; lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus  paracasei and 52% of the enterococcus faecium strains showed lipolytic activity and only lactobacillus sakei strains (43%) were able to form biofilms. related to safety aspects, e. faecium strains were the most resistant to antibiotics, whereas, l. sakei strains were the most sensitive. in relation to virulence factors, in the e. faecium strains analyzed, only the presence of efaa gene was detected. the analysis of biogenic amine production showed that most e. faecium strains and l. sakei al-142 produced tyramine. in conclusion, l. paracasei al-128 and l. sakei al-143 strains possess the best properties to be selected as adequate and safe meat starter cultures.

TI  == regulation of the activity of lactate dehydrogenases from four lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == despite high similarity in sequence and catalytic properties, the l-lactate dehydrogenases (ldhs) in lactic acid bacteria (lab) display differences in their  regulation that may arise from their adaptation to different habitats. we combined experimental and computational approaches to investigate the effects of  fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (fbp), phosphate (pi), and ionic strength (nacl concentration) on six ldhs from four labs studied at ph 6 and ph 7. we found that 1) the extent of activation by fbp (kact) differs. lactobacillus plantarum ldh is not regulated by fbp, but the other ldhs are activated with increasing sensitivity in the following order: enterococcus faecalis ldh2 </= lactococcus lactis ldh2 < e. faecalis ldh1 < l. lactis ldh1 </= streptococcus pyogenes ldh. this trend reflects the electrostatic properties in the allosteric binding site of the ldh enzymes. 2) for l. plantarum, s. pyogenes, and e. faecalis, the effects of pi are distinguishable from the effect of changing ionic strength by adding nacl. 3) addition of pi inhibits e. faecalis ldh2, whereas in the absence  of fbp, pi is an activator of s. pyogenes ldh, e. faecalis ldh1, and l. lactis ldh1 and ldh2 at ph 6. these effects can be interpreted by considering the computed binding affinities of pi to the catalytic and allosteric binding sites of the enzymes modeled in protonation states corresponding to ph 6 and ph 7. overall, the results show a subtle interplay among the effects of pi, fbp, and ph that results in different regulatory effects on the ldhs of different labs.

TI  == behavior of escherichia coli o26:h11 in the presence of hafnia alvei in a model cheese ecosystem.
AB  == this study was designed to evaluate the capacity of three hafnia strains to inhibit the growth of an e. coli strain o26:h11 in an uncooked pressed model cheese, in the presence or absence of a microbial consortium added to mimic a cheese microbial community. inoculated at 2 log cfu/ml into pasteurized milk without hafnia, the e. coli o26:h11 strain reached 5 log cfu/g during cheese-making and survived at levels of 4 to 5 log cfu/g beyond 40 days. inoculated into milk at 6 log cfu/ml, all three tested hafnia strains (h. alvei b16 and ha, h. paralvei 920) reached values close to 8 log cfu/g and reduced e. coli o26:h11 counts in cheese on day 1 by 0.8 to 1.4 log cfu/g compared to cheeses inoculated with e. coli o26:h11 and the microbial consortium only. the hafnia strains slightly reduced counts of enterococcus faecalis (~-0.5 log from day 1) and promoted lactobacillus plantarum growth (+0.2 to 0.5 log from day 8) in cheese. they produced small amounts of putrescine (~1.3 mmol/kg) and cadaverine (~0.9 mmol/kg) in cheese after 28 days, and did not affect levels of volatile aroma compounds. further work on h. alvei strain b16 showed that e. coli o26:h11, inoculated at 2 log cfu/ml, was inhibited by h. alvei b16 inoculated at  6 log cfu/ml and not at 4.5 log cfu/ml. the inhibition was associated neither with lower ph values in cheese after 6 or 24h, nor with higher concentrations of  lactic acid. enhanced concentrations of acetic acid on day 1 in cheese inoculated with h. alvei b16 (4 to 11 mmol/kg) could not fully explain the reduction in e. coli o26:h11 growth. a synergistic interaction between h. alvei b16 and the microbial consortium, resulting in an additional 0.7-log reduction in e. coli o26:h11 counts, was observed from day 8 in model cheeses made from pasteurized milk. however, e. coli o26:h11 survived better during ripening in model cheeses made from raw milk than in those made from pasteurized milk, but this was not associated with an increase in ph values. in vitro approaches are required to investigate the mechanisms and causative agents of this interaction. h. alvei b16 appears to be a promising strain for reducing e. coli o26:h11 growth in cheese, as part of a multi-hurdle approach.

TI  == stimulation of cadaverine production by foodborne pathogens in the presence of lactobacillus, lactococcus, and streptococcus spp.
AB  == the effect of lactobacillus plantarum (fi8595), lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris mg 1363), lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (il 1403), and streptococcus  thermophilus on cadaverine and other biogenic amine production by foodborne pathogens was investigated lysine decarboxylase broth. both of lactic acid bacteria and foodborne pathogens used (especially staphylococcus aureus, e. coli, lc. lactis subsp. lactis and lb. plantarum) had an ability to convert aminoacids  into biogenic amine. the conversion of lysine into cadaverine was the highest (167.11 mg/l) by lactobacillus spp. gram-positive bacteria generally had a greater ability to produce cadaverine with corresponding value of 46.26, 53.76, and 154.54 mg/l for enterococcus faecalis, s. aureus, and listeria monocytogenes, respectively. significant variations on biogenic amine production were observed in the presence of lactic acid bacteria strains (p < 0.05). the role of lactic acid bacteria on biogenic amine production by foodborne pathogens varied depending on strains and specific amine. cadaverine accumulation by enterobactericeae was increased in the presence of lactic acid bacteria strains except for st. thermophilus, which induced 2-fold lower cadaverine production by  s. paratyphi a. lc. lactis subsp. lactis and lc. lactis subsp. cremoris induced 10-fold higher increases in histamine for e. coli and k. pneumoniae, respectively. lactic acid bacteria resulted in strong increases in cadaverine production by p. aeruginosa, although remarkable decreases were observed for histamine, spermidine, dopamine, agmatine, and tma in the presence of lactic acid bacteria in lysine decarboxylase broth . the result of the study showed that amine positive lactic acid bacteria strains in fermented food led to significant  amine accumulation by contaminant bacteria and their accumulation in food product may be controlled by the use of proper starters with amine-negative activity.

TI  == comparison of swab transport media for recovery of listeria monocytogenes from environmental samples.
AB  == environmental monitoring is recognized as an important strategy for controlling listeria monocytogenes in food processing facilities. samples are taken by swabbing environmental surfaces, and the swabs are immersed in a medium for transport to the laboratory. in this study, buffered peptone water (bpw), dey-engley neutralizing broth (de), neutralizing buffer (nb), letheen broth (le), and newly described mcc buffer (mcc) were evaluated as transport media for recovery of sanitizer-stressed l. monocytogenes from inoculated swabs. after storage at 4 degrees c, the media performed similarly, but at 25 degrees c relative recovery efficiency from the inoculated sponges was de > le > bpw > mcc  > nb. recoveries from stainless steel surfaces followed similar trends. mcc, de,  and nb were compared for l. monocytogenes recovery in the presence of escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus plantarum, pseudomonas fluorescens, and listeria innocua. after 4 degrees c storage, all population levels changed little; after 25 degrees c storage, de allowed the best growth of l. monocytogenes regardless of other species present. mcc, de, and nb performed similarly for recovery of l. monocytogenes from an artificial milk biofilm and for recovery of listeria spp. from swabs obtained from a meat processing facility. transport medium formulation, time and temperature of swab storage, and coexistence of other species affect recovery of sanitizer-stressed l. monocytogenes from environmental swabs. the study confirms the need to maintain 4 degrees c storage conditions during swab transport.

TI  == iron availability increases the pathogenic potential of salmonella typhimurium and other enteric pathogens at the intestinal epithelial interface.
AB  == recent trials have questioned the safety of untargeted oral iron supplementation  in developing regions. excess of luminal iron could select for enteric pathogens  at the expense of beneficial commensals in the human gut microflora, thereby increasing the incidence of infectious diseases. the objective of the current study was to determine the effect of high iron availability on virulence traits of prevalent enteric pathogens at the host-microbe interface. a panel of enteric  bacteria was cultured under iron-limiting conditions and in the presence of increasing concentrations of ferric citrate to assess the effect on bacterial growth, epithelial adhesion, invasion, translocation and epithelial damage in vitro. translocation and epithelial integrity experiments were performed using a  transwell system in which caco-2 cells were allowed to differentiate to a tight epithelial monolayer mimicking the intestinal epithelial barrier. growth of salmonella typhimurium and other enteric pathogens was increased in response to iron. adhesion of s. typhimurium to epithelial cells markedly increased when these bacteria were pre-incubated with increasing iron concentration (p = 0.0001), whereas this was not the case for the non-pathogenic lactobacillus plantarum (p = 0.42). cellular invasion and epithelial translocation of s. typhimurium followed the trend of increased adhesion. epithelial damage was increased upon incubation with s. typhimurium or citrobacter freundii that were pre-incubated under iron-rich conditions. in conclusion, our data fit with the consensus that oral iron supplementation is not without risk as iron could, in addition to inducing pathogenic overgrowth, also increase the virulence of prevalent enteric pathogens.

TI  == impact of gram-negative bacteria in interaction with a complex microbial consortium on biogenic amine content and sensory characteristics of an uncooked pressed cheese.
AB  == the impact of gram-negative bacteria on sensory characteristics and production of volatile compounds as well as biogenic amines (ba) in the core of an uncooked pressed type model cheese was investigated in the presence of a defined complex microbial consortium. eleven strains of gram-negative bacteria, selected on the basis of their biodiversity and in vitro ba-production ability, were individually tested in a model cheese. four out of 6 strains of enterobacteriaceae (citrobacter freundii ucma 4217, klebsiella oxytoca 927, hafnia alvei b16 and proteus vulgaris ucma 3780) reached counts close to 6 log cfu g(-)(1) in the model cheese. in core of cheeses inoculated with gram-negative bacteria, only slight differences were observed for microbial counts (enterococcus faecalis or lactobacillus plantarum count differences below 1 log cfu g(-)(1)), acetate concentration (differences below 200 mg kg(-)(1)) and texture (greater firmness)  in comparison to control cheeses. cheese core colour, odour and volatile compound composition were not modified. although ornithine, the precursor of putrescine, was present in all cheeses, putrescine was only detected in cheeses inoculated with h. alvei b16 and never exceeded 2.18 mmol kg(-)(1) cheese dry matter. cadaverine was only detected in cheeses inoculated with h. alvei b16, k. oxytoca  927, halomonas venusta 4c1a or morganella morganii 3a2a but at lower concentrations (<1.05 mmol kg(-)(1) cheese dry matter), although lysine was available. only insignificant amounts of the detrimental ba histamine and tyramine, as well as isopentylamine, tryptamine or phenylethylamine, were produced in the cheese model by any of the gram-negative strains, including those which produced these ba at high levels in vitro.

AB  == detecting bacteria in clinical samples without using time-consuming culture processes would allow rapid diagnoses. such a culture-free detection method requires the capture and analysis of bacteria from a body fluid, which are usually of complicated composition. here we show that coating ag-nanoparticle arrays with vancomycin (van) can provide label-free analysis of bacteria via surface-enhanced raman spectroscopy (sers), leading to a ~1,000-fold increase in  bacteria capture, without introducing significant spectral interference. bacteria from human blood can be concentrated onto a microscopic van-coated area while blood cells are excluded. furthermore, a van-coated substrate provides distinctly different sers spectra of van-susceptible and van-resistant enterococcus, indicating its potential use for drug-resistance tests. our results represent a critical step towards the creation of sers-based multifunctional biochips for rapid culture- and label-free detection and drug-resistant testing of microorganisms in clinical samples.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria isolated from sour congee in inner mongolia of china.
AB  == sour congee is a popular food in the western regions of inner mongolia in china.  it has a complex microbial population, which contributes to its unique flavor and functional properties. in this study, we chose 28 sour congee samples that were collected from different areas in inner mongolia for analysis of the microbial community of lactic acid bacteria (lab) by classical biochemical tests, 16s rrna  gene sequencing, multiplex pcr assay of reca gene and restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis of the tuf gene (encoding elongation factor tu). the results revealed that all the isolates were identified as lactobacillus (l.) paracasei (38 strains), l. fermentum (28 strains), l. plantarum (7 strains), l. brevis (4 strains), l. reuteri (2 strains), l. amylolyticus (1 strain), enterococcus (e.) faecalis (3 strains), e. italicus (2 strains) or lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (1 strain). the predominant lab were l. casei and l. fermentum in sour congee samples. the diversity of lab derived from sour congee could offer useful information for further research on sour congee, and the results demonstrated that the combination of tuf gene and rflp patterns can be considered as a useful tool for differentiation of the l. casei group.

TI  == antagonistic effect of lactobacillus strains against gas-producing coliforms isolated from colicky infants.
AB  == background: infantile colic is a common disturb within the first 3 months of life, nevertheless the pathogenesis is incompletely understood and treatment remains an open issue. intestinal gas production is thought to be one of the causes of abdominal discomfort in infants suffering from colic. however, data about the role of the amount of gas produced by infants' colonic microbiota and the correlation with the onset of colic symptoms are scanty. the benefit of supplementation with lactobacilli been recently reported but the mechanisms by which they exert their effects have not yet been fully defined. this study was performed to evaluate the interaction between lactobacillus spp. strains and gas-forming coliforms isolated from stools of colicky infants. results: strains of coliforms were isolated from stools of 45 colicky and 42 control breastfed infants in mcconkey agar and identified using pcr with species-specific primers,  and the bbl enterotube ii system for enterobacteriaceae. gas-forming capability of coliforms was assessed in liquid cultures containing lactose as sole carbon source. the average count of total coliforms in colicky infants was significantly higher than controls: 5.98 (2.00-8.76) log10 vs 3.90 (2.50-7.10) cfu/g of faeces  (p = 0.015). the following strains were identified: escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and  enterococcus faecalis. then, 27 lactobacillus strains were tested for their antagonistic effect against coliforms both by halo-forming method and in liquid co-cultures. lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii dsm 20074 and l. plantarum mb 456 were able to inhibit all coliforms strains (halo-forming method), also in liquid co-cultures, thus demonstrating an antagonistic activity. conclusions: this study shows that two out of 27 strains of lactobacillus examined possess an antimicrobial effect against six species of gas-forming coliforms isolated from colicky infants. our findings may stimulate new researches to identify which lactobacillus strains can improve colicky symptoms by acting on coliforms gut colonization.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from italian bella di cerignola table olives: selection of potential multifunctional starter cultures.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (19 isolates) from bella di cerignola italian table olives were investigated for their technological and probiotic properties for the selection of multifunctional starter cultures for table olives. the bacteria were first identified by phenotyping and genotyping, then characterized for the production of biogenic amines, growth at different ph, nacl concentrations, and temperatures. the potentiality of the bacteria to have some probiotic properties  (antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens, survival in low ph and in the presence of bile salts, ability to adhere to the mammalian cells model ipec-j2) was also investigated. eighteen of the studied isolates were identified  as lactobacillus plantarum and one as enterococcus faecalis. all bacteria were able to grow at a range of ph between 4.0 and 10.0 as well as in media supplemented with 2.5 to 7.5% of nacl and 0.3% bile salts and survived in mrs broth acidified at ph 2.5; moreover, they inhibited significantly escherichia coli o157:h7. the adhesion to ipec-j2 cells was in general low to moderate (5.3 to 8.3%); however, 2 isolates of l. plantarum (c16 and c19) showed interesting higher adhesion values (up to 16%). our results suggest that at least 3 isolates  could be possible multifunctional starters for bella di cerignola olives: l. plantarum 16 and 19 for mainly their probiotic properties and l. plantarum 10 for mainly its technological characteristics. practical application: a functional starter is a microorganism exerting benefits on human health (probiotic) and able to guide a fermentation (starter). the main goal of this article was to select a  functional starter for table olives.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic analyses of lactic acid bacteria in local fermented food, breast milk and faeces of mothers and their babies.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are generally accepted as beneficial to the host and their presence is directly influenced by ingestion of fermented food or probiotics. while the intestinal lactic microbiota is well-described knowledge on its routes of inoculation and competitiveness towards selective pressure shaping  the intestinal microbiota is limited. in this study, lab were isolated from faecal samples of breast feeding mothers living in syria, from faeces of their infants, from breast milk as well as from fermented food, typically consumed in syria. a total of 700 isolates were characterized by genetic fingerprinting with  random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) and identified by comparative 16s rdna sequencing and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) analyses. thirty six different species of lactobacillus, enterococcus, streptococcus, weissella and pediococcus were identified. rapd and maldi-tof-ms patterns allowed comparison of the lactic microbiota on species and strain level. whereas some species were unique for one  source, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus brevis were found in all sources. interestingly, identical rapd genotypes of l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis and p. pentosaceus were found in the faeces of mothers, her milk and in faeces of her babies. diversity of rapd types found in food versus human samples suggests the importance of host factors in colonization and individual host specificity, and support the hypothesis that there is a vertical  transfer of intestinal lab from the mother's gut to her milk and through the milk to the infant's gut.

TI  == diversity and dynamics of bacterial populations during spontaneous sorghum fermentations used to produce ting, a south african food.
AB  == ting is a spontaneously fermented sorghum food that is popular for its sour taste and unique flavour. insight of the microbial diversity and population dynamics during sorghum fermentations is an essential component of the development of starter cultures for commercial production of ting. in this study, bacterial populations associated with spontaneous sorghum fermentations were examined using a culture-independent strategy based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequence analysis of v3-16s rrna gene amplicons, and a culture-dependent strategy using conventional isolation based on culturing followed by 16s rrna and/or phes gene sequence analysis. the entire fermentation process was monitored over a 54 h period and two phases were observed with respect to ph evolution and  microbial succession. the first phase of the process (0-6h) was characterized by  relatively high ph conditions and the presence of enterococcus mundtii, albeit that this species was only detected with the culture-dependent approach. the second phase of the fermentation process (12-54 h) was characterized by increased acidity and the predominance of a broader range of lactic acid bacteria, including lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, weissella cibaria, enterococcus faecalis, and a close relative of lactobacillus curvatus, as well as some members of the enterobacteriaceae family. the lb. curvatus-like species was only detected with pcr-dgge, while the majority of the other species was only detected using the culture-dependent approach. these findings highlighted the fact that a combination of both approaches was essential in revealing the microbial diversity and dynamics during spontaneous sorghum fermentations.

TI  == characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  == the study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (lab) from fermented foods in xi'an, china. lab strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of lactobacillus (n = 73), and streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16s rrna gene. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and s. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of lactobacillus. the erm(b) gene was detected from two strains of each of l. fermentum and l. vaginalis, and one strain of each of l. plantarum, l. salivarius, l. acidophilus, l. animalis, and s. thermophilus. the tet genes were  identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. this is the first time, the authors identified tet(s) gene from l. brevis and l. kefiri. the  erm(b) gene from l. fermentum nwl24 and l. salivarius nwl33, and tet(m) gene from l. plantarum nwl22 and l. brevis nwl59 were successfully transferred to enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. it was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in xi'an, china and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.

TI  == changes in the microbial composition of raw milk induced by thermization treatments applied prior to traditional greek hard cheese processing.
AB  == the microbiological quality, safety, and composition of mixtures of ewe's and goat's milk (90:10) used for cheesemaking were evaluated before and after thermization at 60 and 67 degrees c for 30 s. such mild thermal treatments are commonly applied to reduce natural contaminants of raw milk before processing for traditional hard greek cheeses. raw milk samples had an average total bacterial count of 7.3 log cfu/ml; most of these bacteria were lactic acid bacteria (lab) and pseudomonads. the lab flora of raw milk was dominated by enterococci (40.8%), followed by lactococci (20.4%), leuconostocs (18.4%), and mesophilic lactobacilli (10.2%). enterococcus faecalis (30.1%) and enterococcus faecium (13.7%) were the  most common lab isolates, followed by enterococcus durans, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, and leuconostoc lactis. thermization at 60 degrees c for 30 s was effective for reducing raw milk contamination by enterobacteria (5.1 log cfu/ml), coagulase-positive staphylococci (3.3 log cfu/ml), and listeria (present in 25-ml samples) to safe levels, but it also reduced mesophilic lactococci, leuconostocs, lactobacilli, and selected enterococci (72.0%) in thermized milk. thermization at 67 degrees c for 30 s had  a major inactivation effect on all bacterial groups. two nisin-producing l. lactis subsp. lactis strains (m78 and m104) were isolated from raw milk, but neither nisin-producing nor other bacteriocin-producing lab strains were isolated from thermized milk. thus, thermization treatments control harmful bacteria but also may have a negative impact on milk quality by reducing desirable lab and the biodiversity of raw milk bacteria overall, inactivating potentially protective lab strains and enhancing the ability of potentially pathogenic enterococci to grow in fresh cheese curds.

AB  == this paper reports the complete 4031 bp nucleotide sequence of the small erythromycin resistance plasmid plfe1 isolated from the raw-milk cheese isolate lactobacillus plantarum m345. analysis of the sequence revealed the coding regions for the erythromycin resistance determinant erm(b). a replication initiation protein repb was identified belonging to the repb proteins of the pmv158 family of rolling-circle replicating plasmids. the transcriptional repressor protein copg and a small counter transcribed rna, two elements typically involved in replication control within this family were also found. a putative replication initiation site including a single-strand origin (sso) -like region succeeded by a characteristic pmv158 family double-strand origin (dso) was located upstream of the replication region. an open reading frame following a typical origin of transfer (orit) site and coding for a putative truncated mobilization (mob) protein with a size of 83 aa was detected. the product of the  putative mob gene showed large similarity to the n-terminal region of the pmv158  family of pre/mob proteins, but was much smaller than other proteins of this family. we therefore suggest that the mob function in plfe1 is supplied in trans  from another plasmid present in l. plantarum m345.filter-mating experiments showed that plfe1 has a broad host-range with transconjugants obtained from lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, listeria innocua, the opportunistic  pathogen enterococcus faecalis and the pathogen listeria monocytogenes.

TI  == characterization of the beneficial properties of lactobacilli isolated from bullfrog (rana catesbeiana) hatchery.
AB  == the present work addresses the isolation and partial identification of the microbial population of a r. catesbeiana hatchery in spring and summer as well as some beneficial properties of lactobacillus strains isolated in different seasons and hatchery areas. the bacterial population was grouped into the following taxa: lactobacillus spp., pediococcus spp., enterococcus faecalis and ent. faecium, and enterobacteriaceae (enterobacter spp., escherichia coli) while pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis were isolated from frogs displaying red-leg syndrome. the lactobacillus plantarum and l. curvatus strains isolated showed to inhibit the growth of red-leg syndrome associated pathogens and food-borne bacteria by organic acids. while l. plantarum crl 1606 also inhibited  red-leg syndrome related pathogens by hydrogen peroxide, meat spoilage bacteria were only inhibited by acidity. however, by using a mrs medium added with tetramethyl-benzidine and peroxidase, a high percentage of h(2)o(2)-producing lactobacilli were detected. the surface properties of lactobacillus strains showed that a few strains were able to agglutinate abo human erythrocytes, while  the highest number of strains had a low to medium degree of hydrophobicity. this  paper constitute the first study related to the beneficial properties of lactobacillus isolated from a bullfrog hatchery, as well as the selection criteria applied to a group of strains, which could help to control or prevent bacterial infectious diseases in raniculture.

TI  == effect of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria starters on health-promoting and sensory properties of tomato juices.
AB  == strains of lactobacillus plantarum, weissella cibaria/confusa, lactobacillus brevis, pediococcus pentosaceous, lactobacillus sp. and enterococcus faecium/faecalis were identified from raw tomatoes by biolog system, partial 16s  rrna gene sequence and subjected to typing by random amplified polymorphic dna-polymerase chain reaction (rapd-pcr) analysis. ten autochthonous strains were singly used to ferment tomato juice (tj) via a protocol which included fermentation at 25 degrees c for 17 h and further storage at 4 degrees c for 40 days. unstarted tj and tj fermented with an allochthonous strain of l. plantarum  were used as the controls. all autochthonous strains grew well in tj reaching cell densities ca. 10,000 and 10 times higher than unstarted tj and tj fermented  with the allochthonous strain. viscosity of tjs fermented with autochthonous strains was generally the highest, especially when started with w. cibaria/confusa which synthesized exo-polysaccharides. overall, unstarted tj and  tj fermented with the allochthonous strain showed marked decreases of ascorbic acid (asc), glutathione (gsh) and total antioxidant activity (tta) during storage. on the contrary, several tjs fermented with autochthonous strains, especially with l. plantarum pom1 and pom 35, maintained elevated values of asc,  gsh and taa. the variation of color indexes mirrored the above behavior. tjs fermented with the above two autochthonous strains were compared to controls based on volatile components through purge and trap or solid phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (pt or spme-gc/ms) analysis. as shown by principal component analysis a large number of volatiles belonging to various chemical classes markedly differentiated tjs fermented with autochthonous strains with respect to controls.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria in two flemish artisan raw milk gouda-type cheeses.
AB  == pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) was used to study the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in two flemish artisan raw milk gouda-type cheeses. in parallel, conventional culturing was performed. isolates were identified using (gtg)(5)-pcr and sequence analysis of 16s rrna and phes genes. discriminant analysis revealed some differences in overall lab diversity between the two batches and between the two cheeses. within each batch, the diversity of 8- and 12-week-old cheeses was relatively similar. conventional isolation mainly revealed the presence of lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus  plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus rhamnosus and pediococcus pentosaceus. pcr-dgge revealed the presence of three species of which no isolates were recovered, i.e. enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus parabuchneri and lactobacillus gallinarum. conversely, not all isolated bacteria were detected by  pcr-dgge. we recommend the integrated use of culture-dependent and -independent approaches to maximally encompass the taxonomic spectrum of lab occurring in gouda-type and other cheeses.

TI  == bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus strains isolated from poto poto, a congolese  fermented maize product, and genetic fingerprinting of their plantaricin operons.
AB  == thirty one bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus isolates were identified among 135 lactobacilli isolated from the congolese fermented maize product poto poto, during the preparation and from the finished product. using species-specific pcr  and 16s rrna gene sequencing, 28 and 3 isolates were identified as l. plantarum and l. fermentum, respectively. cluster analysis of rapd-pcr fingerprints revealed two main groups (g1 and g2) plus the l. fermentum isolate c4-13. group g1 contained 23 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 74.5%, and could be divided in two subgroups (g1-1, g1-2) each with several branches, plus the l. plantarum isolate c11. group g2 contained 8 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 86%, with two main branches. using pcr amplification with specific  primers, several genes of the plantaricin cluster found in l. plantarum c11 were  identified in the isolates. the number of genes that were detected varied between the strains. the l. fermentum isolate ec11 also contained the plndefg genes. pcr  amplification of dna from isolates with primers directed to the upstream and downstream region of the plantaricin cluster generated an amplicon identical to that obtained with dna from the control strain l. plantarum wcfs1. amplification  products from the positive strains were used for restriction analysis with hindiii, ecori and kpni in separate reactions. cluster analysis of restriction profiles revealed high similarities for ecori and hindii digest profiles, and an  identical profile for all kpni digests. the l. fermentum ec11 isolate clustered with l. plantarum strains in a group with a high correlation coefficient. the results suggest a low degree of diversity in the plantarincin gene cluster. however, other strains that tested positive for individual plantaricin genes may  present great heterogeneity in the plantaricin operons. because of their broad spectra of inhibition (including escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, enterobacter aerogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and enterococcus faecalis), isolates from the present study could  be used to improve the safety and storage stability of poto poto.

TI  == selective pressure affects transfer and establishment of a lactobacillus plantarum resistance plasmid in the gastrointestinal environment.
AB  == objectives and methods: a lactobacillus plantarum strain recently isolated from french raw-milk cheese was tested for its ability to transfer a small plasmid plfe1 harbouring the erythromycin resistance gene erm(b) to enterococcus faecalis. mating was studied in vitro and in different gastrointestinal environments using gnotobiotic rats as a simple in vivo model and streptomycin-treated mice as a more complex model. transfer and establishment of  transconjugants in the intestine were investigated with and without selective pressure. results: compared with the relatively low transfer frequency of approximately 5.7 x 10(-8) transconjugants/recipient obtained in vitro by filter  mating, a surprisingly high number of transconjugants (10(-4) transconjugants/recipient) was observed in gnotobiotic rats even without antibiotic treatment. when erythromycin was administered, a transfer rate of approximately 100% was observed, i.e. the recipient population turned completely  into transconjugants (3 x 10(9) cfu/g faeces). additionally, the time to reach a  stable transconjugant population level was much faster in the erythromycin-treated gnotobiotic rats (1 day) than in the untreated animals (4-5  days). transconjugants persisted in the gut in relatively stable numbers at least 12 days after termination of antibiotic treatment. in the streptomycin-treated mice, no transfer was observed either with or without erythromycin treatment. conclusions: the overall results imply that the gastrointestinal tract may comprise a more favourable environment for antibiotic resistance transfer than conditions provided in vitro. however, the indigenous gut microbiota severely restricts transfer, thus minimizing the number of detectable transfer events. treatment with erythromycin strongly favoured transfer and establishment of plfe1.

AB  == aims: to identify, using phenotypic and genotypic methods, the dominant lactic acid bacteria (lab) present in sao jorge cheese - one of the 11 portuguese cheeses currently bearing an appellation d'origine protegee status. methods and results: a total of 225 isolates from milk, curd and cheeses throughout ripening  were identified to the genus level, 108 to the species level and ten to the strain level. phenotypic methods indicated that lactobacilli, followed by enterococci, were the dominant bacteria. the most frequently isolated species were lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, enterococcus faecalis and  enterococcus faecium. ribotyping differentiated three l. paracasei, two e. faecalis and one lactobacillus plantarum types. enterococcus spp. exhibited the highest esterase and beta-galactosidase activities among all isolates. conclusions: the dominant lab in sao jorge cheese are l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, e. faecalis and e. faecium. enterococcus likely plays a leading role upon acidification and aroma development in said cheese. significance and impact of the study: our results support that a combination of conventional biochemical methods with genotypic methods allows for a thorough characterization and identification of isolates. despite the limited number of isolates subject to molecular subtyping, a few specific enterococcus and lactobacillus strains were found that are promising ones for development of a starter culture. hence, l. paracasei and e. faecalis are good candidates for a tentative starter culture, designed for manufacturing of sao jorge cheese at large - which takes advantage of actual isolates, in attempts to eventually standardize the quality of said cheese variety.

TI  == new signaling molecules in some gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == a new family of putative signaling molecules having a 2(5h)-furanone configuration has been described in this work. they were released during late exponential or stationary phase in different growth media by some gram-positive bacteria, such as lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paraplantarum, lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, enterococcus faecalis, and a gram-negative species, i.e. salmonella enterica. a pair of 2(5h)-furanones called furanones a and b occurred in all the conditioned media (cms) of the species considered. these two molecules showed similar retention times and their spectral data shared the key fragments to include them in the 2(5h)-furanones family. however, some differences were observed in the mass fragmentation profiles. in particular the use of pca analysis of all the mass fragments enabled the grouping of furanone a profiles of s. enterica, l. helveticus, l. plantarum, l. paraplantarum, l. sanfranciscensis and e. faecalis in one unique cluster with only few exceptions. on the other hand, the mass fragmentation profiles of furanone b of the major part of the species and strains could be grouped together and were differentiated from those of l. helveticus. the specific activity of cell-free supernatants of high density cultures of s. enterica confirmed that the release of active molecules, and specifically of furanones a and b, was cell density dependent. moreover, a preliminary experiment suspending s. enterica cells into cell-free supernatants of l. helveticus previously exposed to an oxidative stress demonstrated that furanones a and b have a strong interspecific activity. in fact cell autolysis and cell envelope damages were observed with scanning electron microscopy (sem) in s. enterica.

AB  == the genus lactobacillus contains over 80 recognized species, and is characterized by a high level of diversity, reflected in its complex phylogeny. the authors' recent determination of the genome sequence of lactobacillus salivarius means that five complete genomes of lactobacillus species are available for comparative genomics: l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. johnsonii and l. sakei. this paper now shows that there is no extensive synteny of the genome sequences of these five lactobacilli. phylogeny based on whole-genome alignments suggested  that l. salivarius was closer to l. plantarum than to l. sakei, which was closest to enterococcus faecalis, in contrast to 16s rrna gene relatedness. a total of 593 orthologues common to all five species were identified. species relatedness based on this protein set was largely concordant with genome synteny-based relatedness. a lactobacillus supertree, combining individual phylogenetic trees from each of 354 core proteins, had four main branches, comprising l. salivarius-l. plantarum; l. sakei; e. faecalis; and l. acidophilus-l. johnsonii.  the extreme divergence of the lactobacillus genomes analysed supports the recognition of new subgeneric divisions.

TI  == horizontal transfer of tet(m) and erm(b) resistance plasmids from food strains of lactobacillus plantarum to enterococcus faecalis jh2-2 in the gastrointestinal tract of gnotobiotic rats.
AB  == two wild-type strains of lactobacillus plantarum previously isolated from fermented dry sausages were analysed for their ability to transfer antibiotic resistance plasmids in the gastrointestinal tract. for this purpose, we used gnotobiotic rats as an in vivo model. rats were initially inoculated with the recipient enterococcus faecalis jh2-2 at a concentration of 10(10) cfu ml(-1). after a week, either of the two donors l. plantarum dg 522 (harbouring a tet(m)-containing plasmid of c. 40 kb) or l. plantarum dg 507 [harbouring a tet(m)-containing plasmid of c. 10 kb and an erm(b)-containing plasmid of c. 8.5  kb] was introduced at concentrations in the range of 10(8)-10(10) cfu ml(-1). two days after donor introduction, the first transconjugants (tcs) were detected in faecal samples. the detected numbers of tet(m)-tcs were comparable for the two donors. in both cases, this number increased to c. 5 x 10(2) cfu g(-1) faeces towards the end of the experiment. for erm(b)-tcs, the number was significantly higher and increased to c. 10(3) cfu g(-1) faeces. to our knowledge, this is the  first study showing in vivo transfer of wild-type antibiotic resistance plasmids  from l. plantarum to e. faecalis.

TI  == isolation of bacteriocinogenic lactobacillus plantarum strains from ben saalga, a traditional fermented gruel from burkina faso.
AB  == a collection of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ben saalga, a traditional fermented gruel from burkina faso, was screened for bacteriocin production. seven isolates were selected for their broad antimicrobial spectra, which overall included strains of bacillus cereus, bacillus licheniformis, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and salmonella enterica. cluster analysis of rapd-pcr patterns revealed that six of the isolates represent different strains. the six selected strains were identified as lactobacillus plantarum by 16s rdna sequencing, species-specific pcr and multiplex pcr of the reca gene. pcr amplification revealed the presence of genes of the plantaricin cluster described in l. plantarum c11. among them, strain 5.2.2 carried the largest number of genes from  this cluster.

TI  == [study of some properties of strain lactobacillus plantarum g3/3(13) antagonistic factor].
AB  == the screening of strains which expressed antagonistic activity, that is not connected with lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide synthesis was conducted among 72 cultures of lactic acid bacteria. the strain l. plantarum g3/3(13) which inhibited growth of 11 test-cultures including lactobacillus plantarum, enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium was selected. the antibacterial factor was of protein nature, did not retain the activity after boiling and was active at ph 2.0-8.0, whereas at ph 9.0 its activity fell significantly. the obtained results  allow to assume that the formed agent can be bacteriocin-like substance and the strain l. plantarum g3/3(13) may be useful for food industry or probiotic construction.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == adhesion of lactobacillus plantarum 423 and lactobacillus salivarius 241 to the intestinal tract of piglets, as recorded with fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish), and production of plantaricin 423 by cells colonized to the ileum.
AB  == aims: to determine which intestinal section of pre and postweaned piglets are colonized by lactobacillus plantarum 423 and lactobacillus salivarius 241, and follow production of plantaricin 423 in a gastro-intestinal model. methods and results: lactobacillus plantarum 423 and lact. salivarius 241, single or in combination, were administered to 1-, 14- and 28-day-old (postweaned) piglets. according to results obtained by fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish), lact.  plantarum 423 adhered strongly to the ileum and posterior colon and lact. salivarius 241 to the duodenum in preweaned piglets. high numbers of strain 241 were recorded in the duodenum and posterior colon of postweaned piglets, whereas  strain 423 remained localized to the ileum. lowering in enterococcus faecalis cell numbers were recorded when preweaned piglets were challenged with strain 241. plantaricin 423 was produced for 96 h in the ileum section of a gastro-intestinal model. conclusions: lactobacillus plantarum 423 and lact. salivarius 241 adhere to different sections of the intestinal tract, depending on the piglet's age. ent. faecalis were inhibited in vivo, probably by plantaricin 423. significance and impact of the study: fluorescent in situ hybridization proved valuable in the detection of probiotic bacteria adhered to the intestine.  this is the first report of bacteriocin production in a model simulating the porcine gastro-intestinal tract.

TI  == characterization of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from spoiled black olives.
AB  == bacteriocin-producing strains of lactobacillus plantarum st23ld and st341ld, enterococcus faecium st311ld and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides st33ld were isolated from the brine of spoiled black olives. the bacteriocins produced by all four strains inhibited the growth of gram-positive bacteria (e. faecalis, l. casei and streptococcus pneumoniae), but also escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. strain st23ld produced two bacteriocins (st23lda and st23ldb of approximately 3.0 and 14.0 kda, respectively), with a combined maximum level of activity of 25,600 au/ml after 18 h of growth. the same level of activity was recorded for bacteriocin st341ld (approximately 3.0 kda), but after  16 h. bacteriocins st311ld (ca. 2.3 kda) and st33ld (ca. 2.7 kda) were produced at much lower levels (6400 au/ml), and only after 20 h of growth. bacteriocin activity was destroyed after treatment with proteolytic enzymes and triton x, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta, or when heated for 20 min at 121 degrees c. addition of bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st311ld to cells of lactobacillus casei lhs in logarithmic phase resulted in  growth inhibition for one hour, followed by a slight increase in optical density  over the next seven hours. bacteriocin st33ld also inhibited the growth of strain lhs, but to a lesser extent. bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st33ld remained at  the same level of activity for 6 h at ph<4.0. however, the activity of bacteriocin st311ld decreased by 50% within 2 h at ph 4.4. the possibility of the bacteriocin adsorbing to the producer cell and proteolytic degradation is unlikely.

TI  == rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by m13-generated, rapd-pcr fingerprint databases.
AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

AB  == the cell-free supernatant containing bacteriocin st13br, produced by lactobacillus plantarum st13br, inhibits the growth of l. casei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli. based on tricine-sds-page, bacteriocin st13br is 10 kda in size. complete inactivation or significant reduction in bacteriocin activity was observed after  treatment with proteinase k, trypsin and pronase, but not with catalase or alpha-amylase. low bacteriocin activity (200 au/ml) was recorded in bhi medium, m17 broth, 10% (w/v) soy milk, and 2% and 10% (w/v) molasses, despite good growth. maximal bacteriocin activity (6,400 au/ml) was recorded after 23 h in mrs broth, but only at 30 degrees c. tween 80 in mrs broth increased bacteriocin production by more than 50%. meat extract or yeast extract as sole nitrogen source, or a combination of the two (1 : 1) in mrs broth, stimulated bacteriocin  production (6,400 au/ml). only 50% activity (3,200 au/ml) was recorded with tryptone as sole nitrogen source, whereas a combination of tryptone, meat extract and yeast extract yielded 6,400 au/ml. bacteriocin production was not stimulated  by the addition of glucose at 2.0% w/v (3,200 au/ml), nor 2% (w/v) fructose, sucrose, lactose or mannose, respectively (800 au/ml). activity levels less than  200 au/ml were recorded in the presence of 0.05% to 0.5% (w/v) maltose. maximal bacteriocin production (6,400 au/ml) was recorded in the presence of 2% (w/v) maltose. maltose at 4.0% (w/v) led to a 50% reduction of bacteriocin activity. the presence of 1.0% (w/v) and higher kh(2)po(4), or glycerol at 0.2% (w/v) suppressed bacteriocin production.

TI  == detection of low levels of listeria monocytogenes cells by using a fiber-optic immunosensor.
AB  == biosensor technology has a great potential to meet the need for sensitive and nearly real-time microbial detection from foods. an antibody-based fiber-optic biosensor to detect low levels of listeria monocytogenes cells following an enrichment step was developed. the principle of the sensor is a sandwich immunoassay where a rabbit polyclonal antibody was first immobilized on polystyrene fiber waveguides through a biotin-streptavidin reaction to capture listeria cells on the fiber. capture of cells on the fibers was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. a cyanine 5-labeled murine monoclonal antibody, c11e9, was used to generate a specific fluorescent signal, which was acquired by  launching a 635-nm laser light from an analyte 2000 and collected by a photodetector at 670 to 710 nm. this immunosensor was specific for l. monocytogenes and showed a significantly higher signal strength than for other listeria species or other microorganisms, including escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella enterica, lactobacillus plantarum, carnobacterium gallinarum, hafnia alvei, corynebacterium glutamicum, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens, in pure or in mixed-culture setup. fiber-optic results could be obtained within 2.5 h of sampling. the sensitivity threshold was about 4.3 x 10(3) cfu/ml for a pure culture of l. monocytogenes grown at 37 degrees c. when l. monocytogenes was mixed with lactic acid bacteria or grown at 10 degrees c with 3.5% nacl, the detection threshold was 4.1 x 10(4) or 2.8 x 10(7) cfu/ml, respectively. in less  than 24 h, this method could detect l. monocytogenes in hot dog or bologna naturally contaminated or artificially inoculated with 10 to 1,000 cfu/g after enrichment in buffered listeria enrichment broth.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from aoc salers cheese.
AB  == the objective of this work was to describe the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  in traditional raw milk salers cheeses at the species and strain levels. the characterization of 381 strains isolated during ripening and various strain collections was investigated using physiological analysis and molecular techniques: rep-pcr, species and genus specific amplifications and the sequence analysis of 16s rdna for strain typing and taxonomic identification. the strains  belonged to lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garviae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus millieri, streptococcus macedonicus and pediococcus pentosaceus. a  wide phenotypic and genomic heterogeneity was observed within the different species (lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and leuconostoc mesenteroides) according to the origin and the time of ripening. the natural microflora was different from strain collection and each method must be combined  to identify and characterize natural microflora. this study revealed the low selectivity of selective media used for the isolation of different groups of lactic acid bacteria except the facultatively heterofermentative lactobacilli medium selecting mesophile lactobacilli and sb medium selective for enterococcus. the study reveals, for the first time, the microbial lactic acid bacteria community of salers cheese and its diversity. a better knowledge of microbial flora will be useful to improve understanding of sensory quality of cheeses.

TI  == commensal gram-negative bacteria prime human dendritic cells for enhanced il-23 and il-27 expression and enhanced th1 development.
AB  == dendritic cells (dc) are the main orchestrators of specific immune responses. depending on microbial information they encounter in peripheral tissues, they promote the development of th1, th2 or unpolarized th cell responses. in this study we have investigated the immunomodulatory effect of non-pathogenic intestinal gram-negative (escherichia coli, bacteroides vulgatus,veillonella parvula, pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram-positive (bifidobacterium adolescentis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus plantarum and staphylococcus aureus) bacteria on human monocyte-derived dc (modc). none of the gram-positive bacteria  (gpb) primed for th1 or th2 development. in contrast, despite the low levels of il-12 they induce, all gram-negative bacteria (gnb) primed modc for enhanced th1  cell development, which was dependent on il-12 and an additional unidentified cofactor. strikingly, gnb-matured modc expressed elevated levels of p19 and p28 mrna, the critical subunits of il-23 and il-27, respectively, suggesting that the il-12 family members may jointly be responsible for their th1-driving capacity. purified major cell wall components of either gnb or gpb did not yield th cell profiles identical to those obtained with whole bacteria, and could not explain the induction of the il-12 family members nor th1 priming by gnb. importantly, this study gives indications that the expression of the different il-12 family members is dictated by different priming conditions of immature dc.

TI  == bacterial community structure and location in stilton cheese.
AB  == the microbial diversity occurring in stilton cheese was evaluated by 16s ribosomal dna analysis with pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. dna templates for pcr experiments were directly extracted from the cheese as well as  bulk cells harvested from a variety of viable-count media. the variable v3 and v4-v5 regions of the 16s genes were analyzed. closest relatives of lactococcus lactis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus curvatus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, staphylococcus equorum, and staphylococcus sp. were identified by sequencing of the dgge fragments. fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probes were developed to detect lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, and leuconostoc mesenteroides in fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) experiments, and their specificity for the species occurring in the community of stilton cheese was checked in fish experiments carried out with reference cultures. the combined use of these probes and the bacterial probe eub338 in fish experiments on stilton cheese sections allowed the assessment of the spatial distribution of the different microbial species in the dairy matrix.  microbial colonies of bacteria showed a differential location in the different parts of the cheese examined: the core, the veins, and the crust. lactococci were found in the internal part of the veins as mixed colonies and as single colonies  within the core. lactobacillus plantarum was detected only underneath the surface, while leuconostoc microcolonies were homogeneously distributed in all parts observed. the combined molecular approach is shown to be useful to simultaneously describe the structure and location of the bacterial flora in cheese. the differential distribution of species found suggests specific ecological reasons for the establishment of sites of actual microbial growth in the cheese, with implications of significance in understanding the ecology of food systems and with the aim of achieving optimization of the fermentation technologies as well as preservation of traditional products.

TI  == phylogenetic diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with paddy rice silage  as determined by 16s ribosomal dna analysis.
AB  == a total of 161 low-g+c-content gram-positive bacteria isolated from whole-crop paddy rice silage were classified and subjected to phenotypic and genetic analyses. based on morphological and biochemical characters, these presumptive lactic acid bacterium (lab) isolates were divided into 10 groups that included members of the genera enterococcus, lactobacillus, lactococcus, leuconostoc, pediococcus, and weissella: analysis of the 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) was used to  confirm the presence of the predominant groups indicated by phenotypic analysis and to determine the phylogenetic affiliation of representative strains. the virtually complete 16s rrna gene was pcr amplified and sequenced. the sequences from the various lab isolates showed high degrees of similarity to those of the genbank reference strains (between 98.7 and 99.8%). phylogenetic trees based on the 16s rdna sequence displayed high consistency, with nodes supported by high bootstrap values. with the exception of one species, the genetic data was in agreement with the phenotypic identification. the prevalent lab, predominantly homofermentative (66%), consisted of lactobacillus plantarum (24%), lactococcus lactis (22%), leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (20%), pediococcus acidilactici (11%), lactobacillus brevis (11%), enterococcus faecalis (7%), weissella kimchii  (3%), and pediococcus pentosaceus (2%). the present study, the first to fully document rice-associated lab, showed a very diverse community of lab with a relatively high number of species involved in the fermentation process of paddy rice silage. the comprehensive 16s rdna-based approach to describing lab community structure was valuable in revealing the large diversity of bacteria inhabiting paddy rice silage and enabling the future design of appropriate inoculants aimed at improving its fermentation quality.

TI  == esterolytic and lipolytic activities of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ewe's  milk and cheese.
AB  == in the present work, we report on the esterase and lipase activities of lactic acid bacteria representing the genera lactococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus, and enterococcus isolated from ewe's milk and cheeses. esterase activity was studied using alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 12 carbon atoms and postelectrophoretic detection. the lactic acid bacteria evaluated had intracellular esterase activities, which preferentially degraded the alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 6 carbon atoms. by studying postelectrophoretic patterns, it was found that some strains presented more than one esterase. lactobacillus plantarum o236 showed four enzymes that hydrolyze carboxyl ester linkages with different specificity. lipase activity was studied in intracellular and extracellular fractions using tributyrin, tricaprylin, triolein, and milk fat as substrates. the intracellular and extracellular fractions of leuconostoc mesenteroides o257, lactobacillus plantarum o236, and lactobacillus acidophilus o177 were able to hydrolyze tributyrin. l. plantarum o186, l. acidophilus o252, enterococcus faecium o174 and o426, and enterococcus faecalis ov409 showed lipase activity associated with the intracellular fraction on tributyrin. lactococcus lactis o233, l. plantarum o155, and lactobacillus casei o190 did not hydrolyze triglycerides. not all strains that showed esterase activity exhibited high activity on triglycerides. esterase and lipase activities were species- and strain-specific. wide variations in activity between strains highlight the need for selecting appropriate starters to produce enzyme-modified cheese as well as accelerated ripened cheese.

TI  == the lactoperoxidase system increases efficacy of high-pressure inactivation of foodborne bacteria.
AB  == the inactivation of eight different bacteria comprising escherichia coli lmm1010  and mg1655, respectively a pressure-resistant strain and the corresponding wild-type, salmonella typhimurium, pseudomonas fluorescens, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua and lactobacillus plantarum, by high hydrostatic pressure in skim milk supplemented with the lactoperoxidase-hydrogen peroxide-thiocyanate (lp) system at naturally occurring  concentration was studied. in the absence of pressure treatment, the lp system had either no effect, i.e. on s. typhimurium and e. coli lmm1010, a growth inhibiting effect, i.e. on e. coli mg1655, l. innocua, s. aureus, l. plantarum and e. faecalis, or a bactericidal effect, i.e. on p. fluorescens. the presence of the lp system affected inactivation by high pressure in a cell density-dependent manner. at low cell concentration (10(6) cfu/ml), the lp system strongly increased high-pressure inactivation as measured immediately after pressure treatment of all bacteria except the pressure-resistant e. coli. at high cell density (10(9) cfu/ml), only inactivation of l. innocua, e. faecalis and l.  plantarum were enhanced. for both e. coli strains, the fate of the bacteria during 24 h following pressure treatment was also studied. it was found that in the presence of the lp system, considerable further inactivation occurred in the  first hours after pressure treatment. the potential of the lp system to improve the bactericidal efficiency of high-pressure treatment for food preservation is discussed.

TI  == innate immune responses of human neonatal cells to bacteria from the normal gastrointestinal flora.
AB  == the hygiene hypothesis postulates that the prevalence of allergy has increased due to decreased microbial stimulation early in life, leading to delayed maturation of the immune system. the aim of this study was to examine the cytokine pattern produced from cord blood mononuclear cells relative to adult cells after stimulation with bacterial strains from the normal flora. mononuclear cells from cord and adult blood samples were stimulated with the following bacteria: bifidobacterium adolescentis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus mitis, corynebacterium minutissimum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides vulgatus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, veillonella parvula, and neisseria sicca. the levels of interleukin 12 (il-12), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-10, and il-6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the tnf-alpha production was also analyzed after blocking cd14, toll-like receptor 2 (tlr-2), and tlr-4 prior to stimulation with bacteria. the levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha were similar in cord and adult cells. gram-positive bacteria induced considerably higher levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha than gram-negative bacteria in both cord and adult cells. the levels of il-6 were significantly higher in newborns than in adults, whereas the levels of  il-10 were similar in newborns and adults. gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria induced similar levels of il-6 and il-10 in cord cells. l. plantarum bound or signaled through cd14, tlr-2, and tlr-4, whereas e. coli acted mainly through cd14 and tlr-4. these results indicate that the innate immune response in newborns to commensal bacteria is strong and also suggest that different bacterial strains may have differential effects on the maturation of the immune system of infants.

TI  == bacterial inactivation by high-pressure homogenisation and high hydrostatic pressure.
AB  == the resistance of five gram-positive bacteria, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus plantarum, listeria innocua and leuconostoc  dextranicum, and six gram-negative bacteria, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, shigella flexneri, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas fluorescens  and two strains of escherichia coli, to high-pressure homogenisation (100-300 mpa) and to high hydrostatic pressure (200-400 mpa) was compared in this study. within the group of gram-positive bacteria and within the group of gram-negative  bacteria, large differences were observed in resistance to high hydrostatic pressure, but not to high-pressure homogenisation. all gram-positive bacteria were more resistant than any of the gram-negative bacteria to high-pressure homogenisation, while in relative to high hydrostatic pressure resistance both groups overlapped. within the group of gram-negative bacteria, there also existed another order in resistance to high-pressure homogenisation than to high hydrostatic pressure. further it appears that the mutant e. coli lmm1010, which is resistant to high hydrostatic pressure is not more resistant to high-pressure  homogenisation than its parental strain mg1655. the preceding observations indicate a different response of the test bacteria to high-pressure homogenisation compared to high hydrostatic pressure treatment, which suggests that the underlying inactivation mechanisms for both techniques are different. further, no sublethal injury could be observed upon high-pressure homogenisation  of y. enterocolitica and s. aureus cell population by using low ph (5.5 7), nacl  (0 6%) or sds (0-100 mg/l) as selective components in the plating medium. finally, it was observed that successive rounds of high-pressure homogenisation have an additive effect on viability reduction of y. enterocolitica and s. aureus.

AB  == in this study, 83 clinical isolates purified from biofilms colonizing 18 silicone gastrostomy devices (12 "buttons" and six tubes converted to skin level devices)  were selected for subtype characterization utilizing genetic analysis. the tubes, previously used for feeding, remained in place for 3 to 47 months (mean, 20.0 months) in children ranging in age from 6 months to 17 years. classification of specific microbes using random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis revealed genetic similarities and differences among isolates belonging to the same genus.  both gram-positive and -negative bacteria were investigated, including 2 isolates of bacillus brevis, 4 isolates of bacillus licheniformis, 2 isolates of bacillus  pumilus, 3 isolates of enterococcus durans, 19 isolates of enterococcus faecalis, 8 isolates of enterococcus faecium, 2 isolates of enterococcus hirae, 7 isolates  of escherichia coli, 8 isolates of lactobacillus plantarum, 19 isolates of staphylococcus aureus, 2 isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, and 7 isolates of staphylococcus saprophyticus. amplified dna fragments (amplicons) provided species-specific fingerprints for comparison by agarose gel electrophoresis. a total of 62 distinct rapd types were categorized from the five genera studied. typing analysis suggested cross acquisition of e. coli, e. faecalis, and s. aureus in three patient pairs. genomic polymorphism detection proved efficient and reliable for classifying bacterial subtypes isolated from biofilms adhering to various portions of commonly employed enteral access tubes.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
AB  == bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of  ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.

TI  == [evaluation of the bacterial flora in natural corn silage].
AB  == silage is the best method for forage conservation, keeping it in a fresh condition and with high nutrient content. in order to study the natural evolution of maize silage without additives during 50 days after sealed, ph, temperature changes, number and type of the indigenous bacteria were studied every 5 days. the initial ph decreased from 6.40 to 4.10 and temperature stabilized at 26 degrees c. the mesophilic aerobic bacteria were quickly reduced across time. enterococci were descended gradually. clostridia remained in a low quantity. the  microorganisms most frequently isolated were escherichia coli, clostridium butyricum, enterococcus faecalis and lactobacillus plantarum; this acid lactic bacteria was the principal cause of the abundant production of anaerobic fermentation of sugars in the forage reaching the ph which maintained the silage  in adequate conditions.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum reduces infection of pancreatic necrosis in experimental  acute pancreatitis.
AB  == background: infection is the commonest cause of death in acute pancreatitis. early reduction of commensal flora (particularly lactobacillus species) and, at the same time, overgrowth of enterobacteriaceae, especially escherichia coli, have recently been described during acute pancreatitis. lactobacillus plantarum has been shown to be effective in reducing the egress of endotoxin and microbial  translocation in several experimental models such as chemically induced hepatitis and ulcerative colitis. aim: the aim of the study was to determine whether l. plantarum 299v (lp 299v) is capable of effectively reducing microbial translocation in experimental pancreatitis. methods: acute pancreatitis was induced by isolation and ligation of the biliopancreatic duct in lewis rats weighing 250-350 g. the animals were divided into 3 groups: group a, sham operation; group b, induction of pancreatitis and no further treatment, and group c, induction of pancreatitis + daily administration by gavage of a 5-ml/day suspension of lp 299v at 0.5-1.0 x 10(9) bacteria/ml for 8 days, 4 days before and 4 days after induction of pancreatitis. all animals were sacrificed after 96  h. histological studies and microbiological analyses were performed. results: at  sacrifice, 40/55 animals showed signs of severe pancreatitis. since acute pancreatitis was the specific disease investigated, only these animals were subjected to further study. in group b, we found pathogenic micro-organisms in the mesenteric lymph nodes in 14/20 animals and in the pancreatic tissue in 10/20. the bacterial flora consisted predominantly of e. coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas and proteus species. in contrast, when the animals were kept under an 'umbrella' of lp 299v, growth of e. faecalis or e. coli were detected only in 4/20 mesenteric lymph node cultures and in 3/20 pancreatic tissue cultures. conclusions: lp 299v is effective in reducing microbial translocation in experimental pancreatitis. treatment with probiotic bacteria seems to be a promising alternative to antibiotic therapy.

TI  == [the range of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. on the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, most frequently l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the  same environment. the diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties  bacteria of the genus lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this  ecosystem. the aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. it was found that nearly all of the tested  lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia and peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit gram-positive aerobic cocci as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == [a probiotic as an antagonist of bacterial translocation in experimental pancreatitis].
AB  == infection is the most common cause of death in acute pancreatitis. earlier studies have demonstrated that early enteral nutrition decreases microbial translocation, upregulates the immune function and reduces septic complications and mortality. lactobacillus plantarum (lp) has been shown to be effective in reducing egress of endotoxin and microbial strain that showed very high adherence power to gut mucosa. we adopted a model of acute pancreatitis induced by isolation and ligation of biliopancreatic duct in adult lewis rats. three groups  were studied: a. control group (sham operation); b. induced pancreatitis, no further treatment; c. induced pancreatitis + gavage with 5 ml/day of a suspension of lp 299 v in a dose of 0.5-1.0 x 10(9)/ml during 4 days before and 4 days after induction of pancreatitis. all animals were sacrificed after 96 hours. histological studies and microbiological analyses were performed. forty out of 55 animals showed signs of severe pancreatitis on sacrifice after 96 hours. only these animals were further studied. in group a, we found only 1/20 bacteria in mesenteric nodes (mn). pathogenic microrganisms were found in the non-treated group in mn in 14/20 and in the pancreatic tissue in 10/20. in contrast, when kept on an umbrella of lp 299 v, only 4/20 animals demonstrated growth of enteric bacteria in mn and 3/20 in pancreatic tissue. all of these results showed a significant reduction of infection in the treated groups. in our model, lp 299 v  is effective in preventing microbial translocation in experimental pancreatitis.  treatment with probiotic bacteria, such as lactobacillus spp, seems to be a promising alternative as problems with antibiotic-resistant bacteria seem to accumulate.

TI  == identification and characterization of enterococcus species isolated from forage  crops and their influence on silage fermentation.
AB  == forty-eight strains of lactic acid bacteria were isolated from forage crops, and  their identification, characterization and influence on silage fermentation were  studied. all isolates were gram-positive, short-chain-forming, catalase-negative, and facultatively anaerobic cocci that did not produce gas from glucose, only formed l-lactic acid, and were able to grow at ph 9.6%, in 6.5% nacl, or with 40% bile, but not below ph 4.5. these isolates were commonly isolated from forage crops, and they were divided into four groups (a, b, c, and d) according to sugar fermentation characteristics. selected strains of fa 5, fa 27, fa 45, and fa 57 were identified as enterococcus hirae, e. faecalis, e. casseliflavus, and e. mundtii, respectively, on the basis of dna-dna homology, strains fa 5, fa 27, fa  45, and fa 57 and two strains from commercial inoculants, lc 10 (lactobacillus casei) and lp 15 (l. plantarum), were used as additives to alfalfa and guinea grass silages. alphalfa and guinea grass silages inoculated with lc 10, lp 15, fa 5 + lc 10, and fa 5 + lp 15-treatments in alfalfa and guinea grass silages had significantly lower ph values, contents of butyric acid and ammonia nitrogen, gas production, and dry matter losses compared with the control silage after 60 d of  fermentation. however, the e. hirae fa 5, e. faecalis fa 27, e. casseliflavus fa  45, and e. mundtii fa 57-inoculated silages gave similar values to the control in both types of silage. the fa 27 + lc 10 and fa 27 + lp 15-inoculated silages did  not differ in fermentation quality from lc 10 and lp 15-inoculated silages alone. the results confirmed that enterococcus species were not able to improve silage quality.

TI  == isolation, purification and partial characterization of plantaricin 423, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum.

TI  == plasmid integration in a wide range of bacteria mediated by the integrase of lactobacillus delbrueckii bacteriophage mv4.
AB  == bacteriophage mv4 is a temperate phage infecting lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. during lysogenization, the phage integrates its genome into the host  chromosome at the 3' end of a trna(ser) gene through a site-specific recombination process (l. dupont et al., j. bacteriol., 177:586-595, 1995). a nonreplicative vector (pmc1) based on the mv4 integrative elements (attp site and integrase-coding int gene) is able to integrate into the chromosome of a wide range of bacterial hosts, including lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus casei  (two strains), lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. integrative recombination of pmc1 into the chromosomes  of all of these species is dependent on the int gene product and occurs specifically at the pmc1 attp site. the isolation and sequencing of pmc1 integration sites from these bacteria showed that in lactobacilli, pmc1 integrated into the conserved trna(ser) gene. in the other bacterial species where this trna gene is less or not conserved; secondary integration sites either in potential protein-coding regions or in intergenic dna were used. a consensus sequence was deduced from the analysis of the different integration sites. the comparison of these sequences demonstrated the flexibility of the integrase for the bacterial integration site and suggested the importance of the trinucleotide  cct at the 5' end of the core in the strand exchange reaction.

AB  == lactococcus lactis contains numerous restriction and modification (r/m) systems of different specificities. a novel iis type r/m system encoded by the llai operon has previously been characterized from the l. lactis conjugative plasmid ptr2030. the llai operon is composed of six genes: first, a small regulatory gene llaic precedes the methylase gene llaim. the following three genes, llai.1, llai.2, llai.3, are all essential for restriction endonuclease activity and are designed as the restriction cassette llair. the forth open reading frame of unknown function follows the llair gene cassette. we have successfully subcloned  the three llair genes, llai.1, llai.2, and llai.3, without llaim, as a suicide cassette into the three shuttle vectors ptrkl2, ptrkh2, and pbv5030. a promoter (p6) from lactobacillus acidophilus atcc4356, which is functional in e. coli, lactococci, and lactobacilli (djordjevic and topisirovic, unpublished) was cloned upstream of the three gene cassette. restriction activity was evaluated in escherichia coli and several gram-positive bacteria. the llair restriction cassette was not functional in e. coli, but its presence was lethal to l. lactis, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus acidophilus, carnobacterium pisicola, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, and leuconostoc gelidum. several novel, positive selection cloning vectors were developed that can exploit unique cloning sites within the llair cassette. insertions in llai.1 resulted in complete inactivation of restriction activity and provided unconditional selection for recombinant plasmids in surviving transformants. these positive selection cloning vectors are the first for gram-positive bacteria that are based on a restriction endonuclease cassette. functional activity of the llair genes in various gram-positive bacteria would also enable use of these cloning vectors for positive selection of promoters, terminators, and regulatory sequences across these genera.

TI  == development of rapd protocol for typing of strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci.
AB  == a protocol for typing strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci based on randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) fragments has been developed. using a single 10-mer primer, fingerprints were achieved without the need to isolate genomic dna. different conditions of dna release and amplification were investigated in order to obtain reproducible results and high discrimination among strains. this rapd protocol was successfully applied for the typing of strains belonging to the species lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. helveticus, lact. casei, lact. reuteri, lact. plantarum, enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium  and streptococcus thermophilus.

TI  == use of homologous expression-secretion signals and vector-free stable chromosomal integration in engineering of lactobacillus plantarum for alpha-amylase and levanase expression.
AB  == the genuine alpha-amylase gene from bacillus licheniformis (amyl) is not expressed in lactobacillus plantarum, but replacement of the amyl promoter by a strong l. plantarum promoter leads to efficient expression of the gene and secretion of more than 90% of the alpha-amylase into the culture supernatant. a series of l. plantarum genetic cassettes (transcription and translation with or without secretion) were cloned by translation fusion of random dna fragments to the silent amyl coding frame in the pgip212 probe vector (p. hols, a. baulard, d. garmyn, b. delplace, s. hogan, and j. delcour, gene 118:21-30, 1992). five different cassettes were sequenced and found to harbor genetic signals similar to those of other gram-positive bacteria. the functions of the cloned cassettes and  the cassettes isolated previously from enterococcus faecalis were compared in e.  faecalis and l. plantarum, respectively. all signals were well recognized in l. plantarum, but cassettes isolated from l. plantarum led to a low level of amylase production in e. faecalis, suggesting that the l. plantarum signals are more species specific. six transcriptional or translational fusions were constructed to express the bacillus subtilis levanase gene (sacc) in l. plantarum. all of these constructions were capable of inducing levanase production and secretion in the culture supernatant, and, furthermore, l. plantarum strains harboring the most efficient fusions could grow in mrs medium containing inulin as the major carbon source. finally, a two-step chromosomal integration procedure was used to  achieve efficient stabilization of an amylase construction without any residual resistance marker or vector sequence.

TI  == detection, identification and characterization of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria from retail food products.
AB  == forty bacteriocin-producing (bac+) lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from  food samples purchased from retail supermarkets and local farms. of the 40 bac+ isolates, 18 were isolated from 85 food samples by enrichment (21% isolation rate) whereas eight were obtained from 63 samples by direct plating (13% isolation rate). by direct plating, bac+ lab were detected at levels up to 2.4 x  10(5) cfu/g in ready-to-eat meats. the bac+ isolates were identified by carbohydrate fermentation patterns, sds-page protein patterns, and other biochemical characteristics; sds-page proved invaluable in identifying strains that could not be identified by other means. differential inhibitory spectra against indicator microorganisms assisted in the identification of 19 unique bac+ isolates. bac+ lab included enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus curvatus, lb. delbrueckii, lb. plantarum, lactococcus lactis, and pediococcus acidilactici. lb. curvatus (four strains) and lc. lactis (nine strains) were the only isolates inhibitory to foodborne pathogens including listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and staphylococcus aureus. some lc. lactis isolates inhibited as many as nine gram-positive genera. lb. curvatus fs47 and fs65 grew to high cell densities and produced bacteriocin at 6 degrees c; however, lc. lactis fs56 produced greater levels of bacteriocin at lower cell densities. the high incidence of bac+ lab detected in retail foods indicates that the public is consuming a wide variety of bac+ lab that occur as natural contaminants. these data suggest a greater role for bacteriocins as biopreservatives in food.

TI  == factors affecting transfer frequency of pam beta 1 from streptococcus faecalis to lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == conjugal transfer of streptococcal plasmid pam beta 1 to lactobacillus plantarum  by a filter mating method was examined under various conditions. the transfer frequency depended greatly on the type, pore size, and side (front or back) of the membrane filter. the passage of sterilized water through the membrane under reduced pressure after donor and recipient cells were trapped on it increased the transfer frequency about 10-fold.

TI  == proteolytic activity of lactic acid bacteria in skim milk with special reference  to the biodegradation of casein fractions.
AB  == streptococci and lactobacilli were assayed for their proteolytic activity in pasteurised (95 degrees c for 30 min) fresh friesian cows' skim milk incubated at 30 degrees c for 48 h. lactobacilli were more proteolytic than the streptococci except s. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens. s. faecalis and s. thermophilus followed  s. lactis subsp. diacetylactis in the proteolytic activity. electrophoretic analysis of the precipitated casein revealed k-, pre-beta- and the small slow band of alpha s1-casein to be the most fractions and beta-casein the least fraction susceptible to the biodegradation. s. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens was the only organism able to degrade beta-casein to 3 fractions within 48 h. s. lactis with its subsp. diacetylactis was characterized by its inability to degrade gamma-casein. addition of 2.0 g glucose, 0.5 g yeast extract, 2.0 mmol mg2+, 0.5 mmol mn2+ and 0.1 mmol fe2+/l of skim milk culture of each l. casei and l. plantarum increased acid formation but decreased proteolysis. 6% nacl was inhibitory to both. after 60 days at 18 degrees c, a fraction, probably derived from beta-casein, was noticeable. the large intense band of alpha s1-casein appears to be degraded gradually to only small peptides which in turn are transferred immediately into the cells. the hydrolysis of gamma-casein and beta-casein also appears to be inhibited by exogenously supplied nacl and nutrients, respectively.

TI  == [behavior of some microorganisms cultivated in the presence of irradiated maize starch].
AB  == the bactericidal effect of water soluble radiolysis products of maize starch on escherichia coli cultures declines when the initial population grows. this toxicity varies with the culture environment and the bacterial species: bacillus  subtilis, lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus faecalis, enterobacter sp. moreover, for the eucaryote cell saccharomyces cerevisiae, wild strain or muting  "small colonies", only the generating time is altered by the active parts of radiolysis products. the results are analysed with regard to the hypothesis that  the hydrogen peroxide is responsible for this toxicity.

TI  == synthesis and microbiological activities of some monohalogenated analogs of tyrosine.
AB  == 2-chlorotyrosine and 2-bromotyrosine, as well as the previously reported 2-fluorotyrosine, were synthesized by hydrolysis of the condensation products from the appropriate benzyl bromide and ethyl acetamidomalonate and were compared with the corresponding 3-halotyrosines as growth inhibitors of escherichia coli 9723, streptococcus faecalis 8043 and lactobacillus plantarum 8014. in contrast to the 2- and 3-fluorotyrosines which were equally effective as growth inhibitors, the 2-chloro- and 2-bromotyrosines were much more effective than the  3-chloro- and 3-bromotyrosines in inhibiting the growth of the three microorganisms. for each of the assay organisms, the growth inhibitions of all three 2-halotyrosines were reversed competitively in varying degrees by tyrosine.

TI  == transport of aminophosphonic acids in lactobacillus plantarum and streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == aminophosphonic acids analogous to glutamic acid, aspartic acid, alanine, and valine were actively accumulated by lactobacillus plantarum. uptake was dependent on the availability of glucose and, in all cases, the estimated intracellular concentrations substantially exceeded extracellular levels. during uptake, there  was little metabolism of tritiated 2-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid (app), the aspartic acid analogue, and a negligible incorporation of isotope from this substance into the nucleic acid, lipid, protein, or cell wall fractions of the cell. competition studies with app indicated that its transport in l. plantarum and in streptococcus faecalis was antagonized only by structurally related compounds such as glutamic, aspartic, and cysteic acids. kinetic studies showed that app was taken up by a single catalytic system in s. faecalis. a mutant strain of this organism which lacks one of two kinetically distinguishable dicarboxylic amino acid transport systems failed to accumulate measurable amounts of app. these experiments indicate that the aminophosphonic acids are accumulated by the amino acid transport systems in these bacteria with minimal metabolic changes.

TI  == growth of lactic acid bacteria in waste waters of vegetable-processing plants.
AB  == waters used in washing, blanching, cooling, and conveying vegetables during processing for freezing were filtered, sterilized, and inoculated with streptococcus faecalis, s. lactis, or lactobacillus plantarum. the contents of total nitrogen and total solids were determined, and ninhydrin tests and benedict's tests for reducing sugars were performed. substances positive to the ninyhydrin tests and also capable of supporting the growth of the bacteria to high levels of population were found in waters used to blanch cut green beans, but not in the cooling or conveying waters. they were found only in waters following slicing of blanched whole beans. they were also present in waters used  in processing purple hull peas at all stages, but only in the waters used to blanch and cool lima beans. the substances were present in waters used to wash and blanch squash, but only in the waters used to blanch greens; they were not found in the cooling waters during the handling of either vegetable. no waters used in the processing of okra yielded a positive ninhydrin test, nor did they support the growth of the lactic acid bacteria.

AB  == johnston, m. a. (cornell university, ithaca, n.y.), and e. a. delwiche. distribution and characteristics of the catalases of lactobacillaceae. j. bacteriol. 90:347-351. 1965.-certain strains of lactobacilli and pediococci incorporated hematin during growth, with the concomitant formation of cyanide- and azide-sensitive catalase. three of five strains of lactobacilli and five of 25 strains of pediococci were capable of this biosynthesis. the pediococci required the heme component of blood, whereas the lactobacilli could incorporate  the heme component in the form of purified and solubilized hemin or from blood. in all cases where inhibitor-sensitive enzyme was produced, it was accompanied by the production of inhibitor-insensitive enzyme. in the absence of hematin, only insensitive enzyme was obtained. two catalase-positive strains of streptococcus faecalis were found incapable of the synthesis of a heme-type enzyme, as was one  member of the genus leuconostoc. iron and manganese in the growth medium stimulated the production of the insensitive catalase, but significant quantities of these metals could not be found in a purified enzyme preparation obtained from lactobacillus plantarum. aeration had little or no effect on growth, but it consistently doubled the amount of cyanide- and azide-resistant catalase. by means of conventional enzyme fractionation techniques, it was possible to separate the two different enzymes present in the cell-free extract of a strain of pediococcus homari which had been grown in the presence of blood.
