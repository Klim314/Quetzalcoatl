TI  == relationship of specific vaginal bacteria and bacterial vaginosis treatment failure in women who have sex with women.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis frequently persists after treatment. the role of  newly defined bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria (bvab), which have a specificity for this condition of 97% or greater, has not been assessed. objective: to define risks for bacterial vaginosis persistence, including pretreatment detection of specific vaginal bacteria, among women reporting sex with women. design: observational cohort study. setting: university-based research clinic. patients: 335 women age 16 to 29 years reporting sex with at least 1 woman in the past year. participants were recruited through advertisements and provider referral. intervention: bacterial vaginosis was treated with intravaginal metronidazole gel (0.75%), 37.5 mg nightly for 5 nights. measurements: species-specific 16s recombinant dna polymerase chain reaction assays targeting 17 bacterial species were applied to vaginal fluid obtained at baseline. test of cure by clinical criteria and gram stain analysis and repeated polymerase chain reaction assays of vaginal fluid were performed 1 month after treatment, and interim behaviors were assessed by using computer-assisted self-interview. results: of 335 women, 24% of whom also reported sex with men within 3 months before enrollment, 131 (39%) had bacterial  vaginosis. in the 120 (92%) women who returned for follow-up, the incidence of persistent bacterial vaginosis was 26% and was statistically significantly higher in women with baseline detection of 3 clostridiales bacteria, designated as bvab1 (risk ratio, 2.0 [95% ci, 1.1 to 4.0]), bvab2 (risk ratio, 8.7 [ci, 2.5 to infinity]), or bvab3 (risk ratio, 3.1 [ci, 1.7 to 5.8]); peptoniphilus lacrimalis (risk ratio, 3.5 [ci, 1.6 to 15.5]); and megasphaera phylotype 2 (risk ratio, 3.4 [ci, 1.4 to 5.5]). persistence was lower with treatment adherence (risk ratio, 0.4 [0.2 to 0.9]). detection of these bacteria at the test-of-cure visit was associated with persistence, whereas posttreatment sexual activity was not. limitations: findings may not be generalizable to women who have sex only with men, or to women whose bacterial vaginosis is treated with oral antibiotics. the  study may be too small and may involve a population that is too highly selected to draw definitive conclusions about associations of persistent infection with posttreatment sexual behaviors. conclusion: persistent bacterial vaginosis is associated with several bacteria in the clostridiales order, megasphaera phylotype 2, and p. lacrimalis, suggesting that vaginal microbiology at diagnosis may determine risk for antibiotic failure.

TI  == rapid identification of gram-positive anaerobic coccal species originally classified in the genus peptostreptococcus by multiplex pcr assays using genus- and species-specific primers.
AB  == here, a rapid and reliable two-step multiplex pcr assay for identifying 14 gram-positive anaerobic cocci (gpac) species originally classified in the genus peptostreptococcus (anaerococcus hydrogenalis, anaerococcus lactolyticus, anaerococcus octavius, anaerococcus prevotii, anaerococcus tetradius, anaerococcus vaginalis, finegoldia magna, micromonas micros, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, peptoniphilus harei, peptoniphilus indolicus, peptoniphilus ivorii and peptoniphilus lacrimalis) is reported. fourteen type strains representing 14 gpac species were first identified to the genus level by multiplex pcr (multiplex pcr-g). since three of these genera (finegoldia, micromonas and peptostreptococcus) contain only a single species, f. magna, m. micros and p. anaerobius, respectively, these organisms were identified to the species level directly by using the multiplex pcr-g. then six species of the genus anaerococcus (a. hydrogenalis, a. lactolyticus, a. octavius, a. prevotii, a. vaginalis and a. tetradius) were further identified to the species level using multiplex pcr assays (multiplex pcr-ia and multiplex pcr-ib). similarly, five species of the genus peptoniphilus (pn. asaccharolyticus, pn. harei, pn. indolicus, pn. ivorii and pn. lacrimalis) were identified to the species level using multiplex pcr-iia and multiplex pcr-iib. the established two-step multiplex pcr identification scheme was applied to the identification of 190 clinical isolates of gpac species that had been identified previously to the  species level by 16s rrna sequencing and phenotypic tests. the identification obtained from multiplex pcr assays showed 100 % agreement with 16s rdna sequencing identification, but only 65 % (123/190) agreement with the identification obtained by phenotypic tests. the multiplex pcr scheme established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of gpac species. it will permit a more accurate assessment of the role of various gpac species in infection and of the degree of antimicrobial resistance in each of the group members.

TI  == heterogeneity within the gram-positive anaerobic cocci demonstrated by analysis of 16s-23s intergenic ribosomal rna polymorphisms.
AB  == peptostreptococci are gram-positive, strictly anaerobic bacteria which, although  regarded as members of the commensal human microflora, are also frequently isolated from sites of clinical infection. the study of this diverse group of opportunist pathogens has been hindered by an inadequate taxonomy and the lack of a valid identification scheme. recent re-classification of the peptostreptococcus family into five distinct genus groups has helped to clarify the situation. however, this has been on the basis of 16s rrna sequence determinations, which are both time-consuming and expensive. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of pcr-amplified ribosomal dna spacer polymorphisms for the rapid differentiation of the currently recognised taxa within the group of anaerobic gram-positive cocci. a collection comprising 19 reference strains with  representatives of each of the 15 species, two close relatives and two of the well-characterised groups, together with 38 test strains was studied. all strains were identified to species group level by phenotypic means. amplification of the  16s-23s intergenic spacer region (isr) with universal primers produced distinct banding patterns for all the 19 reference strains and the patterns could be differentiated easily visually. however, of the 38 test strains, less than half could be speciated from isr analysis alone. only five groups produced correlating banding patterns for all members tested (peptoniphilus lacrimalis, p. ivorii, anaerococcus octavius, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and micromonas micros). for  other species, either the type strain differed significantly from other species members (e.g., a. hydrogenalis) or there appeared to be considerable intra-species variation (e.g., a. vaginalis). partial 16s rrna gene sequences for the 'trisimilis' and 'betagal' groups showed that both are most closely related to the anaerococcus group. this work highlights the heterogeneous nature of a number of peptostreptococcus species and hence the need for still further revision of the taxonomy of this important group of pathogens.
