TI  - Serum antibodies reacting with subgingival species in refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to compare the levels of serum IgG antibody to 85 subgingival species in 32 refractory periodontitis, 56 successfully treated, and 33 periodontally healthy subjects. Refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or >3 sites showing attachment loss >2.5 mm within 1 year after 2 treatment modalities, scaling and root planing and surgery plus systemically administered tetracycline. Successfully-treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss >2.5 mm, 1 year post-therapy. Periodontally healthy subjects exhibited no pocket or attachment level >3 mm, and no evidence of progressing attachment loss during 1 year of monitoring. Baseline serum was obtained from each subject and tested against 85 subgingival species, including reference strains and strains isolated from refractory subjects, using checkerboard immunoblotting. Significance of differences in levels of serum antibody among groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their serum antibody response to subgingival species. Some individuals had antibody reactions to many subgingival species, while other subjects showed fewer or low numbers of responses. On average, refractory subjects exhibited higher numbers and levels of serum antibody reactions to a wide range of subgingival species than successfully treated or periodontally healthy subjects. Differences in serum antibody among clinical groups were more striking at higher threshold levels of antibody (>50 microg/ml and > 100 microg/ml). The data showed that a subject was 10.1 x more likely to be refractory if the subject exhibited antibody reactions with >9 subgingival species at >50 microg/ml (p<0.001, after adjusting for multiple comparisons). Serum antibody to a subset of the test species differed among the clinical groups. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroidesforsythus, and some strains isolated from refractory subjects (a novel Neisseria sp., Enterococcus faecalis, Prevotella loescheii and Prevotella oulora) elicited high serum antibody in the successfully treated and refractory subjects. High levels of serum antibody to a Microbacterium lacticum-like organism, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus constellatus, Actinobacillus actinonmycetemcomitans serotype c and Haemophilus aphrophilus significantly increased the likelihood of a subject being refractory to conventional periodontal therapy.
TI  - Molecular and immunological characterization of a 64-kDa protein of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - The 64-kDa protein to which about half the sera from patients with localized juvenile periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis reacted strongly was purified from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4. Determination of the N-terminal sequence of the protein revealed that it was a GroEL-like protein. The DNA fragment containing the groEL gene of A. actinomycetemcomitans was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and the groESL operon was cloned by using colony hybridization with the amplified fragment from A. actinomycetemcomitans chromosomal DNA. Sequence analysis revealed that structures of the operon and its products were typical in gram-negative bacteria. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the 64-kDa protein cross-reacted with approximately 65-kDa proteins of Haemophilus aphrophilus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus paraphrophilus, Escherichia coli and Eikenella corrodens but not with any cellular proteins of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum. It is possible that antibodies reactive to the 64-kDa protein in periodontitis patients are induced by the cross-reactivity with the hsp60 proteins of other bacteria.
