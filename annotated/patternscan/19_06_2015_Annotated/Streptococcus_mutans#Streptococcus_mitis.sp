TI  == antibacterial effects of traditional chinese medicine monomers against streptococcus pneumoniae via inhibiting pneumococcal histidine kinase (vick).
AB  == two-component systems (tcss) have the potential to be an effective target of the  antimicrobials, and thus received much attention in recent years. vick/vicr is one of tcss in streptococcus pneumoniae (s. pneumoniae), which is essential for pneumococcal survival. we have previously obtained several traditional chinese medicine monomers using a computer-based screening. in this study, either alone or in combination with penicillin, their antimicrobial activities were evaluated  based on in vivo and in vitro assays. the results showed that the mics of 5'-(methylthio)-5'-deoxyadenosine, octanal 2, 4-dinitrophenylhydrazone, deoxyshikonin, kavahin, and dodecyl gallate against s. pneumoniae were 37.1, 38.5, 17, 68.5, and 21 mug/ml, respectively. time-killing assays showed that these compounds elicited bactericidal effects against s. pneumoniae d39 strain, which led to a 6-log reduction in cfu after exposure to compounds at four times of the mic for 24 h. the five compounds inhibited the growth of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans or streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, meanwhile, deoxyshikonin and dodecyl gallate displayed strong inhibitory activities against staphylococcus aureus. these compounds showed no obvious cytotoxicity effects on vero cells. survival time of the mice infected by s. pneumoniae strains was prolonged by the treatment with the compounds. importantly, all of the five compounds exerted antimicrobial effects against multidrug-resistant clinical strains of s. pneumoniae. moreover, even at sub-mic  concentration, they inhibited cell division and biofilm formation. the five compounds all have enhancement effect on penicillin. deoxyshikonin and dodecyl gallate showed significantly synergic antimicrobial activity with penicillin in vivo and in vitro, and effectively reduced nasopharyngeal and lung colonization caused by different penicillin-resistant pneumococcal serotypes. in addition, the two compounds also showed synergic antimicrobial activity with erythromycin and tetracycline. taken together, our results suggest that these novel vick inhibitors may be promising compounds against the pneumococcus, including penicillin-resistant strains.

TI  == oral microbiota shift after 12-week supplementation with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289; a randomized control trial.
AB  == background: lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. methods and findings: oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16s rdna hypervariable region v3-v4 after 12 weeks of daily lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289 consumption. forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 cfu of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). presence of l. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific pcr. tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. a total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. after removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the human oral microbiome database. firmicutes, bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. streptococcus was the most common genus and the s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group comprised the dominant species. the number of observed species was unaffected by l. reuteri exposure. however, subjects who had consumed l. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and pcr detected l. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. l. reuteri intake correlated with increased s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group and campylobacter concisus, granulicatella adiacens, bergeyella sp. hot322, neisseria subflava, and sr1 [g-1] sp. hot874 detection and reduced s. mutans, s. anginosus, n. mucosa, fusobacterium periodicum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, and prevotella maculosa detection. this effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. conclusions: l. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. the biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct02311218.

TI  == functional signatures of oral dysbiosis during periodontitis progression revealed by microbial metatranscriptome analysis.
AB  == background: periodontitis is a polymicrobial biofilm-induced inflammatory disease that affects 743 million people worldwide. the current model to explain periodontitis progression proposes that changes in the relative abundance of members of the oral microbiome lead to dysbiosis in the host-microbiome crosstalk and then to inflammation and bone loss. using combined metagenome/metatranscriptome analysis of the subgingival microbiome in progressing and non-progressing sites, we have characterized the distinct molecular signatures of periodontitis progression. methods: metatranscriptome analysis was conducted on samples from subgingival biofilms from progressing and  stable sites from periodontitis patients. community-wide expression profiles were obtained using next generation sequencing (illumina). sequences were aligned using 'bowtie2' against a constructed oral microbiome database. differential expression analysis was performed using the non-parametric algorithm implemented  on the r package 'noiseqbio'. we summarized global functional activities of the oral microbial community by set enrichment analysis based on the gene ontology (go) orthology. results: gene ontology enrichment analysis showed an over-representation in the baseline of active sites of terms related to cell motility, lipid a and peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and transport of iron, potassium, and amino acids. periodontal pathogens (tannerella forsythia and porphyromonas gingivalis) upregulated different tonb-dependent receptors, peptidases, proteases, aerotolerance genes, iron transport genes, hemolysins, and crispr-associated genes. surprisingly, organisms that have not been usually associated with the disease (streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula, and pseudomonas fluorenscens) were highly active transcribing putative virulence factors. we detected patterns of activities associated with progression of clinical traits. among those we found that the profiles of expression of cobalamin biosynthesis, proteolysis, and potassium transport were associated with the evolution towards disease. conclusions: we identified metabolic changes in the microbial community associated with the initial stages of dysbiosis. regardless of the overall composition of the community, certain metabolic signatures are consistent with disease progression. our results suggest that the  whole community, and not just a handful of oral pathogens, is responsible for an  increase in virulence that leads to progression. trial registration: nct01489839, 6 december 2011.

TI  == effect of probiotic containing ice-cream on salivary mutans streptococci (sms) levels in children of 6-12 years of age: a randomized controlled double blind study with six-months follow up.
AB  == introduction: to evaluate the caries risk based on the salivary levels of streptococcus mutans in children of 6-12 years of age group before and after consuming probiotic ice-cream containing bifidobacterium lactis bb-12 and lactobacillus acidophilus la-5. materials and methods: a double blind, placebo controlled trial was carried out in 60 children aged between 6 to 12 years with zero decayed, missing, and filled teeth (dmft). they were randomly divided into two equal groups. saliva sample were collected before the consumption of ice-cream and streptococcus mutans count was calculated and recorded as baseline  data. for the next seven days both the groups were given ice creams marked as a and b. saliva samples were collected after ice-cream consumption at the end of study period and also after a washout period of 30 days and again after six months. samples were inoculated and colonies were counted. results: on statistical evaluation by students paired t-test, probiotic ice-cream brought significant reduction in the streptococcus mutans count after seven days of ice-cream ingestion (p<0.001) and also after 30 d of washout period (p<0.001). there was no significant reduction (p=0.076) by normal ice-cream consumption. after six months of the study period in both the groups the salivary levels of streptococcus mutans was similar to the baseline. conclusion: probiotic ice-cream containing bifidobacterium lactis bb-12 and lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 can cause reduction in caries causative organism. the dosage of the probiotic organisms for the long term or synergetic effect on the oral health are still needed to be explored.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of chemokine cxcl10 for dermal and oral microorganisms.
AB  == cxcl10 (ip-10) is a small 10 kda chemokine with antimicrobial activity. it is induced by ifn-gamma, chemoattracts mononuclear cells, and promotes adhesion of t cells. recently, we detected cxcl10 on the surface of the skin and in the oral cavity. in the current study, we used broth microdilution and radial diffusion assays to show that cxcl10 inhibits the growth of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, corynebacterium jeikeium, corynebacterium striatum, and candida albicans hmv4c, but not corynebacterium bovis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, poryphromonas gingivalis, or c. albicans atcc 64124. the reason for the selective antimicrobial activity is not yet known. however, antimicrobial activity of cxcl10 may be related to its composition and structure, as a cationic 98 amino acid residue molecule with 10 lysine residues,  7 arginine residues, a total net charge of +11, and a theoretical pi of 9.93. modeling studies revealed that cxcl10 contains an alpha-helix at the n-terminal,  three anti-parallel beta-strands in the middle, and an alpha-helix at the c-terminal. thus, cxcl10, when produced on the surface of the skin or in the oral cavity, likely has antimicrobial activity and may enhance innate antimicrobial and cellular responses to the presence of select commensal or opportunistic microorganisms.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of apitoxin, melittin and phospholipase a(2) of honey bee  (apis mellifera) venom against oral pathogens.
AB  == in this work, we used the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) technique to evaluate the antibacterial potential of the apitoxin produced by apis mellifera bees against the causative agents of tooth decay. apitoxin was assayed in natura  and in the commercially available form. the antibacterial actions of the main components of this apitoxin, phospholipase a2, and melittin were also assessed, alone and in combination. the following bacteria were tested: streptococcus salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, lactobacillus casei,  and enterococcus faecalis. the mic results obtained for the commercially available apitoxin and for the apitoxin in natura were close and lay between 20 and 40 microg / ml, which indicated good antibacterial activity. melittin was the most active component in apitoxin; it displayed very promising mic values, from 4 to 40 microg / ml. phospholipase a2 presented mic values higher than 400 microg / ml. association of mellitin with phospholipase a2 yielded mic values ranging between 6 and 80 microg / ml. considering that tooth decay affects people's health, apitoxin and its component melittin have potential application against oral pathogens.

TI  == antibacterial activity of berry juices, an in vitro study.
AB  == abstract objective. the aim of the present study was to evaluate in vitro antibacterial activities of blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices on bacteria associated with gingival inflammation. materials and methods. the growth of selected bacteria (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa) was studied in vitro on agar plates. the  content of phenols in the different extracts was measured with hplc-esi-ms. results. the spectrometric analysis identified that the highest level of the single phenols studied was found for ferulic acid (113 mug/ml) in blackcurrant juice. sea buckthorn contained low levels of selected phenols. total bacterial inhibition for all bacterial species studied was found at 20% berry juice concentration with ph varying between 4.1-5.4. conclusions. the present study identified that in vitro bacterial growth on agar plates was inhibited by blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices and that low juice ph explains bacterial in vitro growth. this may have clinical implications in biofilm development, reducing the risks for both tooth decay and gingivitis.

TI  == reduction of bacterial adhesion on dental composite resins by silicon-oxygen thin film coatings.
AB  == adhesion of bacteria on dental materials can be reduced by modifying the physical and chemical characteristics of their surfaces, either through the application of specific surface treatments or by the deposition of thin film coatings. since this approach does not rely on the use of drugs or antimicrobial agents embedded  in the materials, its duration is not limited by their possible depletion. moreover it avoids the risks related to possible cytotoxic effects elicited by antibacterial substances released from the surface and diffused in the surrounding tissues. in this work, the adhesion of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus mitis was studied on four composite resins, commonly used for manufacturing dental prostheses. the surfaces of dental materials were modified through the deposition of a-sio(x) thin films by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. the chemical bonding structure of the coatings was analyzed by fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. the morphology of the dental materials before and after the coating deposition was assessed by means of optical microscopy and high-resolution mechanical profilometry, while their wettability was investigated by contact angle measurements. the sample roughness was not altered after coating deposition, while a noticeable increase of wettability was  detected for all the samples. also, the adhesion of s. mitis decreased in a statistically significant way on the coated samples, when compared to the uncoated ones, which did not occur for s. mutans. within the limitations of this  study, a-sio(x) coatings may affect the adhesion of bacteria such as s. mitis, possibly by changing the wettability of the composite resins investigated.

TI  == role of aqueous extract of morinda citrifolia (indian noni) ripe fruits in inhibiting dental caries-causing streptococcus mutans and streptococcus mitis.
AB  == objectives: use of alternative medicine to control oral streptococci is a new topic worthy of further investigation. this study aimed to elucidate the dose-dependent anti-bacterial activity of crude aqueous extract of ripe morinda citrifolia l. (family: rubiaceae) fruits against oral streptococci i.e. streptococcus mutans and streptococcus mitis, that cause dental caries in humans. methods: fresh ripe m. citrifolia fruits (750g) were ground in an electronic blender with sterile water (500ml). the crude aqueous extract was lyophilized to  yield a brown colored powder. various concentrations (1000-100mug/ ml) of the extract were tested for its antibacterial activity (kirby and bauer method) against whole cells of s. mutans and s. mitis. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined by micro-dilution method, using serially diluted (2 folds) fruit extract, according to the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls). results: crude aqueous extract (1000mug/ ml) of ripe m. citrifolia fruits effectively inhibited the growth of s. mutans (19+/-0.5 mm) and s. mitis (18.6+/-0.3 mm) compared to the streptomycin control (21.6+/-0.3 mm). the growth inhibition was clearly evident with "nil" bacteriostasis, even after 48 hours of incubation at 37 degrees c. the mic of the extract for s. mutans and  s. mitis was 125 mug and 62.5 mug, respectively. conclusion: our results suggest  that phytochemicals naturally synthesized by m. citrifolia have an inhibitory effect on oral streptococci. furthermore, purification and molecular characterization of the "bioactive principle" would enable us to formulate a sustainable oral hygiene product.

TI  == comparison of species identification of endocarditis associated viridans streptococci using rnpb genotyping and 2 maldi-tof systems.
AB  == streptococcus spp. are important causes of infective endocarditis but challenging in species identification. this study compared identification based on sequence determination of the rnpb gene with 2 systems of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, maldi biotyper (bruker) and vitek ms ivd (biomerieux). blood culture isolates of viridans streptococci from 63 patients with infective endocarditis were tested. the 3 methods showed full agreement for all 36 isolates identified in the anginosus, bovis, and mutans groups or identified as streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, or streptococcus sanguinis. none of the methods could reliably identify the 23 isolates to the species level when designated as streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, or streptococcus tigurinus. in 7 isolates classified to the mitis group, the rnpb sequences deviated strikingly from all reference sequences, and additional analysis of soda and groel genes indicated the occurrence of yet unidentified streptococcus spp.

TI  == recolonization of mutans streptococci after application of chlorhexidine gel.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is specifically suppressed by intensive treatment with chlorhexidine gel, but the time for recolonization and the effect on other oral bacteria are not totally clear. in this study, recolonization of mutans streptococci was evaluated in nine healthy adult volunteers, who were highly colonized with this microorganism. stimulated saliva was collected before (baseline) and at 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after application of 1% chlorhexidine  gel on volunteers' teeth for two consecutive days. on each day, the gel was applied using disposable trays for 3 x 5 min with intervals of 5 min between each application. saliva was plated on blood agar to determine total microorganisms (tm); on mitis salivarius agar to determine total streptococci (ts) and on mitis  salivarius agar plus bacitracin to determine mutans streptococci (ms). chlorhexidine was capable of reducing the counts of ms and the proportion of ms with regard to total microorganisms (%ms/tm) (p<0.05), but these values did not differ statistically from baseline (p>0.05) after 14 days for ms and 21 days for  %ms/tm. the counts of tm and ts and the proportion of ms to total streptococci did not differ statistically from baseline (p>0.05) after chlorhexidine treatment. the results suggest that the effect of chlorhexidine gel treatment on  suppression of mutans streptococci is limited to less than a month in highly colonized individuals.

TI  == cariogenic bacteria and dental health status in adolescents: the role of oral health behaviours.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the association between dental health status and levels of cariogenic bacteria in teenagers and the influence of behaviours and socio-demographic background on levels of bacteria. materials and methods: study  design: a cross-sectional population-based sample of 13-year-old adolescents (112 females and 78 males, total 190) was examined. the number of decayed, missing and filled surfaces (dmfs), plaque and hygiene index were recorded according to the who criteria. the saliva samples were collected in a sterile container and then analysed by culture on mitis salivarius bacitracin (msb) agar for mutans streptococci and on man rogosa sharp (mrs) agar for lactobacilli. the levels of bacteria were expressed as the number of colonies forming units per millilitre of saliva (cfu/ml). associations between levels of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and dental health were estimated by odds ratio (or) and 95% confidence interval (95% ci) using unconditional logistic regression. results: no mutans streptococci were detected in 53.2% of the adolescents but 22.6% presented >/= 10(3) cfu/ml. for lactobacilli, these values were, respectively 43.7% and 34.7%. after adjustment for gender and social class, the or (95% ci) for dmfs >5  was 8.66 (3.57-21.02) if mutans streptococci >/= 10(3) cfu and 2.11 (0.96-4.64) if lactobacilli >/= 10(3) cfu. conclusion: this data allow us to conclude that hygiene habits and dental visits are not associated with high levels of cariogenic bacteria, but high scores of dmfs were found in adolescents with high  levels of mutans streptococci and lower parents' education.

TI  == salivary antibody response to streptococci in preterm and fullterm children: a prospective study.
AB  == objectives: secretory immunoglobulins present in mucosa surfaces represent the first line of defense of the adaptive immune system against infectious challenges. preterm (pt) neonates' humoral immunity is diminished compared to full-term (ft) newborns. the identification of important antigens (ags) of virulence of oral species may help in the investigation of the mechanisms of antigenic stimulation and the development of the mucosal immune response. in the  present study, we measured saliva levels of immunoglobulins a (iga) and m (igm) and characterized the specificity of iga against ags of several streptococcal species found early in life. methods: this was a prospective observational study. salivary iga (siga) antibody responses to bacterial species that are prototypes of pioneer (streptococcus mitis, s. sanguinis, s. gordonii) and pathogenic (streptococcus mutans) microorganisms of the oral cavity were studied in ft and pt children in two visits: at birth (t0) and at 3 months of age (t3). salivas from 123 infants (72 ft and 51 pt) were collected during the first 10h after birth (t0) and again at 3 months of age (t3). salivary levels of iga and igm antibodies were analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). a subgroup of 26 ft and 24 pt children were compared with respect to patterns of antibody specificities against different streptococci ags using western blot assays. results: no significant differences (p>0.05) in salivary levels of iga and igm between ft and pt babies were found at birth. at t3, mean siga values were similar between groups and sigm levels were significantly higher in pt than ft (p<0.05). western blot assays identified positive iga response to streptococci in the majority of children, especially in the ft group. there were some differences between groups in relation to the frequency of children with positive response to ags and intensity of iga response. in general, oral streptococci ags were more frequently detected and bands were more intense in ft than in pt, especially in t3. prospective analysis of patterns of siga against ags of different streptococcal species revealed an increase in complexity of the siga antibody response from the first day of birth (t0) to t3 in pt and ft. conclusion: the patterns of siga response to streptococci ags appear to be influenced by the gestational age, which might reflect the level of immunological maturity of the mucosal immune system.

TI  == levels and complexity of iga antibody against oral bacteria in samples of human colostrum.
AB  == streptococcus mutans (sm) have three main virulence antigens: glucan binding protein b (gbpb), glucosyltransferase (gtf) and antigens i/ii (ag i/ii) envolved  in the capacity of those bacteria to adhere and accumulate in the dental biofilm. also, the glycosyltransferases 153 kda of streptococcus gordonii (sgo) and 170kda of streptococcus sanguinis (ssa) were important antigens associated with the accumulation of those bacterias. streptococcus mitis (smi) present iga1 protease  of 202 kda. we investigated the specificity and levels iga against those antigens of virulence in samples of human colostrum. this study involved 77 samples of colostrum that were analyzed for levels of immunoglobulian a, m and g by elisa. the specificity of iga against extracts of sm and initials colonizators (ssa, smi, sgo) were analyzed by the western blot. the mean concentration of iga was 2850.2 (+/-2567.2) mg/100 ml followed by igm and igg (respectively 321.8+/-90.3 and 88.3+/-51.5), statistically different (p<0.05). results showed that the majority of samples had detectable levels of iga antibodies to extracts of bacteria antigens and theirs virulence antigens. to sm, the gbpb was significantly lower detected than others antigens of sm (p<0.05). high complexities of response to ags were identified in the samples. there were no significant differences in the mean number of iga-reactive ags between the antigens (p>0.4). so, the breast milk from first hours after birth presented significant levels of iga specific against important virulence of antigens those  oral streptococci, which can disrupt the installation and accumulation process of these microorganisms in the oral cavity.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of the triterpene 3beta,6beta,16beta-trihydroxylup-20(29)-ene on planktonic cells and biofilms from gram positive and gram negative bacteria.
AB  == this study evaluated the antimicrobial effect of 3beta,6beta,16beta-trihydroxylup-20(29)-ene (clf1), a triterpene isolated from combretum leprosum mart., in inhibiting the planktonic growth and biofilms of gram positive bacteria streptococcus mutans and s. mitis. the antimicrobial activity was assessed by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc). the antibiofilm potential was determined by quantifying total biomass and enumerating biofilm-entrapped viable  bacteria. in addition, the acute toxicity of clf1 on artemia sp. nauplii was also determined. the results showed that clf1 was able in inhibiting the growth of s.  mutans and s. mitis with mic and mbc of 7.8 mug/ml and 15.6 mug/ml, respectively. clf1 was highly effective on biofilms of both bacteria. only 7.8 mug/ml clf1 was  enough to inhibit by 97% and 90% biomass production of s. mutans and s. mitis, respectively. on the other hand, such effects were not evident on gram negative pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella oxytoca. the toxicity tests showed that the lc50 of clf1 was 98.19 mug/ml. therefore, clf1 isolated from c. leprosum may constitute an important natural agent for the development of new therapies for caries and other infectious diseases caused by s. mutans and s. mitis.

TI  == comparative genomics of the bacterial genus streptococcus illuminates evolutionary implications of species groups.
AB  == members of the genus streptococcus within the phylum firmicutes are among the most diverse and significant zoonotic pathogens. this genus has gone through considerable taxonomic revision due to increasing improvements of chemotaxonomic  approaches, dna hybridization and 16s rrna gene sequencing. it is proposed to place the majority of streptococci into "species groups". however, the evolutionary implications of species groups are not clear presently. we use comparative genomic approaches to yield a better understanding of the evolution of streptococcus through genome dynamics, population structure, phylogenies and virulence factor distribution of species groups. genome dynamics analyses indicate that the pan-genome size increases with the addition of newly sequenced  strains, while the core genome size decreases with sequential addition at the genus level and species group level. population structure analysis reveals two distinct lineages, one including pyogenic, bovis, mutans and salivarius groups, and the other including mitis, anginosus and unknown groups. phylogenetic dendrograms show that species within the same species group cluster together, and infer two main clades in accordance with population structure analysis. distribution of streptococcal virulence factors has no obvious patterns among the species groups; however, the evolution of some common virulence factors is congruous with the evolution of species groups, according to phylogenetic inference. we suggest that the proposed streptococcal species groups are reasonable from the viewpoints of comparative genomics; evolution of the genus is congruent with the individual evolutionary trajectories of different species groups.

AB  == fermented papaya preparation (fpp) is a "natural health product." the high incidence of dental caries, gingivitis, periodontitis, and oral microbial infection cases among patients with diabetes mellitus continues to prevail. the potential role of fpp against common oral microbiota (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, and lactobacillus acidophilus) isolated from the human oral  cavity was investigated using in vitro simulation models of dental plaque and caries. fpp showed an inhibitory effect against the growth (at 0.05 mg/ml: s. mutans: -6.9%; s. mitis: -4.47%, p < 0.05), acid production (at 0.05 mg/ml: s. mutans: +6.38%; l. acidophilus: +2.25%), and hydrophobicity (at 50 mg/ml: s. mutans: 1.01%, p < 0.01; s. mitis: 7.66%, p < 0.05) of tested microbiota. the results of this study suggest that low doses of fpp may be a suitable complement  to good oral hygiene practice for the effective prevention of dental caries, plaque, and gingivitis. the functional application of fpp as a constituent of a balanced diet and active lifestyle can make a positive contribution to the oral health status and well-being of patients with diabetes.

TI  == composition and activity against oral pathogens of the essential oil of melampodium divaricatum (rich.) dc.
AB  == the chemical composition of the essential oil isolated from the aerial parts of melampodium divaricatum (rich.) dc. (asteraceae) was characterized by gc-fid and  gc/ms analyses. (e)-caryophyllene (56.0%), germacrene d (12.7%), and bicyclogermacrene (9.2%) were identified as the major oil components. the antimicrobial activity of the oil against seven standard strains of oral pathogens from the american type culture collection (atcc) was evaluated by determining minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) using the microdilution method. mic values below 100 mug/ml were obtained against streptococcus sobrinus  (90 mug/ml), lactobacillus casei (30 mug/ml), s. mutans (20 mug/ml), and s. mitis (18 mug/ml). in contrast, the mic values of the major oil compound (e)-caryophyllene were higher than 400 mug/ml against all pathogens, suggesting that the activity of the oil might depend on minor oil components and/or on synergistic effects. the m. divaricatum essential oil is a promising agent to include in anticariogenic oral rinse formulations for the control of oral pathogens.

TI  == caries experience, mutans streptococci and total protein concentrations in children with protein-energy undernutrition.
AB  == background: the highest prevalence of protein-energy undernutrition is observed during early childhood, being also a time in which the presence of dental caries  can be unusually aggressive. the present study aimed to verify if different levels of undernutrition could influence the risk of early childhood caries (ecc), in the presence of other predisposing factors. methods: one hundred and twenty undernourished 12-70 month old children, with or without ecc, were selected. undernourished children were classified as being mildly, moderately or  severely undernourished. all children were examined for determination of decayed, missing and filled surfaces (dmfs). total protein concentration in saliva was analysed by the bradford method. for microbiological analysis, mitis salivarius-bacitracin agar medium was used. a binary logistic regression model was applied to test the simultaneous influence of different variables over caries experience. results: the risk of ecc was significantly higher with an increase in age (p = 0.000) and mutans streptococci counts (p = 0.032). comparisons with the  normal-weight group showed that mildly (p = 0.004) and severely undernourished children (p = 0.037) had a higher risk of experiencing ecc, but this risk was not significantly elevated among moderately undernourished children (p = 0.158). conclusions: our results suggest that mildly and severely undernourished children have an increased risk of experiencing dental caries. age is highly associated with the disease in this population.

TI  == [evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
AB  == introduction: antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (snp's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for  therapeutic purposes. it is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal snp's  possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of snp's against cariogenic bacteria: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis  responsible for initiation of dental carries. tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. nanotechnology creates a  new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. methods: colloidal silver solution (css) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were  evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis and s, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs  of 7 patients treated for dental carries at department of conservative dentistry, medical university of warsaw. mic and mbc values for css's were evaluated. results: css used in this research is of good stability. no agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. mic values were: 12-25 ppm for s. salivarius, 25 ppm for s. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for s. mitis and 50 ppm for s. mutans, while mbc values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. after 24 hours of contact  mbc values were: 25-50 ppm for s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for s. mitis and 200 ppmfor s. mutans. conclusions: antimicrobial properties of css depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. the susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in  our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.

TI  == adhesion forces and composition of planktonic and adhering oral microbiomes.
AB  == the oral microbiome consists of a planktonic microbiome residing in saliva and an adhering microbiome (the biofilm adhering to oral hard and soft tissues). here we hypothesized that possible differences in microbial composition of the planktonic and adhering oral microbiome on teeth can be related to the forces by which different bacterial species are attracted to the tooth surface. the relative presence of 7 oral bacterial species in saliva and biofilm collected from 10 healthy human volunteers was determined twice in each volunteer by denaturing-gradient-gel electrophoresis. analysis of both microbiomes showed complete separation of the planktonic from the adhering oral microbiome. next, adhesion forces of corresponding bacterial strains with saliva-coated enamel surfaces were measured by atomic force microscopy. species that were found predominantly in the adhering microbiome had significantly higher adhesion forces to saliva-coated enamel (-0.60 to -1.05 nn) than did species mostly present in the planktonic microbiome (-0.40 to -0.55 nn). it is concluded that differences in composition of the planktonic and the adhering oral microbiome are due to small differences in the forces by which strains adhere to saliva-coated enamel,  providing an important step in understanding site- and material-specific differences in the composition of biofilms in the oral cavity.

TI  == a tissue-dependent hypothesis of dental caries.
AB  == current understanding of dental caries considers this disease a demineralization  of the tooth tissues due to the acid produced by sugar-fermenting microorganisms. thus, caries is considered a diet- and ph-dependent process. we present here the  first metagenomic analysis of the bacterial communities present at different stages of caries development, with the aim of determining whether the bacterial composition and biochemical profile are specific to the tissue affected. the data show that microbial composition at the initial, enamel-affecting stage of caries  is significantly different from that found at subsequent stages, as well as from  dental plaque of sound tooth surfaces. although the relative proportion of streptococcus mutans increased from 0.12% in dental plaque to 0.72% in enamel caries, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguinis were the dominant streptococci in these lesions. the functional profile of caries-associated bacterial communities indicates that genes involved in acid stress tolerance and  dietary sugar fermentation are overrepresented only at the initial stage (enamel  caries), whereas other genes coding for osmotic stress tolerance as well as collagenases and other proteases enabling dentin degradation are significantly overrepresented in dentin cavities. the results support a scenario in which ph and diet are determinants of the disease during the degradation of enamel, but in dentin caries lesions not only acidogenic but also proteolytic bacteria are involved. we propose that caries disease is a process of varying etiology, in which acid-producing bacteria are the vehicle to penetrate enamel and allow dentin degrading microorganisms to expand the cavity.

TI  == the effect of a silver nanoparticle polysaccharide system on streptococcal and saliva-derived biofilms.
AB  == in this work, we studied the antimicrobial properties of a nanocomposite system based on a lactose-substituted chitosan and silver nanoparticles: chitlac-nag. twofold serial dilutions of the colloidal chitlac-nag solution were both tested on streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus oralis planktonic phase and biofilm growth mode as well as on saliva samples. the minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of chitlac-nag were evaluated together with its effect on sessile cell viability, as well as both on biofilm formation and on preformed biofilm. in respect to the planktonic bacteria, chitlac-nag showed an inhibitory/bactericidal effect against all streptococcal strains at 0.1% (v/v), except for s. mitis atcc 6249 that was inhibited at one step less. on preformed biofilm, chitlac-nag at a value of 0.2%, was able to inhibit the bacterial growth on the supernatant phase as well as on the mature biofilm. for s. mitis atcc 6249, the biofilm inhibitory concentration of chitlac-nag was 0.1%. at sub-inhibitory concentrations, the streptococcal strains adhesion capability on a polystyrene surface showed a general reduction following a concentration-dependent-way; a similar effect was obtained for the metabolic biofilm activity. from these results, chitlac-nag seems to be a promising antibacterial and antibiofilm agent able to hinder plaque formation.

TI  == revealing anti-cariogenic efficacy of smokeless tobacco: a pilot study.
AB  == background: the tobacco plant, nicotiana tabacum, has been responsible for more deaths than any other herb. however, the literature has also been endowed with its use as "holy herb" since the pre-columbian era. used for treating pain, poisonous bites, ulcers, nasal polyps, and basal cell carcinoma; it also acts as  an important ingredient of commercially available toothpastes; and even used as tobacco vaccines against streptococcus species as highlighted in the literature.  aims and objectives: (1) to elicit the anti-microbial property of tobacco against streptococcus mutans, if any, in raw smokeless tobacco. (2) to study the relationship of duration and growth inhibition efficacy of smokeless tobacco. materials and methods: extracts were prepared by centrifugation of mixed raw smokeless tobacco with ringer's lactate solution and with saliva. the extracts were placed in wells prepared on mitis salivarius culture plate and incubated at  37 degrees c for 24 h after 0 h, 1 h, and 2 h of extract preparation. the inhibition zones were measured on the underside of plate using the vernier calipers. results: smokeless tobacco has a statistically significant zone of inhibition, which proves its anti-microbial activity against s. mutans. however,  the mean zones of inhibition were greater for ringer's lactate and tobacco group  as compared to test samples (saliva and tobacco) with subsequent reduction of inhibition zones with an increase in duration. conclusion: the anti-microbial property of extensive tobacco resources can be utilized from their extracts in order to balance the deterioration it had caused to mankind.

TI  == pontic morphology as local risk factor in root decay and periodontal disease.
AB  == introduction: in absence of treatment, old single edentulous spaces are subjected to progressively decrease in length due to tilting and rotation of the teeth situated mesial and distal. lately when these spaces are prosthetically restored  with a bridge and these teeth are becoming abutments, sanitizing of the prosthetic restoration is achieved with difficulty, the space between the pontic  and the gingival surface becoming an area rich in pathogens that can cause various complications on the abutments. aim: considering these aspects, in this study we wanted to highlight the presence and the types of the microorganisms that can be found under the pontic even in an ideal situation, selecting only young adult patients with a good oral hygiene and only with metal-ceramic bridges. materials and methods: determination of microorganisms was achieved by growing on bd columbia agar with 5% sheep blood. incubation was done in anaerobe  condition using genbag system produced by biomerieux company. results: the microorganisms that we determined were streptococcus mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, gram-negative bacilli (bacteroides ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron) and gram-positive bacilli (bifidobacterium spp., actinomyces israelii, clostridium butyricum / beijerinckii) with relevance in the carious and periodontal disease. conclusions: in cases of single unit bridges with very narrow pontics, even in patients with a very good oral hygiene and metal-ceramic restorations, we can still find micro-organisms that can potentially generate decay or periodontal disease on the abutments, located in the gingival area underneath these pontics. these bacteria  can have negative implications on the long-term prognosis of prosthetic restorations.

TI  == effects of short-chain fatty acids on actinomyces naeslundii biofilm formation.
AB  == actinomyces naeslundii is an early colonizer and has important roles in the development of the oral biofilm. short-chain fatty acids (scfa) are secreted extracellularly as a product of metabolism by gram-negative anaerobes, e.g. porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum; and the scfa may affect biofilm development with interaction between a. naeslundii and gram-negative bacteria. our aim was to investigate the effects of scfa on biofilm formation by  a. naeslundii and to determine the mechanism. we used the biofilm formation assay in 96-well microtiter plates in tryptic soy broth without dextrose and with 0.25% sucrose using safranin stain of the biofilm monitoring 492 nm absorbance. to determine the mechanism by scfa, the production of chaperones and stress-response proteins (grpe and groel) in biofilm formation was examined using western blot fluorescence activity with grpe and groel antibodies. adding butyric acid (6.25 mm) 0, 6 and 10 h after beginning culture significantly increased biofilm formation by a. naeslundii, and upregulation was observed at 16 h. upregulation was also observed using appropriate concentrations of other scfa. in the upregulated biofilm, production of grpe and groel was higher where membrane-damaged or dead cells were also observed. the upregulated biofilm was significantly reduced by addition of anti-groel antibody. the data suggest biofilm formation by a. naeslundii was upregulated dependent on the production of stress proteins, and addition of scfa increased membrane-damaged or dead cells. production of groel may physically play an important role in biofilm development.

TI  == colonization of streptococcus mutans on esthetic brackets: self-ligating vs conventional.
AB  == introduction: self-ligating orthodontic brackets rely on clips, rather than ligatures, to hold the archwire in place. it is unknown whether replacing ligatures with clips affects the adherence of streptococcus mutans. the aim of this research was to evaluate whether self-ligating brackets have an advantage over conventional brackets as determined by the adherence of s mutans. methods: the sample consisted of 50 esthetic brackets, divided into 3 experimental groups  and 2 control groups of 10 brackets each. two experimental groups were active self-ligating brackets (quicklear; forestadent, pforzheim, germany; and in-ovation c; dentsply gac, bohemia, ny); the other was a passive self-ligating bracket (damon 3; ormco, glendora, calif). the 2 control groups were conventional brackets (mystique; dentsply gac; and clarity; 3m unitek, monrovia, calif). the brackets were randomly bonded to the canines, first and second premolars, and first and second molars in the mandibular left hemiarch of 10 male participants.  biofilm was collected from the tooth surfaces before bonding and from the brackets on day 21 and placed in petri dishes containing mitis salivarius agar. the brackets were removed on day 28 and examined by using scanning electron microscopy. statistical analysis, analysis of variance, and the tukey correction  with a p value of 0.05 were used. results: the greatest numbers of colonies were  found in an active self-ligating bracket group (in-ovation c), and the fewest colonies were in a conventional bracket group (clarity). the largest colonies formed on active self-ligating brackets. in the slot, the greatest formation was  in a control group (mystique). conclusions: self-ligating esthetic brackets do not promote greater or lesser s mutans colonization when compared with conventional brackets. differences were found to be related to the material composition of the bracket.

TI  == early in vitro and in vivo development of high-level daptomycin resistance is common in mitis group streptococci after exposure to daptomycin.
AB  == the development of high-level daptomycin resistance (hldr; mic of >/= 256 mg/liter) after exposure to daptomycin has recently been reported in viridans group streptococcus (vgs) isolates. our study objectives were as follows: to know whether in vitro development of hldr after exposure to daptomycin was common among clinical isolates of vgs and streptococcus bovis; to determine whether hldr also developed during the administration of daptomycin to treat experimental endocarditis caused by the daptomycin-susceptible, penicillin-resistant streptococcus mitis strain s. mitis 351; and to establish whether combination with gentamicin prevented the development of hldr in vitro and in vivo. in vitro  studies were performed with 114 vgs strains (mitis group, 92; anginosus group, 10; mutans group, 8; and salivarius group, 4) and 54 streptococcus bovis strains  isolated from 168 consecutive patients with infective endocarditis diagnosed between 1995 and 2010. hldr was only observed after 24 h of exposure to daptomycin in 27% of the mitis group, including 27% of s. mitis isolates, 47% of  s. oralis isolates, and 13% of s. sanguis isolates. in our experimental model, hldr was detected in 7/11 (63%) and 8/12 (67%) isolates recovered from vegetations after 48 h of daptomycin administered at 6 mg/kg of body weight/24 h  and 10 mg/kg/24 h, respectively. in vitro, time-kill experiments showed that daptomycin plus gentamicin was bactericidal against s. mitis 351 at tested concentrations of 0.5 and 1 times the mic and prevented the development of hldr.  in vivo, the addition of gentamicin at 1 mg/kg/8 h to both daptomycin arms prevented hldr in 21 out of 23 (91%) rabbits. daptomycin plus gentamicin was at least as effective as vancomycin plus gentamicin. in conclusion, hldr develops rapidly and frequently in vitro and in vivo among mitis group streptococci. combining daptomycin with gentamicin enhanced its activity and prevented the development of hldr in most cases.

TI  == in-vitro activity of saponins of bauhinia purpurea, madhuca longifolia, celastrus paniculatus and semecarpus anacardium on selected oral pathogens.
AB  == objective: dental caries, periodontitis and other mucosal diseases are caused by  a complex community of microorganisms. this study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial properties of saponins of four important oil yielding medicinal plant extracts on selected oral pathogens that are involved in such diseases. materials and methods: saponins were extracted from bauhinia purpurea, madhuca longifolia, celastrus paniculatus and semecarpus anacardium and purified. antimicrobial properties of these saponins against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, staphylococcus aureus and lactobacillus acidophilus were determined using well diffusion method. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined as the lowest concentration of saponins inhibiting bacterial growth after 14 h of incubation at 37 degrees c. the bactericidal activity was evaluated using the viable cell count method. results: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of madhuca longifolia saponin on streptococcus mutans mtcc 890, streptococcus mitis and staphylococcus aureus was 18.3 +/- 0.15/34.4 +/- 0.24 mug/ml, 19.0 +/- 0.05/32.2 +/- 0.0 mug/ml and 21.2 +/- 0.35/39.0 +/- 0.30 mug/ml, respectively and bauhinia purpurea saponin on streptococcus mutans mtcc 890, staphylococcus aureus and lactobacillus acidophilus was 26.4 +/- 0.20/43.0 +/- 0.40 mug/ml, 29.0 +/- 0.30/39.6 +/- 0.12 mug/ml and 20.2 +/- 0.05/36.8 +/- 0.23 mug/ml, respectively. conclusion: the strong antimicrobial activity of madhuca longifolia and bauhinia purpurea may be due to the presence of complex triterpenoid saponins, oleanane type triterpenoid glycosides or atypical pentacyclic triterpenoid saponin. hence, these extracted saponins may be used in  food and oral products to prevent and control oral diseases.

TI  == enantiomeric hplc resolution and absolute stereochemistry assignment of a new poligamain derivative.
AB  == a new aryltetralin lignan derivative, 1, was obtained by reacting dimethyl succinate and piperonal, furnishing the lactone 4-(3',4'-methylenedioxybenzyl)-4,5-dihydro-2(3h)-furanone, which was reacted once again with piperonal and lda to give the dibenzylbutirolactone 7-hydroxyhinokinin. the cyclization of 7-hydroxyhinokinin into polygamain occurred in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid. the reduction of the furanic ring of polygamain was done by its reaction with dibal in thf, furnishing the diol functionalized lignin derivative 1 as single diastereomer. the enantiomeric  fractions of 1 were obtained by preparative enantioselective hplc. the absolute stereochemistry was assigned by electronic circular dichroism (ecd) and nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy. an all-trans relative configuration was determined by nmr on the bases of (1)h coupling constants and nuclear overhauser  effect (n.o.e.) experiments. the absolute configuration at c1 was assigned on the basis of the ecd sign at 296 nm by comparison to the ecd spectra of structural analogues with defined stereochemistry. the assignment of the absolute configuration was confirmed by applying the exciton chirality method to the well-defined ecd couplets at 285 and 200 nm allied to the two electronic transitions l(b) and b(b) of the aromatic moieties, respectively. rac-1 and its enantiomeric isomers were evaluated against important bacteria responsible for dental caries. the best results obtained for the (1r,2s,3s) isomer were against streptococcus mutans (250 mum), streptococcus salivarius (250 mum), streptococcus sobrinus (280 mum) and streptococcus mitis (280 mum). the (1s,2r,3r) isomer was active only against streptococcus sanguinis (280 mum). the enantiomeric mixture was less active than the (1r,2s,3s) isomer.

TI  == comparative study on the microbial adhesion to preveneered and stainless steel crowns.
AB  == context: the extensive plaque formation on dental restorations may contribute to  secondary caries or periodontal inflammation. therefore, it is important to know  how different types of dental restorations may prevent or promote the accumulation of microorganisms. aims: the aim of this in vivo study was to evaluate the adhesion of streptococcus mutans to preveneered and stainless steel  crowns (sscs) and to evaluate the effects of these restorations on the gingival health and oral hygiene. materials and methods: twenty patients (age 3-5 years) were selected from the outpatient clinic of the pedodontics department, faculty of oral and dental medicine, cairo university. the selected patients had (dmf) index for primary dentition </=4, including lower right and left first primary molars. each tooth was pulpotomy-treated and restored with either type of crowns  (split-mouth technique). then, ten swabs from the buccal mucosa, preveneered crown, and ssc surfaces were taken from each patient. also, the gingival index (gi) and oral hygiene index (ohi-s) were measured at different times during the study. mitis salivarius bacitracin agar (msba) was used as a selective medium for s. mutans growth. msba plates were taken in candle jar and incubated aerobically  in 37 degrees c for 48 h. finally, bacteria were counted and expressed in colony  forming unit (cfu). results: after 1, 2, and 4 weeks, mucosa and crown swabs of preveneered crown showed statistically significant higher mean cfu counts than ssc. through the whole study period, the two restorations revealed a statistically significant decrease in mean cfu counts. also, there was a statistically significant positive (direct) correlation between ohi-s, gi, and s. mutans counts on both restorations. conclusions: the adhesion of s. mutans to preveneered crowns was higher than to ssc. full mouth rehabilitation led to significant decrease in s. mutans count in the short term. an increase in s. mutans counts is associated with an increase in ohi-s and gi.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of selected essential oils against cariogenic bacteria.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of nine selected essential oils (eos) against a panel  of oral pathogens was investigated in terms of their minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) by using the broth microdilution method. most of the eos displayed weak activity or were inactive against the selected oral pathogens, with mic values ranging from 500 to 4000 mug/ml. however, the eo obtained from the leaves of bidens sulphurea (asteraceae) was found to display moderate activity against streptococcus mutans (mic = 250 mug/ml) and significant activity against streptococcus mitis (mic = 31.25 mug/ml). germacrene d (38.3%), trans-caryophyllene (18.0%), beta-elemene (13.9%) and bicyclogermacrene (13.1%) were identified as the main chemical components of this oil. 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol, previously described as the major constituent in the eo from the flowers of b. sulphurea, was not detected in this study.

TI  == recovery of mutans streptococci on msb, sb-20 and sb-20m agar media.
AB  == objective: the recovery of mutans streptococci in saliva and dental biofilm samples depends, in part, on the culture medium used. in this study, we compared  (i) the culture media sucrose-bacitracin agar (sb-20), modified sb-20 (sb-20m) and mitis salivarius bacitracin agar (msb) in the count of colony forming units (cfu) of mutans streptococci and (ii) in the morphological and biochemical differentiation between streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus. design:  samples of non-stimulated saliva from 20 children were plated on sb-20, sb-20m and msb, and incubated in microaerophilia at 37 degrees c for 72h. identification of microorganisms was based on analysis of colony morphology under stereomicroscopy. the biochemical identification of colonies was done by biochemical tests using sugar fermentation, resistance to bacitracin and hydrogen peroxide production. results: there was no significant difference (p>0.05) in the number of cfu of mutans streptococci recovered on sb-20 and sb-20m agar. comparing the media, sb-20 and sb-20m yielded a larger number of mutans streptococci colonies (p<0.05) and were more effective than msb in the identification of s. sobrinus (p<0.05), but not of s. mutans (p>0.05). conclusion: there was no significant difference between sb-20 and sb-20m culture  media in the count of mutans streptococci, demonstrating that the replacement of  sucrose by coarse granular cane sugar did not alter the efficacy of the medium. compared with msb, sb-20 and sb-20m allowed counting a larger number of mutans streptococci colonies and a more effective morphological identification of s. sobrinus.

TI  == beyond streptococcus mutans: dental caries onset linked to multiple species by 16s rrna community analysis.
AB  == dental caries in very young children may be severe, result in serious infection,  and require general anesthesia for treatment. dental caries results from a shift  within the biofilm community specific to the tooth surface, and acidogenic species are responsible for caries. streptococcus mutans, the most common acid producer in caries, is not always present and occurs as part of a complex microbial community. understanding the degree to which multiple acidogenic species provide functional redundancy and resilience to caries-associated communities will be important for developing biologic interventions. in addition, microbial community interactions in health and caries pathogenesis are not well understood. the purpose of this study was to investigate bacterial community profiles associated with the onset of caries in the primary dentition. in a combination cross-sectional and longitudinal design, bacterial community profiles at progressive stages of caries and over time were examined and compared to those of health. 16s rrna gene sequencing was used for bacterial community analysis. streptococcus mutans was the dominant species in many, but not all, subjects with caries. elevated levels of s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, and s. parasanguinis were  also associated with caries, especially in subjects with no or low levels of s. mutans, suggesting these species are alternative pathogens, and that multiple species may need to be targeted for interventions. veillonella, which metabolizes lactate, was associated with caries and was highly correlated with total acid producing species. among children without previous history of caries, veillonella, but not s. mutans or other acid-producing species, predicted future  caries. bacterial community diversity was reduced in caries as compared to health, as many species appeared to occur at lower levels or be lost as caries advanced, including the streptococcus mitis group, neisseria, and streptococcus sanguinis. this may have implications for bacterial community resilience and the  restoration of oral health.

TI  == effect of xylitol on cariogenic and beneficial oral streptococci: a randomized, double-blind crossover trial.
AB  == background/purpose: although habitual consumption of xylitol reduces cariogenic streptococci levels, its effect on beneficial oral streptococci is less clear. the main aim of the study is to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the oral beneficial streptococci level of saliva, streptococcus sanguinis and s. mitis. material and methods: twenty four volunteers with a median age of 23.7 years (range: 20-28) harboring streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, s. sanguinis and s. mitis participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. the experimental chewing gum (1.5 g/pellet) contained 70% xylitol w/w while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol w/w. saliva samples were collected before and after two three-week test periods with a four-week washout interval. colony-forming units (cfu)/ml were enumerated for the estimation of s.  mutans levels on mitis salivarius-mutans valinomycin (ms-mutv), s. sobrinus on mitis salivarius-sobrinus (ms-sob), s. sanguinis on modified medium 10-sucrose (mm10-s) and s. mitis on mitis salivarius agar with tellurite (msat) media. results: the s. mutans and s. sobrinus counts of the saliva samples decreased significantly (p = 0.01 and p = 0.011, respectively) in the xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. the salivary s. sanguinis and s. mitis counts did  not decrease in both xylitol and sorbitol gum groups. conclusions: based on the findings of this study, xylitol consumption reduced s. mutans and s. sobrinus counts in saliva but appeared not to effect numbers of s. sanguinis and s. mitis  in saliva. so, habitual consumption of xylitol reduces cariogenic streptococci levels without any effect on beneficial sterptococci for the oral cavity.

TI  == salivary proteins promote proteolytic activity in streptococcus mitis biovar 2 and streptococcus mutans.
AB  == a major function of the salivary pellicle on oral surfaces is to promote colonization of the commensal microbiota by providing binding sites for adherence. streptococcus mitis is an early colonizer of the oral cavity whereas streptococcus mutans represents a later colonizer. to survive and grow, oral bacteria produce enzymes, proteases and glycosidases, which allow them to exploit salivary proteins as a nutrient source. in this study, adherence and proteolytic  activity of s. mitis biovar 2 and s. mutans were investigated in a flow-cell model in the presence of different populations of surface-associated salivary proteins. streptococcus mitis biovar 2 adhered well to surfaces coated with both  a muc5b-enriched fraction and a pool of low-density proteins containing muc7, amylase, cystatin, gp340, immunoglobulin a, lactoferrin, lysozyme and statherin,  whereas adherence of s. mutans to these proteins was poor. in environments of muc5b or the low-density proteins, both s. mitis biovar 2 and s. mutans showed high levels of proteolytic activity. for s. mitis in the muc5b environment, most  of this activity may be attributable to contact with the molecules in the fluid phase although activity was also enhanced by adherence to surface-associated muc5b. these data suggest that although they differ in their capacity to adhere to surface-associated salivary proteins, in the natural environment exploitation  of saliva as a nutrient source can contribute to survival and colonization of the oral cavity by both s. mitis biovar 2 and s. mutans.

TI  == uv-c-irradiation sublethal stress does not alter antibiotic susceptibility of the viridans group streptococci to beta-lactam, macrolide, and fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents.
AB  == aim: previous work has indicated that environmental stresses on bacteria might lead to an upregulation of stress response. led curing lights (315-400 nm) and other uv lights used in tooth whitening cosmetic procedures might act as stresses. we examined the effect of uv-c light, as a high-energy surrogate to the lower-energy uv-a light used in such instruments, to examine its effect on the antibiotic susceptibility of viridans group streptococci. methods: twelve species of viridans group streptococci were examined in this study: streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus australis, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis. these organisms were exposed to varying degrees of sublethal uv-c radiation, and their minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility was determined by broth dilution assay against three classes of commonly-used antibiotics: beta-lactams (penicillin), macrolides (erythromycin), and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin). results: there was no significant difference between antibiotic susceptibility before uv-c exposure and following maximum sublethal stress, prior to cell death due to fatal uv-c exposure. conclusions: exposure to uv-c light will not result in altered antibiotic susceptibility patterns on viridans group streptococci. given that uv-c is more toxic and mutagenic than uv-a light, it is unlikely than uv-a light  would yield any difference in response to such exposure.

AB  == streptococcus mutans has been considered the principal etiological agent of dental caries in humans. s. mutans can secrete three kinds of glucosyltransferases (gtfs). one of these, gtf-b, which synthesizes water-insoluble glucans from sucrose, has been considered to be one of the most important factors of cariogenic dental plaque formation. therefore, determination of whether gtf-b is present in plaque and saliva samples may contribute to the evaluation of individual virulence potential (caries risk). the aim of this study was to develop a feasible enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) for the routine quantification of gtf-b in plaque-derived cultures and clinical samples,  and to apply this assay to an epidemiological study. to determine the presence of gtf-b in plaque samples, a sandwich-elisa was devised, consisting of mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against gtf-b and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. the developed elisa allowed for quantification of the amounts of purified gtf-b with satisfactory sensitivity and specificity; this method was not affected by other components such as plaque and  saliva. plaque samples from healthy volunteers were examined using this elisa method and microbial analysis to apply the assay to an epidemiological study. a correlation was observed between the amount of extracted gtf-b and s. mutans levels as determined by elisa and cultivated with mitis salivarius bacitracin agar plates derived from plaque samples, although there were some exceptions. in  this regard, this elisa system has the advantage of estimating both the individual numbers of s. mutans and the productivity of gtf-b, namely, the cariogenic potential of s. mutans simultaneously. these results indicate that this elisa method is a useful tool for the diagnosis of caries risk.

TI  == influence of orthodontic treatment on oral streptococci.
AB  == objective of this study is to evaluate the changes of the oral microbial flora, concentrating on the oral streptococci, after the first 3 and 6 months of orthodontic treatment. materials and methods: 40 patients, aged 7-17, that presented for orthodontic treatment between april and september 2010 in the department of orthodontics and dento-facial orthopedics of "carol davila" university of medicine and pharmacy, bucharest have been selected. according to the protocol, coronary and subgingival plaque was collected from the dental surface before starting any orthodontic treatment (t0), 3 months after wearing orthodontic appliances (t1) and 6 months after wearing orthodontic appliances (t2). the samples were studied in cantacuzino national institute of research-development for microbiology and immunology [isolation on columbia agar  with 5% sheep blood, identification on morphotinctorial, growth and biochemical characteristics using api 20 strep (biomerieux)]. bacterial concentration (colony-forming units/sample = cfu/sample) for the aerobic and anaerobic flora was calculated by the serial dilution method of counting bacteria. results: 106 strains of oral streptococci were isolated from dental plaque, belonging to 6 species (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus acidominimus),  37 strains of oral streptococci in patients from group i (t0), 40 strains from group ii (t1) and 29 strains of oral streptococci from group iii (t2). after 3 months (t1) the aerobic bacteria percentage, detected at a concentration between  10(5) and 10(6), increased from 30 to 38.2%. the percentage of patients with a bacterial concentration higher than 10(6) cfu/sample increased from 5% to 8.8%. the samples colected at t2 (patients examined after 6 months of orthodonic treatment) presented a lower bacterial concentration, as compared to group ii (t1). the most common isolated species of streptococci were s. salivarius, s. oralis and s. mutans (37.5%, 22.5% and 10%), whose frequency increased after 3 months of treatment to 41.14%, 32.3% and respectively 14.4%, returning after 6 months of treatment at values similar to those recorded before beginning the orthodontic treatment. conclusions: presence of orthodontic appliances may produce a transitory increase of bacterial concentration (cfu/sample) and isolation rate of oral streptococci, returning to the level prior to the application of these devices after a time interval of several months.

TI  == using high throughput sequencing to explore the biodiversity in oral bacterial communities.
AB  == high throughput sequencing of 16s ribosomal rna gene amplicons is a cost-effective method for characterization of oral bacterial communities. however, before undertaking large-scale studies, it is necessary to understand the technique-associated limitations and intrinsic variability of the oral ecosystem. in this work we evaluated bias in species representation using an in vitro-assembled mock community of oral bacteria. we then characterized the bacterial communities in saliva and buccal mucosa of five healthy subjects to investigate the power of high throughput sequencing in revealing their diversity  and biogeography patterns. mock community analysis showed primer and dna isolation biases and an overestimation of diversity that was reduced after eliminating singleton operational taxonomic units (otus). sequencing of salivary  and mucosal communities found a total of 455 otus (0.3% dissimilarity) with only  78 of these present in all subjects. we demonstrate that this variability was partly the result of incomplete richness coverage even at great sequencing depths, and so comparing communities by their structure was more effective than comparisons based solely on membership. with respect to oral biogeography, we found inter-subject variability in community structure was lower than site differences between salivary and mucosal communities within subjects. these differences were evident at very low sequencing depths and were mostly caused by  the abundance of streptococcus mitis and gemella haemolysans in mucosa. in summary, we present an experimental and data analysis framework that will facilitate design and interpretation of pyrosequencing-based studies. despite challenges associated with this technique, we demonstrate its power for evaluation of oral diversity and biogeography patterns.

TI  == streptococcus troglodytae sp. nov., from the chimpanzee oral cavity.
AB  == six strains, tku 25, tku 28, tku 30, tku 31(t), tku 33 and tku 34, were isolated  from the oral cavity of a chimpanzee (pan troglodytes). colonies of strains grown on mitis-salivarius agar were similar in morphology to that of streptococcus mutans. the novel strains were gram-stain-positive, facultatively anaerobic cocci that lacked catalase activity. analysis of the partial 16s rrna gene sequences of these isolates showed that the most closely related strain was the type strain of s. mutans (96.4 %). the next closely related strains to the isolates were the type strains of streptococcus devriesei (94.5 %) and streptococcus downei (93.9 %). these isolates could be distinguished from s. mutans by inulin fermentation and alkaline phosphatase activity (api zym system). the peptidoglycan type of the novel isolates was glu-lys-ala(3). strains were not susceptible to bacitracin. on the basis of phenotypic characterization, partial 16s rrna gene and two housekeeping gene (groel and soda) sequence data, we propose a novel taxon, streptococcus troglodytae sp. nov.; the type strain is tku 31(t) ( = jcm 18038(t) = dsm 25324(t)).

TI  == comparison of microbial changes in early redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.
AB  == background: surfaces and fluids can affect oral bacterial colonization. the aim of this study is to compare redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.  methods: supragingival plaque samples were taken from 55 dentate individuals and  the denture teeth of 62 edentulous individuals before and after professional cleaning. also, samples from seven "teeth" (samples included dentures) in randomly selected quadrants were collected after 1, 2, 4, and 7 days of no oral hygiene. samples were analyzed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. counts and proportions of 41 bacterial taxa were determined at each time point, and significant differences were determined using the mann-whitney u test. ecological succession was determined using a modified moving window analysis. results: mean  total dna probe counts were similar precleaning but were higher in dentate individuals at all post-cleaning visits (p <0.01). precleaning edentate biofilms  had higher counts and proportions of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus mutans, whereas dentate individuals had higher proportions of tannerella forsythia, selenomonas noxia, and neisseria mucosa. by day 2, mean counts of all taxa were higher in natural teeth, and most remained higher at day  7 (p <0.01). succession was more rapid and complex in dentate individuals. both groups demonstrated increased proportions of s. mitis and s. oralis by day 1. n.  mucosa, veillonella parvula, and eikenella corrodens increased in both groups, but later in samples from edentate individuals. conclusions: "mature" natural and denture teeth biofilms have similar total numbers of bacteria but different species proportions. post-cleaning biofilm redevelopment is more rapid and more complex on natural teeth than on denture teeth.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis supports horizontal gene transfer of l-amino acid oxidase gene in streptococcus oligofermentans.
AB  == phylogenetic analysis of 10 amino acid sequences from 19 streptococcus species showed that s. oligofermentans clustered within the mitis group. however, the l-amino acid oxidase (laao) of s. oligofermentans showed a different clustering pattern from the other proteins analyzed implicating horizontal gene transfer (hgt) in the origin of the s. oligofermentans laao gene. laao of s. oligofermentans is known to confer ability to compete with other oral cavity bacteria, most notably s. mutans; therefore, the hgt event may have been important in extending the ecological niche occupied by this species, consistent  with those of other studies suggesting that hgt can play a key role in enabling bacterial species to occupy new ecological niches.

TI  == the cariogenic characters of xylitol-resistant and xylitol-sensitive streptococcus mutans in biofilm formation with salivary bacteria.
AB  == streptococcus mutans metabolize carbohydrates, such as glucose and sucrose, to produce acid and enhance biofilm formation with the early colonizing bacteria to  induce dental caries. xylitol has been used as a reliable substitute for carbohydrate to inhibit the acid production of s. mutans. however, long-term xylitol consumption leads to the emergence of xylitol-resistance in s. mutans. the aim of this study was to investigate the cariogenic trait of xylitol-resistant (x(r)) s. mutans using biofilm formation and coaggregation of xylitol-sensitive (x(s)) and x(r) s. mutans with salivary bacteria and their glucosyltransferases expression. when x(s) or x(r) s. mutans were incubated in brain heart infusion broth with bacteria from human saliva, x(r)s. mutans exhibited reduction in biofilm formation in comparison to x(s) s. mutans. the coaggregation between x(r) s. mutans and s, gordonii, s. mitis, s. oralis or s. sanguinis was less pronounced than that of x(s) s. mutans in the presence of sucrose. however, there was no difference in the coaggregation between x(r) and x(s) s. mutans in the sucrose-free condition. the level of gtfb and gtfc mrna expression of x(r) s. mutans was lower than that of x(s) s. mutans, whilst the level of gtfd mrna expression did not differ between the two strains. the reduction of biofilm formation in x(s) s. mutans due to decrease in glucosyltransferases expression suggests that x(r) s. mutans may be less cariogenic than x(s) s. mutans.

TI  == a five-species transcriptome array for oral mixed-biofilm studies.
AB  == background: oral polymicrobial interactions and biofilm formation are associated  with initiation and progression of caries, gingivitis, and periodontitis. transcriptome studies of such interactions, allowing a first mechanistic insight, are hampered by current single-species array designs. methodology/principal findings: in this study we used 385 k nimblegene technology for design and evaluation of an array covering the full genomes of 5 important physiological-, cariogenic-, and periodontitis-associated microorganisms (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and porphyromonas gingivalis). array hybridization was done with cdna from cultures grown for 24 h anaerobically. single species experiments identified cross-species hybridizing array probes. these probes could be neglected in a mixed-species experimental setting without the need to exclude  the whole genes from the analysis. between 69% and almost 99% of the genomes were actively transcribed under the mono-species planktonic, monolayer, and biofilm conditions. the influence of streptococcus mitis (not represented on the array) on s. mutans gene transcription was determined as a test for a dual-species mixed biofilm setup. phenotypically, under the influence of s. mitis an increase in s.  mutans biofilm mass and a decrease in media ph-value were noticed, thereby confirming previously published data. employing a stringent cut-off (2-fold, p<0.05), 19 s. mutans transcripts were identified with increased abundance, and 11 with decreased abundance compared to a s. mutans mono-species biofilm. several of these genes have previously been found differentially regulated under general  and acid stress, thereby confirming the value of this array. conclusions/significance: this new array allows transcriptome studies on multi-species oral biofilm interactions. it may become an important asset in future oral biofilm and inhibitor/therapy studies.

TI  == salivary iga antibody responses to streptococcus mitis and streptococcus mutans in preterm and fullterm newborn children.
AB  == objectives: the intensities and specificities of salivary iga antibody responses  to antigens of streptococcus mutans, the main pathogen of dental caries, may influence colonization by these organisms during the first 1.5 year of life. thus, the ontogeny of salivary iga responses to oral colonizers continues to warrant investigation, especially with regard to the influence of birth conditions, e.g. prematurity, on the ability of children to efficiently respond to oral microorganisms. in this study, we characterised the salivary antibody responses to two bacterial species which are prototypes of pioneer and pathogenic microorganisms of the oral cavity (streptococcus mitis and streptococcus mutans,  respectively) in fullterm (ft) and preterm (pt) newborn children. methods: salivas from 123 infants (70 ft and 53 pt) were collected during the first 10h after birth and levels of iga and igm antibodies and the presence of s. mutans and s. mitis were analysed respectively by elisa and by chequerboard dna-dna hybridization. two subgroups of 24 ft and 24 pt children were compared with respect to patterns of antibody specificities against s. mutans and s. mitis antigens, using western blot assays. cross-adsorption of 10 infant's saliva was tested to s. mitis, s. mutans and enterococcus faecalis antigens. results: salivary levels of iga at birth were 2.5-fold higher in ft than in pt children (mann-whitney; p<0.05). salivary iga antibodies reactive with several antigens of s. mitis and s. mutans were detected at birth in children with undetectable levels of those bacteria. adsorption of infant saliva with cells of s. mutans produced a reduction of antibodies recognizing s. mitis antigens in half of the neonates. the diversity and intensity of iga responses were lower in pt compared  to ft children, although those differences were not significant. conclusion: these data provide evidence that children have salivary iga antibodies shortly after birth, which might influence the establishment of the oral microbiota, and  that the levels of salivary antibody might be related to prematurity.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of silver diamine fluoride in different concentrations.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of silver diamine fluoride - sdf -(cariestop), at commercial concentrations of 12% and 30%, was evaluated against clinical and pattern strains (atcc 25175) of s. mutans. clinical isolates were obtained from the saliva of six children attending the pediatric dentistry clinic ufpb, being grouped as follows: gi- low risk and caries activity, gii- high risk and caries activity. once sown, the strains were isolated from mitis-salivarius agar and divided into seven groups - m1 (pattern strain) to m7. the antibacterial activity was determined by maximum inhibitory dilution (mid) by the agar diffusion method, using serial dilutions (1:1 to 1:32) and the pure formulations of sdf and chlorhexidine 0.12% (positive control). after incubation, the inhibition zones were measured. the bactericidal and bacteriostatic actions of pure substances and in their respective mids were evaluated by test of germicidal power using glass specimens, after inoculation by the strains and incubation for 24 hours in bhi broth. each specimen was exposed to chlorhexidine and to sdf for 30s, 3min, 30min and 1h, then incubated for 24 h in bhi broth. the samples were subcultured in mitis-salivarius agar to evaluate the bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity of  the substances. the data were analyzed in a comparative-descriptive method. the cariestop 30% was effective until the last dilution (1:32) on all strains. for cariestop 12%, the mids corresponded to last dilution (1:32) in almost all samples, except for m3 (1:8). chlorhexidine showed dim in the last concentrations (1:32) on five samples, and in the concentration 1:8 for m3 and m7. as evidence of the germicidal power the substances had bactericidal activity at all times analyzed. it was concluded that the cariostatic showed antibacterial activity when compared to chlorhexidine and these two substances presented bactericidal action against the strains at all contact times.

TI  == effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation between oral streptococci and actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == background: the co-aggregation of oral bacteria leads to their clearance from the oral cavity. poor oral hygiene and high saliva viscosity are common amongst the elderly; thus, they frequently suffer from pneumonia caused by the aspiration of  oral microorganisms. objectives: to examine the direct effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces. materials and methods: fifteen oral streptococcal and a single actinomyces strain were used. co-aggregation was assessed by a visual assay in phosphate buffer and a spectrophotometric assay in the same buffer containing 0-60% glycerol or whole saliva. results: nine oral streptococci co-aggregated with actinomyces naeslundii atcc12104 in the visual assay and were subsequently used for the spectrophotometric analysis. all tested strains displayed a decrease in co-aggregation with increasing amounts of glycerol in the buffer. the co-aggregation of streptococcus oralis with a. naeslundii recovered to baseline level following the removal of glycerol. the per cent co-aggregation of s. oralis with a. naeslundii was significantly correlated with the viscosity in unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva samples (correlation coefficients: -0.52 and -0.48, respectively). conclusion: this study suggests that saliva viscosity affects the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces and that bacterial co-aggregation decreases with increasing saliva viscosity.

AB  == objective: to investigate three tropical plant materials - clove seeds [syzygium  aromaticum (s. aromaticum)], bitter kola fruits [garcinia kola (g. kola)] and tobacco leaves (nicotiana species) as potential targeted killers of streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), a cavity-causing bacterium (gram-positive, facultative anaerobe) that resides in a multispecies microbial community (dental plaque) for  the treatment of dental caries (tooth decay). methods: thirty one (31) teeth samples were collected from patients with obvious signs of tooth decay (swollen gum, weak or fallen tooth, etc.) using sterile swab sticks. these samples were collected from two major dental clinics in nsukka, enugu state, nigeria and investigated by spread inoculation onto sterile blood agar and mueller hinton agar (mha) respectively and incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. the discrete colonies obtained were further re-inoculated onto sterile mitis salivarius agar (msa) plates and incubated as above. the isolates were characterized by gram staining and catalase test. tobacco leaves, clove seeds and bitter kola fruits were ground into powder, extracted with three different solvents (n-hexane, hot water and ethanol), filtered, dried and stored in clean containers, corked and kept until used. the plant extracts were investigated for phytochemistry, minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), minimum cidal concentration (mcc) and compared with some conventional antibiotics commonly used against tooth decay. antibiotic  sensitivity test was also carried out. the results were statistically analyzed. results: the extracts showed varied phytochemical composition but most abundantly the flavonoids. our result also shows that females (16) have more tooth decay than males (15) and that 16 samples were very bloody while 15 were slightly bloody. the microbial characterization showed that 18 samples were catalase-positive indicating the presence of s. mutans while 13 were catalase-negative suspected to be staphylococcus spp. the gram reaction confirmed 13 gram-negative and 18 gram-positive organisms. the n-hexane extract had the best antimicrobial activity followed by the ethanol and lastly hot water. mic showed that n-hexane clove extract had the largest inhibition zone diameter, followed by bitter kola extract and lastly tobacco extract. the antibiotic sensitivity test credited ciprofloxacin the best because it exhibited broad spectrum of action. conclusions: since the n-hexane extract of clove seeds demonstrated preferential growth-inhibitory activity against the causal cariogenic pathogens (s. mutans) in dental caries, we therefore, report here that clove extract be henceforth considered as a potential ingredient in toothpaste preparation.

TI  == establishment of streptococcus mutans in infants induces decrease in the proportion of salivary alpha-haemolytic bacteria.
AB  == objective: for paediatric dentists, an indicator to assess caries risk of infants is very important. conventionally, the number and/or proportions of streptococcus mutans have been employed as risk indicator; however, because such figures reflect the existing situation, they are not suitable for assessing caries risk of infants that have not yet been infected with s. mutans. thus, we searched for  an indicator for the establishment of s. mutans. methods: to evaluate the changes caused by the establishment of s. mutans in the microbiota of the infant oral cavity, we monitored changes in the oral microbiota of two pre-dentate infants over a 3-year period and in a cross-sectional study of 40 nursery school-aged children by cultivation of saliva on nonselective blood agar, mitis-salivarius agar, and mitis-salivarius agar supplemented with bacitracin combined with identification of selected isolates. results: two longitudinal observations suggested that the establishment of s. mutans would induce a decrease in alpha-haemolytic bacteria in the microbial population of the oral cavity. this suggestion was compensated with the results of cross-sectional study, and it was  revealed that the establishment of 10(3) cfu/ml of mutans streptococci in saliva  might be predicted by a microbiota comprising less than approximately 55% of alpha-haemolytic. conclusion: decrease in the proportion of alpha-haemolytic bacteria in saliva of infant was found to be applicable as an indicator to predict the establishment of s. mutans and to assess dental caries risk as a background for planning of dental care and treatment in the infants before infection with s. mutans.

TI  == exploring internal features of 16s rrna gene for identification of clinically relevant species of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == background: streptococcus is an economically important genus as a number of species belonging to this genus are human and animal pathogens. the genus has been divided into different groups based on 16s rrna gene sequence similarity. the variability observed among the members of these groups is low and it is difficult to distinguish them. the present study was taken up to explore 16s rrna gene sequence to develop methods that can be used for preliminary identification  and can supplement the existing methods for identification of clinically-relevant isolates of the genus streptococcus. methods: 16s rrna gene sequences belonging to the isolates of s. dysgalactiae, s. equi, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, s. gallolyticus, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. pneumoniae, s. thermophilus and s. anginosus were analyzed with the purpose to define genetic variability within each species to generate a phylogenetic framework, to identify species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. results: the framework based analysis was used to segregate streptococcus spp. previously  identified upto genus level. this segregation was validated using species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. 43 uncharacterized streptococcus spp. could be identified using this approach. conclusions: the markers generated exploring 16s rrna gene sequences provided useful tool that can be further used for identification of different species of the genus streptococcus.

TI  == differential response of streptococcus mutans towards friend and foe in mixed-species cultures.
AB  == in the oral biofilm, the 'mitis' streptococci are among the first group of organisms to colonize the tooth surface. their proliferation is thought to be an  important factor required for antagonizing the growth of cariogenic species such  as streptococcus mutans. in this study, we used a three-species mixed culture to  demonstrate that another ubiquitous early colonizing species, veillonella parvula, can greatly affect the outcome of the competition between a pair of antagonists such as s. mutans and streptococcus gordonii. transcriptome analysis  further revealed that s. mutans responds differentially to its friend (v. parvula) and foe (s. gordonii). in the mixed culture with s. gordonii, all but one of the s. mutans sugar uptake and metabolic genes were downregulated, while genes for alternative energy source utilization and h(2)o(2) tolerance were upregulated, resulting in a slower but persistent growth. in contrast, when cultured with v. parvula, s. mutans grew equally well or better than in monoculture and exhibited relatively few changes within its transcriptome. when v. parvula was introduced into the mixed culture of s. mutans and s. gordonii, it rescued the growth inhibition of s. mutans. in this three-species environment, s. mutans increased the expression of genes required for the uptake and metabolism of minor sugars, while genes required for oxidative stress tolerance were downregulated. we conclude that the major factors that affect the competition between s. mutans and s. gordonii are carbohydrate utilization and h(2)o(2) resistance. the presence of v. parvula in the tri-species culture mitigates these two major factors and allows s. mutans to proliferate, despite the presence of s. gordonii.

TI  == dental caries experience in relation to salivary findings and molecular identification of s. mutans and s. sobrinus in subjects with down syndrome.
AB  == this study investigated the association between clinical and salivary or molecular parameters in down syndrome subjects. sixty individuals (1- to 48-year  old) were clinically examined using dmft/dmfs. stimulated saliva was collected; salivary flow was calculated (ml/min), buffering capacity was measured using a standard ph tape. in addition, 25 mul of saliva was diluted using 10-fold-dilution method and then placed on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar to count colony forming units (cfu/ml) of mutans streptococci. polymerase chain reaction analysis identified species. caries indexes were 0.65-13.5 (dmft) and 0.65-26.0 (dmfs) according to groups. ninety-four percent of subjects had low flow rate (0.7-1.0 ml/min) and 44% had low buffering capacity (ph < 4). besides,  60% had more than 1 x 10(6) cfu/ml, 60% had s. mutans, and 41.4% had s. sobrinus. caries indexes did not significantly correlate with flow rate, buffering capacity, cfu/ml by pearson's correlation (p > 0.05), and showed no significant association with prevalence of species by chi-square (p > 0.05). there is no association between clinical picture and salivary or molecular parameters in down syndrome subjects.

TI  == mechanism of oil-pulling therapy - in vitro study.
AB  == background: oil pulling has been used extensively as a traditional indian folk remedy without scientific proof for many years for strengthening teeth, gums and  jaws and to prevent decay, oral malodor, bleeding gums and dryness of throat and  cracked lips. aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of sesame oil and lignans isolated from sesame oil on oral microorganisms and to check whether saponification or emulsification occurs during oil-pulling therapy. materials and methods: the in vitro study was carried out in three different phases: (1) antibacterial activity of the lignans and sesame oil were tested by minimum inhibitory concentration assay by agar dilution method and agar well diffusion method, respectively. (2) increase in free fatty acid level of oil and the quantity of sodium hydroxide (naoh) used up in the titration are good indicators of saponification process. this was assessed using  analytical tests for vegetable oils. (3) swished oil was observed under light microscope to assess the status of the oil, presence of microorganisms, oral debris and foreign bodies. results: sesamin and sesamolin isolated from sesame oil did not have any antibacterial effect against oral microorganisms like streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus viridans. emulsification of sesame oil occurs during oil-pulling therapy. increased consumption of naoh in titration is a definite indication of a possible saponification process. conclusion: the myth that the effect of oil-pulling therapy on oral health was just a placebo effect has been broken and there are clear indications of possible saponification and emulsification process, which enhances its mechanical cleaning action.

TI  == streptococcus
AB  == the genus streptococcus , a heterogeneous group of gram-positive bacteria, has broad significance in medicine and industry. various streptococci are important ecologically as part of the normal microbial flora of animals and humans; some can also cause diseases that range from subacute to acute or even chronic. among  the significant human diseases attributable to streptococci are scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, glomerulonephritis, and pneumococcal pneumonia. streptococci are essential in industrial and dairy processes and as indicators of pollution. the nomenclature for streptococci, especially the nomenclature in medical use, has been based largely on serogroup identification of cell wall components rather than on species names. for several decades, interest has focused on two major species that cause severe infections: s pyogenes (group a streptococci) and s pneumoniae (pneumococci). in 1984, two members were assigned  a new genus - the group d enterococcal species (which account for 98% of human enterococcal infections) became enterococcus faecalis (the majority of human clinical isolates) and e faecium (associated with a remarkable capacity for antibiotic resistance). in recent years, increasing attention has been given to other streptococcal species, partly because innovations in serogrouping methods have led to advances in understanding the pathogenetic and epidemiologic significance of these species. a variety of cell-associated and extracellular products are produced by streptococci, but their cause-effect relationship with pathogenesis has not been defined. some of the other medically important streptococci are s agalactiae (group b), an etiologic agent of neonatal disease;  e faecalis (group d), a major cause of endocarditis, and the viridans streptococci. particularly for the viridans streptococci, taxonomy and nomenclature are not yet fully reliable or consistent. important members of the viridans streptococci, normal commensals, include s mutans and s sanguis (involved in dental caries), s mitis (associated with bacteremia, meningitis, periodontal disease and pneumonia), and "s milleri" (associated with suppurative  infections in children and adults). there remains persistent taxonomic confusion  regarding "s milleri." these and other streptococci of medical importance are listed intable 13-1by serogroup designation, normal ecologic niche, and associated disease.

TI  == influence of salvadora persica (miswak) extract on physical and antimicrobial properties of glass ionomer cement.
AB  == aim: to investigate physical and antimicrobial properties of glass ionomer cement (gic) combined with salvadora persica extract (spe). methods: spe was added to gic (fuji ix) in concentrations of 1%, 2% and 4% w/w. the compressive strength and diametral tensile strength were measured at 1 h, 24 h and 7 days. the antimicrobial effect was tested in agar dilution assay in blood agar plates with  candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius and actinomyces naeslundii as test organisms. gic containing 5% chlorhexidine served as positive control. results: significant differences were found for the compressive strength and diametral tensile strength as a result of adding spe to gic (p<0.05). gic with 2 or 4 % spe was significantly weaker than the gic control, while gic with 1% spe was not different from the control. the mean values for the 4% spe-containing specimens and the gic control group ranged from 108.7mpa to 141.1mpa for cs and from 8.2mpa to 12.5mpa for dts. the 1% spe-containing specimens were not different in physical properties compared to the control gic specimens; the 2% spe-containing  specimens were statistically slightly less strong (p<0.05), but within an acceptable range. as compared with pure gic the antimicrobial properties of the spe-containing specimens were increased significantly (p<0.01). it has been found up to a 2-fold increased inhibition compared to the gic with increasing concentrations of spe. for most microorganisms tested the spe group inhibited less than chlorhexidine, but significantly better than pure gic (p<0.01). conclusion: spe could be a promising natural material as an additive to gics. further studies should include in vivo tests and other antimicrobial and physical properties of this combination.

TI  == phylogenetic group- and species-specific oligonucleotide probes for single-cell detection of lactic acid bacteria in oral biofilms.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to design and evaluate fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) probes for the single-cell detection and enumeration of lactic acid bacteria, in particular organisms belonging to the major phylogenetic groups and species of oral lactobacilli and to abiotrophia/granulicatella. results: as lactobacilli are known for notorious resistance to probe penetration, probe-specific assay protocols were experimentally developed to provide maximum cell wall permeability, probe accessibility, hybridization stringency, and fluorescence intensity. the new assays were then applied in a pilot study to three biofilm samples harvested from variably demineralized bovine enamel discs that had been carried in situ for 10 days by different volunteers. best probe penetration and fluorescent labeling of reference strains were obtained after combined lysozyme and achromopeptidase treatment followed by exposure to lipase.  hybridization stringency had to be established strictly for each probe. thereafter all probes showed the expected specificity with reference strains and  labeled the anticipated morphotypes in dental plaques. applied to in situ grown biofilms the set of probes detected only lactobacillus fermentum and bacteria of  the lactobacillus casei group. the most cariogenic biofilm contained two orders of magnitude higher l. fermentum cell numbers than the other biofilms. abiotrophia/granulicatella and streptococci from the mitis group were found in all samples at high levels, whereas streptococcus mutans was detected in only one sample in very low numbers. conclusions: application of these new group- and species-specific fish probes to oral biofilm-forming lactic acid bacteria will allow a clearer understanding of the supragingival biome, its spatial architecture and of structure-function relationships implicated during plaque homeostasis and caries development. the probes should prove of value far beyond the field of oral microbiology, as many of them detect non-oral species and phylogenetic groups of importance in a variety of medical conditions and the food industry.

TI  == effect of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate on streptococcus spp. biofilms.
AB  == aims: the effect of different concentrations of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (hema) was evaluated on biofilm formation and preformed biofilm of streptococcus  mitis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus oralis, alone or combined to each other. methods and results: twofold serial dilution of hema ranged from 12 to 0.75 mmol l(-1) was added to streptococcal broth cultures and mature biofilms in  96-well-microtitre plates to evaluate bacterial biomass and cell viability. hema  affected the streptococcal population in a strain-specific way producing few significant effects. a reduction on biofilm formation and a detachment of preformed biofilm was recorded in strep. mitis atcc 6249, whereas in mixed cultures, the monomer expressed a general aggregative effect on mature biofilms.  a reduction in cell viability was also recorded in an hema-concentration-dependent way in each experimental condition studied. conclusions: these results suggest that the hema prevalent effects are both the reduction of bacterial adhesion to a polystyrene surface and the increase in dead cells also characterized by an aggregative status. significance and impact of the study: understanding the potential effect of hema, released from resin-based materials, on oral bacteria may furnish information for surveillance of the risk  reduction in secondary caries via hindering biofilm generation.

TI  == invasion of human aortic endothelial cells by oral viridans group streptococci and induction of inflammatory cytokine production.
AB  == oral viridans group streptococci are the major commensal bacteria of the supragingival oral biofilm and have been detected in human atheromatous plaque. atherosclerosis involves an ongoing inflammatory response, reportedly involving chronic infection caused by multiple pathogens. the aim of this study was to examine the invasion of human aortic endothelial cells (haecs) by oral viridans group streptococci and the subsequent cytokine production by viable invaded haecs. the invasion of haecs by bacteria was examined using antibiotic protection assays and was visualized by confocal scanning laser microscopy. the inhibitory effects of catalase and cytochalasin d on the invasion of haecs were also examined. the production of cytokines by invaded or infected haecs was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and a real-time polymerase chain reaction method was used to evaluate the expression of cytokine messenger rna. the oral streptococci tested were capable of invading haecs. the number of invasive bacteria increased with the length of the co-culture period. after a certain co-culture period, some organisms were cytotoxic to the haecs. catalase and cytochalasin d inhibited the invasion of haecs by the organism. haecs invaded by streptococcus mutans xc, streptococcus gordonii dl1 (challis), streptococcus gordonii atcc 10558 and streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419 produced more cytokine(s) (interleukin-6, interleukin-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) than non-invaded haecs. the haecs invaded by s. mutans xc produced the largest amounts of cytokines, and the messenger rna expression of cytokines by invaded haecs increased markedly compared with that by non-invaded haecs. these results suggest that oral streptococci may participate in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.

TI  == molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) of gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci in  viridans group streptococci isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == objectives: ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. however, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (cf) airways has not yet been examined. the aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (vgs), in terms of mics and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs). methods: the mics of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the qrdrs for 190 isolates of vgs, originating from the sputa of adult cf patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. vgs organisms included streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus australis and streptococcus mutans. ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and qrdrs within the gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. results: twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (mics >/=8 mg/l) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (mics 4 mg/l). as a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive vgs organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-cf patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. five novel qrdr pcr assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the cf vgs population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential qrdr resistance mutations. double mutations  in gyra and parc/pare led to mics of 16 to >64 mg/l, while single mutations in parc or pare resulted in mics of 8-32 mg/l and 8 mg/l, respectively. the mean homologies of each species to streptococcus pneumoniae r6 were: gyra, 70.3%-95%;  gyrb, 69.6%-96.2%; parc, 76.1%-94.8%; and pare, 70.7%-94.7%. the close relatives  of s. pneumoniae, s. mitis and s. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). conclusions: treatment of p. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with cf may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal vgs flora, where these organisms may potentially  act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the streptococcus milleri group.

TI  == microbiological profiles in saliva and supragingival plaque from caries-active adolescents before and after a short-term daily intake of milk supplemented with  probiotic bacteria - a pilot study.
AB  == purpose: the aim of the present pilot study was to investigate the microbial profile in saliva and supragingival plaque samples collected from caries-active adolescents before and after a daily short-term intake of milk supplemented with  the probiotic bacteria. materials and methods: the present study group consisted  of 18 caries-active adolescents of both sexes who volunteered for participation giving an informed consent. the study has a randomised placebo-controlled double-blind pilot design with two parallel arms. after a 2-week run-in period, the subjects were instructed to drink 2.5 dl of milk supplemented with lactobacillus rhamnosus lb21 (107 cfu/ml) (test) or standard control milk (placebo) once daily for a period of 2 weeks (intervention period). samples of stimulated whole saliva and supragingival plaque were collected at baseline (after run-in) and immediately after the end of the intervention period (follow-up). the salivary levels of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were estimated by conventional culturing on selective agar plates. the presence and level of 19 oral species associated with the caries process were determined using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridisation technique. differences between the groups  were assessed using the non-parametric wilcoxon-mann-whitney and chi-square tests. results: the mean caries experience was high with an average of 7.0 +/- 3.8 proximal enamel lesions. the most prevalent dominating species in the plaque  samples were streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula and streptococcus gordonii. the saliva samples displayed a more mixed profile, with streptococcus mitis, rothia dentocariosa, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus curvata being frequently identified species. all of the subjects harboured mutans streptococci  in their saliva, with 61% of them colonised with salivary lactobacilli. no statistically significant differences in the microbial profiles or the estimated  counts between the baseline and follow-up samples, or between the two study groups, were observed. conclusions: the present study showed that a short-term daily intake of milk supplemented with the probiotic bacterium l. rhamnosus lb21  did not significantly affect the microbial profiles or the levels of caries-associated bacteria in saliva and supragingival plaque samples collected from caries-active adolescents.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the essential oil from rosmarinus officinalis and its major components against oral pathogens.
AB  == the essential oil of rosmarinus officinalis l. (rosemary) was obtained by hydro-distillation and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. sixty-two constituents were identified, representing 98.06% of the total oil content. oxygenated monoterpenes were the predominant components. the rosemary oil was characterized as having prominent (> 5%) contents of camphor (18.9%), verbenone (11.3%), a-pinene (9.6%), beta-myrcene (8.6%), 1,8-cineole (8.0%), and  beta-caryophyllene (5.1%). the antimicrobial activity of the oil as well as of its major constituents was tested against the following microorganisms: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, and enterococcus faecalis, which are potentially responsible for the formation of dental caries in humans. the microdilution method was used for determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) during evaluation of the antibacterial activity. the essential oil displayed low activity against the selected microorganisms. in the  present study, the pure major compounds were more active than the essential oil.  among all the microorganisms tested, the pathogen s. mitis was the most susceptible and e. faecalis was the most resistant to the evaluated samples. this is the first report on antimicrobial activity of the major components of rosemary oil against oral pathogens.

AB  == in the present work, the anticariogenic activities of three pimarane-type diterpenes obtained by fungal biotransformation were investigated. among these metabolites, ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol was the most active compound, displaying very promising mic values (ranging from 1.5 to 4.0 mug ml(-1)) against the main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: streptococcus salivarius,  s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, and lactobacillus casei. time kill assays performed with ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol against the primary causative agent s. mutans revealed that this compound only avoids growth of the inoculum in the first 12 h (bacteriostatic effect). however, its bactericidal effect is clearly noted thereafter (between 12 and 24 h). the curve profile obtained by combining ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol and chlorhexidine revealed a  significant reduction in the time necessary for killing s. mutans compared with each of these two chemicals alone. however, no synergistic effect was observed using the same combination in the checkerboard assays against this microorganism. in conclusion, our results point out that ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol is an important metabolite in the search for new effective anticariogenic agents.

TI  == proteases of an early colonizer can hinder streptococcus mutans colonization in vitro.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is the primary cariogen that produces several virulence factors that are modulated by a competence-stimulating peptide (csp) signaling system. in this study, we sought to determine if proteases produced by early dental plaque colonizers such as streptococcus gordonii interfere with the subsequent colonization of s. mutans bm71 on the existing streptococcal biofilms. we demonstrated that s. mutans bm71 colonized much less efficiently in vitro on streptococcal biofilms than on actinomyces naeslundii biofilms. several oral streptococci, relative to a. naeslundii, produced proteases that inactivated the  s. mutans csp. we further demonstrated that cell protein extracts from s. gordonii, but not from a. naeslundii, interfered with s. mutans bm71 colonization. in addition, s. mutans bm71 colonized more efficiently on the sgc protease knockout mutant of s. gordonii than on the parent biofilms. in conclusion, proteases of early colonizers can interfere with subsequent colonization by s. mutans in vitro.

TI  == [classical and new approaches in laboratory diagnosis of viridans streptococci].
AB  == viridans group streptococci (vgs) are gram-positive microorganisms that can form  alpha-hemolytic colonies on sheep blood agar. they reside as normal flora in oral cavity, respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital tract and on skin. they can cause bacteremia, endocarditis, meningitis and septicemia following dental procedures. the diagnosis of vgs are difficult since the taxonomic classification and species na-mes may change due in time. viridans group streptococci are classified into 5 groups (sanguinis, mitis, mutans, salivarius, anginosus) according to biochemical reactions and 16s rrna sequencing. since streptococcus pneumoniae is a member of the mitis group, the other important species in this group deserves investigation. genetic exchange between streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis and s.pneumoniae by transformation and lysis mechanisms occur continously as they share the same anatomical region. these mechanisms play role in exchanging capsular and antibiotic resistance genes between these species. the cultivation of vgs usually starts with the inoculation of various patient specimens into sheep blood agar and the detection of alpha-hemolytic colonies. observation of gram-positive cocci microscopically, the detection of optochin-resistant and bile insoluble colonies with few exceptions are the further important steps in laboratory diagnosis. vgs are then identified at species level by using biochemical reactions, automated diagnostic systems and molecular methods. the last step in the laboratory diagnosis of vgs is antibiotic susceptibility testing which is of outmost importance as penicillin and erythromycin resistance are on rise. in this review article, classification of vgs, similarities between s.pneumoniae and mitis group streptococci and the laboratory diagnosis of vgs have been discussed.

TI  == setup of an in vitro test system for basic studies on biofilm behavior of mixed-species cultures with dental and periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: caries and periodontitis are important human diseases associated with formation of multi-species biofilms. the involved bacteria are intensively studied to understand the molecular basis of the interactions in such biofilms. this study established a basic in vitro single and mixed-species culture model for oral bacteria combining three complimentary methods. the setup allows a rapid screening for effects in the mutual species interaction. furthermore, it is easy  to handle, inexpensive, and reproducible. methods: streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, typical inhabitants of the healthy oral cavity, s. mutans as main carriogenic species, and porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, s. intermedius and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as periodontitis-associated bacteria, were investigated for their biofilm forming ability. different liquid growth media were evaluated. safranin-staining allowed monitoring of biofilm formation under the chosen conditions. viable counts and microscopy permitted investigation of biofilm behavior in mixed-species and transwell setups. findings: s. mitis, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and p. micra failed to form biofilm structures. s. mutans, s. sanguinis, s. intermedius and s. salivarius established abundant biofilm masses in cdm/sucrose. a. actinomycetemcomitans formed patchy monolayers. for in depth analysis s. mitis, s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans were chosen, because i) they are representatives of the physiological-, cariogenic and periodontitis-associated bacterial flora, respectively and ii) their difference in their biofilm forming ability. microscopic analysis confirmed the results of safranin staining. investigation of two species combinations of s. mitis with either s. mutans or a. actinomycetemcomitans revealed bacterial interactions influencing biofilm mass, biofilm structure and cell viability. conclusions: this setup shows safranin staining, microscopic analysis and viable counts together are crucial for basic examination and evaluation of biofilms. our experiment generated meaningful results, exemplified by the noted s. mitis influence, and allows a fast decision about the most important bacterial interactions which should be investigated in depth.

TI  == investigation of supragingival plaque microbiota in different caries status of chinese preschool children by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == this study aimed to detect differences in the richness of total supragingival plaque microbiota as well as the species composition of oral streptococci involved in the different stages of dental caries. forty-five plaque samples were collected from caries-moderate (cm, 4 </= dmfs </= 6), caries-susceptible (cs, dmfs >/= 10), and age-matched caries-free children separately. total dna was isolated directly from each sample, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) analyses using universal and primers specific for oral streptococci were carried out. using 16s rdna pcr-dgge, 34 different species of bacteria were identified in a culture-independent manner and classified into 11 genera according to phylogenetic analysis. among them, mitis group streptococci and campylobacter, which were present in health status, no longer appeared in caries-susceptible samples. in addition, capnocytophaga, burkholderia, and prevotella were found significantly less frequently in the cs group samples (p < 0.05), while there were no significant differences among the prevalence of neisseria, leptotrichia, haemophilus, mutans group streptococci, corynebacterium, and actinomyces in the three groups. further dgge analysis of rnpb gene amplicons obtained with oral streptococci species-specific primers showed that a total of 23 species of oral streptococci were identified. streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus oralis showed a significantly higher prevalence in healthy children (p < 0.05), while that of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus did not vary among the three groups. overall, these results suggest that supragingival plaque microbiota as a  whole undergoes a more complicated shift in the caries process.

TI  == amplification of minute amounts of oral bacterial dna for real-time quantitative  pcr analysis.
AB  == background: high-throughput technologies for typing caries or health-associated bacterial populations including pcr, dna microarrays and next-generation sequencing techniques require significant amounts of bacterial dna. in clinical settings, the amount of sampled dna is often limited and amplification is therefore essential. protocols should be able to reproducibly amplify sequences in order to maintain initial sequence ratios and should not bias the representation of particular dna sequence types. methods: a linear amplification  protocol using dna polymerase i was modified to permit the amplification and subsequent analysis of small amounts of bacterial dna. the protocol was tested on human oral bacterial biofilms from different sources, including carious dentine and plaque, and compared to amplification by degenerate pcr of 16s rdna sequences. real-time quantitative pcr of 24 bacterial species was used as a readout system to test amplified dna against unamplified dna. results: the amplification protocol reliably yielded 5-10 mug dna from as little as 12.5 ng of template dna. correlation coefficients between real-time quantitative pcr results from amplified and unamplified dna were between 0.78 and 0.98. conclusion: the optimized protocol consistently produced amplification products from minute amounts of bacterial dna from caries and plaque; the amplification products are suitable for downstream genetic analyses.

TI  == bacterial 16s sequence analysis of severe caries in young permanent teeth.
AB  == previous studies have confirmed the association of the acid producers streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp. with childhood caries, but they also  suggested these microorganisms are not sufficient to explain all cases of caries. in addition, health-associated bacterial community profiles are not well understood, including the importance of base production and acid catabolism in ph homeostasis. the bacterial community composition in health and in severe caries of the young permanent dentition was compared using sanger sequencing of the ribosomal 16s rrna genes. lactobacillus species were dominant in severe caries, and levels rose significantly as caries progressed from initial to deep lesions.  s. mutans was often observed at high levels in the early stages of caries but also in some healthy subjects and was not statistically significantly associated  with caries progression in the overall model. lactobacillus or s. mutans was found either at low levels or not present in several samples. other potential acid producers observed at high levels in these subjects included strains of selenomonas, neisseria, and streptococcus mitis. propionibacterium fma5 was significantly associated with caries progression but was not found at high levels. an overall loss of community diversity occurred as caries progressed, and species that significantly decreased included the streptococcus mitis-s. pneumoniae-s. infantis group, corynebacterium matruchotii, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, capnocytophaga gingivalis, eubacterium ir009,  campylobacter rectus, and lachnospiraceae sp. c1. the relationship of acid-base metabolism to 16s rrna gene-based species assignments appears to be complex, and  metagenomic approaches that would allow functional profiling of entire genomes will be helpful in elucidating the microbial pathogenesis of caries.

TI  == natural transformation of oral streptococci.
AB  == natural transformation is found in most groups of oral streptococci, including the mitis, the anginosus, and the mutans groups. this ability has been applied as a powerful tool to explore streptococcal gene functions and regulatory pathways,  particularly in streptococcus mutans and streptococcus gordonii. the range of strains and species amenable to transformation has expanded in recent years with  the identification of several competence-stimulating peptide signals (csps). in this chapter we present protocols for natural transformation in strains found in  the three groups of transformable oral streptococci, with focus on methods using  synthetic csps. we also include suggestions on how to optimize competence conditions for individual species or strains.

TI  == in vitro oral biofilm formation on triclosan-coated sutures in the absence and presence of additional antiplaque treatment.
AB  == purpose: this study evaluated the in vitro plaque inhibitory effect of triclosan-coated polyglactin 910 sutures in the absence and presence of an additional antiplaque agent commonly used after oral surgery. materials and methods: triclosan-coated sutures were incubated for 4 hours in freshly collected human saliva and, when appropriate, subsequently treated with an antiplaque rinse containing chlorhexidine-cetyl pyridinium as active components. sutures without a triclosan-coating served as a control. results: triclosan-coated sutures harbored similar amounts of plaque as did uncoated sutures. exposure to the antiplaque rinse caused significant decreases in viable organisms for uncoated and triclosan-coated sutures. however, after application of the antiplaque rinse, more micro-organisms were found on triclosan-coated than on uncoated sutures. conclusion: sutures coated with triclosan do not provide a sufficient antimicrobial effect to prevent in vitro colonization by oral bacteria, whereas use in combination with a chlorhexidine-cetyl pyridinium-containing antiplaque rinse appears to be counterproductive.

TI  == inhibition of streptococcus mutans adherence and biofilm formation using analogues of the sspb peptide.
AB  == objective: streptococcus gordonii is a pioneer colonizer of the enamel salivary pellicle that forms biofilm on the tooth surfaces. recent reports show the surface protein analogue peptide {400 (t) of sspb 390-402 is substituted to k forming sspb (390-t400k-402)} from s. gordonii interacts strongly with salivary receptors to cariogenic bacteria, streptococcus mutans. to characterize the analogue peptide biological activities, we investigated its binding and inhibiting effects, and the role of its amino acid moities. methods: we measured  binding activity of analogue peptides to salivary components using the biacore assay; assayed inhibition activities of peptides for bacterial binding and growth on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads (s-ha); and describe the peptides interfering with biofilm formation of s. mutans on polystyrene surfaces. results: the sspb (390-t400k-402 and -401) peptides significantly bound with salivary components and inhibited the binding of s. mutans and s. gordonii to s-ha without bactericidal activity; but did not inhibit binding of streptococcus mitis, a beneficial commensal. further, the lack of d and e-l at position 390 and 401-402  in the peptide, and substituted peptide sspb (d390h- or d390k-t400k-402) did not  bind to salivary components or inhibit binding of s. mutans. the sspb (390-t400k-402) peptide inhibited biofilm formation on salivary components-coated polystyrene surfaces in absence of conditioned planktonic cells. conclusions: we  found constructing the peptide to include positions 390(d), 400(k) and 401(e), two surface positive and negative connective charges, and at least 12 amino acids are required to bind salivary components and inhibit the binding of s. mutans and s. gordonii.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of rosmarinus officinalis against oral pathogens: relevance of carnosic acid and carnosol.
AB  == the in vitro inhibitory activity of crude etoh/h2o extracts from the leaves and stems of rosmarinus officinalis l. was evaluated against the following microorganisms responsible for initiating dental caries: streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, and enterococcus faecalis. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined with the broth microdilution method. the bioassay-guided fractionation of the leaf extract, which displayed the higher antibacterial activity than the stem extract, led to the identification of carnosic acid (2) and carnosol (3) as the major compounds in the fraction displaying the highest activity, as identified by hplc analysis.  rosmarinic acid (1), detected in another fraction, did not display any activity against the selected microorganisms. hplc analysis revealed the presence of low amounts of ursolic acid (4) and oleanolic acid (5) in the obtained fractions. the results suggest that the antimicrobial activity of the extract from the leaves of r. officinalis may be ascribed mainly to the action of 2 and 3.

AB  == in the present work, the anticariogenic activities of nine labdane type-diterpenes and four sesquiterpenes were investigated. among these metabolites, (-)-copalic acid (ca) was the most active compound displaying mic values very promising (ranging from 2.0 to 6.0 microg/ml) against the main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: streptococcus salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis and lactobacillus casei. time kill assays performed with ca against the primary causative agent (s. mutans) revealed that, in the first 12 h, this compound only inhibits the growth of the inoculum (bacteriostatic effect). however, its bactericidal effect is clearly noted thereafter (between 12 and 24 h). also, ca did not show a synergistic effect when combined with the anticariogenic gold standard (chlorhexidine, chd) in the checkerboard assays against s. mutans. in conclusion, the results points out ca as an important metabolite in the search for new effective anticariogenic agents.

TI  == a preliminary study of biological characteristics of streptococcus oligofermentans in oral microecology.
AB  == this study was designed to explore the biological characteristics of a new oral streptococcus species streptococcus oligofermentans. plaque samples were collected from caries-free and caries-active subjects. s. oligofermentans was selectively grown on mitis salivarius agar plates and identified by using 2-step  pcr and was isolated from 38% of 18 subjects. isolates were found mostly on healthy tooth surfaces. s. oligofermentans had weaker abilities in acid production and demineralizing hydroxyapatite. when streptococcus mutans was coincubated with s. oligofermentans, total number, acid production and calcium release were significantly inhibited. in conclusion, inhibition of s. mutans could be a beneficial biological characteristic of s. oligofermentans in oral microecology.

TI  == streptococcus mutans inhibits candida albicans hyphal formation by the fatty acid signaling molecule trans-2-decenoic acid (sdsf).
AB  == in the human mouth, fungi and several hundred species of bacteria coexist. here we report a case of interkingdom signaling in the oral cavity: a compound excreted by the caries bacterium streptococcus mutans inhibits the morphological  transition from yeast to hyphae, an important virulence trait, in the opportunistic fungus candida albicans. the compound excreted by s. mutans was originally studied because it inhibited signaling by the universal bacterial signal autoinducer-2 (ai-2), determined by the luminescence of a vibrio harveyi sensor strain. the inhibitor was purified from cell-free culture supernatants of  s. mutans guided by its activity. its chemical structure was elucidated by using  nmr spectroscopy and gc-ms and proved to be trans-2-decenoic acid. we show that trans-2-decenoic acid does not inhibit ai-2-specific signaling, but rather the luciferase reaction used for its detection. a potential biological role of trans-2-decenoic acid was then discovered. it is able to suppress the transition  from yeast to hyphal morphology in the opportunistic human pathogen candida albicans at concentrations that do not affect growth. the expression of hwp1, a hyphal-specific signature gene of c. albicans, is abolished by trans-2-decenoic acid. trans-2-decenoic acid is structurally similar to the diffusible signal factor (dsf) family of interkingdom-signaling molecules and is the first member of this family from a gram-positive organism (streptococcus dsf, sdsf). sdsf activity was also found in s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. sanguinis, but not in other oral bacteria. sdsf could be relevant in shaping multispecies candida bacteria biofilms in the human body.

TI  == mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  == the oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. when this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. the mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the streptococcus (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis) and staphylococcus (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. in addition, some members of both the streptococcus and the staphylococcus genera, as well as porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. the current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. the pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.

TI  == [dissertations 25 years after date 21. enhancing resistance to bacteria with chlorhexidine varnish and probiotics].
AB  == the aim of the research described in 'chemotherapy against streptococcus mutans'  was to increase colonization resistance against mutans streptococci by inoculating actinomyces naeslundii on the dentition. actinomyces naeslundii established better after chlorhexidine application than after dental cleansing only but did not exceed the 1% level of the total actinomyces population. this was insufficient to increase the colonization resistance against mutans streptococci. a 33% chlorhexidine varnish was developed. after a single short-term application of the varnish all plaque bacteria were erased. after several hours streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis  and streptococcus gordonii re-established on the surface. actinomyces naeslundii  recovered later, but often with higher numbers. mutans streptococci remained suppressed for months. this led to less acid production in dental plaque and caries reduction. the combination of mechanical cleansing and varnish application resulted in additional pocket reduction. recently, attention is also established  for research on the application ofprobiotics in periodotology.

TI  == diagnodent measurements of cultures of selected oral bacteria and demineralized enamel.
AB  == objective: carious tissue fluoresces with a wavelength different from sound tissue when stimulated by light with a wavelength of 655 nm. this difference is thought to have a bacterial origin rather than indicating demineralization. this  study aimed to measure fluorescence emitted by normal cultivable caries-associated bacterial flora and typical porphyrin-producing bacteria with diagnodent, and to verify earlier findings that demineralization of the dental hard tissue does not affect diagnodent readings. material and methods: bacterial  samples were collected from five occlusal caries lesions in three subjects. from  these, mixed anaerobic flora, lactobacilli and mutans streptococci were cultured  in up to three different kinds of culture medium. colonies of lactobacilli and mutans streptococci were also measured after transferring them to glass slides. laboratory teaching strains of prevotella spp., porphyromonas gingivalis and actinomyces odontolyticus were cultured anaerobically and fluorescence measured directly after an appropriate incubation period. sound enamel surfaces of 15 extracted premolars were demineralized and changes in fluorescence measured. results: diagnodent readings > 20 were only obtained from young colonies of prevotella and from colonies of mutans streptococci cultured on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. higher measurements were obtained as the bacterial colonies aged. lower measurements were obtained after transferring colonies to glass slides. demineralization of enamel did not affect the diagnodent measurements. conclusions: the change in fluorescence measured with diagnodent has a bacterial origin rather than occurring as a result of demineralization. the measurements are presumably dependent on bacterial metabolites rather than bacteria themselves, and probably record synergistic effects during the carious process rather than the quantity or species of bacteria involved.

AB  == streptococci, enterococci and streptococcus-like bacteria are frequent etiologic  agents of infective endocarditis and correct species identification can be a laboratory challenge. viridans streptococci (vs) not seldomly cause contamination of blood cultures. vitek 2 and partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene were applied in order to compare the results of both methods. strains originated from  two groups of patients: 149 strains from patients with infective endocarditis and 181 strains assessed as blood culture contaminants. of the 330 strains, based on  partial 16s rrna gene sequencing results, 251 (76%) were vs strains, 10 (3%) were pyogenic streptococcal strains, 54 (16%) were e. faecalis strains and 15 (5%) strains belonged to a group of miscellaneous catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci. among vs strains, respectively, 220 (87,6%) and 31 (12,3%) obtained agreeing and non-agreeing identifications with the two methods with respect to allocation to the same vs group. non-agreeing species identification mostly occurred among strains in the contaminant group, while for endocarditis strains notably fewer disagreeing results were observed.only 67 of 150 strains in the mitis group strains obtained identical species identifications by the two methods. most vs strains belonging to the groups of salivarius, anginosus, and mutans obtained agreeing species identifications with the two methods, while this only was the case for 13 of the 21 bovis strains. pyogenic strains (n=10), enterococcus faecalis strains (n=54) and a miscellaneous group of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci (n=15) seemed well identified by both methods, except that disagreements in identifications in the miscellaneous group  of strains occurred for 6 of 15 strains.

TI  == a novel pheromone quorum-sensing system controls the development of natural competence in streptococcus thermophilus and streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == in streptococcal species, the key step of competence development is the transcriptional induction of comx, which encodes the alternative sigma factor sigma(x), which positively regulates genes necessary for dna transformation. in streptococcus species belonging to the mitis and mutans groups, induction of comx relies on the activation of a three-component system consisting of a secreted pheromone, a histidine kinase, and a response regulator. in streptococcus thermophilus, a species belonging to the salivarius group, the oligopeptide transporter ami is essential for comx expression under competence-inducing conditions. this suggests a different regulation pathway of competence based on the production and reimportation of a signal peptide. the objective of our work was to identify the main actors involved in the early steps of comx induction in  s. thermophilus lmd-9. using a transcriptomic approach, four highly induced early competence operons were identified. among them, we found a rgg-like regulator (ster_0316) associated with a nonannotated gene encoding a 24-amino-acid hydrophobic peptide (shp0316). through genetic deletions, we showed that these two genes are essential for comx induction. moreover, addition to the medium of synthetic peptides derived from the c-terminal part of shp0316 restored comx induction and transformation of a shp0316-deficient strain. these peptides also induced competence in s. thermophilus and streptococcus salivarius strains that are poorly transformable or not transformable. altogether, our results show that  ster_0316 and shp0316, renamed comrs, are the two members of a novel quorum-sensing system responsible for comx induction in species from the salivarius group, which differs from the classical phosphorelay three-component system identified previously in streptococci.

TI  == the effect of the surface roughness of porcelain on the adhesion of oral streptococcus mutans.
AB  == aim: dental plaque has a harmful influence on periodontal tissue. when a porcelain restoration is fabricated and refinishing of the glazed surface is inevitable, the increase in surface roughness facilitates the adhesion of plaque  and its components. the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of  surface roughness of glazed or polished porcelain on the adhesion of oral streptococcus mutans. methods and materials: a total of 80 metal-ceramic specimens were prepared in the form of disks from two porcelain materials and divided into four groups according to the method of surface finishing. surface roughness values (ra-microm) for all specimens were recorded using a profilometer. s. mutans bacteria were isolated from saliva and all specimens were inoculated in test tubes containing a bacterial suspension allowing adhesion of the microorganisms to the specimens to occur. after incubation for 24 hours at 37 degrees c, the specimens were transferred to a sterile saline solution and an inoculum of 0.1 ml from each selected dilution was spread on the selective medium, mitis salivarius bacitracin agar (msb). bacterial counts, expressed in colony forming unit (cfu) taking into consideration the dilution factor, were recorded. results: there was significant correlation (p<0.05) between surface roughness values (ra-microm) and the amount of bacterial adhesion (cfu x 10(3)).  the glazed surface was the smoothest and exhibited the least amount of bacterial  adhesion. conclusion: a positive correlation between surface roughness and the amount of s. mutans adhesion was observed. the glazed porcelain surface was considered more biocompatible than other methods of porcelain surface finishing.  clinical significance: chairside adjustments of the cervical contour or occlusal  surface of porcelain restorations are sometimes necessary before or after cementation. ideally, an uncemented restoration should be returned to the laboratory for reglazing after all adjustments have been completed. it is important to evaluate various polishing procedures used for these adjusted surfaces to achieve a finished surface that as closely as possible approximates the quality of glazed porcelain.

TI  == horizontal transmission of mutans streptococci in children.
AB  == it has not been established whether transmission of mutans streptococci occurs between unrelated children older than 4 years of age. the aim of the study was to investigate the possible transmission of mutans streptococci genotypes from child to child in kindergarten. we studied 96 children (ages 5-6 yrs) in three san francisco bay area public schools. mutans streptococci colonies from each child were isolated from selective culture on mitis salivarius sucrose bacitracin agar. we used arbitrary primed polymerase chain reactions to determine the mutans streptococci genotypes. two children (not siblings) in each of the three schools  (6%) shared an identical amplitype of s. mutans, unique to each pair. the 19 s. sobrinus amplitypes were found in 12 children, and all were unique to each child. the presence of matching genotypes of s. mutans demonstrates horizontal transmission of this species between unrelated children aged 5-6 years.

TI  == partial recn gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus streptococcus.
AB  == partial sequences of the recn gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. the partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. the mean dna sequence similarity of recn gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be  lower than those of the 16s rrna gene (94.1 %), rpob (84.6 %), soda (74.8 %), groel (78.1 %) and gyrb (73.2 %). phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: streptococcus salivarius, s. equinus, s. hyovaginalis/s. pluranimalium/s. thoraltensis, s. pyogenes, s. mutans and s. suis. the 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: streptococcus sanguinis/s. cristatus/s. sinensis, s. anginosus/s. intermedius/s. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and s. mitis/s. infantis/s. peroris/s. oralis/s. oligofermentans/s. pneumoniae/s. pseudopneumoniae. the partial recn gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. this observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groel, gyrb, rpob and soda). a high percentage of similarity was found between s. intermedius and s. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recn gene. to study the genetic  diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recn, groel, soda, gyrb and rpob sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. the results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.

TI  == evolutionary relationships among salivarius streptococci as inferred from multilocus phylogenies based on 16s rrna-encoding, reca, seca, and secy gene sequences.
AB  == background: streptococci are divided into six phylogenetic groups, i.e, anginosus, bovis, mitis, mutans, pyogenic, and salivarius, with the salivarius group consisting of only three distinct species. two of these species, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis, are members of the normal human oral microflora whereas the third, streptococcus thermophilus, is found in bovine milk. given that s. salivarius and s. vestibularis share several  physiological characteristics, in addition to inhabiting the same ecosystem, one  would assume that they would be more closely related to each other than to s. thermophilus. however, the few phylogenetic trees published so far suggest that s. vestibularis is more closely related to s. thermophilus. to determine whether  this phylogenetic relationship is genuine, we performed phylogenetic inferences derived from seca and secy, the general secretion housekeeping genes, reca, a gene from a separate genetic locus that encodes a major component of the homologous recombinational apparatus, and 16s rrna-encoding gene sequences using  other streptococcal species as outgroups. results: the maximum likelihood (ml) and maximum parsimony (mp) phylogenetic inferences derived from the seca and reca gene sequences provided strong support for the s. vestibularis/s. thermophilus sister-relationship, whereas 16s rrna-encoding and secy-based analyses could not  discriminate between alternate topologies. phylogenetic analyses derived from the concatenation of these sequences unambiguously supported the close affiliation of s. vestibularis and s. thermophilus. conclusion: our results corroborated the sister-relationship between s. vestibularis and s. thermophilus and the concomitant early divergence of s. salivarius at the base of the salivarius lineage.

TI  == antagonistic action of indigenous streptococcus mutans strains.
AB  == dental caries is an infectious process which ultimately destroys the tooth. streptococcus mutans is considered to be the main agent causing this disease. if  microorganisms with antagonistic action on s. mutans were found, they might provide a way of avoiding or controlling the disease. within the framework of the oral microbial ecology approach, the aim of this project was to identify s. mutans strains with antagonistic effect upon s. mutans. saliva samples were taken from 66 children and cultured on blood agar and mitis salivarius bacitracin agar. they were incubated at 37 degrees c in anaerobic atmosphere for 48 hours, after which bacteria were counted and biochemical tests performed on colonies compatible with s. mutans. antagonistic effect was determined using the double layer in agar technique. in children without and with caries, the frequency of s. mutans was 91.7% and 96.7%, respectively. in the group of patients without caries, only two strains had no antagonistic action, and three strains had full antagonistic action (100%), while the rest showed different kinds of inhibitory action. in the group of patients with caries, only 5 strains had no antagonistic  action, 32 strains had full antagonistic action (100%) and the rest had variable  inhibitory action. to conclude, 112 s. mutans strains with high antagonistic potential were identified, which, after other requirements are fulfilled, could be used in caries prevention or control strategies.

TI  == poisson analysis of streptococcal bond-strengthening on saliva-coated enamel.
AB  == the forces responsible for bond-strengthening in initial oral bacterial adhesion  are unknown. since lifshitz-van der waals and electrostatic forces work instantaneously upon approach, it is hypothesized that bond-strengthening is governed by hydrogen bonding. poisson analysis of adhesion forces observed during the retraction of bacterial probes from surfaces in atomic force microscopy can be used to analyze the nature of the adhesion forces. streptococcal adhesion forces increased from about -0.7 to -10.3 nn when the contact time between cell surfaces and salivary films on enamel was increased from 0 to 120 sec. initial and final adhesion forces were stronger for initial colonizers of tooth surfaces  (s. mitis, s. sanguinis) than for later, more cariogenic, strains (s. sobrinus, s. mutans). retraction curves after increased contact times showed minor peaks, representative of hydrogen bonds, and poisson analyses indicated repulsive non-specific forces of around +0.3 nn and slightly more attractive hydrogen-bonding forces (-1.0 nn) for initial than for late colonizers (-0.8 nn).

TI  == oral streptococcus species in pre-term and full-term children - a longitudinal study.
AB  == background: despite high clinical significance, the microbiology of the dental biofilm in young children remains poorly understood. aim: the aim of this longitudinal study was to investigate five streptoccocus species commonly found in the oral biofilm of children, namely streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, and streptococcus salivarius to determine their relative numbers in caries-free pre-term children,  and age-matched full-term controls. design: plaque and saliva samples were obtained from 15 pre-term children and 15 age-matched controls at ages 3, 6, 12,  18, and 24 months. a quantitative real-time pcr technique was used to determine the numbers of five species of streptococcus using probes and primers specific for each bacterial species. results: all species of streptococcus generally increased from ages 3 to 24 months. the relative ratios of the bacteria remained  fairly constant at all ages studied (p > 0.1). there were no significant differences in numbers of all streptococcus species between pre-term children and full-term controls at all the ages investigated between. conclusion: the results  show that the relative numbers of s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, and s. salivarius remain relatively constant from 3 to 24 months of age in caries-free pre- and full-term children.

TI  == oral bacterial adhesion forces to biomaterial surfaces constituting the bracket-adhesive-enamel junction in orthodontic treatment.
AB  == bacterial adhesion to biomaterial surfaces constituting the bracket-adhesive-enamel junction represents a growing problem in orthodontics, because bacteria can adversely affect treatment by causing demineralization of the enamel surface around the brackets. it is important to know the forces with which bacteria adhere to the surfaces of these junction materials, as the strength of these forces will determine how easy it will be to remove the bacteria. we compared the adhesion forces of five initially colonizing and four cariogenic strains of bacteria to an orthodontic adhesive, stainless steel, and enamel, with and without a salivary conditioning film. adhesion forces were determined using atomic force microscopy and a bacterial probe. in the absence of a salivary conditioning film, the strongest bacterial adhesion forces occurred to the adhesive surface (-2.9 to -6.9 nn), while adhesion forces to the enamel surfaces were lowest (-0.8 to -2.7 nn). in the presence of a salivary conditioning film, adhesion forces were reduced strongly, to less than 1 nn, and  the differences between the various materials were reduced. generally, however, initial colonizers of dental hard surfaces presented stronger adhesion forces to  the different materials (-4.7 and -0.6 nn in the absence and presence of a salivary conditioning film, respectively) than cariogenic strains (-1.8 and -0.5  nn).

TI  == frequency and distribution of mutans streptococci in dental plaque from caries-free and caries-affected venezuelan children.
AB  == mutans streptococci, in particular s. mutans and s. sobrinus, are generally considered to be the prime etiological bacteria of human dental caries. the aim of this study was to determine the frequency of mutans streptococci in dental plaque in three groups of caries-free and caries-affected venezuelan children aged 2-6, 7-12, 13-19 years, and their possible association with dental caries. the frequency of mutans streptococci was determined in samples of pooled dental plaque collected from all detectable sources of 30 (62.5%) caries-affected and 18 (37.5%) caries-free children. the samples were collected from all available tooth sites using a hollenbak probe and immediately suspended in ringer's solution, serially diluted and cultured in mitis salivarius (ms) agar for total streptococci determination and mitis salivarius bacitracin (msb) for isolation of mutans streptococci. the bacterial identification procedure was done using the api rapid strep system. the criteria used to determine dmft and dmft was established by klein and palmer (1941). mean dmft and dmft were 6.4 +/- 3.2 and 4.4 +/- 2.9, respectively. ten (33%) out of 30 caries-affected children harbored  mutans streptococci. the species most frequently found were s. mutans (20%), s. sobrinus (10%) and s. rattus (3.3%). meanwhile, in the caries-free group only 6 out of 18 children (33%) harbored mutans streptococci, specifically s. mutans and s. sobrinus, both at 17%, with no significant difference between the two groups.  these results indicate that the percentage of children that harbored mutans streptococci was similar in both groups, suggesting that other acidogenic species may be responsible for caries development.

TI  == the immune response of oral epithelial cells induced by single-species and complex naturally formed biofilms.
AB  == introduction: in the oral cavity, the surfaces are constantly exposed to a complex variety of microorganisms organized in biofilms. as part of a sophisticated local immune response, gingival epithelial cells (gecs) express antimicrobial peptides, such as human beta-defensin-2 (hbd-2), ribonuclease 7 (rnaase-7), and psoriasin (pso), and pro-inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-8 (il-8) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-lo). the aim of the present study was  to test whether gecs show a differential immune response to single-species biofilms compared with multi-species biofilms. methods: gecs were cultured from biopsies derived from three different healthy donors (n = 3). to obtain naturally formed biofilm (nfb), polymer disks were attached to prostheses and carried intraorally for 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. in addition, single-species biofilms (ssb;  streptococcus mutans and streptococcus mitis) were cultured on polymer disks in vitro (12, 24, 36, and 48 h). the messenger rna (mrna) expression of hbd-2, rnaase-7, pso, il-8, 5-lo, and glycerylaldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was analysed using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. results: in gecs, the hbd-2 mrna expression was significantly upregulated in response to s. mitis-biofilm stimulation compared with s. mutans-biofilm stimulation (p < 0.0001). in contrast, the rnaase-7 mrna expression was significantly higher in gecs when responding to both s. mutans biofilms and naturally formed biofilms compared with s. mitis biofilms (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.001, respectively). the il-8 and 5-lo mrna was significantly upregulated in response to s. mutans biofilms (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0002, respectively). conclusion: this in vitro study found biofilm-dependent expression of antimicrobial peptides and inflammatory mediators in gecs.

TI  == effects of alpha-amylase and its inhibitors on acid production from cooked starch by oral streptococci.
AB  == this study evaluated acid production from cooked starch by streptococcus mutans,  streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus mitis, and the  effects of alpha-amylase inhibitors (maltotriitol and acarbose) and xylitol on acid production. streptococcal cell suspensions were anaerobically incubated with various carbohydrates that included cooked potato starch in the presence or absence of alpha-amylase. subsequently, the fall in ph and the acid production rate at ph 7.0 were measured. in addition, the effects of adding alpha-amylase inhibitors and xylitol to the reaction mixture were evaluated. in the absence of  alpha-amylase, both the fall in ph and the acid production rate from cooked starch were small. on the other hand, in the presence of alpha-amylase, the ph fell to 3.9-4.4 and the acid production rate was 0.61-0.92 micromol per optical density unit per min. these values were comparable to those for maltose. when using cooked starch, the fall in ph by s. sanguinis and s. mitis was similar to that by s. mutans and s. sobrinus. for all streptococci, alpha-amylase inhibitors caused a decrease in acid production from cooked starch, although xylitol only decreased acid production by s. mutans and s. sobrinus. these results suggest that cooked starch is potentially acidogenic in the presence of alpha-amylase, which occurs in the oral cavity. in terms of the acidogenic potential of cooked starch, s. sanguinis and s. mitis were comparable to s. mutans and s. sobrinus. alpha-amylase inhibitors and xylitol might moderate this activity.

AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the levels of secretory iga (siga), ph, flow rates, mutans streptococci (ms) and candida in saliva of children with rampant caries compared to those caries-free. thirty children (age 62-123 months) were enrolled and divided into two groups: group i, children with rampant caries, group ii, caries-free children. the average salivary flow rate was measured from  the volume yielded within 5 minutes and the ph was determined using a ph-electrode. measurement of siga was performed using an immunoassay kit. the levels of ms and candida were determined by culture on mitis-salivarius bacitracin agar and sabouraud dextrose agar. it was found that children with rampant caries presented with significantly higher levels of salivary siga, ms and candida. however, the mean values for salivary flow rates and ph were similar between the groups. the results reveal that children with rampant caries had significantly higher levels of siga, ms and candida in their oral cavities. this  finding tends to support the hypothesis that higher levels of salivary siga may reflect a past exposure of the host to cariogenic microorganisms.

AB  == objective: we aimed to compare the effect of sodium fluoride and chlorhexidine on salivary levels of mutans streptococci (ms), in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial. methods: thirty-five healthy volunteers, aged 4-8 years, with at  least one active carious lesion and no previous history of allergies were selected to participate in the study. a gel formulation containing either 1.23% sodium fluoride or 1% chlorhexidine was topically administered to the dentition every 24 h for 6 consecutive days. salivary ms levels were measured at baseline (d1) and on the 6th (d6), 15th (d15), and 30th (d30) days. for microbiological analysis, mitis salivarius-bacitracin agar medium was used. results: difference between treatments was only verified on d6. on the last day of treatment 1% chlorhexidine gel was significantly more effective than fluoride (p = 0.0000). the use of sodium fluoride did not cause a statistically significant variation in salivary ms levels throughout the duration of the study. following treatment, a subsequent increase in ms counts between d6 and d15 (p = 0.0001) was observed with chlorhexidine. conclusion: a 6-day treatment with a 1% chlorhexidine gel was effective in reducing salivary ms; there was a significant ms increase once treatment was suspended. the use of 1.23% sodium fluoride under the same regimen  was not able to reduce salivary ms levels. our results suggest repeated treatment with 1% chlorhexidine as a means for maintaining low salivary ms levels in children with dental caries.

TI  == streptococcus cristatus attenuates fusobacterium nucleatum-induced interleukin-8  expression in oral epithelial cells.
AB  == background and objective: oral epithelial cells may be invaded by a polymicrobial intracellular flora, including pathogens together with commensals. various oral pathogens can induce the production of interleukin-8, a potent neutrophil chemotractant, in oral epithelial cells. evidence from the gut suggests that commensal species may modulate inflammatory responses to pathogens. the aim of this study was to examine the interleukin-8 responses of oral epithelial cells to an oral pro-inflammatory species, fusobacterium nucleatum, in combination with an oral commensal, streptococcus cristatus. material and methods: kb, tert-2, tr146  and scc15 cells were cocultured with f. nucleatum and s. cristatus, either alone  or in combination, at 37 degrees c in 5% co2 under various conditions. the mrna expression of interleukin-8 was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay. results: f. nucleatum alone evoked a potent interleukin-8 response, whereas s. cristatus alone did not induce significant interleukin-8 expression in oral epithelial cells. when present together, s. cristatus attenuated the f. nucleatum-induced interleukin-8 production in the four oral epithelial cell lines to varying degrees. the inhibitory effect of s. cristatus was independent of its  viability and its co-aggregation with f. nucleatum, was not related to soluble bacterial products and appeared to require bacterial contact with epithelial cells. similar effects were seen with several other species of oral streptococci. conclusion: our data suggest that s. cristatus may exert immunomodulatory effects on the interleukin-8 response of oral epithelial cells to f. nucleatum challenge.

TI  == volatile components of camellia sinensis inhibit growth and biofilm formation of  oral streptococci in vitro.
AB  == this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of semi fermented and non fermented camellia sinensis extracts (black and green tea) and comparison between them against streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, s. mitis atcc 9811 and s. sanguis atcc 10556 that are responsible for dental caries and bacteremias following dental manipulations. minimum inhibitory concentrations of both tea extracts were assessed by well diffusion and broth dilution methods and examination of cell adherence (biofilm inhibitory concentrations) was observed on glass slides under  phase contrast microscope and colony counts from glass beads. concentration of 1  mg ml(-1) of semi fermented tea extract was completely biofilm inhibitor but biofilm formation by these bacteria was seen 7 days after treatment with 1 mg ml(-1) of non fermented camellia sinensis on glass beads and bic for oral streptococci treated with this extract was 1.5, 2.5 mg ml(-1) of semi fermented and 3 mg ml(-1) of non fermented extracts had bactericidal effect on these bacteria. semi fermented and non fermented camellia sinensis extracts were able to prevent growth of oral streptococci. therefore dental caries significantly reduce and the efficiency of semi fermented tea was higher due to rich content of volatile components rather than non fermented extracts.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of kaurane diterpenes against oral pathogens.
AB  == two kaurane diterpenes, ent-kaur-16(17)-en-19-oic acid (ka) and 15-beta-isovaleryloxy-ent-kaur-16(17)-en-19-oic acid (ka-ival), isolated from aspilia foliacea, and the methyl ester derivative of ka (ka-me) were evaluated against oral pathogens. ka was the most active compound, with mic values of 10 microg ml(-1) against the following microorganisms: streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, and lactobacillus casei. however, ka did not show significant activity against streptococcus salivarius and enterococcus faecalis, with mic values equal to 100  and 200 microg ml(-1), respectively. our results show that ka has potential to be used as a prototype for the discovery of new effective anti-infection agents against microorganisms responsible for caries and periodontal diseases. moreover, these results allow to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to studies on the structure-activity relationship of this type of metabolites with respect to caries and periodontal diseases.

TI  == a quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  == objectives: toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. this can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. in this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. methods: fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. microorganisms were enumerated and identified. bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated pbs solution  for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. results: counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) cfu. candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. no obligate anaerobes were isolated. members of streptococcaceae family were regularly found  (65.2%) belonging to the following species: streptococcus pyogenes, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. sobrinus, s. viridans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, aerococcus viridans. a. viridans and s. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were found on adults  brushes. escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. and enterococcus sp., were also recovered. we found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. however, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. conclusions: ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.

TI  == colonization of mutans streptococci in costa rican children from a high-risk population.
AB  == purpose: the aim of the study was to determine the colonization of mutans streptococci (ms) in dental biofilm and saliva of children from a high-risk population with low socioeconomic status from san jose, costa rica. methods: a total of 68 healthy babies from 8 to 20 months of age (mean age=13 months), with  caries-free status and cariogenic feeding habits (eg, nursing bottle- or breast-feeding on demand) were examined. children divided in two groups (<13 months and 14-20 months). samples from dental biofilm and saliva from each subject were processed and plated in blood agar (ba) and mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar (msb) to determine ms percentage. statistical analysis included the analysis of variance test, and stratification by age of ms  levels. results: detectable ms levels in dental biofilm and saliva were found in  75% and 72% of children, respectively. counts higher than 20000 colony forming units (cfu) per ml were found in 4% of saliva and in 35% of biofilm samples. the  two groups showed significant differences in ms levels for dental biofilm (p=.036) and saliva (p=.009). children older than 17 months presented higher ms levels (p<.05). analysis by ms levels (<0.1%; 0.1-1.0%;>1.0% of ms) the two groups showed an insignificant association with increasing mean age. ms density was associated with mean number of erupted primary molars. conclusions: mutans streptococci colonization of dental biofilm and saliva from high caries risk infants is associated with age and dental development.

TI  == [effects of oral streptococci on biofilm formation by cariogenic bacteria in dual species cultures].
AB  == the effects of oral commensal streptococci (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus salivarius) on biofilm formation by cariogenic mutans streptococci (streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus) were investigated. cell suspensions were cultured on 96-well microtiter plates coated with or without salivary components (sc), and in flow cell systems coated with sc in tryptic soy broth including 0.25% sucrose without dextrose (tsb). the resultant biofilm formations were stained using safranin or a live/dead baclight viability kit, and examined with absorbance at 492 nm or using confocal laser scanning microscopy. mutans streptococci and s. sanguinis biofilms were formed significantly on the polystyrene surfaces in tsb.  further, in combination cultures, s. sanguinis formed a sufficient biofilm when cultured with s. mutans. however, when s. sanguinis was cultured with s. sobrinus, biofilm formation was slightly inhibited. s. gordonii also inhibited biofilm formation in the culture with s. sobrinus, but not when cultured with s.  mutans. s. mitis and s. salivarius collapsed the biofilm morphology and inhibited volume development in some conditions when cultured with s. mutans or s. sobrinus. biofilm formation by mutans streptococci was challenged and collapsed on the whole by culturing with each of the other oral streptococci. these results indicate that co-culturing of multiple species of mutans streptococci and other oral streptococci has physical effects related to previous attachment and colonization on the surface, as well as biological effects to regulate biofilm formation.

TI  == role of sucrose in the fitness of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == introduction: dental caries has been closely linked to fermentable carbohydrates  as key environmental factors. sucrose has been identified as the most cariogenic  carbohydrate. streptococcus mutans, considered to be the primary pathogen causing dental caries, is able to utilize sucrose as a nutrient source, partially for the production of intracellular storage components and for the production of extracellular glucans via the glucosyltransferases gtfb, gtfc, and gtfd. the following study explores the competitiveness and fitness of s. mutans when grown  with different concentrations of sucrose. methods: growth competition with oral streptococci and antimicrobial susceptibility in static biofilm models grown without sucrose or with 0.1% or 0.5% sucrose were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy. the numbers of surviving s. mutans of both wild-type and an isogenic gtf-negative mutant after antimicrobial treatment were determined as colony-forming units. results: s. mutans was able to establish microcolonies with increasing sucrose concentration in the presence of other streptococcal competitors during biofilm development. the antimicrobial susceptibility decreased when sucrose was available as substrate and was dependent on the presence of the gtfs. conclusion: the increased resistance against antimicrobial  treatment was associated with the availability of sucrose, but was not influenced much by the concentration used during this study. the resistance was strongly associated with the gtf activity, excluding any intracellular metabolic effect of sucrose in the resistance mechanism.

TI  == coronal microleakage of two root-end filling materials using a polymicrobial marker.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate polymicrobial coronal leakage of mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) and amalgam. there were 108 single-rooted teeth  randomly divided into 3 groups of 32 teeth each and positive and negative control groups of 6 teeth and obturated with gutta percha and either diaket (3m/espe, seefeld, germany), ah plus (dentsply, de trey, konstanz, germany), or ketac endo  (3m/espe). these groups were further divided into 2 subgroups of 16 teeth in which root ends were resected and obturated with either mta or zinc-free amalgam. the samples have been incorporated in a dual-chamber leakage model with a polymicrobial marker of five facultative anaerobes on the coronal part. leakage was observing during a period of 90 days. the least leakage was found in a combination of diaket and mta (76.9 +/-14.8 days) followed by ah plus and mta (66.1 +/- 18.7), diaket and amalgam (60.0 +/- 23.1), ah plus and amalgam (56.9 +/- 22.1), and ketac endo and mta (42.1 +/- 17.8), whereas the greatest leakage was observed in the ketac endo and amalgam group (40.0 +/- 17.24). samples filled with mta showed significantly better sealing than samples filled with amalgam (p  < 0.05).

TI  == prevalence of bacteraemia following third molar surgery.
AB  == objective: to investigate the prevalence and aetiology of bacteraemia following third molar extractions (b-tme), analysing the factors affecting its development. methods: the study group was formed of 100 patients undergoing third molar extractions under general anaesthesia. peripheral venous blood samples were collected at baseline, 30 s after a mandibular third molar extraction and 15 min  after completing the final extraction. samples were inoculated into bactec aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles and were processed in the bact/alert. subculture and further identification of the bacteria isolated was performed using conventional microbiological techniques. results: the prevalence of bacteraemia following third molar surgery was 62% at 30 s after the first dental  extraction and 67% at 15 min after finishing the final extraction. the bacteria most frequently identified in the positive blood cultures were streptococcus viridans (87.9%). conclusion: in our series, the prevalence of b-tme at 30 s after a single third molar extraction was high, principally being of streptococcal aetiology, and was independent of the oral health status and the magnitude of the surgical procedure. positive blood cultures persisted for at least 15 min after three to four dental extractions in a higher number of patients, questioning the supposedly transient nature of bacteraemia following dental extractions.

TI  == new culture media for the isolation of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus in  the saliva of head- and neck-irradiated patients.
AB  == the reduction in salivary flow in patients subjected to head and neck irradiation induces changes in the oral microflora and increases the risk of oral mucosal infections. the frequent presence of fungi, particularly candida, in the oral environment of these patients complicates identification of the most important cariogenic bacteria with the commercial crt bacteria (ivoclar vivadent) culture media. such identification is important for the application of chemical measures  to control cariogenic bacteria in these patients, since it has been shown that simple fluoride application is unable to control caries in this population. objective: the aim of this study was to obtain a simple medium that inhibits candida spp. growth and allows the specific growth of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp. thus, reliable counts of cariogenic species can be achieved. materials and methods: stimulated saliva samples from 30 head- and neck-radiotherapy patients were seeded in commercial crt bacteria culture medium  and in two different media designed by our group: mitis salivarius bacitracin agar (msba), containing 5% potassium tellurite and fluconazole 64 microg/ml (msbtpf) for the isolation of streptococcus; and man, rogosa and sharpe (mrs) agar, containing bacitracin 0.2 u/ml and fluconazole 32 microg/ml (mrsbf) for the isolation of lactobacillus spp. results: candida growth was inhibited 100% in the media developed in this study. in all the samples seeded, growing of colonies in  mrsbf was identified as lactobacillus, while in crt bacteria for lactobacillus spp. this species was only isolated in 48.1% of the samples. s. mutans was identified in 71.4% of the colonies that grown in msbtpf medium, while in crt bacteria for s. mutans, this species was only identified in 35% of the colonies obtained. conclusion: the culture medium developed in the present study was able  to inhibit the 100% of candida spp. growth. these new media permit reliable counts of cariogenic bacteria in irradiated patients.

TI  == inhibitory activity of garlic (allium sativum) extract on multidrug-resistant streptococcus mutans.
AB  == garlic (allium sativum) extract has been known to have inhibitory activity on various pathogenic bacteria, viruses and fungi. the objective of present investigation was to study in vitro inhibitory activity of garlic extract on multidrug-resistant (mdr) strains of streptococcus mutans isolated from human carious teeth. filter sterilized aqueous extract of garlic was prepared and used  in the present study. for isolation of s. mutans, extracted human carious teeth were cultured in todd-hewit broth and mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. s. mutans was characterized by colony morphology, biochemical tests and other conventional  bacteriological procedures. disk sensitivity tests and broth dilution methods were used to determine antibiotic sensitivity profile and inhibitory activity of  garlic extract on s. mutans isolated from carious teeth. of 105 carious teeth tested, 92 (87.6%) isolates of s. mutans were recovered, among which 28 (30.4%) were mdr since they were resistant to four or more antibiotics. the highest rate  of resistance was observed for tetracycline (30.4%) and least resistance (0%) to  teichoplanin and vancomycin while 22.8% and 23.9% of the isolates were resistant  to penicillin and amoxicillin, respectively. chlorhexidine minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for mdr and non-mdr s. mutans varied from 2 to 16 microg ml(-1) and from 0.25 to 1 microg ml(-1), respectively (p<0.05). all isolates, mdr and non-mdr of s. mutans were sensitive to garlic extract with the mic ranging from 4 to 32 microg ml(-1). considering in vitro data obtained in the present study, mouthwashes or toothpaste containing optimum concentration of garlic extract could be used for prevention of dental caries.

TI  == in vitro inhibition of oral streptococci binding to the acquired pellicle by algal lectins.
AB  == aims: the initial colonization of the tooth by streptococci involves their attachment to adsorbed components of the acquired pellicle. avoiding this adhesion may be successful in preventing caries at early stages. salivary mucins  are glycoproteins that when absorbed onto hydroxyapatite may provide binding sites for certain bacteria. algal lectins may be especially interesting for oral  antiadhesion trials because of their great stability and high specificity for mucins. this work aimed to evaluate the potential of two algal lectins to inhibit the adherence of five streptococci species to the acquired pellicle in vitro. methods and results: the lectins used were extracted from bryothamnion triquetrum (btl) and bryothamnion seaforthii (bsl). fluorescence microscopy was applied to visualize the ability of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled lectins to attach to the pellicle and revealed a similar capability for both lectins. streptococcal adherence assays were performed using saliva-coated microtitre plates. bsl inhibited more than 75% of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sobrinus and streptococcus mutans adherence, achieving 92% to the latter. btl only obtained statistically significant results on s. mitis and s. sobrinus, whose adherence was decreased by 32.5% and 54.4%, respectively. conclusion: algal lectins are able to inhibit streptococcal adherence. significance and impact of the study: our results support the proposed application of lectins in antiadhesion therapeutics.

TI  == inhibition of bacterial adherence to saliva-coated through plant lectins.
AB  == in the present study, we evaluated the ability of lectin from talisia esculenta (tel) and a protein from labramia bojeri seeds (labramin) to inhibit adherence of microorganisms and exert antimicrobial effects. the minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of these proteins were determined using 5 species of  bacteria: streptococcus mutans ua159, streptococcus sobrinus 6715, streptococcus  sanguinis atcc10556, streptococcus mitis atcc903 and streptococcus oralis pb182.  in addition, an adherence assay was performed using these 5 bacterial species and sterile polystyrene microtiter plates coated with human saliva. filtered protein  solutions (6.25 to 100 mug/ml) were added to saliva-coated plates, and the plates were then incubated for 1 h at 37 degrees c. after incubation, the plates were washed, and a bacterial suspension (10(6 )cfu/ml) was then transferred to each plate, followed by incubation at 37 degrees c for 1 h (10% co(2)). adherence of bacteria to the acquired pellicle was visualized by staining with crystal violet, and absorbance was measured using a plate reader at 575 nm. neither labramin nor  tel, at any of the concentrations used, inhibited growth of any of the microorganisms. however, labramin inhibited adherence of s. mutans and s. sobrinus. the present results indicate that labramin is potentially useful as a biofilm-inhibiting drug.

TI  == isolation and characterization of the mutans streptococci from the dental plaques in koreans.
AB  == mutans streptococci have been implicated as cariogenic bacteria in dental caries  because they can produce high levels of dental caries-causing lactic acid and extracellular polysaccharide. the aim of this study was to isolate and characterize the mutans streptococci from the dental plaque obtained from koreans. the dental plaque samples were collected from the anterior and molar teeth of both jaws in 155 subjects (aged 2 to 33.2 years, average age 13.7+/-4.7  years). the samples were diluted by 100-fold in 1x pbs and plated on mitis-salivarius bacitracin (msb) agar plates. the mutans streptococci grown on msb plates were screened by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) targeting dextranase gene (dex). the mutans streptococci  were identified at the species level using a 16s rdna sequencing comparison method. the biochemical tests were carried out to biotype the mutans streptococci. ninety-five strains of the mutans streptococci out of 358 colonies, which were derived from 141 subjects, were isolated. of them, 77 strains and 18 strains were streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, respectively. the biotyping data showed that 62, 1, 20, 10, and 2 strains were biotypes i, ii, iv,  v and variant, respectively. of the two strains of variant biotype, one strains was similar to biotype iv except that it was positive to the arginine hydrolysis  test. we considered this one strain a new biotype, and classified it as biotype vii. in conclusion, s. mutans and its biotype i was most frequently isolated in korean dental plaque. the mutans streptococci strains isolated in this study might be useful for the study of the pathogenesis and the prevention of dental caries.

TI  == minimum inhibitory concentration of adherence of punica granatum linn (pomegranate) gel against s. mutans, s. mitis and c. albicans.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial effect of a punica granatum linn (pomegranate) phytotherapeutic gel and miconazole (daktarin oral gel) against three standard streptococci strains (mutans atcc 25175, sanguis atcc 10577 and mitis atcc 9811), s. mutans clinically isolated and candida albicans either alone or in association. the effect of minimum inhibitory concentrations of the gels on the adherence of these microorganisms to glass was assessed in the presence of 5% sucrose, using increasing and doubled concentrations of the diluted solution of the gels ranging from 1:1 to 1:1024. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of adherence of punica granatum l. gel against the test organisms  were: 1:16 for s. mutans (atcc), s. mutans (ci) and s. sanguis; 1:128 for s. mitis and 1:64 for c. albicans. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of adherence of miconazole against the same organisms were: 1:512, 1:64, 1:4, 1:128  and 1:16, respectively. in experiments with three and four associated microorganisms, the punica granatum l. gel had greater efficiency in inhibiting microbial adherence than the miconazole. the results of this study suggest that this phytotherapeutic agent might be used in the control of adherence of different microorganisms in the oral cavity.

TI  == clinical and microbiological effect of calcium hydroxide protection in indirect pulp capping in primary teeth.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate clinically and microbiologically the effect of calcium hydroxide (ch) on carious dentin on primary teeth submitted to indirect pulp capping (ipc). methods: twenty 4-7 year-old subjects with 42 treated teeth participated in the study. the treatment consisted of incomplete excavation of the demineralized dentin, application of a ch or gutta-percha (gp) layer and sealing with a resin-based composite for 4-7 months. after cavity preparation and sealing, the dentin was evaluated clinically (color and consistency) and microbiologically. dentin samples were cultured on blood agar under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, in mitis salivarius agar and rogosa sl agar. results: 39 teeth (20 in the ch group and 19 in the gp group) were reopened 4-7 months post-treatment for clinical and microbiological evaluation. in all teeth, the initial demineralized dentin was wet and soft or leathery. in the ch group, 10% of the lesions were yellow, 80% light brown and 10% dark brown and in the gp group, 94.7% were light brown and 5.3% dark brown. after treatment, the dentin was dry, 90% (group ch) and 84.2% (group gp) were dark brown. the final consistency was either leathery or hard. three samples in the ch group and five in group gp changed from soft to leathery; only one sample (gp) remained leathery. 85% in the ch group and 68.4% in gp group turned hard after treatment.  all bacterial counts decreased significantly by the end of treatment. in the ch group, the bacterial (log10 cfu + 1) anaerobic growth decreased from 4.84 +/- 1.31 to 1.35 +/- 1.54, aerobic from 4.09 +/- 1.04 to 0.92 +/- 1.30 and lactobacilli from 3.24 +/- 1.22 to 0.36 +/- 0.89, respectively; the mutans streptococci from 2.05 +/- 1.84 to 0.14 +/- 0.60. in gp group, anaerobic growth decreased from 5.22 +/- 0.96 to 2.02 +/- 1.65 and aerobic from 4.23 +/- 1.37 to 1.08 +/- 1.29 and lactobacilli from 2.06 +/- 1.81 to 0.00 +/- 0.00, respectively; the mutans streptococci from 3.16 +/- 1.59 to 0.28 +/- 0.84.

TI  == comparative analysis of a monoclonal antibody-based streptococcus mutans detection method with selective culture assays using polymerase chain reaction as a gold standard.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare a recently developed monoclonal antibody (mab)-based salivary streptococcus mutans detection method with various selective media using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) as the gold standard. salivary s. mutans cells were enumerated with a mab-based method, along with three commonly used selective media, mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar (msb), trypticase yeast-extract cystine sucrose bacitracin agar (tycsb), and glucose-sucrose-potassium tellurite-bacitracin (gstb) agar. statistical analysis  showed no significant correlations between each method. with pcr as the standard, a mab-based detection method was found to provide the highest sensitivity (91%) and specificity (96%) among these four methods. this study demonstrates that the  mab-based detection method may provide more accurate enumeration of salivary s. mutans than selective media.

TI  == evaluation of cariogenic bacteria.
AB  == objectives: the evaluation of mutans streptococci (ms) is one of the index for caries risk. dentocult(tm) and crt(tm) are commercial kits to detect and evaluate ms, conveniently. however, the evaluation of ms has also been carried out simply  using an instruction manual. but the instruction manual is not easy to use for evaluation of ms. the aim of this study was to examine the utility of modified mitis-salivalius bacitracin (msb) agar medium compared with msb agar medium and commercial kits, and to establish a convenient kit (mmsb-kit) using modified msb  agar. methods: the ms in stimulated saliva from 27 subjects were detected by msb, modified msb agar medium and commercial kits. laboratory and clinically isolated  strains of ms were similarly evaluated. the ratios of ms in detected bacteria were compared by elisa. results: the scores using an mmsb-kit on the basis of modified msb agar medium were tabulated. saliva samples showed different levels of ms between culture methods and the commercial kit. some samples which were full of ms were not detected by the commercial kit. the detection of ms by modified msb agar medium and mmsb-kit were significantly higher when compared with msb agar medium,crt(tm), (p< .01) and dentocult sm(tm) (p<.05). conclusion:  the sensitivity for detection of ms is higher for modified msb agar medium when compared with msb agar medium. the mmsb-kit can be used simply, and can be an important contributor for the evaluation of ms as a caries risk factor.

TI  == a modified dip-slide test for microbiological risk in caries assessment.
AB  == this study was undertaken to evaluate the validity of a new modified dip-slide test kit for the estimation of salivary mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and candida levels by comparison with the results obtained from conventional agar plate counts. five milliliters of paraffin-stimulated saliva sample was collected from 118 6-12-year old children attending 4 primary schools in thailand. saliva was poured over a 3-compartment slide containing mitis-salivarius bacitracin agar, rogosa agar and sabouraud dextrose agar. a slide was incubated in a 5% co2  incubator for 48 hours. the results of the modified test kit were compared with those from the conventional saliva sampling with dilution method. the salivary mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and candida counts obtained from the conventional methods were significantly correlated (p < 0.0001) with the modified dip-slide estimates of these organisms. (kendall tau = 0.71, 0.58 and 0.76, respectively). the correlation between a modified dip-slide test kit and the conventional method indicates that this new test kit is suitable for the screening of salivary mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and candida levels in patients. the test is simple and would be useful for the early selection of patients for dental examination. in addition, it would be a valuable educational  aid for the motivation and dietary counseling among children.

TI  == establishing a genetic system for ecological studies of streptococcus oligofermentans.
AB  == streptococcus oligofermentans is a newly characterized species belonging to the mitis group of oral streptococci. so far no correlation has been demonstrated between s. oligofermentans and dental caries. furthermore, a reverse correlation  has been observed between the number of s. oligofermentans and the number of streptococcus mutans, a major cariogenic pathogen, in the oral cavity. these properties suggest that s. oligofermentans may have a potential to be used as a 'probiotics' for caries prevention. in this study, we aim to establish a genetic  system in s. oligofermentans to further study the biology of this new species. using homologous regions of the comcde locus in other streptococci, the comc gene was isolated and sequenced. a synthetic competence-stimulating peptide (csp) was  synthesized and shown to be able to effectively induce competence in s. oligofermentans. this csp-induced transformation system in s. oligofermentans was used to construct green fluorescent protein (gfp) and luciferase (luc) reporter systems, both of which are driven by the lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) promoter. these reporter systems were further shown to be highly expressed in planktonic and biofilm cells, suggesting that these reporter systems can be used in future ecological studies of s. oligofermentans.

TI  == influence of a fluoride mouthrinse on mutans streptococci in schoolchildren.
AB  == this study aimed to determine whether the long-term use of a fluoride mouthrinse  affects the salivary levels of mutans streptococci. two hundred and fifteen schoolchildren (aged 9-10 years) participated. one hundred and forty-nine of these children had used a fluoride mouthrinse since 5 years of age at nursery school, and the remaining 66 children had not. dft (decayed and filled teeth) was recorded, and the salivary levels of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus were measured using mitis salivarius bacitracin agar. the group that had used a fluoride mouthrinse had a significantly lower prevalence of both s. mutans and s. sobrinus (p = 0.038) and a significantly lower dft score (p < 0.001) than  the other group. using logistic regression analysis including caries experience at baseline as a dependent variable, the odds ratio of carrying s. mutans alone was 8.0 (p = 0.066) and that of carrying both s. mutans and s. sobrinus was 16.5  (p = 0.022) in the group that had not used the fluoride mouthrinse. children carrying both s. mutans and s. sobrinus had a higher caries incidence in 1 year than the others, with odds ratios of 5.73 (p = 0.067) in the group with a fluoride mouthrinse and 3.47 (p = 0.035) in the group without it. these results show that the long-term use of a fluoride mouthrinse is associated with reduced salivary levels of mutans streptococci and this bacterial reduction may partly contribute to the suppression of dental caries in children using a long-term fluoride mouthrinse.

TI  == expression of the short fimbriae of porphyromonas gingivalis is regulated in oral bacterial consortia.
AB  == the mfa1 protein of porphyromonas gingivalis is the structural subunit of the short fimbriae and mediates coadhesion between p. gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii. we utilized a promoter-lacz reporter construct to examine the regulation of mfa1 expression in consortia with common oral plaque bacteria. promoter activity of mfa1 was inhibited by s. gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus mitis. in contrast, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus cristatus, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum did not affect mfa1 expression. expression of sspa/b, the streptococcal receptor for mfa1, was not required for regulation of mfa1 promoter activity. proteinaceous molecule(s) in oral streptococci may be responsible for regulation of mfa1 expression. porphyromonas gingivalis is capable of detecting heterologous organisms, and responds to selected organisms by specific gene regulation.

TI  == comparison of culture media and chairside assays for enumerating mutans streptococci.
AB  == aim: this study compared several traditional culture-based media and chairside cultural assays for ability to recover mutans streptococci (ms) from pure cultures and from saliva samples. methods and results: when pure cultures were used with traditional culture-based media, mitis-salivarius bacitracin (msb) agar demonstrated less support for bacterial recovery than trypticase-yeast extract-cysteine sucrose-bacitracin (tycsb) agar and the modified medium of ritz  (hlr-s). one species of ms, streptococcus ferus (c), was not recovered on msb medium. chairside cultural tests displayed considerable disparity between tests in recovering bacteria from pure cultures. on the glass adherence assay (mucount), s. ferus was not detected and streptococcus criceti was not detected on the dipslide assay (cariescreen sm) or on the plastic adherence assay (dentocult sm strip mutans). the frequency of isolation of pure strains of bacteria other than ms was common. from saliva samples, the frequency of isolation of ms on hlr-s and tycsb media and the glass adherence assay was 91-97%. the frequency of isolation on msb medium and on the dip-slide and plastic adherence assays was significantly decreased (37, 47 and 69%, respectively). recovery scores varied considerably among the culture methods studied and tended  to be highest on the hlr-s medium and on the glass adherence assay. conclusions:  growth and recovery profiles of pure bacterial cultures and of saliva samples for the ms varied according to different media. significance and impact of the study: caution should be exercised in comparing results between studies that employ different cultural methods for ms enumeration.

TI  == a lacticin 3147 enriched food ingredient reduces streptococcus mutans isolated from the human oral cavity in saliva.
AB  == aims: to isolate and characterise streptococcus mutans from irish saliva samples  and to assess their sensitivity to a food-grade preparation of the lantibiotic, lacticin 3147, produced by lactococcus lactis dpc3147. methods and results: saliva samples collected from children with varying oral health status were screened on mitis salivarius agar for the presence of pathogenic streptococci. following selective plating, 16s rdna sequencing and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), 15 distinct strains of strep. mutans were identified. these were grouped according to their relative sensitivity to lacticin 3147 which ranged from 0.78 to 6.25%; relative to a sensitive indicator strain, lactococcus  lactis ssp. lactis hp. inhibition of indicator strep. mutans strains from sensitive, intermediate and tolerant groupings were assessed in microtitre plate  assays with increasing concentrations of lacticin 3147. the concentration of lacticin 3147 required to give 50% growth inhibition correlated with their relative sensitivities (as assayed by well diffusion methodology) and ranged from 1280 to 5120 au ml(-1). concentrated preparations of lacticin 3147 caused a rapid killing of strep. mutans strains in broth. moreover, in human saliva deliberately spiked with strep. mutans, the pathogen was eliminated (initial inoculum of 10(5)) in the presence of 40,000 au ml(-1) of lacticin 3147. furthermore, a food-grade lacticin 3147 spray dried powder ingredient was assessed for the inhibition of strep. mutans in human saliva, spiked with a strain of intermediate sensitivity, resulting in up to a 4-log reduction in counts after 20 min. conclusion: a food grade preparation of lacticin 3147 was effective in the inhibition of oral strep. mutans. significance and impact of the study: the inhibition of oral streptococci by food grade preparations of lacticin 3147 may offer novel opportunities for the development of lacticin 3147 as an anti-cariogenic agent particularly in the area of functional foods for the improvement of oral health.

TI  == early acquisition of streptococcus mutans for children.
AB  == existing evidence reveals that in early oral infection the main route of transmission of streptococcus mutans is mother-child saliva contacts and that initial acquisition takes place during a specific period of time denominated "window of infectivity" that lapses between 6 and 30 months of the child's life,  with a higher risk between 18 and 30 months of age. the aim of the present study  was to analyze early oral infection. the levels of streptococcus mutans in saliva and bacterial plaque in the binomial mother-child 6 to 18 months after childbirth were evaluated. twenty-four mother-child binomials that attended the university hospital of maternity and neonatology of cordoba participated in the study. samples of saliva and dental plaque were taken from mother and child and seeded in selective agar mitis salivarius bacitracin medium (0.28 mg/ml) and cultured for 48 hours at 37 degrees c and in 5% co2 to allow for the growth of streptococcus mutans. the colonies were identified morphologically and biochemically. at 6 months after childbirth: 58.33% of the samples of the mother's saliva were positive, while the presence of the microorganism was not detected in 100% of the samples of the infants' saliva. at 18 months of after childbirth: 79.16% of the samples of saliva and 100% of the samples of the mothers' dental plaque were positive, whereas the samples of saliva and dental plaque of the infants were positive for streptococcus mutans in 20.83% and 70.83% of the cases respectively. the initial acquisition of streptococcus mutans would  have occurred in 20.8% of the children at the age of 18 months. eruption of primary molars occurs at this age.

TI  == effect of penicillin resistance on presentation and outcome of nonenterococcal streptococcal infective endocarditis.
AB  == background and aims: most cases of infective endocarditis are caused by nonenterococcal streptococci. the emergence of strains resistant to penicillin is increasingly recognized worldwide. this study sought to assess the effect of penicillin resistance on presentation and outcome of streptococcal endocarditis.  methods: a retrospective study was conducted in a single tertiary care hospital.  results: between august 1996 and december 2004, patients infected with nonenterococcal streptococcal endocarditis and known minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) to penicillin were included in this study. a total of 62 cases were identified: 48 (77%) cases of the streptococcal endocarditis were caused by viridans streptococci. the most common species groups identified were streptococcus mitis in 12 (19%) cases, streptococcus oralis in 9 (15%) cases, streptococcus sanguis in 7 (11%) cases and streptococcus mutans in 7 (11%) cases. there were 36 male and 26 female patients with a median age of 46 years (range: 1-85). twenty-two patients (35%) had peripheral embolization and 10 patients (16%) died in hospital. twenty-eight (45%) of the 62 patients were infected with  streptococcal strains of mics > or =0.125 microg/ml to penicillin. infection with streptococcal strains of mics > or =0.125 microg/ml to penicillin was associated  with a lower incidence of all-site embolization, but was not associated with higher mortality or increased frequency of surgery. conclusions: high-level penicillin resistance of the streptococci responsible for endocarditis was increasingly common and medical therapy with vancomycin had a good response. penicillin resistance was associated with a decreased risk of embolization, but was not associated with higher mortality.

AB  == xylitol is promoted in caries-preventive strategies, yet its effective dose range is unclear. this study determined the dose-response of mutans streptococci in plaque and unstimulated saliva to xylitol gum. participants (n = 132) were randomized: controls (g1) (sorbitol/maltitol), or combinations giving xylitol 3.44 g/day (g2), 6.88 g/day (g3), or 10.32 g/day (g4). groups chewed 3 pellets/4  times/d. samples were taken at baseline, 5 wks, and 6 mos, and were cultured on modified mitis salivarius agar for mutans streptococci and on blood agar for total culturable flora. at 5 wks, mutans streptococci levels in plaque were 10x lower than baseline in g3 and g4 (p = 0.007/0.003). there were no differences in  saliva. at 6 mos, mutans streptococci in plaque for g3 and g4 remained 10x lower  than baseline (p = 0.007/0.04). saliva for g3 and g4 was lower than baseline by 8 to 9x (p = 0.011/0.038). xylitol at 6.44 g/day and 10.32 g/day reduces mutans streptococci in plaque at 5 wks, and in plaque and unstimulated saliva at 6 mos.  a plateau effect is suggested between 6.44 g and 10.32 g xylitol/day.

TI  == influence of biosurfactant on interactive forces between mutans streptococci and  enamel measured by atomic force microscopy.
AB  == although interactive forces, influenced by environmental conditions, between oral bacteria and tooth surfaces are important for the development of plaque, they have never been estimated. it is hypothesized that interactive forces, as measured by atomic force microscopy, between enamel with or without a pellicle and two strains of mutans streptococci become less attractive by the application  of a streptococcus mitis bms biosurfactant coating. upon approach of each of the  strains toward bare and pellicle-coated enamel, adsorbed biosurfactant increased  the range of the repulsive forces. upon retraction of the enamel surface, small adhesion forces (0.8-0.9 nn) were measured for bare enamel that almost disappeared after biosurfactant coating. the prevalence and magnitude of the adhesion forces also decreased upon pellicle-coating of the enamel, with a minor  effect of adsorbed biosurfactant. these findings indicate that adsorbed s. mitis  bms biosurfactant changes the interactive forces between the mutans streptococci  studied and enamel, explaining the effects of biosurfactant on adhesion.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial effects of mastic chewing gum against streptococcus mutans and mutans streptococci.
AB  == background and objective: dental caries is associated with oral pathogens and streptococcus mutans (s. mutans) is one of the primary cariogenic organisms. mastic gum, from pistacia lentiscus, has been shown to have antibacterial properties. the objective of this study was to determine antibacterial activity of mastic chewing gum against s. mutans and mutans streptococci in vitro and in vivo conditions. setting: cukurova university, dental school, in 2002. materials  and methods: antimicrobial activity of mastic gum was evaluated using standard s. mutans strain by disc diffusion method in vitro. cytotoxicity effect of mastic gum on hep-2 cells was evaluated by conventional haemocytometer using the trypan  blue exclusion method. clinical studies were then performed on 25 periodontally healthy volunteers. the inhibitory effect of chewing mastic gum against mutans streptococci in saliva was compared to a placebo gum. saliva samples were taken from the subjects immediately before and after chewing the mastic gum and the placebo gum for 15 min. additional saliva samples were collected every 30 min. the samples were inoculated onto mitis salivarius-bacitracin agar and incubated for 48 h anaerobically at 37 degrees c. the total number of viable bacteria was then counted. results: among tested solvents (chloroform, acetone, petrolium ether and ethanol), it was found that the acetone was found to be more convenient than the others to dissolve the mastic gum. in the cytotoxicity assay, concentrations up to 75 mg/ml of the mastic gum were not toxic for the replication of hep-2 cells. thus, lower concentrations of mastic gum (20 and 50 mg/ml) were used for the experiments. in vitro experiments, the diameters of growth inhibition zones of mastic gum were in the range 9.0-27.0 mm. in the clinical trials, the mean number of bacteria in samples taken after chewing the mastic gum and placebo gum were following; at minute 15 was 112 x 10(4)+/-268 x 10(3) and 175 x 10(4)+/-417 x 10(3)cfu/ml, for minute 45 was 85 x 10(4)+/-219 x 10(3) and 165 x 10(4)+/-329 x 10(3)cfu/ml, at minute 75 was 65 x 10(4)+/-100 x 10(3) and 160 x 10(4)+/-216 x 10(3)cfu/ml, at minute 105 was 60 x 10(4)+/-127 x 10(3) and 150 x 10(4)+/-138 x 10(3)cfu/ml, and at minute 135 was 55 x 10(4)+/-65  x 10(3) and 145 x 10(4)+/-354 x 10(3)cfu/ml, respectively. significantly fewer bacteria was found in saliva samples collected after chewing mastic gum compared  to those after chewing paraffin (p<0.001). conclusions: this preliminary study showed that mastic gum had significant antibacterial activity against s. mutans and mutans streptococci and it may be a useful adjunct in the prevention of caries.

AB  == the aim of this study was to use molecular identification methods, such as 16s rna gene sequence and reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization, for identification of the bacteria associated with dental caries and with dental health in a subset of 204 twins aged 1.5 to 7 years old. a total of 448 plaque samples (118 collected from caries-free subjects and 330 from caries-active subjects) were used for analysis. we compared the bacteria found in biofilms of children exhibiting severe dental caries, with different degrees of lesion severity, with those found in biofilms of caries-free children. a panel of 82 bacterial species was selected, and a pcr-based reverse-capture checkerboard method was used for detection. a simple univariate test was used to determine the overabundance and underabundance of bacterial species in the diseased and in the  healthy groups. features identified with this univariate test were used to construct a probabilistic disease prediction model. furthermore, a method for the analysis of global patterns of gene expression was performed to permit simultaneous analysis of the abundance of significant species by allowing cross-bacterial comparisons of abundance profiles between caries-active and caries-free subjects. our results suggested that global patterns of microbial abundance in this population are very distinctive. the top bacterial species found to be overabundant in the caries-active group were actinomyces sp. strain b19sc, streptococcus mutans, and lactobacillus spp., which exhibited an inverse relationship to beneficial bacterial species, such as streptococcus parasanguinis, abiotrophia defectiva, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis,  and streptococcus sanguinis.

TI  == in vitro activity of daptomycin against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == we determined the activity of daptomycin, a recently fda-approved antimicrobial agent, against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria, including viridans group streptococci (16 streptococcus mitis species group, 12 s. mutans species group, 9 s. anginosus species group, 8 s. sanguinis species group, 5 s. salivarius species group) from patients with infective endocarditis, 32 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 32 high-level penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, 38 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (including 1 linezolid-resistant isolate), and the following unusual gram-positive bacteria: 3 listeria monocytogenes, 4 erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, 9 corynebacterium species, 10 abiotrophia/granulicatella species, 2 rothia (stomatococcus) mucilaginosus, and 4 gemella morbillorum. daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)(90) values for the viridans group streptococci, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, and enterococcus species were 0.5, 0.5, < or =0.125, and 4 microg/ml, respectively. the daptomycin mic range for the unusual gram-positive bacteria was < or =0.125-2 microg/ml. we conclude that daptomycin has in vitro activity against viridans group streptococci associated with endocarditis as well as against several types  of unusual gram-positive bacteria that can cause endocarditis.

TI  == characterization of salivary immunoglobulin a responses in children heavily exposed to the oral bacterium streptococcus mutans: influence of specific antigen recognition in infection.
AB  == the initial infection of children by streptococcus mutans, the main pathogen of dental caries, depends on the ability of s. mutans to adhere and accumulate on tooth surfaces. these processes involve the adhesin antigen i/ii (agi/ii), glucosyltransferases (gtf) and glucan-binding protein b (gbpb), each a target for anticaries vaccines. the salivary immunoglobulin a (iga) antibody responses to s. mutans antigens (ags) were characterized in 21 pairs of 5- to 13-month-old children. pairs were constructed with one early s. mutans-infected and one noninfected child matched by age, racial background, number of teeth, and salivary levels of iga. specific salivary iga antibody response and s. mutans infection levels were then measured during a 1-year follow-up. robust responses to s. mutans were detected from 6 months of age. salivary iga antibody to agi/ii  and gtf was commonly detected in salivas of all 42 children. however, gbpb-specific iga antibody was seldom detected in the subset of infected children (38.1% at baseline). in contrast, most of the subset of noninfected children (76.2%) showed gbpb-reactive iga antibody during the same period. frequencies of  gbpb responses increased with age, but differences in intensities of gbpb-iga antibody reactions were sustained between the subsets. at baseline, gbpb-reactive iga antibody accounted for at least half of the total salivary iga s. mutans-reactive antibody in 33.3 and 9.5% of noninfected and infected children, respectively. this study provides evidence that a robust natural response to s. mutans ags can be achieved by 1 year of age and that iga antibody specificities may be critical in modulating initial s. mutans infection.

TI  == differentiation of mutans streptococci by intact cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == it is difficult to distinguish mutans streptococci on the species level, and even more so on the subspecies level. intact cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) (icm) was applied to reference strains of five of the species of the mutans group (streptococcus criceti, streptococcus downei, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus ratti, streptococcus sobrinus), nonmutans streptococci (streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis), and  177 mutans streptococci isolated from saliva of 10 children. from the analysis of the reference strains, readily distinguishable icm mass spectra were obtained for the different species. based on multivariate statistical analysis, a correct and  unambiguous assignment was made of the spectra of 159 isolated mutans streptococci to s. mutans and 16 isolates to s. sobrinus. two isolates were sorted out and were identified by sequencing of their 16s rrna genes as streptococcus anginosus. in addition, icm indicated a misclassification for some  reference strains (aht, v 100 and e 49) and re-classified aht and e 49 as s. ratti and v 100 as s. sobrinus. this was confirmed by 16s rdna sequencing. based  on a statistical similarity analysis of the spectra of reference strains and a quantitative assessment of the reproducibility of icm, the isolates identified as either s. mutans or s. sobrinus were phenotyped on the subspecies level. in the population of the clinical isolates, 14 unambiguously different s. mutans and three different s. sobrinus phenotypes were detected. icm proved to be a powerful tool for a differentiation of mutans streptococci down to the subspecies level.

TI  == susceptibilities of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to antibacterial peptides, {beta}-defensins and ll37, produced by human epithelial cells.
AB  == objectives: antimicrobial peptides are one of the factors involved in innate immunity. the susceptibility of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to the major antimicrobial peptides produced by epithelia was investigated. methods: synthetic antimicrobial peptides of human beta-defensin-1 (hbd1), hbd2, hbd3 and  ll37 (cap18) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against oral bacteria. they included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (20 strains), porphyromonas gingivalis (6), prevotella intermedia (7), fusobacterium nucleatum  (7), streptococcus mutans (5), streptococcus sobrinus (5), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus sanguis (4), streptococcus mitis (2) and lactobacillus casei (1). results: although the four peptides had bactericidal activity against all bacteria tested, the degree of antibacterial activity was variable against the different strains and species. the antibacterial activity of hbd1 was lower than that of the other peptides. among the bacteria tested in this study, f. nucleatum was highly susceptible to hbd3 and ll37, and s. mutans was highly susceptible to hbd3. we measured the zeta-potential, representing the net  charge of whole bacteria, to study the relationship between susceptibility to cationic peptide and the net charge of the bacteria. although we found some correlation in a. actinomycetemcomitans strains, we did not find a definite correlation with all the bacterial species. conclusions: these results indicate that beta-defensins and ll37 have versatile antibacterial activity against oral bacteria.

TI  == identification of non-mutans streptococci organisms in dental plaques recovering  on mitis-salivarius bacitracin agar medium.
AB  == the objective of this study was to both isolate and identify non-mutans streptococci organisms (non-mso) from dental plaques recovered on mitis-salivarius sucrose bacitracin agar (msb) plates. the dental plaque samples, which had been collected from 63 human subjects, were diluted and plated on msb.  the bacteria growing on the msb plates were then identified with biochemical tests, as well as with 16s rdna cloning and sequencing techniques. our data indicated that bacteria from 30 subjects had been recovered on the msb plates. among the 21 typical colonies selected from the 30 subjects, 12 colonies, derived from 10 subjects, were identified as non-mso. these 12 colonies were determined to be streptococcus anginosus (8 colonies), s. sanguinis (1 colony), and pantoea  agglomerans (3 colonies). these results strongly suggest that a new selective medium will be required for the reliable isolation of mutans streptococci.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic selection of microbiota surviving under dental restorations.
AB  == the effects of sealing infected carious dentine below dental restorations on the  phenotypic and genotypic diversity of the surviving microbiota was investigated.  it was hypothesized that the microbiota would be subject to nutrient limitation or nutrient simplification, as it would no longer have access to dietary components or salivary secretion for growth. the available nutrients would be limited primarily to serum proteins passing from the pulp through the patent dentinal tubules to the infected dentine. ten lesions were treated, and infected  dentine was sealed below dental restorations for approximately 5 months. duplicate standardized samples of infected dentine were taken at baseline and after the removal of the restorations. the baseline microbiota were composed primarily of lactobacillus spp., streptococcus mutans, streptococcus parasanguinis, actinomyces israelii, and actinomyces gerencseriae. none of these  taxa were isolated among the microbiota of the dentine samples taken after 5 months, which consisted of only actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus intermedius, and streptococcus mitis. the microbiota of the final sample exhibited a significantly (p < 0.001) increased ability to produce glycosidic enzymes (sialidase, beta-n-acetylglucosaminidase, and beta-galactosidase), which liberate sugars from glycoproteins. the genotypic diversity of s. oralis and a. naeslundii was significantly (p = 0.002 and p = 0.001, respectively) reduced in the final samples. there was significantly (p < 0.001) greater genotypic diversity within these taxa between the pairs of dentine samples taken at baseline than was found in the 5-month samples, indicating that  the dentine was more homogenous than it was at baseline. we propose that during the interval between placement of the restorations and their removal, the available nutrient, primarily serum proteins, or the relative simplicity and homogeneity of the nutrient supply significantly affected the surviving microbiota. the surviving microbiota was less complex, based on compositional, phenotypic, and genotypic analyses, than that isolated from carious lesions which were also exposed to salivary secretions and ph perturbations.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by an oligonucleotide array.
AB  == viridans streptococci (vs) are common etiologic agents of subacute infective endocarditis and are capable of causing a variety of pyogenic infections. many species of vs are difficult to differentiate by phenotypic traits. an oligonucleotide array based on 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic spacer (its) sequences was developed to identify 11 clinically relevant vs. these 11 species were streptococcus anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, and s. uberis. the method consisted of pcr amplification of the its regions by using  a pair of universal primers, followed by hybridization of the digoxigenin-labeled pcr products to a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides immobilized on a nylon membrane. after 120 strains of the 11 species of vg and 91 strains of other bacteria were tested, the sensitivity and specificity of the oligonucleotide array were found to be 100% (120 of 120 strains) and 95.6% (87 of 91 strains), respectively. s. pneumoniae cross-hybridized to the probes used for the identification of s. mitis, and simple biochemical tests such as optochin susceptibility or bile solubility should be used to differentiate s. pneumoniae from s. mitis. in conclusion, identification of species of vs by use of the present oligonucleotide array is accurate and could be used as an alternative reliable method for species identification of strains of vs.

AB  == the influence of streptococcus mitis bms biosurfactants on the adhesion of eight  pioneer and four cariogenic oral bacterial strains was, for a first screening, examined in a microtiter plate assay. the adhesion to pellicle-coated wells of three cariogenic strains was inhibited >70% by the biosurfactants, while only one pioneer strain showed >70% reduction. the reduction for the other strains did not exceed 50%. subsequently, adhesion of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 and streptococcus sobrinus hg 1025, both cariogenic strains, and actinomyces naeslundii t14v-j1 and streptococcus oralis j22, two pioneer strains, to biosurfactants-coated enamel with and without a salivary pellicle was studied in  a parallel plate flow chamber. a biosurfactants coating to enamel with or without a pellicle caused a reduction in the number of adhering cariogenic organisms, although no such reduction was observed for the pioneer strains. consequently, it is concluded that s. mitis bms biosurfactants may play a protective role against  adhesion of cariogenic bacteria.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effect of antibacterial self-etching primer on mutans streptococci obtained from arrested carious lesions.
AB  == background: an antibacterial self-etching primer has been developed to inhibit bacterial attachment and plaque accumulation on the tooth surfaces. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the growth-inhibitory effect of an antibacterial self-etching primer on mutans streptococci obtained from arrested carious lesions. materials and methods: softened dentin specimens were obtained from arrested carious lesions with an excavator or a round steel bur. the effect of a  commercial antibacterial self-etching primer and a commercial self-etching primer on the total streptococci on mitis-salivarius (ms) agar plates and on streptococcus mutans on ms agar plates containing 0.02 m bacitracin (msb) was evaluated. specimens with no primer were used as controls. the number of colonies of both total streptococci and s. mutans were compared statistically with two-way analysis of variance and fisher's protected least squares differences (plsd) test (p < .05). results: the number of colonies of total streptococci (cfu/ml) for the two methods (excavator and round steel bur) were as follows: for the control, 5.0 x 10(6) and 5.0 x 10(6); for the self-etching primer, 1.0 x 10(5) and 1.0 x 10(5); and for the antibacterial self-etching primer, 0 and 0. the number of colonies of s. mutans for the two methods (excavator and round steel bur) were as follows: for the control, 5.0 x 10(6) and 1.8 x 10(5); for the self-etching primer, 3.5 x 10(4) and 5.0 x 10(3); and for the antibacterial self-etching primer, 0 and 0. regardless of the method of softened dentin removal, the antibacterial effect was significantly higher for the group that had antibacterial self-etching primer compared with that of the control group and the group that had commercial self-etching primer (p < .05). clinical significance: the antibacterial self-etching primer showed a high level of antibacterial activity against mutans streptococci obtained from the arrested carious lesions.

TI  == effect of hydrophobicity on in vitro streptococcal adhesion to dental alloys.
AB  == non-specific interactions such as electrostatic interactions, and surface free energy are of importance in bacterial adhesion to dental surfaces as they determine whether or not bacteria are attracted to the surface. the relationship  between adherence of streptococcus mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis and s. sanguinis on precious and non-precious dental alloys, and the bacterial and alloy surface hydrophobicities (a measure of the surface free energy) was studied. the number of adhering bacteria was determined by fluorescence microscopy counts. the hydrophobicity of the bacteria and alloy surfaces were evaluated by adhesion to hexadecane and water contact angles, respectively. our results showed that (i) the surfaces of the tested alloys were hydrophobic, (ii) s. sanguinis, s. mutans  and s. oralis were hydrophobic, and (iii) s. mitis was hydrophilic. s. oralis, the more hydrophobic strain, demonstrated the highest adherence on the tested materials, whereas s. mitis adhered least on the hydrophobic surfaces. for the tested alloys, bacterial adherence was highest for the high gold content alloy, and lowest for the non-precious alloy. our results showed that for the tested bacterial strains, there was a significant correlation between bacterial adhesion and substratum hydrophobicity: hydrophobic metal surfaces favor adhesion of hydrophobic bacteria.

TI  == inhibitory effects of cranberry juice on attachment of oral streptococci and biofilm formation.
AB  == cranberry juice is known to inhibit bacterial adhesion. we examined the inhibitory effect of cranberry juice on the adhesion of oral streptococci strains labeled with [3h]-thymidine to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads (s-ha). when the bacterial cells were momentarily exposed to cranberry juice, their adherence  to s-ha decreased significantly compared with the control (p < 0.01). their hydrophobicity also decreased dependently with the concentration of cranberry juice. we also evaluated the inhibitory effect of cranberry juice on biofilm formation. by using a microplate system, we found that the high molecular mass constituents of cranberry juice inhibited the biofilm formation of the tested streptococci. the inhibitory activity was related to the reduction of the hydrophobicity. the present findings suggest that cranberry juice component(s) can inhibit colonization by oral streptococci to the tooth surface and can thus slow development of dental plaque.

TI  == one of two human lactoferrin variants exhibits increased antibacterial and transcriptional activation activities and is associated with localized juvenile periodontitis.
AB  == the iron-binding protein lactoferrin is a ubiquitous and abundant constituent of  human exocrine secretions. lactoferrin inhibits bacterial growth by sequestering  essential iron and also exhibits non-iron-dependent antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and immunoregulatory activities. all of  these non-iron-dependent activities are mediated by the highly charged n terminus of lactoferrin. in this study we characterized a lys/arg polymorphism at position 29 in the n-terminal region of human lactoferrin that results from a single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 1 of the human lactoferrin gene. we expressed cdnas encoding both lactoferrin variants in insect cells and purified the two proteins by ion exchange chromatography. the two lactoferrin variants exhibited nearly identical iron-binding and iron-releasing activities and equivalent bactericidal activities against a strain of the gram-negative bacterium actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. when tested against the gram-positive species streptococcus mutans and streptococcus mitis, however, lactoferrin containing lys at position 29 exhibited significantly greater bactericidal activity than did lactoferrin containing arg. in addition, the lys-containing lactoferrin stimulated bovine tracheal epithelial cells to synthesize much higher levels of tracheal antimicrobial peptide mrna than did the arg-containing variant. a genotyping assay that distinguished between the two alleles based on a polymorphic eari restriction site showed that the lys and arg alleles had frequencies of 24% and 76%, respectively, among 17 healthy human subjects, and 72% and 28%, respectively, among nine patients with localized juvenile periodontitis. our findings suggest that these two lactoferrin variants are functionally different and that these differences may contribute to the pathogenesis of localized juvenile periodontitis.

AB  == the intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. in addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. the results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well  as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at ph 5.5 and 1% at ph 5.0, ph values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. at ph 5.0, members of the genus streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. the other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordinii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and sstreptococcus sanguis. analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.

TI  == [effects of topical application of immunoglobulin yolk on mutans streptococci in  dental plaque].
AB  == objective: to evaluate the inhibitory effects of topical application of specific  immunoglobulin yolk antibodies (igy) to mutans streptococci on composition of human dental plaque. methods: a total of 24 healthy adult volunteers were selected and randomly distributed into three experimental groups. after a supragingival scaling, the subjects were treated with an application of igy containing spray (test group, n = 9), a 0.15% chlorhexidine(ch) spray(positive control group, n = 9) or a placebo phosphate buffered saline(pbs) spray without any active ingredients(negative control group, n = 6) three times daily for three weeks. pooled plaque samples from the smooth surfaces of teeth were collected for microbiologic analysis before administration (baseline, day 0), during treatment(days 7, 14 and 21) and after withdrawal of the agents(days 28, 42 and 56) and plaque index were recorded. microbial cultivation were performed by serially diluting the samples with pbs solution an cultivating the aliquots on mitis salivarius agar(ms) and ms supplemented with bacitracin (msb) for oral streptococci and mutans streptococci respectively. the number of colony-forming unit (cfu) per plate was counted and the percentage of mutans streptococci per oral streptococci in dental plaque were determined. the effect of igy on colonization of mutans streptococci were analyzed by an analysis of variance (anova). results: the plaque indexes remained unchanged, but mutans streptococci  in dental plaque was suppressed significantly following a short term(three weeks) application of igy, and low level of mutans streptococci persisted for at least 5 weeks after withdrawal of igy. conclusion: the results suggest that the immunization with specific immunoglobulin yolk against mutans streptococci could  be useful for long term suppression of mutans streptococci colonization in human  dental plaque.

TI  == effect of acidic ph on expression of surface-associated proteins of streptococcus oralis.
AB  == streptococcus oralis, a member of the mitis group of oral streptococci, is implicated in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis and is the predominant aciduric non-mutans-group streptococcus in dental plaque. we undertook to identify the most abundant surface-associated proteins of s. oralis and to investigate changes in protein expression when the organism was grown under acidic culture conditions. surface-associated proteins were extracted from cells  grown in batch culture, separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, excised, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption  ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. putative functions were assigned by homology to a translated genomic database of streptococcus pneumoniae. a total of 27 proteins were identified; these included a lipoprotein, a ribosome recycling factor, and the glycolytic enzymes phosphoglycerate kinase, fructose bisphosphate aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and enolase. the most abundant protein, phosphocarrier protein hpr, was present as three isoforms. neither lactate dehydrogenase nor pyruvate oxidase, dominant intracellular proteins, were present among the proteins on the gels, demonstrating that proteins in the surface-associated pool did not arise as a result of cell lysis. eleven of the proteins identified were differentially expressed when cells were grown at ph 5.2 versus ph 7.0, and these included superoxide dismutase, a homologue of dipeptidase v from lactococcus lactis, and the protein translation elongation factors g, tu, and ts. this study has extended the range of streptococcal proteins known to be expressed at the cell surface. further investigations are required to ascertain their functions at this extracellular location and determine how their expression is influenced by other environmental conditions.

TI  == identification of mutans streptococci by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified 16s ribosomal rna genes.
AB  == mutans streptococci are frequently isolated from dental plaque and carious lesions. these bacteria have been identified by conventional methods such as biochemical and serologic tests followed by the isolation of colonies on the mitis-salivarius agar, which are sometimes inconsistent. recently, species-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) has been reported to rapidly identify streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus. however, in the case of identification and classification into several species, e.g. within the group of  mutans streptococci consisting of seven species, the identification using species-specific pcr seems somewhat inefficient because of need for the development and preparation of specific primers for each species. therefore, in this study we developed a simple method using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of pcr-amplified 16s ribosomal rna genes (16s rrna genes pcr-rflp) for the identification of seven different species included in the group of mutans streptococci. we amplified 16s rrna gene sequences from genomic dna samples by pcr using universal primers and digested the pcr products with the restriction endonucleases, hpaii and haeiii. hpaii produced six rflp patterns for eight reference strains, since the patterns for s. sobrinus, streptococcus downei and streptococcus ferus were similar. rflp patterns produced with haeiii could separate these three species. furthermore, the rflp patterns predicted from the 16s rrna gene sequences in the genbank database agreed with the actual rflp patterns produced in the present study. the 16s rrna sequence comparisons can be  used to identify oral mutans streptococci; however, the identification by sequencing is sometimes difficult in large-scale studies and for small laboratories. therefore, 16s rrna genes pcr-rflp, using hpaii and haeiii, could be an alternative method for the identification of mutans streptococci, and may be applicable for large-scale studies on the cariogenicity of mutans streptococci.

TI  == real-time interaction of oral streptococci with human salivary components.
AB  == oral streptococci are present in large numbers in dental plaque and several types interact with the enamel salivary pellicle to form a biofilm on tooth surfaces. the respective affinity of individual streptococci for salivary components has an influence on the etiologic properties of oral biofilm in the development of dental caries. we studied real-time biospecific interactions between oral streptococci and salivary components utilizing biosensor technology to analyze surface plasmon resonance. streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans showed  significant responses for binding to salivary components, in comparison with other bacteria. further, the association rates (4.1 x 10-11/bacterium) and dissociation rate (5.7 +/- 0.9 x 10-3 second(s)-1) were higher for s. sanguis than for s. mutans (2.4 x 10-11 and 2.9 +/- 0.8 x 10-3) and streptococcus mitis (1.3 x 10-11 and 3.5 +/- 1.3 x 10-3). however, the association equilibrium constants (8.2 s/bacterium) for s. mutans was 2 times higher in than s. mitis (3.8) and slightly higher than s. sanguis (7.2). these findings may provide useful information regarding the mechanism of early biofilm formation by streptococci on the tooth surface.

TI  == non-mutans streptococci in patients receiving radiotherapy in the head and neck area.
AB  == objective: to study mutans and non-mutans streptococci in patients after radiotherapy of the head and neck. methods: oral rinse samples collected from nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients before and after radiotherapy were diluted and  cultured on nonselective and selective media for enumeration of total cultivable  plaque flora, mutans and non-mutans streptococci and lactobacilli. non-mutans streptococci were identified biochemically and by 16s rdna sequence homology analysis. results: after irradiation, mutans streptococci were not isolated; the  levels of streptococcus mitis and lactobacilli increased significantly. the level of streptococcus salivarius increased, but the significance was the borderline. the level of streptococcus sanguis decreased significantly after irradiation. the abundance of other oral streptococci species showed no significant changes. conclusions: s. mitis and s. salivarius are the predominant non-mutans streptococci in the high-caries-risk oral flora following radiotherapy.

TI  == evaluation of clinical and microbiological features of deep carious lesions in primary molars.
AB  == purpose: concern about the survival of microorganisms in deep carious lesions may often lead to unnecessary exposure of the pulp during excavation. this study evaluated the relationship between microbiological and clinical results of deep carious lesions in primary molars. methods: clinical evaluation was performed on  72 deep carious lesions considered to have pulp perforation after traditional excavation. the dentin color and consistency were assessed by means of standardized scales using the technique of bjorndal et al before restoration. for microbiological examination, dentin samples were taken by a sterile bur and transferred to transport fluid, then plated on tryptic soy agar for growth of total colony forming units. samples werethen transferred on rogosa sl agar for growth of oral lactobacilli and on mitis salivarius agar for growth of mutans streptococci. results: the proportion of mutans streptococci, lactobacilli, and total colony forming units increased when the dentin color and consistency increased. however, the proportion of lactobacilli was smaller than that of mutans streptococci in carious dentin samples. conclusions: contrary to expectations, the findings showed that the number of bacteria in carious dentin of primary molars was not significantly excessive.

TI  == invasion and killing of human endothelial cells by viridans group streptococci.
AB  == colonization of the cardiovascular endothelium by viridans group streptococci can result in infective endocarditis and possibly atherosclerosis; however, the mechanisms of pathogenesis are poorly understood. we investigated the ability of  selected oral streptococci to infect monolayers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvec) in 50% human plasma and to produce cytotoxicity. planktonic streptococcus gordonii ch1 killed huvec over a 5-h period by peroxidogenesis (alpha-hemolysin) and by acidogenesis but not by production of protein exotoxins. huvec were protected fully by addition of supplemental buffers and bovine liver catalase to the culture medium. streptococci were also found to  invade huvec by an endocytic mechanism that was dependent on polymerization of actin microfilaments and on a functional cytoskeleton, as indicated by inhibition with cytochalasin d and nocodazole. electron microscopy revealed streptococci attached to huvec surfaces via numerous fibrillar structures and bacteria in membrane-encased cytoplasmic vacuoles. following invasion by s. gordonii ch1, huvec monolayers showed 63% cell lysis over 4 h, releasing 64% of the total intracellular bacteria into the culture medium; however, the bacteria did not multiply during this time. the ability to invade huvec was exhibited by selected  strains of s. gordonii, s. sanguis, s. mutans, s. mitis, and s. oralis but only weakly by s. salivarius. comparison of isogenic pairs of s. gordonii revealed a requirement for several surface proteins for maximum host cell invasion: glucosyltransferase, the sialic acid-binding protein hsa, and the hydrophobicity/coaggregation proteins csha and cshb. deletion of genes for the antigen i/ii adhesins, sspa and sspb, did not affect invasion. we hypothesize that peroxidogenesis and invasion of the cardiovascular endothelium by viridans group streptococci are integral events in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis and atherosclerosis.

TI  == correlations between bacterial levels in autologous subgingival plaque and saliva of adult sudanese.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess levels of oral bacteria and their correlations in paired samples of saliva and subgingival plaque in a population of adult sudanese. whole saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples from six probing sites of one tooth in each jaw were obtained from 56 sudanese adults (mean age 35.2+/-8.9 years). levels of 24 oral bacteria in the autologous saliva  and pooled plaque sample of each subject were assessed by dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. there were significantly ( p< or =0.01) higher percentages of subjects with > or =10(5) bacterial cells of prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, veillonella parvula, streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus salivarius, and leptotrichia buccalis and significantly ( p< or =0.01) lower percentages with treponema denticola in saliva than in subgingival plaque. the detection frequencies at > or =10(6) bacterial cells were significantly higher for selenomonas sputigena, s. anginosus, streptococcus sanguis, and s. salivarius and significantly lower for porphyromonas gingivalis in saliva than in subgingival plaque ( p< or =0.01). porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, s. sputigena, s. sanguis, and streptococcus mitis demonstrated significant ( p< or =0.05) positive correlations between their levels in plaque and saliva. this study indicates that the levels of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, s.  sanguis, and s. mitis correlate significantly in saliva and subgingival plaque and that higher accuracy of detection and assessment of the levels of these bacteria in the oral cavity may be achieved by concurrent sampling of saliva and  subgingival plaque.

AB  == background and purpose: cytotoxic t lymphocyte-induced lysis of virus-infected oral epithelial cells has been shown to be a cause of early ulcer formation in recurrent aphthous ulcerations (rau). to test whether bacteria and their associated antigens are involved in the disease process of rau, the proliferative response (pr) to different streptococcal species in peripheral blood mononuclear  cells (pbmc) and t cells isolated from rau patients at the exacerbation stage was determined. methods: pbmc and t cells were isolated from 39 patients with rau, 21 patients with erosive oral lichen plaus (eolp, disease control group), and 22 healthy subjects (normal control group). streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis and their associated antigen, glucosyltransferase d (gtfd), were used to stimulate isolated pbmc and t cells in in vitro proliferation assays. results: pbmc and t cells isolated from rau patients at the exacerbation stage showed a significantly higher pr to s. mutans antigen and gtfd than those isolated from eolp patients or healthy control subjects (p < 0.05). gtfd was a more potent stimulation antigen than s. mutans. however, elevated prs to s. mutans antigen and gtfd were transient and present only in the exacerbation stage of rau. these elevated prs declined to normal levels in the postexacerbation and convalescence stages of rau. furthermore, the gtfd-stimulated pr in pbmc and t cells was correlated with  the severity of rau. conclusion: in addition to viral infections, streptococci and their associated antigen, gtfd, may be involved in the disease process of rau, especially in the exacerbation stage.

TI  == softness of the bacterial cell wall of streptococcus mitis as probed by microelectrophoresis.
AB  == chemical and structural complexity of bacterial cell surfaces complicate accurate quantification of cell surfaces properties. the presence of fibrils, fimbriae or  other surface appendages on bacterial cell surfaces largely influence those properties and would therefore play a major function in interfacial phenomena as  aggregation and adhesion. the electrophoretic softness and fixed charge density in the polyelectrolyte layer of nine streptococcus mitis strains, usually carrying long sparsely distributed fibrils, were determined by the soft particle  analysis using measured electrophoretic mobilities as a function of the ionic strength. in general, s. mitis cell surfaces are electrophoretically soft (1.0-2.5 nm) with a fixed negative charge density of -1.2 to -4.3 x 10(6) cm(-3). further, a comparison with surfaces of other bacterial strains that are reported  to be soft indicates that the ohshima soft layer model does not provide information on the surface morphology causing the softness. the most likely reason is that the electroosmotic flow occurs only in the very outer region of thick extracellular surface layers. nevertheless, determining the surface softness is essential for proper characterization of the cell surface electrostatics.

AB  == background: although a few growth media are available for selective isolation of  the cariogenic bacteria, streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), it is still unclear as to which is the most efficacious. this study compared the selectivity and sensitivity of five different media for growing a laboratory strain of s. mutans  (nctc 10449), and for enumerating s. mutans from teeth of a group of young children, aged 2-10 years. methods: the media tested in this study were mitis salivarius with bacitracin (msb), mitis salivariuskanamycin-bacitracin (mskb), glucose-sucrose-tellurite-bacitracin (gstb), trypticase soy-sucrose-bacitracin (tys20b) and tryptone-yeast-cysteine-sucrose-bacitracin (tycsb) agars. these were prepared according to the respective manufacturer's instructions. results: the results showed that at concentrations of bacteria 1 x 10(3) to 1 x 10(10)/ml, the recovery of the laboratory s. mutans strain was highest in tycsb agar, followed by in descending order by tys20b, msb, gstb, and mskb (p<0.01). similar results were obtained using dental plaque samples collected from swabs of the teeth of a  group of children. in the clinical samples, tycsb again showed the highest recovery rates of s. mutans compared to the other four media. results were reproduced at dilutions of the samples at 1:20 x 10(6) to 1:2 x 10(6), and s. mutans concentrations of 1.6 to 7.7 log 10 cfu/ml. in addition, there were highest ratios of mutans to non-mutans bacteria in tycsb compared to the other media, suggesting high selectivity of this media for mutans species. conclusion:  the results of our study suggest that tycsb is the most sensitive and selective media for culture of s. mutans for laboratory and clinical studies.

TI  == a clinical, microbiologic, and radiographic study of deep caries lesions after incomplete caries removal.
AB  == objective: clinical, radiographic, and microbiologic changes in deep caries lesions were assessed after incomplete carious dentin removal and tooth sealing.  method and materials: thirty-two teeth with deep caries lesions were studied. treatment consisted of incomplete excavation of the demineralized dentin, application of calcium hydroxide, and sealing for a 6- to 7-month period. the color and consistency of the dentin were clinically assessed. differences in radiographic density were assessed by digital image subtraction. microbiologic samples were obtained from the demineralized dentin before the temporary sealing  and after the experimental period. the samples were cultivated on blood agar under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, in mitis salivarius agar, and rogosa selective lactobacillus agar. results: two cases were lost during the study; one  presented pulpal necrosis. in the other case, there was pulpal exposure during removal of provisional sealing. in all teeth, the initial demineralized dentin was soft and wet; one lesion was yellow, 21 were light brown, and eight were dark brown. after treatment, the dentin was dry, and 80.00% of specimens were hard, 16.67% were leathery, and 3.33% remained soft. the dentin was light brown in five teeth and dark brown in 25. there was a statistically significant mean difference in radiographic density (pixel intensity), 88.77 +/- 7.02 in the control areas and 94.66 +/- 6.75 in the test areas. the counts of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria, lactobacilli, and streptococci mutans had decreased significantly by the end of treatment. conclusion: incomplete removal of carious dentin and subsequent tooth sealing resulted in the arrest of the lesions, suggesting that complete dentinal caries lesion removal is not essential to the control of caries lesions.

TI  == a xerd recombinase with unusual active site motifs in streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == xerd belongs to the site specific recombinases of the integrase family of proteins that catalyze recombination events via a phosphotyrosine intermediate. sequence alignments and crystal structure resolution of e. coli xerd and related  enzymes demonstrated the importance of four conserved amino acids r-h-r-h that are spaced along the c-terminal domain in addition to a conserved k and the active site y, all of which have been implicated in catalysis. the deduced amino  acid sequence of the putative s. pneumoniae xerd contained three unique replacements at the conserved positions resulting in l-q-r-l; moreover, the active site y was the penultimate amino acid residue, and the extreme c-terminal  region suggested to be involved in interaction of e. coli xerd with xerc was lacking. severe growth defects in a loss-of-function xerd mutant are consistent with an important in vivo function of the s. pneumoniae xerd protein. highly related xerd genes with similar unusual amino acid replacements were found in s.  mitis, s. mutans and s. pyogenes but not in other gram-positive bacteria, although the genetic environment was very similar in many species. there are at least another four genes in the s. pneumoniae knr_7/87 genome encoding xer related peptides, one of which was identified as the xerc homologue. the xerd and xerc genes were present in a sample of 20 s. pneumoniae strains whereas the other xer genes appear to be absent in some of the strains and are more closely related to integrases of phage and transposon origin.

TI  == vaccination with fima from streptococcus parasanguis protects rats from endocarditis caused by other viridans streptococci.
AB  == the fima protein of streptococcus parasanguis is a virulence factor in the rat model of endocarditis, and immunization with fima protects rats against homologous bacterial challenge. because fima-like proteins are widespread among the oral streptococci, the leading cause of native valve endocarditis, we evaluated the ability of this vaccinogen to protect rats when challenged by other streptococcal species. here we report that fima vaccination produced antibodies that cross-reacted with and protected against challenge by the oral streptococci  s. mitis, s. mutans, and s. salivarius. fima thus has promise as a vaccinogen to  control infective endocarditis caused by oral streptococci.

TI  == [typing of streptococcus mutans (serotype c) by arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction].
AB  == objective: to study the relationship between genetic diversity within streptococcus mutans (c), and dental caries. methods: one reference strain (gs5)  was used to establish the suitability of primers and the initial ap-pcr conditions. isolates of streptococcus mutans (c) were obtained from 19 caries-free and 40 caries-active patients, and were originally isolated on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. totally 278 isolates were biochemically and serologically confirmed as streptococcus mutans (c). chromosomal dna was extracted from those isolates by chelex. one random primer, opa-05 was used as a  template in pcr reaction. all amplification reactions were conducted in a volume  of 20 microliters containing 2 microliters of 10 x reaction buffer, 200 mumol/l each of datp, dctp, dgtp and dttp and 2.5 units of taq dna polymerase. we varied  the concentrations of mgcl2 (1.5-4.5 mmol/l), template dna (2-40 ng), and primer  (0.3-0.5 mumol/l) to determine the optical conditions for ap-pcr. the temperature profile in a thermocycler was 35 cycles as follows: 94 degrees c for 1 min, at 36 degrees c for 2 min, at 72 degrees c for 2 min. the initial denaturation was at 94 degrees c for 5 min and the final extension at 72 degrees c for 5 min. results: the mgcl2 concentration in 4 mmol/l and the primer concentration in 0.5  mumol/l produced clearly distinct and reproducible fingerprints. we found 105 different patterns among the 278 isolates. in high-caries persons more than one genotype isolates of streptococcus mutans (c) were colonized. conclusions: isolates of streptococcus mutans (c) exist apparent genetic diversity. the genotypes of isolates might relate to differences in caries susceptibility.

TI  == retention of oral microorganisms on conventional and resin-modified glass-ionomer cements.
AB  == secondary caries are a worldwide public and socioeconomic problem. the placement  of restorations can lead to the development of environmental conditions favorable to microbial colonization, especially on the tooth/restoration interface, which is a predisposing factor for secondary caries. the aim of this study was to evaluate microbial retention on conventional (chelon-fil and vidrion r) and resin-modified (vitremer and fuji ii lc) glass-ionomer cements, in situ, using a  hybrid composite resin (z100) as a control. twelve volunteers wore hawley appliances with specimens made of all tested filling materials for 7 days. the specimens were then removed from the appliances and transferred to tubes containing 2.0 ml of ringer-pras. microorganisms from the samples were inoculated onto blood agar and mitis salivarius bacitracin agar and incubated under anaerobiosis (90% n2, 10% co2), at 37 degrees c, for 10 and 2 days, respectively. the resin-modified glass-ionomer cements and the composite resin retained the same levels of microorganisms on their surfaces. the resin-modified glass-ionomers retained less mutans streptococci than the composite resin and conventional glass-ionomer cements. the conventional glass-ionomer cements retained less mutans streptococci than the composite resin, but that difference was not statistically significant.

TI  == efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (ii). effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == cariogenic potential of lactosylfructoside as determined by acidogenicity of oral streptococci in vitro and human dental plaque in situ.
AB  == the cariogenic potential of lactosylfructoside [o-beta-d-galactopyranosyl-(1-->4)-o-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl-(1<-->2)-beta-d-fruct ofuranoside] was estimated by experiments on oral streptococci in vitro and human dental plaque in situ. lactosylfructoside was unable to support growth of the strains of streptococcus mutans and s. sobrinus used in this study. however, it was able to support growth of strains of s. sanguis, s. mitis and s. oralis. acid was produced rapidly by cell suspensions of s. oralis atcc 10557 incubated with lactosylfructoside. application of 5% w/v solution decreased the ph of human dental plaque. the minimum ph value was below 5.3. the results suggest that lactosylfructoside is as acidogenic as lactose and could be cariogenic if it is consumed frequently and retained for a long period in the mouth.

TI  == influence of maternal xylitol consumption on mother-child transmission of mutans  streptococci: 6-year follow-up.
AB  == xylitol is effective as a noncariogenic or even cariostatic sugar substitute. habitual xylitol consumption appears to select for mutans streptococci (ms) which shed easily into saliva from plaque. we have earlier shown that habitual xylitol  consumption of mothers was associated with a statistically significant reduction  in the probability of mother-child transmission of ms assessed at 2 years of age. the aim of the present study was to assess the children's ms counts 1 and 4 years after the maternal xylitol consumption had been discontinued. at baseline, during pregnancy, all mothers (n = 195) showed high salivary levels of ms. the mothers were randomly assigned to xylitol, fluoride (f) and chlorhexidine (chx) groups. in the xylitol group, the mothers chewed xylitol-sweetened gum, for 21 months, starting 3 months after delivery. in the two control groups, the mothers received chx or f varnish treatments at 6, 12 and 18 months after delivery. at the 2-year  examination, 169 mother-child pairs participated. at the 3-year and 6-year examinations, there were 159 and 147 children in the study, respectively. for children's ms analyses, visible plaque was collected using toothpicks at the age  of 3 and paraffin-stimulated saliva at the age of 6. the persons involved in the  collection and analysis of the microbiological samples were blinded as to the study design and group. both the plaque and salivary ms were cultured on mitis salivarius agars containing bacitracin. in all groups, the colonization percentages increased during the follow-up. at the 3-year examination, the children's risk of having ms colonization was 2.3-fold in the f group (95% ci 1.3-4.2) compared to the xylitol group. this difference was statistically significant. even at 6 years of age, the salivary ms levels were significantly lower in the xylitol group than in the other groups (anova, p<0.001). in conclusion, the earlier demonstrated, xylitol-associated reduction in the probability of mother-child transmission of ms was still found in the children's  ms counts at the age of 3 and 6 years.

TI  == oral colonization and cariogenicity of streptococcus gordonii in specific pathogen-free tan:spfom(om)br rats consuming starch or sucrose diets.
AB  == the significance of streptococcus gordonii in dental caries is undefined, as is that of other alpha-amylase-binding bacteria (abb) commonly found in the mouth. to clarify the ecological and cariological roles of s. gordonii our specific pathogen-free osborne-mendel rats, tan:spfom(om)br, were fed either diet 2000 (containing 56% confectioner's sugar, most of which is sucrose) or diet 2000cs (containing 56% cornstarch, in lieu of confectioner's sugar) and inoculated with  s. gordonii strains. uninoculated rats were free of both indigenous mutans streptococci (ms) and abb, including s. gordonii, as shown by culture on mitis salivarius and blood agars of swabs and sonicates of dentitions after weanlings had consumed these diets for 26 days. abb were detected by radiochemical assay using [125i]-amylase reactive to alpha-amylase-binding protein characteristic of  the surface of s. gordonii and other abb. no abb were detected (detection limit < 1 colony-forming units in 10(6) colony-forming units). thus the tan:spfom(om)br colony presents a 'clean animal model' for subsequent study. consequently, s. gordonii strains challis or g9b were used to inoculate weanling rat groups consuming either the high-sucrose diet 2000 or the cornstarch diet 2000cs. two additional groups fed each of these diets remained unioculated. recoveries of inoculants were tested 12 and 26 days later by oral swabs and sonication of the molars of one hemimandible of each animal, respectively. uninoculated animals were reconfirmed to be free of abb and mutans streptococci, but inoculated ones eating diet 2000cs had s. gordonii recoveries of 1-10% or, if eating diet 2000, 10-30% of total colony-farming units in sonicates. there were no statistically significant differences among the inoculated and uninoculated animal groups' caries scores when they ate the cornstarch diet. lesion scores for sucrose-eating rats were, however, from 2.4-5.1-fold higher than for cornstarch-eating rats, p < 0.001, and were still higher if animals had been inoculated with either challis (1.41-fold) or g9b (1.64-fold), than if uninoculated, both p < 0.001, so long as  the rats ate the sucrose diet. therefore, tan:spfom(om)br rats do not harbour abb or s. gordonii but can be colonized by s. gordonii. colonization levels of s. gordonii on the teeth are higher in the presence of high sucrose than with high starch-containing diets. caries scores are augmented by sucrose compared with starch, and are further augmented by s gordonii colonization. s. gordonii is thus cariologically significant in the presence of sucrose, at least in this rat.

TI  == binding of oral streptococci to human fibrinogen.
AB  == the interaction of oral streptococci with human fibrinogen was investigated. streptococcus gordonii was chosen as a representative species to study the binding to fibrinogen. s. gordonii dl1 adhered to immobilized fibrinogen and bovine serum albumin. binding to immobilized fibrinogen was saturable, concentration and temperature dependent. the binding of s. gordonii dl1 to fibrinogen was inhibited by anti-fibrinogen antibody. heating of the bacteria for 1 h at 95 degrees c resulted in 90% inhibition of the binding. trypsin treatment  of the bacteria resulted in decreased binding. neither lipoteichoic acid nor culturing of the bacteria in a sucrose-supplemented medium had any effect on the  binding. s. gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus oralis bound to the immobilized fibrinogen, but mutans streptococci did not. none of the oral streptococci tested bound to the fibrinogen in fluid phase. these results suggest that the binding of s. gordonii dl1 to immobilized fibrinogen is mediated through a specific protein adhesin-receptor interaction, and fibrinogen acts as a cryptitope.

TI  == mannosidase production by viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the production of mannosidase activity by all currently recognized species of human viridans group streptococci was determined using an assay in which bacterial growth was dependent on the degradation of the high-mannose-type glycans of rnase b and subsequent utilization of released mannose. rnase b is an  excellent substrate for the demonstration of mannosidase activity since it is a glycoprotein with a single glycosylation site which is occupied by high-mannose-type glycoforms containing five to nine mannose residues. mannosidase activity was produced only by some members of the mitis group (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus parasanguinis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) and streptococcus intermedius of the anginosus group. none of the other species within the salivarius and mutans groups or streptococcus peroris and streptococcus sanguinis produced mannosidase activity. using matrix-assisted  laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, it was demonstrated that the man(5) glycan alone was degraded while man(6) to man(9), which contain terminal alpha(1-->2) mannose residues in addition to the alpha(1-->3), alpha(1-->6), and beta(1-->4) residues present in man(5), remained intact. investigations on mannosidase production using synthetic (4-methylumbelliferone-  or p-nitrophenol-linked) alpha- or beta-mannosides as substrates indicated that there was no correlation between degradation of these substrates and degradation  of the man(5) glycan of rnase b. no species degraded these alpha-linked mannosides, while degradation of the beta-linked synthetic substrates was restricted to strains within the streptococcus anginosus, s. gordonii, and s. intermedius species. the data generated using a native glycoprotein as the substrate demonstrate that mannosidase production within the viridans group streptococci is more widely distributed than had previously been considered.

TI  == utilization and acid production of beta-galactosyllactose by oral streptococci and human dental plaque.
AB  == beta-galactosyllactose is a trisaccharide containing the beta-galactosidic linkage at the nonreducing end. the purpose of this study was to determine whether certain oral streptococci could utilize four kinds of beta-galactosyllactoses. three of four beta-galactosyllactoses were unable to support growth of the oral streptococci and to be a substrate for producing acid  from the cell suspensions and dental plaque. 4'-beta-galactosyllactose supported  growth of streptococcus sanguis atcc 35105, atcc 49298, streptococcus mitis atcc  15914, streptococcus oralis atcc 35037, atcc 10557 and streptococcus milleri 10707 and produced acid from dental plaque. although beta-galactosidase activities were observed in all the strains, 4'-beta-galactosyllactose could not  be used as a carbon source for the growth of mutans streptococci. enzymes metabolizing 4'-beta-galactosyllactose were induced when s. oralis atcc 10557 was cultured in medium containing galactose. these results suggested that 4'-beta-galactosyllactose could be as cariogenic as lactose if it is consumed frequently and retained for a long period in the mouth.

AB  == our aim was to develop a rapid fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) assay for the identification of different oral groups of streptococci in dental plaque and  to combine it with digital image analysis for the automated enumeration of target cells. cy3-labeled oligonucleotide probes specific for 16s rrna gene sequences of the anginosus, mitis, mutans, and salivarius groups of streptococci were hybridized under stringent conditions with bacterial cultures or supragingival plaque samples that had been permeabilized with lysozyme. probe specificity was determined with strains from 30 different species, mainly of oral origin. results showed that probes ang541, mit447, ssp001, and sal090 with specificity for the anginosus, mitis, mutans, and salivarius groups, respectively, the pan-reactive streptococcal probe str405, the s. mutans specific probe mut590, and the s. sobrinus specific probe sob174 were well-suited for the identification of cultured streptococci. probes str405, mit447 and ssp001 were then successfully applied to enumerate automatically bacteria of the recognized taxa in 144 supragingival plaque samples. on the average, total streptococci accounted for 8.2%, streptococci of the mitis and mutans groups for 3.9 and 1.7%, respectively, of the plaques. the combined application of fish and automated image analysis provides an objective time-saving alternative to culture or pcr for the enumeration of selected oral streptococci in dental plaque.

AB  == this study attempted to determine which combination of plaque or saliva, and tryptic soy agar, bacitracin (tsy20b) or mitis salivarius, bacitracin media, yielded the highest caries-predictive values for mutans counts in children with different caries prevalence. sixty children were divided into three equally sized groups: caries free, low caries and high caries. eighteen months later, their caries incidence and initial mutans count were compared. fissure plaque on tsy20b yielded a high correlation between mutans counts and caries prevalence (p<0.009,  r=3346) and incidence (p<0.003, r=4521). the caries-predictive values obtained demonstrate that the coefficient of variation of mutans counts from lower first-molar fissure plaque on tsy20b accounts for 20.4% of the variation in final caries index. this strong correlation provides a valuable tool for the identification of caries-prone individuals.

TI  == strain-related acid production by oral streptococci.
AB  == acid production, in particular at low ph, is thought to be an important ecological determinant in dental caries. the aim of the present study was to determine the acid producing capability at different ph levels of 47 streptococcal strains, representing 9 species, isolated from human dental plaque. the bacteria were grown until mid log-phase under anaerobic conditions and acid production was measured in a ph-stat system at ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5 and 5.0. at all ph values, the mean velocity of acid production (v(ap)) by streptococcus mutans and s. sobrinus was significantly higher (p<0.01; anova) than that of the other oral streptococci, including s. mitis, s. oralis, s. gordonii, s. sanguis, s. intermedius, s. anginosus, s. constellatus, and s. vestibularis. however, the v(ap) of some strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and s. oralis, particularly at ph values of 7.0 and 6.0, exceeded that of some strains of s. mutans. the v(ap) decreased with ph for all strains, but some strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and strains of the mutans streptococci maintained a relatively high rate of acid production. the results suggest that some strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and s. oralis may play an important role in caries development by modifying the environment in dental plaque to become favourable for the succession of aciduric  species. the study furthermore emphasises the need for detailed species and biovar identification of oral streptococci and for recognition of the significant physiological differences that occur within single species.

AB  == a chemostat mixed culture system was used to produce two distinct ecological states, state-1 (caries-like microcosm) and state-2 (periodontal-like microcosm). eleven bacterial species (streptococcus gordonii, strep. mitis i, strep. mutans,  strep. oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, neisseria subflava, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, veillonella dispar) were used to inoculate the planktonic system. a flow cell, designed to produce convergent flow with increasing shear stress, was attached to the chemostat system, and the resultant biofilms developed from the state-1 and state-2 microcosms along the shear stress gradient were examined and compared using image analysis and viable counts. the biofilm produced from state-1 showed  a lower shear stress tolerance (0.146 pa) than the state-2 biofilm (0.236 pa). the biofilm compositions did not vary along the gradient of shear stress and were dependent on the initial inoculum conditions. gram-positive species were predominant in the state-1 biofilm, while gram-negative species were predominant  in state-2.

TI  == mutans streptococci prevalence in puerto rican babies with cariogenic feeding behaviors.
AB  == purpose: previous studies have demonstrated that babies are at higher risk for mutans streptococci (ms) colonization if their mothers have dense salivary ms reservoirs relative to babies who have mothers with negligible salivary reservoirs. this communication provides data that identifies another potential risk factor (use of a nursing bottle at bedtime and/or naptime that contains a substrate other than water) for baby infection by ms. methods: the study population consisted of 60 babies (28 males/32 females; mean age 15 mos; age range 12-18 mos) who were all healthy, caries free, and slept with a nursing bottle that contained a substrate other than water (nb+). pooled maxillary incisor plaque and saliva samples were obtained and immediately placed in reduced transparent fluid (rtf); they were serially diluted and plated onto mitis salivarius agar plus bacitracin (msb) and blood agar plates within 4 hours of collection; the plates were incubated in an anaerobic environment for 48 h at 37  c and then placed for 24 h under aerobiosis prior to examination; representative  ms colonies were isolated and subjected to mannitol and sorbitol fermentation tests for taxonomic verification. plates with colony counts between 20 and 300 were utilized to determine the % of ms in each sample. results: fifty one of the  60(85%) babies harbored ms in at least 1 of the 2 samples. the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of subjects with detectable levels of ms was 73%-93%. fisher's exact test showed that babies 16-18 mos age were more likely to have detectable levels of ms than babies 12-15 mos age (p = 0.01). levels of ms in plaque and saliva were as follows: < 0.1% (plaque 27/51, mean age 15 mos, sd 1.77; saliva 28/51, mean age 15 mos, sd 1.76); 0.1%-1.0% (plaque 4/51, mean age 14 mos, sd 1.5; saliva 6/51, mean age 15 mos, sd 1.46); > 1.0% (plaque 14/51, mean age 16 mos, sd 2.1; saliva 11/51, mean age 16 mos, sd 1.91). the density of  infection did not vary by age for plaque (p = 0.32) or saliva (p = 0.64). conclusion: these findings support the concept that nb+ is a strong indicator for ms infection in puerto rican babies; that prevalence of infection increases with  age; and that density of infection does not vary with age in this population.

TI  == genotypic heterogeneity of streptococcus oralis and distinct aciduric subpopulations in human dental plaque.
AB  == the genotypic heterogeneity of streptococcus oralis isolated from the oral cavity was investigated using repetitive extragenic palindromic pcr. unrelated subjects  harbored unique genotypes, with numerous genotypes being isolated from an individual. s. oralis is the predominant aciduric bacterium isolated from noncarious tooth sites. genotypic comparison of the aciduric populations isolated at ph 5.2 with those isolated from mitis-salivarius agar (msa) (ph 7.0) indicated that the aciduric populations were genotypically distinct in the majority of subjects (chi(2) = 13.09; p = 0.0031). neither the aciduric nor the msa-isolated  strains were stable, with no strains isolated at baseline being isolated 4 or 12  weeks later in the majority of subjects. the basis of this instability is unknown but is similar to that reported for streptococcus mitis. examination of s. oralis strains isolated from cohabiting couples demonstrated that in three of five couples, genotypically identical strains were isolated from both partners and this was confirmed by using salmonella enteritidis repetitive element pcr and enterobacterial pcr typing. these data provide further evidence of the physiological and genotypic heterogeneity of non-mutans streptococci. the demonstration of distinct aciduric populations of s. oralis implies that the role of these and other non-mutans streptococci in the caries process requires reevaluation.

TI  == the effect of nicotine on growth of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == there is little information available concerning the effects of nicotine on oral  bacteria; and in particular, streptococcus mutans, an important microbe in the etiology of dental caries. to test the effects of nicotine, streptococcus mutans  were incubated in either 0 or 10(-1)-10(-7) m concentrations of nicotine and then plated onto mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. colonies were counted and treatment groups compared. both 10(-1) and 10(-2) m nicotine caused total inhibition of bacterial growth, while 10(-3) and 10(-4) m produced significantly more colonies  than control. also, 10(-6) and 10(-7) m nicotine produced a significant reduction in the mean number of colonies. these results suggest a biphasic, dosage-dependent effect of nicotine on the growth of streptococcus mutans. since  10(-3) m nicotine has been reported within the saliva of smokeless tobacco users, use of these products could stimulate growth of streptococcus mutans and possibly place the user at increased risk for dental caries.

TI  == influence of maternal xylitol consumption on acquisition of mutans streptococci by infants.
AB  == xylitol is effective as a non-cariogenic sugar substitute. habitual xylitol consumption appears to select for mutans streptococci (ms) with impaired adhesion properties, i.e., they shed easily to saliva from plaque. one hundred sixty-nine  mother-child pairs participated in a two-year study exploring whether the mothers' xylitol consumption could be used to prevent mother-child transmission of mutans streptococci. all mothers showed high salivary levels of mutans streptococci during pregnancy. the mothers in the xylitol group (n = 106) were requested to chew xylitol-sweetened gum (65% w/w) at least 2 or 3 times a day, starting three months after delivery. in the two control groups, the mothers received either chlorhexidine (n = 30) or fluoride (n = 33) varnish treatments at 6, 12, and 18 months after delivery. the children did not chew gum or receive varnish treatments. ms were assessed from the mothers' saliva at half-year intervals and from the children's plaque at the one- and two-year examinations. the ms were cultured on mitis salivarius agars containing bacitracin. the salivary ms levels of the mothers remained high and not significantly different among the three study groups throughout the study. at two years of age, 9.7% of the children in the xylitol, 28.6% in the chlorhexidine, and 48.5% in the fluoride varnish group showed a detectable level of ms. in conclusion, therefore, habitual xylitol consumption by mothers was associated with a statistically significant reduction of the probability of mother-child transmission of ms assessed at two years of age. the effect was superior to that obtained with either chlorhexidine or fluoride varnish treatments performed as single applications at six-month intervals.

TI  == effect of an essential oil-containing antiseptic mouthrinse on plaque and salivary streptococcus mutans levels.
AB  == background: clinical studies in which antimicrobial mouthrinses were shown to have significant antiplaque activity most frequently have used gingivitis as the  clinically relevant endpoint. however, there is evidence to suggest that mouthrinses containing active agents effective against streptococcus mutans, such as chlorhexidine, may also have a role in inhibiting dental caries. this clinical study was conducted to determine the effect of 2x-daily rinsing with an essential oil-containing antiseptic mouthrinse (listerine antiseptic) on levels of recoverable s. mutans and total streptococci in supragingival interproximal plaque and in saliva. additionally, a follow-up in vitro study is reported which  determined whether a differential susceptibility to the antiseptic mouthrinse exists among different strains of streptococci. method: following baseline saliva and plaque sampling for quantification of recoverable s. mutans and total streptococci, 29 qualifying subjects were randomly assigned either the essential  oil mouthrinse or a sterile water control. they rinsed with 20 ml for 30s 2 x daily for 11 days and once on the 12th day, in addition to their usual oral hygiene procedures. on day 12, saliva and plaque samples were again collected and microbiological quantification performed. the procedures were repeated with the alternate rinse after a 1-week washout period. results: the essential oil mouthrinse produced respective reductions of 69.9% and 75.4% in total recoverable streptococci and in s. mutans in plaque, and corresponding reductions of 50.8% and 39.2% in saliva. the in vitro study revealed that streptococci from the mutans group were more susceptible to the bactericidal activity of the essential  oil mouthrinse than streptococci from the mitis group. conclusions: as antimicrobial mouthrinses are most frequently recommended to patients whose mechanical oral hygiene procedures are not adequate for the control of supragingival plaque and gingivitis, this study provides an additional rationale  for the inclusion of the essential-oil mouthrinse as an adjunct to daily oral hygiene procedures.

TI  == relationship among mutans streptococci, "low-ph" bacteria, and lodophilic polysaccharide-producing bacteria in dental plaque and early enamel caries in humans.
AB  == multiple interactions occur among major determinants of dental caries. we have studied the bacterial flora and ph-lowering capacity of the same dental plaques in relation to caries. the findings on the plaque flora are reported here. the buccal surfaces of upper teeth in each subject were selected for study. a low-caries group had no "white spot" caries (ws) in the selected dentition area;  a higher-caries group averaged 4.1 ws in this area. the latter group was divided  into subjects with 2, 3, or 4 ws and subjects with 5, 6, or 7 ws. enumerated organisms in plaque samples (sound and ws sites) from all subjects were: (1) mutans streptococci (ms) on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin and mitis-salivarius agar; (2) non-mutans streptococci (non-ms) on mitis-salivarius agar; (3) organisms that were categorized according to their minimum ph in sugar broth, i.e., the predominant undifferentiated total flora on blood agar or the predominant non-ms flora on mitis-salivarius agar; and (4) iodophilic polysaccharide-storing organisms on trypticase-yeast extract-salts agar. plaques  covering ws lesions contained generally only low proportions (< 0.1%) of ms. the  plaque proportions of all the above 4 bacterial groups were increased in the higher-caries group but were similar for s and ws sites in this group. over half  of the total plaque flora in subjects with 5, 6, or 7 ws consisted of "low-ph"-type organisms (minimum ph < 4.4). many of these were neither ms nor "low-ph" non-ms. the numerical emergence of ms in plaque appeared to be preceded  often by other types of "low-ph" bacteria, including the non-ms. caries development in the absence or presence of ms as well as different bacterial successions in plaque can be explained readily by the dynamic and positive relationship among the factors carbohydrate consumption, plaque flora composition, plaque acidogenic potential, and caries activity.

TI  == inhibition of streptococcus mutans ns adhesion to glass with and without a salivary conditioning film by biosurfactant- releasing streptococcus mitis strains.
AB  == the release of biosurfactants by adhering microorganisms as a defense mechanism against other colonizing strains on the same substratum surface has been described previously for probiotic bacteria in the urogenital tract, the intestines, and the oropharynx but not for microorganisms in the oral cavity. two streptococcus mitis strains (ba and bms) released maximal amounts of biosurfactants when they were grown in the presence of sucrose and were harvested in the early stationary phase. the s. mitis biosurfactants reduced the surface tensions of aqueous solutions to about 30 to 40 mj m(-2). biochemical and physicochemical analyses revealed that the biosurfactants released were glycolipids. an acid-precipitated fraction was extremely surfactive and was identified as a rhamnolipidlike compound. in a parallel-plate flow chamber, the number of streptococcus mutans ns cells adhering to glass with and without a salivary conditioning film in the presence of biosurfactant-releasing s. mitis ba and bms (surface coverage, 1 to 4%) was significantly reduced compared with the number of s. mutans ns cells adhering to glass in the absence of s. mitis. s. mutans ns adhesion in the presence of non-biosurfactant-releasing s. mitis ba and bms was not reduced at all. in addition, preadsorption of isolated s. mitis biosurfactants to glass drastically reduced the adhesion of s. mutans ns cells and the strength of their bonds to glass, as shown by the increased percentage of s. mutans ns cells detached by the passage of air bubbles through the flow chamber. preadsorption of the acid-precipitated fraction inhibited s. mutans adhesion up to 80% in a dose-responsive manner. these observations indicate that  s. mitis plays a protective role in the oral cavity and protects against colonization of saliva-coated surfaces by cariogenic s. mutans.

TI  == variables affecting salivary streptococcus mutans counts in a cohort of 12-year-old subjects.
AB  == background: several factors such as toothbrushing, diet, acidogenic potential of  the mutans streptococci strain and site of the carious lesion can modify the salivary streptococcus mutans (sm) counts. in the present investigation the effect of some behavioural, clinical and microbiological variables on sm salivary counts was evaluated in a cohort of 12-year-olds. methods: forty subjects were examined by two calibrated examiners (gc, al). the number of surfaces either decayed occlusal, decayed smooth or filled and the number of bleeding sextants, (clinical index for oral hygiene) were reported. saliva was collected using a tongue depressor and was plated onto mitis salivarius agar with bacitracin and 20% sucrose. the presumptive sm colonies were counted and the concentrations were logarithmically transformed. one sm strain per subject was identified and the cariogenic potential evaluated as the minimum ph value recorded, during 5 hrs of  incubation in 5% sucrose solution. the children's parents or guardians completed  a questionnaire concerning the frequency of toothbrushing, the consumption of sweet foods and soft drinks and at what age the children started brushing their teeth. the effect of the explanatory variables on sm count logarithms was evaluated by stepwise multiple regression. results: the regressors with significant additional explanatory power were cariogenic potential (b = -1.335, p = 0.00001, r2 increment = 0.312), decayed smooth surfaces (b = -0.456, p = 0.009, r2 increment = 0.114) and bleeding sextants (b = -0.113, p = 0.004, r2 increment  = 0.062), whereas the power of filled surfaces was marginally significant (p = 0.08). conclusions: on the basis of these results, it is suggested that acidogenicity is not only a cariogenic factor, but also a factor promoting colonization of oral sites by sm, especially in subjects with a high frequency of sugar consumption.

TI  == prevalence of the amylase-binding protein a gene (abpa) in oral streptococci.
AB  == salivary amylase binds specifically to a number of oral streptococcal species. this interaction may play an important role in dental plaque formation. recently, a 585-bp gene was cloned and sequenced from streptococcus gordonii challis encoding a 20.5-kda amylase-binding protein (abpa). the goal of this study was to determine if related genes are present in other species of oral streptococci. biotinylated abpa was used in southern blot analysis to screen genomic dna from several strains representing eight species of oral streptococci. this probe hybridized with a 4.0-kb hindiii restriction fragment from all 13 strains of s. gordonii tested. the probe did not appear to bind to any restriction fragments from other species of amylase-binding oral streptococci including streptococcus mitis (with the exception of 1 of 14 strains), streptococcus crista (3 strains),  streptococcus anginosus (1 strain), and streptococcus parasanguinis (1 strain), or to non-amylase-binding oral streptococci including streptococcus sanguinis (3  strains), streptococcus oralis (4 strains), and streptococcus mutans (1 strain).  primers homologous to sequences within the 3' and 5' ends of abpa yielded products of 400 bp following pcr of genomic dna from the southern blot-positive strains. several of these pcr products were cloned and sequenced. the levels of similarity of these cloned products to the abpa of s. gordonii challis ranged from 91 to 96%. these studies reveal that the abpa gene appears to be specific to s. gordonii and differs from genes encoding amylase-binding proteins from other species of amylase-binding streptococci.

AB  == the utility of pcr analysis of transfer dna intergenic spacer length polymorphism (tdna-ilp) for the identification to the species level of clinically relevant viridans streptococci was evaluated with a collection of reference strains of 15  species of the salivarius, anginosus, mitis and mutans rrna homology groups. pcr  products generated by using fluorescent, outwardly directed, consensus tdna primers were analysed by electrophoresis on denaturating polyacrylamide gels and  by laser fluorescence scanning. eleven species showed specific and distinct tdna  patterns: streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis,  streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus criceti and streptococcus ratti. indistinguishable patterns were obtained among two groups of species: streptococcus vestibularis and streptococcus salivarius on the one hand and streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus intermedius on the other. s. mitis strains produced heterogeneous patterns that could be separated into three groups: a group containing s. mitis biovar 1 and two s. mitis biovar 2 groups, one of which clustered with s. parasanguinis strains while the other showed patterns unrelated to other species. these results agree in part with protein electrophoretic analysis showing that s. mitis biovar 2 strains belong to several streptococcal taxa. in conclusion, pcr analysis of tdna-ilp holds promise for rapid identification of viridans streptococci that are difficult to identify by phenotypic tests.

AB  == purpose: to establish a method to measure microbial kill caused by ultrasonic cleaning. secondarily, to estimate the escape of bacteria from the ultrasonic cleaning solutions during operation of the unit. materials and methods: three commercial enzymatic detergents and saline were used as cleaners. depending on detergent, initial operational temperature was 21 degrees c, 37 degrees c or 60 degrees c. streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 (s. mutans suspensions) was adjusted to a final concentration of 1.0 x 10(3) cells/ml in saline. suspensions (2000 ml) at the desired temperatures were added to the cleaner. aliquots were removed, serially diluted in letheen broth and spread plated over mitis salivarius agar. appropriate amounts of detergent solutions were added to s. mutans suspensions and the cleaner operated for 20 minutes. aliquots were then removed and plated. the process was repeated twice. plates were aerobically incubated at 37 degrees c for 7 days and the colonies counted. the procedure was repeated using three temperatures of s. mutans suspensions (21 degrees c, 37 degrees c or 60 degrees c), but without detergent or ultrasound. also, detergents were added to 21 degrees c s. mutans suspensions and allowed to sit for 20 minutes without ultrasonic cleaning. microbial sampling was done as previously described. results: results when ultrasound was used indicated that little kill (5-15%) occurred in 21 degrees c or 37 degrees c detergent solutions. greater kill (25-35%) was noted with 21 degrees c and 37 degrees c saline. complete kill was accomplished with 60 degrees c saline or the 60 degrees c detergent solution. when ultrasound and detergent were not used, there was no kill in 21 degrees c and 37 degrees c saline, but complete kill in 60 degrees c saline. in the absence of ultrasound no kill was noted in 21 degrees c s. mutans suspensions to which detergent had been added. total kill of s. mutans was observed in 60 degrees c saline or 60 degrees c detergent with ultrasound or after a 20-minute exposure in 60 degrees c saline without ultrasonic cleaning. very few bacteria escaped from the ultrasonic cleaning solutions into the air during the cleaning process. placement of the unit lid effectively reduced emissions to zero.

TI  == acid-induced acid tolerance and acidogenicity of non-mutans streptococci.
AB  == acid tolerance and acidogenicity of non-mutans streptococci and their capacity of acid adaptation were studied. the cells of non-mutans streptococci (streptococcus sanguis [streptococcus sanguinis], streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis) grown at ph 7.0 showed 0.0088% to 71% viability after acidification at ph 4.0 for 60 min, whereas the cells of mutans streptococci (streptococcus mutans) were not killed by the acidification. washed cells of non-mutans streptococci lowered ph to 4.04-4.33 in the presence of glucose, while mutans streptococci cells lowered ph to 3.70. when the growth ph was shifted to 5.5 for 30-90 min, the viability of non-mutans streptococci after the acidification at ph 4.0 for 60 min increased (0.25% to 91%) and the minimum ph values of the cells in the presence of glucose decreased (3.90 4.19). along with  the increase in acid tolerance and acidogenicity, non-mutans streptococci increased activities of h(+)-atpase and arginine deiminase and amounts of stress  proteins cross-reacting with 60 kda and 70 kda heat shock proteins (hsp60 and hsp70). these results indicate that non-mutans streptococci were capable of increasing their acid tolerance and acidogenicity in response to environmental acidification. furthermore, it is suggested that the acid adaptation observed in  non-mutans streptococci cells could involve the induction of h(+)-atpase, arginine deiminase and stress protein syntheses. the strains of non-mutans streptococci, which are pioneer bacteria for dental plaque formation and predominant in plaque microbial flora, may play a significant role in shifting the dental plaque environment toward acidic and consequently promoting the colonization of more acid-tolerant and acidogenic bacteria such as mutans streptococci and lactobacilli.

AB  == secretory immunoglobulin a (siga) antibodies reactive with the pioneer oral streptococci streptococcus mitis biovar 1 and streptococcus oralis, the late oral colonizer streptococcus mutans, and the pioneer enteric bacterium enterococcus faecalis in saliva samples from 10 human infants from birth to age 2 years were analyzed. low levels of salivary siga1 and siga2 antibodies reactive with whole cells of all four species were detected within the first month after birth, even  though s. mutans and e. faecalis were not recovered from the mouths of the infants during the study period. although there was a fivefold increase in the concentration of siga between birth and age 2 years, there were no differences between the concentrations of siga1 and siga2 antibodies reactive with the four species over this time period. when the concentrations of siga1 and siga2 antibodies reactive with all four species were normalized to the concentrations of siga1 and siga2 in saliva, siga1 and siga2 antibodies reactive with these bacteria showed a significant decrease from birth to 2 years of age. adsorption of each infant's saliva with cells of one species produced a dramatic reduction of antibodies recognizing the other three species. sequential adsorption of saliva samples removed all siga antibody to the bacteria, indicating that the siga antibodies were directed to antigens shared by all four species. the induction by the host of a limited immune response to common antigens that are likely not involved in adherence may be among the mechanisms that commensal streptococci employ to persist in the oral cavity.

AB  == background and aims: the main bacterial species present in pulpal and periapical  microbic flora is alpha-hemolytic streptococci. they are regarded as facultative  anaerobes which prefer to grow in anaerobiosis. canal irrigation plays an important role in the success of endodontic treatment given that, on the one hand, it encourages the gradual elimination of the smear layer, and on the other  it neutralises microbic flora in the root canal. the aim of this study was to test the microbiological efficacy of sodium hypochlorite 1% and s new generation  irrigant based on chlorhexidine 0.2% and cetrimide 0.2%. methods: the test was performed on the following alpha-hemolytic streptococci bacteria (dasit, cornaredo, italy): streptococcus mitis atcc 9811; streptococcus mutans atcc 35668; streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419; streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556. the working concentration (cfu/ml) was defined as 0.5 mc farland which corresponds to a concentration of microorganisms of approximately 1.5 x 10(8) bacteria. the following canal irrigants were used: 1) cetrimide 0.2% + chlorhexidine 0.2% (cetrexidin vebas, s. giuliano milanese, italy); 2) naocl 1% (ogna, milan, italy). each individual substance remained in contact with the bacterial species  used in the test for 10'-20'-30'. results: the results obtained show the bactericidal efficacy of both the irrigants used, even after a short period of contact. conclusions: this does not mean that all irrigants are equal and/or promise the same results. this was a microbiological study, but it is nonetheless important to take other variables into account, such as contact time. moreover, in order to increase the probabilities for the success of endodontic treatment, canal irrigants must also present other characteristics, namely: biocompatibility, scarce toxicity, high proteolytic power.

TI  == acid-regulated proteins induced by streptococcus mutans and other oral bacteria during acid shock.
AB  == our previous research has demonstrated that with the more aciduric oral bacteria, an acid shock to sub-lethal ph values results in the induction of an acid tolerance response that protects the cells at extremely low ph (ph 3.0-4.0) that  kills unadapted control cells maintained at ph 7.5 (oral microbiol immunol 1997:  12: 266-273). in this study, we were interested in comparing the protein profiles of acid-shocked and control cells of nine organisms from three acid-ogenic genera that could be categorized as strong, weak and non-acid responders in an attempt to identify proteins that could be classified as acid-regulated proteins and which may be important in the process of survival at very low ph. for this, log-phase cultures were rapidly acidified from ph 7.5 to 5.5 in the presence of [14c]-amino acids for varying periods up to 2 h, the period previously shown to be required for maximum induction of the acid response. the cells were extracted  for total protein and subjected to one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide chromatography with comparable control and acid-shocked protein profiles compared by scanning and computer analysis. of particular interest were the proteins in the acid-shocked cells that showed enhanced labeling (i.e., synthesis) over the control cells, since these were considered acid-regulated proteins of importance in ph homeostasis. streptococcus mutans lt11 generated the most rapid and complex pattern: a total of 36 acid-regulated proteins showing enhanced synthesis, with 25 appearing within the first 30 min of acid shock. the enhanced synthesis was transient with all proteins, with the exception of two with molecular weights of 50/49 and 33/32 kda. within the acid-regulated proteins were proteins having molecular weights comparable to the  heat shock proteins and the various subunits of the membrane h+/atpase. by comparison, the strong responder, lactobacillus casei 151, showed the enhanced formation of only nine proteins within the first 30 min of the acid shock, with a total of 11 acid-regulated proteins formed during the 2-h adaptation period with  enhanced synthesis transient for seven of these proteins. streptococcus salivarius at2 and streptococcus gordonii th12 had the formation of 6 and 8 proteins enhanced, while the weakly responding organisms, streptococcus sanguis atcc 10,556 and streptococcus oralis atcc 10,557, exhibited 8 and 6 such proteins, respectively. even non-responding strains unable to survive at very low ph, such as streptococcus sobrinus ch125/43, streptococcus mitis atcc 12,261 and  actinomyces naeslundii 301-13 showed the initial formation of 3-9 acid-regulated  proteins, but protein synthesis was not sustained over the entire adaptation period. clearly, the survival of oral bacteria at very low ph is related, not to  the total number of the acid-regulated proteins induced per se but to the formation of key proteins that function to augment normal ph homeostasis.

AB  == the purpose of the study was to assess the effect of daily supervised rinsing with a specially formulated, alum-containing mouthrinse on plaque and salivary levels of s. mutans, s. mitis and s. salivarius in caries susceptible children (12-14 years old) and to monitor the effect on the oral tissues and acceptability to subjects. forty-five subjects were divided into 3 groups (n = 15). group i received an experimental group with a mouthrinse containing hydrated aluminum potassium sulfate (alum). group 2 received a vehicle control group containing the same mouthrinse, but without alum and group 3 had a treatment control with distilled water. all subjects continued normal oral hygiene habits during the study. salivary and plaque levels were obtained at base line, 2 weeks and 4 weeks and evaluated for microbiologic procedures. also, potential adverse effects on oral tissues were performed during every visit. the mean plaque and salivary levels of oral streptococcus (s. mutans, s. mitis, s. salivarius) for the experimental group were significantly reduced after 2 weeks and 4 weeks compared  with baseline. the plaque and salivary levels of oral streptococcus of experimental and vehicle control group differed statistically from each other after 4 weeks, with the strongest reduction in the experimental group and there was statistically difference between treatment control and vehicle control or experimental groups at each time interval. no evidence of deleterious effects to  the oral tissues was observed. daily use of an alum-containing mouthrinse was safe and produced significant reduction effect on plaque and salivary levels of oral streptococcus and can be used in children for the preventive dentistry.

TI  == antibacterial temporary filling materials: the effect of adding various ratios of ag-zn-zeolite.
AB  == the effect of a new type of antibacterial temporary filling material was evaluated. ag-zn-zeolite (bactekiller, kanebo, japan) and sio2 filler were incorporated into urethane acrylate monomer paste in amounts of 5/55, 10/50, 20/40 and 30/30 wt%, respectively. the present study was designed to use a dye penetration test to measure direct inhibition of bacterial growth of four oral bacteria (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis). the amounts of silver and zinc ions released from these materials were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. the results indicated that the occurrence of marginal leakage was low in all of these materials. these materials exhibited prominent in-vitro antibacterial activity against s. mutans and s. mitis. the ag-zn-zeolite in these materials was able to  release very small but detectable amounts of ag and zn even 4 weeks after the immersion started. the larger the amounts of ag-zn-zeolite that were incorporated, the greater the release of silver and zinc. however, it appears that increasing antibacterial activity is not promoted by the higher ratio of ag-zn-zeolite.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of viridans group streptococci in taiwan with an emphasis on the high rates of resistance to penicillin and macrolides in streptococcus oralis.
AB  == the in-vitro susceptibilities of 13 antimicrobial agents were determined for 207  isolates of viridans group streptococci recovered from patients with significant  infections in taiwan during 1995 and 1997. variable degrees of susceptibility existed among nine species. high-level penicillin resistance (mic > or = 4.0 mg/l) was found most frequently in streptococcus oralis (35%), followed by streptococcus mitis (20%) and streptococcus salivarius (8%). however, s. salivarius showed the lowest rate of susceptibility to penicillin (50%). macrolide resistance also occurred most frequently in s. oralis isolates (55%) but in none of streptococcus mutans. penicillin and macrolides tended to be less  active against isolates recovered from non-invasive sites than against those isolated from invasive sites. imipenem was the most active beta-lactam against penicillin-resistant isolates. ofloxacin, vancomycin and teicoplanin showed good  in-vitro activity against all isolates, with mic90s of 2, 1 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. none of these isolates displayed high-level resistance to gentamicin and most isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol. these results indicate the species-related variability of susceptibility, especially to penicillin, macrolides and tetracycline. in addition to s. mitis, s. oralis also  displayed high rates of resistance to penicillin and macrolides. the difference in susceptibilities between species of viridans streptococci indicates the importance of accurate identification and the need for continuing surveillance of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == study of root caries in an artificial mouth.
AB  == the object of this project was to develop a laboratory model system to study root and enamel caries. model plaque biofilms containing consortia of four (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, actinomyces naeslundii, and lactobacillus rhamnosus) or six (s mutans, s sobrinus, s mitis, a naeslundii, l rhamnosus, and veillonella dispar) species of caries pathogens were developed in  a artificial mouth. caries lesions similar to those found in vivo were produced on enamel and dentine blocks and in intact root tissues by these consortia more effectively than biofilms of the individual species. fluoride supplied at 5 ppm suppressed enamel caries effectively, less so dentinal lesion formation, but much more so than f incorporated into the mineralised surface of enamel and roots. this is the first direct comparison of the effect on caries of environmental f and tooth mineral f induced by a plaque-like bacterial biofilm.

TI  == identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.

AB  == the separate and combined effects of peroxidase-generated hypothiocyanite (hoscn/oscn-) and f- ions on glucose uptake and growth of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 were investigated. s. mutans cells were grown to late exponential or stationary growth phase, harvested, washed and suspended in 2.0 ml of sterilized  human whole saliva supplemented with 10 mm d-glucose. this saliva-bacteria mixture was supplemented with 5-150 microm h2o2 at ph 5.0 or 6.5. at ph 5.0, up to 103 +/- 21 microm hoscn/oscn- was generated. after 20 h of incubation at 37 degrees c, the saliva-bacteria suspension exposed to hoscn/oscn- were plated on mitis salivarius agar plates and incubated anaerobically for 2 days. identical experiments were made with f- ions (0.5, 1.0 and 5.0 mm). both hoscn/oscn- and f- caused a significant dose-dependent growth inhibition at ph 5.0, whereas no inhibition was observed at ph 6.5. when f- and hoscn/oscn- were added simultaneously at ph 5.0, an additive effect of growth inhibition was observed. in glucose incorporation experiments the bacteria-saliva mixture was exposed to 1 microm hoscn/oscn-, 0.5 mm f- or both. f-, hoscn/oscn- or their combination in sterilized whole saliva at ph 5.0 caused 14.2, 67.8 and 74.2% inhibition, respectively. these observations indicate that f- and hoscn/oscn- ions have an additive inhibitory effect on s. mutans and therefore their combination is likely to be more antibacterial than either agent alone.

TI  == variations in the predominant cultivable microflora of dental plaque at defined subsites on approximal tooth surfaces in children.
AB  == the distribution and composition of the resident microflora were determined in approximal gingival margin plaque from 21 premolars extracted from schoolchildren (mean age 12.0 +/- 1.8 yr). indigo carmine (5% w v) was used to visualize plaque  to facilitate sampling. about 1 mm2 of plaque was removed from sites away from (a), to the side of (s), and below (b) the contact area. plaque samples were dispersed, serially diluted, and cultured on selective and non-selective agar media. an average of seven to nine species was found at each subsite. streptococcus and actinomyces were subdivided on the basis of a range of biochemical tests. the predominant actinomyces and streptococcal species at most  subsites were a. naeslundii and strep. mitis biovar i. a. naeslundii and a. odontolyticus were isolated more often at subsite b (90.5 and 57.1%, respectively), and a. israelii at subsite s (66.7%) strep. mitis 1 and strep. sanguis were found more frequently at subsite s (76.2 and 66.7% respectively), whereas strep mutans, strep. sobrinus, strep. gordonii and veillonella spp. were  recovered most commonly from subsite b (85.7, 33.3, 38.1 and 76.2%, respectively). the isolation frequencies of strep. mutans and strep. sobrinus were significantly higher at subsite b (a b p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). veillonella spp. were significantly higher at subsites b and s (a < b, p > 0.01;  b > s, p < 0.05), while neisseria spp. were most common at subsite a (a > b. p >  0.03). igal protease-producing species were found at each subsite, but they formed only a small proportion of the total streptococcus population. this study  has shown that local variations were evident at different subsites, both with respect to species prevalence and to proportions of each species within each subsite. the population shifts in gingival margin plaque appear to relate to the  location of plaque in relation to the most caries-prone site below the contact area b.

TI  == does assessment of microbial composition of plaque/saliva allow for diagnosis of  disease activity of individuals?
AB  == microbiological tests are limited in their applicability in the assessment of caries activity and in caries prediction. they can be effective in group of persons with high or low caries experience. the reasons for the limitation of microbiological tests rests with unique characteristics of the microflora and local environments of the oral cavity, which will modify the cariogenicity of plaque in an individual. thus, high numbers of s. mutans may be associated with the development of a lesion at a site, while a second susceptible site with high  levels of this organism in the same subject will remain caries free. this paper identifies some aspects of oral bacteria which can contribute to the unique nature of the microflora associated with plaque in an individual. firstly, the range of bacteria potentially involved in caries has widened and now includes, for example, 'low ph' non-mutans streptococci. the presence of such organisms in  plaque in an individual may influence early enamel demineralization. most significantly, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis and actinomyces naeslundii have been shown to be comprise many distinct clones, with different distribution among subjects. little is known of the impact of clonal diversity on caries activity but in some bacterial diseases particular clones are associated with virulence. therefore, possession of a particular clone or clones by an individual could be related to caries activity. also, the extent of clonal diversity may reflect the nature of the oral environment. recent studies suggest  that cells are released from biofilms, during adherence and growth, i.e. the early phases of development. thus, determination of the numbers of a given species in non-stimulated saliva may indicate whether it is actively growing in plaque. microbiological tests on the oral flora should perhaps be used to monitor the status of the oral cavity, after establishing a norm for the individual patient. research on species and clonal diversity of oral bacteria among human populations; diversity and its role in the caries process; and the liberation of  biofilm cells could provide data to allow better appreciation and evaluation of the results of microbiological testing.

TI  == mitis salivarius-bacitracin 10% sacarose agar for oral streptococci and streptococcus mutans counts.
AB  == the msb agar (mitis salivarius-bacitracin) 20% sacarose medium is frequently used for the isolation and count of total streptococci and streptococcus mutans. although it is considered a selective culture medium for this micro-organism, s.  mutans recovery in this medium is much lower than in this mitis salivarius agar (msa). because the number of s. mutans in saliva is used for estimating caries risk and activity from a microbiological stand point, the aim of this work was to find a modification of the msb 20% sacarose medium so that it would offer not only selectivity in the isolation but also maximum recovery. this would detect people at risk more efficiency and would evaluate the preventive odontological treatments more accurately. the results show that: 1) the greatest recovery of total streptococci and s. mutans is obtained in the msb 10% sacarose medium, 2) s. mutans must be incubated in aerobiosis and the total streptococci in a candle  jar (10% co2). msb 10% sacarose medium is proposed as a choice medium for the microbiological estimation of cariogenic risk and activity, to detect infection levels and evaluate preventive odontological treatments.

AB  == given the hypothesis that root caries is the result of acid formation by acidogenic micro-organisms, the present study was performed to relate sucrose-induced ph response of dental plaque on root surfaces to the microbial composition of the overlying plaque. seventeen caries-active elderly chinese with poor oral hygiene and with both sound and carious root surfaces were examined. plaque ph was measured before and up to one hour after a controlled sucrose mouthrinse. plaque samples for microbiologic analyses were collected from 2 sound and 2 or 3 carious ph-measurement sites in each subject. the prevalence of the following micro-organisms was assessed as % of total viable counts on brucella agar: prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, fusobacterium nucleatum,  campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga spp., actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundi, streptococcus spp., s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus spp., and candida spp. there was no difference in plaque ph response on sound and carious root surfaces. the plaque ph response was more pronounced in the maxilla than in the mandible for both sound and carious sites.  there was no difference in microbial composition of dental plaque on sound and carious root surfaces. the ph response to sucrose was the same regardless of the  presence or absence of mutans streptococci. our results thus do not readily support the traditional concept of caries formation.

TI  == antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  == in addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. this investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol,  super eba and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli b and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella (bacteroides) intermedia, prevotella (bacteroides) melaninogenica, fusobacterium  necrophorum, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. after growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials  were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees c. impregnated discs with the super eba liquid were used as positive controls. the antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials.  impregnated discs with super eba liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. zinc  oxide-eugenol and super eba pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == effectiveness of ethylene oxide for sterilization of dental handpieces.
AB  == ethylene oxide gas has been utilized as an alternative method for sterilization of dental handpieces, as it is less corrosive than steam. however, its effectiveness for sterilization of the internal components of dental handpieces has not been established. the objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of ethylene oxide and steam for sterilization of dental handpieces. unused handpieces and handpieces which had been exposed to clinical dental procedures ('clinical') were contaminated with streptococcus mutans, exposed to steam or ethylene oxide, and flushed with sterile saline. washings were plated on mitis-salivarius agar, and colonies identified and counted. no viable colonies could be established from washings from 'clinical' or 'unused' handpieces exposed to steam. however, viable colonies could be established from 'clinical' handpieces exposed to ethylene oxide. this data suggests that a substance entrapped within 'clinical' handpieces (possibly the biofilm) may protect bacteria from ethylene oxide gas, preventing adequate sterilization.

TI  == differences in the detection and enumeration of mutans streptococci due to differences in methods.
AB  == different methods reported for assessing mutans streptococci (ms) make the direct comparisons of results across studies difficult. to quantitate the variations of  ms estimates attributable to differences in method, stimulated and unstimulated saliva samples and oral swab samples were compared with pooled dental-plaque samples. detection of ms in stimulated saliva samples was in excellent agreement  with the presence of ms in pooled plaque samples. ms detection in unstimulated saliva samples, however, was significantly discordant with that in either pooled  plaque or oral swab samples. when caries status was used as the criterion of validity of ms estimates, stimulated saliva samples demonstrated a sensitivity (94%) similar to that of pooled plaque samples, but exhibited a lower specificity (11%) than that of pooled plaque samples (17%). as a result, the measure of association between ms and caries was biased (towards null) when ms status was based on stimulated saliva samples. interestingly though, in enumerating ms, stimulated saliva samples yielded significantly higher levels of ms (about 1.5 log10 increase) with a lower variability compared to unstimulated saliva samples. the use of different culture media for detection of ms gave different results as  well. ms detection was poor (kappa = 0.31) and ms levels were lower (p = 0.0001)  when samples were grown on glucose-sucrose-potassium tellurite-bacitracin agar compared to mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. together with the relative ease of  sampling and processing, these findings collectively justify the use of plaque samples for the qualitative assessment of ms and stimulated saliva samples for the quantitative assessment of ms, while providing a basis for adjustment of estimates when comparing results across studies.

AB  == it is not known whether the aetiology of occlusal hidden caries lesions (hcl) is  identical to that of small visible lesions (svl). previous studies of the microflora of hcl suggest that relatively few species can be isolated. the aim of the present study was to compare the bacterial composition of dentine from 10 hcl and 17 svl in a population of children aged 8-18 years. the following bacteria were identified: actinomyces spp., mutans streptococci, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii. streptococcus mitis, and lactobacillus spp. streptococcus mutans was found more often in the hcl group (p  = 0.03), while streptococcus sobrinus was found more often in the svl group (p =  0.05). however, proportions of both species were lower in the svl group as compared with the hcl group (s. mutans p = 0.07; s. sobrinus p = 0.03). lactobacilli and actinomyces spp. were found at similar levels in both groups. a  more diverse range of streptococcal species and veillonella was found in the svl  group (p = 0.001). these results show a less complex microflora in hcl as compared with svl, indicating that the aetiology of hidden caries might be different from that of open caries.

TI  == streptococci and actinomyces inhibit regrowth of streptococcus mutans on gnotobiotic rat molar teeth after chlorhexidine varnish treatment.
AB  == clinical studies suggest that the long-term suppression of mutans streptococci on tooth surfaces after intensive chlorhexidine therapy is mainly due to bacterial interference. other streptococci and also actinomyces naeslundii are proposed to  inhibit regrowth of mutans streptococci after suppression by the agent. we have tested this hypothesis in gnotobiotic rats associated with streptococcus mutans alone, or associated with s. mutans and strains of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis biovar i, and  a. naeslundii. left lower jaws in these rats were treated with concentrated chlorhexidine varnish, and the return of s. mutans on the treated jaws monitored. in mono-associated rats, s. mutans regained the level of the untreated right lower jaw in approximately 1 week. in contrast, s. mutans remained suppressed for several weeks in rats multi-associated with other streptococci and actinomyces strains. the suppression was more pronounced in the rats fed on basal diet with little free sugars than in rats fed on a sucrose-containing diet. counts of other streptococci recovered quickly from the intensive chlorhexidine treatment, but a. naeslundii remained suppressed for at least 1 week. the findings demonstrate the  crucial importance of the oral microflora in controlling regrowth of mutans streptococci after chemotherapy.

TI  == the relationship between dental caries in the primary dentition and anti s. mutans serum antibodies in children with down's syndrome.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the status of dental caries in seventy-five subjects with down's syndrome, ages two to eighteen years and to evaluate the relationship between dental plaque or caries experience and serum antibody titers against s. mutans and s. mitis. these antibodies were examined since an enhanced host response to s. mutans might be responsible for the low caries prevalence in down's syndrome. antibody titers were determined using the enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (elisa) and titers were expressed in elisa units. the frequency of all subjects who were caries-free was 46.1%, while 61.4%  of the subjects under five years were caries-free. the average dmft score in the  subjects of hellman dental age group i (primary dentition) was 15.9. the highest  frequency of caries occurred on occlusal surfaces, followed by proximal surfaces  of the upper incisors and smooth surfaces on incisors. the severity of dental caries in the subjects with down's syndrome was bipolar and could be categorized  as either mild or severe. in the subjects having a primary dentition, a significant positive correlation was found in the relationship between the original caries severity score (ocss) and the plaque score. there was also a significant positive correlation between ocss and igm antibody titer to s. mutans. in contrast, no correlation between antibody titers to s. mitis and these variables was found. it is not clear if these antibodies are protective and responsible for the reduced caries rate seen in down's syndrome.

TI  == [clinical significance of bacteremia caused by streptococci of the viridans group].
AB  == background: the viridans group streptococcus (svg) include species which may have different pathogenic capacity. this study was aimed at evaluating the clinical significance of bacteremia by different species of svg. patients and methods: one hundred ninety-four clinical records of patients with blood culture(s) isolation  (hemoline/biomerieux) of svg (api 20 strep/biomerieux) over 9 years were reviewed with criteria of clinical significance being established and the results analyzed by the chi square test. results: the most frequent species of svg isolated were:  s. sanguis ii (29.4%), s. mitis (27.3%) and s. anginosus (12.9%). with regard to  the criteria established, 36% of the isolates were clinically significant, associating s. anginosus with significant bacteremia (p = 0.001) and s. mitis with non significant bacteremia (p = 0.04). more than half of the isolations of s. anginosus, s. bovis, s. mutans and s. adjacens were clinically significant with this rate being lower in the remaining species (s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii, s. mitis, s. salivarius and s. acidominimus). the significant isolations correspond with endocarditis (s. sanguis ii being responsible for 44%; p = 0.05). in 54.3% of the cases followed by abscesses or other localized infections and severe sepsis in patients with a solid or hematologic tumor with a mortality of 20%. the endocarditis/other disease relation was: greater for the existence of endocarditis for s. sanguis ii, s. sanguis i, s. mutans, s. bovis and s. adjacens; similar in both diseases for s. mitis, and greater for the existence of a non endocardic disease for s. anginosus. conclusions: in this series the isolation of svg group was clinically significant in 36% of cases with a probability of clinical significance and disease association related to the species isolated of svg.

TI  == site-related streptococcal attachment to buccocervical tooth surfaces. a correlative micromorphologic and microbiologic study.
AB  == scanning electron (sem) microscopy of epoxy replicas made from dental impressions has shown that in buccal gingival recession the root surfaces are devoid of cementum, leaving the dentin exposed. in this study replication techniques were applied to correlate the micromorphology of the buccocervical region with early streptococcal attachment. the subjects were 27 healthy young adults. the buccocervical surfaces of all the premolars were meticulously cleaned. the subjects fasted for 2 h before impression-taking. replicas were made from impressions in hydrophilic a-silicone, and streptococcal attachment was visualized by light microscopy of mitis-salivarius agar replicas incubated anaerobically for 48 h. the surface micromorphology was documented by sem of corresponding epoxy replicas. colonization only 2 h after cleaning was very sparse. sites with healthy or inflamed gingivae had markedly different colonization patterns in the sulcular region. in 4 subjects with a total of 12 sites where gingival recession, undetected clinically, was disclosed by sem, representative colonies were retrieved and identified microbiologically to species level. two healthy sites per subject were also sampled. streptococcus mutans and s. sobrinus were identified from eight sites with exposed root dentin. s. oralis predominated on the enamel surfaces. the method offers a valuable complement to in situ and in vitro microbiologic studies of exposed dentin and a  novel technique for sampling clinical isolates of streptococci.

TI  == all forms of human iga antibodies bound to antigen interfere with complement (c3) fixation induced by igg or by antigen alone.
AB  == polyclonal human secretory iga1 and iga2 antibodies to a bacterial protein antigen streptococcus mutans agi/ii, and polyclonal human serum iga1 and iga2 antibodies to staphylococcal alpha-toxin, were found to interfere with antigen-mediated c3b fixation. in fluid phase, immune complexes of antigen and iga failed to fix c3b, whereas antigen-igg complexes did fix c3b. partial removal of glycan chains with streptococcus mitis sk96 glycosidases diminished the capacity of iga antibodies to interfere with antigen-mediated c3b fixation by the alternative complement pathway. the authors conclude that native serum or secretory iga antibodies suppress c3b fixation, and that the glycan chains play a significant role in maintaining this property.

TI  == conservation of salivary glycoprotein-interacting and human immunoglobulin g-cross-reactive domains of antigen i/ii in oral streptococci.
AB  == in this study we localized more precisely the salivary glycoprotein-interacting and the human immunoglobulin g (higg)-cross-reacting domains on the sr molecule,  an antigen i/ii-related protein from s. mutans serotype f. mapping of the sr molecule with polypeptides expressed by subclones covering the entire molecule and with synthetic peptides demonstrates that the salivary glycoprotein-binding domain is located in the n-terminal alanine-rich repeats of the sr molecule. in order to investigate the degree of conservation of both regions in various oral streptococci, we tested the reactivity of 8 representative strains of the mutans  group and 11 nonmutans oral streptococcus strains (s. anginosus, s. milleri, s. constellatus, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. sanguis, s. gordonii, s. salivarius, and s. mitis strains) with antipeptide antibodies in a whole-cell enzyme linked immunosorbent assay together with colony hybridization analysis using dna probes  designed to map these two regions. all the mutans group strains except s. rattus  and the 11 nonmutans streptococcal strains showed a high conservation of the c-terminal part of the sr molecule, especially the higg-cross-reacting domain, and less homology for the n-terminal salivary glycoprotein-binding region. almost all of the sera from patients with rheumatic disease reacted strongly with sr from s. mutans serotype f, p1 from s. mutans serotype c, and four peptides located in the higg-cross-reacting region and not with peptides located at the c  and n termini and in the proline-rich repeats. these results confirm that epitopes located within this region are immunogenic in humans and could lead to the synthesis of natural anti-igg antibodies.

TI  == mucin-sulphatase activity of some oral streptococci.
AB  == mucin-sulphatase activity, measured using a 35s-[so4(2-)]-labelled colonic mucin  substrate, was detected in whole cells of streptococci isolated from the human oral cavity. the highest levels of sulphatase activity were found in all strains  of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis and in half of the strains of streptococcus mutans tested. little or no activity was detected in 9 of the 11 streptococcus oralis strains examined, in the 4 streptococcus constellatus strains, and in the 3 streptococcus anginosus isolates tested. the highest enzyme levels were obtained from the two fresh streptococcus gordonii isolates. this is  the first report of such activity in oral microorganisms. streptococcal mucin-sulphatase may contribute to the destruction of salivary mucins and mitigate their protective functions in the oral cavity, and be a determinant in the development of dental caries.

TI  == interaction of the salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with the bacterium streptococcus salivarius hb.
AB  == the interaction of the human salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with a number of oral bacterial species, following incubation with human whole saliva, has been investigated. ep-gp could be detected with a specific monoclonal antibody, by means of elisa or by electrophoresis in combination with western transfer. the results indicated that ep-gp is bound only by streptococcus salivarius, and not by the other tested strains of bacteria, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides fragilis, s. gordonii, s. oralis, s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. rattus, s. constellatus, and s. anginosus. binding of ep-gp to s. salivarius is mediated by a protein-protein interaction, which was found to be ph-dependent with a maximum binding between ph 5 and 6. for further characterization of the binding of ep-gp  to s. salivarius, four mutants were tested, each of them lacking different cell wall antigens. ep-gp was bound to all mutants in amounts comparable with the wildtype, in spite of the different surface antigen compositions. we were able to identify a 27-kd ep-gp binding protein, by extraction of s. salivarius-cell wall  antigens and electrophoretic techniques. in addition to ep-gp, s. salivarius also bound two other salivary proteins, namely, secretory iga and low-molecular-weight mucin (mg-2).

TI  == antibacterial effectiveness of dentin bonding systems.
AB  == this study examined the antibacterial activities of several commercially available glass ionomer cements, dentin bonding systems and luting agents by employing both agar plate diffusion (apd) and growth inhibition (gi) methods. amalgam and resin composites were also tested as control materials. in both methods (apd and gi), cylindrical specimens were used. four bacteria strains were tested: streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius, s. mitis and s. sanguis. these studies were performed using standardized innoculums with selective media, and the assayed materials were directly applied on the assay cultures and plates. the results of agar plate assay were in accordance with the results of growth inhibition method. the glass ionomer cements showed marked antibacterial activity. on the contrary, amalgam, composites, luting agents and dentinal bonding systems did not affect bacterial growth. the sensitivity of the growth method showed that all the strains were inhibited in the same way by each inhibitory material. the data suggest that the use of glass ionomer cements as cavity liners/bases may reduce the consequences of microleakage due to its antibacterial properties.

TI  == the resistance and adaptation of selected oral bacteria to mercury and its impact on their growth.
AB  == selected strains of oral streptococcus and actinomyces have been tested for their ability to grow in the presence of mercury. strains were tested for growth on a semi-defined medium with low mercury-binding characteristics. sensitivities were  initially measured on agar plates, and subsequently, selected strains were grown  in broth so that the impact of mercury on the growth characteristics could be determined. streptococci were more resistant to mercury (5 micrograms/ml to 40 micrograms/ml) than actinomyces (< 5 micrograms/ml to 30 micrograms/ml). the most resistant streptococci included s. mitis biovar 1, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, and one strain of s. mutans, all of which grew on agar with 40 micrograms/ml of mercury. two other s. mutans strains were more sensitive, being inhibited by 10 and 20 micrograms/ml mercury. the most resistant actinomyces was a. naeslundii genospecies 1 (atcc12104), which grew on medium with 30 micrograms/ml mercury; two strains of actinomyces were completely inhibited by 5 micrograms/ml. mercury  caused increased lag times and reduced cell density in broth cultures. enrichment cultures of samples of human dental plaque showed that streptococci were the most resistant organisms that could be cultured on the medium and that these strains could adapt to relatively high mercury concentrations. s. oralis and s. mitis biovar 1 were the most resistant organisms isolated from enriched cultures, growing in broth media with 65 micrograms/ml mercury. mercury was bound to cell walls and cell cytoplasm of streptococci grown in the presence of mercury.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == longitudinal study of relations between human salivary antimicrobial proteins and measures of dental plaque accumulation and composition.
AB  == many studies have attempted to relate levels of antimicrobial proteins in saliva  to oral health; results have been inconsistent, and one reason might be inconsistency of measures of plaque and saliva within subjects. this study investigated associations between plaque and salivary variables in longitudinal data. whole saliva, and 8-h plaque pooled from buccal first permanent molars, was obtained from 32 dental students on tuesdays from 3:00-6:00 p.m. over 4 weeks. salivary flow rate was determined, and samples were assayed for lysozyme, lactoferrin, total peroxidase, myeloperoxidase, oscn-, siga and total protein. colonies on mitis-salivarius agar were assigned to streptococcus sanguis, strep.  mutans or strep. salivarius on the basis of morphology, supplemented by the api rapid strep identification system. consistency of values within subjects across weeks was evaluated by repeat-measures analysis of variance and intraclass correlation; data were transformed to reduce skewness. pearson's r was used to determine associations between plaque and salivary variables. significant intraclass correlations (alpha = 0.05) were found for all salivary variables except myeloperoxidase, and for total flora, total streptococci, strep. sanguis and strep. sanguis as a proportion of total streptococci. significant pearson correlations with strep. sanguis as a proportion of total streptococci were found for total protein (r = -0.24), siga (r = -0.22), lactoferrin (r = -0.19) and oscn- (r = 0.20) when data from all weeks were pooled (n = 128). strep. sanguis proportions tended to be low in subjects with high values for salivary proteins;  the range of proportions was wider in subjects with low salivary values. these findings suggest some consistency of weekly values for many plaque and salivary variables. they also support previous cross-sectional data which suggested that salivary antimicrobial proteins may have some effect on plaque composition. this  study was made before recent revisions in streptococcal taxonomy, and further research is needed to clarify interactions of salivary proteins with currently defined species.

AB  == both intra- and inter-individual variation in salivary flow rate, buffer effect,  and the levels of salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were analyzed in  128 11-year-old children. the follow-up period was 9 months, with six saliva samplings done at regular intervals. inter-individual variation was relatively large in paraffin-stimulated salivary flow rate: low (< 1.0 ml/min) and high (> or = 2.0 ml/min) flow rates were measured in 18% and 13% of the children, respectively. intraindividual variation during the follow-up period was found in  63% of the boys and in 73% of the girls. the buffer effect stayed stable in all samplings in 59% of the boys and in 42% of the girls. buffer effect was significantly (p < 0.001) lower in girls than in boys. mutans streptococci were analyzed by a chair-side method (strip mutans test) and by cultivation on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin (msb) agar plates. the results of the two methods correlated highly significantly (r = 0.79, p < 0.001). with the strip mutans test no variation in test scores occurred in 49% of all subjects in all six samplings, whereas the respective percentage for msb scores was only 19%. no variation in salivary lactobacilli occurred in only 18% of the subjects, and in 13% the intraindividual variation was as high as > or = 3 logs. these results show that in young teenagers with a developing dentition, simultaneous changes in behavioral, hormonal, and dietary factors make single-point measurements of salivary factors too unreliable for caries-diagnostic or predictive purposes.

AB  == the isolation frequency and distribution of eight recently defined streptococcal  species have been investigated in the saliva of adults and that of both predentate and dentate children. the effects of frequency of sugar intake and tooth presence on the distribution of streptococcal species were also analyzed. saliva samples were collected from 121 subjects divided into three study groups:  (a) 56 predentate children (predentate group), (b) 37 dentate children (dentate group), and (c) 28 adults (adult group). up to 17 biochemical and enzymatic tests were used to categorize streptococcal isolates into s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. anginosus, s. sanguis, s. vestibularis, s. mutans, and s. gordonii. the mean total and streptococcal salivary colony-forming units (cfu) were lowest in the predentate group and highest in the adult group. streptococci  were found in all the study subjects, and there was no obvious relationship between the total or streptococcal cfu and the number of teeth or the frequency of sugar intake. there was a wide variation in the isolation frequency of streptococcal species in the three study groups. s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. salivarius were the most frequent species isolated, and together they comprised 83% of the total streptococcal isolates. in contrast to studies using older classifications, s. sanguis was a minor species in the saliva though found more often in adults than in children (p < 0.04). s. anginosus was a minor species found in about 10% of adults and children. s. gordonii was detected rarely and only in dentate subjects. s. mutans was detected only in dentate subjects, significantly greater in adults (57.1%) than in children (5.4%, p < 0.001).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == prevalence of dental caries in 4- to 5-year-old children partly explained by presence of salivary mutans streptococci.
AB  == the correlation between dental caries and the number of oral mutans group streptococci (ms) present has been shown to be weak. the aim of this investigation was to study associations between caries experience (decayed, missing, and filled surfaces [dmfs]) and the number of ms in stimulated saliva, with emphasis on the level of disease and the confounding effect of regular intake of sweets, the presence of salivary lactobacilli, and oral hygiene. in some 2,700 4- to 5-year-old south african children of different ethnic origins, caries was diagnosed on the basis of world health organization criteria and saliva samples were analyzed for ms after cultivation on mitis salivarius-bacitracin agar and for lactobacilli by using the dentocult kit. oral  hygiene was scored on the basis of the greene and vermillion simplified debris index, while data on intake of sweets were derived from extensive interviews. pearson's coefficient of correlation was computed, and multiple regression analysis was performed to correct for confounding factors. the distribution of the children in the eight caries classes was strongly associated with the ms class (p < 0.001), with those in the lower ms classes generally having low dmfs scores and those in the higher ms classes having dmfs scores distributed over the whole range. the r value for the two variables was 0.25 for the total material; this was reduced to 0.18 by correction for confounding factors. the corresponding values for children with caries were 0.21 and 0.17, for those in the 1 to 6 dmfs  interval they were 0.07 and 0.03, and for those in the 7 to 81 dmfs interval they were 0.16 and 0.14. the data imply that the explanatory values for ms, those for  the lower caries interval not counted, ranged from 6 to 2%. the unexpected results for children with caries might be due to their distribution pattern. it is concluded that there is a need for reevaluation of ms as a risk factor in dental caries.

TI  == emergence of immune competence in saliva.
AB  == saliva contains essentially no iga at birth. however, secretory immune responses  to oral and non-oral microbial antigens emerge early in life. we have investigated the characteristics of these responses in salivas of infants less than 1 month through 4 years of age, using cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches. antibody specificities (iga, iga1, and iga2) were measured in elisa and western blot analysis to antigens of streptococcus mitis and s. salivarius that colonize during the neonatal period. antibodies reactive with s. sanguis and mutans streptococci, which colonize later in the infant's life, were also determined. concurrent investigation of the oral flora of each infant was performed and related to the observed antibody specificities. the secretory nature of the immunoglobulins in these salivas was analyzed immunologically and chromatographically. the primary molecular form of salivary iga was dimeric in all salivas tested. both iga subclasses were found, although a subset of infant salivas initially contained > 90% iga1. igm (> 1 microgram/ml) was detected in 58% of 3- to 17-week-old infants. by 2 months of age, salivas from most infants contained iga antibody reactive with at least two s. mitis components. many salivas also contained antibody reactive with s. salivarius components. by the end of the first year, most salivas contained iga1 and iga2 antibody to s. mitis  antigens. maturation of secretory responses in the second and third year was evidenced by the appearance of increased concentrations and additional specificities of salivary iga antibodies to s. mitis antigens. antibody to s. mitis, s. salivarius, and s. sanguis extracellular components was detected only after infection with the respective species.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == dental caries and its determinants among recent immigrants from rural ethiopia.
AB  == adults (35-45 yr old) and children (5 and 12 yr old) recently arrived in israel from rural areas in ethiopia were examined. caries levels were low: e.g. dmft = 0.31 among 12-yr-olds, and 1.27 amongst adults. the 5-yr-olds were 86.8% caries-free, while 12-yr-olds were 81.8% and adults 54% caries-free respectively. according to interview data, the diet in ethiopia had been based on local agricultural products and was almost sugar-free. the mean total count of salivary bacteria, as determined on blood agar, was 3.4 x 10(8); mean count of streptococcus viridans, on mitis salivarius, was 6.7 x 10(7); and mean count of s. mutans, as determined on mitis salivarius with bacitracin, was 1.7 x 10(7). these levels were all high and were not significantly different from a control group of 20 israelis. the mean number of lactobacilli, on rogosa agar, was 2.75 x 10(4), which was significantly higher than among the controls (3.6 x 10(3). salivary ph levels were generally similar between the ethiopian group and the controls. salivary flow was significantly higher for the ethiopians (1.93 ml/min) than for controls (1.16 ml/min). low levels of caries in this population can be attributed to an almost sugar-free diet and high salivary flow, but not to the composition of oral microflora.

AB  == antigen extracts of 9 strains of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis were separated in acrylamide gels by electrophoresis. strains of the same genotype of mutans streptococci were found to have virtually identical sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis patterns but differed clearly from other genotypes of mutans or with the reference strains s. salivarius and s. mitis. immunoglobulin a (iga) antibody activity to antigens of s. mutans, s. sobrinus and s. mitis in the parotid, submandibular and whole saliva of 12 people was detected by western blotting. iga antibodies reacted with several of the antigens, and the reaction pattern was unique for each of the individuals. to certain antigens, all the salivas blotted bands if both clear and questionable bands were counted. significantly more blotted bands were revealed with antigens from s. mutans than  s. sobrinus. the results of the 3 different salivas of the same individual had a  high degree of resemblance but in a few individuals, more blotted bands were obtained with parotid saliva to s. mutans and s. sobrinus antigens.

TI  == serum antibody responses to streptococcus mutans antigens in humans systemically  infected with oral streptococci.
AB  == sera from patients with subacute bacterial endocarditis (sbe) due to streptococcus mutans or other oral streptococci and from normal subjects were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies to defined s. mutans  antigens. antibodies of igg and iga isotypes to ag i/ii and ag iii were greatly elevated in s. mutans-sbe sera, and the iga antibodies in 3 sera included both polymeric and monomeric forms. elevated igm and igg anti-lipoteichoic acid and igg and iga anti-serotype c polysaccharide antibodies were also found. the sera of 4 of 6 patients infected with other oral streptococci also displayed antibodies to s. mutans ag i/ii. sera of 3 patients infected with streptococcus mitis or streptococcus oralis, but none of the s. mutans-infected cases, showed elevated antibodies to human heart sarcolemma, and all sbe sera had elevated rheumatoid factor. these results suggest that the known surface protein antigens  of s. mutans are immunodominant in humans, and are not likely to be heart cross-reactive.

TI  == a comparison between commercial kits and conventional methods for enumeration of  salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli.
AB  == mutans streptococci (ms) and lactobacilli levels were determined by conventional  and commercial dip-slide methods in three groups of young subjects, aged 5-6 years (93 subjects), 12-13 years (78 subjects) and 18-20 years (81 subjects). using the same paraffin-stimulated saliva samples, ms and lactobacilli were estimated by conventional viable counts on modified mitis-salivarius agar (msb) and rogosa agar plates, and by inoculation of dentocult sm and dentocult lb dip-slides (orion diagnostica, finland). the salivary ms and lactobacilli counts  obtained from conventional agar plates were significantly correlated (p < 0.0001) with the dip-slide estimates of these organisms (kendal tau = 0.56, 0.71 respectively). subjects in group 2 showed the highest proportion (77 per cent) of individuals with salivary ms levels above 2.5 x 10(5) cfu/ml saliva; 99 per cent  of that group had detectable levels of lactobacilli. significantly different median salivary ms and lactobacilli levels were demonstrated between all groups except for lactobacilli levels between groups 2 and 3. these dip-slide tests provided suitable and simple methods for screening salivary lactobacilli and ms levels which may have a useful role in the assessment of caries risk.

AB  == the streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferase (gtf) genes gtfb and gtfc were ligated into escherichia coli-streptococcus shuttle plasmids and introduced into  streptococcus milleri. gtfb transformant ksb8 formed an s. mutans-like rough colony on mitis salivarius agar and expressed an extracellular gtf-i, of 158 kda, and two cell-bound gtf-is, of 158 and 135 kda. gtfc transformant ksc43 formed a semirough colony on mitis salivarius agar and expressed primarily an extracellular gtf-si, of 146 kda, and two cell-bound gtf-sis, of 146 and 152 kda. the extracellular gtfs from ksb8 and ksc43 were purified and characterized. the two types of gtf also reacted specifically with monoclonal antibodies directed against each enzyme. both enzymes synthesized significant amounts of oligosaccharides, consisting primarily of alpha-1,6-glucosidic linkages, as well  as water-insoluble glucans, containing alpha-1,3-glucosidic linkages. insoluble-glucan-synthesizing activities of both enzymes were stimulated (three-  to sixfold) by the addition of dextran t10 and were inhibited in the presence of  1.5 m ammonium sulfate. the km(s) for sucrose and the optimal phs were also similar for both enzymes. however, when the transformants were grown in todd-hewitt broth supplemented with sucrose, ksc43 cells, expressing gtf-si activity, adhered to glass surfaces in vitro, while ksb8 cells, expressing gtf-i  activity, did not. these results are discussed relative to the potential role of  the gtfb and gftc genes in s. mutans cariogenicity.

TI  == purification and properties of sorbitol-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from oral streptococci.
AB  == the activity of sorbitol-6-phosphate (s6p) dehydrogenase (s6pdh) and the sorbitol transport system were studied in strains of the oral streptococci streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans. genetically transformed (to ferment sorbitol) strains and their dna donors were included. s6pdh was purified by anion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. the purity of the enzyme was confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the purified enzyme from all the strains exhibited michaelis-menton saturation kinetics. the km values for nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (nad) and s6p ranged between 0.03 and 0.21 mm and 0.07 and 0.20 mm respectively. the relative molecular weights of the native enzyme were 229,000 for one donor-transformant pair (s. sanguis and s. gordonii), 107,000 for the other pair (s. mitis and s. gordonii) and 129,000 for s. mutans. the molecular weights of the s6pdh subunits  ranged from 26,000 to 28,000. the ph optima (greater than 8.5) and the amino acid composition (15 amino acids examined) were similar for the s6pdh from the different strains. however, the chromatographic and electrophoretic patterns as well as the km values for nad and s6p were the same only between the s6pdhs from  the strains within each donor-transformant pair. purified s6pdh from s. mutans also exhibited low mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase activity. sorbitol-grown decryptified cells of all the strains phosphorylated sorbitol in the presence of  phosphoenolpyruvate but not in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (atp). atp-mediated phosphorylation of glucose was observed with the same strains when grown on glucose. no evidence for a non-phosphotransferase transport system was found for sorbitol in any of the strains.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [morphologic and biochemical characteristics of viridans streptococci isolated from dental plaque].
AB  == the purposes of this study were to give the characteristics of viridans streptococci isolated from dental plaque, and the relationships with dental caries. we stained 69 patients' teeth on supragingival plaques (plaque index = 1) with the pfiffer's reagent or fd&c red#28 dye, then isolated 80 strains of oral streptococci from 69 patients. cultures were grown in tsb, ms, and msb media. a total of 80 fresh-isolated plaque streptococci, including strains of s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. mitis, and s. mutans were identified on the basis of morphologic, dark field, sem, and biochemical characteristics. all of the oral plaque streptococci were to be found in significant percentages in dental plaque. patients who had caries harboured s. mutans more often (37/40) than patients without caries (7/29). s. mutans comprised the greatest percentage (37/69) of microorganisms encountered in caries' plaque, and there was an association between high counts of s. mutans and the presence of dental caries. cultural and  biochemical methods were used for the isolation and identification of the different species of s. mutans. the result indicated that biotype i were the most predominant species (50%) in dental plaque. thus, it is possible to isolate, screen and identify unknown strains through the morphologic, darkfield, sem, and  biochemical characteristics of viridans streptococci isolated from human dental plaque. by means of the present methods for identification, we hold considerable  promises for contributing to the prevention and diagnosis of dental diseases.

TI  == inhibition of microbial adherence and growth by various glass ionomers in vitro.
AB  == this study measured the in vitro inhibition of growth and adherence of five oral  bacteria by glass-ionomer materials. disks were prepared from two cavity liners and four restorative class materials, by use of teflon plates with circular wells, five mm wide and two mm deep. the bacterial species tested included: a. viscosus, s. mitis, s. mutans, l. casei, and s. sanguis. growth inhibition studies were performed by the spreading of 0.1 ml of standardized inocula over agar plates produced with selective media, followed by the direct application of  glass-ionomer disks onto the agar. on other plates, disks were placed onto uninoculated agars for 48 h, followed by bacterial inoculation. all agar plates were incubated under optimal growth conditions for each bacterial species. the four restorative materials were also placed aseptically into sterilized bovine incisors and placed into sucrose containing broth media, inoculated with s. mutans for three days. adhering materials were disclosed and scored. an ion-exchange electrode was used to measure fluoride release over a seven-day period for all six glass ionomers. the two cavity liners and two of the restorative materials produced the largest growth inhibition zones by direct contact. no growth inhibition occurred when the specimens were allowed to come into contact with the agars prior to inoculation. all four restorative materials  reduced bacterial accumulations on enamel surfaces by over 80%. elevations in short-term fluoride release levels were positively correlated with growth inhibition.

AB  == laboratory "type" strains of oral streptococci were screened for their ability to grow on mitis-salivarius agar (msa) in the presence of increasing concentrations  of either na+ or k+ up to 500 mmol/l. strains were generally better able to withstand increasing concentrations of na+ than k+, although low numbers of colony-forming units (cfus) were seen with the highest concentration of either cation. two strains of streptococcus mutans, ingbritt 162 and ingbritt 175, behaved differently when the concentration of cation was increased from 50 to 200 mmol/l; the latter showed a marked increase in the number of cfus when the na+ concentration was increased from 50 to 200 mmol/l, whereas there was a decrease with strain ingbritt 162. strains of oral streptococci from the saliva of adults  and children were isolated on modified msa containing known concentrations of na+ and k+ and further examined if they showed "mutans-like" colony morphology. the number of cfus generally dropped as the concentration of na+ or k+ was increased  from 200 to 350 or 500 mmol/l. greater numbers of streptococci were tolerant to na+ than to k+. half of the isolates were members of the streptococcus sanguis group (ssg), either streptococcus mitis or s. sanguis ii, and these were more tolerant to high concentrations of na+ or k+ than other isolates that were identified as streptococcus morbillorum, streptococcus acidominimus, and streptococcus milleri.

AB  == the prevalence of dental caries and periodontal treatment needs in an institutionalized population with down syndrome was examined and the relationship between caries prevalence, salivary ph, and salivary levels of streptococcus mutans was studied. thirty-two children with down syndrome, aged 8 to 13, were compared with two control groups of similar age ranges: healthy children and non-down mentally retarded (mr) children living in the same institution as the down syndrome population. the gender ratio mixtures in each group also matched the study sample. caries experience as indicated by decayed, missing, and filled  surfaces (dmf-s) showed significantly lower mean scores for the down syndrome group compared with both control groups. a similar pattern was found when evaluating the mean numbers of decayed surfaces. streptococcus mutans counts, expressed as number of colony-forming units on mitis salivarius agar plates among the down syndrome group, were the lowest, although not statistically significant  compared with the counts of the healthy children. both groups had bacterial counts which were significantly lower than those of the mr group. significant differences between the two institutionalized groups and the healthy group were recorded for the salivary ph levels. the periodontal treatment needs as evaluated by the community periodontal index of treatment needs showed significant difference between the mr group versus both the healthy population and the down syndrome group. on the whole, 84% of the down syndrome children were cariesfree.

AB  == pathogenesis of nutritionally variant streptococcal (nvs) endocarditis initiates  with bacterial attachment to and colonization of the damaged heart valve surface. underlying extracellular matrix (ecm) exposed to the environment during damage to cardiac endothelium provides additional receptors that could be involved in bacterial adherence. the ability of nvs and endocarditis-associated streptococci  to bind ecm was investigated by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system that incorporated ecm secreted by baby hamster kidney and human umbilical vein endothelial cells in culture. streptococcus defectivus, the major species isolated from nvs endocarditis cases, bound ecm of fibroblasts and endothelial cells, indicating that the ecm molecule involved in the binding was a common constituent of diverse matrices. the specific binding of s. defectivus to ecm was demonstrated by saturation binding and specific antibody inhibition studies. of the 15 s. defectivus strains analyzed, 13 bound ecm, whereas streptococcus adjacens and nvs serotype iii strains were unable to bind the matrix. this selective binding suggested that s. defectivus binds to heart valves through a mechanism different from those of other nvs in subacute bacterial endocarditis. a survey of non-nvs streptococcal endocarditis isolates demonstrated that s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguis, and s. faecalis also bound ecm, whereas other viridans species were unable to bind the matrix.

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine on proteolytic and glycosidic enzyme activities of dental plaque bacteria.

TI  == sorbitol transport and metabolism by oral streptococci.
AB  == sorbitol transport by oral streptococci was mediated by a phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (pts). the transition of s. sanguis 160 from continuous growth on limiting glucose to limiting sorbitol resulted in induction of eiisor of the sorbitol-pts, as well as sorbitol-6-p dehydrogenase which converts sorbitol-6-p to fructose-6-p. sorbitol transport activity required the presence of a soluble sorbitol-specific component of the pts, tentatively identified as an enzyme iii for sorbitol (iiisor). in addition, the results indicated that sorbitol transport can be mediated by the ellglc, particularly in the presence of the sorbitol-specific component. s. sanguis 160 utilized sorbitol in a manner different from that reported for s mutans. growth on glucose by s. sanguis 160 was inhibited by the presence of sorbitol in the growth medium and sorbitol was utilized in the presence of glucose. in addition, pulses of glucose added to cultures growing on sorbitol resulted in expulsion of sorbitol from the cell. sorbitol was shown to interfere with glucose metabolism by s. sanguis 160 by inhibiting glucose transport by sorbitol-limited cells, but not by glucose-limited cells, and by inhibiting glycolytic activity with glucose as the  substrate. furthermore, sorbitol was an effective repressor of the glucose-pts, exhibiting negative regulation over synthesis of both eiiglc and a soluble component of the glucose-pts, presumably iiiglc. oral streptococci metabolize sorbitol to large amounts of formate and ethanol in addition to smaller amounts of lactate and acetate. the metabolism of sorbitol by s. sanguis and s. gordonii  was less sensitive to oxygen than that by s. mutans and s. mitis.

TI  == oxygen and the sugar metabolism in oral streptococci.
AB  == streptococci have several ways of adapting themselves to the constantly changing  environment of the human oral cavity. this paper discusses the adaptation of sugar metabolism to variations in oxygen levels. in all streptococci the embden-meyerhof pathway of glycolysis works under aerobic as well as anaerobic conditions, but pyruvate is converted into different metabolic end products depending on the oxygen levels. under anaerobic conditions all streptococci form  formate, acetate, and ethanol by a pyruvate formate-lyase pathway. if sugar is in excess, they also form lactate using a lactate dehydrogenase. under aerobic conditions pyruvate formate-lyase is inactivated. this enzyme is then replaced by a pyruvate oxidase in some streptococci and by a pyruvate dehydrogenase in others. the characteristics of these enzymes help streptococci like s. sanguis, s. oralis, s. gordonii, and s. mitis to compete successfully with other bacteria  in those sites of the oral cavity that are freely exposed to saliva, while mutans streptococci have to colonize anaerobic sites such as those in-between the teeth  and in the occlusal fissures of the teeth.

TI  == secretory iga adsorption and oral streptococcal adhesion to human enamel and artificial solid substrata with various surface free energies.
AB  == in this paper, secretory iga adsorption from a single component siga solution and from human whole saliva onto human enamel and artificial solid substrata with various surface free energies was studied as a function of time. elisa indicated  that screening or displacement of adsorbed siga by other salivary proteins occurred only on low surface free energy substrata, not on high surface free energy substrata such as enamel. in addition, the adhesion of three oral streptococcal strains (streptococcus mitis bms, s. sanguis 12, and s. mutans ns), also having widely different surface free energies, to siga-coated surfaces was studied. the adhesion of all three streptococcal strains was significantly reduced in the presence of a siga coating. however, ranking the adhesion data with respect to the various substrata revealed a similar order to that in the case of uncoated substrata, indicating that substratum properties were at least partly transferred by the adsorbed protein film to the interface with adhering micro-organisms. for s. sanguis 12 and s. mitis bms, adhesion decreased proportionally with the amounts of siga detected by elisa, but for s. mutans ns such relations with the amounts of siga detected on the protein-coated substrata  were not found. thus, for s. mutans ns a specific antibody effect seems to exist  in addition to a non-specific protein effect like that observed for s. sanguis 12 and s. mitis bms.

AB  == plaque from the root surfaces of 165 subjects (mean age 65.5 years, 22-26 teeth/subject) was analysed for specific bacteria. five subject groups were defined: a (dmfs 16.4), b (dmfs 55.9), c1 (dmfs 55.6), c2 (dmfs 57.0) and c3 (dmfs 48.1). groups c1 and c2 had unrestored root surface lesions; group a, b and c3 were free of unrestored root caries and differed in their coronal caries experience. streptococcus mutans was isolated more frequently from the root lesions in groups c1 and c2 than from intact root surfaces in group a. streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis 1 and streptococcus sanguis were isolated more frequently from group a. the percentage contribution that s. mutans made to plaque from lesions in groups c1 and c2 was higher than that from plaque  in group a and actinomyces viscosus serovar 2 contributed more to plaque in group c1 than in samples from group a. the percentage counts of lactobacillus in plaque from lesions in groups c1 and c2 were higher than those from intact roots in groups a, b, and c3. subjects were also grouped on the presence of lactobacillus  and s. mutans in plaque samples. samples with both organisms (n = 17) showed significantly higher isolation frequencies of specific strains of s. mitis 1 and  also a. viscosus serovar 2 compared with samples of plaque containing s. mutans or lactobacillus. actinomyces naeslundii serovar 1 was not isolated from samples  containing both s. mutans and lactobacillus. the results confirm an association of s. mutans and lactobacillus with root surface lesions and suggest a relationship between lesions and a. viscosus serovar 2.

TI  == ability to bind salivary alpha-amylase discriminates certain viridans group streptococcal species.
AB  == a collection of 144 viridans group streptococcal strains recently characterized as part of a taxonomic study was examined for the ability to bind salivary alpha-amylase. this property was found in most strains of streptococcus gordonii  and streptococcus mitis and in occasional strains of streptococcus anginosus and  streptococcus salivarius. in contrast, all strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus vestibularis, and streptococcus mutans lacked alpha-amylase-binding capacity. a rapid and easy assay described in this paper may be an important supplementary test for identification of oral streptococci.

TI  == adherence of mutans streptococci to other oral bacteria.
AB  == adherence of mutans streptococci to strains of actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane was measured. strains of streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, and s. rattus bound in a lactose-independent manner to a variety of the actinomyces and  streptococci. most of these reactions could proceed in the presence of whole saliva although adherence of s. rattus bht to the streptococci was inhibited by salivary molecules. in contrast, adherence of s. mutans 10449 and kpsk2 to a. viscosus, s. sanguis, and s. mitis was enhanced by salivary molecules. s. mutans  kpsk2, s. sobrinus omz 176, and s. rattus fa-1 binding to a. viscosus nc3 and s.  sanguis g9b exhibited saturation kinetics. adherence to a. viscosus nc3 was of a  higher avidity than adherence to s. sanguis g9b. attachment of s. mutans kpsk2 to s. sanguis g9b and of s. mutans omz 176 to a. viscosus nc3 and s. sanguis g9b was inhibited by heat treatment of the mutans streptococci. attachment of s. mutans kpsk2 to a. viscosus nc3 and of s. rattus fa-1 to a. viscosus nc3 and s. sanguis  g9b was unaffected by heat. these observations suggest that the mutans streptococci can adhere to a variety of early plaque bacteria by several distinct mechanisms. such interactions may be important in the colonization of tooth surfaces by the mutans streptococci.

TI  == microflora associated with experimental root surface caries in humans.
AB  == this study describes the microflora from actively progressing root surface caries lesions, in which mineral loss had been determined by quantitative microradiography. the caries lesions were produced experimentally in root surface specimens from human molars inserted in lower partial dentures carried for 3 months by six elderly individuals. a total of 780 bacterial isolates were identified from 13 plaque samples, collected with a punch technique, and six dentin samples. the composition of the microflora showed distinct individual differences. the microflora from plaque samples associated with the highest mineral loss was dominated by either actinomyces viscosus or a combination of mutans streptococci (serotypes c, d, and f) and lactobacillus species (l. casei and l. brevis). plaque from root surfaces with less pronounced mineral loss harbored a more complex microflora comprising gram-positive rods, mutans streptococci, streptococcus mitis biovar 1, veillonella spp., gram-negative rods, and low numbers of lactobacilli. in the latter samples, individual variations in  the proportions of mutans streptococci (serotypes c, d, and g), actinomyces species (a. viscosus and a. naeslundii), and veillonella parvula biotypes were observed. these findings suggest that certain species or combinations of species  are more cariogenic than others and that dominance of single acidogenic species in particular is conducive to high caries activity.

TI  == sialidase activity of the "streptococcus milleri group" and other viridans group  streptococci.
AB  == viridans group streptococci were examined for the production of sialidase (neuraminidase) activity, using the fluorescent substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-d-n-acetylneuraminic acid in a simple and rapid (15-min) assay. sialidase was produced by all strains of streptococcus oralis and s. intermedius and by a majority of s. mitis strains. s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s.  gordonii, s. sanguis, s. vestibularis, s. salivarius, s. anginosus, s. constellatus, "s. parasanguis," and the "tufted fibril group" were uniformly negative. sialidase production may be a useful characteristic to assist in the identification of viridans group streptococci.

TI  == effect of tif4 solutions on bacterial growth in vitro and on tooth surfaces.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to assess the antimicrobial effect of tif4 as compared with equimolar solutions of naf, apf, and snf2 and to evaluate the effect, if any, on bacterial growth on topically treated tooth surfaces. in an in vitro study, paper discs impregnated with 20 microliters of equimolar solutions of snf2, naf, apf, and tif4 were placed on blood agar plates seeded with streptococcus mutans and bacteroides gingivalis. sterile saline was used as control. similar growth inhibition zones were found for all fluorides. in the second part of the study six volunteers carried intraoral appliances containing enamel and root surface specimens treated with 1% tif4 and untreated specimens for 18 h. scanning electron microscopic examination of the experimental tooth surfaces showed great variation in bacterial growth between subjects, but no systematic difference between fluoride-treated and untreated specimens. bacteria  from test and control specimens were grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions on blood agar and on mitis salivarius agar. colony-forming unit counts showed great interindividual variations, but no differences could be observed between treated and untreated enamel or root surfaces. thus, the hypothesis that the presence of a ti-rich coating may influence bacterial colonization on tif4-treated tooth surfaces could not be substantiated.

TI  == microbiology of root surface caries in humans.
AB  == studies on the microbiology of root surface caries between 1970 and 1975 placed emphasis on gram-positive pleomorphic filamentous rods, particularly actinomyces  viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii. both of these species had been shown to produce root surface caries in experimental animals. since this time, studies have placed more emphasis on streptococcus mutans, and s. mutans and lactobacillus are significant in prediction of root surface caries risk in patients. subsequent studies confirmed an association between s. mutans and 'soft' or 'initial' root lesions. thus, it is important when determining the microflora of root surface lesions to make careful characterization of the state  of the lesion. a second important aspect of the analysis of bacterial communities associated with root surface caries is better definition of the organisms. most studies have concentrated on 'target organisms' s. mutans, s. sanguis, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii, lactobacillus, and veillonella. however, it has been known for 17 years that the actinomyces associated with the lesions may be variants of a. viscosus and a. naeslundii. such strains (intermediate strains) have been described in taxonomic studies of actinomyces, yet little is known of the differences in physiology of these strains or their relationship to root surface caries. a similar situation exists with oral streptococcus where new taxonomic divisions are being proposed. recognition of the potential diversity within the 'target' genera of root surface caries could yield valuable data. recent studies suggest that this is so, since samples from root surface lesions which contain s. mutans and lactobacillus show a high isolation of s. mitis 1 and no isolations of a. naeslundii. careful definition of the lesions of root surface caries and the flora will allow analysis to relate a specific bacterial community to the state fo the lesion and assist in monitoring the control of the lesion through fluoride and antibacterials.

TI  == utilization of mucin by oral streptococcus species.
AB  == the ability of oral streptococcus strains to utilize oligosaccharide chains in mucin as a source of carbohydrate was studied in batch cultures. pig gastric mucin, as a substitute of human salivary mucin, was added to chemically defined medium containing no other carbohydrates. strains of s. mitior attained the highest cell density, while mutans streptococci: s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. rattus, grew very little in the medium with mucin. s. mitis, s. sanguis, and s. milleri in decreasing order, showed intermediate growth. mucin breakdown as measured by sugar analyses indicated that oligosaccharide chains were only partially degraded. every strain produced one or more exoglycosidases potentially involved in hydrolysis of oligosaccharide. the enzyme activities occurred mainly  associated with the cells, and very little activity was found in the culture fluids. the relationships between glycosidase activities and growth, or mucin degradation were not always clear.

TI  == effect of chlorhexidine-sodium fluoride gel applied by tray or by toothbrush on salivary mutans streptococci.
AB  == a chlorhexidine (1%)-sodium fluoride (0.2%) gel applied using a dental tray six times during two consecutive days significantly decreased salivary levels of mutans streptococci but had only a slight effect on salivary levels of lactobacilli. the same gel used as a dentifrice for one week (twice a day) also significantly reduced salivary levels of mutans streptococci. however, this treatment was somewhat less effective than that using trays, on the basis of the  ratio of mutans streptococci to total aerobes. with both treatments baseline salivary levels of mutans streptococci were re-attained after 70 days. one day after the gel treatment, mutans streptococci were unable to adhere to plastic strips (dentocult sm strip mutans) but detectable growth was found on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. this suggests that not only are numbers of mutans streptococci reduced after chlorhexidine-sodium fluoride gel treatment but also mutans streptococci adherence.

TI  == comparison of the initial streptococcal microflora on dental enamel in caries-active and in caries-inactive individuals.
AB  == this study compared the initial (4 h) microflora on enamel in 7 caries-active and in 7 caries-inactive adolescents. in both groups the microflora was dominated by  streptococci which comprised 61 and 78% (median values) of the total viable counts in caries-active and caries-inactive individuals, respectively (p less than 0.01). identification of a total of 700 streptococcal isolates according to  a recently revised classification showed that the predominant streptococci belonged to the species streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis biovar 1, and streptococcus sanguis. early plaque from caries-inactive individuals differed from that of caries-active individuals by significantly higher proportions of s.  sanguis (p less than 0.05) and iga1 protease producing streptococci (p less than  0.05). in caries-active individuals, there was a tendency to elevated levels of s. mitis biovar 1 (p less than 0.10). in addition, caries-active individuals were colonized by significantly higher numbers of mutans streptococci on the enamel surfaces (p less than 0.01). however, in both groups streptococcus mutans (serotype c) comprised less than or equal to 2% of the early streptococcal flora. streptococcus gordonii, s. mitis biovar 2, and streptococcus salivarius were present in low proportions and did not show differences in distribution that could be related to caries activity. the observed differences in the composition  of the early streptococcal microflora may be a factor that governs the eventual cariogenic potential of dental plaque.

TI  == characterization of salivary alpha-amylase binding to streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to identify the major salivary components which interact with oral bacteria and to determine the mechanism(s) responsible for their binding to the bacterial surface. strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, and actinomyces viscosus were incubated for 2 h in freshly collected human submandibular-sublingual saliva (hsmsl) or parotid saliva (hps), and bound salivary components were eluted with 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate. by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western transfer, alpha-amylase (ec 3.2.1.1) was the prominent salivary component eluted from s. sanguis. studies with 125i-labeled hsmsl or 125i-labeled hps also demonstrated a component with an electrophoretic mobility identical to that of alpha-amylase which bound to s. sanguis. purified alpha-amylase from human parotid saliva was radiolabeled and found to bind to strains of s. sanguis genotypes 1 and 3 and s. mitis genotype 2, but not to strains of other species of oral bacteria. binding of [125i]alpha-amylase to streptococci was saturable, calcium independent, and inhibitable by excess unlabeled alpha-amylases from a variety of sources, but not by secretory immunoglobulin a and the proline-rich glycoprotein from hps. reduced and alkylated alpha-amylase lost enzymatic and bacterial binding activities. binding  was inhibited by incubation with maltotriose, maltooligosaccharides, limit dextrins, and starch.

TI  == classification and identification of the viridans streptococci.
AB  == this review traces the history of the human, nonhemolytic, or viridans, streptococci and describes improvements in their taxonomy wrought by study of their biochemical profiles and analysis of their nucleic acids. the goal was to define species on the basis of genetic relationships and to describe these species by their phenotypic characteristics so that they can be easily identified. this method has resulted in the division of some species. streptococcus mutans has been divided into four species, two of which are common  in humans. three more mutans group species are indigenous to animals. conversely, s. constellatus, s. intermedius, and "s. milleri" have been combined under s. anginosus. s. mitis (or "s. mitior") can be well-defined and includes s. sanguis  ii. there is genetic heterogeneity within s. sanguis, but the species is usually  easy to identify. there is also some heterogeneity in s. bovis, but most human isolates are genetically related. discussions of the taxonomy of these species are accompanied by descriptions of the characteristics by which these streptococci can be identified. among these species are potential pathogens which should be suspected in cases of endocarditis and purulent infections of liver, brain, and other tissues.

TI  == molecular surface characterization of oral streptococci by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
AB  == in order to characterize the molecular composition of oral streptococci, infrared transmission spectroscopy on freeze-dried cells dissolved in kbr was used. all infrared spectra show similar absorption bands for the strains studied with the most important absorption bands located at 2930 cm-1 (ch), 1653 cm-1 (ami), 1541  cm-1 (amii) and two bands at 1236 cm-1 and 1082 cm-1, which were assigned to phosphate and sugar groups. however, calculation of absorption band ratios normalized with respect to the integrated intensity of the ch stretching region around 2930 cm-1, show significant differences between the strains. both streptococcus mitis strains possess high ami/ch and amii/ch absorption band ratios compared to the other strains. streptococcus salivarius hbc12, a mutant strain devoid of all proteinaceous surface appendages, shows significantly lower  ami/ch and amii/ch band ratios with respect to its parent strain s. salivarius hb. two positive relationships could be established both between the amii/ch absorption band ratio and the n/c elemental surface concentration ratio of the strains previously, determined from x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps) and also between ami/ch and the fraction of carbon atoms at the surface involved in amide bonds, determined by xps as well. from this comparison, it is concluded that transmission infrared spectroscopy can be employed as a technique to study the molecular surface composition of freeze-dried microorganisms.

TI  == the effects of pellicle formation on streptococcal adhesion to human enamel and artificial substrata with various surface free-energies.
AB  == the influence of a pellicle on streptococcal adhesion was studied. a "ripened" two-hour salivary pellicle and an "early" five-minute salivary pellicle were formed on human enamel and artificial solid substrata with varying surface free-energies. three strains of oral streptococci, also with widely different surface free-energies, were used for adhesion studies. pellicle formation and streptococcal adhesion took place at a constant shear rate of 21 s-1. adhesion of s. mitis bms to bare and pellicle-covered enamel was low and not significantly affected by the presence of a pellicle (0.7 x 10(6) and 0.6 x 10(6) cells.cm-2, resp.), whereas the numbers of s. sanguis 12 and s. mutans ns adhering to bare enamel (4.2 x 10(6) cells.cm-2 and 13.8 x 10(6) cells, cm-2, resp) were significantly reduced by the presence of a pellicle. this reduction was almost complete after only five minutes of salivary protein adsorption (1.9 x 10(-6) and 1.1 x 10(6) cells.cm-2 for s. sanguis and s. mutans, resp.) but further reduced for s. sanguis adhering to a ripened pellicle (0.7 x 10(6) cells.cm-2). the numbers of streptococci adhering at equilibrium to bare enamel could be fitted to a thermodynamically based model, which was previously described for bacterial adhesion to homogenous artificial substrata. streptococcal adhesion to artificial substrata exposed to saliva was low, and the differences among uncoated materials were markedly reduced even after only five minutes' exposure to saliva.

TI  == zeta potential and the adhesion of oral streptococci to polymethylmethacrylate.
AB  == adhesion of candida albicans to the acrylic fitting surface of dentures can lead  to the development of denture induced stomatitis and is suggested to be preceeded by the adhesion of indegeneous oral bacteria. bacterial adhesion can be considered as a result of attractive van der waals and repulsive electrostatic forces. in this paper we investigate the role of electrostatic interactions in the adhesion of oral streptococci to polymethylmethacrylate (pmma), the most commonly employed denture-base material. zeta potentials of the bacterial strains as well as of pmma fillings were reduced by increasing the ionic strength in the  buffer suspension, causing an elevated number of adhering s. mitis, s. sanguis and s. mutans. as streptococcal adhesion is suggested to be a prerequisite for the subsequent adhesion of candida albicans, the use of more negatively charged denture-base materials can be recommended in order to prevent streptococcal adhesion and therewith adhesion of candidae, and the occurrence of denture-induced stomatitis.

TI  == a comparison between the elemental surface compositions and electrokinetic properties of oral streptococci with and without adsorbed salivary constituents.
AB  == in order to characterize the functional cell surface, isoelectric points and elemental surface concentration, the ratios of nitrogen, oxygen and phosphorus to carbon of saliva-coated strains were determined by ph-dependent zeta potential measurements and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and compared with those of uncoated strains. the measurements of potential were carried out on completely hydrated cells, whereas the spectroscopy was on freeze-dried micro-organisms. the small increase in the nitrogen:carbon surface concentration ratio of saliva-coated streptococci in comparison to uncoated strains varied from 0.001 (streptococcus mitis ba) to 0.029 (streptococcus sanguis ch3) and was concurrent  with an increase of the isoelectric point, ranging from 0.0 to 0.9. increases in  the oxygen:carbon ratio ranged from 0.006 (strep. mitis ba) to 0.041 (streptococcus mutans ns), whereas the phosphorus:carbon surface concentration ratio was unchanged after saliva treatment. despite the fact that isoelectric and compositional measurements were made in different states of surface hydration, a  decrease in the nitrogen:carbon ratio accompanied by an increase in oxygen:carbon ratio, was related to a decrease of the isoelectric point of the saliva-coated strains, and so analogous with previous observations for uncoated strains. although there were changes in the physico-chemical properties of the strains upon saliva coating, all more or less kept their own surface identity despite adsorption of salivary constituents, possibly indicating some capacity to protect their own physico-chemical identity.

AB  == the production of inhibitory substances was sought by deferred antagonism. streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis produced bactericidal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, but no detectable bacteriocin.  actinomycetes and neisseria pharyngis were particularly susceptible to the lethal action of hydrogen peroxide. streptococcus milleri produced bactericidal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocin-like substances. s. oralis strains were inhibited by the bacteriocin-like products of strains of streptococcus bovis, streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus salivarius. inhibition was due neither to complete bacteriophage nor to fermentation end-products. extracellular polysaccharides formed during growth could not protect sensitive strains from the effect of hydrogen peroxide or bacteriocin-like substances.

TI  == in-vitro adherence of oral streptococci in the presence of sucrose and its relationship to cariogenicity in the rat.
AB  == streptococcus sanguis i gave a significantly greater percentage coverage (cell-pellicle attachment) of saliva-coated glass in the presence of sucrose than did strep. sanguis ii (p less than 0.025), and both these gave greater percentage coverages than the other species tested, between which no significant differences were noted. there was a large number of significant differences in clump size (cell-cell attachment) between species-pairs. among the mutans streptococci, there were significant differences in the percentage coverage between streptococcus rattus/streptococcus mutans (p less than 0.05) and strep. rattus/streptococcus sobrinus (p less than 0.01), and in clump size between all species-pairs with the exception of streptococcus cricetus or strep. sobrinus and strep. mutans. the rank order of species in relation to fissure caries was mutans streptococci greater than streptococcus salivarius greater than streptococcus milleri greater than strep. sanguis greater than streptococcus faecalis greater than streptococcus mitis greater than streptococcus lactis. there was a significant correlation between percentage coverage in vitro and fissure caries in vivo for strains of strep. sanguis (p less than 0.05) and pooled strains of strep. mitis and strep. sanguis (p less than 0.01). on comparing data for adherence in the presence or the absence of sucrose, the sugar had no effect on the percentage coverage of the seven species tested, but significantly increased  the clump size of the mutans streptococci (p less than 0.01) and strep. sanguis (p less than 0.05).

TI  == analysis of heart-reactive antibodies induced in rabbits by immunization with streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the induction of antibodies that react with human heart muscle in rabbits immunized with streptococcus mutans and related organisms has been investigated in order to re-examine the reported antigenic cross-reactivity between the major  cell wall protein antigen i/ii of s. mutans and heart tissue. serum from 2 of 8 rabbits hyperimmunized with whole cells of s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. rattus, or  s. mitis, assayed by immunofluorescence and radioimmunoassay, revealed antibodies reactive with sarcolemma that could be attributed to immunization. antisera raised against several crude and purified antigens of s. mutans did not reveal heart-reactive antibodies, that could be attributed to antigenic similarity between heart and these antigens. an assay designed to detect antibodies that could simultaneously bind to both heart and antigen i/ii of s. mutans failed to reveal cross-reactivity due to this antigen, although antibodies separately expressing these binding activities were demonstrable. igm rheumatoid factor was  elevated in several antisera to s. mutans, and could have contributed to some previous observations ascribed to antigenic cross-reactivity between s. mutans and human heart muscle.

TI  == a simplified diagnostic system for cultural detection and enumeration of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == a simple dip-slide test (cariescreen sm) based on msb selective agar was devised  for detection and quantitation of streptococcus mutans in oral samples. for this  test, a bacitracin tablet is dissolved in a vial containing buffered saline diluent. paraffin-stimulated saliva is collected in this diluent vial. a dip slide which incorporates a modified msb agar (minus bacitracin) is immersed briefly in the diluted saliva. after addition of a co2-generating tablet, the screw-cap dip slide is closed tightly in the vial and incubated for two days at 37 degrees c and one day at room temperature. s. mutans populations in saliva are estimated by comparison with a colony density chart. growth of reference strains  of s. mutans was equivalent on cariescreen sm dip slides and on msb agar plates.  reference strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus milleri did not grow on cariescreen sm dip slides. aliquots of saliva from 50 schoolchildren and 51 adults were tested by the dip-slide method and by conventional plating methods in msb agar. very good correlation (0.93) between the two methods was obtained. this simplified s. mutans detection system is suitable for use by clinical personnel in dental clinics or other non-laboratory settings for identification of subjects potentially at risk for caries.

TI  == [bacteriological investigation of the cariogenic effects of sugar alcohols and sucrose].
AB  == considerable evidence indicates that the disaccharide, sucrose is probably the major dietary factor in dental caries formation and much subsequent research has  gone into the search for another sweetener to replace sucrose. currently, there is much interest in the development of new sweeteners and the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols. the present study aimed to examine the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols (xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol) and sucrose on growth  pattern and acid production of s. mutans, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. faecalis, s. viridans, l. casei and l. acidophilus in vitro by using photo electrical colorimeter and ph meter. in conclusion the results in this study showed that out of sugar alcohols, xylitol is the only compound which, depending  on its concentration, significantly did not affect the growth and acid production of all tested micro organisms.

TI  == an improved medium for isolation of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == a medium based upon tryptone, yeast extract, cystine (tyc) agar and incorporating bacitracin and sucrose has been evaluated for selective isolation of streptococcus mutans. the effect of varying the concentrations of sucrose and bacitracin on the recovery of two standard strains was investigated. growth of s. mutans nctc 10449 was significantly inhibited by increasing concentrations of sucrose but was not affected by bacitracin; the reverse was seen with s. sobrinus strain 6715. the best compromise between recovery of the streptococci and growth  of other organisms was obtained with a final sucrose concentration of 20% and bacitracin 0.2 units/ml. in comparison with three other selective media, this medium gave the highest recovery rate of standard strains, indicating that it is  superior to mitis-salivarius bacitracin (msb) agar for the recovery of s. mutans  from saliva.

AB  == the role of extracellular matrix material (emm) synthesized from sucrose (s) by streptococcus mutans ib-1600 in altering the demineralizing potential of artificial plaque was evaluated with an intraoral enamel demineralization test (iedt). the artificial plaque samples were prepared from cells cultivated in todd-hewitt broth (thb) supplemented with various s concentrations and by mixing  thb-grown cells with increasing proportions of emm (heat-killed thb + 2% s-cultivated cells). the samples were also evaluated for cell density (dna content) and acidogenicity in vitro (ph-stat), as well as for in situ ph changes  during a 45-minute intra-oral test following a 10% glucose rinse. an increase in  the proportion of emm relative to cell density was associated with an increase in enamel demineralization. this trend reversed when the ratio of cells to emm was less than 1:19. experiments involving strains of s. mitis, s. sanguis, and s. salivarius suggested a similar effect of emm. the intra-oral ph data suggest that the presence of emm may enhance demineralization by altering diffusion properties of plaque.

TI  == comparative recovery of streptococcus mutans on five isolation media, including a new simple selective medium.
AB  == for the isolation of streptococcus mutans, several selective media have been developed, of which mitis-salivarius sucrose bacitracin agar (msb) is the most widely used (gold et al., 1973). recently, the trypticase yeast-extract cystine agar medium (tyc, de stoppelaar et al., 1967) was modified into a selective medium for s. mutans, called trypticase yeast-extract cystine sucrose bacitracin  (tycsb, van palenstein helderman et al., 1983). the aim of this study was to compare the recovery of s. mutans from clinical samples on mitis-salivarius agar  (ms), msb, tyc, and tycsb. further, a new simple selective medium for s. mutans was introduced. this medium, called tsy20b, was supposed to have the same qualities as tycsb, but its preparation is less laborious. one hundred eighty-five plaque and saliva samples from 37 subjects were plated on ms, msb, tyc, and tycsb, and 285 samples from 23 subjects were plated on tycsb and tsy20b. all plates were incubated at 37 degrees c in a 91% n2, 5% co2, 4% h2 atmosphere for five days. the s. mutans counts on tyc and tycsb were significantly higher than on ms or msb by almost a factor of 10. seventy-seven percent of the samples  gave higher s. mutans counts on tycsb than on msb. especially, samples with high  s. mutans d/g numbers gave lower s. mutans counts on msb. these data clearly indicate that msb agar is inhibitory for s. mutans and should not be used. an additional advantage of tycsb over msb agar is the possibility of distinguishing  s. mutans serotypes d/g from other serotypes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == molecular cloning and characterization of scrb, the structural gene for the streptococcus mutans phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sucrose phosphotransferase system sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase.
AB  == a dna fragment encoding the sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase component of the streptococcus mutans phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sucrose phosphotransferase system has been recovered from a plasmid-based genomic library of strain gs5. the locus, designated scrb, was found to reside within a 2.9-kilobase-pair restriction fragment present on the chimeric molecule pva1343 (7.3 kilobase pairs). minicell analysis of pva1343-directed translation products revealed that  the scrb product synthesized in escherichia coli v1343 was a single peptide of mr 57,000. this polypeptide was reactive with antiserum prepared against s. mutans intracellular invertase, which has been previously shown to have an mr of 43,000  to 48,000. the basis of this difference in mr was not established but may represent a posttranslational proteolytic event which occurred in s. mutans but not in recombinant v1343. sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase purified to homogeneity from v1343 exhibited michaelis constants of 180 mm for sucrose and 0.08 mm for sucrose-6-phosphate. deletion analysis of pva1343 facilitated the assignment of a coding region for the hydrolase within the insert, as well as an orientation for  the transcription of scrb. scrb-defective strains of s. mutans constructed by additive integration of an insertionally inactivated scrb locus exhibited the sucrose sensitivity characteristic of this mutant class. similar loci were detected by dna-dna hybridization in additional strains of s. mutans and two strains of streptococcus cricetus, but not in single strain representatives of s. rattus, s. sobrinus, s. sanguis i and ii, s. salivarius, or s. mitis.

TI  == isolation and characterization of a 60-kilodalton salivary glycoprotein with agglutinating activity against strains of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == a bacterial agglutinin specific for strains of streptococcus mutans was isolated  from human saliva. physiochemical analyses showed the agglutinin to be a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 60,000. the agglutinin aggregated four of the eight strains of streptococcus mutans tested but did not aggregate the strains of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis tested. chemical modification of carbohydrate moieties of the agglutinin with sodium metaperiodate had no effect on aggregation, whereas modification of the polypeptide portion with trypsin abolished aggregating activity. a set of five murine hybridoma antibodies was employed to further analyze the agglutinin.  two carbohydrate-specific antibodies, directed against d-mannose and n-acetylgalactosamine moieties, respectively, failed to block agglutinin- or whole saliva-mediated aggregation of s. mutans cells. in contrast, two antibodies directed against pronase-sensitive antigenic sites blocked both agglutinin- and saliva-mediated aggregation of s. mutans cells. western blot analysis with the agglutinin-specific hybridoma antibodies demonstrated the agglutinin in whole saliva and in artificial tooth pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite beads incubated with saliva. these results suggest that a 60-kilodalton glycoprotein of human saliva is a bacterial agglutinin with specificity for certain strains of s. mutans. they further suggest that aggregation is mediated by polypeptide rather than carbohydrate determinants of the glycoprotein.

AB  == five monoclonal antibodies directed against streptococcus mutans strain jbp lipoteichoic acid (lta) were characterized. they were all similarly reactive with the immunizing lta-containing extract, with intact strep. mutans jbp cells and with lta purified from lactobacillus casei. immobilized anti-lta antibodies removes lta from lta-containing extracts. the binding of antibodies to lta was inhibited by the aqueous extract but not by the organic extract of de-acylated lta, indicating reactivity with the polyglycerol-phosphate portion of the molecule. antibodies were reactive with all serotypes of strep. mutans, as well as with strains of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis and l. casei,  but not with lta-negative species streptococcus mitis or actinomyces viscosus. anti-lta antibodies at doses of 0.3 or 3.0 micrograms/ml, had no effect on the adherence of strep. mutans jbp to experimental salivary pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite, but enhanced adherence 150-300 per cent at 30 micrograms/ml. there was no effect of anti-lta antibodies in a chemostat model which measured sucrose-dependent plaque accumulation by strep. mutans. the results argue against a major role for lta in strep. mutans adherence or plaque accumulation in vitro.

TI  == streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus detection in the assessment of dental root surface caries risk.
AB  == forty-five subjects contributing 150 root surfaces with gingival recession were sampled seven times over a 32-month period. we calculated isolation frequencies of lactobacilli on selective rogosa sl agar and s. mutans in a sensitive enrichment broth and on mitis salivarius agar. both s. mutans and lactobacilli were isolated more frequently from surfaces which became carious than from those  remaining caries-free. isolation frequencies were also higher for caries-free surfaces in caries-active subjects than for caries-free surfaces in caries-inactive subjects. the presence or absence of s. mutans and lactobacilli in samples taken at baseline could discriminate between subjects who were to be root-caries-active and those who were to remain root-caries-inactive during the subsequent observation period. moreover, if both bacteria were detected or only s. mutans was detected on a root surface at its entry into the study, that surface had a greater risk for developing a root lesion. however, the tests could not predict which root surfaces within the mouths of caries-active subjects were  to become carious. analysis of the data suggests that simple microbiological detection tests may be useful in identifying patients at high risk of root caries.

AB  == contact angle measurements on layers of bacteria were used to determine the bacterial surface free energy (gamma b) of a variety of oral streptococcal strains, both without and after being coated with human whole saliva. at least four isolates of each species, either freshly isolated or laboratory strains, were used. the species streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, and s. salivarius were homogeneous, having high surface free energies, and were not affected by saliva treatment (gamma b = 106 +/- 12 and 107 +/- 10 erg x cm-2 in the absence and presence of saliva coating, respectively; n = 20). s. mitis had a very low surface free energy (46 +/- 15; n = 5), which was significantly increased after salivary adsorption (71 +/- 14 erg x cm-2; p less than 0.002). the species s. milleri contained strains with both high and low gamma b. calculation of the interfacial free energy of adhesion (delta f adh) for bacteria from a saliva suspension to solid surfaces with various arbitrary surface free energies (gamma  s) showed that, theoretically, most strains will encounter thermodynamically favorable conditions for adhesion to surfaces with a gamma s above 62 erg x cm-2. however, s. mitis strains not coated with saliva would only be able to adhere to  surfaces with gamma s lower than this value. saliva-coating reverses the calculated relationship with gamma s for these strains. the results indicate that an enamel surface with a low gamma s value would be thermodynamically unfavorable for adhesion of most oral streptococci.

TI  == glucose-sucrose-potassium tellurite-bacitracin agar, an alternative to mitis salivarius-bacitracin agar for enumeration of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an agar medium for selective recovery and enumeration of streptococcus mutans was developed as an alternative to mitis salivarius-bacitracin (msb) agar. combinations of dyes, antibiotics, and tellurite were added to a nonselective medium which, because of its sucrose content, allowed easy recognition of s. mutans colonies. candle jar incubation for 2 days, by comparison with anaerobic incubation, reduced background flora but did not diminish s. mutans recoveries from clinical samples. quantitative comparisons were made of the simultaneous recoveries of a number of authentic s. mutans serotype representatives and fresh  clinical isolates, using various glucose-sucrose-potassium tellurite-bacitracin (gstb) formulations and mitis salivarius, msb, and blood agars. mitis salivarius  counts were not detectably different from blood counts, but counts on msb were distinctly lower. a formulation of the new medium containing 5% glucose 5% sucrose, 0.001% potassium tellurite, 0.3 u of bacitracin per ml (hence gstb), and 2% agar gave recoveries nearly equal to those on mitis salivarius agar and much greater than those on msb. the medium yielded readily recognized s. mutans colonies and facilitated detection of intracellular polysaccharide formers upon flooding with i2 reagent. freshly isolated serotype c, e, and f colonies could often be distinguished from serotype d and g colonies, a distinction made reliable by testing for intracellular polysaccharide. a study of 300 salivary samples revealed gstb to give significantly higher recoveries than msb. about 72% of all samples were substantially underestimated for s. mutans with msb, and 6.7% of samples were falsely negative for s. mutans with msb. recovery of background flora on gstb was as low or lower than on msb, and both types of agar could be stored for at least 9 weeks without notable change of selectivity. thus, gstb agar appears to be simple and reliable to use and requires no anaerobic incubation. caution is voiced about interpretation of data previously reported which evaluated s. mutans on msb agar.

AB  == the serostat latex agglutination test (scott laboratories, inc., fiskesville, r.i.) for identification of group d streptococci was compared with bile-esculin agar and lancefield grouping by using 110 clinical isolates of group d streptococci (s. faecalis, 74; s. bovis, 24; s. durans, 3; s. faecium, 9) and 65  viridans streptococci (s. anginosus-constellatus, 2; streptococcus mg, 15; s. sanguis ii, 14; s. mitis, 7; s. mutans, 5; s. salivarius, 8; s. sanguis i, 8; s.  acidominimus, 1; s. morbillorum, 2; s. pneumoniae, 3). all strains of group d streptococci were bile-esculin positive. serostat reactions were falsely positive with 2 strains of s. sanguisii and 1 strain of streptococcus mg (4.6% of all viridans streptococci tested) and falsely negative with 10 s. bovis, 8 s. faecalis, 1 s. durans, and 6 s. faecium strains (22.7% of all group d streptococci tested). when considered with colonial morphology and hemolytic reaction, serostat is a rapid (60-s) and useful test for recognition of group d streptococci.

TI  == disseminated tetracycline resistance in oral streptococci: implication of a conjugative transposon.
AB  == a dna sequence specifying tetracycline resistance (tcr) has been previously cloned from a clinical isolate of streptococcus mutans designated u202 (j. a. tobian and f. l. macrina, j. bacteriol. 152:215-222, 1982). we used this sequence as a molecular probe in studying the dissemination of tcr among oral streptococcal species isolated from patients treated with tetracycline. eleven strains (including s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii, s. mitis, and s. salivarius) from seven patients were examined by southern blot analysis. seven strains showed strong hybridization to the tcr probe, two showed weak hybridization, and two did not display detectable hybridization. based on previous characterization of the cloned sequence, our data suggest the dissemination of the tetm class of resistance determinants among these oral streptococci. one of the clinical s. sanguis i isolates studied was able to transfer its tcr phenotype to other oral streptococci and to enteric streptococci in the absence of plasmid dna. this transfer appeared to be conjugation-like on the basis of its insensitivity to dnase and its dependence on intimate cell-to-cell contact. using the cloned tcr sequence, we were able to study the progeny of the matings. our data suggest that this resistance transfer element occupies a chromosomal location in streptococcal cells and that it strongly resembles the conjugative transposon tn916 in its behavior.

TI  == reaction of human colostral and early milk antibodies with oral streptococci.
AB  == colostrum or early breast milk or both from each of 16 healthy women contained agglutinating antibodies for all normal streptococcal inhabitants of the human oral cavity (s. mutans, s. sanguis, s. mitis, and s. salivarius), including those which colonize the neonatal oral cavity in significant numbers. agglutination correlated with the amount of immunoglobulin a (iga) binding to bacterial surfaces as measured by mixed reverse passive antiglobulin hemagglutination. surprisingly, colostral iga agglutinated our control organism, brucella abortus.  low levels of colostral or milk igm and igg antibodies also reacted with all of the test bacteria. absorption studies with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that a proportion of antibodies in colostrum and early milk is specific for each of the different oral streptococci. fractionation on sepharose 4b indicated that 11s secretory iga is the predominant form of colostral and milk antibody for all of the test bacteria, including b. abortus. no evidence was found that reactions other than antigen-antibody reactions resulted in binding of colostral immunoglobulins by any of the test bacteria.

TI  == adherence of oral streptococci: evidence for nonspecific adsorption to saliva-coated hydroxylapatite surfaces.
AB  == it is proposed that binding of oral streptococci to saliva-coated hydroxylapatite (sha) surfaces is a multifactorial process involving both specific and nonspecific receptors. in this context, specific binding is described as a high-affinity, saturable interaction between the cell and binding surface. conversely, nonspecific binding is considered to be a nonsaturable, generalized,  low-affinity reaction. experimental differentiation of specific binding from nonspecific binding was achieved with a competition assay which utilized a large  excess of nonradiolabeled bacteria to compete with the 3h-labeled cells for attachment to receptors on 1.5 mg of sha crystals. competition assays of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis adhesion clearly demonstrated that  the total binding isotherm was composed of a saturable specific binding reaction  and a minor nonspecific binding component. this was further substantiated by analysis of nonlinear scatchard plots of the total binding data. the competition  data for streptococcus mutans binding indicated that ca. 50% of the s. mutans binding appeared to be specific, although saturation of the sha surfaces with bacterial cells could not be demonstrated. experiments measuring desorption of radiolabeled cells from sha crystals into buffer showed that ca. 50% of the bound s. mutans cells were removed after 4 h, whereas less than 5% of the s. sanguis cells were eluted from the sha surfaces. the kinetics of attachment were studied  by using an extract of persea americana as a noncompetitive inhibitor of adherence. the total cell binding data for these experiments suggested a very rapid binding reaction followed by a slower rate of attachment. it was concluded  from these three different experimental approaches that adherence of selected oral streptococci to sha surfaces involves specific, high-affinity and nonspecific, low-affinity binding reactions. the concept is developed that in vitro streptococcal attachment to sha can be described as a two-reaction process  in which the low-affinity interaction of the cell with the sha surface precedes the establishment of the stronger, specific bonds needed for the maintenance of streptococci in the oral cavity.

TI  == clinical isolates of streptococcus mutans serotype c with altered colony morphology due to fructan synthesis.
AB  == streptococcus mutans mt6801 , mt6861 , and mt6879 , which form large mucoid colonies on mitis salivarius agar, were isolated from a mother and her two daughters. these isolates were identified as serotype c by immunodiffusion with serotype-specific antisera. the large colonies formed on sucrose-containing agar  were found to contain water-soluble fructan . the cell-free fructosyltransferase  ( ftase ) activity of the strains which formed large colonies was five to eight times higher than that of serotype c s. mutans which produced small, rough colonies typical of this serotype. furthermore, greater quantities of fructan were synthesized from sucrose by growing cells of mt6801 when compared with mt8148 , a typical serotype c s. mutans. glucosyltransferase and ftase could be isolated by chromatofocusing from culture supernatants of mt6801 and mt8148 . the ftase activity of both strains was eluted at ph 4.5, and glucosyltransferase was  released by elution with an nacl linear gradient. the eluted ftase activity of mt6801 was significantly higher than that of mt8148 . strains mt6861 and mt6879 were also found to possess a similar property in terms of ftase activity. these results suggest that formation of large mucoid colonies by these strains is a consequence of high ftase activity.

TI  == slide-scoring method for estimation of streptococcus mutans levels in saliva.
AB  == a method was developed to facilitate the estimation of s. mutans levels in saliva. paraffin-stimulated saliva was poured on a special slide coated with mitis-salivarius-sucrose agar. two discs containing bacitracin (5 micrograms) were placed on the inoculated slide and the growth density of s. mutans around the bacitracin discs was scored after incubation in candle jars at 37 degrees c for 48 h. the obtained score values correlated well with the numbers of cfu of s. mutans per 1 ml of saliva estimated by a conventional method using mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. the experimental method was further tested by incubating the slides in an atmosphere created by co2-generating tables that were placed into the cover tubes of the slides. these score values were similar to those after conventional incubation. the method is suggested for epidemiologic studies and in selecting persons at high risk for caries and in controlling the effectiveness of prophylactic measures of these patients.

TI  == regulation of glucose metabolism in oral streptococci through independent pathways of glucose 6-phosphate and glucose 1-phosphate formation.
AB  == in vivo rates of glucose uptake and acid production by oral streptococci grown in glucose- or nitrogen-limited continuous culture and batch culture were compared with the glucose phosphorylation activities of harvested, decryptified cells. the strains examined contained significant phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system (pts) activity, measured by a glucose 6-phosphate (g6p) dehydrogenase-linked assay procedure, but this activity was insufficient to account for the in vivo glucose uptake rates. however, atp was a superior phosphoryl donor to phosphoenolpyruvate, and unlike the pts, phosphoryl transfer  with atp was insensitive to bacteriostatic concentrations of chlorhexidine, suggesting glucokinase-mediated g6p formation. again, g6p formation from the pts  and glucokinase reactions was not commensurate with some of the glucose uptake rates observed, implying that other phosphorylation reactions must be occurring.  two novel reactions involving carbamyl phosphate and acetyl phosphate were identified in some of the strains. no g6p formation was detected with these potential phosphoryl donors, but in the presence of phosphoglucomutase, glucose 1-phosphate (g1p) formation was evident, which was insensitive to chlorhexidine.  g1p is a precursor of glycogen, and good correlation was obtained between g1p formation activity and endogenous metabolism of washed cells measured either as a rate of acid production at a constant ph 7 or as a decrease in ph with time in the absence of titrant. a "league table" of abilities to synthesize g1p and produce acid from endogenous metabolism was compiled for oral streptococci grown  in batch culture. this indicated that streptococcus mutans ingbritt and streptococcus sanguis challis were unable to form g1p or produce much acid endogenously, whereas increasing activities were obtained with streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis. in particular, s. mitis had the highest g1p formation activities and was able to decrease the ph to less than 5 in 15 min by endogenous metabolism alone. the data are consistent with the intracellular accumulation of free glucose driven by proton motive force when pts activities are low and the subsequent phosphorylation to either g6p for  metabolism via glycolysis or g1p for glycogen biosynthesis. the accumulation of acetyl phosphate during glucose-limited growth and the availability of arginine for catabolism to carbamyl phosphate provide an explanation as to why some glucose-limited oral streptococci continue to synthesize glycogen under these conditions, which might prevail in plaque.

TI  == in-vivo dental plaque-forming ability and relative cariogenicity of the bacteria  streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis i and ii in mono-infected gnotobiotic rats.
AB  == sixteen strains of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguis i and strep. sanguis ii were tested for cariogenic potential and in-vivo plaque-forming ability in a gnotobiotic wag/rij rat test system. all strains produced far less fissure plaque in vivo than strains of streptococcus milleri or streptococcus mutans. there was less extracellular matrix around cells of strep. mitis or strep. sanguis than around strep. mutans, in the fissures. dense sheets of cells  were observed only with strep. mutans. some localized colonization of exposed smooth surfaces occurred with most strains. strep. mitis produced no caries in three tests, low-caries scores in two tests and high-caries scores in one test. a single strain of strep. mitis produced a highly-cariogenic variant able to ferment raffinose. strep. sanguis i induced low-levels of caries in 12 tests; one test of nctc 7865 produced moderate levels of caries, and another test of 311 produced no caries. strep. sanguis 311 was dextran-negative. strep. sanguis ii strains induced no caries in three tests, low caries scores in six tests and moderate levels of caries with strep. sanguis 402. no strain of strep. mitis or strep. sanguis was able to induce smooth-surface lesions.

AB  == pure cultures of representative strains of cariogenic and non-cariogenic plaque bacteria were assessed for their ability to initiate and maintain growth in broths, adjusted to initial ph levels of 7.0, 5.5 or 5.0, and to produce lactic acid from sucrose or glucose in resting-cell suspensions at ph 6.5, 5.0, 4.5 and  4.0. streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei and streptococcus faecalis showed  greater acid tolerance than strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis and actinomyces viscosus. for all species, growth initiation in broth was more acid sensitive than lactic-acid production in resting-cell suspensions. these data confirm and extend previous observations that the species of plaque bacteria most closely associated with the initiation or progression of dental caries are more aciduric than non-cariogenic species.

AB  == sugar transport and glycolysis in streptococcus sanguis nctc 7865, streptococcus  mitis atcc 903, streptococcus salivarius nctc 8606 and several strains of streptococcus mutans were investigated by following the rate of acid production by washed bacteria at a constant ph of 7.0. the phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system (pts) was inhibited by low concentrations of chlorhexidine. when this pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine was added to cells washed and re-suspended in kcl, glucose uptake and glycolysis continued at a greatly-reduced rate. chlorhexidine abolished glucose and sucrose uptake and metabolism in bacteria washed and incubated in saline. the na+-inhibition was reproduced in kcl-washed bacteria using the cyclic peptide ionophores, valinomycin and gramicidin, to dissipate k+ and h+ gradients  across the cell membrane. glucose metabolism by strep. mutans b13 was more resistant to chlorhexidine than that of strep. mutans nctc 10449 or strep. sanguis but was more sensitive to the ionophores. valinomycin had a greater inhibitory effect on strain b13 than the other two. that ion gradients are important in the chlorhexidine-resistant glucose-uptake mechanism was confirmed using the classical uncoupling agents, carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone, 2,4-dinitrophenol and kscn. glucose metabolism was inhibited in the presence of both the uncouplers and the pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine and significant inhibition was also observed in the absence of the pts inhibitor. lactate or the atpase inhibitor, dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (dccd), had similar inhibitory effects on the non-pts uptake system.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == comparative hydrophobicities of oral bacteria and their adherence to salivary pellicles.
AB  == oral bacteria were found to differ in their surface hydrophobicities as determined by their ability to adsorb to hexadecane. strains of actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, streptococcus sanguis, s. mitis, and bacteroides gingivalis proved highly hydrophobic. strains of b. intermedius, s. salivarius, s. mutans, and b. melaninogenicus were less hydrophobic, whereas strains of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were hydrophilic. an overall correlation was noted between the adsorption of bacteria to hexadecane and their numbers which attached to experimental salivary pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite surfaces. this suggests that hydrophobic bonding plays an important role in this process. pellicles prepared from saliva which had been extracted with chloroform-methanol  to remove lipids adsorbed comparable numbers of s. sanguis and a. viscosus and increased numbers of s. mutans. analyses of adsorption isotherms indicated that pellicles formed from lipid-depleted saliva contained increased numbers of binding sites for the s. mutans strains studied, and this likely accounts for their enhanced adsorption. absorption of saliva with 10% octyl or phenyl sepharose reduced the protein content of saliva by almost half, but the numbers of bacteria which attached to pellicles prepared from such absorbed saliva were similar to or higher than those which attached to control pellicles. these observations suggest that saliva does not contain unique highly hydrophobic salivary macromolecules which serve as essential pellicle receptors for the bacteria studied. the data obtained are consistent with the view that hydrophobic bonding together with interactions between complementary molecules are involved in bacterial attachment to salivary pellicles on teeth.

AB  == fresh oral isolates from human dental plaque were selected on the basis of their  spherical morphology. in a double-blind experiment, their species identity and ability to coaggregate with human oral actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii were determined. of the 110 isolates characterized, 30 were identified as either streptococcus mutans, streptococcus anginosus-constellatus, or veillonella parvula; none of these coaggregated with the actinomycetes. the remaining 80 isolates were identified as streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mg-intermedius, or streptococcus morbillorum. of these 49 isolates (61%) coaggregated with actinomycetes, and nearly 90% (43 of 49 isolates) exhibited lactose-inhibitable coaggregations. compared with previously  characterized coaggregation properties determined with stock culture strains of streptococci, 82% of the fresh isolates exhibited identical coaggregations. the other 18% made up a new coaggregation group that possessed a related lactose-inhibitable coaggregation pattern. thus, most fresh isolates that coaggregated exhibited lactose-inhibitable coaggregations with human oral actinomycetes. it is suggested that these coaggregations are mediated by a network of lectin-carbohydrate interactions similar to those already characterized in previous studies with stock cultures of actinomycetes and streptococci.

TI  == hydrogen peroxide excretion by oral streptococci and effect of lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == approved type strains of streptococcus sanguis, s. mitis, s. mutans, and s. salivarius were grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. the rate of hydrogen peroxide excretion, oxygen uptake, and acid production from glucose by washed-cell suspensions of these strains were studied, and the levels of enzymes  in cell-free extracts which reduced oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, or hypothiocyanite (oscn-) in the presence of nadh or nadph were assayed. the effects of lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide on the rate of acid production and  oxygen uptake by intact cells, the activity of glycolytic enzymes in cell-free extracts, and the levels of intracellular glycolytic intermediates were also studied. all strains consumed oxygen in the presence of glucose. s. sanguis, s. mitis, and anaerobically grown s. mutans excreted hydrogen peroxide. there was higher nadh oxidase and nadh peroxidase activity in aerobically grown cells than  in anaerobically grown cells. nadph oxidase activity was low in all species. acid production, oxygen uptake, and, consequently, hydrogen peroxide excretion were inhibited in all the strains by lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide. s. sanguis and s. mitis had a higher capacity than s. mutans and s. salivarius to recover from this inhibition. higher activity in the former strains of an nadh-oscn oxidoreductase, which converted oscn- into thiocyanate, explained this  difference. the change in levels of intracellular glycolytic intermediates after  inhibition of glycolysis by oscn- and the actual activity of glycolytic enzymes in cell-free extracts in the presence of oscn- indicated that the primary target  of oscn- in the glycolytic pathway was glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.

TI  == purification and properties of pyruvate kinase from streptococcus sanguis and activator specificity of pyruvate kinase from oral streptococci.
AB  == it was found that pyruvate kinases with two different regulatory characteristics  were distributed among oral streptococci. the pyruvate kinases of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus bovis were activated by glucose 6-phosphate, whereas the enzymes of both streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis were activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. pyruvate kinase  (ec 2.7.1.40) from s. sanguis nctc 10904 was purified, giving a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the enzyme had a molecular weight of 250,000 to 260,000 and consisted of four identical subunits.  whereas the pyruvate kinase from s. mutans was completely dependent on glucose 6-phosphate (k. abbe and t. yamada, j. bacteriol. 149:299-305, 1982), the enzyme  from s. sanguis was activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. in the presence of 0.5 mm fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, the saturation curves for the substrates, phosphoenolpyruvate and adp, were hyperbolic, and the km values were 0.13 and 0.30 mm, respectively. without fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, however, saturation curves for both substrates were sigmoidal. gdp, idp, and udp could replace adp. like the enzyme from s. mutans, the enzyme from s. sanguis required a divalent cation, mg2+ or mn2+, and a monovalent cation, k+ or nh4+, for activity, and it was strongly inhibited by pi. when the concentration of pi was increased, the half-saturating concentration and hill coefficient for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate  increased. the remarkable fluctuation of intracellular levels of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate observed in the cells growing under glucose limitation and nitrogen limitation implies that the intracellular concentration of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, in cooperation with that of pi, may regulate pyruvate kinase activity in s. sanguis in vivo.

TI  == inhibition by the antimicrobial agent chlorhexidine of acid production and sugar  transport in oral streptococcal bacteria.
AB  == oral streptococci transport sugars via the phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase (pep-pts) system. in a specific assay of this system, low concentrations of chlorhexidine abolished the activity of the glucose and sucrose pts in batch-grown cells of streptococcus mutans ingbritt and b13, strep. sanguis nctc 7865, strep. mitis atcc 903, strep. milleri nctc 10709 and strep. salivarius nctc 8606. intact cells and cells made permeable to the assay reagents with toluene were used. toluenized cells were more sensitive to chlorhexidine than intact cells (0.09 and 0.25 mm, respectively). this pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine reduced acid production from glucose in ph fall experiments to values higher than are obtained solely from endogenous metabolism. the effect of  chlorhexidine on rates of acid production was determined at ph 7.0 using cells washed with either 135 mm nacl or 135 mm kcl. in general, faster rates of acid production from the metabolism of glucose and sucrose were obtained with potassium-treated cells. addition of the pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine markedly reduced or totally abolished acid production by nacl-treated cells; a greater residual-activity was detected in the same cells washed with kcl (except with strep. mutans b13 and strep. mitis atcc 903). the pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine had little or no effect on the viability of cells. the results confirm the existence of sugar uptake systems in  oral streptococci additional to the pts and provide an explanation for the additive anti-caries effect of mouth-rinses containing both fluoride and chlorhexidine.

TI  == a selective medium for the two major subgroups of the bacterium streptococcus mutans isolated from human dental plaque and saliva.
AB  == a selective medium was developed on which both major subgroups of strep. mutans (c/e/f and d/g) can be cultured and recognized on the basis of colonial morphology, trypticase, yeast, cystine (tyc) agar was modified by adding separately autoclaved sucrose to a final concentration of 20 per cent and 0.1 unit/ml bacitracin (tycsb). this medium yielded significantly higher counts of strep. mutans than the widely used mitis-salivarius bacitracin (msb) medium.

TI  == glucose uptake by streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, and actinomyces viscosus in the presence of human saliva.
AB  == glucose uptake was examined by using whole-cell suspensions of streptococcus mutans (strains bht, ingbritt, and gs-5), streptococcus mitis (strains 9811 and 72x41), and actinomyces viscosus (strains t6 and wvu626) incubated for up to 90 min in 0 to 82% (vol/vol) human whole salivary supernatant. glucose uptake by the s. mutans strains was completely inhibited at all saliva concentrations. dithiothreitol (dtt), present during saliva incubation, prevented saliva inhibition. glucose uptake was also restored when saliva-inhibited cells were subsequently exposed to dtt. the inclusion of catalase in the saliva incubation mixtures resulted in protection equal to that obtained with dtt. the s. mitis strains were also inhibited by saliva but to a far lesser extent that s. mutans.  dtt and catalase also protected s. mitis from saliva inhibition. both a. viscosus strains were completely refractory to saliva inhibition of glucose uptake. based  on (i) the sensitivity of the catalase-negative streptococci and the resistance of catalase-positive actinomyces to saliva inhibition and (ii) the equal and complete protection to saliva inhibition afforded by dtt and catalase, we conclude that the lactoperoxidase-scn(-)-h(2)o(2) system in saliva was the only antibacterial system expressed under our experimental conditions. the relative resistance of s. mitis 9811 (compared with s. mutans bht) to saliva inhibition was shown not to result from poor h(2)o(2) production in either glucose-supplemented buffer or saliva solutions. s. mitis produced inhibitory quantities of h(2)o(2) that equaled or exceeded s. mutans h(2)o(2) accumulation.  it is suggested that s. mitis might possess a greater ability to repair lactoperoxidase-mediated damage than does s. mutans. every organism studied exhibited a saliva concentration-dependent, cell growth-independent stimulation of glucose uptake after 60 to 90 min of incubation. the a. viscosus and s. mitis  strains showed saliva stimulation (or stabilization) of glucose uptake with unsupplemented saliva. in the case of s. mutans, saliva stimulation was only observed when dtt was present. the possible role of salivary lactoperoxidase as a modulator of the intraoral site specificities exhibited by s. mutans is discussed.

TI  == [viridans streptococci in human infections: identification and susceptibility to  antibiotics].
AB  == a method for the speciation of viridans streptococci (devoided of group antigens) is described. the major identification criteria are based on the reaction of a series of biochemical tests such as acid production in lactose, inuline, raffinose, mannitol and sorbitol, hydrolysis of arginine, esculin and na hippurate, and production of polysaccharides in 5% sucrose media. a total of 460  strains were isolated from human specimens and identified as follows: 118 streptococcus mitis, 102 s. sanguis ii, 75 s. sanguis i, 87 s. milleri (streptococcus mg-intermedius), 28 s. mutans, 25 s. salivarius, 14 s. morbillorium, 2 s. uberis and 9 unspeciated. susceptibility to antibiotics was studied for 318 strains: 63% of them were susceptible to all drugs tested; 37% of the strains were resistant to one or several antibiotics as follows: 34% to tetracycline, 8.5% to macrolides and related drugs, 5.3% to streptomycin and/or kanamycin (mic greater than 2,000 micrograms/ml), 5% to penicillin (mic = 1-4 micrograms/ml) and 4% to chloramphenicol.

TI  == inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis by soluble bacterial products.
AB  == bacterial-neutrophil interactions may be critical determinants of virulence in periodontal diseases. this study was undertaken to examine the ability of major bacterial species from the human oral cavity to inhibit (1) peripheral blood neutrophil chemotaxis, (2) chemotactic formylmethionyl peptide binding, and (3) phagocytosis. included were cultured supernatants and sonic extracts obtained from strains of capnocytophaga, bacteroides gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum,  bacteroides asaccharolyticus, capnocytophaga species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, neisseria, actinomyces viscosus, bacterionema matruchotii, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sanguis. chemotaxis  was measured using boyden chambers; phagocytosis was determined using staphylococcus aureus as the indicator organism and radioactive chemotactic peptide binding was assessed by a rapid filtration assay. none of the test organisms were cytotoxic to neutrophils or inhibited neutrophil phagocytosis. capnocytophaga species., bacteroides species., a. actinomycetemcomitans, and f. nucleatum produced factors which specifically inhibited neutrophil chemotaxis. activity was lost after dialysis. extracts of bacteroides species, a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum, which were not chemotactic by themselves, inhibited binding of chemotactic peptide suggesting that in vitro chemotaxis inhibition was mediated by nonchemotactic components that compete for the chemotactic factor receptor on the neutrophil. the exception was capnocytophaga which appeared to inhibit chemotaxis by inhibition of a post-binding event. such  chemotactic inhibitors from periodontopathic organisms that inhibit neutrophil function may be important determinants of virulence.

TI  == adsorption of lysozyme from human whole saliva by streptococcus sanguis 903 and other oral microorganisms.
AB  == several strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, and actinomyces naeslundii plus fresh isolates of streptococcus salivarius were surveyed for their abilities to deplete lysozyme from human-whole-saliva supernatant. bacteria were incubated in saliva for 60 min at 37 degrees c and then removed by centrifugation, and the recovered supernatant solutions were assayed for lysozyme activity by using whole cells of micrococcus  lysodeikticus as the substrate. mean lysozyme depletions by bacterial strains varied over a wide (eightfold) range. the greatest mean depletion of lysozyme (60 to 70%) was observed with s. sanguis (biotype i), serotype b of s. mutans, and the fresh s. salivarius isolates. the lowest mean depletion was noted with s. mitis (15%) and biotype ii s. sanguis (ca. 30%). the remaining species and strains exhibited an intermediate degree of depletion. in studies with s. sanguis 903, lysozyme was depleted by normal or heated (90 degrees c, 30 min) bacteria and could be recovered from the organism. furthermore, under appropriate conditions, lysozyme depletion by cells at 0 and 37 degrees c was very similar. on the basis of these observations, we concluded that depletion was due to the adsorption of lysozyme by the organism. with s. sanguis 903, lysozyme adsorption  depended on the concentration of bacteria, time of incubation, and the ionic strength of the medium. the extent of adsorption, however, was independent of ph's of 3.9 to 8.3. when a low concentration of s. sanguis 903 was used, lysozyme adsorption reached saturation (4 mug of adsorbed lysozyme per 10(7) cells) at 20  mug of lysozyme added per ml. salivary lysozyme adsorption by several other oral  microorganisms (a. viscosus wvu 626 and wvu 627, s. sanguis 73x11, s. mutans bht, and s. salivarius ng) was similar to that of s. sanguis 903 in sensitivity to ionic strength. lysozyme adsorption by s. sanguis 903 from either a buffer solution or a saliva supernatant was more sensitive to ionic strength at 0 than at 37 degrees c. on the basis of results from experiments in saliva versus buffer, we concluded that saliva had no major effect on the extent of lysozyme adsorption by s. sanguis 903 other than providing a source of ionic strength. a comparison of ph and ionic strength effects on lysozyme adsorption by s. sanguis  903 with literature reports of lysozyme lysis of whole cells and hydrolysis of cell walls, peptidoglycan, and (glcnac)(4) suggested that adsorption by s. sanguis 903 was more dependent on electrostatic interactions than was lysozyme catalysis. the possibility is discussed that anionic bacterial surface components mediate lysozyme adsorption and temper the potential effects of lysozyme on the microorganisms.

TI  == enzymatic modification of bacterial receptors on saliva-treated hydroxyapatite surfaces.
AB  == certain properties of experimental pellicles formed by the adsorption of salivary components on hydroxyapatite surfaces change over time. to determine whether enzymes likely to be present in the oral environment could induce such changes, pellicles were treated with saliva which had been incubated for 18 h at 35 degrees c to promote the elaboration of microbial enzymes. this treatment markedly reduced the numbers of streptococcus mutans mt3 and jbp and s. sanguis fc-1 and c5 cells which attached, but it had little or no effect on the attachment of s. mitis re7, actinomyces viscosus ly7 and ck-8, bacteroides gingivalis 381, or b. melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius 581. heating the incubated saliva at 60 degrees c for 30 min partially reduced its pellicle-modifying activity, whereas heating at 80 degrees c for 30 min or 100 degrees c for 15 min completely eliminated such activity. this indicated that the saliva contained heat-labile substances, presumably enzymes, which could affect the pellicle receptors involved in the attachment of s. mutans and s. sanguis. treatment of saliva-treated hydroxyapatite with commercially obtained enzyme preparations also affected bacterial attachment. thus, treatment with galactose oxidase reduced the numbers of the s. mutans strains which attached, whereas treatment with neuraminidase reduced the adsorption of s. sanguis fc-1 but not that of s. sanguis c5. treatment with beta-glucosidase preparations derived from  almonds significantly reduced the attachment of all of the streptococcal strains  studied, but, when subjected to isoelectric fractionation, the adherence-inhibiting activity did not correlate directly with beta-glucosidase activity. treatment of the pellicles with trypsin or eight other glycosidases did not affect streptococcal attachment. exposure of the enzymatically modified pellicles to fresh saliva did not restore the streptococcal receptors. collectively, the data suggest that some bacterial receptors in the pellicle coating of teeth can be modified by enzymes likely to be present in the oral environment, and these interactions may affect oral bacterial ecology.

TI  == characteristic differences between saliva-dependent aggregation and adhesion of streptococci.
AB  == comparison of saliva-mediated aggregation of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus mutans and adhesion of these organisms to saliva-coated  hydroxyapatite showed that there was no relationship between these two activities. adsorption of salivary aggregating activity to bacteria appears to have little effect on the ability of the residual saliva to support adherence; conversely, adsorption of salivary adherence factors to hydroxyapatite does not affect aggregation. although heating saliva significantly reduces bacterial aggregation, it has little or no effect on adherence. a comparison of aggregation and adhesion with serial dilutions of saliva demonstrated that adhesion could still be detected at 100 to 500-fold-lower concentrations of salivary protein that bacterial aggregation. these findings support the concept that aggregation and adherence involve two distinct mechanisms of microbial clearance in the oral  cavity.

TI  == effect of human saliva on glucose uptake by streptococcus mutans and other oral microorganisms.
AB  == we examined the effects of human whole salivary supernatant and parotid fluid on  glucose uptake by streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. the following three effects of saliva were observed: (i) inhibition of glucose uptake (s. mutans, s. sanguis), (ii) promotion of a transient, rapid (0 to 30 s) burst of glucose uptake (s. mutans, s. sanguis), and (iii) enhancement of glucose uptake (s. mitis, a. viscosus, s. aureus, e. coli). we observed no differences between the effects of whole salivary supernatant and the effects of parotid fluid. heat treatment (80 degrees c, 10 min) of saliva or the addition of dithiothreitol abolished inhibition of glucose uptake. supplementation of saliva  with h(2)o(2) potentiated inhibition of glucose uptake. s. mitis and a. viscosus, which were stimulated by saliva alone, were inhibited by h(2)o(2)-supplemented saliva; 50% inhibition of glucose uptake by s. mutans and s. mitis required ca. 10 mum h(2)o(2) in 50% (vol/vol) saliva. loss of the inhibitory action of saliva  occurred at about 5% (vol/vol) saliva. supplementation of saliva dilutions with scn(-) and h(2)o(2) extended the inhibitory activity to solutions containing ca.  0.2% (vol/vol) saliva. we suggest that the salivary lactoperoxidase-scn(-)-h(2)o(2) system is responsible for the inhibitory activity of saliva reported here. furthermore, we concluded that lactoperoxidase and scn(-) are present in saliva specimens in concentrations that exceed minimal inhibitory levels by factors of ca. 500 and 10 to 20, respectively. the resistance of a. viscosus, s. aureus, and e. coli to the inhibitory potential of  saliva alone was probably due to the production of catalase by these organisms. the resistance of s. mitis may have been due to special effects of saliva on h(2)o(2) accumulation by this organism compared with s. mutans and s. sanguis. the basis of saliva-dependent enhancement of glucose uptake and the basis of promotion of a transient, rapid burst of glucose uptake are unknown. the role of  the salivary lactoperoxidase-scn(-)-h(2)o(2) system in the oral microbial ecosystem is discussed.

TI  == virulence-related physiological changes and antigenic variation in populations of streptococcus mutans colonizing gnotobiotic rats.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine if populations of streptococcus mutans which were undergoing antigenic variation while colonizing gnotobiotic rats concomitantly became altered in physiological characteristics which affected their virulence. s. mutans strain jbp (serotype c), which was freshly isolated from a carious lesion in a 6-year old child, was used to inoculate gnotobiotic rats; uninfected animals served as controls. substrains were isolated from animals 1, 2, 3, 4, and 12 weeks after infection; samples of pilocarpine-stimulated saliva were also obtained from representative animals for  antibody analyses. isolates derived from stock cultures of strain jbp proved to be homogeneous with respect to all of the physiological characteristics monitored. however, substrains isolated from the animals within 4 weeks after infection were altered with respect to their ability to agglutinate in the presence of sucrose, their ability to form adherent growth in sucrose broth, and  the terminal ph attained in glucose broth. some isolates obtained 12 weeks after  infection no longer synthesized detectable levels of c antigen or intracellular glycogen, and they formed atypical smooth colonies on mitis salivarius agar. with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, low levels of immunoglobulin a (iga) antibodies reactive with whole jbp cells were detected in saliva samples of uninfected control animals at each sampling period; these evidently were induced  to antigens contained in the diet of the animals. significantly higher levels of  iga antibodies were present in saliva samples from animals infected with strain jbp for 3 weeks or longer. thus, the emergence of antigenic and physiological variants of s. mutans in the animals was paralleled by increased levels of salivary iga antibodies. the reactivity of salivary igg with jbp cells was low, and it fluctuated in both groups of animals. no antibodies of the igm class were  detected. when tested in gnotobiotic rats, several variants, including strains which no longer formed typical rough colonies or adherent growth in sucrose broth, proved much less virulent than parental strain jbp in inducing carious lesions. prior oral immunization, which resulted in higher levels of salivary and serum iga antibodies reactive with strain jbp, was found to accelerate the emergence of smooth-colony variants in the animals; it was also associated with decreased streptococcal population levels on the teeth and in feces of the rats.  it is suggested that part of the mechanism by which artificial immunization leads to a reduction in dental caries development in experimental animals is due to the earlier selection of less virulent streptococcal populations.

TI  == role of bacterial interactions in the colonization of oral surfaces of actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == the effects of several microbial residents of human oral cavities on the attachment of actinomyces viscosus t14v to tooth surfaces were assessed by using  the saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha) in vitro system. attachment to sha by a. viscosus t14v was not inhibited in the presence of streptococcus mutans gs5, either in the presence or absence of sucrose. precoating sha beads with s. mutans in the presence of sucrose also did not retard strain t14v attachment. however, the presence of streptococcus sanguis m5 during strain t14v attachment markedly inhibited the interaction of a. viscosus t14v with sha, whereas another s. sanguis strain, strain g9b, produced relatively weak inhibition. the inhibitory effect of s. sanguis m5 appeared to result from the direct interaction of this organism with a. viscosus t14v. conversely, the presence of strain t14v markedly  increased the attachment of s. sanguis m5 to sha while partially inhibiting the attachment of s. sanguis g9b. moreover, sha beads precoated with a. viscosus t14v bound much higher levels of s. sanguis m5 relative to uncoated sha, whereas s. sanguis g9b attachment was only weakly inhibited. it was also observed that sha beads precoated with either s. sanguis m5 or g9b inhibited subsequent attachment  by strain t14v. these results suggest the possibility that the attachment sites for both s. sanguis strains partially overlap those for a. viscosus t14v. streptococcus mitis weakly inhibited attachment of strain t14v to sha, and both streptococcus salivarius and lactobacillus casei had little effect on attachment. in addition, both a radioisotope attachment assay and fluorescent microscopy demonstrated no significant attachment of a. viscosus t14v to human epithelial cells.

TI  == in vitro studies of dental plaque formation: adsorption of oral streptococci to hydroxyaptite.
AB  == a mixture of saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads and radioactively labeled bacteria has been employed as an in vitro model for the initial phase of dental plaque formation. adsorption in this model can be expressed by the langmuir adsorption isotherm, and the adherence of oral streptococci can be expressed as the product of the affinity constant (ka) and the number of binding sites (n), kan. with this approach, streptococcus sanguis serotype 1 strains adhered better  (kan = [187 +/- 72] x 10(-2)) than serotype 2 strains (kan = [97 +/- 84] x 10(-2)); a t test showed this difference to be statistically significant to the 99.99% confidence level. strains of s. mitis, s. mutans, and s. salivarius did not appear to adhere as well. to analyze the bacterial receptors involved in adherence, competition studies in which increasing quantities of unlabeled bacteria were added to a fixed quantity (4 x 10(9) cells per ml) of 3h-labeled serotype 1, reference strain s. sanguis g9b, were performed. these studies indicated that the type 1 strains competed for the same, or closely related, binding sites. competition studies using serotype 2 s. sanguis strains resulted in an increased binding of reference strain g9b to hydroxyapatite. scanning electron microscopy indicated this effect was due to the formation of localized aggregations of bacteria, presumably representing the two bacterial types. the results of competition studies with s. mitis were variable, and several strains of other oral bacteria showed little or no competition.

TI  == specificity of coaggregation reactions between human oral streptococci and strains of actinomyces viscosus or actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == coaggregation reactions between actinomycete and streptococcal cells occurred frequently when human strains of actinomyces viscosus or a. naeslundii were mixed with human isolates of streptococcus sanguis or s. mitis, but were infrequent with other oral actinomycetes and streptococci. two groups of actinomycetes and four groups of streptococci were defined by the patterns of their coaggregation reactions and by the ability of beta-linked galactosides (i.e., lactose) to reverse these reactions. coaggregations occurred by one of the following three kinds to cell-cell interactions: (i) coaggregation that was blocked by heating the streptococcus but not the actinomycete and was not reversed by lactose; (ii)  coaggregation that was blocked by heating the actinomycete but not the streptococcus and was reversed by lactose; and (iii) coaggregation that was blocked only by heating both cell types. the latter reaction was a combination of the first two since lactose reversed coaggregation between heated streptococci and unheated actinomycetes but did not reverse coaggregations between unheated streptococci and heated actinomycetes. cells that could be heat inactivated also  were inactivated by amino group acetylation or protease digestion, whereas cells  that were unaffected by heat were not inactivated by these treatments. coaggregation reactions of each kind were ca2+ dependent and insensitive to dextranase treatment. these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that human strains of a. viscosus and a. naeslundii coaggregate with strains of s. sanguis and s. mitis by a system of specific cell surface interactions between protein or glycoprotein receptors on one cell type and carbohydrates on the other type.

AB  == the susceptibility to a cell wall lytic l-11 enzyme from flavobacterium sp. and the quantitative and/or qualitative composition of the cell walls of some strains of cariogenic streptococcus mutans and a non-cariogenic strain of streptococcus mitis were determined. the purified cell walls of s. mutans strains hs-1 (serotype a), bht (b), nctc10449 (c), c67-1 (c), c67-25 (c), omz 176 (d), mt703 (e), mt557 (f), omz65 (g), and aht (g), and s. mitis cht contained glutamic acid, alanine, and lysine as well as muramic acid and glucosamine as a peptidoglycan component. besides these amino acids, significant amounts of threonine were detected in strains hs-1, omz65, and aht cell walls, and considerable amounts of  aspartic acid and/or threonine as well as several other amino acids in omz176, omz65, and cht cell walls. rhamnose was a common special component of the cell walls of s. mutans strains bht, nctc10449, mt703, b2 (e), mt557, and aht, and s.  mitis cht. an additional sugar component, glucose, was detected in the cell walls of all of these strains except bht, and galactose was found in bht, aht, and cht  cell walls. galactosamine was present in s. mitis cht cell walls. varying amounts of phosphorus were detected in the cell walls of all the strains examined. the cell walls of all these streptococcal strains except mt703, 6715, and aht were susceptible to the lytic action of the l-11 enzyme to various extents. no consistent relationship was observed between the amino acid and sugar composition of these cell walls and their susceptibility to the l-11 enzyme. the chemical composition of these cell walls is discussed in terms of the serological classification of s. mutans.

TI  == selective binding of blood group-reactive salivary mucins by streptococcus mutans and other oral organisms.
AB  == strains of streptococcus mutans of four genetic groups and five serotypes, and strains of s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, and a. viscosus, were found to bind blood group-reactive (bgr) mucin isolated from whole human saliva. the bacteria studied bound mucins with blood type a or b reactivity to a similar extent, suggesting that the carbohydrate moieties responsible for the a and b antigenic determinants were not involved. the organisms studied appeared to bind different fractions of bgr mucin molecules because preparations  absorbed with cells of a given oral species no longer contained bgr molecules which bound to homologous organisms but still possessed bgr components which bound to varying degrees to other bacteria. differences were even noted among s.  mutans strains belonging to different genetic groups and serological types. immunoglobulins could not be detected in the mucin preparations, and addition of  anti-human immunoglobulin a (iga), igg, or igm serum to reaction mixtures did not affect binding. mucin pretreated with periodate or iodoacetate no longer bound to s. mutans h12 cells, suggesting that carbohydrate moieties and sulfhydryl groups  played an essential role. active cell metabolism was not required for bgr mucin binding; however, pretreatment of h12 cells with periodate or heat (100 degrees c for 15 min) reduced binding. mucin labeled with [(14)c]phenyl isothiocyanate appeared to bind to s. mutans h12 cells comparably to untreated mucin; the binding also appeared to be specific because less than 15% of the labeled material became bound when incubated with an excess of streptococci. binding of [(14)c]phenyl isothiocyanate-labeled mucin was not affected by neutral sugars tested or by preparations of c antigen, glycerol teichoic acid, dextran, or crude glucosyltransferase. however, binding was inhibited by several amines. bgr salivary mucins are present in the acquired pellicle covering teeth; the ability  of bacteria to selectively bind such components suggest that they may serve as receptor molecules involved in the attachment of bacteria to teeth.

TI  == extractability of cell wall polysaccharide from lactobacilli and streptococci by  autoclaving and by dilue acid.
AB  == autoclaving cell wall of streptococcus mutans ingbritt for 15 min under the rantz and randall conditions released one-tenth of the total cell wall carbohydrate, whereas two-thirds was extracted after autoclaving for 180 min. the extract contained the serotype c-specific antigen but lacked the lipoteichoic acid component extracted when whole cells were autoclaved. autoclaving cell wall preparations from other strains of s. mutans and also streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis in 0.85% nacl for 180 min released the major proportion of the wall polysaccharide fraction. approximately 50 to 90% of wall carbohydrate of lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus casei was released when cell wall preparations were autoclaved in 0.85% nacl for 180 min. for wall preparations from several strains of s. mutans, autoclaving for 60 min at ph 3.75 released only 39 to 62% of wall carbohydrate, whereas almost total release could be achieved with the lactobacilli. heating s. mutans ingbritt cell wall for 24 h at  60 degrees c in 0.1 n h(2)so(4) released only two-thirds of the wall carbohydrate; by comparison nearly all of the wall carbohydrate was released in 3 h from l. casei and l. fermentum. autoclaving l. casei cell wall and purified soluble wall fractions hydrolyzed the phosphodiester bond between the polysaccharide and peptidoglycan. this was shown by the release of reactive n-acetylhexosamine in both cases and the presence of a phosphomonoester in the autoclaved soluble wall fractions. the results indicate that autoclaving can hydrolyze covalent linkages, and this must be considered when the rantz and randall procedure is used to obtain antigen preparations.

TI  == comparative estimates of bacterial affinities and adsorption sites on hydroxyapatite surfaces.
AB  == the adsorption of strains of prominent oral bacteria to hydroxyapatite (ha) surfaces was studied by use of an adsorption model based on the langmuir adsorption isotherm; this permitted comparative estimates of the number of adsorption sites and the strength of the adsorption bonds on untreated and salivatreated ha surfaces for strain of streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. mitis, actinomyces viscosus, and a. naeslundii. the experimental data closely followed the adsorption model as judged by the high correlation coefficients obtained for all strains studied. adsorption to untreated ha was similar for strains of the six species studied, suggesting that a common adsorption mechanism, possibly ca(2+) bridging, may exist for attachment to ha. more complex interactions appeared to be involved in bacterial adsorption to saliva-treated ha since adsorption of the strains tested at unsaturating cell concentrations varied more than 30-fold. this indicates that adsorbed salivary components on ha surfaces impart a higher order of specificity for subsequent bacterial adsorption. fewer cells of strains of s. mutans, s. salivarius, and a.  naeslundii adsorbed to saliva-treated ha than to untreated ha because adsorbed salivary components presented fewer adsorption sites. substantially higher numbers of cells of strains of s. sanguis, s. mitis, and a. viscosus adsorbed to  saliva-treated ha because the film of adsorbed salivary components increased the  number of adsorption sites for these strains. the affinity constants for all but  one strain studied were lower on saliva-treated ha than on untreated ha. the number of bacterial cells which adsorbed to saliva-treated ha more closely related to the number of available binding sites than to the strength of their adsorption bonds when tested at an initial concentration of 2 x 10(7) organisms/ml. although some differences were observed in the adsorption of strains of s. mutans representative of five serological groups, the numbers which attached to saliva-treated ha did not vary widely; this suggests that factors other than their ability to attach to a pellicle-covered ha surface may be responsible for their varying geographic distribution in human populations.

TI  == adherence of veillonella species mediated by extracellular glucosyltransferase from streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == the effect of extracellular products from streptococcus salivarius on sucrose-dependent adherence to smooth surfaces by other oral bacteria was studied in vitro. strains of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pyogenes, and veillonella parvula without innate ability to adhere to a steel wire were able to do so when  incubated with sucrose and cell-free culture fluid from s. salivarius strains 9759, 25975, cnii, and mepi. these culture fluids synthesized more adherent material and water-insoluble glucan than those from streptococcus mutans c67-1 and seven other s. salivarius strains. among the s. salivarius strains, glucosyltransferase (gt; dextransucrase, ec 2.4.1.5) activity varied more than 100-fold. cells of veillonella and s. mitis s3 that had been incubated in culture fluids from s. salivarius 25975 and 9759, respectively, and then washed adhered upon subsequent incubation with sucrose. this was due to adsorbed gt because (i)  the adherence was sensitive to dextranase; (ii) it was observed only with the high-gt culture fluids; (iii) it was dependent on sucrose; and (iv) the washed veillonella cells synthesized glucan, but not fructan, from sucrose. these results suggest that sucrose-dependent adherence of bacteria without such innate  ability can be mediated by (i) entrapment in insoluble glucan synthesized by s. salivarius culture fluids, and (ii) prior adsorption of gt from s. salivarius culture fluids. the possibility that gt formed by high-yield strains of s. salivarius is distributed through the mouth by the action of salivary flow and contributes to sucrose-dependent adherence and plaque formation is considered.

TI  == influence of salivary components and extracellular polysaccharide synthesis from  sucrose on the attachment of streptococcus mutans 6715 to hydroxyapatite surfaces.
AB  == the adsorption of (3)h-labeled streptococcus mutans 6715 cells to disks of hydroxyapatite (ha) was studied. the number of streptococci that adsorbed was logarithmically related to the concentration of cells available up to at least 2  x 10(8) per ml; equilibrium occurred within 45 min. assay reliability was verified by direct scanning electron microscopic counts. untreated ha disks exposed to buffered saline (pbs)-suspended streptococci at a concentration of 1.1 x 10(8) per ml absorbed 3.2 x 10(6) cells per cm(2); approximately 3% of the surface area was, therefore, occupied by adsorbed organisms. the presence of adsorbed salivary components on ha reduced the number of attaching s. mutans cells by half. when s. mutans cells were suspended in saliva to mimic conditions  existing in the mouth, the number of streptococci adsorbing to saliva-treated ha  was reduced more than 30-fold compared to untreated ha. approximately one-half of the streptococci adsorbed to untreated or to saliva-treated ha disks could be desorbed over a 4-h period with 0.067 m phosphate buffer. s. mutans cells exposed to sucrose to permit extracellular polysaccharide synthesis before or during adsorption attached in fewer numbers to both saliva-treated and untreated ha than pbs-treated organisms. when s. mutans cells adsorbed on untreated ha were exposed to sucrose, fewer organisms could be desorbed; thus, in situ polysaccharide synthesis promoted their more firm attachment to untreated ha. however, when saliva-suspended streptococci were adsorbed to saliva-treated ha surfaces, exposure to sucrose before or subsequent to adsorption did not promote more firm  attachment. evidently, the powerful adherence-inhibiting and desorptive effects of salivary components overshadowed any promoting effects attributable to glucan  synthesis from sucrose. similarly, no differences were noted in the desorption of s. mutans cells from human teeth after exposure to sucrose, glucose, or pbs relative to a strain of streptococcus mitis (s. mitior). thus, no evidence was obtained to support the hypothesis that glucan synthesis from sucrose was essential for, or promoted, the attachment of s. mutans cells to ha surfaces exposed to saliva or to the smooth surfaces of human teeth.

TI  == survival of bacteria from human dental plaque under various transport conditions.
AB  == the effects of transport media, temperature, and anaerobiosis on the survival of  bacteria from human supragingival dental plaque were studied. individual samples  were obtained by passing sterile, unwaxed dental floss through the interproximal  spaces. the plaque-bearing portion of floss was immediately placed in vials containing reduced transport fluid, viability-preserving microbistatic medium, or reduced salt solution transport fluid. plaque samples were dispersed by ultrasonic oscillation, serially diluted, and plated in duplicate on mm10-sucrose-blood agar, mitis salivarius bacitracin agar, and rogosa tomato juice agar. initial viable counts (time 0) were compared with viable count determinations after 48- and 72-h storage. quantitative recovery (>30%) of various groups of oral bacteria was accomplished from both reduced transport fluid and viability-preserving microbistatic medium after 48- and 72-h storage. storage of dental plaque in reduced salt solution proved unsatisfactory for most  bacteria (less than 10% survival). since growth of some bacteria may occur in viability-preserving microbistatic medium and the charcoal present interferes with colonly enumeration on low-dilution plates, we found reduced transport fluid to be the most suitable medium for transport and recovery of bacteria from supragingival dental plaque. subzero storage (-196 and -40 degrees c) did not enhance the survival of bacteria from dental plaque; storage at moderate (5 and 20 degrees c) temperatures gave better recovery of viable bacteria. survival after anaerobic or aerobic storage was comparable for total colony-forming units; however, anaerobic storage enhanced survival of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus. since these organisms are specifically associated with dental caries, anaerobic techniques are preferred for caries activity testing of plaque.

AB  == sucrose metabolism by resting-cell suspensions of pure cultures of representative members of the predominant cultivable flora isolated from cariogenic and non-cariogenic dental plaque was investigated by means of radiochemical techniques. streptocococcus mutans utilized sucrose at a considerably faster rate than s. sanguis, s. mitis, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, or lactobacillus  casei, forming lactic acid, intracellular polysaccharide, insoluble extracellular glucan, and lactic acid from intracellular polysaccharide catabolism at faster rates than the other bacteria. the actinomyces formed more volatile acids than the streptococci, mostly acetic, and s. sanguis formed more soluble extracellular polysaccharide than the other bacteria. the metabolic activity of s. mutans resembled the pattern of sucrose metabolism of cariogenic plaque, whereas the metabolic activity of the actinomyces species, the predominant members of non-cariogenic plaque flora, resembled the sucrose metabolism of non-cariogenic plaques.

TI  == new method for the isolation of streptococcus mutans and its differentiation from other oral streptococci.
AB  == a new, improved agar medium for the isolation of streptococcus mutans, the etiological agent of dental caries, was developed. in contrast to mitis-salivarius agar, this medium not only recovers a greater number of s. mutans strains from most oral specimens but, because of its mannitol and sorbitol content, it also facilitates the differentiation of s. mutans from other oral streptococci, e.g., s. salivarius, s. mitis, and s. sanguis, which do not grow or produce scanty growth only after 10 days of incubation. the medium is easy to prepare because of its simple and unique composition, is characterized by the presence of an acid indicator, and can be utilized under aerobic and anaerobic conditions as well. the medium cannot be used to distinguish among the eight serotypes, a to g and sl-1, of s. mutans. mannitol-utilizing bacteria such as streptococci (e.g., s. faecalis) and other microorganisms (e.g., staphylococcus aureus) are able to grow on this medium and can be distinguished from s. mutans by their unique colony morphology.

TI  == properties of a mutant of streptococcus mutans altered in glucosyltransferase activity.
AB  == a mutant of streptococcus mutans gs-5 has been isolated as a smooth colonial variant on mitis salivarius agar. this mutant, designated sng-1, adheres to glass surfaces as well as the parental organism when grown in the presence of sucrose.  however, in contrast to the parental organism, glucose-grown cultures of the mutant did not adhere to smooth surfaces when incubated with sucrose under nongrowing conditions. the inability of the mutant organism to adhere to glass surfaces under the latter condition was a result to markedly reduced levels of mutant cell-associated glucosyltransferase activity. in addition, the extracellular activity of the mutant was also severely depressed relative to the  parental activity. the reduced levels of mutant enzyme activity appear to be a result of a mutation in a structural gene coding for glucosyltransferase activity since (i) mutant glucosyltransferase activity is much less resistant to heat inactivation compared to the parental enzymes and (ii) the migration patterns of  the mutant and parental enzymes differ on polyacrylamide gels and after isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide gels. however, the kinetic properties of the mutant enzymes are similar to those of the comparable parental activities in  terms of ph and temperature optima and km values for sucrose. the mutant enzyme responsible for soluble glucan synthesis has been purified approximately 300-fold. these results are discussed in terms of the mechanism of glucan synthesis by s. mutans.

AB  == immunoglobulin a (iga) was prepared from samples of parotid saliva collected from two individuals over a 150-day period. standardized solutions of the iga were tested for agglutinating antibody activity against strains of streptococcus salivarius, s. sanguis, s. mitis, and s. mutans that had been isolated from a homologous individual on day 30 and preserved in the lyophilized state. the agglutinating activity of the standardized iga preparations against these strains was found to change over time, whereas the agglutination patterns of iga prepared from saliva samples collected 3 days apart were generally similar. differences in agglutination titers were also observed between iga samples prepared from saliva  collected on day 0 and day 150. the data indicate that the oral cavity may harbor streptococci of different antigenic composition representing the same species at  a given time and that parotid iga agglutinating antibody against these serotypes  changes over time.

TI  == increased selectivity of mitis-salivarius agar containing polymyxin.
AB  == incorporation of the antibiotic polymixin b sulfate in plates of mitis-salivarius medium at a level of 100 u per ml effectively suppressed the growth of gram-negative spreading organisms which occasionally overgrow mitis-salivarius plates of oral samples and make them unsuitable for enumeration and differentiation of streptococci. at the indicated level the antibiotic did not affect the growth or typical colonial characteristics of the oral streptococci.

TI  == immunoelectron microscopic identification and localization of streptococcus sanguis with peroxidase-labeled antibody: localization of surface antigens in pure cultures.
AB  == an indirect method of localizing antigens with horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody was used to identify and localize surface antigens of streptococcus sanguis at the ultrastructural level. an electron dense layer surrounding the cell wall could be distinguished without any additional electron microscope staining. this labeled layer represents an immune complex consisting of bacterial surface antigens, specific rabbit antisera, and peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit globulins. although with undiluted antisera slight cross-reactions occurred with s. salivarius and s. miteor (mitis), these could be readily distinguished from the more intense homologous reaction by their patchiness and the difference in distribution of the label. these cross-reactions were eliminated by appropriate dilutions of the antiserum. no cross-reactions occurred with s. mutans, s. faecalis, actinomyces species, or bacterionema, microorganisms wents indicated that horseradish peroxidase can become non-specifically adsorbed  to the membrane of certain bacterial cells. appropriate controls must, therefore, be included for localization of membrane associated antigens with horseradish peroxidase.

TI  == characteristics of streptococcus milleri and streptococcus mitior from infected dental root canals.
AB  == morphological and physiological characteristics of 103 streptococcal isolates obtained from positive routine cultures of material from dental root canals at filling, were studied. the majority of the isolates were those which at a primary identification not fullfilled the criteria of enterococci, strep. sanguis, strep. mutans or strep. salivarius. only a few representative strains of the latter types were included in the study as a control of the method. the resemblance of the 103 isolates to 38 reference strains were assessed with numerical methods. the isolates formed 9 clusters with reference strains occurring in all but one. of the isolates which it was intended to identify and characterize with numerical taxonomic analysis, all but one joined one of 3 clusters and were identified as strep. milleri or strep. mitior (mitis). the most useful cultural characteristics to dfferentiate the two species were growth on the sulphonamide containing mc-agar and 7.5% bile blood agar by strep. milleri and production of hydrogen peroxide by strep. mitior. the characteristics of the strains in the nine 80-phenons are given in table 2. other characteristics that appeared to be of interest for differentiating strep. milleri from strep. mitior and these two species from other viridans streptococci are underlined in table 2. strep. milleri seems not earlier to have been reported to occur in infected root canals. the occurrence of strep. milleri is in agreement with the data given on serological groups found among streptococcal isolates from routine root canal cultures. little is known about the occurrence and distribution of strep. milleri in the human oral cavity, which therefore warrant further investigations.

TI  == bacteremia after tooth extractions studied with the aid of prereduced anaerobically sterilized culture media.
AB  == both prereduced molten agar and broth and aerobic molten agar and broth were inoculated with blood samples collected from patients with periodontitis, but in  otherwise good health, both before and after extraction of two or more teeth. postoperative blood samples from 23 of 25 patients sampled yielded anaerobic and  facultative species. colony counts from nine samples yielded from less than 1 to  over 100 colonies per ml of blood. organisms detected were species belonging to the genera bacteroides, fusobacterium, peptostreptococcus, leptotrichia, propionibacterium, peptococcus, veillonella, plus streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius, vibrio forms, and strains resembling s. mutans. the data indicate that prereduced anaerobically sterilized culture medium with polyanethol sulfonate is effective for detecting anaerobic species in bacteremia and that anaerobic species can be prevalent in bacteremias immediately after tooth extraction in patients with periodontitis.

TI  == efficiency of various growth media in recovering oral bacterial flora from human  dental plaque.
AB  == mm10 sucrose blood agar (mm10 sb agar), n(2)c agar, schaedler agar (sh agar), and mitis salivarius agar (ms agar) were tested for their ability to recover human dental plaque flora by a continuous anaerobic procedure and by a conventional anaerobic method. mm10 sb agar yielded higher recovery of bacteria from plaque samples as determined by the enumeration of colony-forming units (cfu). the cfu on n(2)c agar, sh agar, and ms agar were lower than mm10 sb agar when the continuous anaerobic procedure was used. the superior performance of mm10 sb agar was much more apparent when used for the cultivation of dental plaque by the conventional anaerobic method. under these conditions the counts were consistently higher on mm10 sb agar as compared to the other media tested. however, the differential counts of streptococcus sanguis and s. mutans from carious plaque samples were in general comparable on all culture media. deletion  of blood from mm10 sb agar did not lower counts. the elimination of dithiothreitol from this medium resulted in a significantly lower recovery of bacteria from the plaque samples when cultured by the conventional anaerobic method. the storage of mm10 sb agar for varying periods of time aerobic conditions did not seem to affect its performance. these findings suggest that mm10 sb agar is an ideal culture medium for the isolation, nonselective enumeration, and differential counts of bacteria present in normal and disease-associated plaques.

TI  == proportional distribution and relative adherence of streptococcus miteor (mitis)  on various surfaces in the human oral cavity.
AB  == a group of streptococci possessing the characteristics of streptococcus miteor (s. mitis) was found to predominate on nonkeratinized human oral mucosa. these organisms averaged from 76 to 89% of the total flora cultivable on anaerobically  incubated blood agar plates from cheek, lip, and ventral tongue surfaces. they averaged 34, 40, and 18% of the streptococci in dental plaque, in saliva, and on  the tongue dorsum, respectively. their ability to adhere to oral surfaces was studied by introducing mixtures of streptomycin-resistant strains of s. miteor, s. salivarius, and s. mutans into the mouths of volunteers. samples of oral surfaces taken 1 hr later indicated s. miteor adhered far better than the other streptococci to buccal mucosa and to teeth, but s. salivarius showed a higher affinity to the tongue dorsum. glucose-grown cells of s. mutans adhered feebly to all oral surfaces studied and were rapidly cleared from the mouth. cells of s. miteor and s. salivarius present naturally in saliva adhered to cleaned teeth comparable to in vitro cultivated strains. electron microscopy of cells of s. miteor attached to buccal epithelial cells obtained from germfree rats indicated  that the organisms possessed a fibrillar "fuzzy" coat which appeared to mediate their attachment to the epithelial cell membrane. this "fuzzy" coat was removed by treatment with trypsin, and it appears to be similar to that previously observed on cells of s. pyogenes and s. salivarius.
