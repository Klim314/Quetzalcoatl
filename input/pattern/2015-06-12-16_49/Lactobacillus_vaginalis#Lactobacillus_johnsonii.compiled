TI  - Characteristics of Lactobacillus and Gardnerella vaginalis from women with or without bacterial vaginosis and their relationships in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - The objectives of the present study were to evaluate in vitro the production of antagonistic compounds against Gardnerella vaginalis by Lactobacillus strains isolated from women with or without bacterial vaginosis (BV), and to select one of the better Lactobacillus producers of such a substance to be tested in vivo using a gnotobiotic animal model challenged with one of the more sensitive G. vaginalis isolates. A total of 24 isolates from women with and without BV were identified as G. vaginalis. A higher frequency (P<0.05) of this bacterium was observed in women with BV (56.7%) when compared to healthy women (17.6%). A total of 86 strains of Lactobacillus were obtained from healthy women and women with BV. Lactobacillus strains were more frequently present (P<0.05) in healthy women (97.5%) than in women with BV (76.7%). Lactobacillus crispatus was the predominating strain in both healthy women and women with BV. Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus vaginalis were isolated with an intermediate frequency in the two groups. In vitro antagonism assays were performed using as indicators 17 reference strains and the G. vaginalis strains isolated from women with BV and from healthy women. Lactobacillus isolated from healthy women showed the higher antagonistic activity against all the indicator strains when compared with isolates from women with BV. Concerning the indicator strains, G. vaginalis found in women with BV was more resistant to the antagonism, particularly when Lactobacillus isolates from women with BV were used as producer strains. A high vaginal population level of G. vaginalis was obtained by intravaginal inoculation of germ-free mice, and this colonization was accompanied by vaginal histopathological lesions. A tenfold decrease in vaginal population level of G. vaginalis and a reduction of histological lesions were observed when the pathogenic challenge was performed in mice previously monoassociated with an L. johnsonii strain. Concluding, results of the present study suggest that progression of G. vaginalis-associated BV depends in part on a simultaneous presence of Lactobacillus populations with a low antagonistic capacity and of a G. vaginalis strain with a high resistance to this antagonism. The results could also explain why G. vaginalis is frequently found in the vaginal ecosystem of healthy women.
TI  - Lactobacillus johnsonii HY7042 ameliorates Gardnerella vaginalis-induced vaginosis by killing Gardnerella vaginalis and inhibiting NF-kappaB activation.
AB  - Hydrogen peroxide-producing lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from women's vaginas and their anti-inflammatory effects against Gardnerella vaginalis-induced vaginosis were examined in beta-estradiol-immunosuppressed mice. Oral and intravaginal treatment with five LABs significantly decreased viable G. vaginalis numbers in vaginal cavities and myeloperoxidase activity in mouse vaginal tissues. Of the LABs examined, Lactobacillus johnsonii HY7042 (LJ) most potently inhibited G. vaginalis-induced vaginosis. This LAB also inhibited the expressions of IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, COX-2, and iNOS, and the activation of NF-kappaB in vaginal tissues, but increased IL-10 expression. Orally administered LJ (0.2x10(8) CFU/mouse) also inhibited the expression of TNF-alpha by 91.7% in beta-estradiol-immunosuppressed mice intraperitoneally injected with LPS. However, it increased IL-10 expression by 63.3% in these mice. Furthermore, LJ inhibited the expressions of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, and the activation of NF-kappaB in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated peritoneal macrophages. LJ also killed G. vaginalis attached with and without HeLa cells. These findings suggest that LJ inhibits bacterial vaginosis by inhibiting the expressions of COX-2, iNOS, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha by regulating NF-kappaB activation and by killing G. vaginalis, and that LJ could ameliorate bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - An in vitro protocol for direct isolation of potential probiotic lactobacilli from raw bovine milk and traditional fermented milks.
AB  - A method for isolating potential probiotic lactobacilli directly from traditional milk-based foods was developed. The novel digestion/enrichment protocol was set up taking care to minimize the protective effect of milk proteins and fats and was validated testing three commercial fermented milks containing well-known probiotic Lactobacillus strains. Only probiotic bacteria claimed in the label were isolated from two out of three commercial fermented milks. The application of the new protocol to 15 raw milk samples and 6 traditional fermented milk samples made it feasible to isolate 11 potential probiotic Lactobacillus strains belonging to Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Lactobacillus vaginalis species. Even though further analyses need to ascertain functional properties of these lactobacilli, the novel protocol set-up makes it feasible to isolate quickly potential probiotic strains from traditional milk-based foods reducing the amount of time required by traditional procedures that, in addition, do not allow to isolate microorganisms occurring as sub-dominant populations.
TI  - Diversity of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in feces of herbivores, omnivores  and carnivores.
AB  - The Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium population in the feces of 26 animals (16 species) were studied by culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. Lactobacilli were detected from a few herbivores, all carnivores and some omnivores. Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus vaginalis and Lactobacillus ingluviei were the most dominant lactobacilli in carnivores. These species were, however, not predominant in herbivores and omnivores. Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus parabuchneri, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, usually present in raw plant material, were present in omnivores but not in carnivores. Bifidobacteria were detected in only four herbivores and two omnivores. Bifidobacterium pseudolongum was the only Bifidobacterium species detected in herbivores. Bifidobacteria detected in the two omnivores are phylogenetically not closely related to known species and are possible novel species in the genus.
TI  - Individual and co-operative roles of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide in the killing activity of enteric strain Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC933 and vaginal strain Lactobacillus gasseri KS120.1 against enteric, uropathogenic and vaginosis-associated pathogens.
AB  - The mechanism underlying the killing activity of Lactobacillus strains against bacterial pathogens appears to be multifactorial. Here, we investigate the respective contributions of hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid in killing bacterial pathogens associated with the human vagina, urinary tract or intestine by two hydrogen peroxide-producing strains. In co-culture, the human intestinal strain Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC933 and human vaginal strain Lactobacillus gasseri KS120.1 strains killed enteric Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344, vaginal Gardnerella vaginalis DSM 4944 and urinary tract Escherichia coli CFT073 pathogens. The cell-free culture supernatants (CFCSs) produced the same reduction in SL1344, DSM 4944 and CFT073 viability, whereas isolated bacteria had no effect. The killing activity of CFCSs was heat-stable. In the presence of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimum essential medium inhibiting the lactic acid-dependent killing activity, CFCSs were less effective at killing of the pathogens. Catalase-treated CFCSs displayed a strong decreased activity. Tested alone, hydrogen peroxide triggered a concentration-dependent killing activity against all three pathogens. Lactic acid alone developed a killing activity only at concentrations higher than that present in CFCSs. In the presence of lactic acid at a concentration present in Lactobacillus CFCSs, hydrogen peroxide displayed enhanced killing activity. Collectively, these results demonstrate that for hydrogen peroxide-producing Lactobacillus strains, the main metabolites of Lactobacillus, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide, act co-operatively to kill enteric, vaginosis-associated and uropathogenic pathogens.
TI  - Vaginal lactobacilli as potential probiotics against Candida SPP.
AB  - Urogenital infections affect millions of people every year worldwide. The treatment of these diseases usually requires the use of antimicrobial agents, and more recently, the use of probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) cultures for the management of vaginal infections has been extensively studied. In this work, 11 vaginal lactobacilli isolates, previously obtained from healthy patients, were studied to screen microorganisms with probiotic properties against Candida spp. The LAB were tested for their ability of auto-aggregation, co-aggregation with C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, and C. tropicalis, adhesion to Caco-2 epithelial cells and production of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). All lactobacilli isolates tested were able to auto-aggregate (ranging from 25.3% to 75.4% assessed at 4 hours of incubation) and to co-aggregate with the four Candida species into different degrees; among them L. crispatus showed the highest scores of co-aggregation. The highest amount of lactic acid was produced by L. salivarius (13.9 g/l), followed by L. johnsonii (6.5 g/l), L. acidophilus (5.5 g/l), and L. jensenii (5.4 g/l). All isolates produced H2O2, but the highest levels (3 - 10 mg/l) were observed for L. acidophilus, L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. johnsonii, and L. vaginalis. Only L. agilis, L. jensenii, L. johnsonii and L. ruminus were able to adhere to epithelial Caco-2 cells. Among the isolates evaluated, L agilis, L. jensenii, L. johnsonii, and L. ruminus exhibited simultaneously several desirable properties as potential probiotic strains justifying future studies to evaluate their technological properties in different pharmaceutical preparations for human use.
TI  - Characterization of dominant cultivable lactobacilli and their antibiotic resistance profiles from faecal samples of weaning piglets.
AB  - AIMS: To examine the lactic acid bacteria flora of weaning piglets, to define the distribution of different lactobacilli species in piglet faecal samples, and to determine the susceptibility phenotype to 11 antibiotic of different families. METHODS AND RESULTS: The faecal samples were taken from piglets with good herd status at 11 and 28 days after weaning. The Lactobacillus isolates (n = 129) from 78 animals housed in pairs in 39 pens were preliminarily identified by their morphology and biochemical characteristics. Partial 16S ribosomal DNA (16S rDNA) was used to identify the isolates to the species level, and RAPD (randomly amplified polymorphism DNA) profiles to differentiate Lactobacillus isolates to the strain level. Based on these studies, 67 strains were selected for antibiotic resistant tests. The most numerous Lactobacillus species found in the piglets was Lactobacillus reuteri (n = 43). Other lactobacilli were L. salivarius (n = 15), L. agilis (n = 4), L. johnsonii (n = 2), L. vaginalis (n = 1), L. mucosae (n = 1) and L. gallinarum (n = 1). All the strains were susceptible to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and gentamicin. Two L. salivarius isolates and two L. reuteri isolates were found to be multiresistant. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the faecal Lactobacillus flora in piglets consists mainly of L. reuteri, L. salivarius and L. acidophilus group lactobacilli, and the distribution of lactobacilli is similar between individuals of the same age and with the same diet. Most of the Lactobacillus isolates tested were sensitive to the antibiotics used in this study. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Valuable information on Lactobacillus species distribution and their antibiotic resistance profiles in piglets is obtained.
TI  - Influence of intensive and extensive breeding on lactic acid bacteria isolated from Gallus gallus domesticus ceca.
AB  - In the present study, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from the cecum of chickens bred  either under intensive (commercial broilers) or extensive (free-range) conditions were isolated, identified and some of their probiotic characteristics determined. The LAB identified by 16S-23S rRNA PCR-ARDRA were mainly of Lactobacillus species and to a lesser extent of Enterococcus spp. for all animals. Free-range chickens showed a higher presence of Lactobacillus acidophilus while Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus johnsonii were more frequently recovered from commercial broilers. Lactobacillus crispatus was found only in commercial broilers, Lactobacillus vaginalis and Lactobacillus agilis only in free-range chickens and Lactobacillus salivarius in both types. Enterococcus isolates from ceca of commercial broilers showed a higher resistance to antimicrobial drugs. Lactobacillus isolates from free-range chickens presented a higher frequency of in vitro antagonistic activity against selected pathogens than from commercial broilers. All LAB isolates had predominantly non-hydrophobic surfaces, but with variations depending on age of the chickens and breeding conditions. Animal breeding caused variation on composition, antimicrobial susceptibility, antagonistic activity and surface hydrophobicity of LAB from chicken cecum. LAB isolates from ceca of free-range chickens have potential as probiotic agents, which may be used in the future as replacing the use of antimicrobials as growth promoters.
TI  - Characterisation of prototype Nurmi cultures using culture-based microbiological  techniques and PCR-DGGE.
AB  - Undefined Nurmi-type cultures (NTCs) have been used successfully to prevent salmonella colonisation in poultry for decades. Such cultures are derived from the caecal contents of specific-pathogen-free birds and are administered via drinking water or spray application onto eggs in the hatchery. These cultures consist of many non-culturable and obligately anaerobic bacteria. Due to their undefined nature it is difficult to obtain approval from regulatory agencies to use these preparations as direct fed microbials for poultry. In this study, 10 batches of prototype NTCs were produced using an identical protocol over a period of 2 years. Traditional microbiological techniques and a molecular culture-independent methodology, polymerase chain reaction combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), were applied to characterise these cultures and also to examine if the constituents of the NTCs were identical. Culture-dependent analysis of these cultures included plating on a variety of selective and semi-selective agars, examination of colony morphology, Gram-staining and a series of biochemical tests (API, BioMerieux, France). Two sets of PCR-DGGE studies were performed. These involved the amplification of universal and subsequently lactic acid bacteria (LAB)-specific hypervariable regions of a 16S rRNA gene by PCR. Resultant amplicons were subjected to DGGE. Sequence analysis was performed on subsequent bands present in resultant DGGE profiles using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). Microbiological culturing techniques tended to isolate common probiotic bacterial species from the genera Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, Clostridium, Escherichia, Pediococcus and Enterobacterium as well as members of the genera, Actinomyces, Bacteroides, Propionibacterium, Capnocytophaga, Proteus, and Klebsiella. Bacteroides, Enterococcus, Escherichia, Brevibacterium, Klebsiella, Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Bacillus, Eubacterium, Serratia, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Pectobacterium and Pantoea spp. in addition to unculturable bacteria were identified as constituents of the NTCs using universal PCR-DGGE analysis. A number of the sequences detected by LAB-specific PCR-DGGE were homologous to those of a number of Lactobacillus spp., including L. fermentum, L. pontis, L. crispatus, L. salivarius, L. casei, L. suntoryeus, L. vaginalis, L. gasseri, L. aviaries, L. johnsonii, L. acidophilus, and L. mucosae in addition to a range of unculturable lactobacilli. While NTCs are successful due to their complexity, the presence of members of Lactobacillus spp. amongst other probiotic genera, in these samples possibly lends to the success of the NTC cultures as probiotics or competitive exclusion products in poultry over the decades. PCR-DGGE proved to be an effective tool in detecting non-culturable organisms present in these complex undefined cultures. In conclusion, while the culture-dependent identification methods or PCR-DGGE alone cannot comprehensively elucidate the bacterial species present in such complex cultures, their complementarity provides useful information on the identity of the constituents of NTCs and will aid in future development of defined probiotics. Moreover, for the purpose of analysing prototype NTCs during their development, PCR-DGGE overcomes the limitations associated with conventional culturing methods including their low sensitivities, inability to detect unculturable bacteria and unknown species, very slow turnabout time and poor reproducibility. This study demonstrated that PCR-DGGE is indeed more valuable in detecting predominant microbial populations between various NTCs than as an identification methodology, being more applicable as a quality control method used to analyse for batch-to-batch variation during NTC production.
TI  - Species-specific oligonucleotide probes for the detection and identification of Lactobacillus isolated from mouse faeces.
AB  - AIMS: To develop species-specific monitoring techniques for rapid detection and identification of Lactobacillus isolated from mouse faeces. METHODS AND RESULTS: The specificity of oligonucleotide probes was evaluated by dot blot hybridization to 16S rDNA and 23S rDNA amplified by PCR from 12 Lactobacillus type strains and 100 strains of Lactobacillus isolated from mouse faeces. Oligonucleotide probes specific for each Lactobacillus species hybridized only with targeted rDNA. The Lactobacillus strains isolated from mouse faeces were identified mainly as Lactobacillus intestinalis, L. johnsonii, L. murinus and L. reuteri using species-specific probes. 16S rDNA of eight unidentified isolates were sequenced and two new probes were designed. Four of eight strains of unhybridized Lactobacillus were identified as L. johnsonii/gasseri group, and the remaining four strains as L. vaginalis. CONCLUSIONS: The species-specific probe set of L. intestinalis, L. johnsonii, L. murinus, L. reuteri and L. vaginalis in this study was efficient for rapid identification of Lactobacillus isolated from mouse faeces. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The oligonucleotide probe set for Lactobacillus species harboured in the mouse intestine, can be used for rapid identification of lactobacilli and monitoring of the faecal Lactobacillus community.
