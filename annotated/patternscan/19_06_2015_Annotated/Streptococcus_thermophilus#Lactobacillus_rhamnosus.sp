TI  == a combination of probiotics and whey proteins enhances anti-obesity effects of calcium and dairy products during nutritional energy restriction in ap2-agouti transgenic mice.
AB  == lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus paracasei tmc0409, streptococcus thermophilus tmc1543 and whey proteins were used to prepare fermented milk. for the experiment ap2- agouti transgenic mice were pre-treated with a high-sucrose/high-fat diet for 6 weeks to induce obesity. the obese mice were fed a diet containing 1.2 % ca and either non-fat dried milk (nfdm) or probiotic-fermented milk (pfm) with nutritional energy restriction for 6 weeks. the animals were examined after the treatment for changes in body weight, fat pad weight, fatty acid synthase (fas) activity, lypolysis, the expression levels of genes related to lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity in adipocytes and skeletal muscle and the presence of biomarkers for oxidative and inflammatory stress in plasma. it was found that the pfm diet significantly reduced body weight, fat accumulation, and adipocyte fas activity, and increased adipocyte lipolysis as compared with the effects of the nfdm diet (p< 0.05). the adipose tissue gene expression of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11beta-hsd1) was significantly suppressed in mice that were fed pfm as compared with those that were fed nfdm (p< 0.05). pfm caused a greater up-regulation of skeletal muscle pparalpha, ppardelta, uncoupling protein 3 (ucp3) and glut4 expression and a significant decrease in the plasma concentration of insulin, malondialdehyde, tnf-alpha, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and c-reactive protein as compared with the effects of nfdm (p< 0.05). fermentation of milk with selected probiotics and  supplementation of milk with whey proteins may thus enhance anti-obesity effects  of ca and dairy products by the suppression of adipose tissue lipogenesis, activation of fat oxidation in skeletal muscle and reduction of oxidative and inflammatory stress.

TI  == biodiversity and gamma-aminobutyric acid production by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional alpine raw cow's milk cheeses.
AB  == "nostrano-cheeses" are traditional alpine cheeses made from raw cow's milk in trentino-alto adige, italy. this study identified lactic acid bacteria (lab) developing during maturation of "nostrano-cheeses" and evaluated their potential  to produce gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba), an immunologically active compound and neurotransmitter. cheese samples were collected on six cheese-making days, in three dairy factories located in different areas of trentino and at different stages of cheese ripening (24 h, 15 days, and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 months). a total  of 1,059 lab isolates were screened using random amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and differentiated into 583 clusters. lab strains from dominant clusters (n = 97) were genetically identified to species level by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. lab species most frequently isolated were lactobacillus paracasei, streptococcus thermophilus, and leuconostoc mesenteroides. the 97 dominant clusters were also characterized for their ability in producing gaba by  high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). about 71% of the dominant bacteria clusters evolving during cheeses ripening were able to produce gaba. most gaba producers were lactobacillus paracasei but other gaba producing species included  lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, pediococcus pentosaceus, and streptococcus thermophilus. no enterococcus faecalis or sc. macedonicus isolates produced gaba. the isolate producing the highest amount of gaba (80.0+/-2.7 mg/kg) was a sc. thermophilus.

TI  == molecular characterization of lactobacillus plantarum dmdl 9010, a strain with efficient nitrite degradation capacity.
AB  == nitrites commonly found in food, especially in fermented vegetables, are potential carcinogens. therefore, limiting nitrites in food is critically important for food safety. a lactobacillus strain (lactobacillus sp. dmdl 9010) was previously isolated from fermented vegetables by our group, and is not yet fully characterized. a number of phenotypical and genotypical approaches were employed to characterize lactobacillus sp. dmdl 9010. its nitrite degradation capacity was compared with four other lactobacillus strains, including lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus 719, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricu 1.83, streptococcus thermophilus 1.204, and lactobacillus plantarum 8140, on mrs medium. compared to these four lactobacillus strains, lactobacillus  sp. dmdl 9010 had a significantly higher nitrite degradation capacity (p<0.001).  based on 16s rdna sequencing and sequence comparison, lactobacillus sp. dmdl 9010 was identified as either lactobacillus plantarum or lactobacillus pentosus. to further identify this strain, the flanking regions (922 bp and 806 bp upstream and downstream, respectively) of the l-lactate dehydrogenase 1 (l-ldh1) gene were amplified and sequenced. lactobacillus sp. dmdl 9010 had 98.92 and 76.98% sequence identity in the upstream region with l. plantarum wcfs1 and l. pentosus  ig1, respectively, suggesting that lactobacillu sp. dmdl 9010 is an l. plantarum  strain. it was therefore named l. plantarum dmdl 9010. our study provides a platform for genetic engineering of l. plantarum dmdl 9010, in order to further improve its nitrite degradation capacity.

TI  == local probiotic therapy for vaginal candida albicans infections.
AB  == the high rate of vaginal candida albicans recurrence is attributed to azole resistance rates as high as 15 %. the aim of this study was to determine the clinical and microbiological efficacy of standard azole therapy for treatment of  vaginal c. albicans infection alone and in combination with local probiotic as well as the effects on vaginal microbiota. this study included 436 women with vaginal candidiasis randomly assigned to two treatment groups. the first group, with 207 patients (12 dropouts), was administered 150 mg fluconazole and a single vaginal globule of fenticonazole (600 mg) on the same day. the second group of 209 patients (8 dropouts) followed the same treatment schedule; however, ten applications of a vaginal probiotic containing lactobacillus acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, streptococcus thermophilus, and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus were  also administered beginning the fifth day after azole treatment. microbiological  analysis of the therapy efficacy in the first treatment group showed c. albicans  resistance in over 30 % of patients. clinical complaints persisted after treatment administration in 79.7 % (n = 165) of women in this group. clinical complaints in the second group decreased to 31.1 % (n = 65) and microbiological efficacy also improved among investigated parameters, from 93.7 % (n = 193) to 95.2 % (n = 198). the local application of probiotics after administration of combined azoles for treatment of vaginal c. albicans infections increases therapy efficacy and could prevent relapse.

TI  == probiotics for preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  == background: ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is common in intensive care units (icus). some evidence indicates that probiotics may reduce the incidence of vap. several additional published studies have demonstrated that probiotics are safe and efficacious in preventing vap in icus. we aimed to systematically summarise the results of all available data to generate the best evidence for the prevention of vap. objectives: to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for preventing vap. search methods: we searched central (2014, issue 8), medline (1948 to september week 1, 2014) and embase (2010 to september 2014). selection criteria: randomised controlled trials (rcts) comparing probiotics with placebo or another control (excluding rcts that use probiotics in both study groups) to prevent vap. data collection and analysis: two review authors independently assessed eligibility and the quality of trials, and extracted data. main results: we included eight rcts, with 1083 participants. all studies compared a form of probiotic (lactobacillus casei rhamnosus; lactobacillus plantarum; synbiotic 2000forte; ergyphilus; combination bifidobacterium longum +  lactobacillus bulgaricus + streptococcus thermophilus) versus a control group (placebo; glutamine; fermentable fibre; peptide; chlorhexidine). the analysis of  all rcts showed that the use of probiotics decreased the incidence of vap (odds ratio (or) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.52 to 0.95, low quality evidence). however, the aggregated results were uncertain for icu mortality (or 0.84, 95% ci 0.58 to 1.22 very low quality evidence), in-hospital mortality (or 0.78, 95% ci 0.54 to 1.14, very low quality evidence), incidence of diarrhoea (or 0.72, 95% ci 0.47 to 1.09, very low quality evidence), length of icu stay (mean difference (md) -1.60, 95% ci -6.53 to 3.33, very low quality evidence), duration of mechanical ventilation (md -6.15, 95% ci -18.77 to 6.47, very low quality evidence) and antibiotic use (or 1.23, 95% ci 0.51 to 2.96, low quality evidence). antibiotics for vap were used for a shorter duration (in days) when participants received probiotics in one small study (md -3.00, 95% ci -6.04 to 0.04). however, the ci of the estimated effect was too wide to exclude no difference with probiotics. there were no reported events of nosocomial probiotic infections in any included study.the overall methodological quality of the included studies, based on our 'risk of bias' assessments, was moderate with half of the included studies rated as a 'low' risk of bias; however, we rated four included studies as a 'high' risk of bias across one or more of the domains. the  study limitations, differences in probiotics administered and participants, and small sample sizes across the included studies mean that the power to detect a trend of overall effect may be limited and chance findings cannot be excluded.to  explore the influence of some potential confounding factors in the studies, we conducted an intention-to-treat (itt) analysis, which did not change the inference of per-protocol analysis. however, our sensitivity analysis did not indicate a significant difference between groups for instances of vap. authors' conclusions: evidence suggests that use of probiotics is associated with a reduction in the incidence of vap. however, the quality of the evidence is low and the exclusion of the one study that did not provide a robust definition of vap increased the uncertainty in this finding. the available evidence is not clear regarding a decrease in icu or hospital mortality with probiotic use. three trials reported on the incidence of diarrhoea and the pooled results indicate no  clear evidence of a difference. the results of this meta-analysis do not provide  sufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the efficacy and safety of probiotics  for the prevention of vap in icu patients.

TI  == short-term probiotic therapy alleviates small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, but does not improve intestinal permeability in chronic liver disease.
AB  == aim: : although numerous animal studies suggest that probiotic therapy has beneficial effects in various liver diseases, the evidence for beneficial effects in human liver disease is controversial. this study was carried out to investigate the efficacy of probiotic therapy in alleviating small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (sibo) and permeability in chronic liver disease. methods: fifty-three patients with chronic liver disease were randomized to either probiotic therapy or placebo. six bacterial species were used: bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and streptococcus thermophilus. after 4 weeks, changes in the composition of fecal bacteria, sibo, intestinal permeability, and clinical symptoms were examined. results: three of the six probiotic species, b. lactis, l. rhamnosus, and l. acidophilus, increased in the  feces of the probiotic therapy group (p<0.001), whereas there was no change in fecal microbiota in the placebo group. sibo disappeared in many individuals of the probiotic therapy group, but none in the placebo (24 vs. 0%, p<0.05). general gastrointestinal symptoms also improved more in the probiotic group and improvement in intestinal permeability was slightly but not significantly more frequent in the probiotic arm than the placebo arm (50 vs. 31.3%, p=0.248). numbers of lactobacilli in stool were correlated negatively with intestinal permeability (p for trend<0.05). liver chemistry did not improve significantly in either group. conclusions: we conclude that short-term probiotic administration in chronic liver disease is effective in alleviating sibo and clinical symptoms,  but ineffective in improving intestinal permeability and liver function.

TI  == synbiotic in the management of infantile colic: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  == aim: infant colic is a frequent problem affecting up to 10-30% of infants in first 3 months of life. results from previous trials have shown that manipulation of gut microbiota can lead to symptomatic improvements. in a randomised clinical  trial, we aimed to determine efficacy of synbiotic in reducing average infant crying time at day 7 and day 30 after starting intervention. methods: fifty breastfed infants aged 15-120 days with infantile colic randomly assigned to receive either the synbiotic sachet containing 1 billion cfu of: lactobacillus casei, l. rhamnosus, streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium breve, l. acidophilus, b. infantis, l. bulgaricus and fructooligosacharide (protexin healthcare, somerset, uk), or placebo daily for 30 days. parents were asked to record details of crying times in a symptoms diary. the primary outcome measure was the treatment success (reduction in the daily crying time >50%) and the secondary outcome measure was symptom resolution (reduction in the daily crying time >90%). results: the treatment success was significantly higher in synbiotic  group (82.6%) compared with placebo (35.7%) at day 7 (p < 0.005). at day30, treatment success was 87% and 46% in synbiotic and placebo group, respectively (p < 0.01). symptom resolution was also higher in synbiotic group (39%) compared with placebo (7%) at day 7 (p < 0.03) but not at day 30 (56% vs.36%, p = 0.24). we encountered no complication related to synbiotic use. conclusion: this synbiotic (a mixture of seven probiotic strains plus fos) significantly improved  colic symptoms in comparison with placebo.

TI  == production of folate in oat bran fermentation by yeasts isolated from barley and  diverse foods.
AB  == aims: the focus of the research was to identify yeasts from barley kernels in order to study their folate production capability while maintaining high viscosity caused by soluble fibres in oat bran fermentation. methods and results: the 65 isolated yeasts were characterized by api carbohydrate utilization tests,  and assays for extracellular enzyme activities were the following: amylase, beta-glucanase, cellulase or cmcase, lipase, protease and xylanase. yeasts were identified by partial dna sequencing of the 25s d1/d2 and its1-5.8s-its2 regions. they belonged to the genera aureobasidium, cryptococcus, pseudozyma and rhodotorula. folate production was determined from supernatant and cells grown in a rich laboratory medium or directly from oat bran solution inoculated with the appropriate yeast. food yeasts, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida milleri, kluyveromyces marxianus and galactomyces geotrichum, were used for comparison. most of the yeasts isolated from barley destroyed the solid, viscous structure of the oat bran solution, indicating that they degraded the viscosity-generating soluble fibres, considered to be nutritionally advantageous. the best folate producers were s. cerevisiae, followed by pseudozyma sp., rhodotorula glutinis and k. marxianus. the yeasts maintaining high viscosity were used together with lactic acid bacteria (lab) streptococcus thermophilus or lactobacillus rhamnosus  to ferment oat bran solution. none of the yeasts isolated from barley, contrary to s. cerevisiae and c. milleri, produced together with lab significant amounts of folate. conclusions: fermentative yeasts together with lab are potential for use in developing novel high folate content healthy foods and snacks from oat bran. significance and impact of the study: high soluble fibre content and high natural folate content but low energy content food and snack products with pleasant fermentation aroma provide possibilities for new developments in the food industry.

TI  == effect of bacterial cell-free supernatants on infectivity of norovirus surrogates.
AB  == bacterial metabolic products were evaluated for inhibitory effects on viral propagation in cell culture. cell-free supernatants (cfs) were prepared from growth of enterococcus faecalis atcc 19433, pseudomonas fluorescens atcc 13525, escherichia coli 08, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, bacillus subtilis 168, bacillus coagulans 185a, b. coagulans 7050, clostridium sporogenes pa3679, and a commercial probiotic mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium bifidum, lactobacillus salivarius, and streptococcus thermophilus in microbiological medium or milk. the inhibitory effects of cfs on  the propagation of murine norovirus 1 and tulane virus in raw 264.7 and llcmk2 cells, respectively, were evaluated in the continuous presence of cfs or after exposure of host cells to cfs. slight inhibition of viral propagation was observed for murine norovirus and tulane virus in the continuous presence of cfs  of b. subtilis 168 and e. faecalis 19433, respectively. cfs cytotoxicity was also determined by microscopic examination. virus persisted in the cfs that demonstrated cytotoxic effects, suggesting a lack of direct effect of cfs on virions. the viral propagation indicates a general lack of competitive inhibition by bacterial extracellular products and bears significance in understanding the persistence of virus in food and human systems shared by bacteria that are recognized for their colonization and competitive capabilities.

TI  == evaluation of probiotic survivability in yogurt exposed to cold chain interruption.
AB  == in this research, the survival of probiotic microorganisms in yogurts stored at room temperature (cold chain interruption conditions) was studied. milk inoculated with yogurt bacteria (mixed culture of streptococcus thermophilus and  lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus) and a single probiotic culture (l. acidophilus la-5 or bifidobacterium lactis bb- 12 or l. rhamnosus hn001 or l. paracasei lpc-37) were incubated till ph of 4.5 was reached. probiotic yogurts were stored at two different temperatures including cold (control) and room temperatures (5 and 20 degrees c, respectively). changes in ph decrease, titratable acidity increase and redox potential increase as well as the viability of probiotics per 6 h intervals during an assumptive interrupted cold storage (24 h) were monitored. the survival of probiotics was strongly dependent on the storage temperature and remarkable viability loss occurred in room temperature compared to refrigerated storage. in addition, the survivability was dependent on probiotic strain. among our experimental strains, b. lactis bb-12 showed the less resistance to be stored at 20 degrees c (24 h) and referring to the recommended minimum numbers of 10(7) cfu ml(-) (1), l. rhamnosus hn001 was the most suitable  probiotic strain to be used in probiotic yogurts especially in countries having high possibility of cold chain interruption during storage.

TI  == use of microparticulated whey protein concentrate, exopolysaccharide-producing streptococcus thermophilus, and adjunct cultures for making low-fat italian caciotta-type cheese.
AB  == low-fat caciotta-type cheeses were manufactured with partially skim milk (fat content of ~0.3%) alone (lfc); with the supplementation of 0.5% (wt/vol) microparticulated whey protein concentrate (mwpc) (lfc-mwpc); with mwpc and exopolysaccharides (eps)-producing streptococcus thermophilus st446 (lfc-mwpc-eps); and with mwpc, eps-producing strain st446, and lactobacillus plantarum lp and lactobacillus rhamnosus lra as adjunct cultures (lfc-mwpc-eps-a). the non-eps-producing isogenic variant streptococcus thermophilus st042 was used for making full-fat caciotta-type cheese (ffc), lfc,  and lfc-mwpc. cheeses were characterized based on compositional, microbiological, biochemical, texture, volatile components (purge and trap, and solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry), and sensory analyses. compared with ffc and lfc (51.6 +/- 0.7 to 53.0 +/- 0.9%), the other cheese variants retained higher levels of moisture (60.5 +/- 1.1 to 67.5 +/- 0.5%). the mwpc mainly contributed to moisture retention. overall, all lfc had approximately one-fourth (22.6 +/- 0.8%) of the fat of ffc. hardness of cheeses slightly varied over 7d of ripening. microbial eps positively affected cheese texture, and the texture of lfc without mwpc or microbial eps was excessively firm. free amino acids were at the highest levels in lfc treatments (2,705.8 +/-  122 to 3,070.4 +/- 123 mg/kg) due to the addition of mwpc and the peptidase activity of adjunct cultures. aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, sulfur compounds, and short- to medium-chain carboxylic acids differentiated lfc variants and ffc. the  sensory attributes pleasant to taste, intensity of flavor, overall acceptability, and pleasant to chew variously described lfc-mwpc-eps and lfc-mwpc-eps-a. based on the technology options used, low-fat caciotta-type cheese (especially ripened  for 14 d) has promising features to be further exploited as a suitable alternative to the full-fat variant.

TI  == effect of prebiotic carbohydrates on growth, bile survival and cholesterol uptake abilities of dairy-related bacteria.
AB  == background: three strains of lactic acid bacteria and one probiotic bifidobacterium strain sourced from milk origin were considered to select for the best synbiotic-like combination for cholesterol uptake ability. for that purpose, fermentative characteristics, bile salt hydrolase activity, bile survival and cholesterol removal were assessed in the presence of different carbohydrates. results: carbohydrate fermentability was highly variable among the different strains, and lactulose was the only prebiotic to favour growth of all strains, whereas pectin led to low population regardless of the strain. bile survival of bacteria could be improved by the preferred carbon source and was related to their bile salt hydrolase activities. all together, our results showed that the most advantageous synbiotic-like combinations to achieve cholesterol uptake abilities were lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus lb 340 with raffinose, streptococcus thermophilus ta040 or lactobacillus rhamnosus lbre-lsas with lactulose, and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb12 with mannitol. conclusion: the suggested synbiotics may represent new promising functional dairy additives.

TI  == utilization of major fucosylated and sialylated human milk oligosaccharides by isolated human gut microbes.
AB  == human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) are not digested in the proximal intestine. in distal intestine, hmos collectively modify the microbiota, but the response of individual bacteria to individual components of the hmos is not well defined. here, each of 25 major isolates of the human intestinal microbiota was fed individual major fucosylated and sialylated hmos in anaerobic culture. this allowed for an assessment of the influence of specific hmos on the growth and metabolic products of individual microbiota bacteria. most bifidobacteria spp. and bacteroides spp. grew, induced alpha-l-fucosidase activity, and produced abundant lactate or short-chain fatty acids (scfas) when fed 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-fl), 3-fl, and lactodifucotetraose (ldft). lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc7830, enterococcus faecalis atcc19433, and streptococcus thermophilus atcc19258 exhibited slight growth, ph reduction, and lactate production when supplemented with 2'-fl or 3-fl, but not ldft. supplementation with 3'-sialyllactose (3'-sl) and 6'-sl promoted moderate growth of bifidobacterium longum jcm7007, 7009, 7010, 7011, 1272, 11347, atcc15708, bacteroides vulgatus atcc8482, and b. thetaiotaomicron atcc29148; accordingly, these bacteria exhibited greater neuraminidase activity and produced copious lactate, scfa, or both. lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc7830 also consumed 6'-sl. in contrast, clostridium spp., l. rhamnosus atcc53103, e. faecalis atcc29200, staphylococcus spp., enterobacter spp., and escherichia coli k12 did not consume milk oligosaccharides nor produce appreciable acidic fermentation products. specific bifidobacteria and bacteroides differentially digest specific individual hmos, with the major fucosylated milk oligosaccharides most strongly stimulating key species of mutualist symbionts. this suggests strategies for treating dysbiosis of the microbiota and associated inflammatory disorders.

TI  == significant effect of ca2+ on improving the heat resistance of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the heat resistance of lactic acid bacteria (lab) has been extensively investigated due to its highly practical significance. reconstituted skim milk (rsm) has been found to be one of the most effective protectant wall materials for microencapsulating microorganisms during convective drying, such as spray drying. in addition to proteins and carbohydrate, rsm is rich in calcium. it is not clear which component is critical in the rsm protection mechanism. this study investigated the independent effect of calcium. ca(2+) was added to lactose solution to examine its influence on the heat resistance of lactobacillus rhamnosus zy, lactobacillus casei zhang, lactobacillus plantarum p8 and streptococcus thermophilus nd03. the results showed that certain ca(2+) concentrations enhanced the heat resistance of the lab strains to different extents, that is produced higher survival and shorter regrowth lag times of the bacterial cells. in some cases, the improvements were dramatic. more scientifically insightful and more intensive instrumental study of the ca(2+) behavior around and in the cells should be carried out in the near future. in the meantime, this work may lead to the development of more cost-effective wall materials with ca(2+) added as a prime factor.

AB  == background: several studies have suggested that probiotics (prob) and/or prebiotics (preb) could reduce the burden of infection in infants and toddlers. we aimed to determine whether follow-up formula supplemented with prob and preb could reduce the risk of acute otitis media (aom). methods: in this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial from november 2007 to april 2009, 37 pediatricians in france enrolled children 7 to 13 months of age with high risk of aom who were randomly assigned to receive follow-up formula supplemented with prob (streptococcus thermophilus ncc 2496, streptococcus salivarius dsm 13084, lactobacillus rhamnosus lpr cgmcc 1.3724) and preb (raftilose/raftiline) or follow-up formula alone (placebo). during 12 months, the 2 groups were compared for number of aom episodes diagnosed (primary outcome) and secondary outcomes by  the poisson model (incidence rate ratio [irr]) or logistic regression (odds ratio; and 95% confidence interval [95% ci]) after adjustment on covariates of interest. results: we enrolled 224 children (112 in each group). all children were vaccinated (4 doses) with the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; demographic characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. in total, 486 aom episodes were reported, 249 and 237 in the treatment and control groups, respectively. the treatment and control groups did not differ in incidence of aom (irr 1.0, 95% ci: 0.8-1.2), lower respiratory tract infections (irr 0.9, 0.7-1.2) or number of antibiotic treatment courses (irr = 1.0, 95% ci: 0.8-1.2). treatment was not associated with recurrent aom (odds ratio 1.0, 95% ci: 0.5-1.7). with regard to gastrointestinal disorders, both formulas were well tolerated. conclusion: the prob and preb included in follow-up formula given to children at  7 to 13 months of age did not reduce the risk of aom, recurrent aom, antibiotic use or lower respiratory tract infections at 1 year.

TI  == the viability and intestinal epithelial cell adhesion of probiotic strain combination--in vitro study.
AB  == to be effective, probiotic bacteria must exhibit a number of functional characteristics, including the resistance to gastric acidity and the ability to adhere to the intestinal epithelium. in this study, we examined in vitro the viability of lactic acid bacteria (lab) combination after exposure to low ph, and the adhesion of lab to caco-2 cells during coincubation of 9 bacterial strains. to test bacterial viability, 6 commercially available products were incubated in  0.1 n hcl at ph 1.2 for 60 min. the greatest growth inhibition was noted for the  non-capsulated product containing the lactobacillus rhamnosus strain (log reduction of cfu = 6.4), and the best survival observed for the product containing 9 bacterial strains, equipped with a modern capsule made according to  the multi-resistant encapsulation technology (log reduction of cfu = 0.1). in the adhesion experiment, the combination of 9 bacterial strains was added to 17-day-old caco-2 cell culture for 90 min. the greatest efficiency of adhesion was observed for the inoculum containing 5.5x10(8) cfu/ml/9.6 cm(2) of caco-2 and the dose of probiotic bacteria of 190 cells per one caco-2 cell. as a result, approximately 157 bacterial cells adhered to one caco-2 cell. the results indicate that the combination of 9 bacterial strains in the examined product is characterized as highly adhesive.

TI  == manufacture of fior di latte cheese by incorporation of probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == this work aimed to select heat-resistant probiotic lactobacilli to be added to fior di latte (high-moisture cow milk mozzarella) cheese. first, 18 probiotic strains belonging to lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus reuteri were screened. resistance to heating (65 or  55 degrees c for 10 min) varied markedly between strains. adaptation at 42 degrees c for 10 min increased the heat resistance at 55 degrees c for 10 min of  all probiotic lactobacilli. heat-adapted l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees c of 227.4 min) and l. paracasei bgp1 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees c of 40.8 min) showed the highest survival  under heat conditions that mimicked the stretching of the curd and were used for  the manufacture of fior di latte cheese. two technology options were chosen: chemical (addition of lactic acid to milk) or biological (streptococcus thermophilus as starter culture) acidification with or without addition of probiotics. as determined by random amplified polymorphic dna-pcr and 16s rrna gene analyses, the cell density of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 and l. paracasei bgp1 in chemically or biologically acidified fior di latte cheese was approximately 8.0 log(10)cfu/g. microbiological, compositional, biochemical, and  sensory analyses (panel test by 30 untrained judges) showed that the use of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 and l. paracasei bgp1 enhanced flavor formation and shelf-life of fior di latte cheeses.

TI  == cytokine profile and induction of t helper type 17 and regulatory t cells by human peripheral mononuclear cells after microbial exposure.
AB  == the immunomodulatory effects of probiotics were assessed following exposure of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc), cord blood cells and the spleen-derived monocyte/macrophage cell line crl-9850 to lactobacillus acidophilus lavri-a1, lb. rhamnosus gg, exopolysaccharides (eps)-producing streptococcus thermophilus st1275, bifidobacteriun longum bl536, b. lactis b94 and escherichia coli tg1 strains. the production of a panel of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines by pbmc following bacterial stimulation was measured, using live, heat-killed or mock gastrointestinal tract (git)-exposed bacteria, and results show that (i) all bacterial strains investigated induced significant  secretion of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines from pbmc-derived monocytes/macrophages; and (ii) cytokine levels increased relative to the expansion of bacterial cell numbers over time for cells exposed to live cultures. bifidobacteria and s. thermophilus stimulated significant concentrations of transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta, an interleukin necessary for the differentiation of regulatory t cells (t(reg) )/t helper type 17 (th17) cells and, as such, the study further examined the induction of th17 and t(reg) cells after pbmc exposure to selected bacteria for 96 h. data show a significant increase in the numbers of both cell types in the exposed populations, measured by cell surface marker expression and by cytokine production. probiotics have been shown to induce cytokines from a range of immune cells following ingestion of these organisms. these studies suggest that probiotics' interaction with immune-competent cells produces a cytokine milieu, exerting immunomodulatory effects on local effector cells, as well as potently inducing differentiation of  th17 and t(reg) cells.

TI  == the effect of a multispecies probiotic mixture on the symptoms and fecal microbiota in diarrhea-dominant irritable bowel syndrome: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == background: the clinical effect of probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is still controversial. aims: we aimed to evaluate the effects of a probiotic mixture on ibs symptoms and the composition of fecal microbiota in patients with  diarrhea-dominant ibs (d-ibs). methods: fifty patients with d-ibs were randomized into placebo or probiotic mixture (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, and streptococcus thermophilus 1.0x10 cfu) groups. treatment was taken daily for 8 weeks. the primary outcome was adequate relief (ar) of overall ibs symptoms, which was assessed weekly for 10 weeks. a responder was defined as a patient who experienced ar for at least half of the 10-week study period. secondary outcomes included the effects on individual symptoms, stool parameters, and ibs quality of life. the fecal flora compositions were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). results: the proportion of ar was consistently higher in  the probiotics group than in the placebo group throughout the 10-week period (p<0.05). the proportion of responders was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group (48% vs. 12%, p=0.01). stool consistency improved significantly in the probiotics group compared with the placebo group. percent changes in individual symptom scores were similar in the 2 groups, but ibs quality of life improvement tended to be higher in the probiotics group. comparison of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles of fecal flora showed that the concordance rate between bacterial compositions before and after  treatment was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group (69.5% vs. 56.5%, p=0.005). conclusions: the probiotic mixture was effective in providing ar of overall ibs symptoms and improvement of stool consistency in d-ibs patients, although it had no significant effect on individual symptoms. the therapeutic effect of probiotics is associated with the  stabilization of intestinal microbiota.

TI  == the fate of indigenous microbiota, starter cultures, escherichia coli, listeria innocua and staphylococcus aureus in danish raw milk and cheeses determined by pyrosequencing and quantitative real time (qrt)-pcr.
AB  == the purpose of this work was to study the bacterial communities in raw milk and in danish raw milk cheeses using pyrosequencing of tagged amplicons of the v3 and v4 regions of the 16s rdna and cdna. furthermore, the effects of acidification and ripening starter cultures, cooking temperatures and rate of acidification on  survival of added escherichia coli, listeria innocua and staphylococcus aureus in cheeses at different stages of ripening were studied by pyrosequencing and quantitative real time (qrt)-pcr. a high diversity of bacterial species was detected in raw milk. lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus rhamnosus were the main bacteria detected in raw milk and cheeses. bacteria belonging to the genera brevibacterium, staphylococcus, escherichia, weissella, leuconostoc, pediococcus were also detected in both 16s rdna and cdna obtained from raw milk and cheeses. e. coli, which was added to milk used for production of some cheeses, was detected in both dna and rna extracted from cheeses at different stages of ripening showing the highest percentage of the total sequence reads at 7 days of ripening and decreased again in the later ripening stages. growth of e. coli in cheeses appeared to be affected by the cooking temperature and the rate of acidification  but not by the ripening starter cultures applied or the indigenous microbiota of  raw milk. growth of l. innocua and s. aureus added to milks was inhibited in all  cheeses at different stages of ripening. the use of 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing  and qrt-pcr allows a deeper understanding of the behavior of indigenous microbiota, starter cultures and pathogenic bacteria in raw milk and cheeses.

TI  == probiotics can induce follicle maturational competence: the danio rerio case.
AB  == in the present study, the effects of the probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus imc 501 on the acquisition of oocyte maturational competence was examined in zebrafish (danio rerio). l. rhamnosus administration induced the responsiveness of incompetent follicles (stage iiia) to 17,20-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one and their in vitro maturation. acquisition of competence by the stage iiia follicles  was further validated by changes of lhr, mprb, inhbaa (activin betaa1), tgfb1, and gdf9 gene expression, which have recently emerged as key regulators of oocyte acquisition of maturational competence, and pou5f1 gene expression, which in other models has been shown to govern the establishment of developmental competence of oocytes. in addition, a dna microarray experiment was conducted using the same follicles, and with relative gene ontology (go) data analysis, the molecular effects of probiotic administration emerged. molecular analysis using pcr-dgge (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) approach, providing information about only the most abundant bacterial members of the microbial community, revealed that the probiotic was able to populate the gastrointestinal  tract and modulate the microbial communities, causing a clear shift in them and specifically enhancing the presence of the lactic acid bacteria streptococcus thermophilus. at the same time, pcr-dgge analysis revealed that the probiotic was not directly associated with the ovaries. finally, the effects of probiotic treatment on zebrafish follicle development were also analyzed by fpa (focal plane array) fourier transform-infrared (ft-ir) imaging, a technique that provides the overall biochemical composition of samples. changes were found above all in stage iiia follicles from probiotic-exposed females; the modifications, observed in protein secondary structures as well as in hydration and in bands related to phosphate moieties, allowed us to hypothesize that probiotics act at this follicle stage, affecting the maturation phase.

TI  == probiotics for prevention and treatment of diarrhea.
AB  == probiotics have been extensively studied over the past several years in the prevention and, to a larger extent, in the treatment of diarrheal diseases, especially in pediatric populations. diarrhea is a symptom, and not a disease. this review will not address chronic disorders associated with diarrhea, or clostridium difficile-induced diarrhea. rather it will focus on published clinical trials performed on acute-onset, likely infectious diarrhea occurring in the settings of day-care centers, in the community, acquired in the hospital, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and treatment of acute infectious diarrhea. for prevention of diarrhea acquired in day-care centers, 9 randomized and placebo-controlled trials have been published, conducted in different parts of the world. probiotics tested were lactobacillus gg, bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with streptococcus thermophilus, and lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus (not gg), and lactobacillus acidophilus, in various trials either alone or in comparison with each other. the evidence of their efficacy in these settings is only modest for the prevention of diarrhea, although somewhat better for prevention of upper respiratory infections. in the community, new trails conducted in underprivileged areas of india, again with modest efficacy. previous trials that examined the potential role of probiotics in preventing the spreading of diarrhea in hospitalized children had yielded conflicting results. more recently, a large trial in poland showed, however, rather good evidence of efficacy for lactobacillus gg. the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea has been the subject of many investigations, both  in children and in adults. most commonly used probiotics were lactobacillus gg, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium ssp, streptococcus ssp, and the yeast saccharomyces boulardii. in general, most of these trials do show clear evidence of efficacy, with the 2 most effective strains being lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii. evidence is also emerging on the importance of the dose in reducing the incidence of this type of diarrhea, and the incidence of clostridium difficile-associated postantibiotic diarrhea. as for treatment, a large body of data is available, especially in children, on the effect of several strains of probiotics in treating sporadic infectious diarrhea. the vast majority of the published trials show a statistically significant benefit and moderate clinical benefit of a few, well-identified probiotic strains-mostly lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii-in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea, and particularly those due to rotavirus. such a beneficial effect results, on average, in a reduction of diarrhea duration of approximately 1 day.  the effect is strain-dependent and dose-dependent.

TI  == microchip electrophoresis of bacteria using lipid-based liquid crystalline nanoparticles.
AB  == the aggregation and adhesion of bacterial cells is a serious disadvantage for electrophoretic separations of bacteria. in this study, lipid-based liquid crystalline nanoparticles were used as a pseudostationary phase to minimise the bacterial aggregation and adsorption to the inner walls of microchannels. lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus rhamnosus were selected as analytes and were separated by microchip electrophoresis (mce) with laser-induced fluorescence (lif) detection using 4.5 mm tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (tris)-4.5 mm boric acid-0.1 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetate (edta) (tbe) containing poly(ethylene oxide) (peo) and lipid-based nanoparticles as the running buffer. the mechanism of lipid-based nanoparticles affecting bacterial adhesion and aggregation was discussed and supported by zeta potential experiments. under the optimal conditions, the three  species of bacteria were identified with patterned peaks. this proposed mce method using lipid-based nanoparticles as running buffer additives was also used  to analyse a real yogurt sample, and valuable bacterial information was obtained  by the electropherograms.

TI  == lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and streptococcus thermophilus induce suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (socs3) gene expression directly and indirectly via interleukin-10 in human primary macrophages.
AB  == in the present study we have characterized t helper type 2 (th2) [interleukin (il)-10]/th1 (il-12) cytokine expression balance in human primary macrophages stimulated with multiple non-pathogenic gram-positive bacteria used in the food industry and as probiotic substances. bacteria representing lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, lactococcus, leuconostoc, propionibacterium and streptococcus species induced anti-inflammatory il-10 production, although quantitative differences between the bacteria were observed. s. thermophilus was able to induce il-12 production, while the production of il-12 induced by other bacteria  remained at a low level. the highest anti-inflammatory potential was seen with bifidobacteria, as evidenced by high il-10/il-12 induction ratios. all studied non-pathogenic bacteria were able to stimulate the expression of suppressor of cytokine signalling (socs) 3 that controls the expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes. lactobacillus and streptococcus species induced socs3 mrna expression directly in the absence of protein synthesis and indirectly via bacteria-induced il-10 production, as demonstrated by experiments with cycloheximide (chx) and anti-il-10 antibodies, respectively. the mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) p38 signalling pathway played a key role  in bacteria-induced socs3 gene expression. enhanced il-10 production and socs3 gene expression induced by live non-pathogenic lactobacillus and streptococcus is also likely to contribute to their immunoregulatory effects in vivo.

TI  == coexpression of the superoxide dismutase and the catalase provides remarkable oxidative stress resistance in lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are generally sensitive to oxidative stress caused by  reactive oxygen species (ros). antioxidant enzymes, especially superoxide dismutase (sod) and catalase (cat), can protect against ros by eliminating superoxide and h(2)o(2), respectively. lactobacillus rhamnosus is a valuable probiotic starter culture but is deficient in both sod and cat, and is thus likely to suffer from oxidative stress in industrial fermentation. to confer high level of oxidative resistance on l. rhamnosus , the sod gene soda from streptococcus thermophilus and cat gene kata from l. sakei were coexpressed in l. rhamnosus as 1.2466. the enzyme activities of sod and cat were 147.80 +/- 1.08 u/mg protein and 2.53 mumol of h(2)o(2) /min/10(8) cfu, respectively, in the recombinant l. rhamnosus cs. after incubation with 10 mm h(2)o(2), the survival ratio of l. rhamnosus cs was 400-fold higher than that of l. rhamnosus cat. in long-term aerated conditions, viable cells of l. rhamnosus cs remained approximately 10(6) cfu/ml after incubation for 7 days, while no living cells of  the control were detected. these results showed that the cooperation between sod  and cat could significantly enhance oxidative resistance in l. rhamnosus . to our best knowledge, this is the first report of two synergistic antioxidant genes being coexpressed in the same lactobacilli.

TI  == pecorino crotonese cheese: study of bacterial population and flavour compounds.
AB  == the diversity and dynamics of the dominant bacterial population during the manufacture and the ripening of two artisanal pecorino crotonese cheeses, provided by different farms, were investigated by the combination of culture-dependent and -independent approaches. three hundred and thirty-three strains were isolated from selective culture media, clustered using restriction fragment length polymorphism and were identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing. the results indicate a decrease in biodiversity during ripening, revealing the presence of lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus species in the curd and in aged cheese samples and the occurrence of several lactobacilli throughout  cheese ripening, with the dominance of lactobacillus rhamnosus species. bacterial dynamics determined by denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis provided a more precise description of the distribution of bacteria, highlighting differences in  the bacterial community among cheese samples, and allowed to detect lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus buchneri and leuconostoc mesenteroides species, which were not isolated. moreover, the concentration of flavour compounds produced throughout cheese ripening was investigated and related to lactic acid bacteria presence. fifty-seven compounds were identified in the volatile fraction of pecorino crotonese cheeses by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. esters, alcohols and free fatty acids were the most abundant compounds, while aldehydes and hydrocarbons were present at low levels.

TI  == production of exopolysaccharides by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains of  human origin, and metabolic activity of the producing bacteria in milk.
AB  == this work reports on the physicochemical characterization of 21 exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, as well as the growth and metabolic activity of the eps-producing strains in milk. the strains belong to the species  lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus vaginalis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. the molar mass distribution of eps fractions showed 2 peaks of different sizes, which is a feature shared with some eps from bacteria of food origin. in general, we detected an association between the eps size distribution and the eps-producing species, although because of the low numbers of human bacterial eps tested, we could not conclusively establish a correlation. the main monosaccharide components of the eps under study were glucose, galactose, and rhamnose, which are the same as those found in food polymers; however, the rhamnose and glucose ratios was generally higher than the  galactose ratio in our human bacterial eps. all eps-producing strains were able to grow and acidify milk; most lactobacilli produced lactic acid as the main metabolite. the lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio in bifidobacteria was 0.7, close to the theoretical ratio, indicating that the eps-producing strains did not produce an excessive amount of acetic acid, which could adversely affect the sensory properties of fermented milks. with respect to their viscosity-intensifying ability, l. plantarum h2 and l. rhamnosus e41 and e43r were able to increase the viscosity of stirred, fermented milks to a similar extent as the eps-producing streptococcus thermophilus strain used as a positive  control. therefore, these human eps-producing bacteria could be used as adjuncts  in mixed cultures for the formulation of functional foods if probiotic characteristics could be demonstrated. this is the first article reporting the physicochemical characteristics of eps isolated from human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == enhancement of survival of probiotic and non-probiotic lactic acid bacteria by yeasts in fermented milk under non-refrigerated conditions.
AB  == the effects of yeasts on the survival of probiotic and non-probiotic lactic acid  bacteria (lab) were studied in fermented milk under non-refrigerated conditions (30 degrees c) with a view to develop ambient-stable fermented milk with live lab. five yeasts tested (saccharomyces bayanus, williopsis saturnus var. saturnus, yarrowia lipolytica, candida kefyr and kluyveromyces marxianus) enhanced the survival of lactobacillus bulgaricus (but not streptococcus thermophilus) in a mixed yoghurt culture in yoghurt by approximately 10(2) to 10(5)-fold. seven yeasts examined (candida krusei, geotrichum candidum, pichia subpelliculosa, kloeckera apiculata, pichia membranifaciens, schizosaccharomyces  pombe and y. lipolytica) improved the survival of lactobacillus rhamnosus in fermented milk by approximately10(3) to 10(6)-fold. w. saturnus var. saturnus enhanced the survival of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. rhamnosus (probiotic) and  lactobacillus reuteri by up to 10(6)-fold, but the same yeast failed to improve the survival of lactobacillus johnsonii (probiotic), s. thermophilus and l. bulgaricus in fermented milk. these results provide definitive evidence that yeasts possess stability-enhancing effects on lab and that the specific effects of yeasts on lab stability vary with yeasts as well as with lab. however, the molecular mechanism of such interaction of yeasts with lab remains to be found.

AB  == the simultaneous effects of different binary co-cultures of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus rhamnosus and bifidobacterium lactis with streptococcus thermophilus and of different prebiotics on the production of fermented milk were investigated in this paper. in particular, we determined and compared the kinetics of acidification of milk either as such or supplemented with 4% (w/w) maltodextrin, oligofructose and polydextrose, as well as the probiotic survival, chemical composition (ph, lactose, lactic acid and protein contents), fatty acids profile and conjugate linoleic acid (cla) content of fermented milk after storage at 4 degrees c for 24 h. fermented milk quality was strongly influenced both by the co-culture composition and the selected prebiotic. depending on the co-culture, prebiotic addition to milk influenced to different extent kinetic acidification parameters. all probiotic counts were stimulated by oligofructose and polydextrose, and among these b. lactis always exhibited the highest counts in all supplemented milk samples. polydextrose addition led to the highest post-acidification. although the contents of the main fatty acids were only barely influenced, the highest amounts of conjugated linoleic acid (38% higher than in the control) were found in milk fermented by s. thermophilus-l. acidophilus co-culture and supplemented with maltodextrin.

TI  == effects of copper supplement on growth and viability of strains used as starters  and adjunct cultures for emmental cheese manufacture.
AB  == aims: to determine the effects of supplemented copper (cu2+) on growth and viability of strains used as starters and adjunct cultures for emmental cheese manufacture. methods and results: thirteen strains belonging to lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, streptococcus thermophilus or propionibacterium freudenreichii species were exposed to various  copper concentrations in the proper growth medium at relevant growth temperatures, and the effects of supplemented copper on bacterial growth and cell viability were determined by optical density and ph measurements, also by platings. among the species considered, l. delbrueckii was the most copper resistant and s. thermophilus the most sensitive to copper. anaerobic conditions  increased this sensitivity significantly. there was also a considerable amount of variation in copper resistance at strain level. conclusions: copper resistance is both a species- and strain-dependent property and may reflect variability in copper-binding capacities by cell wall components among species and strains. in addition, the chemical state of copper may be involved. significance and impact of the study: this study revealed that copper resistance is a highly variable property among starter and adjunct strains, and this variability should be considered when strains are selected for emmental cheese manufacture.

TI  == microbiological, chemical, and sensory characteristics of swiss cheese manufactured with adjunct lactobacillus strains using a low cooking temperature.
AB  == the effect of nonstarter lactobacillus adjunct cultures on the microbial, chemical, and sensory characteristics of swiss cheese manufactured using the "kosher make procedure" was investigated. the kosher make procedure, which uses a lower cooking temperature than traditional swiss cheese making, is used by many american cheese manufacturers to allow for kosher-certified whey. cheeses were manufactured using a commercial starter culture combination and 1 of 3 non-starter lactobacillus strains previously isolated from swiss cheeses, lactobacillus casei a26, l. casei b21, and lactobacillus rhamnosus h2, as an adjunct. control cheeses lacked the adjunct culture. cheeses were analyzed during ripening for microbial and chemical composition. adjunct strain l. casei a26, which utilized citrate most readily in laboratory medium, dominated the lactobacillus population within 30 d, faster than the other adjunct cultures. there were no significant differences in propionibacterium counts, streptococcus  thermophilus counts, protein, fat, moisture, salt, and ph among the cheeses. free amino acid concentration ranged from 5 to 7 mmol/100 g of cheese at 90 d of ripening and was adjunct strain dependent. lactic, acetic, and propionic acid concentrations were not significantly different among the cheeses after a 90-d ripening period; however differences in propionic acid concentrations were apparent at 60 d, with the cheeses made with l. casei adjuncts containing less propionic acid. citric acid was depleted by the end of warm room ripening in cheeses manufactured with adjunct l. casei strains, but not with adjunct l. rhamnosus. cheeses made with l. casei a26 were most similar to the control cheeses in diacetyl and butyric/isobutyric acid abundance as evaluated by electronic nose during the first 3 mo of ripening. the 4 cheese types differed in their descriptive sensory profiles at 8 mo of age, indicating an adjunct strain-dependent effect on particular flavor attributes. adjunct lactobacillus spp. affected the flavor profile and concentration of some flavor compounds in swiss cheeses produced with the kosher make procedure. use of adjunct lactobacillus cultures provides swiss cheese makers using a low cooking temperature with a means to control the dominant lactobacillus strain during ripening, reduce citrate concentration, and modify cheese flavor.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory activity of selenium-enriched probiotics against pathogenic escherichia coli (e. coli) in vitro and in vivo. escherichia coli was co-cultured in vitro with each probiotic  strain individually, and a mixture of the four strains and its population was counted at various time points. we also collected a cell-free culture supernatant (cfcs) of each probiotic strain and the four-strain mix to examine their antibacterial activity, using the cylinder plate method. results demonstrated that co-culture with probiotics significantly reduced the number of e. coli. the  different sizes of the inhibition zones made by each cfcs proved that e. coli was inhibited by the metabolites of the probiotics. in vivo, kunming mice were allocated to different groups supplemented with selenium-enriched and other probiotics. after 28 days, the mice were inoculated with pathogenic e. coli so that we could compare mortality rates and inspect other indexes of each treatment. the mortality of the group with selenium-enriched probiotics was the lowest. in addition, the organic antioxidant status improved, immunity was fortified, and the internal environment of the intestinal tract was enhanced with selenium-enriched probiotic supplementation. in conclusion, selenium-enriched probiotics can strongly antagonize pathogenic e. coli in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == effect of wild strains used as starter cultures and adjunct cultures on the volatile compounds of the pecorino siciliano cheese.
AB  == the effect of six wild strains on the volatile profile of the ps cheese was investigated and compared to that generated from industrial starters generally used to produce ps cheese. all cheeses were subjected to microbiological, physicochemical, and volatile compounds analyses. the dgge of the 16s rdna analysis was also applied. the volatile compounds generated during ripening were  studied through the spme and the gc-ms methods. no difference was detected between the experimental and control cheeses throughout chemical and microbiological analyses, while the dgge results showed the presence of streptococcus thermophilus in all cheeses, and the dominance of enterococcus durans, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus casei in most of the experimental cheeses. moreover, the presence of lactococcus lactis species as in  the control and in the experimental p2 and p4 cheeses was also revealed. the spme results showed more pronounced volatile compounds in the experimental cheese samples than in the control ones.

TI  == yogurt containing probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. reuteri rc-14 helps resolve moderate diarrhea and increases cd4 count in hiv/aids patients.
AB  == hiv/aids is changing the human landscape in sub-saharan africa. relatively few patients receive antiretroviral therapy, and many suffer from debilitating diarrhea that affects their quality of life. given the track record of probiotics to alleviate diarrhea, conventional yogurt fermented with lactobacillus delbruekii var bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus was supplemented with probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. reuteri rc-14. twenty-four hiv/aids adult female patients (18 to 44 y) with clinical signs of moderate diarrhea, cd4  counts over 200, and not receiving antiretrovirals or dietary supplements, consumed either 100 ml supplemented or unsupplemented yogurt per day for 15 days. hematologic profiles, cd4 cell counts, and quality of life was evaluated at baseline, 15 and 30 days postprobiotic-yogurt feeding. there was no significant alteration in the hematologic parameters of both groups before and after the probiotic-yogurt feeding. the probiotic yogurt group at baseline, 15 and 30 days  had a mean wbc count of 5.8+/-0.76 x 10(9)/l, 6.0+/-1.02 x 10(9)/l, and 5.4+/-0.14 x 10(9)/l, respectively. however, the mean cd4 cell count remained the same or increased at 15 and 30 days in 11/12 probiotic-treated subjects compared  to 3/12 in the control. diarrhea, flatulence, and nausea resolved in 12/12 probiotic-treated subjects within 2 days, compared to 2/12 receiving yogurt for 15 days. this is the first study to show the benefits of probiotic yogurt on quality of life of women in nigeria with hiv/aids, and suggests that perhaps a simple fermented food can provide some relief in the management of the aids epidemic in africa.

TI  == heat- and formalin-inactivated probiotic bacteria induce comparable cytokine patterns in intestinal epithelial cell-leucocyte cocultures.
AB  == the mode of inactivation of probiotic bacteria may profoundly affect their immune-modulatory properties to the point of reversal of effects in in vitro human intestinal epithelial-like cell cultures (caco-2). to further investigate the influence of inactivation treatment on cytokine production, three probiotic strains were evaluated-live, heat-inactivated, and formalin-inactivated strains-for their impact on interleukin (il) 6, il-8, and il-10 production in caco-2-leucocyte cocultures. the tested bacteria induced strain-specific production of il-6, il-8, and il-10. no suppressive effects on cytokine synthesis were observed. live microorganisms seemed to be slightly more potent inducers of  cytokine production than nonviable strains, but differences to inactivated bacteria were not statistically significant. our results indicate that heat and formalin treatments of probiotic microorganisms are equivalent inactivation methods in terms of induction of il-6, il-8, and il-10 production in caco-2-peripheral blood mononuclear cell cocultures and do not invert immune-modulatory effects.

TI  == probiotics for treatment of acute diarrhoea in children: randomised clinical trial of five different preparations.
AB  == objective: to compare the efficacy of five probiotic preparations recommended to  parents in the treatment of acute diarrhoea in children. design randomised controlled clinical trial in collaboration with family paediatricians over 12 months. setting: primary care. participants: children aged 3-36 months visiting a family paediatrician for acute diarrhoea. intervention: children's parents were randomly assigned to receive written instructions to purchase a specific probiotic product: oral rehydration solution (control group); lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg; saccharomyces boulardii; bacillus clausii; mix of l delbrueckii var bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, l acidophilus, and bifidobacterium bifidum; or enterococcus faecium sf68. main outcome measures: primary outcomes were duration of diarrhoea and daily number and consistency of stools. secondary outcomes were duration of vomiting and fever and rate of admission to hospital. safety and tolerance were also recorded. results: 571 children were allocated to intervention. median duration of diarrhoea was significantly shorter (p<0.001) in children who received l rhamnosus strain gg (78.5 hours) and the mix of four bacterial strains (70.0 hours) than in children  who received oral rehydration solution alone (115.0 hours). one day after the first probiotic administration, the daily number of stools was significantly lower (p<0.001) in children who received l rhamnosus strain gg and in those who received the probiotic mix than in the other groups. the remaining preparations did not affect primary outcomes. secondary outcomes were similar in all groups. conclusions: not all commercially available probiotic preparations are effective  in children with acute diarrhoea. paediatricians should choose bacterial preparations based on effectiveness data. trial registration number: current controlled trials isrctn56067537 [controlled-trials.com].

TI  == conjugated linoleic acid conversion by dairy bacteria cultured in mrs broth and buffalo milk.
AB  == aims: to evaluate strains of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and streptococci for their ability to produce conjugated linoleic acid (cla) from free linoleic acid (la). methods and results: eight dairy bacteria tolerant to la were grown in mrs  broth containing la (200 microg ml(-1)) and cla was assessed. seven bacteria were able to form cla after 24 h of incubation, varying percentage conversion between  17% and 36%. lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium bifidum and streptococcus thermophilus showed the highest la conversion and were  inoculated into buffalo milk supplemented with different concentration of la. the production of cla at 200 microg ml(-1) of la was two- or threefold in milk than mrs broth. all evaluated strains were able to produce cla from high la levels (1000 microg ml(-1)). conclusions: the most tolerant strain to la was lact. casei. lacttobacillus rhamnosus produced the maximum level of cla at high la concentrations (800 microg ml(-1)). the selected bacteria may be considered as adjunct cultures to be included on dairy fermented products manufacture. low concentration of la must be added to the medium to enhance cla formation. significance and impact of the study: the production of cla by strains using milks from regional farms as medium offer a possible mechanism to enhance this beneficial compound in dairy products and those the possibility to develop functional foods.

TI  == nonstarter lactobacilli isolated from soft and semihard argentinean cheeses: genetic characterization and resistance to biological barriers.
AB  == nonstarter lactic acid bacteria isolated from argentinean cheeses were identified and characterized by focusing on their resistance to biological barriers, along with other physiological features of potential interest, in the search for future probiotic organisms. lactobacilli were enumerated and isolated from semihard and  soft cheeses made with multistrain streptococcus thermophilus starters. lactobacilli counts in 1-week-old cheeses were between 10(5) and 10(7) cfu/g and  then reached 10(7) cfu/ g in all 1-month samples, while streptococci were always  above 10(9) cfu/g. a total number of 22 lactobacilli isolates were retained, identified, and characterized by in vitro tests. species identity was determined  by carbohydrate metabolism and species-specific pcr assays. genetic diversity was explored by random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) pcr analysis. the lactobacillus strains were assigned to the species l. casei, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, and l. perolens. all the strains studied tolerated 25 ppm of lysozyme, and most of them showed resistance to 0.3% bile. after incubation in gastric solution (ph 2.0), counts decreased by several log units, ranging from 3.2 to 7.0. the strains were able to grow in the presence of  bile salts, but only three isolates were capable of deconjugation. the nonstarter lactobacilli that were assayed fermented the prebiotic substrates (especially lactulose and inulin). some strains showed high cell hydrophobicity and beta-galactosidase activity, as well as inhibitory activity against pathogenic bacteria. it was concluded that most of the lactobacilli isolated in this study demonstrated resistance to biological barriers and physiological characteristics  compatible with probiotic properties, which make them suitable for further research in in vivo studies aimed at identifying new probiotic organisms.

TI  == lactobacillus fermentum br11, a potential new probiotic, alleviates symptoms of colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium (dss) in rats.
AB  == current treatments for inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) are relatively ineffective. recently, probiotics have emerged as a potential treatment modality  for numerous gastrointestinal disorders, including ibd. few probiotics, however,  have undergone appropriate preclinical screening in vivo. the current study compared the effects of four candidate probiotics on development of dextran sulfate sodium (dss)-induced colitis in rats. sprague dawley rats were gavaged 1  ml of the potential probiotic (1 x 10(10) cfu/ml), or vehicle, twice daily for 14 days. strains tested were lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg), streptococcus thermophilus th-4 (th-4), bifidobacterium lactis bb12 (bb12) and lactobacillus fermentum br11 (br11). colitis was induced from day 7 to 14 via administration of 2% dss in drinking water. disease activity index (dai) was monitored daily until  rats were killed at day 14. dai decreased in dss+bb12 and dss+br11 compared to dss+vehicle. colon length increased in dss+br11 (10%) and dss+lgg (10%) compared  to dss+vehicle. dss+bb12 and dss+br11 prevented the distal colon crypt hyperplasia evident in dss+vehicle, dss+lgg and dss+th-4. br11 was most effective at reducing colitic symptoms. bb12 had minimal effects, whilst th-4 did not prevent dss-colitis and lgg actually exacerbated some indicators of colitis. further studies into the potential benefits of l. fermentum br11 are indicated.

TI  == bioproduction of conjugated linoleic acid by probiotic bacteria occurs in vitro and in vivo in mice.
AB  == probiotics have been shown to reduce the incidence of colon cancer in animal models. the mechanisms responsible for this activity are poorly defined. conjugated linoleic acids (cla) are a group of isomers of linoleic acid (la) possessing anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties, which can be produced from la by certain bacterial strains. in this study, the ability of probiotic bacteria to exert anticarcinogenic effects through the production of cla was assessed. incubation of probiotic bacteria (vsl3, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium breve, b. infantis, b. longum, and streptococcus thermophilus) in the presence of la yielded cla production as measured by gas chromatography. conditioned medium, containing probiotic-produced cla, reduced viability and induced apoptosis of ht-29 and caco-2 cells, as assessed by mtt assay and dna laddering, respectively. western blotting demonstrated an increased expression of ppargamma in cells treated with conditioned medium compared with la alone. incubation of murine feces with la after administering vsl3 yielded 100-fold more cla than feces collected prior to vsl3 feeding. this study supports a role for supplemental probiotics as a strategy both for attenuating inflammation and for preventing colon cancer.

AB  == the effect of probiotic bacteria on the formation of conjugated linoleic acid (cla), microbial growth, and organoleptic attributes (acidity, texture, and flavor) of fermented milk products was determined. four probiotic bacteria, lactobacillus rhamnosus, propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii 56, p. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii 51, and p. freudenreichii subsp. freudenreichii 23, were evaluated individually or in coculture with traditional yogurt cultures  (lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius subsp.  thermophilus). the lipid source was hydrolyzed soy oil. l. rhamnosus, in coculture with yogurt culture, resulted in the highest content of cla. growth and cla formation of propionibacteria were enhanced in the presence of yogurt cultures. texture and flavor attributes of fermented milks produced with propionibacteria were significantly different than the fermented milks processed  with yogurt cultures. the fermented milks processed with probiotic bacteria in coculture with yogurt cultures demonstrated similar acidity, texture, and flavor  as the fermented milk produced with yogurt cultures.

TI  == effects of specific lactic acid bacteria on the intestinal permeability to macromolecules and the inflammatory condition.
AB  == non-live probiotic bacteria and their fermentation products can be used in milk-based formula intended for healthy infants. the effects of a milk formula fermented with bifidobacterium breve and streptococcus thermophilus and heated/dehydrated to inactivate the micro-organisms have been reported over the last few years to decrease the intestinal permeability to macromolecules in experimental animals in vivo and more recently to down-regulate inflammatory condition in vitro. feeding guinea-pigs with such dehydrated fermented milk reinforced the intestinal barrier resistance to food proteins (hrp, beta-lactoglobulin). in addition, the products secreted by bacteria were capable  of inhibiting the lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced tnf-alpha secretion by human peripheral mononuclear blood cells. the active secretion products were resistant  to digestive enzymes and their anti-inflammatory properties were preserved after  transepithelial transport across the filter-grown intestinal epithelial cell line, especially in inflammatory conditions. the binding of lps to monocytes as well as nfkappab nuclear translocation leading to pro-inflammatory cytokine transcription were inhibited by bacteria-culture supernatants. conclusion: b. breve and s. thermophilus used as non-live micro-organisms in fermented infant formula seem to induce a reduction in macromolecular absorption and release metabolites exerting an anti-tnf-alpha effect, which persists after intestinal transport. thus, specific lactic acid bacteria and their metabolites seem to affect positively the intestinal function.

TI  == effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  == fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. in this study, three sourdough yeasts, candida milleri cbs 8195, saccharomyces cerevisiae ts 146, and torulaspora delbrueckii ts 207; a control, baker's yeast s. cerevisiae alko 743; and four lactobacillus spp., l. acidophilus tsb 262, l. brevis tsb 307, l. plantarum tsb 304, and l. sanfranciscensis tsb 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. the microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. total folate contents were determined using lactobacillus rhamnosus (atcc 7469) as the growth  indicator organism. the microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised  rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g  after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. strains of lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, l. helveticus, pediococcus spp., and streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. although the four lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal.  it was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as enterobacter cowanii and pantoea agglomerans.

TI  == rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by m13-generated, rapd-pcr fingerprint databases.
AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

TI  == two distinct pathways for the formation of hydroxy fa from linoleic acid by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == twenty-three of 86 strains of lactic acid bacteria transformed linoleic acid into hydroxy fa. two distinct conversion pathways were in operation. two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus and a strain of pediococcus pentosaceus produced 13(s)-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid 113(s)-oh 18:11 and 10,13dihydroxyoctadecanoic  acid (10,13-oh 18:0) as main and minor products, respectively, whereas 13 strains, including l. casei subsp. casei, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, l. lactis subsp. cremoris, and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus produced 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid (10-oh 18:1). seven strains of l. plantarum converted linoleic acid to 10-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10-oh 18:0) through 10-oh 18:1. linoleic acid at 2 g/l was converted by l. acidophilus  ifo13951t to 1.3 g of 13(s)-oh 18:1 and 0.09 g of 10,13-oh 18:0 in 7 d. lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei jcm 1111 produced 10-oh 18:1 in 91% yield, and l. plantarum jcm 8341, 10-oh 18:0 in 59% yield from linoleic acid (2 g/l) under optimal conditions. to our knowledge, this is the first report on the  production of 13(s)-oh 18:1 by lactic acid bacteria other than ruminal bacteria,  and of 10,13-oh 18:0 by any bacteria.

AB  == nineteen bacteriological media were evaluated to assess their suitability to selectively enumerate lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacteria, and propionibacteria. bacteriological media evaluated included streptococcus thermophilus agar, ph modified mrs agar, mrs-vancomycine agar, mrs-bile agar, mrs-nacl agar, mrs-lithium chloride agar, mrs-nnlp (nalidixic acid, neomycin sulfate, lithium chloride and paramomycine sulfate) agar, reinforced clostridial agar, sugar-based (such as maltose, galactose, sorbitol, manitol, esculin) media, sodium lactate agar, arabinose agar, raffinose agar, xylose agar, and l. casei agar. incubations were carried out under aerobic and anaerobic conditions at 27, 30, 37, 43, and 45 degrees c for 24, 72 h, and 7 to 9 d. s. thermophilus agar and aerobic incubation at 37 degrees c for 24 h were suitable for s. thermophilus. l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus could be enumerated using mrs agar (ph 4.58 or ph 5.20) and under anaerobic incubation at 45 degrees c for 72 h. mrs-vancomycine agar and anaerobic incubation at 43 degrees c for 72 h were suitable to enumerate l. rhamnosus. mrs-vancomycine agar and anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees c for 72 h were selective for l. casei. to estimate the counts of l. casei by subtraction method, counts of l. rhamnosus on mrs-vancomycine agar at 43 degrees c for 72 h under anaerobic incubation could be subtracted from total counts of l. casei and l. rhamnosus enumerated on mrs-vancomycine agar at 37 degrees c for 72 h under anaerobic incubation. l. acidophilus could be enumerated using mrs-agar at 43 degrees c for 72 h or basal agar-maltose agar at 43 degrees c for 72 h or ba-sorbitol agar at 37 degrees c for 72 h, under anaerobic incubation. bifidobacteria could be enumerated on mrs-nnlp agar under anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees c for 72 h. propionibacteria could be enumerated on sodium lactate agar under anaerobic incubation at 30 degrees c for 7 to 9 d. a subtraction method was most suitable for counting propionibacteria in the presence of other lactic acid bacteria from a product. for this method, counts of lactic bacteria at d 3 on sodium lactate agar under anaerobic incubation at 30 degrees c were subtracted from counts at d 7 of lactic bacteria and propionibacteria.

TI  == consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primers for amplification of priming  glycosyltransferase genes of the exopolysaccharide locus in strains of the lactobacillus casei group.
AB  == a primer design strategy named codehop (consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primer) for amplification of distantly related sequences was used to detect the priming glycosyltransferase (gt) gene in strains of the lactobacillus casei group. each hybrid primer consisted of a short 3' degenerate  core based on four highly conserved amino acids and a longer 5' consensus clamp region based on six sequences of the priming gt gene products from exopolysaccharide (eps)-producing bacteria. the hybrid primers were used to detect the priming gt gene of 44 commercial isolates and reference strains of lactobacillus rhamnosus, l. casei, lactobacillus zeae, and streptococcus thermophilus. the priming gt gene was detected in the genome of both non-eps-producing (eps(-)) and eps-producing (eps(+)) strains of l. rhamnosus. the sequences of the cloned pcr products were similar to those of the priming gt  gene of various gram-negative and gram-positive eps(+) bacteria. specific primers designed from the l. rhamnosus rw-9595m gt gene were used to sequence the end of  the priming gt gene in selected eps(+) strains of l. rhamnosus. phylogenetic analysis revealed that lactobacillus spp. form a distinctive group apart from other lactic acid bacteria for which gt genes have been characterized to date. moreover, the sequences show a divergence existing among strains of l. rhamnosus  with respect to the terminal region of the priming gt gene. thus, the pcr approach with consensus-degenerate hybrid primers designed with codehop is a practical approach for the detection of similar genes containing conserved motifs in different bacterial genomes.

TI  == influence of the oral administration of lactic acid bacteria on iga producing cells associated to bronchus.
AB  == intestinal, respiratory and genitourinary mucosal surfaces are the most important routes of entry for microbial pathogens. the stimulus of the mucosal immunity is  not easy because the trigger keys for the activation do not follow the ones of the systemic immune response. in previous works we have demonstrated that some lactic acid bacteria (lab), when orally administered, can induce an enhance of the gut immune response. taking into account the concept of a common mucosal response, we studied the effect of orally administered mice with lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactococcus lactis on the iga secreting cells associated to bronchus. as shown before, oral immunostimulation with lab induced an increase of the iga* cells at intestinal level by a dose depending effect. in this study it is also showed that the lab assayed, with exception of l. acidophilus, were able to enhance iga+ cells at bronchial level,  being also this effect dose dependent. the increment induced by some lab in the number of iga+ cells on the mucosa surface of the lower respiratory tract may be  very important to prevent bronchus diseases.

AB  == in the present work, the compared effect of milk base and starter culture on acidification, texture, growth, and stability of probiotic bacteria in fermented  milk processing, was studied. two strains of probiotic bacteria were used, lactobacillus acidophilus la5 and l. rhamnosus lr35, with two starter cultures. one starter culture consisted only of streptococcus thermophilus st7 (single starter culture); the other was a yogurt mixed culture with s. thermophilus st7 and l. bulgaricus lb12 (mixed starter culture). for the milk base preparation, four commercial dairy ingredients were tested (two milk protein concentrates and  two casein hydrolysates). the resulting fermented milks were compared to those obtained with control milk (without enrichment) and milk added with skim milk powder. the performance of the two probiotic strains were opposite. l. acidophilus la5 grew well on milk but showed a poor stability during storage. l.  rhamnosus lr35 grew weakly on milk but was remarkably stable during storage. with the strains tested in this study, the use of the single starter culture and the addition of casein hydrolysate gave the best probiotic cell counts. the fermentation time was of about 11 h, and the probiotic level after five weeks of  storage was greater than 106 cfu/ml for l. acidophilus la5 and 10(7) cfu/ml for l. rhamnosus lr35. however, an optimization of the level of casein hydrolysate added to milk base has to be done, in order to improve texture and flavor when using this dairy ingredient.

AB  == the effectiveness of yeast extracts (ye) and potato extracts (pe) to promote growth of seven lactic cultures was evaluated by automated spectrophotometry (as). two aspects of the growth curve were analysed: (1) maximum biomass obtained (using odmax) and (2) highest specific growth rate mu(max)) eleven lots from the  same pe-manufacturing process were examined for lot-to-lot variability. the odmax values of three of the seven strains were significantly affected by lot source, but mu(max) was not significantly affected. the growth of bacteria was systematically lower in base medium containing 100% pe than in base medium containing 100% ye for both odmax or mu(max) data, which could be related to the  lower content in nitrogen-based compounds in pe. in as assays, highest od values  for lactobacillus casei eq28, lactobacillus rhamnosus r-011, lactobacillus plantarum eq12, and streptococcus thermophilus r-083 were obtained with a mixture of pe and ye. fermentations (2 l) were also carried out to determine the accuracy of as to predict biomass levels obtained under fermentation trials. in these fermentations, replacement of 50% ye with pe was shown to enable good growth of s. thermophilus. with l. rhamnosus r-011, a high correlation (r2 = 0.95) was found between odmax data obtained in the as assays and that of the 2-l bioreactor when the same growth medium was used for both series of fermentations. however, as was not as efficient when industrial media were used for the bioreactor assays. the relationship was still good for odmax between as data and that of the bioreactor data with l. rhamnosus r-011 in industrial lbs medium (r2 = 0.87), but was very poor with the s. thermophilus r-083 on rosell #43 industrial medium (r2  = 0.33). since pe cost 40% less than ye, there are strong economic advantages in  considering such a partial replacement of ye by pe.

TI  == streptococcus thermophilus in cheddar cheese--production and fate of galactose.
AB  == the behaviour of streptococcus thermophilus in combination with lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris or subsp. lactis mesophilic starters in experimental cheddar cheese is reported. in a standard manufacturing procedure employing a 38  degrees c cook temperature, even very low levels (0.007%) of str. thermophilus combined with normal levels of the mesophilic starter (1.7%) resulted in increased rates of acid production, the formation of significant amounts of galactose (approximately 13 mmol/kg cheese), and populations nearly equivalent to those of the mesophilic lactic starter in the curd before salting. at a 41 degrees c cook temperature, the str. thermophilus attained a higher maximum population (approximately log 8.2 colony forming units (cfu)/g) than the lc. lactis subsp. cremoris (approximately log 6.8 cfu/g) and formed more galactose (approximately 28 mmol/kg). lactobacillus rhamnosus, deliberately added to a cheese made using str. thermophilus starter and which contained 24 mmol galactose/kg at day one, utilized all the galactose during the first 3 months of  cheese ripening. adventitious non-starter lactic acid bacteria had the potential  to utilize this substrate too, and a close relationship was demonstrated between  the increase in this flora and the disapearance of the galactose. some possible consequences for cheese quality of using str. thermophilus as a starter component are discussed.

TI  == gut mucosal immunostimulation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the beneficial properties of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on human health have been frequently demonstrated. the interaction of lab with the lymphoid cells associated to the gut to activate the mucosal immune system and the mechanisms by which they can exert an adjuvant effect is still unclear, as well as if this property is common for all the lab. we studied the influence of the oral administration of different geneous of lab such as lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. plantarum, lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus. we determined if the lab assayed were able to stimulate the specific, the non-specific immune response (inflammatory response), or both. we demonstrated that all the bacteria assayed were able to increase the number of iga producing cells associated to the lamina  propria of small intestine. this effect was dose dependent. the increase in iga+  producing cells was not always correlated with an increase in the cd4+ t cell number, indicating that some lab assayed only induced clonal expansion of b cells triggered to produce iga. most of them, induced an increase in the number of cells involved in the inflammatory immune response. cd8+ t cell were diminished or not affected, with exception of l. plantarum that induced an increase at low dose. this fact would mean that lab are unable to induce cytotoxicity mechanisms. we demonstrated the importance in the selection of lab to be used as gut mucosal  adjuvant. the different behaviours observed among them on the gut mucosal immune  response, specially those that induce inflammatory immune response, show that not all the lab can be used as oral adjuvant and that the beneficial effect of them can not generalized to genous or specie. the immunoadjuvant capacity would be a property of the strain assayed.

TI  == effect of probiotic bacteria on prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses in vitro.
AB  == the proliferation of yeasts in the mixed bacterial and fungal biofilms colonising silicone rubber voice prostheses in laryngectomised patients is the main cause of malfunctioning of the valve mechanism on the oesophageal side of the prostheses.  indwelling voice prostheses usually have to be replaced every 3-4 months. the consumption of probiotic bacteria is largely motivated by health claims related to the urogenital and lower digestive tract, but not to the upper digestive tract. the present study examined the influence of probiotic bacteria on the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses, as formed in a modified robbins device. exposure of oropharyngeal biofilms on voice prostheses to suspensions of bifidobacterium infantis 420 or enterococcus faecium 603 did not significantly reduce the number of yeasts in the biofilm. however, suspensions of lactobacillus fermentum b54, l. rhamnosus 744 or l. lactis cremoris sk11 led to a reduction in the number of yeasts harvested from the voice prostheses. suspensions of l. casei shirota and streptococcus thermophilus b significantly reduced the number of yeasts in the biofilm to 39% and 33%, respectively. the reduction brought about in yeast prevalence in the mixed biofilm was greatest by exposure to a suspension of l. lactis 53, with yeast prevalence only 4% of the control. in conclusion, the study demonstrated that the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice  prostheses might be controlled by consumption of probiotic bacteria.

TI  == effect of 8 week intake of probiotic milk products on risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.
AB  == objective: to investigate the effect of a probiotic milk product containing the culture causido(r) and of two alternative products on risk factors for cardiovascular disease in overweight and obese subjects. design: an 8 week randomized, double-blind, placebo- and compliance-controlled, parallel study. subjects: seventy healthy, weight-stable, overweight and obese (25.0<bmi<37.5 kg/m2) males (n=20) and females (n=50), 18-55 y old, were randomly assigned into  five groups. intervention: four groups consumed 450 ml fermented milk products (yoghurt) daily. group 1: a yoghurt fermented with two strains of streptococcus thermophilus and two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus (stla). group 2: a placebo yoghurt fermented with delta-acid-lactone (py). group 3: a yoghurt fermented with two strains of streptococcus thermophilus and one strain of lactobacillus rhamnosus (stlr). group 4: a yoghurt fermented with one strain of enterococcus faecium and two strains of streptococcus thermophilus (causido(r) culture), gaio(r) (g). the dietary composition of the yoghurt was otherwise similar. the fifth group was given two placebo pills (pp) daily. results: when comparing all five treatment groups, unadjusted for changes in body weight, no statistical effects were observed in week 8 in the g-group on low density lipoproteins (ldl)-cholesterol (p=0.29). after adjustment for small changes in body weight, ldl-cholesterol decreased by 8.4% (0.26+/-0.10 mmol/l; p<0.05) and fibrinogen increased (0.74+/-0.32 mmol/l; p<0.05) after 8 weeks in the g-group. this was significantly different from the group consuming chemically fermented yoghurt and the group consuming placebo pills (p<0.05). after 8 weeks, systolic blood pressure was significantly more reduced in the stla and g-group compared to stlr. no other differences were found. conclusion: the causido(r) culture reduced ldl-cholesterol and increased fibrinogen in the overweight subjects at a 450 ml consumption daily for 8 weeks. the effect on ldl-cholesterol confirms previous studies. an immunostimulation by one of the strains in the product might explain  the effect on fibrinogen in the g-group. sponsorship: md foods a/s, denmark.

TI  == a probiotic strain of l. acidophilus reduces dmh-induced large intestinal tumors  in male sprague-dawley rats.
AB  == probiotic bacteria strains were examined for their influence on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh)-induced intestinal tumors in 100 male sprague-dawley  rats. lactobacillus acidophilus (delvo pro la-1), lactobacillus rhamnosus (gg), bifidobacterium animalis (cscc1941), and streptococcus thermophilus (dd145) strains were examined for their influence when added as freeze-dried bacteria to  an experimental diet based on a high-fat semipurified (ain-93) rodent diet. four  bacterial treatments were compared: l. acidophilus, l. acidophilus + b. animalis, l. rhamnosus, and s. thermophilus, the bacteria being added daily at 1% freeze-dried weight (10(10) colony-forming units/g) to the diet. trends were observed in the incidence of rats with large intestinal tumors for three treatments: 25% lower than control for l. acidophilus, 20% lower for l. acidophilus + b. animalis and l. rhamnosus treatments, and 10% lower for s. thermophilus. large intestinal tumor burden was significantly lower for treated rats with l. acidophilus than for the control group (10 and 3 tumors/treatment group, respectively, p = 0.05). large intestinal tumor mass index was also lower  for the l. acidophilus treatment than for control (1.70 and 0.10, respectively, p < 0.05). other treatments showed no statistically significant change from control for these indexes of tumorigenesis. for rats fed l. acidophilus, no adenocarcinomas were present in the colons. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of bacterial chromosomal dna fragments was used to differentiate introduced (exogenous) bacterial strains from indigenous bacteria of the same genera present in the feces. survival during gut passage and displacement of indigenous lactobacilli occurred with introduced l. acidophilus and l. rhamnosus gg during the probiotic treatment period. however, introduced strains of b. animalis and s. thermophilus were not able to be isolated from feces. it is concluded that this strain of l. acidophilus supplied as freeze-dried bacteria in the diet was protective, as seen by a small but significant inhibition of tumors within the rat colon.

TI  == antiproliferative effects of homogenates derived from five strains of candidate probiotic bacteria.
AB  == unheated and heat-treated homogenates were separately prepared from candidate probiotic bacteria, including lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus. we compared the phytohemagglutinin-induced proliferation of mononuclear cells in the presence of homogenates and in the presence of a control containing no homogenate by assessing thymidine incorporation in cell cultures. all homogenates suppressed proliferation, whether the enzymatic activity was inactivated or not inactivated by heating. when the proliferation assays were repeated with cytoplasmic and cell wall extracts derived from the homogenate of l. rhamnosus gg, the cytoplasmic extract but not the cell wall extract was suppressive. these findings indicate that candidate probiotic bacteria possess a heat-stable antiproliferative component(s). these bacteria may be used to generate microbiologically nonviable yet immunologically  active probiotic food products that are easier to store and have a longer shelf life.

TI  == study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. antigens administered orally can interact with m cells of peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. we have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance  the gut inflammatory immune response. the aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. we studied iga+ and igm+ b cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and cd4+ t cells and iga anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by  oral administration of lactobacillus casei, lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lb.  acidophilus, lb. plantarum, lb. rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, and streptococcus  salivarius ssp. thermophilus. the increase in the iga+ b cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the iga cycle by interaction with m cells from peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. the igm+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from igm+ to iga+. the increase in the cd4+ cells suggests interaction of peyer's patches and  enhancement of the b- and t-cell migration. the anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. we demonstrated that lb. casei and lb. plantarum were able to interact with peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in iga-, cd4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase  in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. although lb. rhamnosus and strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. lactococcus lactis and lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of iga+ cells entering the iga cycle but not cd4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated b lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. we did not determine specific antibodies against lc. lactis or lb. bulgaricus.

TI  == preliminary characterization of microflora of comte cheese.
AB  == the evolution of the microflora of three comte cheeses made in duplicate with raw milk from three different sources was followed during ripening. the same starter  was used with each type of milk. the comparison of the cheeses did not reveal any significant difference in the development of the microflora. starter lactic acid  bacteria (streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus helveticus), which are added at the beginning of manufacture, decreased quickly in the first stages of ripening supporting the hypothesis of cell autolysis. other microorganisms, i.e.  homofermentative and heterofermentative lactobacilli (lact. delbrueckii ssp. lactis, lact. paracasei ssp. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. fermentum), pediococci, enterococci and propionibacteria grew in cheese from small numbers in fresh curd. the characterization of strep. thermophilus by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that wild strains were also able to grow in the curd. the  values for the genome size of 11 strep. thermophilus strains determined in this investigation were in the range of 1.8-2.3 mbp. the potential role of starter and raw milk microflora in cheese flavour development was considered.

AB  == spacer regions between the 16s and 23s rrna genes of different dairy and probiotic lactic acid bacteria were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with conserved primers and the nucleotide sequences of these spacer regions were determined. amplification/oligonucleotide primer pairs were designed for lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus and streptococcus thermophilus based on the differences in the nucleotide sequences of the 16s-23s  rrna spacer regions. also a primer pair identifying both lb. paracasei and lb. rhamnosus was designed. in addition to conventional pcr in a heat block a rapid pcr method in an air thermocycler (atc) with glass capillaries was used.

TI  == anti-mutagenic and immuno-stimulatory properties of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == statistically significant antigenotoxic activity was exerted by six of nine strains of lactic acid bacteria tested (lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, staphylococcus carnosus, streptococcus thermophilus, l. rhamnosus, enterococcus faecium and en. faecalis) against nitrovin and 2-aminofluorene in salmonella typhimurium ta100 and ta97. the mutagenic activity of both mutagens was substantially decreased by viable bacteria; cells heated to 100 degrees c for 15 min were ineffective. in vitro, en. faecium stimulated the basic metabolic activities of human neutrophils which were essential for their antimicrobial and  cytotoxic activity, whereas stimulation of guinea-pig macrophages was not so effective. similar immuno-stimulatory effects were observed with both viable and  heat-inactivated bacteria.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria in the treatment of acute rotavirus gastroenteritis.
AB  == we compared different lactic acid bacteria for their effect on the immune response to rotavirus in children with acute rotavirus gastroenteritis. after initial oral rehydration, 49 children aged 6 to 35 months with rotavirus gastroenteritis randomly received either lactobacillus casei subsp. casei strain  gg (lgg), l. casei subsp. rhamnosus (lactophilus), or a combination of streptococcus thermophilus and l. delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus (yalacta) twice daily for 5 days. serum antibodies to rotavirus, total number of immunoglobulin-secreting cells (isc), and specific antibody-secreting cells (sasc) to rotavirus were measured at the acute stage and at convalescence. the mean (sd) duration of diarrhea was 1.8 (0.8) days in children who received lgg, 2.8 (1.2) days in those receiving lactophilus, and 2.6 (1.4) days in those receiving yalacta (f = 3.3, p = 0.04). the isc response was comparable in the three study groups, but the rotavirus-specific immune responses were different. lgg therapy was associated with an enhancement of iga sasc to rotavirus and serum iga antibody level at convalescent stage. we conclude that certain strains of lactic acid bacteria, particularly lgg, promote serum and intestinal immune responses to rotavirus, and thus may be important in establishing immunity against rotavirus reinfections.

TI  == absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.
AB  == to investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum, lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. the production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by hplc analysis in growing cultures. resting whole cells from a positive control strain, eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of  .2 mm cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at ph 7.3. however, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. in growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by e. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. none of the test strains showed production of either  deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.
