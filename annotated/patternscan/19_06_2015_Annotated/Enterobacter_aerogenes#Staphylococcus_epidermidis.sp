TI  == a sequential statistical approach towards an optimized production of a broad spectrum bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium bacillus sp. yas 1 strain.
AB  == bacteriocins, ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides, display potential applications in agriculture, medicine, and industry. the present study highlights integral statistical optimization and partial characterization of a bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium taxonomically affiliated as bacillus sp. yas 1 after biochemical and molecular identifications. a sequential statistical approach (plackett-burman and box-behnken) was employed to optimize bacteriocin (bac yas 1) production. using optimal levels of three key determinants (yeast extract (0.48% (w/v), incubation time (62 hrs), and agitation speed (207 rpm)) in peptone yeast beef based production medium resulted in 1.6-fold enhancement in bac yas 1 level (470 au/ml arbitrary units against erwinia amylovora). bac yas 1  showed activity over a wide range of ph (1-13) and temperature (45-80 degrees c). a wide spectrum antimicrobial activity of bac yas 1 against the human pathogens (clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus epidermidis, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus sp., proteus sp., klebsiella sp., and salmonella typhimurium), the plant pathogen (e. amylovora), and the food spoiler  (listeria innocua) was demonstrated. on top and above, bac yas 1 showed no antimicrobial activity towards lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. lactis, and l. reuteri). promising characteristics of bac yas 1 prompt  its commercialization for efficient utilization in several industries.

TI  == decoction, infusion and hydroalcoholic extract of cultivated thyme: antioxidant and antibacterial activities, and phenolic characterisation.
AB  == bioactivity of thyme has been described, but mostly related to its essential oils, while studies with aqueous extracts are scarce. herein, the antioxidant and antibacterial properties of decoction, infusion and hydroalcoholic extract, as also their phenolic compounds, were evaluated and compared. decoction showed the  highest concentration of phenolic compounds (either phenolic acids or flavonoids), followed by infusion and hydroalcoholic extract. in general, the samples were effective against gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis) and gram-negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus aerogenes, proteus vulgaris and enterobacter sakazakii) bacteria, with decoction presenting the most pronounced effect. this sample also displayed the highest radical scavenging activity and reducing power. data obtained support the idea that compounds with strong antioxidant and antibacterial activities are also water-soluble. furthermore, the use of thyme infusion and decoction, by both internal and external use, at recommended doses,  is safe and no adverse reactions have been described.

TI  == inactivation of bacteria and yeast using high-frequency ultrasound treatment.
AB  == high-frequency (850 khz) ultrasound was used to inactivate bacteria and yeast at  different growth phases under controlled temperature conditions. three species of bacteria, enterobacter aerogenes, bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus epidermidis as well as a yeast, aureobasidium pullulans were considered. the study shows that high-frequency ultrasound is highly efficient in inactivating the bacteria in both their exponential and stationary growth phases, and inactivation rates of more than 99% were achieved. tem observation suggests that  the mechanism of bacteria inactivation is mainly due to acoustic cavitation generated free radicals and h2o2. the rod-shaped bacterium b. subtilis was also found to be sensitive to the mechanical effects of acoustic cavitation. the study showed that the inactivation process continued even after ultrasonic processing cessed due to the presence of h2o2, generated during acoustic cavitation. compared to bacteria, the yeast a. pullulans was found to be more resistant to high-frequency ultrasound treatment.

TI  == the presence of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial pathogens in endotracheal tube biofilms and corresponding surveillance cultures.
AB  == mechanically ventilated patients often develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap). soon after intubation, a mixed biofilm harboring microbial pathogens is formed on the endotracheal tube (et). it is believed that this biofilm contributes to the development of vap. unfortunately, the causative agent is often not known at the time vap is suspected, and early therapy often relies on the identification of surveillance cultures (sc). it is thus important to know whether these sc can predict the microbial flora in et biofilms. in this study, we compare the presence of a number of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial bacteria (enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) and of candida albicans in cultures from et biofilms and sc (i.e. sputum samples, nose swabs, and throat swabs) of 20 mechanically ventilated patients. our data indicate that  there is a good correlation between the presence of (antibiotic-resistant) pathogens in et biofilms and sc.

TI  == inactivation of microorganisms by low-frequency high-power ultrasound: 1. effect  of growth phase and capsule properties of the bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the effects of high-intensity low-frequency (20 khz) ultrasound treatment on the viability of bacteria suspension. more specifically, we have investigated the relationship between the  deactivation efficiency and the physical (size, hydrophobicity) and biological (gram-status, growth phase) properties of the microbes. enterobacter aerogenes, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus epidermidis, s. epidermidis sk and staphylococcus pseudintermedius were chosen for this study owing to their varying physical and biological properties. the survival ratio of the bacteria suspension was measured as a function of the ultrasound power (up to 13 w) for a constant sonication time of 20 min. transmission electron microscopy was used to evaluate  the ultrasound-induced damages to the microbes. ultrasound treatment resulted in  lethal damage to e. aerogenes and b. subtilis (up to 4.5-log reduction), whereas  staphylococcus spp. were not affected noticeably. further, e. aerogenes suspensions were more sensitive to ultrasonication in exponential growth phase than when they were in stationary phase. the results of this study demonstrate that the main reason for bacterial resistance to ultrasonic deactivation is due to the properties of the bacterial capsule. microbes with a thicker and "soft" capsule are highly resistant to ultrasonic deactivation process.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of schinus lentiscifolius (anacardiaceae).
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: schinus lentiscifolius marchand (syn. schinus weinmannifolius engl) is a plant native to rio grande do sul (southern brazil) and has been used in brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. material and methods: the crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, three gram negative bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: candida albicans, candida tropicalis, cryptococcus neoformans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two gram positive bacteria, namely, bacillus cereus, enterococcus spp, and six gram negative bacteria, namely, burkholderia cepacia, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis. results: the leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of schinus lentiscifolius showed a  broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (mic) against the tested bacteria and fungi. the n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against candida albicans (mic=25 mug/ml), candida tropicalis (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and cryptococcus neoformans, (mic=15.5 mug/ml). from the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of schinus lentiscifolius. conclusion: the antimicrobial activity and some constituents of schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. the results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.

TI  == a possible role of partially pyrolysed essential oils in australian aboriginal traditional ceremonial and medicinal smoking applications of eremophila longifolia (r. br.) f. muell (scrophulariaceae).
AB  == ethnopharmacological significance: eremophila longifolia is one of the most respected of the traditional medicines used by australian aboriginal people. customary use involves smoldering the leaves over hot embers of a fire to produce an acrid smoke, believed to have therapeutic effects broadly consistent with antimicrobial, antifungal and anti-inflammatory capacity. aim of the study: the current study aims to examine the contribution of partially pyrolysed and non-pyrolysed essential oils in traditional usage of eremophila longifolia. materials and methods: non-pyrolysed and partially pyrolysed essential oils were  produced by hydrodistillation and part-wet/part-dry distillation, respectively. all samples were tested for antimicrobial activity by broth dilution. some of these samples were further treated to an incrementally stepped temperature profile in a novel procedure employing a commercial thermocycler in an attempt to mimic the effect of temperature gradients produced during smoking ceremonies. components from the pyrodistilled oils were compared with the non-pyrodistilled oils, using gc-ms, gc-fid and hplc-pad. the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl method, was used to compare free radical scavenging ability. results: partially pyrolysed oils had approximately three or more times greater antimicrobial activity, enhanced in cultures warmed incrementally to 60 degrees c and held for 30s and further enhanced if held for 2 min. partially pyrolysed oils showed a radical scavenging capacity 30-700 times greater than the corresponding non-pyrolysed oils. hplc-pad revealed the presence of additional constituents not present in the fresh essential oil. conclusion: these results, by showing enhanced antimicrobial and antioxidant activities, provide the first known western scientific justification for the smoking ceremonies involving leaves of eremophila longifolia. during customary use, both partially pyrolysed as well as  non-pyrolysed essential oils may contribute significantly to the overall intended medicinal effect.

TI  == contemporary revision penile prosthesis surgery is not associated with a high risk of implant colonization or infection: a single-surgeon series.
AB  == introduction: revision penile prosthesis surgery has traditionally been associated with a greater risk of postoperative infection than primary implant placement. this has been attributed to the high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteria found surrounding the implant at the time of revision surgery. aim: to validate whether contemporary revision surgery remains associated with a high risk of asymptomatic colonization and postoperative infection. methods: a comprehensive, prospective database consisting of consecutive patients undergoing primary and revision penile prosthesis surgery at our center was analyzed. main outcome measures: the infection risk in primary and revision implant surgery was  compared. the prevalence of asymptomatic implant colonization during revision surgery, and whether this was associated with clinical infection was evaluated. the spectrum of bacterial species causing infection in this contemporary single-surgeon series was described. results: one hundred seventeen primary and 72 revision implant recipients were studied. infection developed in four (3.4%) patients undergoing primary implants, two (4.3%) patients undergoing removal and  replacement for mechanical malfunction, and three (12%) patients undergoing rerouting for extrusion (p = 0.26). intraoperative cultures were positive in 5 (9.8%) of 51 revision patients, none of whom developed infections. organisms causing infection included staphylococcus aureus and enterobacter aerogenes. unexpectedly, an adjuvant, alcohol-based skin prep in our last 83 patients reduced the infection risk to 1.2%. conclusions: in our series, the infection risk associated with revision of malfunctioning devices was no greater than primary implant placement. rerouting was associated with a higher infection risk, likely due to technical factors, and not implant colonization. less than 10% of our revision implants were colonized, and this had no bearing on the development  of a postoperative infection. s. epidermidis was not the most common organism implicated in device infections. finally, our experience with an adjuvant, alcohol-based skin prep warrants further randomized prospective evaluation.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the canward 2007-2009 study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. all  staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (mic(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/ml and 2 mug/ml, respectively). ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), </=  0.06 mug/ml), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic(90), </= 0.06 mug/ml), staphylococcus epidermidis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml), and enterococcus faecalis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml). over 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/ml. ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and k. pneumoniae. the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus  pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (mic(90), 16 mug/ml). the  broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.

TI  == isothiocyanate profile and selective antibacterial activity of root, stem, and leaf extracts derived from raphanus sativus l.
AB  == acetone and hexane extracts derived from the root, stem, and leaf of raphanus sativus were investigated for their antibacterial activity against foodborne and  resistant pathogens, such as bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, and escherichia coli. total and individual isothiocyanate (itc) components and their relationship with the antibacterial activity of r. sativus were also evaluated. both acetone and hexane fractions of root, stem, and leaf exhibited selective antibacterial activity against the organisms tested. antibacterial activity was strongest in the acetone fraction of root with larger zone of inhibition and lower minimum inhibitory concentration. the results obtained were comparable to that seen with standard antibiotics. of the different parts of r. sativus studied, root tended to be more active than the stem and leaf extracts in inhibiting the bacterial growth. gas chromatographic analysis revealed the presence of variable amounts of five different itcs such as allyl isothiocyanate (aitc), phenyl isothiocyanate (pitc), benzyl isothiocyanate (bitc), phenethyl isothiocyanate, and 4-(methylthio)-3-butenyl isothiocyanate (mtbitc) in different parts of the plant. the low linear correlation between the total itc content and antibacterial activity implied that bacterial growth inhibitory ability of r. sativus was not dependent on the total itc content. however, the antibacterial activity of r. sativus was well correlated with aitc, pitc, and bitc for all organisms except for enteroc. faecalis, whose inhibitory effect was more related to mtbitc.

TI  == effect of linear alkylbenzene sulfonates on the growth of aerobic heterotrophic cultivable bacteria isolated from an agricultural soil.
AB  == an enrichment culture technique was used to isolate soil bacteria capable of growing in the presence of two different concentrations of linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (las) (10 and 500 microg ml(-1)). nine bacterial strains, representatives of the major colony types of aerobic heterotrophic cultivable bacteria in the enriched samples, were isolated and subsequently identified by pcr-amplification and partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. amongst the isolates, strains las05 (pseudomonas syringae), las06 (staphylococcus epidermidis), las07 (delftia tsuruhatensis), las08 (staphylococcus epidermidis) and las09 (enterobacter aerogenes), were able to grow in pure culture in dialysed soil media amended with las (50 microg ml(-1)). the three gram-negative strains grew to higher cell numbers in the presence of 50 microg ml(-1) of las, compared  to las-unamended dialysed soil medium, and were selected for further testing of their ability to use las as carbon source. however, hplc analysis of culture supernatants showed that the three strains can tolerate but not degrade las when  grown in pure cultures. a higher concentration of soluble phosphates was recorded in dialysed soil media amended with las (50 microg ml(-1)) compared to unamended  control media, suggesting an effect of the surfactant that enhanced the bioavailability of p from soil. the presence of las at a concentration of 50 microg ml(-1) had an important impact on growth of selected aerobic heterotrophic soil bacteria, a deleterious effect which may be relevant for the normal function and evolution of agricultural soil.

TI  == decontamination effects of low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge.  part ii: new insights.
AB  == the second part of our paper presents the results of experiments with the decontamination of surfaces by low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge in air at atmospheric pressure. a simple device is described and the effects of the corona discharge on model microorganisms, viz. the yeast candida albicans, gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, neisseria sicca, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, gram-positive bacteria deinococcus radiodurans, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus sanguinis, and vegetative and spore forms of geobacillus stearothermophilus are discussed. a similar microbicidal effect after about one-minute exposure was observed in all vegetative forms of the microorganisms. measurement in growth inhibition zones on a semisolid medium was used to determine the dependence of the microbicidal effect on exposure time and the distance between electrodes. counting of colonies served to assess the microbicidal effect of the discharge on contaminated inert surfaces observable after more than 1 min exposure. geobacillus stearothermophilus spores were found to have several times lower susceptibility to the action of the discharge and the microbicidal effect was observed only after an 8 min exposure. reaction with the iodide reagent did not unambiguously demonstrate the difference between ozone and singlet oxygen as presumed active components of the corona. the area distribution of reactive oxygen species was determined; it was found to differ from the wartburg law depending on exposure time. qualitative evidence was obtained on the penetration  of the reactive oxygen species into the semisolid medium.

TI  == chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of four different anatolian propolis samples.
AB  == propolis means a gum that is gathered by bees from various plants. it is known for its biological properties, having antibacterial, antifungal and healing properties. the aims of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of four different anatolian propolis samples on different groups of microorganisms including some oral pathogens and comparison between their chemical compositions. ethanol extracts of propolis (eep) were prepared from four different anatolian propolis samples and examined whether eep inhibit the growth of the test microorganisms or not. for the antimicrobial activity assays, minimum inhibitory  concentrations (mic) were determined by using macrodilution method. the mic values of the most effective propolis (tb) were 2 microg/ml for streptococcus sobrinus and enterococcus faecalis, 4 microg/ml for micrococcus luteus, candida albicans and c. krusei, 8 microg/ml for streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterobacter aerogenes, 16 microg/ml for escherichia coli and c. tropicalis and 32 microg/ml for salmonella typhimurium and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the chemical compositions of eep's were determined by high-temperature high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. the main compounds of four anatolian propolis samples were flavonoids such as pinocembrin, pinostropin, isalpinin, pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine and chrysin. although propolis samples were collected from different regions of anatolia all showed significant antimicrobial activity against the gram positive bacteria and yeasts. propolis can prevent dental caries since it demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms such as streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus and c. albicans, which involves in oral diseases.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16srdna oligonucleotide array].
AB  == objective: the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. however conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological  assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. on the basis of special gene sequence, pcr provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. but it is  difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic  agents. oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of  target genes. the objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the pcr product of 16srdna using a pair of universal  primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. methods: by comparison and analysis of the 16srdna sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. a pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight  species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. the probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of pcr  using the universal primers. results: the universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, neisseria meningitides, citrobacter freundii, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human dna as control. the results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could  not hybridize with other bacteria. the lowest concentration of dna (product of pcr) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. the results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. the results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. from the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common  infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. conclusions: despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system,  which contains amplification of the segment of 16rdna from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of pcr products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == evaluation of the hyplex bloodscreen multiplex pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  == we evaluated the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) system (bag, lich, germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification  of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive bactec 9240 blood culture bottles. the test involves amplification of the bacterial dna by multiplex pcr and subsequent hybridization  of the pcr product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an elisa-based format. the available probes allow the separate detection of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal meca  gene. the hyplex bloodscreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (s. aureus, 100%; s. epidermidis, 97.2%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). the specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (escherichia coli, 92.5%; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; klebsiella spp., 100%; enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; s. aureus, 100%, s. epidermidis, 97.7%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus  faecium, 99.6%; streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). the result of the meca gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of staphylococcus aureus investigated. in conclusion, the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-elisa system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the meca gene of staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.

TI  == evaluation of the uro-quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  == the ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. these pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. these infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer  generations of antibiotics. in this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis  and endophthalmitis. the ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis. mic90 values for the drugs  against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/ml to 0.57 mg/ml and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. the mic90 for gatifloxacin against streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/ml compared with 0.73 mg/ml for moxifloxacin (p = .011). among the gram-negative isolates, the mean mic90 for gatifloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/ml compared with 2.60 mg/ ml for moxifloxacin (p = .023).  mic90 values for gatifloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. for the atypicals, the mic90 values for gatifloxacin against nocardia asteroides and mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.

TI  == [prostate histopathology of nih category iv prostatitis detected by sextant prostate needle biopsy from the patients with high prostatic specific antigen].
AB  == asymptomatic prostatitis is classified as category iv in nih classification of prostatitis syndrome (1999). no report concerning this category has been present. we investigated this category histopathologically and clinically, in order to clarify the histopathological distribution and its correlation to the clinical features, in this study. among 785 patients who were suspected prostate cancer because of their high prostatic specific antigen (psa) values and to have a sextant prostate needle biopsy was performed between january, 1996 and december,  2000, 88 patients (11.2%) were diagnosed as nih category iv prostatitis (asymptomatic prostatitis). we observed all pathological specimens stained with hematoxylin-eosine, and classified them into subtypes according to the classification criteria for prostatitis defined by true et al. (1999). we also investigated the relationship between histopathological distribution and clinical features such as psa values, psa density, the incidence of pyuria or bacteriuria. in the histopathological study, grade distributions were 12.5% (11/88) in mild, 71.6% (63/88) in moderate, and 15.9% (14/88) in severe. location distributions were 2.3% (2/88) in glandular, 68.2% (60/88) in periglandular, and 29.5% (26/88)  in stromal. no relationship between these subtypes and clinical features was recognized statistically. however, 7 patients (7.95%) were diagnosed as prostate  cancers, later. pyuria was found in 29.1% (23/79). bacteriuria was present in 14.3% (11/77). isolated bacteria were 4 strains of enterococcus faccalis, 2 strains of each of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, and one strain of each of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. gram positive rod, and candida sp. no relationship between these subtypes and bacterial species was recognized. these results indicated that the incidence of niii category iv prostatits was not low without correlation to any clinical features. however, we should pay attention to the presence of prostate cancer, because a small number of the patients were diagnosed as prostate cancer, later.

TI  == comparison of microbial adherence to antiseptic and antibiotic central venous catheters using a novel agar subcutaneous infection model.
AB  == an agar subcutaneous infection model (agar model), which simulates the rat subcutaneous infection model (rat model), was developed to assess the ability of  antimicrobial catheters to resist microbial colonization. the catheters were implanted in the agar and rat models and the insertion sites were infected immediately or on day 7, 14 or 21 post-implantation. the catheters implanted in the agar model were transferred to fresh media one day before infection on day 7, 14 or 21. the efficacy of chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine impregnated (cs)  catheters, cs catheters with higher levels of chlorhexidine (cs+ catheters), minocycline-rifampicin (mr) catheters and silver catheters against staphylococcus aureus and rifampicin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis rif-r2 was compared in the agar and rat models. no significant difference in the adherence or the drug release was found between the in vitro and in vivo models. in both models, cs+ and mr catheters were effective against s. aureus even when infected on day 14, whereas cs catheters were colonized when challenged on day 7. cs+ catheters were  effective against s. epidermidis rif-r2, whereas mr catheters showed adherence when infected on day 7. cs+ catheters prevented colonization of all the organisms including, enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans in the agar model, whereas mr catheters were effective only against s. aureus and s. epidermidis strains. silver catheters were ineffective against all the organisms. the agar model may be used to predict the in vivo efficacy of antimicrobial catheters against various pathogens.

TI  == evaluation of antibacterial efficacy of drugs for urinary tract infections by genotyping based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge).
AB  == we attempted to determine whether the same bacterium isolated from patients with  urinary tract infections (uti) before and after treatment with antimicrobial agents was of the same strain ("persisted") or of a different strain ("changed"). furthermore, to verify the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents for uti, we investigated whether bacterial strains could be classified as persisted or changed based on their electrophoretic patterns in pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). we examined eight species of bacteria ( enterococcus avium, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas fluorescens, serratia marcescens,  citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and escherichia coli), consisting of 41 strains (19 pairs isolated before and after treatment with antimicrobial agents) isolated from patients with complicated uti. it was concluded that all bacteria were unchanged, based on the clinical effect on bacteriuria. the chromosomal dna of these bacteria was digested with restriction enzymes and classified based on their electrophoretic pattern in pfge. a comparison of the patterns of the fragments revealed that 14 pairs were indistinguishable before and after treatment, 3 pairs were closely related, 1 pair was possibly related, and 1 pair was different. these results demonstrated that 18 pairs of isolates (indistinguishable, closely related, and possibly related) were highly likely to be continued infections by the same strain, and that 1 pair (different) had been replaced by another strain. based on these results, we believe that bacterium genotyping by pfge is a more effective method  for evaluating the antibacterial efficacy of antimicrobial agents.

TI  == nb2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  == enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ecta) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. we present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ecta compounds, nb2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of nb2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) nb2001 is a substrate for tem-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/k(m)) of greater than 77,000 m-1 s-1. (ii) triclosan is detected in nb2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli but not in e. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) nb2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing e. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. nb2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae. nb2001 is also active against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae.  the results indicate that nb2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent  and demonstrate the potential of ecta in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.

TI  == multiple organ failure in septic patients.
AB  == multiple organ failure (mof) is the main cause of death in icus, especially affecting septic patients. it is strongly related to number of systems with failure, type of system involved, risk factors such as age, previous chronic diseases, delayed or inadequate resuscitation, persistent infection, immune suppression, and others. the prognoses is worse for patients rather than in elective or emergency surgical patients. the objective of this article is to provide data from our university teaching hospital icu related to the incidence of septic patients, the distribution of mof, and distribution of failure among each of the organs. the mortality rate, relationship between mortality and age, and mortality and types of organs affected were evaluated. the main bacterial causes of sepsis were also identified. a retrospective evaluation was done of 249 patients admitted to the icu in a 4 month period during 1999. fifty four patients had sepsis diagnosed by accs/sccm criteria. there were 37 men and 17 women; 24 medical and 30 post-surgical patients (9 after elective surgery and 21 emergency  patients). apache ii score was calculated on admission and mof, measured for the  first five days, was diagnosed using marshall and meakins criteria. the statistical method used was non-parametric mann-whitney test, p<0.05 was considered significant. the incidence of sepsis was recorded in 54/249 patients (22%). thirty of these 54 patients (56%) died. death occurred in 2 of 11 patients with one organ failure (18%), in 14/27 with 2 or 3 organ failures (52%), and 14/16 with 4 or more organ failures (88%). none of the three patients 15 to 20 years old died, 17/32 (55%) patients age 21-60 years, and >61 years 13/19 (68%),  died. there were 23 patients with positive bacterial culture. the most frequent bacteria found were: pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), multiresistant acinetobacter baumanii (3), staphylococcus epidermidis (3), enterobacter aerogenes (3), klebsiella pneumoniae (2) and multiresistant staphylococcus aureus (2). the mean  value +/- sd of apache ii (mortality risk) for survivors was 21 +/- 18 and for non-survivors 42 +/- 26 (p<0.001). we conclude that mof due to sepsis in an icu is frequent, with high mortality related to the number of failing organs, age and high apache ii.

AB  == resonance raman spectral intensities per average bacterial cell have been measured quantitatively for gram-negative escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, and enterobacter aerogenes, as well as gram-positive bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus epidermidis. spectra have been obtained from cultures in the lag,  log, and stationary growth phases excited in turn by 228.9, 244.0, and 248.2 nm light. although raman spectral peak positions (cm(-1)) excited by a given wavelength are very similar for all five bacterial species, the organisms are characterized by significantly different spectral intensity values. intensity changes are associated with growth phase changes in all of the species as well. a comparison of measured with estimated average intensities has been made for spectra of log-phase e. coli. it is possible to compare measured intensities with intensities estimated for log-phase e. coli on the basis of the knowledge of its  known average cellular molecular composition. a significant degree of hypochromism is observed in e. coli nucleic acid spectra. in contrast, strong average hyperchromism characterizes all aromatic amino acid peaks belonging to the same e. coli cells. results suggest that knowledge of spectral intensity values will enhance significantly the capability to identify bacteria by means of their uv resonance raman spectra.

AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

TI  == development of an infection-resistant lvad driveline: a novel approach to the prevention of device-related infections.
AB  == background: infection remains the single most important challenge to extended left ventricular assist device (lvad) use and often arises from the percutaneous  driveline exit site. we evaluated the ability of an lvad driveline prototype impregnated with chlorhexidine, triclosan, and silver sulfadiazine to resist bacterial and fungal colonization. methods: the spectrum and duration of antimicrobial activity were evaluated in vitro by daily transfer of driveline segments embedded on agar plates inoculated with 10(8) colony-forming units (cfu) of staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), staphlococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, psuedomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans, and then measuring zones of inhibition around the sample subsequent to 24 hours of incubation at 37 degrees c. antimicrobial activity was demonstrated against all organisms for greater than 14 days, and for over 21 days for gram-positive bacteria. to demonstrate in vivo efficacy of the treated driveline, 3-cm segments of driveline were implanted in the dorsal and ventral surface of rats. the exit site was inoculated with 10(6) cfu of s. aureus. after 7 days, driveline segments were aseptically explanted and assayed for bacterial colonization and retention of antimicrobial activity. one hundred percent of control segments were colonized (10(5) cfu s. aureus/cm) as against 13% of the test explants (< or = 330 cfu/cm;  p < 0.0001). results: subcultures of the insertion site and driveline pocket tissue resulted in 10(3) to 10(5) cfu per swab culture for control rats and 0 to  10(2) cfu/swab for test animals. test drivelines retained 80% of anti-s. aureus activity. gross and histological examination of the driveline and surrounding pocket revealed minimal tissue reactivity with positive signs of tissue ingrowth. conclusion: an antimicrobial driveline may prevent early infections and facilitate ingrowth of tissue to provide long-term stability and protection against late infection.

TI  == the bacteriology of neonatal septicaemia in ile-ife, nigeria.
AB  == the incidence of septicaemia among neonates categorized as being at high risk was 55 per cent in ile-ife, nigeria. gram-positive organisms, specifically staphylococcus aureus, were predominant (33.8 per cent) among bacteria cultured from proven cases of septicaemia. other coagulase-negative staphylococci also contributed 21 per cent, with staphylococcus epidermidis occurring in 5 per cent  of the isolates. listeria monocytogenes was cultured from 8.4 per cent of septic  neonates. pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured from 3 per cent, klebsiella pneumoniae from 14 per cent, and escherichia coli from 7 per cent. other gram-negative bacilli cultured were enterobacter aerogenes (5 per cent), citrobacter freundii, salmonella sp., and proteus sp. (2 per cent each). the bacterial isolates were relatively resistant to antibiotics traditionally employed to treat cases of septicaemia. the study shows a high prevalence of neonatal bacterial sepsis at the centre and the emerging role of listeria monocytogenes in the aetiology of neonatal sepsis. it highlights the preponderance of multiple antibiotic resistant organisms among these neonates early in life which is of epidemiological importance in the control of the infectious agents.

TI  == bacteraemia in the adult intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in nottingham, uk, 1985-1996.
AB  == bacteraemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit. in this study the distribution of organisms causing bacteraemic episodes in patients in the adult intensive care unit of a large teaching hospital was determined. particular emphasis was placed on the type of organisms  isolated from community- and hospital-acquired bacteraemia, the suspected source  of infection, the possible risk factors associated with bacteraemia, and outcome. the incidence of bacteraemia and fungaemia increased from 17.7 per 1000 admissions in 1985 to 80.3 in 1996. a total of 315 episodes of bacteraemia and fungaemia were documented over a 12-year period, of which 18% were considered community-acquired and 82% hospital-acquired. gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 46.9% and 31.5% of the episodes, respectively. polymicrobial infection accounted for 17.8% and fungi for 3.8% of the episodes. staphylococcus aureus (22.5%), staphylococcus epidermidis (7.6%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (7.9%) were the predominant gram-positive bacteria implicated, whereas escherichia coli (6%), enterobacter cloacae (7%), klebsiella  aerogenes (3.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.1%), and acinetobacter spp. (3.8%) were the predominant gram-negative bacteria isolated. the two most common sources of infection were the respiratory tract (39.7%) and an intravascular line (24.5%), but in 8.9% of episodes the focus of infection remained unknown. bacteraemic patients stayed in the unit for a longer period (12 days) than did non-bacteraemic patients (3 days). the overall mortality related to bacteraemia and candidaemia was 44.4%. surveillance of bacteraemia in the intensive care unit is important in detecting major changes in aetiology, e.g., the increasing incidence of gram-positive bacteraemia, the emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in 1995, and the emergence of enterobacter cloacae. it is of value in determining empirical antimicrobial therapy to treat presumed infection pending a microbiological diagnosis and in directing the development of guidelines for infection prevention, e.g., guidelines for central venous catheter care.

TI  == pharmacodynamics of fluoroquinolones in experimental models of endocarditis.
AB  == we calculated the magnitude of various serum pharmacodynamic parameters for fluoroquinolones in models of experimental endocarditis (ee) described in the literature. nineteen publications contained data that allowed calculation of these parameters. data were available for eight fluoroquinolones against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, viridans streptococci, enterobacter aerogenes, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in rabbit or rat models. enterococci were excluded because of poor bactericidal activity. a 24-hour area under the concentration curve (auc)/minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) ratio  > or = 100, a peak level/mic ratio > 8, and continuous levels above the time were associated with a significantly lower number of cfu per vegetation after 3-6 days of therapy. the 24-hour auc/mic exhibited the best linear correlation with cfu per vegetation after 3-6 days of therapy (r2 = 45%). the pharmacodynamic parameters predictive of efficacy for fluoroquinolones in the treatment of experimental endocarditis are similar to those for other infectious models.

TI  == [bacteremia after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with and without therapeutic procedure: frequency, associated factors and clinical significance].
AB  == purpose: to determine the frequency, associate factors and clinical features of bacteremia in patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography  (ercp), with or without therapeutic procedures. methods: prospectively, 42 consecutives patients undergoing 46 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies (ercps) from august to december 1994 were analyzed. the search for bacteremia was done by drawing 6 blood samples for cultures from peripheral blood. two blood samples were collected before the ercp and 4 of them  after. the bottles used for cultures were bactec bottles. the bottles were incubated in the bactec 9240 system, and eventual bacteria detect were identificated by the manual routine of the laboratory and also with the autoscan/microscan system. results: all blood cultures obtained before the ercps  were negatives. bacteremia were detected after 7 endoscopic procedures. in two episodes of bacteremia, the microorganism identified (staphylococcus epidermidis) was considered to be a contaminant. the other 5 episodes of bacteremia were considered true bacteremia (frequency- 10.9%), and the microorganisms identified  were: streptococcus viridans, corynebacterium sp., enterobacter cloacae, klebsiello oxytoca and enterobacter aerogenes. this episodes were more frequent in the blood cultures obtained immediately after the ercps (p < 0.05), and occurred exclusively in the patients who were not receiving antibiotics (p = 0.0192). clinical manifestation of the episodes of bacteremia were not detected.  conclusion: the episodes of bacteremia occurred exclusively in the patients who were not receiving antibiotics, were transient and completely no symptomatic.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. the advantages of in vitro activity of fk037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (mic90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (h-mrsa), (3) a strong activity against enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (mic90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for escherichia coli,  0.1 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for haemophilus influenzae and proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis and moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for c. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant s. aureus (l-mrsa), enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for h-mrsa and serratia marcescens.  fk037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except mrsa, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except p. vulgaris and/or m. catarrhalis. the increase in mics of fk037 against 2 l-mrsa strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. fk037 was highly bactericidal against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa at the mic or higher. fk037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against h-mrsa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. against the other strains, fk037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa. transmission electron microscopic  studies revealed that fk037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in mrsa after 4 h incubation.

TI  == novel automated microbial screening of platelet concentrates.
AB  == the recovery of bacteria and the speed of detection of microbial growth in platelet concentrates (pc) were studied, comparing a novel automated blood culture system (bact/alert) with two traditional methods. full-scale experiments  were performed with a total of 33 units of pc (average content 320 x 10(9) platelets per unit) obtained from pooled buffy coats. six strains known as possible pc contaminants were tested: s. epidermidis, s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, b. cereus, e. aerogenes, and s. sanguis. using an inoculum of 50-98 bacteria/ml,  bacterial contamination was detected in all of 11 pcs on 132 sampling occasions.  with a small inoculum (0.3-9 bacteria/ml), the bacterial contamination was detected in all pcs in which abundant growth appeared, but failed to be detected  in some instances where the bacterial content was very small. all of 11 uninoculated pc controls were negative. with the automated method the time for detection of a culture-positive pc was 6-16 h, clearly shorter than with the two  manual-visual systems. the new system provides a rapid, reliable, and labour-saving method for screening of bacterial contamination in pcs. this would  increase safety particularly if the present 5-day shelf life were extended.

TI  == in vitro survival of skin flora in heparin locks and needleless valve infusion devices.
AB  == objective: to determine the extent to which two types of infusion devices, the heparin lock and a needleless valve device, allowed the persistence of inoculated microorganisms. design: experiment. setting: clinical microbiology laboratory. outcome measures: bacterial counts in infusion devices. intervention: five of each type of device were inoculated with approximately 10(5) colony-forming units of a strain of staphylococcus epidermidis and enterobacter aerogenes and tested for growth at seven time intervals, from 10 minutes to 72 hours after inoculation. results: both strains of bacteria were present in each device at every time interval tested, including 72 hours after inoculation. conclusions: bacteria introduced into a heparin lock or valve device may be isolated for prolonged periods of time. this suggests that if such devices are contaminated during use, they may be a potential source of infection. the risk of infection should be one major consideration in risk and benefit deliberations when choosing new products.

AB  == sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz) is a preparation containing cpz and sbt, an inhibitor of beta-lactamases, at the ratio 1:1. the reliability of the sbt/cpz disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics and the utilization of the test in the evaluation of proper administrative doses were studied using 365 strains of clinical isolates. the antimicrobial activity of sbt/cpz was stronger than that of cpz alone. this increase in the antimicrobial activity due to the addition of sbt was well observed in the disc diffusion susceptibility test and mic values. the mic80 of sbt/cpz against staphylococcus aureus was 12.5 micrograms/ml, while that of cpz alone was 50 micrograms/ml. mic80s of sbt/cpz against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes were smaller than those of cpz, and were 0.20, 12.5, 25 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. however, mic80s of sbt/cpz against staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and  proteus vulgaris were not changed compared to those of cpz alone, and mic80s were 6.25, 0.20, 0.78, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. the reliability of the sbt/cpz disc diffusion susceptibility test in the quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs prepared in this laboratory, both of which  contained 30 micrograms of cpz and 30 micrograms of sbt. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the sbt/cpz disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of approximate mic values. to interpret results of the showa sbt/cpz disc test, the following 4 category classification was used: ( inverted question mark) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark 3 micrograms/ml less than mic  less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark15 micrograms/ml  less than mic less than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. in both 6 and 8 mm diameter disc tests, when uniform break points  of inhibitory zone diameter were similarly applied to all strains isolated clinically, some strains of s. aureus, e. faecalis, and p. aeruginosa, brought false positive (susceptible) results showing slightly greater inhibitory zone diameters compared to mics. however, if different break points against p. aeruginosa as indicated in this study were applied and e. faecalis was excluded from the test, excellent results were obtained in the quantitative estimation of  mics. antimicrobial activities of antibiotic agents have been reported to be reduced by serum protein binding.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating the effective administrative dose of latamoxef. significance of a 4-category system interpretation of the latamoxef disc susceptibility test].
AB  == in vitro activities of latamoxef (lmox) against 249 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. lmox was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis (except 2 out of 30 strains) and proteus vulgaris with mic values below 3.13 micrograms/ml. it was also active against enterobacter aerogenes with mic80  of 1.56 micrograms/ml. lmox was less active against serratia marcescens, inhibiting about 43% of strains at a level of 6.25 micrograms/ml. it was also less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, showing mic80 of 12.5 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. lmox was not active against enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the reliability of the lmox disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (difco), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of lmox. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the lmox disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of lmox. for the interpretation of lmox disc test results, if uniform break points of zone diameters were used to test all bacteria, inhibitory zone diameters of showa discs used on staphylococcus were relatively large compared to mics determined, probably due to decarboxylation of lmox sodium salt in the discs. however, those of difco discs were not, because difco discs use lmox ammonium salt. both discs also showed relatively large inhibitory zone diameters  compared to mics determined against p. aeruginosa. using different break points from those used for other bacteria to interpret inhibition zones for staphylococcus and p. aeruginosa, these disc susceptivility tests should be useful to estimate approximate mics. a 3 category system for the interpretation of disc test results has been used in usa and europe, but a 4 category system is  generally used in japan. the 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to mic values as follows:  resistant (r) mic greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml, intermediate (i) mic 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (s) mic less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. the 4 category system uses break points as follows: mic less than  or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == efficacy of imipenem/cilastatin in endocarditis.
AB  == imipenem, a potent new beta-lactam antibiotic, which is bactericidal against most pathogenic bacteria, and cilastatin, a dehydropeptidase inhibitor combined with imipenem to prevent the metabolism of imipenem in the kidney, were evaluated in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis. seventeen patients, including 14 who used intravenous drugs, were treated with imipenem/cilastatin in a dose of 500 mg each infused over 30 minutes every six hours. the mean duration of treatment was  29 days with a range of 21 to 56 days. causative bacteria were staphylococcus aureus in 10 patients, s. aureus plus group b streptococcus in one, viridans group streptococcus in two, neisseria subflava, eikenella corrodens, and group g  streptococcus in one patient, and staphylococcus epidermidis, hemophilus aphrophilus, and enterobacter aerogenes in one patient each. the minimal bactericidal concentration of imipenem against 16 of 18 isolates tested was 0.04  micrograms/ml, 1 microgram/ml against h. aphrophilus, and 0.4 micrograms/ml against e. aerogenes. the site of infection was the right side of the heart in 11 patients, the left side in five, and both sides in one. the mean number of days to defervescence was 9.7. all patients were cured, and none required cardiac surgery. adverse effects were few and interrupted treatment occurred in only one  patient who had acute dyspnea during an infusion on day 26 of therapy. imipenem/cilastatin appears to be a relatively safe and highly effective treatment of staphylococcal endocarditis in intravenous drug users; too few patients with endocarditis caused by other bacteria were treated to allow a firm  statement about efficacy in non-staphylococcal endocarditis.

TI  == distribution and effects of a defined six-member murine-derived microflora in gnotobiotic gerbils.
AB  == the gnotobiotic gerbil was selected as a model with which to study the effects of colonization with a defined microflora on organ morphology, histology, and selected blood biochemical parameters. gerbils were maintained germfree for 13 months but failed to reproduce, presumably because of the enlarged cecum. a colony of gnotobiotic gerbils that was associated with a bacterial flora consisting of lactobacillus brevis, streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacteroides vulgatus, enterobacter aerogenes, and a fusobacterium sp. was established. these gnotobiotic gerbils had smaller ceca than germfree gerbils and proved capable of reproduction. except for the presence of large numbers of bacteroides organisms in the stomach and greater numbers of s. epidermidis in gnotobiotic gerbils, the number and location of gastrointestinal bacteria were similar in conventional and gnotobiotic gerbils. bacteroides sp. was the second most predominant microorganism present in gnotobiotic gerbils, whereas clostridia were reported to be the second most predominant microorganism  in conventional gerbils. microscopic examination of direct-impression smears indicated that fusobacteria were present on mucosal surfaces. intestines of gnotobiotic gerbils weighed twice as much as the intestines of conventional gerbils. intestinal tissue water weight values from conventional and gnotobiotic  gerbils were similar. histological examination of gerbil intestinal tissue revealed no cellular hypertrophy and no evidence of inflammation in gnotobiotic gerbil intestines. spleens of gnotobiotic gerbils showed no germinal center stimulation. statistical differences in total serum glucose, serum protein, and hematocrit levels were found between conventional and gnotobiotic gerbils.

AB  == the growth-inhibiting behaviour of abacterial, liquid pure cultures made up of three water algae (hydrodictyon reticulatum, chlorella vulgaris, aphanothece nidulans) which were made to grow profusely in special culture containers under constant exposure to light and ventilation was examined in ten different species  of microorganisms during a period of contact of 4 days both in the light and in the dark. subjected to the test were the 5 pathogenic species staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium and  candida albicans as well the 5 bacterial contamination indicators e. coli (faecal indicator), streptococcus faecalis (enterococci), enterobacter aerogenes ("coliforms"), staphylococcus epidermidis (dermic germ) and bacillus subtilis ("contamination germ"). it was found that --hydrodictyon reticulatum and aphanothece nidulans exert a strong antibacterial effect, while chlorella vulgaris provides no indication of a bacterial growth-inhibiting effect. --this antibiosis is linked with the assimilative activity of the algal cultures, as in  the dark no antibacterial action is discernible --the "antibiotic principle" must be liable to transitory or rapid disintegration because the algal cultures are ineffective in the dark and also culture filtrates of 5-days old algal cultures exercise no growth-inhibiting effect. with respect to the sanitation of waters it is important to state that a profuse growth of algae produces a certain, but hardly reliable "biological water disinfection" and renders difficult the assessment of the quality of a water-course as a result of the elimination of the usual contamination indicators. therefore, additional microbiological quality parameters must be used for assessment of pollution of swimming pools with strong algal growth.

AB  == units of blood were intentionally contaiminated with suspensions of either aerobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, enterobacter cloacae,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, sarcina lutea, seratia marcesens, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, paracolabacterum aerogenoides (enterobacter  hafriae), mima polymorpha or acinetobacter- calcoaceticus. when inoculation was made prior to glycerolization, the subsequent glycerolization, freezing, thawing, and deglycerolization resulted in roughly a two log reduction in the number of bacteria. when inoculation was made with a final concentration of between 10(1) and 10(5) organisms per milliliter, immediately following deglycerolization or following washing without glycerolization and freezing, no increase in the number of bacteria was seen after 72 hours storage at 4 c. three of the 12 organisms studied decreased in number during 72 hours of storage. these data suggest that the current 24-hour limit on the post-thaw storage of frozen red blood cells may  be unnecessarily restrictive.

TI  == serum bacteriostasis of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == serum bacteriostasis of staphylococcus aureus was characterized quantitatively and quantitatively. bacteriostasis was proportional to the concentration of serum. reproducibility was good; freezing and thawing did not materially affect the end point. four of six different strains, including the propagating s. aureus strain for phage 73 which does not produce coagulase, were susceptible to serum bacteriostasis in similar titers; two were not susceptible at all. all six strains were effective inhibitors of bacteriostasis. active and inactive coagulase were also inhibitors. in contrast to sensitive s. aureus, s. epidermidis and streptococcus salivarius were not uniformly susceptible to bacteriostasis by different serums. escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella montevideo, s. zymogenes, and diplococcus pneumoniae were not susceptible. among gram-positive bacteria, only d. pneumoniae inhibited s. aureus bacteriostasis. agglutinins of s. aureus and nonspecific substances such as lysozyme, beta-lysin, c-reactive protein, and transferrin were not responsible for s. aureus serum bacteriostasis. after diethylaminoethyl column fractionation of serum, the bacteriostatic principle was eluted in proximity to blood group antibody; immunoglobulins a, g, and m appeared to be present in bacteriostatic fractions. it is suggested that s. aureus bacteriostasis by serum is due to natural antibody and that inhibitory reactions  with pneumococci and coagulase are due to common antigens.

TI  == bacteriostatic action of progesterone on staphylococci and other microorganisms.
AB  == yotis, william (loyola university, hines, ill.), and ronald stanke. bacteriostatic action of progesterone on staphylococci and other microorganisms.  j. bacteriol. 92:1285-1289. 1966.-progesterone has been examined in vitro for antibacterial activity against 10 microorganisms. turbidimetric and manometric techniques were used to assay the antibacterial activity of progesterone. the organisms tested consisted of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, gaffkya tetragena, bacillus subtilis, listeria monocytogenes, candida albicans, escherichia coli, aerobacter aerogenes, salmonella paratyphi, and proteus vulgaris. antibacterial action was shown by progesterone only against the gram-positive microorganisms when they were grown in tryptic soy broth containing 10 to 20 mug of progesterone per ml. pregnenolone, 4-pregnen-20beta-ol-3-one, and 5alpha-pregnane also possessed antistaphylococcal properties, whereas pregnanolone, pregnandione, 11alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, and 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone did not. the bacteriostatic action of progesterone on staphylococci was exerted primarily during the first 8 hr of incubation, and it was reduced in the presence of oxygen. in the presence of 20 mug of progesterone  per ml, there was significant reduction in the oxidation by resting staphylococcal suspensions or utilization by staphylococci of pyruvate as an energy source during growth.
