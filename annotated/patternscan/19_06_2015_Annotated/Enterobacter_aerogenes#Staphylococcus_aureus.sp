TI  == antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities from jatropha dioica roots.
AB  == the antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of organic extracts obtained from roots of the medicinal plant jatropha dioica (euphorbiaceae) were investigated. in order to evaluate their antimicrobial activity, the organic extracts were tested against clinical isolates of the human pathogens bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, salmonella typhimurium, cryptococcus neoformans, candida albicans, candida parapsilosis and sporothrix schenckii. results revealed that the hexane extract possess the stronger activity and a broader microbicide spectrum compared to the acetone and ethanol extracts. the activity of hexane extract may be attributed in part to the presence of beta-sitosterol, the major compound identified by bioautography. the hexane extract, as well as the bioactive fraction were not cytotoxic when assays were profiled against the normal cell lines chang, ok and llcpk-1 (ic50>1000 mug ml(-1)).

TI  == proteolytic and antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria grown in goat milk.
AB  == we examined 62 strains and 21 trade starter cultures from the collection of lb bulgaricum plc for proteolytic and antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) grown in goat milk. the aim of this study was to investigate the fermentation of caseins, alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin by lab, using the o-phthaldialdehyde (opa) spectrophotometric assay and sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page). the proteolysis targeted mainly caseins, especially beta-casein. whey proteins were proteolyzed, essentially beta-lactoglobulin. the proteolytic activity of lactococcus lactis l598, streptococcus thermophilus t3d1, dt1, lactobacillus lactis 1043 and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus b38, b122 and b24 was notably high. the proteolysis process gave rise to medium-sized peptide populations. most of the examined strains showed antimicrobial activity against some food pathogens, such as escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella cholere enteridis, listeria monocytogenes, listeria innocua and enterobacter aerogenes. the most active producers of antimicrobial-active peptides were strains of l. delbrueckii subsp.  bulgaricus and s. thermophilus, which are of practical importance. the starter cultures containing the examined species showed high proteolytic and antimicrobial activity in skimmed goat milk. the greatest antimicrobial activity  of the cultures was detected against e. aerogenes. the obtained results demonstrated the significant proteolytic potential of the examined strains in goat milk and their potential for application in the production of dairy products from goat's milk. the present results could be considered as the first data on the proteolytic capacity of strains and starter cultures in goat milk for the purposes of trade interest of lb bulgaricum plc.

TI  == bacterial community structure in treated sewage sludge with mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic digestion.
AB  == stabilized sewage sludge is applied to agricultural fields and farmland due to its high organic matter content. the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of two types of sludge stabilization, mesophilic anaerobic digestion (mad) and thermophilic anaerobic digestion (tad), on bacterial communities in sludge, including the presence of pathogenic microorganisms. bacterial community  structure and phylogenetic diversity were analyzed in four sewage sludge samples  from the czech republic. analysis of 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) genes showed that investigated sludge samples harbor diverse bacterial populations with only a few  taxa present across all samples. bacterial diversity was higher in sludge samples after mad versus tad treatment, and communities in mad-treated sludge shared the  highest genetic similarities. in all samples, the bacterial community was dominated by reads affiliated with proteobacteria. the sludge after tad treatment had considerably higher number of reads of thermotolerant/thermophilic taxa, such as the phyla deinococcus-thermus and thermotogae or the genus coprothermobacter.  only one operational taxonomic unit (otu), which clustered with rhodanobacter, was detected in all communities at a relative abundance >1 %. all of the communities were screened for the presence of 16s rrna gene sequences of pathogenic bacteria using a database of 122 pathogenic species and >/=98 % identity threshold. the abundance of such sequences ranged between 0.23 and 1.57  % of the total community, with lower numbers present after the tad treatment, indicating its higher hygienization efficiency. sequences clustering with nontuberculous mycobacteria were present in all samples. other detected sequences of pathogenic bacteria included streptomyces somaliensis, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, alcaligenes faecalis, gordonia spp., legionella anisa, bordetella  bronchiseptica, enterobacter aerogenes, brucella melitensis, and staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == repurposing salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs to combat drug resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive bacterium that has become the leading cause of hospital acquired infections in the us. repurposing food and drug administration (fda) approved drugs for antimicrobial therapy involves lower risks and costs compared to de novo development of novel antimicrobial agents. in this study, we examined the antimicrobial properties of two commercially available anthelmintic drugs. the fda approved drug niclosamide and the veterinary drug oxyclozanide displayed strong in vivo and in vitro activity against methicillin resistant s. aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic):  0.125 and 0.5 mug/ml respectively; minimum effective concentration: </= 0.78 mug/ml for both drugs). the two drugs were also effective against another gram-positive bacteria enterococcus faecium (mic 0.25 and 2 mug/ml respectively), but not against the gram-negative species klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter aerogenes. the in vitro antimicrobial activity of niclosamide and oxyclozanide were determined against methicillin, vancomycin, linezolid or daptomycin resistant s. aureus clinical isolates, with mics at 0.0625-0.5 and 0.125-2 mug/ml for niclosamide and oxyclozanide respectively. a time-kill study demonstrated that niclosamide is bacteriostatic, whereas oxyclozanide is bactericidal. interestingly, oxyclozanide permeabilized the bacterial membrane but neither of the anthelmintic drugs exhibited demonstrable toxicity to sheep erythrocytes. oxyclozanide was non-toxic to hepg2 human liver carcinoma cells within the range of its in vitro mics but niclosamide displayed toxicity even at low concentrations. these data show that the salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs niclosamide and oxyclozanide are suitable candidates for mechanism of action studies and further clinical evaluation for treatment of staphylococcal infections.

TI  == 2-alkyl(aryl)-quinazolin-4(3h)-thiones, 2-r-(quinazolin-4(3h)-ylthio)carboxylic acids and amides: synthesis, molecular docking, antimicrobial and anticancer properties.
AB  == in this study, a series of novel 2-alkyl(aryl)-quinazolin-4(3h)-thiones, 2-r-(quinazolin-4(3h)-ylthio)carboxylic acids and amides were synthesized and evaluated for antimicrobial and anticancer activities. their structure was confirmed by elemental analysis and spectral data (ft-ir, lc-ms, 1h-nmr). antimicrobial activity was tested in vitro against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, candida albicans and nci in vitro preliminary anticancer activity against nine different cancer types. the most active antibacterial and antifungal compounds were: 2.1, 2.2 and 2.4. the introduction of the carboxylic acid or amide residue into the fourth position of  quinazolin-4(3h)-thione resulted in the absence of antimicrobial activity. substance 3.8 inhibited renal cancer uo-31 line and 2.18 - leukemia ccrf-cem. the results of in silico molecular docking for dhfr and ck2 kinase had no correlation with in vitro properties, proposing the presence of other biological activity pathways.

TI  == spectral and biological evaluation of a synthetic antimicrobial peptide derived from 1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid.
AB  == ac-gf(a6c)g(a6c)k(a6c)g(a6c)f(a6c)g(a6c)gk(a6c)kkkk-amide (a6c=1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid) is a synthetic antimicrobial peptide (amp) that exhibits in vitro inhibitory activity against drug resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterococcus faecium at concentrations ranging from 10.9 to 43mum. spectroscopic investigations were conducted to determine how this  amp interacts with simple membrane model systems in order to provide insight into possible mechanisms of action. cd and 2d-(1)h nmr experiments indicated this amp  on binding to sds and dpc micelles adopts conformations with varying percentages  of helical and random coil conformers. cd investigations in the presence of three phospholipid suvs consisting of popc, 4:1 popc/popg, and 60% pope/21%popg/19%popc revealed: (1) the interactions occurring with popc suvs have minimal effect on the conformational diversity of the amp yielding conformations similar to those observed in buffer. (2) the interactions with 4:1 popc/popg, and 60% pope/21%popg/19%popc suvs exhibited a greater influence on the percentage of different conformers contributing to the cd spectra. (3) the presence of a high of percentage of helical conformers was not observed in the presence of suvs as was the case with micelles. this data indicates that the diversity of surface bound conformations adopted by this amp are very different from the diversity of  conformations adopted by this amp on insertion into the lipid bilayer. cd spectra of this amp in the presence of suvs consisting of lps isolated from p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae and escherichia coli exhibited characteristics associated with various helical conformations.

TI  == safety, efficacy and utility of methods of transferring adhesive and cohesive escherichia coli cells to microplates to avoid aerosols.
AB  == the virtual colony count (vcc) microbiological assay has been utilized for over a decade to measure the antimicrobial activity of peptides such as defensins and ll-37 against biosafety level (bsl)-1 and bsl-2 bacteria including escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and enterobacter aerogenes. in addition, a modified pipetting technique was presented in a 2011 study of defensin activity against the bsl-3 pathogen bacillus anthracis. both studies were published in the journal antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy. here i report that the method can also detect cross-contamination caused by aerosols utilizing the vcc method of data analysis by quantitative growth kinetics (qgk).  the qgk threshold time, or t t, equivalent to the cycle time c t reported in 1996 by heid et al., precisely identifies when wells were inoculated.

TI  == effect of white mustard essential oil on the growth of foodborne pathogens and spoilage microorganisms and the effect of food components on its efficacy.
AB  == antimicrobial preservative compounds are added to foods to target specific pathogens and spoilage organisms. white mustard essential oil (wmeo) is an extract that contains 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate, a compound which has been demonstrated to have antimicrobial activity in limited studies. the objective of  this research was to determine the in vitro antimicrobial activity of wmeo against gram-positive and gram-negative spoilage and pathogenic bacteria and determine the effect of food components on the antimicrobial activity. the bacteria escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, enterobacter  aerogenes, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, and lactobacillus fermentum, as well as the acid- and preservative-resistant yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe, were evaluated. all microorganisms were inhibited by wmeo at 8.3 g/liter (equivalent to 1,000 mg/liter 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate). in general, wmeo was more effective against gram-negative than against gram-positive bacteria. salmonella enteritidis and s. pombe were the most sensitive, with inhibition at as low as 2.1 g/liter. the effects on growth profiles varied but included increased lag phases and lethality, indicating both  bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity. soybean oil had a negative effect on the efficacy of wmeo against l. monocytogenes, and at 5% soybean oil, the antimicrobial activity against salmonella enteritidis was eliminated after 48 h.  sodium caseinate at 1% also negated the antimicrobial effect of wmeo against salmonella enteritidis and decreased its effectiveness against l. monocytogenes.  the presence of starch had no significant effect on the antimicrobial activity of wmeo against l. monocytogenes and salmonella enteritidis. thus, wmeo is effective against a wide range of microorganisms and has potential to be used in foods, depending upon the target microorganism and food components present.

TI  == decoction, infusion and hydroalcoholic extract of cultivated thyme: antioxidant and antibacterial activities, and phenolic characterisation.
AB  == bioactivity of thyme has been described, but mostly related to its essential oils, while studies with aqueous extracts are scarce. herein, the antioxidant and antibacterial properties of decoction, infusion and hydroalcoholic extract, as also their phenolic compounds, were evaluated and compared. decoction showed the  highest concentration of phenolic compounds (either phenolic acids or flavonoids), followed by infusion and hydroalcoholic extract. in general, the samples were effective against gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis) and gram-negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus aerogenes, proteus vulgaris and enterobacter sakazakii) bacteria, with decoction presenting the most pronounced effect. this sample also displayed the highest radical scavenging activity and reducing power. data obtained support the idea that compounds with strong antioxidant and antibacterial activities are also water-soluble. furthermore, the use of thyme infusion and decoction, by both internal and external use, at recommended doses,  is safe and no adverse reactions have been described.

TI  == screening and characterisation of antimicrobial properties of semisynthetic betulin derivatives.
AB  == betulin (lup-20(29)-ene-3beta, 28-diol) is a naturally occurring triterpene, which is found in substantial amounts from the outer bark of birch trees. a library of 51 structurally diverse semisynthetic betulin derivatives was screened against five bacterial strains, enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and a fungal strain candida albicans, using broth microdilution assays. primary antimicrobial  screening at 50 microm concentration led to the identification of five compounds  showing antimicrobial properties (inhibition of growth by >70% against one or more microbial strains). according to the dose-response results, 28-o-(n-acetylanthraniloyl)betulin (compound 5) was the most active, showing mic90 of 6.25 microm against two gram-positive bacteria, e. faecalis and s. aureus. however, the activity of this compound was affected by albumin binding, which was demonstrated by the loss of activity in a host-pathogen co-culture assay as well as in the antibacterial assay in the presence of increased concentration of albumin. furthermore, the effects on mammalian cells were evaluated by cytotoxicity assessment on hepatocyte cell culture after 24 h exposure to the compounds. betulinic aldehyde (18), betulin-28-oxime (31) and hetero cycloadduct with acetoxy groups at carbon atoms 3 and 28 and ethyl substituent at the triazolo ring (43) displayed cytotoxicity towards hepatocytes, with ic50 values of 47, 25 and 16 microm, respectively. the ic50 value for 28-o-(n-acetylanthraniloyl)betulin (5) was 56 microm. the current study presents  an insight into using betulin scaffold for developing derivatives with antibacterial potential, and furthermore the necessity of in-depth analysis of found actives through selectivity profiling and follow-up studies including in silico admet predictions.

TI  == silver sucrose octasulfate (iasos) as a valid active ingredient into a novel vaginal gel against human vaginal pathogens: in vitro antimicrobial activity assessment.
AB  == this in vitro study assessed the antimicrobial properties of a novel octasilver salt of sucrose octasulfate (iasos) as well as of an innovative vaginal gel containing iasos (silsos femme), against bacterial and yeast pathogens isolated from human clinical cases of symptomatic vaginal infections. in bhi and lapt culture media, different ionic silver concentrations and different phs were tested. iasos exerted a strong antimicrobial activity towards all the pathogens tested in both culture media. the results demonstrated that salts and organic compounds present in the culture media influenced iasos efficacy only to a moderate extent. whereas comparable mbcs (minimal bactericidal concentrations) were observed for g. vaginalis (10 mg/l ag+), e. coli and e. aerogenes (25 mg/l ag+) in both media, higher mbcs were found for s. aureus and s. agalactiae in lapt cultures (50 mg/l ag+ versus 25 mg/l ag+). no minimal concentration totally  inhibiting the growth of c. albicans was found. nevertheless, in both media at the highest ionic silver concentrations (50-200 mg/l ag+), a significant 34-52% drop in candida growth was observed. ph differently affected the antimicrobial properties of iasos against bacteria or yeasts; however, a stronger antimicrobial activity at ph higher than the physiological ph was generally observed. it can be therefore concluded that iasos exerts a bactericidal action against all the tested bacteria and a clear fungistatic action against c. albicans. the antimicrobial activity of the whole vaginal gel silsos femme further confirmed the antimicrobial activity of iasos. overall, our findings support iasos as a valid active ingredient into a vaginal gel.

TI  == wound healing activity and mechanisms of action of an antibacterial protein from  the venom of the eastern diamondback rattlesnake (crotalus adamanteus).
AB  == basic phospholipase a2 was identified from the venom of the eastern diamondback rattlesnake. the crotalus adamanteus toxin-ii (catx-ii) induced bactericidal effects (7.8 microg/ml) on staphylococcus aureus, while on burkholderia pseudomallei (khw), and enterobacter aerogenes were killed at 15.6 microg/ml. catx-ii caused pore formation and membrane damaging effects on the bacterial cell wall. catx-ii was not cytotoxic on lung (mrc-5), skin fibroblast (hepk) cells and in mice. catx-ii-treated mice showed significant wound closure and complete healing by 16 days as compared to untreated controls (**p<0.01). histological examination revealed enhanced collagen synthesis and neovascularization after treatment with catx-ii versus 2% fusidic acid ointment (fao) treated controls. measurement of tissue cytokines revealed that interleukin-1 beta (il-1beta) expression in catx-ii treated mice was significantly suppressed versus untreated  controls. in contrast, cytokines involved in wound healing and cell migration i.e., monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (mcp-1), fibroblast growth factor-basic (fgf-b), chemokine (kc), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf) were significantly enhanced in catx-ii treated mice, but not in the controls. catx-ii also modulated nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) activation during skin wound healing. the catx-ii protein highlights distinct snake proteins as a potential source of novel antimicrobial agents with significant therapeutic  application for bacterial skin infections.

AB  == microbial control strategies are needed in the food industry to prevent foodborne illnesses and outbreaks and prolong product shelf life. the aim of this study was to investigate and compare the efficacy of the commercial natural antimicrobials  white mustard essential oil (wmeo), citrus flavonoid and acid blend (cfab), olive extract (oe), nisaplin (a compound containing nisin), and lauric arginate (lae) alone and in combinations against foodborne pathogens and spoilage microorganisms. mics of individual and combined antimicrobials against escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, enterobacter aerogenes, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus were determined at ph 6.0 and 25 degrees c. wmeo was most effective against b. cereus and s. aureus, with mics of 250 and 500 mg/liter, respectively. cfab inhibited all tested microorganisms, requiring only 12 to 35 mg/liter for gram-positive bacteria. for  oe, 2,000 mg/liter was needed to achieve microbial inhibition. nisaplin at 400 to 1,200 mg/liter inhibited only gram-positive bacteria. lae was effective at low concentrations and required only 20 to 50 mg/liter to inhibit all tested microorganisms. when wmeo was combined with other antimicrobials, the effects were usually additive except for wmeo plus nisaplin and wmeo+oe, which had synergistic activity against l. monocytogenes and salmonella enteritidis, respectively. an antagonistic effect was observed for wmeo+cfab against e. aerogenes. for wmeo+lae+cfab, additive antimicrobial effects were noted against all strains tested except s. aureus, where a synergistic effect occurred. these findings suggest that these commercial natural antimicrobials have potential to enhance food safety by inhibiting foodborne pathogens and extending product shelf life.

TI  == intraoperative vancomycin use in spinal surgery: single institution experience and microbial trends.
AB  == study design: retrospective case series. objective: to demonstrate the microbial  trends of spinal surgical site infections in patients who had previously received crystallized vancomycin in the operative bed. summary of background data: prior large, case control series demonstrate the significant decrease in surgical site  infection with the administration of vancomycin in the wound bed. methods: a single institution, electronic database search was conducted for all patients who underwent spinal surgery who had received prophylactic crystalline vancomycin powder in the wound bed. patients with a prior history of wound infection, intrathecal pumps, or spinal stimulators were excluded. results: a total of 981 consecutive patients (494 males, 487 females; mean age, 59.4 yr; range, 16-95 yr) were identified from january 2011 to june 2013. the average dose of vancomycin powder was 1.13 g (range, 1-6 g). sixty-six patients (6.71%) were diagnosed with  a surgical site infection, of which 51 patients had positive wound cultures (5.2%). of the 51 positive cultures, the most common organism was staphylococcus  aureus. the average dose of vancomycin was 1.3 g in the 38 cases where a gram-positive organism was cultured. a number of gram-negative infections were encountered such as serratia marcescens, enterobacter aerogenes, bacteroides fragilis, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter koseri, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the average dose of vancomycin was 1.2 g in 23 cases where a gram-negative infection was cultured. fifteen of the 51 positive cultures (29.4%) were polymicrobial. eight (53%) of these 15 polymicrobial cultures contained 3 or more distinct organisms. conclusion: prophylactic intraoperative vancomycin use in the wound bed in spinal surgery may increase the incidence of gram-negative or polymicrobial spinal infections. the use of intraoperative vancomycin may correlate with postoperative seromas, due to the high incidence of nonpositive cultures. large, randomized, prospective trials are needed to demonstrate causation and dose-response relationship.

TI  == the presence of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial pathogens in endotracheal tube biofilms and corresponding surveillance cultures.
AB  == mechanically ventilated patients often develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap). soon after intubation, a mixed biofilm harboring microbial pathogens is formed on the endotracheal tube (et). it is believed that this biofilm contributes to the development of vap. unfortunately, the causative agent is often not known at the time vap is suspected, and early therapy often relies on the identification of surveillance cultures (sc). it is thus important to know whether these sc can predict the microbial flora in et biofilms. in this study, we compare the presence of a number of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial bacteria (enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) and of candida albicans in cultures from et biofilms and sc (i.e. sputum samples, nose swabs, and throat swabs) of 20 mechanically ventilated patients. our data indicate that  there is a good correlation between the presence of (antibiotic-resistant) pathogens in et biofilms and sc.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the canward surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 canadian hospitals from january 2010 to december 2012. in total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method (document m07-a9, 2012), with mics interpreted by using clsi breakpoints (document m100-s23, 2013). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (mic90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, c. freundii, and h. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to clsi mic interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (p. mirabilis) to 54.0% (s. marcescens). all isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (mic90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity  against staphylococci or streptococci. all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.03 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and streptococcus agalactiae (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. we conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to  third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing e. coli and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of schinus lentiscifolius (anacardiaceae).
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: schinus lentiscifolius marchand (syn. schinus weinmannifolius engl) is a plant native to rio grande do sul (southern brazil) and has been used in brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. material and methods: the crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, three gram negative bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: candida albicans, candida tropicalis, cryptococcus neoformans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two gram positive bacteria, namely, bacillus cereus, enterococcus spp, and six gram negative bacteria, namely, burkholderia cepacia, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis. results: the leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of schinus lentiscifolius showed a  broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (mic) against the tested bacteria and fungi. the n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against candida albicans (mic=25 mug/ml), candida tropicalis (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and cryptococcus neoformans, (mic=15.5 mug/ml). from the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of schinus lentiscifolius. conclusion: the antimicrobial activity and some constituents of schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. the results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.

TI  == etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bacterial pathogens from urinary tract infection.
AB  == urinary tract infection (uti) is the most common infection in both community and  hospital patients. in majority of the cases, empirical antimicrobial treatment is practiced before the laboratory results of urine culture. thus, antibiotic resistance may increase in urinary bacterial pathogens due to improper use of drugs. this study was designed to find out the etiological agents of uti and their prevalence, and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the bacterial pathogens isolated from urine culture. this study was conducted in  kathmandu model hospital, kathmandu, nepal from april to october, 2009. midstream urine samples from 1323 patients suspected of uti were analyzed by microscopy, and conventional semi-quantitative culture technique for the significant growth.  antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed for the isolates by modified kirby-bauer disk diffusion method. data were analyzed using spss software window  version 16. the overall prevalence of uti was found to be 18.89%. the most frequent causative organisms isolated were escherichia coli (82.30%), enterococcus faecalis (5.60%), citrobacter freundii (3.60%), enterobacter aerogenes (2.40%), coagulase negative staphylococci (2.40%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.20%), proteus mirabilis (0.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.4%), and staphylococcus aureus (0.4%). nitrofurantoin and amoxycillin were found to be the most effective antibiotic against gram negative and gram positive isolates respectively. e. coli was found to be the most common etiological agent of uti and nitrofurantoin was the most effective drug among the isolates.

TI  == a possible role of partially pyrolysed essential oils in australian aboriginal traditional ceremonial and medicinal smoking applications of eremophila longifolia (r. br.) f. muell (scrophulariaceae).
AB  == ethnopharmacological significance: eremophila longifolia is one of the most respected of the traditional medicines used by australian aboriginal people. customary use involves smoldering the leaves over hot embers of a fire to produce an acrid smoke, believed to have therapeutic effects broadly consistent with antimicrobial, antifungal and anti-inflammatory capacity. aim of the study: the current study aims to examine the contribution of partially pyrolysed and non-pyrolysed essential oils in traditional usage of eremophila longifolia. materials and methods: non-pyrolysed and partially pyrolysed essential oils were  produced by hydrodistillation and part-wet/part-dry distillation, respectively. all samples were tested for antimicrobial activity by broth dilution. some of these samples were further treated to an incrementally stepped temperature profile in a novel procedure employing a commercial thermocycler in an attempt to mimic the effect of temperature gradients produced during smoking ceremonies. components from the pyrodistilled oils were compared with the non-pyrodistilled oils, using gc-ms, gc-fid and hplc-pad. the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl method, was used to compare free radical scavenging ability. results: partially pyrolysed oils had approximately three or more times greater antimicrobial activity, enhanced in cultures warmed incrementally to 60 degrees c and held for 30s and further enhanced if held for 2 min. partially pyrolysed oils showed a radical scavenging capacity 30-700 times greater than the corresponding non-pyrolysed oils. hplc-pad revealed the presence of additional constituents not present in the fresh essential oil. conclusion: these results, by showing enhanced antimicrobial and antioxidant activities, provide the first known western scientific justification for the smoking ceremonies involving leaves of eremophila longifolia. during customary use, both partially pyrolysed as well as  non-pyrolysed essential oils may contribute significantly to the overall intended medicinal effect.

TI  == comparative efficacy evaluation of disinfectants routinely used in hospital practice: india.
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare practically achieved disinfection efficacy of some locally available disinfectants on surfaces and infectious microbiological hospital waste. materials and methods: seven disinfectants were tested at concentrations recommended by manufacturers on rough and smooth surfaces that were contaminated experimentally by locally circulating  isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, standard isolate of salmonella typhi and candida  albicans. reduction in microbial counts before and after surface disinfection was expressed as log reduction. a very heavy microbial waste load was simulated by immersing culture plates with heavy microbial growth in disinfectants. daily, a sample of disinfectant was taken and subjected to in-use test. results: the highest average log reduction of test microbes on the rough surface was given by  desnet (5.05) and bacillocid special (5.02). a comparable average log reduction of test microbes on a smooth steel surface was noted (5.68, 5.67, 5.50) for lysol, bacillocid sp. and desnet, respectively. in the discard jars, bacillocid special worked satisfactorily for 4 days, desnet for 3 days and hi-giene germitol for 1 day. the remainder of the disinfectants failed in the in-use test on day 1. phenolics, although widely used in our settings, may not be as good surface disinfectants as newer formulations like desnet and bacillocid special. conclusions: newer quaternary ammonium compounds and aldehyde formulations were found to be the best disinfectants for disinfection of heavy contamination.

TI  == rapid identification of eskape bacterial strains using an autonomous microfluidic device.
AB  == this article describes bacteria id chips ('bacchips'): an inexpensive, portable,  and autonomous microfluidic platform for identifying pathogenic strains of bacteria. bacchips consist of a set of microchambers and channels molded in the elastomeric polymer, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (pdms). each microchamber is preloaded with mono-, di-, or trisaccharides and dried. pressing the layer of pdms into contact with a glass coverslip forms the device; the footprint of the device in this article is approximately 6 cm(2). after assembly, bacchips are degased under large negative pressure and are stored in vacuum-sealed plastic bags. to use the device, the bag is opened, a sample containing bacteria is introduced at the inlet of the device, and the degased pdms draws the sample into the central channel and chambers. after the liquid at the inlet is consumed, air  is drawn into the bacchip via the inlet and provides a physical barrier that separates the liquid samples in adjacent microchambers. a ph indicator is admixed with the samples prior to their loading, enabling the metabolism of the dissolved saccharides in the microchambers to be visualized. importantly, bacchips operate  without external equipment or instruments. by visually detecting the growth of bacteria using ambient light after approximately 4 h, we demonstrate that bacchips with ten microchambers containing different saccharides can reproducibly detect the eskape panel of pathogens, including strains of: enterococcus faecalis, enteroccocus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae. this article describes a bacchip for point-of-care detection of eskape pathogens and a starting point for designing multiplexed assays that identify bacterial strains from clinical samples and simultaneously determine their susceptibility to antibiotics.

AB  == staphylococcus aureus superantigens and bacterial biofilms have been implicated in the development of chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. we conducted a study of 32 lebanese patients-21 males and 11 females, aged 15 to 71 years (mean: 39)-to identify bacteria isolated from nasal polyps and to determine if these bacteria produced superantigens and biofilms. polyps were surgically removed, homogenized, and subjected to bacteriologic studies. the presence or absence of s aureus enterotoxin a, b, c, and d (superantigen) genes was determined in all isolates by polymerase chain reaction. biofilm production by coagulase-negative staphylococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa was assessed by tissue culture plate assay. a total of 34 bacterial species/groups were isolated from the nasal polyps. of these, only 3 (8.8%) were s aureus, and only 1 possessed an enterotoxin-coding gene (enterotoxin b). moreover, of the 21 coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates that were found, none possessed the investigated genes, and only 1 had a strong biofilm-formation property. our results could not confirm that s aureus enterotoxins (superantigens) or biofilm-producing bacteria play a role in the development of nasal polyps in the lebanese group studied.

TI  == bacteriologic and plasmid analysis of etiologic agents of conjunctivitis in lagos, nigeria.
AB  == background: conjunctivitis, an inflammation of the conjunctiva, is one of the most common eye problems affecting all age groups in nigeria. a better understanding of its epidemiology and the antibiotic susceptibility of etiologic  bacterial agents is crucial for the initiation of preventive and therapeutic measures. this study determined the distribution and patterns of bacterial infections in nigerian patients with conjunctivitis. antibiotic resistance patterns and the plasmid profiles of these pathogens were also investigated. methodology: a total of 83 consecutive and non-duplicate conjunctival specimens were collected from patients attending eye clinics at three different hospitals in lagos, nigeria, between february and september 2010. specimens were cultured on standard bacteriologic media and the recovered isolates speciated using standard techniques. susceptibility of pathogens to antibiotics and plasmid dna extraction were carried out by disk diffusion and alkaline lysis methods. conjugation experiment was done with rifampicin-resistant escherichia coli dh5alpha as the recipient cell. data were analyzed using the chi-square test. results: all the specimens were culture-positive, yielding a total of 155 bacterial isolates. gram-positive cocci comprising staphylococcus aureus (27.7%)  and coagulase-negative staphylococcus sp. (22.6%) accounted for 50.3% (78 of 155) of conjunctivitis cases, followed by gram-positive bacilli (22.6%), gram-negative bacilli (21.3%), and gram-negative cocci (4.5%). corynebacterium spp. were the most commonly isolated gram-positive bacilli accounting for 16.1% of conjunctivitis cases. pseudomonas aeruginosa topped with 9.7% as the most commonly isolated gram-negative bacilli. other gram-negative bacilli in order of  their isolations were e. coli (6.5%), proteus sp. (3.2%), klebsiella sp. (1.9%),  and enterobacter aerogenes (1.9%). moraxella spp. were the only gram-negative cocci isolated, and they accounted for 4.5% of the total conjunctival infections. further analysis of the complexity of infections showed that 25 specimens elicited mono-infections, while cases of polymicrobial infections caused by two pathogens and three or more pathogens constituted 51.8% and 18.1% of conjunctivitis specimens screened, respectively. the disparity in the percentage  contribution of three infection patterns was significant (p < 0.05). antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed chloramphenicol and ofloxacin as the least and most active antibiotics tested as 99 (63.9%) and 149 (96.1%) of the 155 recovered isolates were sensitive to them. on the whole, the least susceptible pathogen was p. aeruginosa with sensitivities ranging from 20% to 80%, while moraxella sp. represented the most sensitive pathogen with sensitivities ranging from 71.4% to  100%. other bacterial isolates also elicited antibiotic sensitivities in the range of 33.3-100%. a total of 101 isolates were screened for plasmids, of which  45 harbored plasmids, yielding a plasmid frequency of 44.6%. conjugal transfer of resistance to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and streptomycin was detected in the transconjugants after the mating experiment. the antibiotic resistances were transferred either singly or in combination from six of the seven selected donor  strains. the antibiotic resistance pattern transferred by these donor strains was partial and was associated with the transfer of r plasmids of sizes 21.3, 15.2, and 5.0 kb from three of the six transferable strains. the frequencies of transfer of antibiotype or r plasmids to the transconjugants ranged from 1.8 x 10(-7) to 1.4 x 10(-5) transconjugants per donor strain. conclusion: conjunctivitis as an eye problem in lagos is polymicrobial with infections associated with transferable r plasmids for chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and streptomycin. continuous surveillance of conjunctivitis in relation to etiology,  drug susceptibility, and plasmid transferability in the study area is therefore recommended.

TI  == contemporary revision penile prosthesis surgery is not associated with a high risk of implant colonization or infection: a single-surgeon series.
AB  == introduction: revision penile prosthesis surgery has traditionally been associated with a greater risk of postoperative infection than primary implant placement. this has been attributed to the high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteria found surrounding the implant at the time of revision surgery. aim: to validate whether contemporary revision surgery remains associated with a high risk of asymptomatic colonization and postoperative infection. methods: a comprehensive, prospective database consisting of consecutive patients undergoing primary and revision penile prosthesis surgery at our center was analyzed. main outcome measures: the infection risk in primary and revision implant surgery was  compared. the prevalence of asymptomatic implant colonization during revision surgery, and whether this was associated with clinical infection was evaluated. the spectrum of bacterial species causing infection in this contemporary single-surgeon series was described. results: one hundred seventeen primary and 72 revision implant recipients were studied. infection developed in four (3.4%) patients undergoing primary implants, two (4.3%) patients undergoing removal and  replacement for mechanical malfunction, and three (12%) patients undergoing rerouting for extrusion (p = 0.26). intraoperative cultures were positive in 5 (9.8%) of 51 revision patients, none of whom developed infections. organisms causing infection included staphylococcus aureus and enterobacter aerogenes. unexpectedly, an adjuvant, alcohol-based skin prep in our last 83 patients reduced the infection risk to 1.2%. conclusions: in our series, the infection risk associated with revision of malfunctioning devices was no greater than primary implant placement. rerouting was associated with a higher infection risk, likely due to technical factors, and not implant colonization. less than 10% of our revision implants were colonized, and this had no bearing on the development  of a postoperative infection. s. epidermidis was not the most common organism implicated in device infections. finally, our experience with an adjuvant, alcohol-based skin prep warrants further randomized prospective evaluation.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the canward 2007-2009 study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. all  staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (mic(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/ml and 2 mug/ml, respectively). ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), </=  0.06 mug/ml), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic(90), </= 0.06 mug/ml), staphylococcus epidermidis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml), and enterococcus faecalis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml). over 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/ml. ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and k. pneumoniae. the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus  pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (mic(90), 16 mug/ml). the  broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.

TI  == synergistic interaction of phenylpropanoids with antibiotics against bacteria.
AB  == phenylpropanoids constitute a large part of our daily diet and there is a possibility that they might interact with synthetic drugs. the present work was aimed at studying the interaction of seven phenylpropanoids (cinnamic, p-coumaric, caffeic, chlorogenic, ferulic, 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic and 2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamic acid) with five antibiotics (amikacin, ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and vancomycin) against gram-negative (escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus) bacteria. the interaction studies were performed by chequerboard and time-kill curve assays. both assays revealed that cinnamic, p-coumaric and ferulic acids were the most active. they combined synergistically  with the majority of the antibiotics and exhibited enhanced activity against all  the micro-organisms. the time-kill curve parameters were better (p<0.05) for the  combinations of amikacin with ferulic, cinnamic or p-coumaric acid than for the individual treatments. amikacin was the most favourable antibiotic and s. aureus  was the most sensitive microbe to most of the combinations. these phenylpropanoids damaged the bacterial membrane as assessed by the live/dead baclight kit, and structure-activity relationship studies indicated that hydrophilic groups enhanced this activity.

TI  == identification and characterization of a phospholipase a2 from the venom of the saw-scaled viper: novel bactericidal and membrane damaging activities.
AB  == phospholipase a(2) (pla(2)), a common toxic component of snake venom, has been implicated in various pharmacological effects. in this study, a basic myotoxic pla(2), named ectx-i was isolated from echis carinatus snake venom by using gel filtration on superdex g-75, and reverse phase hplc on c18 and c8 sepharose columns. pla(2), ectx-i was 13,861.72 molecular weight as estimated by maldi-tof  (15 kd by sds-page), and consisted of 121 amino acid residues cross-linked by seven disulfide bonds. the n-terminal sequences revealed significant homology with basic myotoxic pla(2)s from other snake venoms. the purified pla(2) ectx-i was evaluated (250 mug/ml) for bactericidal activity of a wide variety of human pathogens against burkholderia pseudomallei (khw&tes), enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. ectx-i showed strong antibacterial activity against b. pseudomallei (khw) and e. aerogenes among the tested bacteria. other gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria showed only a moderate effect. however,  the gram-positive bacterium e. aerogenes failed to show any effect on ectx-i protein at tested doses. the most significant bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect of ectx-i was observed at mics of >15 mug/ml against (b. pseudomallei, khw) and mics >30 mug/ml against e. aerogenes. mechanisms of bactericidal and membrane damaging effects were proved by ultra-structural analysis. ectx-i was able to induce cytotoxicity on thp-1 cells in vitro as well as lethality in balb/c mice. ectx-i also induced mild myotoxic effects on mouse skin, but was devoid of hemolytic effects on human erythrocytes up to 500 mug/ml. it is shown that the toxic effect induced by e. carinatus venom is due to the presence of myotoxic pla(2) (ectx-i). the result also corroborates the hypothesis of an association between toxic and enzymatic domains. in conclusion, ectx-i displays a heparin binding c-terminal region, which is probably responsible for the cytotoxic and bactericidal effects.

TI  == patterns of antimicrobial therapy in severe nosocomial infections: empiric choices, proportion of appropriate therapy, and adaptation rates--a multicentre,  observational survey in critically ill patients.
AB  == this prospective, observational multicentre (n=24) study investigated relationships between antimicrobial choices and rates of empiric appropriate or adequate therapy, and subsequent adaptation of therapy in 171 icu patients with severe nosocomial infections. appropriate antibiotic therapy was defined as in vitro susceptibility of the causative pathogen and clinical response to the agent administered. in non-microbiologically documented infections, therapy was considered adequate in the case of favourable clinical response <5 days. patients had pneumonia (n=127; 66 ventilator-associated), intra-abdominal infection (n=23), and bloodstream infection (n=21). predominant pathogens were pseudomonas  aeruginosa (n=29) escherichia coli (n=26), staphylococcus aureus (n=22), and enterobacter aerogenes (n=21). in 49.6% of infections multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacteria were involved, mostly extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ebsl)-producing  enterobacteriaceae and mdr non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria. prior antibiotic exposure and hospitalisation in a general ward prior to icu admission  were risk factors for mdr. empiric therapy was appropriate/adequate in 63.7% of cases. empiric schemes were classified according to coverage of (i) esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria ("meropenem-based"), (ii) non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria (schemes with an  antipseudomonal agent), and (iii) first-line agents not covering esbl-enterobacteriaceae nor non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria. meropenem-based schemes allowed for significantly higher rates of appropriate/adequate therapy (p<0.001). this benefit remained when only patients  without risk factors for mdr were considered (p=0.021). in 106 patients (61%) empiric therapy was modified: in 60 cases following initial inappropriate/inadequate therapy, in 46 patients in order to refine empiric therapy. in this study reflecting real-life practice, first-line use of meropenem provided significantly higher rates of the appropriate/adequate therapy, irrespective of presence of risk factors for mdr.

TI  == gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis of volatiles obtained by four different techniques from salvia rosifolia sm., and evaluation for biological activity.
AB  == four different isolation techniques, conventional hydrodistillation (hd), microwave-assisted hydrodistillation (mwhd), microdistillation (md) and micro-steam distillation-solid-phase microextraction (msd-spme), have been used to analyze the volatile constituents from the aerial parts of salvia rosifolia sm. by gas chromatography and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. hd and mwhd techniques produced quantitatively (yield, 0.39% and 0.40%) and qualitatively (aromatic profile) similar essential oils. alpha-pinene (15.7-34.8%), 1,8-cineole (16.6-25.1%), beta-pinene (6.7-13.5%), beta-caryophyllene (1.4-5.0%) and caryophyllene oxide (1.4-4.4%) were identified  as major constituents of this turkish endemic species. besides, the hydrodistilled oil of s. rosifolia was evaluated for antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, antioxidant and cytotoxic activities. the hydrodistilled oil of s. rosifolia showed antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) with a mic value of 125microg/ml. other human pathogenic microorganisms (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus epidermidis, candida albicans)  were also inhibited within a moderate range (mic=125-1000microg/ml). antifungal activity of the oil was also observed against the strawberry anthracnose-causing  fungal plant pathogens colletotrichum acutatum, c. fragariae and c. gloeosporioides. no cytotoxicity was observed for s. rosifolia oil up to 25mg/ml  against malignant melanoma, epidermal, ductal and ovary carcinoma.

TI  == bacteriological evaluation of pre-cut fruits sold in kano metropolis, kano state, nigeria.
AB  == one hundred and fifty (150) pre-cut fruit samples comprising of pineapples (50),  paw-paw (50) and watermelon (50) at the point of stand retail outlets were tested by standard bacteriological methods to determine bacterial contamination of the fruits. out of these 150 examined 136 (90.67%) were contaminated with bacteria. the bacterial distribution were; escherichia coli 69 (46.00%), staphylococcus aureus 29 (19.33%), salmonella species 13 (8.67%), proteus species 18 (12.00%), enterobacter aerogenes 3 (2.00%), klebsiella pneumoniae 2 (1.33%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 (1.33%). among the 50 pineapple pre-cuts, escherichia coli 26 (17.33%), staphylococcus aureus 6 (4.00%), salmonella species 7 (4.67%), proteus  species 9 (6.00%), pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 (1.33%); the 50 watermelon had escherchia coli 22 (14.67%), staphylococcus aureus 13 (8.67%), salmonella species 3 (2.00%), proteus species 5 (3.33%), enterobacter aerogenes 2 (1.33%), klebsiella species 2 (1.33%). of the 50 paw-paw pre-cuts were: escherichia coli 21 (14.00%), staphylococcus aureus 10 (6.67%), salmonella species 3 (2.00%), proteus species 4 (2.67%), enterobacter aerogenes 1 (0.67%) were isolated. the findings in this study have shown that the food vendors failed to adopt adequate  hygiene for food handling and thus, suggest that the quality of all the pre-cut fruits sold at the retail outlets were not bacteriologically satisfactory. the public health risks associated with these pre-cut fruits may suggest that these fruits could serve as the vehicles for foodborne illnesses. this study has shown  the need to educate the vendors on how to protect utensils and fruits to avoid contamination and spoilage.

TI  == significance of infection markers and microbiological findings during tissue processing of cryopreserved arterial homografts for the early postoperative course.
AB  == background: to evaluate homograft implantation for the urgent treatment of vascular infections on the basis of the course of infection using microbiological findings in perioperatively obtained specimens and during homograft processing. patients and methods: 85 patients were treated with cryopreserved homografts from 2004-2007. the microbiological findings of the decontamination process of homografts in the tissue bank were evaluated. the perioperative infection profile (microorganisms, crp, leukocytes, body temperature) of the patients was analysed. results: complete microbiological and clinical follow-up for the postoperative course was available for 35 patients, who were treated with homografts from the same tissue bank and finally included into this study. 55 cryopreserved homografts were implanted. 35/55 (64%) homografts were positive for microorganisms before decontamination. 3/35 (9%) homografts remained positive after the decontamination. 33 patients were operated for prosthetic graft infection and 2 for an infiltration of a large vessel from neighbouring malignant disease. the most common infection agent was staphylococcus aureus. thirty-day mortality was 20% (7/35). only in 4/35 (11%) patients were the microorganisms of  the intraoperative swabs also detected during the postoperative course. the microorganisms were orsa, enterococcus faecium, enterobacter aerogenes and burkholderia cepacia. the patient with orsa infection died on pod 11 from multiple organ failure and all other patients recovered. none of the postoperative swabs showed the homograft predecontamination microorganisms. interestingly, a significant association (p = 0.003) between c-reactive protein increase two weeks after surgery and donor-recipient abo mismatch was found. conclusions: the implantation of homografts following the established decontamination is an alternative urgent therapeutic option in vascular infections with encouraging outcomes. the absence of the predecontamination focus in the postoperative specimens of patients, suggests that the postoperative course and outcomes show no strong relation to potential homograft contamination  prior to the decontamination process.

TI  == biological activity of alkaloids from solanum dulcamara l.
AB  == alkaloids are well known for their antimicrobial activity. though all natural alkaloids come from plants, not all plants produce alkaloids. plants of the solanaceae family are known for their high alkaloid content. alkaloids are found  in all plant parts like roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits and seeds. in the present study, those plant parts of solanum dulcamara were selected which have been reported to produce a high content of a specific alkaloid: solanine (from unripe fruits), solasodine (from flowers) and beta-solamarine (from roots). these alkaloids were extracted from various parts of s. dulcamara by well-established methods and were screened for their antibacterial activity. human pathogenic bacteria, viz., enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus,  were selected for the study. all three alkaloids inhibited the growth of e. coli  and s. aureus. however, no significant activity was observed against e. aerogenes. minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration were also evaluated.

AB  == we investigated the microbiological and toxicological effects of three perla black bean extracts on the growth and culture of selected pathogenic microorganisms, the toxicity over vero cell lines and an in vivo rat model. three different solvents were used to obtain perla black bean extracts. all three perla black bean extracts were tested for antibacterial and antiparasitic activity and  further analysed for intrinsic cytotoxicity (ic(50)). methanol perla black bean extract was used for acute toxicity test in rats, with the up-and-down doping method. all perla black bean extracts inhibited bacterial growth. pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella oxytoca, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and listeria monocytogenes showed inhibition, while escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes did not. acidified water and acetic acid perla black bean extract were tested in parasites. the best ic(50) was observed for giardia lamblia, while higher concentrations were active against entamoeba histolytica and trichomonas vaginalis. the vero cells toxicity levels (ic(50)) for methanol, acidified water  and acetic acid perla black bean extract were [mean +/- s.d. (95% ci)]: 275 +/- 6.2 (267.9-282.0), 390 +/- 4.6 (384.8-395.2) and 209 +/- 3.39 (205.6-212.4) microg/ml, respectively. in vivo acute toxicity assays did not show changes in absolute organ weights, gross and histological examinations of selected tissues or functional tests. the acetic acid and methanol perla black bean extract proved to exhibit strong antibacterial activity and the acidified water perla black bean extract exerted parasiticidal effects against giardia lamblia, entamoeba hystolitica and trichomonas vaginalis. the three perla black bean extracts assayed over vero cells showed very low toxicity and the methanol perla black bean extract in vivo did not cause toxicity.

TI  == efficacy of plant essential oils against foodborne pathogens and spoilage bacteria associated with ready-to-eat vegetables: antimicrobial and sensory screening.
AB  == the objectives of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of plant essential oils (eos) against foodborne pathogens and key spoilage bacteria pertinent to ready-to-eat vegetables and to screen the selected eos for sensory acceptability. the eos basil, caraway, fennel, lemon balm, marjoram, nutmeg, oregano, parsley, rosemary, sage, and thyme were evaluated. the bacteria evaluated were listeria spp., staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus spp., bacillus cereus, salmonella, enterobacter spp., escherichia coli, and pseudomonas spp. quantitative antimicrobial analyses were performed using an absorbance-based microplate assay. efficacy was compared using mic, the half maximum inhibitory concentration, and the increase in lag phase. generally, gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to eos than were gram-negative bacteria, and listeria monocytogenes strains were among the most sensitive. of the spoilage organisms, pseudomonas spp. were the most resistant. oregano and thyme eos had the highest activity against all the tested bacteria. marjoram and basil eos had selectively  high activity against b. cereus, enterobacter aerogenes, e. coli, and salmonella, and lemon balm and sage eos had adequate activity against l. monocytogenes and s. aureus. within bacterial species, eo efficacy was dependent on strain and in some cases the origin of the strain. on a carrot model product, basil, lemon balm, marjoram, oregano, and thyme eos were deemed organoleptically acceptable, but only oregano and marjoram eos were deemed acceptable for lettuce. selected eos may be useful as natural and safe additives for promoting the safety and quality  of ready-to-eat vegetables.

TI  == bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus strains isolated from poto poto, a congolese  fermented maize product, and genetic fingerprinting of their plantaricin operons.
AB  == thirty one bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus isolates were identified among 135 lactobacilli isolated from the congolese fermented maize product poto poto, during the preparation and from the finished product. using species-specific pcr  and 16s rrna gene sequencing, 28 and 3 isolates were identified as l. plantarum and l. fermentum, respectively. cluster analysis of rapd-pcr fingerprints revealed two main groups (g1 and g2) plus the l. fermentum isolate c4-13. group g1 contained 23 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 74.5%, and could be divided in two subgroups (g1-1, g1-2) each with several branches, plus the l. plantarum isolate c11. group g2 contained 8 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 86%, with two main branches. using pcr amplification with specific  primers, several genes of the plantaricin cluster found in l. plantarum c11 were  identified in the isolates. the number of genes that were detected varied between the strains. the l. fermentum isolate ec11 also contained the plndefg genes. pcr  amplification of dna from isolates with primers directed to the upstream and downstream region of the plantaricin cluster generated an amplicon identical to that obtained with dna from the control strain l. plantarum wcfs1. amplification  products from the positive strains were used for restriction analysis with hindiii, ecori and kpni in separate reactions. cluster analysis of restriction profiles revealed high similarities for ecori and hindii digest profiles, and an  identical profile for all kpni digests. the l. fermentum ec11 isolate clustered with l. plantarum strains in a group with a high correlation coefficient. the results suggest a low degree of diversity in the plantarincin gene cluster. however, other strains that tested positive for individual plantaricin genes may  present great heterogeneity in the plantaricin operons. because of their broad spectra of inhibition (including escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, enterobacter aerogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and enterococcus faecalis), isolates from the present study could  be used to improve the safety and storage stability of poto poto.

TI  == the culture site of the gallbladder affects recovery of bacteria in symptomatic cholelithiasis.
AB  == aim: traditional methods for bile culturing may miss a large number of underlying bacterial infections that could lead to acute or chronic cholecystitis. aim: to evaluate possible differences regarding the site of material collection and thus  to detect the most suitable sample site for gallbladder culture. methods: a cohort of 137 patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis was enrolled. after surgical excision of the gallbladder, bile cultures were separately performed from fundus, body and neck. identification of bacteria as well as computation of  mean bacterial concentrations were performed with standard microbiological techniques. wilcoxon's paired and chi-square tests were used for comparison between continuous and discrete parameters, respectively. results: thirty-one patients (22.6%) demonstrated at least one positive culture sample. positivity was 31/31 (100.0%) in neck samples, 20/31 (64.5%) in body and 13/31 (41.9%) in fundus samples (p<0.001). the microorganisms identified were escherichia coli (14 cases) and enterococcus faecalis (10 cases), followed by staphylococcus aureus (3 cases), pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecium, enterobacter aerogenes and  enterobacter cloacae (1 case each). mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the neck (272.2 +/- 187.5) were higher (p<0.01) when compared to those derived from both the body (38.2 +/- 28.7) and the fundus (12.5 +/- 11.3). mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the body were higher (p<0.01) than those derived from the fundus. conclusion: the neck of the gallbladder hosts the biggest bacterial load in comparison with the body and the fundus. this difference might be attributed to the presence of rokitansky-aschoff sinuses, which is the main histological characteristic of the  region.

TI  == [influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial  susceptibility test results by the automated microbial systems].
AB  == the influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test results was evaluated for the three automated microbial systems, walkaway-40 (dade microscan, west sacramento, ca, usa), vitek  2 compact (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) and raisus (nissui pharmaceutical, tokyo). in the evaluation, two different species or two different strains were mixed in serial ratios and adjusted to the inoculum cell suspension for the respective systems, and then tested for the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. for the species-identification, all the three automated systems experienced incorrect identifications others from the species inoculated with higher likelihoods (> 90%), e.g. enterobacter cloacae plus klebsiella pneumoniae resulted in k. ornithinolytica or e. aerogenes with 93% to  97% likelihoods at the mixing ratio 9 to 1. whereas, the mixings extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing and non-producing escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant (mrsa) and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant (vr) and vancomycin-susceptible (vs) enterococcus faecalis, always resulted in correct detection of a small portion of resistant cells. however, minimum ratios of resistant cells for the correct detection varied by the systems, that is, raisus required 70% of mrsa, vitek 2 compact was 8%, and the walkaway-40 was 1%. also, when the cell suspension of vs  e. faecalis spiked with proteus mirabilis was tested, the walkaway-40 reported as being very rare biotype, but both vitek 2 compact and raisus reported as the test inoculum being vr e. faecalis. with these results, it can be concluded that: first, incorrect species-identifications others from the inoculated species easily occur when the inoculum contains different species even at the ratio visibly indiscernible on the primary isolation agar plate. secondly, the automated microbial systems always intend to detect antimicrobial resistant cells in the inoculum rather than to detect major susceptible cells to prevent us from  reporting very major error interpretation.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and synergism of some substituted flavonoids.
AB  == natural and synthetic substituted chalcones, flavones and flavanones were tested  for antibacterial activity. in order to determine synergism, new combinations of  substituted flavonoids against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes were assayed. the results allow us to establish relationships between antimicrobial effect of the compounds and membrane structures of these microorganisms. when flavonoid combinations were employed a stronger effect was found against e. coli than against s. aureus. this fact is due to the existence of porins in the outer membrane of g(-)-bacteria. the compound that acts as enhancer acts by blocking the charges of amino acids in the porins and thus facilitates the passage of the other compound by diffusion into the bacterial cell.

TI  == viper metalloproteinase (agkistrodon halys pallas) with antimicrobial activity against multi-drug resistant human pathogens.
AB  == metalloproteinases are abundant enzymes in crotalidae and viperidae snake venoms. snake venom metalloproteinases (svmps) comprise a family of zinc-dependent enzymes, which display many different biological activities. a 23.1 kda protein was isolated from agkistrodon halys (pallas, chinese viper) snake venom. the toxin is a single chain polypeptide with a molecular weight of 23146.61 and an n-terminal sequence (miqvllvticlavfpyqgssiiles) relatively similar to that of other metalloprotein-like proteases isolated from the snake venoms of the viperidae family. the antibacterial effect of agkistrodon halys metalloproteinase (ahm) on burkholderia pseudomallei (strains tes and khw), escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa (gram-negative bacteria) and staphylococcus aureus (gram-positive bacterium) was studied at a concentration 120 microm. interestingly, we found that the metalloproteinase exhibited antibacterial properties and was more active against s. aureus, p. vulgaris, p. mirabilis and multi-drug resistant b. pseudomallei (strain khw) bacteria. ahm variants with high bacteriostatic activity (mic 1.875-60 microm) also tended to be less cytotoxic against u-937 human monocytic cells up to 1 mm concentrations. these results suggest that this  metalloprotein exerts its antimicrobial effect by altering membrane packing and inhibiting mechanosensitive targets.

TI  == succession of dominant and antagonistic lactic acid bacteria in fermented cucumber: insights from a pcr-based approach.
AB  == the goal of the investigation was to study the succession of major groups of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and their antagonism in salt-fermented cucumber using  pcr. in a direct detection method as well as a short enrichment process, pcr enabled detection of leuconostoc and lactobacillus during early hours of fermentation. subsequently, lactobacillus and pediococcus emerged as the dominant genera. nucleic acid sequence of culture-independent clones confirmed the detection of pediococcus as a dominant genera emerging during late stages of fermentation. pcr also revealed time-dependent emergence of mesentericin, pediocin and plantaricin a producers and accounted for the lab succession in the  fermenting samples. a total of 328 lab isolates were obtained collectively from 30 cucumber samples, of which pcr could identify an overwhelming 186 lactobacillus isolates followed by 113 pediococcus and 29 leuconostoc isolates, respectively. based on antimicrobial assay against target strain leuconostoc mesenteroides nrrl b640, 28% of the lab were bacteriocin producers, of which pediocin producers were substantial, followed by plantaricin a and mesentericin producers. the bacteriocins elaborated by the isolates were active against a large number of gram-positive target lab strains and pathogenic bacteria including bacillus cereus, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == microbiological profile of neonatal septicemia in a pediatric care hospital in delhi.
AB  == septicemia continues to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the neonatal units and periodic review of cases to assess any changing trends in the  infecting organisms and their antimicrobial susceptibility is important. over a period of one year (july 2000 to june 2001), 632 samples of blood cultures were submitted to the bacteriology laboratory microbiology, lady hardinge medical college. these samples were investigated for microbial etiology and the isolates  obtained were tested for their susceptibility to the commonly used antibiotics. twenty per cent (125) cases were culture positive. gram-negative bacteria were the predominant isolates (62%), commonest being klebsiella pneumoniae (34%) followed by e. coli (17%), acinetobacter spp. (9%) and enterobacter aerogenes (2%). gram-positive cocci were isolated in 20% cases, of which coagulase negative staphylococcus was the predominant isolate (11%) followed by enterococcus spp. (5%) and s. aureus (4%). candida spp. was isolated from 18% of cases. resistance  to commonly used antibiotics was seen in more than 35% of isolates. an alarming observation was the very high incidence of resistance to amoxycillin+clavulanic acid and ceftriaxone (>80%). all isolates showed highest susceptibility to ciprofloxacin.

TI  == antimicrobial disinfection effect of a laundering procedure for hospital textiles against various indicator bacteria and fungi using different substrates for simulating human excrements.
AB  == recent studies confirm the increase of nosocomial infections and microbial resistance. one of the possible causes is infected textiles due to inappropriate  laundering procedures. most slovenian laundries use thermal laundering procedures with high energy and water consumption to disinfect hospital textiles. in addition to this fact, there is an increasing number of hospital textiles composed of cotton/polyester blends that cannot endure high temperatures of thermal disinfection. on the other hand, decreasing the temperature of laundering procedures enhances the possibility of pathogenic microorganisms to survive the laundering procedure. in our research, we determined the antimicrobic laundering  effect by simulating a common laundering procedure for hospital textiles in the laboratory washing machine at different temperatures by the use of bioindicators. enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, mycobacterium terrae, enterobacter aerogenes, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were used for determining the antibacterial laundering effect. candida albicans was used for determining the antifungal laundering effect. swine blood, artificial sweat, and swine fat were used as substrates for simulating human excrements and were inoculated together with the  chosen microorganisms onto cotton pieces to simulate real laundering conditions.  it was found that e. faecium, s. aureus, e. aerogenes, and p. aeruginosa survived at 60 degrees c, but no microorganisms were found at 75 degrees c.

TI  == evaluation of the hygienic quality and associated public health hazards of raw milk marketed by smallholder dairy producers in the dar es salaam region, tanzania.
AB  == a cross-sectional study was conducted to determine three parameters of the quality of the raw milk marketed by milk selling points (msps) in dar es salaam region. total bacterial count (tbc) was used as an indicator of the microbial quality of the milk; antimicrobial residues were determined; and the california mastitis test (cmt) was used to screen for milk somatic cells as an indication of the mastitis level in the cows that provided the milk. moreover, a water sample at each msp was taken for bacteriological culturing. finally, a questionnaire survey was conducted with the milk sellers at the msps to identify risk factors for poor milk hygiene. a total of 128 milk samples and corresponding water samples were collected from randomly selected milk selling points in dar es salaam region. the mean tbc was (8.2 +/- 1.9) x 10(6) cfu/ml, and major bacterial isolates from the milk samples were escherichia coli (6.3%), bacillus cereus (6.3%), staphylococcus aureus (6.3%) and streptococcus agalactiae (6.3%), enterobacter aerogenes (5.6%) and enterococcus faecalis (4.7%). in most cases, the organisms identified in milk corresponded to those isolated from the corresponding water samples. of milk samples, 79.0% were positive to the cmt and  7.0% were positive for antimicrobial residues. tbc was normalized by log-transformation, and the possible predictors of tbc were identified by fitting two linear regression models. in a random effect model, water microbial quality,  frequency of cleaning the milk containers, frequency of milk supply, milk storage time and the type of containers, and mixing of fresh and previous milk were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with the mean log tbc. in a fixed effect model, in addition to these indicators, water shortage, water source and the refrigerator condition were significantly (p < or = 0.01) associated with log tbc. it was concluded that the milk sold in dar es salaam region is of poor quality and is of public health significance.

TI  == intracellular accumulation of linezolid in escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii and enterobacter aerogenes: role of enhanced efflux pump activity and inactivation.
AB  == objectives: the oxazolidinone class of antibiotics such as linezolid have a narrow spectrum of activity that targets gram-positive bacteria. we hypothesized  that the poor activity of linezolid in gram-negative bacteria is in part caused by relatively low intracellular concentration due to efflux. methods: using whole cell accumulation assays we estimated the intracellular concentration of linezolid in escherichia coli and other enterobacteriaceae. we included test strains with enhanced rnd-type multidrug efflux pump activity and with genetic inactivation of the pump or functional inhibition by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone as inhibitor of the proton motive force or 1-(1-naphthylmethyl)-piperazine (nmp), an efflux pump inhibitor. results: consistent with susceptibility studies, enhanced pump activity caused decreased accumulation, and pump inactivation and inhibition caused increased accumulation, of linezolid. the accumulation levels in test strains of e. coli, citrobacter freundii and enterobacter aerogenes with functional pumps were lower than in control strains of staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium, but were higher after pump inactivation and correlated with ethidium bromide and pyronin y accumulation. conclusions: the intracellular concentration of linezolid is comparatively low owing to efficient efflux of the drug and could be increased substantially by inhibition of rnd-type efflux pumps.

TI  == ft-ir microspectroscopy for early identification of some clinically relevant pathogens.
AB  == aims: to investigate the potentials and limitations of fourier transform-infrared (ft-ir) microspectroscopy as a tool to identify, at the level of microcolonies, pathogenic bacteria frequently isolated in the clinical environment. methods and  results: a total of 1570 ft-ir spectra from 164 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients were recorded from 6 to 10-h old microcolonies of 50-150 microm size. a classification of 100% was obtained for the most frequent gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium at the species level. an average accuracy of about 80% was reached with gram negative bacteria from the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonaceae families; enterobacter aerogenes,  enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella spp., and citrobacter koseri; and proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. results were comparable with ft-ir measurements on dried suspensions from 18-h cultures. conclusions: early identification of young microcolonies is feasible with ft-ir microscopy with a very high accuracy for gram-positive bacteria. some improvement in the transfer of microcolonies is  necessary to increase the accuracy for gram-negative bacteria. significance and impact of the study: combination of ft-ir microscopy and multivariate data analysis could be a complementary, rapid, and reliable tool for screening and discriminating, at species and subspecies level, micro-organisms of clinical, food-borne, or environmental origins.

TI  == 1h nmr spectroscopy in the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae-induced urinary tract infection.
AB  == the (1)h nmr spectroscopic method is suggested and its utility is demonstrated for the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae) in urinary tract infection (uti). k. pneumoniae have the specific property of metabolizing glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-pd), acetate, ethanol and succinate. the quantity of 1,3-pd produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. other common bacteria causing uti (except for citrobacter frundii), such as escherichia coli (e. coli), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), enterobacter  aerogenes, acinetobacter baumanii, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus gp b and staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize glycerol under similar conditions. citrobacter frundii (c. frundii) also gives the same nmr results but is easily differentiated as being motile on direct microscopic examination of urine and it is not common nosocomial infectious agent in urinary  tract infection. the method provides a single-step documentation of k. pneumoniae (and c. frundii) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. out of the total 614 subjects considered, clinical diagnosis of uti was obtained in 516 cases (84%). the nmr-based screening had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 100% and a false negativity of 10% relative to the conventional quantitative culture method. in the present authors' experience, the results of nmr spectroscopy based screening show a very good correlation with the diagnosis of urinary tract infected patients.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of cinnamon oil and cinnamaldehyde from the chinese medicinal herb cinnamomum cassia blume.
AB  == both cinnamomum verum j.s. presl. and cinnamomum cassia blume are collectively called cortex cinnamonmi for their medicinal cinnamon bark. cinnamomum verum is more popular elsewhere in the world, whereas c. cassia is a well known traditional chinese medicine. an analysis of hydro-distilled chinese cinnamon oil and pure cinnamaldehyde by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry revealed that cinnamaldehyde is the major component comprising 85% in the essential oil and the purity of cinnamaldehyde in use is high (> 98%). both oil and pure cinnamaldehyde of c. cassia were equally effective in inhibiting the growth of various isolates  of bacteria including gram-positive (1 isolate, staphylococcus aureus), and gram-negative (7 isolates, e. coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus and samonella typhymurium), and fungi including yeasts (four species of candida, c. albicans, c. tropicalis, c. glabrata, and c. krusei), filamentous molds (4 isolates, three  aspergillus spp. and one fusarium sp.) and dermatophytes (three isolates, microsporum gypseum, trichophyton rubrum and t. mentagraphytes). their minimum inhibition concentrations (mic) as determined by agar dilution method varied only slightly. the mics of both oil and cinnamaldehyde for bacteria ranged from 75 microg/ml to 600 microg/ml, for yeasts from 100 microg/ml to 450 microg/ml, for filamentous fungi from 75 microg/ml to 150 microg/ml, and for dermatophytes from  18.8 microg/ml to 37.5 microg/ml. the antimicrobial effectiveness of c. cassia oil and its major constituent is comparable and almost equivalent, which suggests that the broad-spectrum antibiotic activities of c. cassia oil are due to cinnamaldehyde. the relationship between structure and function of the main components of cinnamon oil is also discussed.

AB  == a lectin isolated from the red alga solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). the lectin (500 microg/ml) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus sp, and pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/ml but the lectin (10-1000 microg/ml) had no effect on  the growth of the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and b. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. the purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. it is possible that the interaction of s. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium b. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml. the stimulation of the growth of b.  cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/ml), its hapten. thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. the present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.

TI  == bacterial species specificity in prou osmoinducibility and nptii and lacz expression.
AB  == reporter gene-based transcriptional fusions are increasingly being used to address questions in microbial ecology, with constitutively expressed fusions enabling microbe tracking and inducible fusions reporting the presence of environmental signals. to more readily apply this technology to a variety of bacterial species, we examined species specificity in the expression of three promoters of interest. a comparison of two potentially constitutive promoters, each fused to the reporter gene gfp, showed that the nptii promoter (p(nptii)) was expressed in a broader range of species (100% of 11 tested) than the lacz promoter (p(lacz)) (75% of 11 tested), and thus has broader applicability for marking bacteria than p(lacz). for the species that expressed p(lacz), however,p(lacz) was expressed 3-fold more than p(nptii), on average. the escherichia coli prou promoter, which is induced by low water potential in e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, pantoea agglomerans, and pseudomonas syringae, was  shown to be similarly responsive to water potential in strains of clavibacter michiganensis, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, and sinorhizobium meliloti, as well as mildly osmoresponsive in agrobacterium tumefaciens, supporting its broad use as a reporter of water potential. surprisingly, this promoter was not regulated by water potential in strains of staphylococcus aureus and erwinia amylovora, illustrating heretofore unrecognized species specificity in prou inducibility, as well as potential limitations in the species that can serve as bioreporters of water potential.

TI  == chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of four different anatolian propolis samples.
AB  == propolis means a gum that is gathered by bees from various plants. it is known for its biological properties, having antibacterial, antifungal and healing properties. the aims of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of four different anatolian propolis samples on different groups of microorganisms including some oral pathogens and comparison between their chemical compositions. ethanol extracts of propolis (eep) were prepared from four different anatolian propolis samples and examined whether eep inhibit the growth of the test microorganisms or not. for the antimicrobial activity assays, minimum inhibitory  concentrations (mic) were determined by using macrodilution method. the mic values of the most effective propolis (tb) were 2 microg/ml for streptococcus sobrinus and enterococcus faecalis, 4 microg/ml for micrococcus luteus, candida albicans and c. krusei, 8 microg/ml for streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterobacter aerogenes, 16 microg/ml for escherichia coli and c. tropicalis and 32 microg/ml for salmonella typhimurium and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the chemical compositions of eep's were determined by high-temperature high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. the main compounds of four anatolian propolis samples were flavonoids such as pinocembrin, pinostropin, isalpinin, pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine and chrysin. although propolis samples were collected from different regions of anatolia all showed significant antimicrobial activity against the gram positive bacteria and yeasts. propolis can prevent dental caries since it demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms such as streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus and c. albicans, which involves in oral diseases.

TI  == (1)h nmr spectroscopy in the diagnosis of pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced urinary  tract infection.
AB  == the utility of (1)h nmr spectroscopy is suggested and demonstrated for the diagnosis of pseudomonas aeruginosa in urinary tract infection (uti). the specific property of p. aeruginosa of metabolizing nicotinic acid to 6-hydroxynicotinic acid (6-ohna) is exploited. the quantity of 6-ohna produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. other common bacteria causing uti such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, enterobacter aerogenes, acinetobacter baumanii, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter frundii, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus gp b and staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize nicotinic acid under similar conditions. the method provides a single-step documentation of p. aeruginosa qualitatively as well as quantitatively. the nmr method is demonstrated on urine samples from 30 patients with uti caused by p. aeruginosa.

TI  == antibacterial activity and specificity of the six human {alpha}-defensins.
AB  == we developed a kinetic, 96-well turbidimetric procedure that is capable of testing the antimicrobial properties of six human alpha-defensins concurrently on a single microplate. the defensins were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis and tested against gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus) and gram-negative bacteria (enterobacter aerogenes and escherichia coli). analysis of the growth curves provided virtual lethal doses (vlds) equivalent to  conventional 50% lethal doses (ld(50)s), ld(90)s, ld(99)s, and ld(99.9)s obtained from colony counts. on the basis of their respective vld(90)s and vld(99)s, the relative potencies of human myeloid alpha-defensins against s. aureus were hnp2 > hnp1 > hnp3 > hnp4. in contrast, their relative potencies against e. coli and e.  aerogenes were hnp4 > hnp2 > hnp1 = hnp3. hd5 was as effective as hnp2 against s. aureus and as effective as hnp4 against the gram-negative bacteria in our panel.  hd6 showed little or no activity against any of the bacteria in our panel, including b. cereus, which was highly susceptible to the other five alpha-defensins. the assay described provides a quantitative, precise, and economical way to study the antimicrobial activities of host-defense peptides. its use has clarified the relative potencies of human alpha-defensins and raised  intriguing questions about the in vivo function(s) of hd6.

TI  == [investigation of pathogenic bacteria for pulmonary infections and their drug resistance in neurological intensive care unit].
AB  == objective: to investigate the pathogenic bacterial spectrum responsible for pulmonary infections and their drug resistance in patients admitted to neurological care unit. methods: sputum specimens were obtained from patients who developed pulmonary infections in neurological intensive care unit between january, 2001 and june, 2002 for bacterial culture and isolation. k-b paper disc  method was employed for determination of the drug sensitivity of the bacterial isolates. results: in the 207 strains obtained from the patients, the majority (68.51%) were gram-negative and 30.91/ gram-positive bacteria, with fungi detected in one case (0.48%). the major pathogenic bacteria for pulmonary infection were, in the order of frequency, staphylococcus aureus(14.49%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.49%), klebsiella pneumoniae (8.7%), enterobacter cloacae (6.76%), and enterobacter aerogenes (6.28%). drug sensitivity tests showed increased drug resistance of the bacteria, but staphylococcus aureus still remained sensitive to vancomycin and most of the gram-negative bacillus sensitive to imipenem. conclusion: the major pathogenic bacteria causing pulmonary infections in neurological intensive care unit are staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and their drug resistance is obviously increased, suggesting the necessity of strengthening bacterial surveillance and more adequate clinical use of antibiotics.

TI  == synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some netropsin analogues.
AB  == nine novel lexitropsins were synthesized by linking two netropsin-like moieties through three different dicarboxylic acids; 9,10-dihydro-2,7-phenanthrenedicarboxylic acid; [(3-[[(carboxymethyl)amino]carbonyl]benzoyl)amino]acetic acid and indole-2,5-dicarboxylic acid. the netropsin residues were modified by the use of  n-isopentylpyrrole, 5-methylthiophene or 5-isopropylthiazole heterocyclic building blocks in place of the usual n-methylpyrrole. the compounds were tested  against five gram-positive bacteria: staphylococcus aureus, streptomyces faecalis, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, mycobacterium fortuitum, three gram-negative bacteria: klebsiella aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, escherichia coli and three fungi: aspergillus niger, candida albicans and aspergillus nidulans. some of the compounds showed significant inhibitory effects on the growth of the microorganisms.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16srdna oligonucleotide array].
AB  == objective: the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. however conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological  assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. on the basis of special gene sequence, pcr provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. but it is  difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic  agents. oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of  target genes. the objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the pcr product of 16srdna using a pair of universal  primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. methods: by comparison and analysis of the 16srdna sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. a pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight  species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. the probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of pcr  using the universal primers. results: the universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, neisseria meningitides, citrobacter freundii, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human dna as control. the results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could  not hybridize with other bacteria. the lowest concentration of dna (product of pcr) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. the results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. the results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. from the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common  infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. conclusions: despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system,  which contains amplification of the segment of 16rdna from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of pcr products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == evaluation of the hyplex bloodscreen multiplex pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  == we evaluated the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) system (bag, lich, germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification  of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive bactec 9240 blood culture bottles. the test involves amplification of the bacterial dna by multiplex pcr and subsequent hybridization  of the pcr product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an elisa-based format. the available probes allow the separate detection of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal meca  gene. the hyplex bloodscreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (s. aureus, 100%; s. epidermidis, 97.2%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). the specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (escherichia coli, 92.5%; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; klebsiella spp., 100%; enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; s. aureus, 100%, s. epidermidis, 97.7%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus  faecium, 99.6%; streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). the result of the meca gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of staphylococcus aureus investigated. in conclusion, the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-elisa system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the meca gene of staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.

TI  == evaluation of the uro-quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

AB  == background: hygienic hand disinfection using alcohol-based handrubs (ahrs) is an  alternative method to conventional handwashing in hospital wards. because a documented choice of such products would consider data from in-care evaluation, we designed a comparative study of 9 ahrs both in vitro and in vivo in actual care conditions. methods: the bactericidal activity of ahrs was first measured in vitro against 4 hospital strains exhibiting multiple antibiotic resistance: acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter aerogenes. in a second time, ahrs were tested in an intensive care unit for antibacterial activity against the cutaneous flora of personnel hands and for acceptance by the care personnel. results: the 9 ahrs could be classified in 3 groups on the basis of their in vitro activity: products of the first group  showed a bactericidal activity higher than 4 log(10) against the 4 strains. only  1 of these products presented simultaneously an effective antibacterial activity  against the cutaneous flora of care personnel hands and a good acceptance by the  care personnel. conclusion: the in vitro study allowed the differentiation of the ahrs tested on the basis of bactericidal activity, but evaluation in an in-care situation allowed further discrimination through both antibacterial activity and  acceptance. thus, the combination of in vitro and in vivo evaluations should provide helpful arguments in the choice of ahrs.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  == the ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. these pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. these infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer  generations of antibiotics. in this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis  and endophthalmitis. the ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis. mic90 values for the drugs  against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/ml to 0.57 mg/ml and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. the mic90 for gatifloxacin against streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/ml compared with 0.73 mg/ml for moxifloxacin (p = .011). among the gram-negative isolates, the mean mic90 for gatifloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/ml compared with 2.60 mg/ ml for moxifloxacin (p = .023).  mic90 values for gatifloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. for the atypicals, the mic90 values for gatifloxacin against nocardia asteroides and mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.

TI  == are infections due to resistant pathogens associated with a worse outcome in critically ill patients?
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the outcome of critically ill patients infected with antimicrobial resistant microorganisms, and to analyse the factors involved in the development of antimicrobial resistance. methods: all patients admitted to a  31-bed mixed medico-surgical intensive care unit who developed a nosocomial infection were prospectively followed until discharge or death. results: of 949 consecutive patients admitted, 186 developed a nosocomial infection: 79 with an antimicrobial-resistant pathogen and 107 with susceptible strains. the lungs were the main source of infections in both groups. the main resistant microorganisms were enterobacter aerogenes, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa),  and enterobacter cloacae. the main susceptible microorganisms were enterobacter spp., methicillin susceptible s. aureus (mssa), and proteus mirabilis. patients infected with resistant strains had a longer length of stay prior to infection (9+/-4 vs. 5+/-3 days), longer total length of stay (18+/-16 vs. 11+/-7 days), longer duration of mechanical ventilation (12+/-15 vs. 6+/-7 days), and more severe coagulation, liver, and renal dysfunction (all p<0.05). the maximum degrees of organ failure during the icu stay, and the respiratory dysfunction, but not infection with a resistant pathogen, were independent predictors for death. multivariate logistic regression revealed previous use of multiple antibiotics, duration of length of stay prior to infection, and the degree of liver failure as independent factors for development of infection with resistant  organisms. conclusions: infection with antimicrobial resistant microorganisms is  not an independent predictor for death. the development of antimicrobial resistance is related to the previous use of multiple antibiotics, the icu length of stay, and the severity of hepatic dysfunction.

AB  == asymptomatic prostatitis is classified as category iv in nih classification of prostatitis syndrome (1999). no report concerning this category has been present. we investigated this category histopathologically and clinically, in order to clarify the histopathological distribution and its correlation to the clinical features, in this study. among 785 patients who were suspected prostate cancer because of their high prostatic specific antigen (psa) values and to have a sextant prostate needle biopsy was performed between january, 1996 and december,  2000, 88 patients (11.2%) were diagnosed as nih category iv prostatitis (asymptomatic prostatitis). we observed all pathological specimens stained with hematoxylin-eosine, and classified them into subtypes according to the classification criteria for prostatitis defined by true et al. (1999). we also investigated the relationship between histopathological distribution and clinical features such as psa values, psa density, the incidence of pyuria or bacteriuria. in the histopathological study, grade distributions were 12.5% (11/88) in mild, 71.6% (63/88) in moderate, and 15.9% (14/88) in severe. location distributions were 2.3% (2/88) in glandular, 68.2% (60/88) in periglandular, and 29.5% (26/88)  in stromal. no relationship between these subtypes and clinical features was recognized statistically. however, 7 patients (7.95%) were diagnosed as prostate  cancers, later. pyuria was found in 29.1% (23/79). bacteriuria was present in 14.3% (11/77). isolated bacteria were 4 strains of enterococcus faccalis, 2 strains of each of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, and one strain of each of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. gram positive rod, and candida sp. no relationship between these subtypes and bacterial species was recognized. these results indicated that the incidence of niii category iv prostatits was not low without correlation to any clinical features. however, we should pay attention to the presence of prostate cancer, because a small number of the patients were diagnosed as prostate cancer, later.

TI  == persistent silver disinfectant for the environmental control of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: contaminated surfaces can act as a reservoir for pathogenic microorganisms and potentially exacerbate the risk of infection. surface disinfection and decontamination provide temporary amelioration against bacterial colonization. disinfected surfaces eventually become contaminated, thus, mitigating the benefit of the initial disinfection. it is hypothesized that to improve on the current state of the art, a disinfectant should not only immediately disinfect a surface but also provide persistent antimicrobial action  after the product has been applied. we describe here a silver-based disinfectant  technology designed to provide long-lasting sanitization and disinfection to treated surfaces as evaluated on hard surfaces after repeated environmental insults. methods: a comparative evaluation of 6 disinfectant formulations for residual antimicrobial activity after water rinsing was performed. log reduction  of bacterial populations on disinfectant-treated substrates were measured after 30 minutes to 8 hours of exposure and compared with an untreated control. in a similar study, the residual antimicrobial activity of a silver disinfectant was evaluated against antibiotic- and biocide-resistant bacteria also after water rinsing. further, residual antimicrobial activity of the silver disinfectant was  measured after 5 cycles of rinsing, abrasion, and contamination against representative household and nosocomial pathogens (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecium, or salmonella choleraesuis) after 10-minute exposure times. results: in the comparative assay, only the silver disinfectant and a persistent  quaternary ammonium compound disinfectant demonstrated significant residual activity (> or =3.0 log(10) reduction to control) against s aureus whereas only the silver disinfectant demonstrated activity against pseudomonas. no residual activity (< or = 0.5 log reduction to untreated control) was observed for the other disinfectant products. the silver-based disinfectant also showed significant and equivalent efficacy against antibiotic- and silver-resistant bacteria. in addition, the silver disinfectant was able to achieve significant residual activity in 10 minutes against all organisms tested after 1, 3, and 5 cycles of water rinse, abrasion, and microbial contamination. conclusions: the findings show the ability of a new silver-based disinfectant to reduce bacterial  populations that contact treated surfaces within minutes, highlight the potential to interrupt cross-contamination from environmental surfaces, and reduce the risk of infection within the home and health care settings.

TI  == biosynthesis of pyridoxine in saccharomyces cerevisiae--origin of the pyridoxine  nitrogen atom differs under anaerobic and aerobic conditions.
AB  == the amide nitrogen atom of glutamine is incorporated into pyridoxine in four eukaryotes (i.e., emericella nidulans, mucor racemosus, neurospora crassa and saccharomyces cerevisiae) and two prokaryotes (i.e., staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis). however, in the prokaryotes pseudomonas putida, enterobacter  aerogenes and escherichia coli, it is the nitrogen atom of glutamate that is incorporated into pyridoxine (j nutr sci vitaminol (2000) 46, 55-57). as these results were from experiments conducted under aerobic conditions, we investigated the biosynthesis of pyridoxine on s. cerevisiae under anaerobic conditions. the results showed that [amide-15n]l-glutamine was not incorporated into pyridoxine,  unlike the results for aerobic conditions. the incorporation of [15n]ammonium salts into pyridoxine was not inhibited in the presence of casamino acids and tryptophan. the results showed that the nitrogen atoms of amino acids are not used for the biosynthesis of pyridoxine. the incorporation of 15n into pyridoxine was inhibited in the presence of adenine, but not in that of hypoxanthine. thus,  the nitrogen atom of pyridoxine may be from the amino group attached to the c-6 of adenine.

AB  == the synthesis of six 3-aryl-5-(n-propyl)-4,5dihydro-1,2,4-oxadiazoles 3a-f has been achieved in a facile manner by the reaction of an appropriate arylamidoxime  1a-f with butyraldehyde 2. oxidation of 3a-f individually using mno(2) in ch(2)cl(2) or sodium hypochlorite in thf/h(2)o furnished 1,2,4-oxadiazoles 4a-f in good to excellent yields. compounds 4a-f were also evaluated against inflammation. except 4e, all of them reduced inflammation, however, 4c presented  better antiinflammatory activity. a preliminary antimicrobial activity tests of 3a-f showed that these compounds possess activity against some microorganisms. in fact, 3c and 3f have been found to be more effective against staphylococcus aureus, mycobacterium smegmatis, and candida albicans.

TI  == the comparative effect of novel pelargonium essential oils and their corresponding hydrosols as antimicrobial agents in a model food system.
AB  == essential oils and their corresponding hydrosols, obtained after distillation of  various scented pelargonium (geraniaceae) leaves were assessed for their antimicrobial activity in a model food system. both the essential oils and hydrosols were used at 1000 ppm in broccoli soup, previously inoculated with enterobacter aerogenes (at 10(5) cfu g(-1)) and staphylococcus aureus (at 10(4) cfu g(-1)). the results showed a complete inhibition of s. aureus in the broccoli soup by the essential oils of 'sweet mimosa', 'mabel grey', p. graveolens, 'atomic snowflake', 'royal oak', 'attar of roses' and a lesser effect by 'chocolate peppermint' and 'clorinda'; the hydrosols, however, had a potentiating effect on the bacterial population in the food. both extracts showed a complete inhibition of s. aureus in the maximum recovery diluent (mrd). antibacterial activity against e. aerogenes in the broccoli soup was generally very much reduced: only the essential oil of 'mabel grey' showed complete inhibition and virtually no reductions in colonies were seen with the other essential oils; the  hydrosols again caused an increase in bacterial colonies. all the essential oils, bar chocolate peppermint showed complete inhibition of e. aerogenes in mrd, but the hydrosols showed no effect. the results strongly suggest that the residual hydrosols from distillation of these plant essential oils have no potential as antibacterial agents in foods, in contrast to most of the essential oils, which show potential against some micro-organisms, but only in some food systems. the problem of food component interference and its possible management is discussed.

TI  == surveillance of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esble) in northern france: a five-year multicentre incidence study.
AB  == in order to measure the incidence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  (mrsa) and of enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esble), and to evaluate the impact of the national guidelines for multidrug-resistant bacteria (mdrb) prevention in hospitals of northern france, a multicentre study was conducted for three months every year starting in 1996, in  volunteer hospital laboratories. all clinical specimens positive for mrsa and esble were prospectively surveyed. during the five-year surveillance period, the  overall proportion of mrsa was 38.4% in the 28,534 strains of s. aureus, and that of esble was 11.4% in the 6121 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and 47.7% in the  2353 strains of enterobacter aerogenes. the overall incidence rates of clinical specimens positive for mrsa, esbl-k. pneumoniae and e. aerogenes were 0.84. 0.05  and 0.12/1000 hospital-days (hd), respectively. in the 23 hospitals that participated in the survey every year, the proportion and incidence of esble decreased. hence, despite recommendations as for isolation precautions, mrsa remains poorly controlled and requires more effective measures.

TI  == effectiveness of electrolyzed water as a sanitizer for treating different surfaces.
AB  == the effectiveness of electrolyzed (eo) water at killing enterobacter aerogenes and staphylococcus aureus in pure culture was evaluated. one milliliter (approximately 10(9) cfu/ml) of each bacterium was subjected to 9 ml of eo water  or control water (eo water containing 10% neutralizing buffer) at room temperature for 30 s. inactivation (reduction of > 9 log10 cfu/ ml) of both pathogens occurred within 30 s after exposure to eo water containing approximately 25 or 50 mg of residual chlorine per liter. the effectiveness of eo water in reducing e. aerogenes and s. aureus on different surfaces (glass, stainless steel, glazed ceramic tile, unglazed ceramic tile, and vitreous china)  was also evaluated. after immersion of the tested surfaces in eo water for 5 min  without agitation, populations of e. aerogenes and s. aureus were reduced by 2.2  to 2.4 log10 cfu/ cm2 and by 1.7 to 1.9 log10 cfu/cm2, respectively, whereas washing with control water resulted in a reduction of only 0.1 to 0.3 log10 cfu/cm2. the washing of tested surfaces in eo water with agitation (50 rpm) reduced populations of viable cells on the tested surfaces to < 1 cfu/cm2. for the control water treatment with agitation, the surviving numbers of both strains on the tested surfaces were approximately 3 log10 cfu/cm2. no viable cells of either strain were observed in the eo water after treatment, regardless of agitation. however, large populations of both pathogens were recovered from control wash solution after treatment.

TI  == nb2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  == enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ecta) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. we present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ecta compounds, nb2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of nb2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) nb2001 is a substrate for tem-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/k(m)) of greater than 77,000 m-1 s-1. (ii) triclosan is detected in nb2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli but not in e. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) nb2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing e. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. nb2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae. nb2001 is also active against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae.  the results indicate that nb2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent  and demonstrate the potential of ecta in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory isolates of enterobacteriaceae and staphylococcus aureus in italy: incidence and trends over the period 1997-1999.
AB  == the antibiotic susceptibility of members of the family enterobacteriaceae and of  staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from the respiratory tract was assessed over the period 1997-1999 as part of the italian epidemiological observatory survey sponsored by the smith-kline foundation. a standardised method was used to determine the mics of 22 antibiotics against isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae (n=870), escherichia coli (n=684), enterobacter cloacae (n=342), enterobacter aerogenes (n=187) and serratia marcescens (n=135) as well as the mics of 11 antibiotics against isolates of staphylococcus aureus (n=1,606). overall, the susceptibility rate of enterobacteriaceae isolates was > or = 90% to 5 agents (meropenem, imipenem, amikacin, cefepime and gentamicin); 89-80% to 2 agents (ciprofloxacin and tobramycin); and <80% to 11 agents (cefotaxime, piperacillin-tazobactam, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cefetamet, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, aztreonam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, tetracycline, piperacillin, cefuroxime, chloramphenicol, ticarcillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate and amoxicillin). during the 3-year monitoring period, antibiotic susceptibility increased in klebsiella pneumoniae against amoxicillin-clavulanate, in escherichia coli against third-generation cephalosporins and aztreonam, in enterobacter aerogenes against amoxicillin and piperacillin-tazobactam and in serratia marcescens against most of the antibiotics. in contrast, enterobacter cloacae showed a tendency to develop resistance to cefetamet, amikacin and ciprofloxacin. of the total number of staphylococcus aureus strains, 38% were methicillin resistant. nearly 80% of the methicillin-resistant strains displayed  a multiresistance pattern (additional resistance to 2 or more non-beta-lactam antibiotics). rates of susceptibility of particular species (klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus) were compared using strains  from different geographical areas of italy (northern, central and southern) and from different nosocomial areas (outpatients, intensive care unit [icu] inpatients, non-icu inpatients). susceptibility of klebsiella pneumoniae to several antibiotics was lower in southern italy, whereas the incidence of methicillin-resistant strains was higher in northern and central italy. the susceptibility of escherichia coli was similar in all three areas. no significant differences in susceptibility of klebsiella pneumoniae or escherichia coli were found between strains from inpatients and outpatients or from inpatients admitted to icu and non-icu units. the incidence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was higher in icu inpatients (52%) than in non-icu inpatients (38%) and lower in outpatients (19%) than in inpatients.

TI  == [spread of enterobacteriaceae producing broad-spectrum beta-lactamase and the development of their incidence over a 16-month period in a university hospital center].
AB  == enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esble) constitute with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus the main multiresistant bacteria recovered in french hospitals. our objectives were to evaluate these esble diffusion in our teaching hospital and to follow their incidence during a 16-month period, whereas a control programme (barrier precautions) had been implemented in the beginning of 1999. this study was conducted in a teaching hospital containing 1800 beds, from february 1999 to may 2000. all esble isolated in clinical or screening samples were included. duplicates (same bacteria in the  same patient) were excluded. the detection of the esbl was performed with the double-disk diffusion test. incidence densities were determined with their 95% confidence interval (ci95%). their evolution by four-month period was evaluated with the chi-square test for trend. during the 16-month period, 229 esble were isolated. the incidence was 0.35 per 1000 patient-days (pd) (ci95% = [0.30-0.40]) for the whole hospital. it was 0.47/1000 pd (ci95% = [0.38-0.56]) in medical wards, 0.29/1000 pd (ci95% = [0.20-0.38]) in surgical wards and 1.32/1000 pd (ci95% = [0.90-1.74]) in intensive care units. enterobacter aerogenes strains represented more than 75% of all esble, whereas klebsiella pneumoniae stains represented only 8.6%. during the study, the incidence of esble and the proportion of strains acquired in our hospital decreased significantly (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.001 respectively). indeed, between the first eight-month period  and the last one, the incidence of esble acquired in our hospital decreased by 55%, whereas the incidence of imported strains increased slightly. this study shows that the diffusion of esble concerns the entire hospital. the implementation of a control programme of the spread of multiresistant bacteria allowed us to reduce significantly the incidence of esble. this incidence seemed  to be stable for several months. the implementation of a policy which restricts antimicrobial use would allow us to complete the the efficacy of barrier precautions.

TI  == electrochemical biosensor array for the identification of microorganisms based on lectin-lipopolysaccharide recognition.
AB  == rapid identification of bacterial strains remains a well-known problem in applied medicine and, for viable pathogens, is an important diagnostic goal. we have investigated an electrochemical biosensor array, in which transduction is based on respiratory cycle activity measurements, where the microorganism's native respiratory chain is interrupted with non-native external oxidants. the selective biochemical recognition agents employed in this study are lectins that, once immobilized, recognize and bind to cell surface lipopolysaccharides. porous membranes with different surface properties were examined as potential immobilization supports for these lectins. optimizations performed using concanavalin a and e. coli jm105 show that immobilization methods involving pre-activated membranes significantly reduce the time required to create a functional lectin layer on the membrane surface. overall, we found general agreement between agglutination test results and the electrochemical assessment of lectin-cell binding. chronocoulometric measurements were made for cells captured on lectin-modified immunodyne abc membranes physically affixed to pt working electrodes. this lectin-based sensor array was exposed to viable cells of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria as well as yeast, and chronocoulometric  measurements were used to generate a pattern of responses for each organism toward each lectin. principal component analysis was used to classify the chronocoulometric results for the different microbial strains. with this new method, six microbial species (baccilus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, saccharomyces cerevisiae) were readily distinguished.

TI  == multiple organ failure in septic patients.
AB  == multiple organ failure (mof) is the main cause of death in icus, especially affecting septic patients. it is strongly related to number of systems with failure, type of system involved, risk factors such as age, previous chronic diseases, delayed or inadequate resuscitation, persistent infection, immune suppression, and others. the prognoses is worse for patients rather than in elective or emergency surgical patients. the objective of this article is to provide data from our university teaching hospital icu related to the incidence of septic patients, the distribution of mof, and distribution of failure among each of the organs. the mortality rate, relationship between mortality and age, and mortality and types of organs affected were evaluated. the main bacterial causes of sepsis were also identified. a retrospective evaluation was done of 249 patients admitted to the icu in a 4 month period during 1999. fifty four patients had sepsis diagnosed by accs/sccm criteria. there were 37 men and 17 women; 24 medical and 30 post-surgical patients (9 after elective surgery and 21 emergency  patients). apache ii score was calculated on admission and mof, measured for the  first five days, was diagnosed using marshall and meakins criteria. the statistical method used was non-parametric mann-whitney test, p<0.05 was considered significant. the incidence of sepsis was recorded in 54/249 patients (22%). thirty of these 54 patients (56%) died. death occurred in 2 of 11 patients with one organ failure (18%), in 14/27 with 2 or 3 organ failures (52%), and 14/16 with 4 or more organ failures (88%). none of the three patients 15 to 20 years old died, 17/32 (55%) patients age 21-60 years, and >61 years 13/19 (68%),  died. there were 23 patients with positive bacterial culture. the most frequent bacteria found were: pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), multiresistant acinetobacter baumanii (3), staphylococcus epidermidis (3), enterobacter aerogenes (3), klebsiella pneumoniae (2) and multiresistant staphylococcus aureus (2). the mean  value +/- sd of apache ii (mortality risk) for survivors was 21 +/- 18 and for non-survivors 42 +/- 26 (p<0.001). we conclude that mof due to sepsis in an icu is frequent, with high mortality related to the number of failing organs, age and high apache ii.

TI  == evaluation of the contribution of isolation precautions in prevention and control of multi-resistant bacteria in a teaching hospital.
AB  == from february 1999 to january 2000, a control programme to prevent the spread multi-resistant bacteria (mrb) was implemented in a french teaching hospital. this programme focused on methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and  enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl), and was based on the application of barrier precautions (washing hands with antiseptic soaps, wearing disposable gloves and gowns, identifying mrb carriers). no changes in antibiotic policy occurred during the year. our aim was to conduct an evaluation of this programme by measuring incidence rates. concurrently, the effect of barrier precautions was estimated in an indirect way, by documenting the availability of barrier precautions in mrb carriers' rooms and by analysing the monthly correlation between the supply of such material and the theoretical cumulated length of mrb carriers' isolation in six randomized wards. all mrb isolated in hospitalized patients were recorded, and differentiated between acquisition in our hospital or from elsewhere. for the analysis of trends, the year was divided in three periods of four months. over the year, the global mrb incidence was 1.26 per 1000 patient-days (pd) [95% confidence interval (95%ci)=1.16-1.36]. the mrsa incidence was 0.89 per 1000 pd (95%ci=0.81- 0.97) and the esbl incidence was 0.38 per 1000 pd (95% ci=0.33-0.43). the mrb incidence decreased significantly in all types of specialties except for surgical wards. the incidence decreased by 17.9% for mrsa, 54.9% for esbl and 34.8% for both mrb. concurrently, the proportion of strains acquired in our hospital decreased for mrsa (p for trend > or = 0.05) and esbl (p for trend > or = 0.01), whereas the incidence of imported strains increased slightly. the proportion of multiresistant strains in s. aureus (36.8%) and enterobacter aerogenes (37.0%) remained similar throughout the year. thus, the decrease of the incidence concerned both resistant and susceptible strains. the availability of antiseptic  soaps increased significantly (p for trend > or = 0.01). the amount of antiseptic soap ordered and the theoretical lengths of isolation were correlated on a monthly basis (spearman coefficient = 0.72; p > or = 0.02). these results shows the efficacy of such a programme of mrb containment in a large hospital, provided barrier nursing is instigated, together with the availability of such material as antiseptic soap, to allow implementation.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and policy in belgium.
AB  == antibiotic resistance is increasing worldwide, also in belgium. a few examples to illustrate this problem: s. pneumoniae are becoming increasingly resistant to penicillin and erythromycin; resistance of s. pyogenes to erythromycin is increasing year-by-year; salmonella and campylobacter are becoming more and more  resistant to the fluoroquinolones. in hospitals, the problem of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus appears to be decreasing, but two clones of ceftazidime-resistant enterobacter aerogenes are spreading throughout the belgian hospitals. antibiotic resistance has become a serious health care issue both in hospitals and in the community. the popular press has termed some of the multiresistant organisms "killer bugs" or "superbugs". infection with such organisms has been associated with treatment failures, higher morbidity and mortality and increased costs. in this paper, we will review the problems of antibiotic resistance in the community setting. we will briefly discuss those pathogens with important consequences of morbidity and mortality in the community, such as: streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, neisseria meningitidis, the enteric pathogens salmonella and campylobacter, and the urinary tract pathogen e. coli. this resistance has in response to various conditions and opportunities, such as: clustering and overcrowding, increased number of immunodeficient patients, increased elderly population, population mobility, increased use of (broad-spectrum) antibiotics, over-the-counter sale and self-dosing with antibiotics, inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions and lack of  compliance, fewer resources for education and infection control, decreased funding for public health surveillance. in belgium, we should be able to develop, implement and evaluate a good antibiotic policy. our country has a wealth of information on antibiotic consumption in hospitals and the community. this information has been used for benchmarking of antibiotic consumption in hospitals. a unique system for reimbursement of prophylactic use of antibiotics in surgery was developed which resulted in a more adequate use of antibiotics. however, a policy should not be limited to the human ecosystem. therefore, a coordination commission for antibiotic policy was installed recently by the ministers of social affairs, public health and agriculture.

TI  == drug resistance in bacteria isolated from a brazilian hospital.
AB  == bacteria commonly associated with cases of hospital infection were isolated from  samples of food, from food handless, and from objects and surfaces from different places of a hospital in piracicaba, sao paulo, brazil, and the resistance patterns to antibiotic of these strains of bacteria were evaluated. the resistance patterns of these bacteria showed a large variation, and a high frequency of resistance to ampicillin (60.9%), cephalothin (58.7%) and carbenicillin (52.2%) was observed. the frequency of resistance to cephalosporins of 3rd and 4th-generations was 26.1% and 17.4% of the samples, respectively. resistance to more than two drugs was observed in 27 samples (56.5%), and in four strains multiple resistance to 17 or more tested drugs was recorded. five bacteria which were multi-resistant to antibiotics (enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, proteus sp, pseudomonas sp and staphylococcus aureus) were studied to determine the chromosomal or plasmidial genetic basis of the resistance, using plasmid curing and agarose gel electrophoresis of plasmidial dna. it was possible to verify that for the antibiotics chloramphenicol and kanamycin, the resistance seems to be of plasmidial origin.

TI  == [sensitivity to antibiotics of bacteria from nosocomial infections. evolution in  resuscitation services of military hospitals].
AB  == objective: the aim of this study, conducted in the french military hospitals, was to monitor the course of the antimicrobial sensibility of bacteria isolated from  nosocomial infection in intensive care units. patients and methods: a prospective study has been conducted from january to december 1998 in all the intensive care  units of the french army. all the non-repetitive strains isolated from nosocomial infection were collected and sent to a reference centre. antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the agar dilution method. beta-lactamase were identified by iso-electro-focalisation. antibiotics choice and interpretative criteria were those of the "comite francais de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiologie". results: a total of 849 strains are included in this study. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated bacterium (20%) followed by escherichia coli (19%) staphylococcus aureus (15%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (11%) and enterococci (7%). imipenem was  the most effective antibiotic against enterobacteriaceae (336 isolates; 100% susceptibility). gentamicin (92%), amikacin (92%) third generation cephalosporins (83%), aztreonam (83%) and ciprofloxacin (78%) were also very effective. resistance to iii generation cephalosporins was correlated with an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (blse) in 36% of cases. this blse could be associated with an over production of the constitutive cephalosporinase. the most frequent species producing blse were enterobacter aerogenes (75% of blse) and klebsiella pneumoniae (17%). among the 172 p. aeruginosa isolated, antimicrobial susceptibility were respectively: 71% for imipenem, 62%: tobramycin, 60%: amikacin 59%: ciprofloxacin 59% piperacillin + tazobactam, 55% piperacillin, 53%: ceftazidime and 44% for ticarcillin. seventy per cent of the 96 cons and 50.2% of the 126 s. aureus isolated were resistant to methicillin. a strain of s. aureus and 2 cons strains had intermediate resistance to teicoplanin. twenty per cent of the 59 enterococci strains isolated were resistant to aminopenicillins (10/11 strains of e. faecium), and 9% presented a high level of resistance to gentamicine. one strain of e. faecium was resistant to vancomycin. conclusion: the evolution of the susceptibility to antibiotics in intensive care units reflects the antibiotic pressure and level of cross-transmission. high rates of meticillin-resistance among staphylococci, of resistance to beta-lactams antibiotics among p. aeruginosa and of ciprofloxacin among enterobacteriaceae are shown in this study. the implementation of appropriate strategies for surveillance and prevention is necessary.

TI  == photochemical inactivation of bacteria and hiv in buffy-coat-derived platelet concentrates under conditions that preserve in vitro platelet function.
AB  == background and objectives: a photochemical process has been tested for the inactivation of viruses and bacteria in buffy-coat derived platelet concentrates  (bc pcs). materials and methods: bc pcs in 35% cpd plasma and 65% platelet-additive solution (pas iii) were exposed to photochemical treatment (pct) with 150 microm of the psoralen s-59 and a 3 j/cm(2) treatment with long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva, 320-400 nm). platelet function was evaluated following pct using a panel of in vitro assays. results: this pct process was highly effective at inactivating gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia  marcescens). no viable bacteria were detected following pct and 7 days of platelet storage while bacterial growth was detected in paired untreated control  bc pcs. complete inactivation of the gram-positive bacillus cereus was achieved only in one of two replicate experiments with bc pcs. pct was also highly effective for inactivation of human immunodeficiency virus hiv-1 in bc pcs inoculated with approximately 10(6) tissue culture infectious doses per milliliter (tcid(50)/ml) of cell-associated hiv-1. rapid inactivation was observed with increasing uva doses: with 150 microm s-59 and a 1 j/cm(2) treatment of uva, a reduction of 5.6+/-0.5 log tcid(50)/ml was achieved, and a reduction of >6.4 log tcid(50)/ml was achieved with 150 microm s-59 and a 3 j/cm(2) treatment of uva. no physiologically relevant differences in platelet functions were found between the test and the control bc pcs during 7 days of storage. conclusion: pct with 150 microm s-59 and a 3 j/cm(2) uva treatment does  not adversely affect in vitro properties of bc pcs stored at 22 degrees c for 7 days. the pct process inactivated bacteria and hiv-1 inoculated into the bc pcs.  these results extend the earlier reported efficacy of pct apheresis pcs to bc pcs.

TI  == biosynthesis of pyridoxine: origin of the nitrogen atom of pyridoxine in microorganisms.
AB  == the amide nitrogen atom of glutamine was incorporated into pyridoxine in four eukaryotes, emericella nidulans, mucor racemosus, neurospora crassa and saccharomyces cerevisiae, and two prokaryotes, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis, but not in the following prokaryotes, pseudomonas putida, enterobacter  aerogenes and escherichia coli. on the other hand, the nitrogen atom of glutamate was incorporated into pyridoxine in p. putida, e. aerogenes and e. coli, but not  in s. aureus and b. subtilis. these results suggest that there are at least two different biosynthetic routes for pyridoxine and the difference does not depend on prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

TI  == role of infection control measures in limiting morbidity associated with multi-resistant organisms in critically ill patients.
AB  == a retrospective comparative study was performed to determine the impact of infection control measures (icms) on colonization and infections due to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), klebsiella pneumoniae (producing transferable extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, kpesbl), and multi-resistant enterobacter aerogenes (mrea) in intensive care unit patients. infection control measures included surveillance cultures, isolation procedures and mupirocin for mrsa nasal carriage. the numbers of patients infected and/or colonized by mrsa, kpesbl or mrea were compared during two consecutive one-year periods (period 1 before icms, and period 2 after icms). the antibiotic consumption during the two periods was analysed. in period 1 and period 2, respectively, the rate of patients infected or colonized by at least one of the three organisms was 15% and 6.8% (p=0.001); by mrsa 7.7% and 2.6% (p=0. 004); by  kpesbl 1.7% and 0% (p=0.25); and by mrea 5.6% and 4.3% (p=0. 47). during period 2, there was a clear-cut decrease in the percentage of patients infected by mrsa  (p=0.018), a non-significant decrease in those infected by kpesbl (p=0.06), and no decrease in patients infected by mrea (p=0.22). when calculated per 1000 patient-days, for period 1 and period 2, respectively, the rate of patients infected or colonized by at least one of the three organisms was 11.9 and 8.8; for mrsa it was 4 and 2.2; for kpesbl it was 1 and 0; and for mrea it was 4 and 4. antibiotic cost was pound98.7 in period 1 and pound62.7 in period 2. icms contributed to the control of infections and colonizations due to mrsa and kpesbl but not those due to mrea.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the usa.
AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

TI  == mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  == 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. the 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. the implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included enterobacter species (enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), klebsiella species (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca), escherichia coli, staphylococcus species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus, serratia marcescens, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus viridans and neisseria meningitidis. six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included e. cloacae in one, a. baumannii in one, k. pneumoniae in one and s. aureus in three. the management of  these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the  high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. however, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.

TI  == comparison of five beta-lactam antibiotics against common nosocomial pathogens using the time above mic at different creatinine clearances.
AB  == study objective: to compare the time above the minimum inhibitory concentration (t>mic) for five parenteral beta-lactam antibiotics against common nosocomial bacterial pathogens at different creatinine clearances (clcr). interventions: serum concentration-time profiles were simulated for cefepime, ceftazidime, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and imipenem at clcr ranging from 120-30 ml/minute. the mic data for 90% of organisms (mic90) were collected for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and a weighted geometric mean mic90 was calculated. the t>mic was calculated as percentage of the dosing interval in which free concentrations exceeded the weighted geometric mean mic90. a t>mic of 70% or greater was considered desirable for all organisms except s. aureus (> or = 50%). measurements and main results: cefepime 2 g every 12 hours (clcr > or = 70 ml/min) and every 24 hours (clcr < or = 60 ml/min) achieved desirable t>mic for all enterobacteriaceae and s. aureus at every clcr. imipenem  0.5 g achieved desirable t>mic for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, c. freundii, and s. aureus at every clcr. however, imipenem t>mic was less than 70% for the following regimens and organisms: s. marcescens 0.5 g every 6 hours (clcr > or = 90 ml/min), e. aerogenes 0.5 g every 6 hours (clcr > or = 80 ml/min), e. cloacae 0.5 g every 6 hours (clcr > or = 100 ml/min), s. marcescens 0.5 g every 8 hours (clcr 60-70 ml/min), e. cloacae 0.5 g every 8 hours (clcr 60-70 ml/min), and e. aerogenes 0.5 g every 8 hours (clcr 50-70 ml/min). ceftazidime 2 g every 8 hours  (clcr 60-100 ml/min) and every 12 hours (clcr 40-50 ml/min) achieved desirable t>mic for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and s. aureus only. at every dose and clcr, piperacillintazobactam achieved desirable t>mic for s. aureus but  not for any enterobacteriaceae at clcr > 50 ml/minute. piperacillin did not achieve desirable t>mic for any organism, and none of the beta-lactams attained a t>mic of 70% or above for p. aeruginosa at any clcr. conclusion: at every clcr, cefepime achieved a desirable t>mic for more nosocomial pathogens than any other  beta-lactam evaluated. based on pharmacodynamic data, cefepime is an appropriate  empiric choice for treatment of nosocomial infections. however, when p. aeruginosa is a potential pathogen, empiric combination therapy should be considered.

TI  == development of an infection-resistant lvad driveline: a novel approach to the prevention of device-related infections.
AB  == background: infection remains the single most important challenge to extended left ventricular assist device (lvad) use and often arises from the percutaneous  driveline exit site. we evaluated the ability of an lvad driveline prototype impregnated with chlorhexidine, triclosan, and silver sulfadiazine to resist bacterial and fungal colonization. methods: the spectrum and duration of antimicrobial activity were evaluated in vitro by daily transfer of driveline segments embedded on agar plates inoculated with 10(8) colony-forming units (cfu) of staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), staphlococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, psuedomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans, and then measuring zones of inhibition around the sample subsequent to 24 hours of incubation at 37 degrees c. antimicrobial activity was demonstrated against all organisms for greater than 14 days, and for over 21 days for gram-positive bacteria. to demonstrate in vivo efficacy of the treated driveline, 3-cm segments of driveline were implanted in the dorsal and ventral surface of rats. the exit site was inoculated with 10(6) cfu of s. aureus. after 7 days, driveline segments were aseptically explanted and assayed for bacterial colonization and retention of antimicrobial activity. one hundred percent of control segments were colonized (10(5) cfu s. aureus/cm) as against 13% of the test explants (< or = 330 cfu/cm;  p < 0.0001). results: subcultures of the insertion site and driveline pocket tissue resulted in 10(3) to 10(5) cfu per swab culture for control rats and 0 to  10(2) cfu/swab for test animals. test drivelines retained 80% of anti-s. aureus activity. gross and histological examination of the driveline and surrounding pocket revealed minimal tissue reactivity with positive signs of tissue ingrowth. conclusion: an antimicrobial driveline may prevent early infections and facilitate ingrowth of tissue to provide long-term stability and protection against late infection.

TI  == bacteraemia in the adult intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in nottingham, uk, 1985-1996.
AB  == bacteraemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit. in this study the distribution of organisms causing bacteraemic episodes in patients in the adult intensive care unit of a large teaching hospital was determined. particular emphasis was placed on the type of organisms  isolated from community- and hospital-acquired bacteraemia, the suspected source  of infection, the possible risk factors associated with bacteraemia, and outcome. the incidence of bacteraemia and fungaemia increased from 17.7 per 1000 admissions in 1985 to 80.3 in 1996. a total of 315 episodes of bacteraemia and fungaemia were documented over a 12-year period, of which 18% were considered community-acquired and 82% hospital-acquired. gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 46.9% and 31.5% of the episodes, respectively. polymicrobial infection accounted for 17.8% and fungi for 3.8% of the episodes. staphylococcus aureus (22.5%), staphylococcus epidermidis (7.6%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (7.9%) were the predominant gram-positive bacteria implicated, whereas escherichia coli (6%), enterobacter cloacae (7%), klebsiella  aerogenes (3.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.1%), and acinetobacter spp. (3.8%) were the predominant gram-negative bacteria isolated. the two most common sources of infection were the respiratory tract (39.7%) and an intravascular line (24.5%), but in 8.9% of episodes the focus of infection remained unknown. bacteraemic patients stayed in the unit for a longer period (12 days) than did non-bacteraemic patients (3 days). the overall mortality related to bacteraemia and candidaemia was 44.4%. surveillance of bacteraemia in the intensive care unit is important in detecting major changes in aetiology, e.g., the increasing incidence of gram-positive bacteraemia, the emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in 1995, and the emergence of enterobacter cloacae. it is of value in determining empirical antimicrobial therapy to treat presumed infection pending a microbiological diagnosis and in directing the development of guidelines for infection prevention, e.g., guidelines for central venous catheter care.

AB  == we calculated the magnitude of various serum pharmacodynamic parameters for fluoroquinolones in models of experimental endocarditis (ee) described in the literature. nineteen publications contained data that allowed calculation of these parameters. data were available for eight fluoroquinolones against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, viridans streptococci, enterobacter aerogenes, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in rabbit or rat models. enterococci were excluded because of poor bactericidal activity. a 24-hour area under the concentration curve (auc)/minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) ratio  > or = 100, a peak level/mic ratio > 8, and continuous levels above the time were associated with a significantly lower number of cfu per vegetation after 3-6 days of therapy. the 24-hour auc/mic exhibited the best linear correlation with cfu per vegetation after 3-6 days of therapy (r2 = 45%). the pharmacodynamic parameters predictive of efficacy for fluoroquinolones in the treatment of experimental endocarditis are similar to those for other infectious models.

TI  == tungiasis among five communities in south-western trinidad, west indies.
AB  == the prevalences of tunga penetrans linn. within the five townships of granville,  fullerton, icacos, coromandel and cedros in south-western trinidad, west indies,  as determined by physical examination of all inhabitants present during the survey, were 17.0% (38/223 subjects), 15.7% (36/237), 31.4% (102/325), 17.4% (42/242) and 17.9% (50/280), respectively. the rate in icacos was significantly higher than in the other four sites (p < 0.001). not only were males more likely  to be infected than females in all five study sites (p < 0.0007) but chigoe-flea  burdens were also higher in males than in females (p < 0.012), with mean (s.d.) burdens of 5.44 (2.54) fleas/male infected subject and 2.38 (2.00) fleas/female infected subject. feet were significantly more infected than other areas of the body (p < 0.001). analysis of variance revealed that the interactions between prevalence of chigoe-flea infection and geographical location (p = 0.0058) and between sex of infected subject and site of infection (p = 0.0109) were highly significant but that between geographical location and sex of infected subject was not significant (p > 0.30). at least seven species of bacteria, with varying  sensitivities to antibiotics, were isolated from 16 patients with sepsis associated with their t. penetrans infections: streptococcus pyogenes, beta-haemolytic streptococcus (not group a), klebsiella aerogenes, enterobacter agglomerans, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and a bacillus species. closteridium tetani was not isolated.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

TI  == comparison of axenic and monoxenic media for isolation of acanthamoeba.
AB  == acanthamoeba is a genus of ubiquitous, free-living amebae that can be difficult to isolate by standard microbiologic techniques. we retrospectively reviewed the  laboratory records of patients with ocular acanthamoebic infection for the period from january 1973 to june 1996 and found that acanthamoeba isolates were recovered from 73, 71, and 70% of clinical specimens inoculated onto buffered charcoal-yeast extract agar (bcye), nonnutrient agar with live or dead escherichia coli, and tryptic soy agar (tsa) with horse or sheep blood, respectively. we then prospectively compared the recovery of a corneal isolate of acanthamoeba on commercial media from remel and bbl (tsa with 5% sheep blood, tsa with 5% horse blood, tsa with 5% rabbit blood, v agar, chocolate agar, bcye, and  selective bcye with polymyxin b, anisomycin, and vancomycin) and on axenic and monoxenic media prepared with live or dead bacteria (enterobacter aerogenes, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia). good recovery of trophozoites was obtained on bcye, tsa with rabbit blood, tsa with horse blood, and remel tsa with sheep blood. bbl tsa with horse blood or rabbit blood provided good recovery of cysts. all species of live or dead bacteria yielded good recovery of trophozoites; however, only nonnutrient agar with live p. aeruginosa, live e. aerogenes, or live s. maltophilia gave good recovery of cysts. tsa with either rabbit blood or horse blood, bcye, and nonnutrient agar prepared with live p. aeruginosa, e. aerogenes, or s. maltophilia offer optimal recovery of acanthamoeba.

TI  == comparative activity of eight antimicrobial agents against clinical bacterial isolates from the united states, measured by two methods.
AB  == in a surveillance study conducted during 1992-1993 at 83 medical institutions of  different types and sizes (e.g., laboratories, community hospitals, teaching hospitals) and from different geographical areas of the united states, clinical bacterial isolates were tested for their susceptibility to eight comparative antimicrobial agents (cefepime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, imipenem, and piperacillin). a total of 12,574 isolates were tested by either the etest method (ab biodisk) or a microdilution method (microscan) in the participating laboratories; 11.8% of these isolates were subsequently retested for quality assurance purposes by both methods in a central laboratory. the results obtained in the central laboratory were essentially the same as the results obtained in the participating laboratories. this article presents data for gram-negative and gram-positive isolates other than streptococcus pneumoniae, the results of which have been previously published. antimicrobial susceptibility results obtained with the two different minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) methods--microscan and etest--showed that  most isolates of enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to cefepime, exceeding the activity of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefotaxime, principally because of the  greater activity of cefepime against the species that produce bush group 1 beta-lactamases (predominantly enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and  citrobacter freundii). in addition, the activity of cefepime against pseudomonas  aeruginosa isolates was essentially equivalent to that of ceftazidime and greater than that of third-generation cephalosporins. most methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to all the cephalosporins, whereas methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococci were resistant. overall, the most active antimicrobials in this study were imipenem, ciprofloxacin, and cefepime, but the activity of all the antimicrobials varied with different species. categorically, the results from the microdilution and etest methods were equivalent.

AB  == results are reported for agar dilution susceptibility testing of 3,075 isolates of aerobic bacteria collected from >200 u.s. institutions, located in 30 different states. these isolates were collected from 1987 through 1991 from patients who participated in cefepime clinical trials. cefepime susceptibility was compared with ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefoperazone, and imipenem. to avoid duplication of strains, only initial isolates were included. cefepime minimum inhibitory concentration (mic90) values for enterobacteriaceae were < or = 0.5 microg/ml, except for two species, citrobacter freundii and providencia stuartii, with mic90 values of 2 and 1, respectively. the mic90 values of the other cephalosporins were higher, especially for enterobacter aerogenes and c. freundii. the mic90 values of cefepime for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (4 microg/ml) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 microg/ml) were similar to those of cefotaxime for s. aureus (4 microg/ml), and to ceftazidime for p. aeruginosa (8 microg/ml). streptococcus pneumoniae was similar in susceptibility to cefotaxime at 0.06 microg/ml. the activity of cefepime against a diverse group of gram-positive and gram-negative (1987-1991) bacteria isolates demonstrates the excellent activity of cefepime compared to third-generation cephalosporins and imipenem, particularly among c. freundii and e. aerogenes isolates, which were often resistant to other cephalosporins.

AB  == the serum bactericidal activities of ceftizoxime and ceftriaxone against organisms commonly implicated in community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonias were studied. ceftizoxime 1 g (as the sodium salt) every 12 hours for two doses and ceftriaxone 1 g (as the sodium salt) every 24 hours for two doses were administered to 20 healthy volunteers in a crossover fashion. blood samples were  drawn immediately before and 2,4,6,8,10, and 12 hours after the second ceftizoxime dose and immediately before and 8,12,16,18,20, and 24 hours after the second ceftriaxone dose. serum drug concentrations were determined by validated high-performance liquid chromatography. serum bactericidal titers were determined in duplicate for each serum sample against four clinical isolates of each of the  following organisms: streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, and  serratia marcescens. the median duration of serum bactericidal activity during the dosage interval was significantly different between antimicrobial regimens only for s. pneumoniae (92% of the dosage interval for ceftizoxime, versus 100% for ceftriaxone). this difference does not appear to be clinically important since ceftizoxime provides adequate serum bactericidal activity for more than 50% of the dosage interval and its effectiveness against pneumococcal pneumonia has been supported in clinical trials. the ceftriaxone and ceftizoxime regimens did not differ significantly in their duration of serum bactericidal activity against six of the seven organisms tested.

TI  == polymerase chain reaction of bacterial genomes with single universal primer: application to distinguishing mycobacteria species.
AB  == the polymerase chain reaction with a single universal primer (up-pcr) was applied to bacterial strains and mycobacteria isolates alongside conventional methods. a  universal protocol of preparation of pcr samples from cultures representing escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, mycobacterium tuberculosis, mycobacterium bovis, and several non-tuberculous mycobacteria was found to be reproducible and efficient with these organisms. the bands of up-pcr  products observed in an agarose gel after electrophoresis were species-specific and provided an efficient means of distinguishing bacterial species. the applicability of this approach to mycobacteria identification was assessed by comparing the dna bands obtained for different strains. three reference strains and 22 clinical isolates of m. tuberculosis and m. bovis produced very similar dna banding patterns. they comprised a triplet of prominent and several minor fragments within the 200-500 base pair (bp) size range and were the easiest to interpret. the dna profiles of unrelated mycobacteria clearly differed from each  other when subjected to electrophoretic analysis and correlated well with results of culture method. the method provides a real promise of its application in clinical studies as a simple assay for distinguishing between tubercle bacilli.

AB  == cefepime (cp) is a new injectable cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity and stability against common chromosomally and plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases.  the bactericidal activities of cp, ceftazidime (cz), cefotaxime (ctx), and ceftriaxone (cax) against reference and clinical strains of staphylococcus aureus, an isogenic pair of enterobacter aerogenes strains (wild type and a cz-resistant derepressed mutant), and a klebsiella pneumoniae isolate possessing  a tem-10 beta-lactamase were investigated in a two-compartment pharmacodynamic in vitro infection model which simulates human pharmacokinetics. an inoculum of approximately 10(6) cfu/ml was used in all model experiments. antibiotics were administered to simulate the following regimens: cp at 2 g every 12 h (q12h), cz  at 2 g q8h, ctx at 2 g q8h, and cax at 2 g q24h. human albumin was added during experiments with cax and staphylococci to simulate protein binding. samples were  removed at multiple time points over a 48-h period to determine the inoculum size for time-kill curves. development of resistance was detected by inoculating samples obtained at 0, 24, and 48 h onto antibiotic-containing agar plates. the time to 99.9% killing was used to compare drug regimens. against staphylococci, the time to bacterial eradication was significantly delayed with cax-albumin. all regimens had similar activities against the wild-type enterobacter strain; however, regrowth was noted with cz, ctx, and cax against the cz-resistant strain. there were no differences between the cp, ctx, and cax regimens against k. pneumoniae. of interest, no regrowth of any organism was noted with cp. these  data indicate that cp has activity against s.aureus and cz-resistant gram-negative bacilli.

TI  == nucleotide sequence of the staphylococcus aureus signal peptidase ii (lsp) gene.
AB  == the lsp gene encoding prolipoprotein signal peptidase (signal peptidase ii) of staphylococcus aureus was cloned by screening a genomic library for plasmid clones capable of complementing a conditionally lethal lsp allele of escherichia  coli. e. coli cells carrying one of five overlapping clones exhibited increased resistance to globomycin. the nucleotide sequence of the s. aureus lsp gene was determined. the deduced amino acid sequence of the signal peptidase ii of s. aureus suggests that this enzyme has a hydropathy profile very similar to those of e. coli, enterobacter aerogenes and pseudomonas fluorescens. comparison of the primary structures of this enzyme from these four distinct bacterial species reveals three highly conserved domains in proteins which have a low degree of overall sequence homology. unlike the lsp genes from the gram-negative bacteria,  the lsp gene in s. aureus is not flanked by x-iles and orf149-orf316 as found in  e. coli, ent. aerogenes, and p. fluorescens.

TI  == cefpodoxime: comparative antibacterial activity, influence of growth conditions,  and bactericidal activity.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime, the active metabolite of the new cephalosporin ester cefpodoxime proxetil, in comparison to cefixime, cefotiam, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime was determined against a broad spectrum of freshly isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. cefpodoxime was demonstrated to be inhibitory at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 90% of strains of moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli (beta-lactamase- negative strains), klebsiella spp., serratia spp., proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia spp., and salmonella spp.  this antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was generally superior to that of cefuroxime and similar to that of cefixime. cefpodoxime was active at less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 50% of the members of beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter spp., and morganella morganii. cefpodoxime proved to be highly inhibitory against group a, b, and g streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90 less than 0.015 mg/l). the mics of cefpodoxime and those of the other cephalosporins were less than 2 mg/l for greater than or equal to 90% of the strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, with the exception of cefixime which had no activity with mics below 8 mg/l against these bacteria. pseudomonas spp., acinetobacter spp., and enterococcus spp. were resistant to cefpodoxime. the antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime was only to a minor degree influenced by different growth conditions with the exception of high inoculum sizes against some beta-lactamase producing strains of gram-negative bacilli.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the effect of physical and microbiological factors on food container leakage.
AB  == the effect of physical and microbiological factors on food container leakage was  investigated in a container leakage model system (clms). the leakage of acinetobacter calcoaceticus, staphylococcus sp., pseudomonas sp., bacillus sp., a coryneform, staph. aureus, and two biotest organisms (enterobacter cloacae nc1b 8151 and ent. aerogenes mb31) was studied. the rate of bacterial leakage (log10 cells/channel/s) was greater in the presence of a partial vacuum of 51-305 mm hg  than at atmospheric pressure. fluid flow (ml) through leakage channels was increased by the application of vacuum. leakage varied with vacuum, bacterial morphology, cell concentration, leakage channel size (0.78-120 micron 2) and channel shape (straight or convoluted). the number of leaked cells was not proportional to vacuum or channel size. the effect of channel shape varied with bacterial species. increased container medium viscosity decreased bacterial leakage. fluid flow through leakage channels was generally reduced by the most viscous solution. cells from biofilms and monolayers of ac. calcoaceticus or staph. aureus attached to nylon (hyfax) or stainless steel surfaces underwent leakage. mixed bacterial populations had characteristic leakage rates against vacuum different from the leakage pattern of individual species in the population. the composition of the leaked population was different from the original inoculum. the results indicated that container leakage is a complex process involving a range of interdependent factors.

TI  == ofloxacin versus vancomycin/polymyxin for prevention of infections in granulocytopenic patients.
AB  == introduction: the efficacy and safety of oral ofloxacin were compared with those  of vancomycin/polymyxin for prophylaxis of bacterial infections in granulocytopenic patients undergoing chemotherapy for hematologic malignancy. patients and methods: antimicrobial prophylaxis was begun at the time of initiation of chemotherapy. thirty patients received ofloxacin tablets (300 mg orally every 12 hours) plus a nystatin suspension. thirty-two patients received vancomycin capsules (500 mg orally every eight hours) and polymyxin capsules (100 mg orally every eight hours) plus a nystatin suspension. results: in the group of patients receiving ofloxacin, there were a lower number of acquired gram-negative bacillary organisms per patient (0.13 versus 1.37, p less than 0.00005), fewer patients with documented infection (11 of 30 versus 21 of 32, p = 0.04), and fewer cases of gram-negative septicemia (zero of 30 versus five of 32, p = 0.05). ofloxacin was also better tolerated (24 of 30 versus 10 of 32 patients highly compliant, p = 0.01) and associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects (one of 30 versus nine of 32 patients with gastrointestinal side effects, p = 0.01) than vancomycin/polymyxin. however, except for a reduction of staphylococcus aureus colonization and infection by ofloxacin, neither ofloxacin nor vancomycin/polymyxin was effective in eliminating colonization or infection with  viridans group streptococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, or other gram-positive organisms. only three isolates of ofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, and enterobacter aerogenes) were isolated from surveillance cultures, but none caused infection. conclusion: these results suggest that oral ofloxacin is a more tolerable and efficacious alternative to vancomycin/polymyxin for prevention of serious gram-negative bacillary infections in granulocytopenic patients. more effective prophylaxis of gram-positive infections, however, is still needed.

TI  == new screening test to determine the acceptability of 0.45-micron membrane filters for analysis of water.
AB  == during routine membrane filter (mf) quality control testing, irregularities such  as partial or complete inhibition of microbial growth at grid lines, abnormal spreading of colonies, growth in or along the grid lines, nonwetting areas, poor  colony sheen and metallic sheen on the mf surface with mendo agar, brittleness, decreased recovery, and severe wrinkling were observed with several lots of filters. to study these effects and to develop a more sensitive screening test for mf quality, we compared five different mfs with various types and degrees of  defects by using five stock coliform cultures and five different media. results showed that the enterobacter aerogenes-tryptic soy agar test system detected more mf defects than any other combination did and was superior to the escherichia coli-mfc agar american society for testing and materials method for grid line inhibition. filtered natural samples grown on the same media showed the same effects as were observed with the pure cultures. poor colony sheen and sheen on the mf surface were best detected with enterobacter aerogenes on mendo agar. the  use of tryptic soy agar and mendo agar with this organism permitted the maximum detection of mf irregularities. of the 142 mf lots tested by this method, 30% were acceptable, 10% were marginally acceptable, and 61% were unacceptable. this  method provides a valuable screening test for determining the acceptability of 0.45-microm-pore-size mfs used for coliform and heterotroph analysis and may also be useful in conjunction with other methods.

TI  == [clinical studies on sulbactam/ampicillin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  == during 8 months from october 1986 to may 1987, the clinical efficacy of sulbactam/ampicillin (sbt/abpc) was evaluated in 63 pediatric inpatients with various infections. clinical efficacies were evaluable in 58 patients among them  (consisting of 2 patients with sepsis, 3 with tonsillitis, 12 with bronchitis, 6  with bronchopneumonia, 24 with pneumonia, 1 with phlegmon, 2 with lymphadenitis,  1 with impetigo and 7 with urinary tract infection) and were excellent in 40 patients and good in 17 with an overall efficacy rate of 98.3%. bacteriological efficacies were assessed in 25 patients and 27 strains of organisms (consisting of 3 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 2 streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 streptococcus pyogenes, 2 beta-streptococcus, 1 gram-positive cocci, 5 escherichia coli, 1 enterobacter aerogenes, 7 haemophilus influenzae, 2 haemophilus parainfluenzae, 1 branhamella catarrhalis, 1 proteus mirabilis and 1  salmonella subgenus i). bacteriological eradication rates were 88.9% for gram-positive organisms, 66.7% for gram-negative organisms and 74.1% overall. no  superinfection was observed in any of patients treated. side effects and clinical laboratory parameter abnormalities observed consisted of diarrhea in 7 (11.1%) of the 63 patients, eosinophilia in 2 (3.3%) of 61 tested, thrombocytosis in 3 (5.5%) of 55, elevation of direct bilirubin in 1 (3.3%) of 30, elevation of total bilirubin in 1 (3.1%) of 32, elevation of got in 4 (6.8%) of 59 and elevation of  gpt in 1 (1.7%) of 59 patients tested. as an effect on the hemostatic mechanism of this drug, pivka ii was detected in 1 patient (4.2%) of 24 tested, but findings of other coagulation tests were normal and none of patients showed bleeding tendency or inhibition of platelet aggregation. from the above results,  it appears that sbt/abpc is an efficacious and safe drug in the treatment of bacterial infections of pediatric patients.

TI  == in vitro susceptibility of bacteria to a ticarcillin-clavulanic acid combination.
AB  == in vitro testing of bacterial susceptibility to a combination of ticarcillin and  clavulanic acid was done, using 406 aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative isolates (considered to be pathogens) cultured from equine and small animal specimens. a microdilution broth technique of susceptibility testing was performed, using trays with wells containing a range of doubling concentrations of dehydrated ticarcillin (range, 0.50 to 128 micrograms/ml) with fixed concentration of clavulanic acid (4 micrograms/ml). the following isolates of equine origin were (90%) susceptible to concentrations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid combinations of less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively: staphylococcus aureus, s intermedius, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, ent agglomerans, ent cloacae, escherichia coli, actinobacillus sp, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, rhodococcus equi, proteus  vulgaris, and bordetella bronchiseptica. isolates of small animal origin (90%) susceptible to less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms of ticarcillinclavulanic/ml included s aureus, s intermedius, ent aerogenes, ent agglomerans, pasteurella multocida, b bronchiseptica, pr mirabilis, and serratia  sp.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of sulbactam/cefoperazone].
AB  == sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz) is a preparation containing cpz and sbt, an inhibitor of beta-lactamases, at the ratio 1:1. the reliability of the sbt/cpz disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics and the utilization of the test in the evaluation of proper administrative doses were studied using 365 strains of clinical isolates. the antimicrobial activity of sbt/cpz was stronger than that of cpz alone. this increase in the antimicrobial activity due to the addition of sbt was well observed in the disc diffusion susceptibility test and mic values. the mic80 of sbt/cpz against staphylococcus aureus was 12.5 micrograms/ml, while that of cpz alone was 50 micrograms/ml. mic80s of sbt/cpz against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes were smaller than those of cpz, and were 0.20, 12.5, 25 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. however, mic80s of sbt/cpz against staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and  proteus vulgaris were not changed compared to those of cpz alone, and mic80s were 6.25, 0.20, 0.78, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. the reliability of the sbt/cpz disc diffusion susceptibility test in the quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs prepared in this laboratory, both of which  contained 30 micrograms of cpz and 30 micrograms of sbt. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the sbt/cpz disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of approximate mic values. to interpret results of the showa sbt/cpz disc test, the following 4 category classification was used: ( inverted question mark) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark 3 micrograms/ml less than mic  less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark15 micrograms/ml  less than mic less than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. in both 6 and 8 mm diameter disc tests, when uniform break points  of inhibitory zone diameter were similarly applied to all strains isolated clinically, some strains of s. aureus, e. faecalis, and p. aeruginosa, brought false positive (susceptible) results showing slightly greater inhibitory zone diameters compared to mics. however, if different break points against p. aeruginosa as indicated in this study were applied and e. faecalis was excluded from the test, excellent results were obtained in the quantitative estimation of  mics. antimicrobial activities of antibiotic agents have been reported to be reduced by serum protein binding.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach in estimating the effective dosage of cefamandole].
AB  == reliability of the cefamandole (cmd) disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics was studied using various clinical isolates totaling 246 strains with showa discs (8 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of cmd). clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the cmd disc tests, which is normally used in japan, was also evaluated to determine whether this system would be suitable or not for the evaluation of a proper dose  of administration. the results obtained with the disc method were compared with mics determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. the results of the cmd disc susceptibility test were well correlated with mics, showing the reliability of the disc method to estimate approximate values of mics. break points in mic values proposed for the classification of bacteria into 4 categories of susceptibility are () mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. only 4 (1.6%) out the 246 strains tested showed false positive results and 11 (4.5%) showed false negative results, showing the excellent reliability of this test. in this study,  approximately 90% of strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis isolated from clinical materials randomly were inhibited by cmd at concentrations less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes were sensitive to cmd at 67 and 69% of strains, respectively, at concentrations below 6.25 micrograms/ml. cmd was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens and enterococcus faecalis. about 90% of staphylococcus aureus were inhibited at dose levels smaller than 6.25 micrograms/ml and 70% of the strains at levels less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. susceptibilities to 15 micrograms/ml cmd of highly methicillin-resistant strains  (mic greater than 30 micrograms/ml) of s. aureus were examined. ten of 12 strains examined were found susceptible to cmd, but only 6 of the 12 to cefmetazole. imipenem/cilastatin was effective to 5 of the 12 strains at levels lower than 3 micrograms/ml and to one at a level less than 15 micrograms/ml. minocycline was effective against 11 strains at concentrations below 2 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating the effective administrative dose of latamoxef. significance of a 4-category system interpretation of the latamoxef disc susceptibility test].
AB  == in vitro activities of latamoxef (lmox) against 249 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. lmox was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis (except 2 out of 30 strains) and proteus vulgaris with mic values below 3.13 micrograms/ml. it was also active against enterobacter aerogenes with mic80  of 1.56 micrograms/ml. lmox was less active against serratia marcescens, inhibiting about 43% of strains at a level of 6.25 micrograms/ml. it was also less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, showing mic80 of 12.5 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. lmox was not active against enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the reliability of the lmox disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (difco), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of lmox. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the lmox disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of lmox. for the interpretation of lmox disc test results, if uniform break points of zone diameters were used to test all bacteria, inhibitory zone diameters of showa discs used on staphylococcus were relatively large compared to mics determined, probably due to decarboxylation of lmox sodium salt in the discs. however, those of difco discs were not, because difco discs use lmox ammonium salt. both discs also showed relatively large inhibitory zone diameters  compared to mics determined against p. aeruginosa. using different break points from those used for other bacteria to interpret inhibition zones for staphylococcus and p. aeruginosa, these disc susceptivility tests should be useful to estimate approximate mics. a 3 category system for the interpretation of disc test results has been used in usa and europe, but a 4 category system is  generally used in japan. the 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to mic values as follows:  resistant (r) mic greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml, intermediate (i) mic 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (s) mic less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. the 4 category system uses break points as follows: mic less than  or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefadroxil were determined for 749 defined clinically-significant bacteria isolated in a london teaching hospital and for 63 strains from an international collection of gram-negative bacilli. assuming a breakpoint of 16 mg/l, for the hospital isolates 81.8% of gram-negative bacilli and 83.4% of gram-positive cocci were sensitive. no significant difference between in-patient, out-patient or community-acquired isolates was found. ninety-five and a half per cent of escherichia coli, klebsiella aerogenes (including gentamicin-resistant strains), proteus mirabilis, and (with the exception of streptococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus) all gram-positive cocci were sensitive. of 41 strains of enterobacter spp., were resistant. most indole-positive proteus, and all serratia and acinetobacter spp. were resistant, including 36 additional strains taken from an international collection. of 30 strains of haemophilus influenzae, only six had mics of 16 mg/l or less. for disc susceptibility testing, the standard disc containing 30 micrograms of cefadroxil reliably gave zones of greater than 17 mm  for organisms with mics of less than 16 mg/l. a zone of less than 14 mm corresponded to mics of greater than 64 mg/l. despite a lack of controlled clinical trials, the results of this study (taken with favourable pharmacokinetics) suggest that cefadroxil has potential as an oral cephalosporin  in hospital practice in the u.k.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of diethyldithiocarbamate and dimethyldithiocarbamate against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus has appeared which is highly resistant to both methicillin  and aminoglycosides. current therapy involves long-term intravenous therapy of vancomycin. since vancomycin is currently the only drug used to treat these patients, there is a need to develop additional antimicrobial therapy. the in vitro antimicrobial effect of the metal chelator, diethyldithiocarbamate (ddtc) and its structural analog dimethyldithiocarbamate (dmtc) were investigated. both  ddtc and dmtc were effective against s. aureus including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). by agar diffusion, ddtc at 10 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 12 to 21 mm and at 100 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 26 to  34 mm against mrsa. the dmtc produced slightly greater zone sizes against mrsa of 16 to 24 mm and 24 to 37 mm for 10 micrograms per disk and 100 micrograms per disk, respectively. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for dmtc against mrsa was 6 micrograms per ml. both ddtc and dmtc were also effective against enterococci, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, salmonella species, serratia marcescens and citrobacter freundii at 100 micrograms per disk. the mics of dmtc for klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, salmonella and citrobacter freundii were approximately 128 micrograms per ml while the mics for proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens was greater than or equal to 256 micrograms per ml. in addition, dmtc was synergistic with gentamicin against mrsa and coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. additive and synergistic effects of dmtc were displayed with gentamicin against s. aureus including methicillin-resistant  s. aureus.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == incidence of staphylococcus aureus, coliforms and antibiotic-resistant strains of escherichia coli in rural water supplies in port harcourt.
AB  == the bacteriological quality of some rural water supplies in port harcourt was monitored over a 3 month period. the supplies were unsatisfactory as judged by standard plate counts (10(3)/ml) and the presence of presumptive and faecal coliforms and staphylococcus aureus. the recovery of potentially pathogenic bacteria (e.g. pseudomonas aeruginosa) further substantiated the existence of health hazards. the most frequently isolated coliforms were escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae. coliform contamination was greater in well water than in river or stream water samples. an antibiotic sensitivity test revealed that 17.5-27.2% of e. coli strains were resistant to three or more antibiotics. escherichia coli isolated from well water samples exhibited the greatest degree of multiple resistance. some strains were resistant to all the six antibiotics tested. the danger of an epidemic of waterborne diseases in the communities as a result of drinking water from these non-potable  sources is noted.

AB  == the ftsz (sulb) gene of escherichia coli codes for a 40,000-dalton protein that carries out a key step in the cell division pathway. the presence of an ftsz gene protein in other bacterial species was examined by a combination of southern blot and western blot analyses. southern blot analysis of genomic restriction digests  revealed that many bacteria, including species from six members of the family enterobacteriaceae and from pseudomonas aeruginosa and agrobacterium tumefaciens, contained sequences which hybridized with an e. coli ftsz probe. genomic dna from more distantly related bacteria, including bacillus subtilis, branhamella catarrhalis, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus, did not hybridize under minimally stringent conditions. western blot analysis, with anti-e. coli ftsz antiserum, revealed that all bacterial species examined contained a major immunoreactive band. several of the enterobacteriaceae were transformed with a multicopy plasmid encoding the e. coli ftsz gene. these transformed strains, shigella sonnei, salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter  aerogenes, were shown to overproduce the ftsz protein and to produce minicells. analysis of [35s]methionine-labeled minicells revealed that the plasmid-encoded gene products were the major labeled species. this demonstrated that the e. coli  ftsz gene could function in other bacterial species to induce minicells and that  these minicells could be used to analyze plasmid-endoced gene products.

AB  == solutions of clinifeed iso, triosorbon, vivonex standard (full- and half-strength) and vivonex hn were experimentally contaminated with two strains each of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella aerogenes, escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae at concentrations of 10(2)-10(3) organisms/ml. samples were incubated at 4, 25 or 37 degrees c and viable counts were made at 0, 4, 8 and 24 h. no increase in numbers of any of the organisms was observed in any of the feeds during 24 h at 4 degrees c. all organisms multiplied rapidly in clinifeed iso and in triosorbon at 25 and 37 degrees c. there was less rapid growth in half-strength vivonex standard at 25 degrees c, although at 37 degrees c all strains multiplied rapidly except for the two s. aureus strains, the growth of which was inhibited in half-strength vivonex standard at both 25 and 37 degrees c. in full-strength vivonex standard at 25 degrees c, only p. aeruginosa showed any increase in numbers during 24 h, whereas p. aeruginosa, k.  aerogenes and e. cloacae all multiplied at 37 degrees c. none of the test organisms multiplied in full strength vivonex hn at any of the temperatures studied. the results of the study show that bacteria survive and may multiply even in feeds with low ph and high osmolarity, and emphasise the importance of strict hygiene during the preparation and handling of all enteral feeds.

TI  == efficacy of imipenem/cilastatin in endocarditis.
AB  == imipenem, a potent new beta-lactam antibiotic, which is bactericidal against most pathogenic bacteria, and cilastatin, a dehydropeptidase inhibitor combined with imipenem to prevent the metabolism of imipenem in the kidney, were evaluated in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis. seventeen patients, including 14 who used intravenous drugs, were treated with imipenem/cilastatin in a dose of 500 mg each infused over 30 minutes every six hours. the mean duration of treatment was  29 days with a range of 21 to 56 days. causative bacteria were staphylococcus aureus in 10 patients, s. aureus plus group b streptococcus in one, viridans group streptococcus in two, neisseria subflava, eikenella corrodens, and group g  streptococcus in one patient, and staphylococcus epidermidis, hemophilus aphrophilus, and enterobacter aerogenes in one patient each. the minimal bactericidal concentration of imipenem against 16 of 18 isolates tested was 0.04  micrograms/ml, 1 microgram/ml against h. aphrophilus, and 0.4 micrograms/ml against e. aerogenes. the site of infection was the right side of the heart in 11 patients, the left side in five, and both sides in one. the mean number of days to defervescence was 9.7. all patients were cured, and none required cardiac surgery. adverse effects were few and interrupted treatment occurred in only one  patient who had acute dyspnea during an infusion on day 26 of therapy. imipenem/cilastatin appears to be a relatively safe and highly effective treatment of staphylococcal endocarditis in intravenous drug users; too few patients with endocarditis caused by other bacteria were treated to allow a firm  statement about efficacy in non-staphylococcal endocarditis.

AB  == fk 027 was more active than cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin against stock strains of a wide variety of gram-negative bacteria, including such opportunistic pathogens as citrobacter and enterobacter species and serratia marcescens. fk 027 was significantly more active than the three reference drugs against clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, indole-positive and -negative proteus species, providencia species, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. it was less active than cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin against staphylococci, but it was similar to cefaclor in its activity against streptococci. with few exceptions, fk 027 was active against strains of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis that were resistant to the reference agents. the bactericidal activity of fk 027 against various gram-negative bacteria, including proteus species, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, and s. marcescens, was greater than that of cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin. the therapeutic activities of fk 027 in mice infected with gram-negative bacilli were far superior to the activities of cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin, but they were inferior to the activities of these reference drugs against infection with staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == five cephalosporins: pharmacokinetics and their relation to antibacterial potency.
AB  == in a group of adult volunteers, pharmacokinetic profiles of five cephalosporins were correlated with their minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics90) against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter aerogenes. subjects received the following intravenous regimens in a randomized,  crossover fashion: (1) 0.5 gm, 1 gm, or 2 gm of cefazolin; (2) 2 gm of cephalothin; (3) 1 gm of cephapirin; (4) 1 gm of cefoxitin; or (5) 0.5 gm of cefamandole. the 500-mg dose of cefazolin produced serum concentrations that exceeded those of any of the other cephalosporins at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after administration. the area under the curve for this dose of cefazolin was at  least twice that of any of the other antibiotics. two hours after a 500-mg dose of cefazolin, serum levels exceeded the mic90 for all seven groups of pathogens;  at six hours, the 500-mg dose of cefazolin continued to achieve serum levels above the mic90 against the majority of bacterial groups. in contrast, at two hours after administration none of the other cephalosporins maintained serum levels above the mic90 for all pathogens; at six hours, the levels of cephapirin  were adequate to inhibit the two streptococci, but serum levels of all other cephalosporins were inadequate to inhibit any of the pathogens. these data indicate that a 500-mg dose of cefazolin maintains serum levels above the mics90  longer than any of the other cephalosporins tested and support the use of a 500-mg dose of cefazolin every eight hours for surgical prophylaxis and treatment of most community-acquired infections. such a comparatively low dosage offers substantial savings to both patient and hospital.

AB  == the growth-inhibiting behaviour of abacterial, liquid pure cultures made up of three water algae (hydrodictyon reticulatum, chlorella vulgaris, aphanothece nidulans) which were made to grow profusely in special culture containers under constant exposure to light and ventilation was examined in ten different species  of microorganisms during a period of contact of 4 days both in the light and in the dark. subjected to the test were the 5 pathogenic species staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium and  candida albicans as well the 5 bacterial contamination indicators e. coli (faecal indicator), streptococcus faecalis (enterococci), enterobacter aerogenes ("coliforms"), staphylococcus epidermidis (dermic germ) and bacillus subtilis ("contamination germ"). it was found that --hydrodictyon reticulatum and aphanothece nidulans exert a strong antibacterial effect, while chlorella vulgaris provides no indication of a bacterial growth-inhibiting effect. --this antibiosis is linked with the assimilative activity of the algal cultures, as in  the dark no antibacterial action is discernible --the "antibiotic principle" must be liable to transitory or rapid disintegration because the algal cultures are ineffective in the dark and also culture filtrates of 5-days old algal cultures exercise no growth-inhibiting effect. with respect to the sanitation of waters it is important to state that a profuse growth of algae produces a certain, but hardly reliable "biological water disinfection" and renders difficult the assessment of the quality of a water-course as a result of the elimination of the usual contamination indicators. therefore, additional microbiological quality parameters must be used for assessment of pollution of swimming pools with strong algal growth.

AB  == the in-vitro qualities of ceftazidime, as compared to other beta-lactams and three other antimicrobials (amikacin, gentamicin and chloramphenicol), were evaluated in a multilaboratory, multiphasic study in the united states. a total of 12,986 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference dilution methods in six medical centres over 45-60 days. ceftazidime was superior to the comparison cephalosporin (cefamandole) and comparable in spectrum and activity to gentamicin against enterobacteriaceae. of 8038 enteric bacilli tested, over 98% had ctaz mics < or = 8 mg/l with a mode of < or = 0.12 mg/l. only citrobacter freundii and enterobacter aerogenes had ceftazidime mic(90s) in the resistant range ( > or =32 mg/l). staphylococcus aureus strains were less susceptible to ceftazidime (mode mic 8 mg/l) compared to cefamandole or gentamicin. ceftazidime was more effective than cefamandole or gentamicin against the beta-haemolytic streptococci and the pneumococcus. more than 90% of pseudomonas aeruginosa, most other pseudomonas spp. and acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by ceftazidime at concentrations of 8  mg/l. in other comparative studies ceftazidime was found remarkably similar in spectrum to cefotaxime, cefoperazone and moxalactam against the enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci and streptococcus spp. enterobacter cloacae was the only enteric species having ceftazidime mic90 >8 mg/l. only cefsulodin (mode  mic 2 mg/l) and cefoperazone (mode mic 4 mg/l) shared the ceftazidime activity against ps. aeruginosa. ceftazidime mic(50s) for neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producers) were 0.03-0.06 and 0.015 mg/l, respectively. ceftazidime was found to be bactericidal against most strains at or one doubling dilution above the mic, and was relatively unaffected  by increasing inoculum concentration (some strain variations). it perfused readily into bacterial cells and was effective against the majority of strains resistant to currently available cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. beta-lactamases of types i-v and bacillus cereus failed to significantly hydrolyse ceftazidime. ceftazidime inhibited only type i ent. cloacae beta-lactamase hydrolysis. disc diffusion tests favour the use of a 30 microg ceftazidime disc for the methods described by the national committee clinical laboratory standards (nccls). quality control data are presented. tentative 30 microg disc interpretive criteria, based on susceptible mics of < or =8 mg/l(> 17 mm) and resistant > or =32 mg/l ( < or =13 mm), resulted in < 1% (false resistance or false susceptible) interpretive error rates. staph. aureus was the  species most commonly found to have strains with indeterminate ceftazidime zones  or mics. we found ceftazidime to possess one of the widest clinically usable antimicrobial spectrum by in-vitro testing of any beta-lactam tested and to be most comparable to broad-spectrum aminoglycosides such as amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin.

AB  == the in vitro activity of ceftizoxime was compared with that of other beta-lactam  antibiotics against 538 isolates. ceftizoxime was the most active agent tested against escherichia coli and klebsiella, inhibiting 80% at 0.025 microgram/ml. it was more active than cefotaxime against enterobacter cloacae and e. aerogenes. ceftizoxime was more active than cefoxitin, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, and carbenicillin against proteus mirabilis and indole-positive proteus. it inhibited 97% of multiresistant serratia isolates at 12.5 microgram/ml, whereas cefotaxime  inhibited only 19%. ceftizoxime was less active than cefotaxime and cefoperazone  against pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was more active than carbenicillin. it was more active than cefotaxime and cefoxitin against bacteroides. it was not appreciably destroyed by beta-lactamases of staphylococcus aureus, enterobacteriaceae, or pseudomonas.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of heparin.
AB  == single clinical isolates of eight species of microorganisms were incubated in solutions of heparin and brain heart infusion broth at various concentrations to  determine the possible antibacterial effect of heparin. at heparin concentrations ranging from 12.5 to 400 u/ml, the effect on escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis varied with brain heart infusion broth concentrations of 1.2 to 10% and inocula of 10(2) to 10(6) colony-forming units per ml; similar effects were not observed with klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and citrobacter spp. the minimal inhibitory concentrations of heparin for ten strains of each species were determined in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth with inocula of 10(4) colony-forming units per ml. all 10 isolates of s. aureus and all 10 of s. epidermidis were inhibited by heparin concentrations of 125 to 500 u/ml. three e. coli, four p. aeruginosa, and nine c. albicans strains were inhibited by </=500 u of heparin per ml. none of the k. pneumoniae, e. aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, and citrobacter spp. was inhibited by heparin at </=500 u/ml. heparin inhibition  of s. aureus in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth-500 u of heparin per ml could be  quantitatively overcome by addition of magnesium, calcium, or magnesium and calcium. these data suggest that the growth of microorganisms from heparin-containing material may be suppressed.

TI  == effect of ph on the antimicrobial activity of some triphenylmethane dyes.
AB  == four common dyes were tested as inhibitors of four types of bacteria over the ph  range 5.0-9.0. inhibition of the gram-negative types, salmonella anatum and enterobacter aerogenes, was markedly affected by the ph of the medium. these organisms tolerated concentrations of crystal violet and ethyl violet about 100-fold higher at ph 5.0 than at ph 9.0. above ph 7.0 brilliant green (bg) and malachite green (mg) were precipitated as their respective carbinols and lost their inhibitory properties with these two organisms. two gram-positive types, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus, were more sensitive to dyes and results were less affected by ph. the carbinol forms of mg and bg were nearly as  inhibitory to these organisms as the ionized forms.

TI  == bacterial 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenases.
AB  == enterobacter aerogenes, aeromonas hydrophila, serratia marcescens and staphylococcus aureus possessing l(+)-butanediol dehydrogenase produced mainly meso-butanediol and small amounts of optically active butanediol; acetobacter suboxydans, bacillus polymyxa and erwinia carotovora containing d(-)-butanediol dehydrogenase produced more optically active butanediol than meso-butanediol. resting and growing cells of these organisms oxidezed only one enantiomer of racemic butanediol. the d(-)-butanediol dehydrogenase from bacillus polymyxa was  partially purified (30-fold) with a specific activity of 24.5. except nad and nadh no other cofactors were required. optimum ph-values for oxidation and reduction were ph 9 and ph 7, respectively. the optimum temperature was about 60  degrees c. the molecular weight was 100000 to 107000. the km-values were 3.3 mm for d(-)butanediol, 6.25 mm for meso-butanediol, 0.53 mm for acetoin, 0.2 mm for  nad, 0.1 mm for nadh, 87 mm for diacetyl, 38 mm for 1,2-propanediol; 2,3-pentanedion was not a substrate for this enzyme. the l(+)butanediol dehydrogenase from serratia marcescens was purified 57-fold (specific activity 22.3). besides nad or nadh no cofactors were required. the optimum value for oxidation was about ph9 and for reduction ph 4.5. the optimum temperature was 32-36 degrees c. the molecular weight was 100000 to 107000. the km-values were 5  mm for meso-butanediol, 10 mm for racemic butanediol, 6.45 for acetoin, 1 mm for  nad, 0.25 mm for nadh, 2.08 mm for diacetyl, 16.7 mm for 2,3-pentanedion and 11.8 mm for 1,2-propanediol.

TI  == clavulanic acid: a beta-lactamase-inhiting beta-lactam from streptomyces clavuligerus.
AB  == a novel beta-lactamase inhibitor has been isolated from streptomyces clavuligerus atcc 27064 and given the name clavulanic acid. conditions for the cultivation of  the organism and detection and isolation of clavulanic acid are described. this compound resembles the nucleus of a penicillin but differs in having no acylamino side chain, having oxygen instead of sulfur, and containing a beta-hydroxyethylidine substituent in the oxazolidine ring. clavulanic acid is a  potent inhibitor of many beta-lactamases, including those found in escherichia coli (plasmid mediated), klebsiella aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus, the inhibition being of a progressive type. the cephalosporinase type of beta-lactamase found in pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae p99 and the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of e. coli are less well inhibited. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin and  cephaloridine against beta-lactamase-producing, penicillin-resistant strains of s. aureus, k. aerogenes, p. mirabilis, and e. coli have been shown to be considerably reduced by the addition of low concentrations of clavulanic acid.

AB  == in this study the author reported upon a practical new system for screening and identifying the microbial agents causing urinary tract infections. this system is composed of a combination of 3 screening procedures (ph-value + nitrite-test + catalase-test) and 8 selective culture media for the purpose of genus identification within 24 hours (uripret-g). a total of 130 cultures was investigated. the employed microorganisms were mainly recovered from urine samples. they included the following species: candida albicans, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus inconstans, proteus mirabilis, proteus morganii, proteus rettgeri, proteus vulgaris, serratia liquefaciens, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus faecium. employing coded cultures not only monoinfections but also multiinfections in urine samples were simulated. under the circumstances of investigation it was possible with the help of the new system to reidentify the genera of all but two of the 130 employed microorganisms.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of cefoxitin and cefamandole.
AB  == cefoxitin and cefamandole were evaluated in vitro against 263 organisms. studies  were performed in mueller-hinton and nutrient broth and agar employing inoculum sizes of 10(6) and 10(8) organisms per ml. at obtainable serum levels both antibiotics were bactericidal for nearly all strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus but were inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus. in agar, cefamandole appeared to be active against most strains of enterobacter and indole-positive proteus, whereas cefoxitin was active against indole-positive proteus but not enterobacter. moreover, in broth medium most strains of enterobacter were not readily inhibited by either antibiotic and only 40 and 73% of indole-positive proteus were inhibited by 10 mug of cefamandole per ml in mueller-hinton and nutrient broth, respectively. however, in both broth media, 10 mug of cefoxitin per ml continued to be inhibitory and bactericidal for most isolates of indole-positive proteus. cefoxitin also was bactericidal against four cephalothin-resistant strains of e. coli. these data suggest that cefoxitin broadens the spectrum of existing cephalosporins by enhancing the activity against indole-positive proteus species as well as some other enterobacteriaceae. on the other hand, with the exception of strains of enterobacter aerogenes, the apparent increased in vitro activity of cefamandole was demonstrated in agar and  not in broth.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of gentamicin, judged by m.i.c. determinations, was much reduced when a normal aerobic atmosphere was replaced either by air +4% co2 or by anaerobic conditions. the phenomenon was greatest for staphylococcus aureus, where a decrease in activity of up to 20-fold was found. for escherichia coli, klebsiella aerogenes, enterobacter spp., and proteus spp. the factor of decrease  was between 15-fold and 2-5-fold. changes in medium ph, as a result of bacterial  growth, can explain these findings for some, but not all, the species tested.

AB  == the effects of ad lib use of an antibacterial soap containing 1.0% trichlorocarbanilide and 0.5% trifluoromethyldichlorocarbanilide on the bacterial flora of six skin sites of 132 subjects were measured by comparison with the flora of 93 control subjects who avoided the use of topical antibacterials. each  subject was examined once. the test soap produced significant reductions in geometric mean counts of the total aerobic flora on the back, chest, forearm, calf, and foot; counts were also reduced in the axilla, but not to a significant  extent. the overall reduction by the test soap on all sites was 62% (p less than  0.001). neither age nor sex influenced the effect of the soap on the flora. the antibacterial soap also reduced the prevalence of staphylococcus aureus on the skin, mostly by virtually eliminating it from areas other than the axilla. partial inhibition of the gram-positive flora was not accompanied by an increase  in gram-negative species. the latter were found principally in the axilla; klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes were the species most frequently found.

AB  == the in vitro activity of cefamandole, 7-d-mandelamido-3-(1 methyl-1h-tetrazol-5 yethiomethyl)-3-cephem-4 carboxylic acid, was investigated. the majority of streptococci and pneumococci were inhibited by 0.1 mug/ml. activity against staphylococcus aureus was below that of cephalothin, but most strains were inhibited by 0.4 mug/ml. enterococci were not inhibited by less than 25 mug/ml. cefamandole was very active against most members of the enterobacteriaceae, with  70% of escherichia coli, 86% of klebsiella pneumoniae, and 88% of proteus mirabilis inhibited by 1.6 mug/ml. a number of enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens strains were inhibited by less than 25 mug/ml.  pseudomonas species were resistant. cefamandole was more active than cephalothin, cephaloridine, or cephalexin against members of the enterobacteriaceae. inoculum  size and type of medium had variable effects on the minimal inhibitory concentration, depending upon the particular strain tested. strains of enterobacter, serratia, indole-positive proteus species showed the greatest inoculum effect. similarly, these species showed a several-fold difference of bactericidal and inhibitory levels. resistance of cefamandole to hydrolysis by gram-negative beta-lactamase played a partial role in its activity, but some strains that hydrolyzed the agent were susceptible.

AB  == butirosin is a new aminoglycosidic antibiotic complex which has broad gram-negative and gram-positive inhibitory antibacterial activity, as well as some bactericidal properties. significantly susceptible bacteria include strains  of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, and pathogenic gram-negative species such as enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae,  proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris, salmonella enteritidis and s. typhimurium, shigella flexneri and s. sonnei. good activity by parenteral dosing was obtained  in various acute mouse infections. butirosin is especially interesting because of its activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro, including gentamicin-resistant clinical isolates, and in experimental mouse infections at relatively low doses.

TI  == serum bacteriostasis of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == serum bacteriostasis of staphylococcus aureus was characterized quantitatively and quantitatively. bacteriostasis was proportional to the concentration of serum. reproducibility was good; freezing and thawing did not materially affect the end point. four of six different strains, including the propagating s. aureus strain for phage 73 which does not produce coagulase, were susceptible to serum bacteriostasis in similar titers; two were not susceptible at all. all six strains were effective inhibitors of bacteriostasis. active and inactive coagulase were also inhibitors. in contrast to sensitive s. aureus, s. epidermidis and streptococcus salivarius were not uniformly susceptible to bacteriostasis by different serums. escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella montevideo, s. zymogenes, and diplococcus pneumoniae were not susceptible. among gram-positive bacteria, only d. pneumoniae inhibited s. aureus bacteriostasis. agglutinins of s. aureus and nonspecific substances such as lysozyme, beta-lysin, c-reactive protein, and transferrin were not responsible for s. aureus serum bacteriostasis. after diethylaminoethyl column fractionation of serum, the bacteriostatic principle was eluted in proximity to blood group antibody; immunoglobulins a, g, and m appeared to be present in bacteriostatic fractions. it is suggested that s. aureus bacteriostasis by serum is due to natural antibody and that inhibitory reactions  with pneumococci and coagulase are due to common antigens.

TI  == effect of coliform and proteus bacteria on growth of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == cultures of coliform and proteus bacteria, mostly from foods, were tested for their effect on growth of staphylococcus aureus in trypticase soy broth. inhibition of the staphylococcus by these competitors increased with increasing proportions of inhibiting (effector) bacteria in the inoculum and decreasing incubation temperatures (37 to 10 c). time required for 2 x 10(4) staphylococci to increase to 5 x 10(6) cells per milliliter, the minimal number assumed to be necessary for food poisoning, varied with the species of effector, the original ratio of effector bacteria to staphylococci in the medium, and the incubation temperature. when the original ratio was 100:1, the staphylococci did not reach 5 x 10(6) cells per milliliter at 10, 15, 22, or 30 c (with one exception), when growing with cultures representing six species of coliform bacteria and two of proteus. when the ratio was 1:1, all effectors either greatly delayed the staphylococcus or prevented it from reaching hazardous numbers at 15 c, six of the eight caused a delay of 2 to 3 hr at 22 c, and only escherichia coli delayed  the coccus at 30 c. all effectors were ineffective at 22 and 30 c when original numbers of effectors and staphylococci were in the ratio 1:100. greatest overall  inhibition was by e. coli, e. freundii, and proteus vulgaris, and these species were more effective than the others at 22 and 30 c. aerobacter cloacae and paracolobactrum aerogenoides were more effective at 15 c. in general, results were similar with different strains of a species. except for aerobacter aerogenes, klebsiella sp., and p. aerogenoides, which apparently did not compete  for nutrients, inhibition of the staphylococcus was by a combination of antibiotic substances and competition for nutrients.
