TI  == the activity of p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate against neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus ducreyi, and other microorganisms.
AB  == p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate was isolated from lepidium bonariense and found to  be responsible for the plants antimicrobial and std activity. mic determinations  were conducted for p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate on haemophilus ducreyi, neisseria gonorrheae, candida albicans, bacillus subtilus, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter sp., escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and psuedomanas aeruginosa. an in vitro cellular toxicity assay showed that at 100 microm (17,9 microg/ml) p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate is not toxic to living  cells.

TI  == rifampin, a useful drug for nonmycobacterial infections.
AB  == rifampin has clinical efficacy against a wide variety of organisms, including staphylococcus aureus, legionella pneumophila, group a streptococcus, brucella sp, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis, as well as in vitro activity against penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, haemophilus ducreyi, and many gram-negative rods. rifampin is a useful drug for several types of bacterial infections because of its broad spectrum of activity, excellent tissue penetration, and low side effect profile. in combination with other antibiotics, it may be effective when conventional therapies are not.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of quinolones.
AB  == the quinolones are new antimicrobial agents that are descendants of nalidixic acid. as a new class of synthetic antimicrobials they exhibit a wide spectrum of  activity. newer quinolones such as ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, enoxacin, and pefloxacin are highly active against gram negative bacilli of the enterobacteriaceae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus ducreyi. they exhibit less activity against pseudomonas sp. and staphylococcus sp., and little in vitro activity against streptococcus pneumoniae or enterococci. their activity against mycobacterium sp. is variable, and obligate anaerobes are usually considered resistant. of the quinolones reviewed, ciprofloxacin displays the highest degree of in vitro activity.
