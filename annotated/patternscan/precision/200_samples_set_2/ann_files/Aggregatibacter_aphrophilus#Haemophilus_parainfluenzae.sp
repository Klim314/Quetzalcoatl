TI  == association between hacek bacteraemia and endocarditis.
AB  == we retrospectively examined medical records of 87 patients with bacteraemia caused by members of the hacek group (haemophilus parainfluenzae, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, aggregatibacter aphrophilus, aggregatibacter paraphrophilus, cardiobacterium spp., eikenella corrodens and kingella spp.) to determine whether endocarditis was present, as defined by the duke criteria. the  overall positive predictive value (ppv) of hacek bacteraemia for endocarditis was 60 %. the ppv varied with different hacek species from 0 % (e. corrodens) to 100  % (a. actinomycetemcomitans).

TI  == kingella kingae endocarditis: a rare case of mitral valve perforation.
AB  == kingella kingae, a hacek (haemophilus parainfluenzae, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, aggregatibacter aphrophilus, cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens, kingella kingae) organism, is a common resident of the upper airway in children; it has been associated with endocarditis in children with pre-existing heart conditions. this case report describes k. kingae endocarditis  leading to valvular damage in a previously healthy 18-month-old child. our patient developed a k. kingae bacteremia that was later complicated by meningitis, septic embolic stroke, and endocarditis of the mitral valve, leading  to perforation of the posterolateral leaflet. the patient was initially treated conservatively with cefotaxime but, subsequently, required a mitral valve repair  with a pericardial patch and annuloplasty. this report draws attention to the need for clinicians to be aware of the potentially serious complications of k. kingae infection in young children. if k. kingae infection is suspected then therapy should be initiated promptly with a beta-lactam, followed by early echocardiographic assessment. this case also highlights the lack of specific guidelines available for k. kingae endocarditis.

TI  == identification of hacek clinical isolates by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry is a rapid and accurate tool for the identification of many microorganisms. we assessed this technology for the identification of 103 haemophilus parainfluenzae, aggregatibacter aphrophilus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens, and kingella kingae (hacek) clinical isolates and 20 haemophilus influenzae clinical isolates. ninety-three percent of hacek organisms were identified correctly to the genus level using the bruker database, and 100% were identified to the genus level using a custom database that included clinical isolates.

TI  == electron microscopy of phages in serotypes of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinobacillus ureae, haemophilus aphrophilus, haemophilus paraphrophilus, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, pasteurella haemolytica and pasteurella multocida strains were examined by transmission electron microscopy for the presence of bacteriophages.  phages were detected in serotype a (suny 75) and e (uoh 1705) and in the fresh clinical isolates uoh q1243 and uoh q1247 of a. actinomycetemcomitans. phages were not found in serotype b, c and d strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans, in the fresh clinical isolate uoh q1244 of this species or in old strains (including reference strains) of related species from the actinobacillus-haemophilus-pasteurella group.
