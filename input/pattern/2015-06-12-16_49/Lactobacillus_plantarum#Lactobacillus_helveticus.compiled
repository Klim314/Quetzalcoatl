TI  - Antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 Lactobacillus and three Bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. Agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (pH 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; CFS) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; CFW) from de Man-Rogosa-Sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. Acid CFS and CFW showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against C. albicans. Neutralized CFS/CFW assays showed six strains active against S. aureus (L. acidophilus L-1, L. brevis 1, L. fermentum 1, B. animalis subsp. lactis L-3), E. coli (L. bulgaricus 6) or B. cereus (L. plantarum 24-4capital VE, Cyrillic). Inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized CFS (L. bulgaricus 6, L. helveticus 3, L. plantarum 24-2L, L. fermentum 1)/CFW (L. plantarum 24-5D, L. plantarum 24-4capital VE, Cyrillic) was detected. Some strains maintained activity after pH neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. The antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the Epsilometer test method. All strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. Four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (L. rhamnosus Lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (L. acidophilus L-1 and L. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; L. casei L-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). Vancomycin MICs > 256 mug/mL indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. The antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.
TI  - characterization of the adhesive factors of selected probiotics to Caco-2 epithelium cell line.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to analyse the type of adhesive factors of selected probiotic strains. A large number of lactic acid bacteria with intestinal and dairy origin were collected and assessed for adhesion on Caco-2 cell line. From the best adherent bacteria, four strains were selected for further research: Lactobacillus gasseri G7, L. plantarum F1, L. helveticus AC and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus B14. The average number of adhered bacteria was 17 per one Caco-2 cell in the case of L. gasseri G7 and 21 per cell in the case of L. plantarum F1. Treatment with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), trypsin and metaperiodic acid in separate assays revealed that cell-bonded extracellular proteins were responsible for the adhesion of the selected L. gasseri, L. plantarum and L. helveticus strains, in contrast to the L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strain, whose adhesive factors were identified as cell-bonded exopolysaccharides. The cell-wall proteins from the first three strains were isolated, fractionated and assessed for adhesion to Caco-2 cells. Based on the attachment properties of the purified proteins towards Caco-2 cells, it was clearly proved exactly which proteins are involved in the adherence. L. plantarum F1 strain contains two adhesive proteins in contrast to the other selected strains containing one adhesive protein each. The determination of the factors mediating the adhesive abilities of the selected strains provides important information about the possible ways to preserve and increase adhesive properties towards epithelium cells.
TI  - Molecular identification and quantification of lactic acid bacteria in traditional fermented dairy foods of Russia.
AB  - Russian traditional fermented dairy foods have been consumed for thousands of years. However, little research has focused on exploiting lactic acid bacteria (LAB) resources and analyzing the LAB composition of Russian traditional fermented dairy foods. In the present study, we cultured LAB isolated from fermented mare and cow milks, sour cream, and cheese collected from Kalmykiya, Buryats, and Tuva regions of Russia. Seven lactobacillus species and the Bifidobacterium genus were quantified by quantitative PCR. The LAB counts in these samples ranged from 3.18 to 9.77 log cfu/mL (or per gram). In total, 599 LAB strains were obtained from these samples using de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe agar and M17 agar. The identified LAB belonged to 7 genera and 30 species by 16S rRNA and murE gene sequencing and multiplex PCR assay. The predominant LAB isolates were Lactobacillus helveticus (176 strains) and Lactobacillus plantarum (63 strains), which represented 39.9% of all isolates. The quantitative PCR results revealed that counts of 7 lactobacilli species and Bifidobacterium spp. of 30 fermented cow milk samples ranged from 1.19 +/- 0.34 (Lactobacillus helveticus in Tuva) to 8.09 +/- 0.71 (Lactobacillus acidophilus in Kalmykiya) log cfu/mL of fermented cow milk (mean +/- standard error). The numbers of Bifidobacterium spp., Lb. plantarum, Lb. helveticus, and Lb. acidophilus revealed no significant difference between the 3 regions; nevertheless, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus sakei, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus exhibited different degrees of variation across 3 regions. The results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of Russia have complex compositions of LAB species. The diversity of LAB might be related to the type of fermented dairy product, geographical origin, and manufacturing process.
TI  - Enrichment of ACE inhibitory peptides in navy bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) using lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The present study was conducted to explore a novel strategy to enhance angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activities of navy bean by preparation of navy bean milk (NBM) which was then subjected to fermentation of four lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains, namely, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus helveticus MB2-1, Lactobacillus plantarum B1-6, and Lactobacillus plantarum 70810. With the exception of L. helveticus MB2-1, the other three selected strains had good growth performances in NBM with viable counts increased to log 8.30-8.39 cfu ml(-1) during 6 h of fermentation, and thus were selected for the following investigations. Protein contents of NBM significantly reduced when treated with L. bulgaricus and L. plantarum B1-6, and the electrophoresis patterns showed the preferable proteins for LAB strains to hydrolyze were alpha- and beta-type phaseolins, whereas gamma-type phaseolin was resistant to hydrolysis. RP-HPLC analysis demonstrated all fermented NBM had higher intensities of peaks with retention times between 2.5 and 3.5 min indicative of formation of small peptides. All fermented NBM showed higher ACE inhibitory activity compared to the unfermented ones, for which 2 h, 3 h, and 5 h were found to be the optimum fermentation periods for respectively L. plantarum 70810, L. plantarum B1-6 and L. bulgaricus, with IC50 values of 109 +/- 5.1, 108 +/- 1.1, and 101 +/- 2.2 mug protein ml(-1). The subsequent in vitro gastrointestinal simulation afforded all fermented extracts reduced IC50 values and the extracts fermented by L. plantarum B1-6 exerted the lowest IC50 value of 21 +/- 2.1 mug protein ml(-1). The research has broadened our knowledge bases on the effect of LAB fermentation on the degradation of navy bean proteins and the capacity to release ACE inhibitory peptides. The approach was promising to obtain probiotic products with potential to serve as functional ingredients targeting hypertension.
TI  - Naturally occurring lactic Acid bacteria isolated from tomato pomace silage.
AB  - Silage making has become a significant method of forage conservation worldwide. To determine how tomato pomace (TP) may be used effectively as animal feed, it was ensilaged for 90 days and microbiology counts, fermentation characteristics and chemical composition of tomato pomace silage (TPS) were evaluated at the 30th, 60th, and 90th days, respectively. In addition, 103 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from TPS. Based on the phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, 16S rDNA sequence and carbohydrate fermentation tests, the isolates were identified as 17 species namely: Lactobacillus coryniformis subsp. torquens (0.97%), Lactobacillus pontis (0.97%), Lactobacillus hilgardii (0.97%), Lactobacillus pantheris (0.97%), Lactobacillus amylovorus (1.9%), Lactobacillus panis (1.9%), Lactobacillus vaginalis (1.9%), Lactobacillus rapi (1.9%), Lactobacillus buchneri (2.9%), Lactobacillus parafarraginis (2.9%), Lactobacillus helveticus (3.9%), Lactobacillus camelliae (3.9%), Lactobacillus fermentum (5.8%), Lactobacillus manihotivorans (6.8%), Lactobacillus plantarum (10.7%), Lactobacillus harbinensis (16.5%) and Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (35.0%). This study has shown that TP can be well preserved for 90 days by ensilaging and that TPS is not only rich in essential nutrients, but that physiological and biochemical properties of the isolates could provide a platform for future design of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) inoculants aimed at improving the fermentation quality of silage.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal Travnik young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks over four seasons.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the composition of lactic acid bacteria  (LAB) in autochthonous young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks produced in the Vlasic mountain region of central Bosnia and Herzegovina near the town of Travnik over a four season period. These three products were made from cow's milk by a traditional method without the addition of a starter culture. Preliminary characterization with phenotype-based assays and identification using rep-PCR with a (GTG)5 primer and 16S rDNA sequence analysis were undertaken for 460 LAB isolates obtained from all the examined samples. Fifteen species were identified as follows: Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Lactococcus garviae, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus helveticus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus italicus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Leuconostoc lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus mitis. A wide genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity of the species was observed, particularly within the Lc. lactis strains. In all of the tested dairy products across four seasons, a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.690) between the presence of lactococci and enterococci and a negative correlation (r = 0.722) between the presence of lactococci and leuconostocs were recorded. Forty-five percent of the lactobacilli and 54.4% of the lactococci exhibited proteolytic activity, whereas 18.7% of the total LAB isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Growth, survival, and peptidolytic activity of Lactobacillus plantarum I91 in a hard-cheese model.
AB  - In this work, we studied the growth, survival, and peptidolytic activity of Lactobacillus plantarum I91 in a hard-cheese model consisting of a sterile extract of Reggianito cheese. To assess the influence of the primary starter and initial proteolysis level on these parameters, we prepared the extracts with cheeses that were produced using 2 different starter strains of Lactobacillus helveticus 138 or 209 (Lh138 or Lh209) at 3 ripening times: 3, 90, and 180 d. The experimental extracts were inoculated with Lb. plantarum I91; the control extracts were not inoculated and the blank extracts were heat-treated to inactivate enzymes and were not inoculated. All extracts were incubated at 34 degrees C for 21 d, and then the pH, microbiological counts, and proteolysis profiles were determined. The basal proteolysis profiles in the extracts of young cheeses made with either strain tested were similar, but many differences between the proteolysis profiles of the extracts of the Lh138 and Lh209 cheeses were found when riper cheeses were used. The pH values in the blank and control extracts did not change, and no microbial growth was detected. In contrast, the pH value in experimental extracts decreased, and this decrease was more pronounced in extracts obtained from either of the young cheeses and from the Lh209 cheese at any stage of ripening. Lactobacillus plantarum I91 grew up to 8 log during the first days of incubation in all of the extracts, but then the number of viable cells decreased, the extent of which depended on the starter strain and the age of the cheese used for the extract. The decrease in the counts of Lb. plantarum I91 was observed mainly in the extracts in which the pH had diminished the most. In addition, the extracts that best supported the viability of Lb. plantarum I91 during incubation had the highest free amino acids content. The effect of Lb. plantarum I91 on the proteolysis profile of the extracts was marginal. Significant changes in the content of free amino acids suggested that the catabolism of free amino acids by Lb. plantarum I91 prevailed in a weakly proteolyzed medium, whereas the release of amino acids due to peptidolysis overcame their catabolism in a medium with high levels of free amino acids. Lactobacillus plantarum I91 was able to use energy sources other than lactose to support its growth because equivalent numbers of cells were observed in extracts containing residual amounts of lactose and in lactose-depleted extracts. The contribution of Lb. plantarum I91 to hard-cooked cheese peptidolysis was negligible compared with that of the starter strain; however, its ability to transform amino acids is a promising feature of this strain.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of probiotic properties of Lactobacilli isolated from rat fecal microbiota.
AB  - The objective of the present study was to characterize lactobacilli isolates from the feces of male Wistar rats. Various physiological features of the candidate probiotic isolates were preliminarily investigated, including tolerance to simulated gastric juice and bile salts, antimicrobial activity, antibiotic susceptibility and in vitro aggregation. Based on their morphological and biochemical characteristics, four potential probiotic isolates (CS2, CS3, CS4, and CS7) were screened. The isolates showed good tolerance to stimulated gastric juice and bile salts. CS4 and CS7 exhibited strong antibacterial activities against the pathogens tested as assessed in neutral pH culture supernatants. All lactobacilli isolates were susceptible to all the tested antibiotics, except vancomycin. Moreover, the isolate CS4 and CS7 were found to possess stronger cell surface traits such as hydrophobicity, auto-aggregation and co-aggregation capacity. In addition, CS4 and CS7 had greater beta-galactosidase activities than the others. Biochemical tests and 16S rRNA gene sequencing confirmed that CS2, CS3, CS4 and CS7 are Lactobacillus intestinalis PJ2, L. sakei PJ3, L. helveticus PJ4, and L. plantarum PJ7, respectively. Based on the obtained results, L. helveticus PJ4 and L. plantarum PJ7 are ideal in vitro probiotic candidates and require further in vivo evaluation.
TI  - Evaluation of the microbial community, acidity and proximate composition of akamu, a fermented maize food.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Akamu is a lactic acid-fermented cereal-based food that constitutes a major infant complementary food in most West African countries. The identities of LAB populations from DGGE analysis and conventionally isolated LAB and yeasts from traditionally fermented akamu were confirmed by PCR sequencing analysis. The relationships between pH, acidity and lactic acid levels and proximate composition of the akamu samples were investigated. RESULTS: The LAB communities in the akamu samples comprised mainly Lactobacillus species, including Lb. fermentum, Lb. plantarum, Lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Lb. helveticus, as well as Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris. Identified yeasts were Candida tropicalis, Candida albicans, Clavispora lusitaniae and Saccharomyces paradoxus. Low pH (3.22-3.95) was accompanied by high lactic acid concentrations (43.10-84.29 mmol kg(-)(1)). Protein (31.88-74.32 g kg(-)(1)) and lipid (17.74-36.83 g kg(-)(1) contents were negatively correlated with carbohydrate content (897.48-926.20 g kg(-)(1), of which </=1 g kg(-)(1) was sugars). Ash was either not detected or present only in trace amounts (</=4 g kg(-)(1)). Energy levels ranged from 17.29 to 18.37 kJ g(-)(1). CONCLUSION: The akamu samples were predominantly starchy foods and had pH < 4.0 owing to the activities of fermentative LAB.
TI  - Taxonomic and molecular characterization of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in nunu, a Ghanaian fermented milk product.
AB  - Produced from raw unpasteurized milk, nunu is a spontaneously fermented yoghurt-like product made in Ghana and other parts of West Africa. Despite the importance of nunu in the diet of many Africans, there is currently only limited information available on the microorganisms associated with nunu processing. With the aim of obtaining a deeper understanding of the process and as a first step towards developing starter cultures with desired technological properties for nunu production, a microbiological characterization of nunu processing in three different towns in the Upper East region of Ghana, namely Bolgatanga, Paga and Navrongo, was carried out. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeasts associated with nunu processing were isolated and identified using a combination of pheno- and genotypic methods including morphological and carbohydrate fermentation tests, (GTG)5-based rep-PCR, multiplex PCR, and 16S and 26S rRNA gene sequencing. The LAB counts during nunu processing increased from 4.5 +/- 0.4 log cfu/ml at 0 h to 8.7 +/- 1.8 log cfu/ml at 24 h of fermentation while yeasts counts increased from 2.8 +/- 1.2 log cfu/ml at 0 h to 5.8 +/- 0.5 log cfu/ml by the end of fermentation. Lactobacillus fermentum was the dominant LAB throughout the fermentations with Lactobacillus plantarum and Leuconostoc mesenteroides playing prominent roles during the first 6-8 h of fermentation as well. Less frequently isolated LAB included Lactobacillus helveticus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus italicus, Weissella confusa and a putatively novel Lactococcus spp. The yeasts involved were identified as Candida parapsilosis, Candida rugosa, Candida tropicalis, Galactomyces geotrichum, Pichia kudriavzevii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae with P. kudriavzevii and S. cerevisiae being the dominant yeast species.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of microflora from ovine cheese.
AB  - Strains identified in ovine cheese and bryndza by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis belonged to ten species of non-enterococcal lactic acid bacteria and included Lactobacillus casei/Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactococcus lactis, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Pediococcus acidilactici. The susceptibility toward antibiotics was determined in lactobacilli, lactococci and pediococci and also in Escherichia coli for comparison. Analysis of L. fermentum and pediococci revealed the presence of non-wild-type epidemiological cut-offs in streptomycin, clindamycin or gentamicin. E. coli were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin and florfenicol. No extended spectrum beta-lactamases were detected.
TI  - The investigation of probiotic potential of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional Mongolian dairy products.
AB  - The aims of this study were to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  (LAB) isolated from traditional Mongolian dairy products, and to estimate the probiotic potential of the isolated strains. We collected 66 samples of the traditional Mongolian dairy products tarag (n = 45), airag (n = 7), aaruul (n = 8), byasulag (n = 1) and eezgii (n = 5), from which 543 LAB strains were isolated and identified based on 16S ribosomal DNA sequence. The predominant species of those products were Lactobacillus (L.) delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, L. helveticus, L. fermentum, L. delbrueckii ssp. lactis and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. However, we could not detect any LAB strains from eezgii. All LAB isolates were screened for tolerance to low pH and to bile acid, gas production from glucose, and adherence to Caco-2 cells. In vitro, we found 10 strains possess probiotic properties, and almost identified them as L. plantarum or L. paracasei subspecies, based on 16S ribosomal DNA and carbohydrate fermentation pattern. These strains were differentiated from each other individually by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis. Additionally, it was notable that 6/10 strains were isolated from camel milk tarag from the Dornogovi province.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in Mongolia.
AB  - Spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in Mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. The objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in Mongolia. The LAB counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/mL. Fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of LAB, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. In total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe agar and M17 agar. Each isolate was considered to be presumptive LAB based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, multiplex PCR assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. All isolates from Mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as Enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), Enterococcus durans (3 strains), Lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), Lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), Lactobacillus casei (16 strains), Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), Lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), Lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), Lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), Lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), Lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), Leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), Leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), Streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and Weissella cibaria (1 strain). The predominant LAB were Strep. thermophilus and Lb. helveticus, which were isolated from all sampling sites. The results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of Mongolia have complex compositions of LAB species. Such diversity of LAB provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.
TI  - [Genetic diversity of the genus Lactobacillus bacteria from the human gastrointestinal microbiome].
AB  - The species and strain genetic diversity of bacterial cultures belonging to the genus Lactobacillus, which were isolated from the gastrointestinal microbiome of the human population living in the former Soviet Union in the years 1960-1980, was studied. The bacteria demonstrated probiotic characteristics. Phylogenetic analysis of sequences of the gene coding for 16S rRNA detected earlier by us, showed that the gene found in bacteria isolated from the intestinal content of healthy adults and represented by species L. plantarum, L. helveticus, L. casei/paracasei, L. rhamnosus, and L. fermentum has high homology (97-100%) with this gene in type representatives of the species. The genotypic and strain diversity of cultures was studied using RAPD-PCR and nonspecific primers. This method with the use of the ERIC-1 primer gave reliable and reproducible results as compared that using with M13 and MSP primers and allowed the identification of examined bacteria belonging to the genus Lactobacillus at the level of species and certification at the strain level.
TI  - Diversity and metabolic impact of intestinal Lactobacillus species in healthy adults and the elderly.
AB  - The present study aimed at assessing the counts and species distribution of intestinal lactobacilli and exploring if the data are associated with BMI and blood glucose level in healthy adults and elderly persons. The BMI (P < 0.01), the level of fasting blood glucose (P < 0.001) and the total counts of lactobacilli (P < 0.01 by bacteriology; P < 0.001 by real-time PCR) were higher in the elderly. The number of species in adults was lower (P < 0.05), who were more often colonised with Lactobacillus acidophilus (P = 0.031) and L. helveticus (P < 0.001). In contrast, L. plantarum (P = 0.035), L. paracasei (P < 0.001) and L. reuteri (P = 0.031) were more prevalent in the elderly. L. rhamnosus was detected in adults (P < 0.001), but not in any elderly person. BMI was associated with counts of lactobacilli, adjusted for age and sex (P = 0.008). The higher BMI in both groups of persons was associated with the presence of obligate homofermentative lactobacilli and L. sakei, both adjusted for age and sex. Plasma glucose values were positively correlated with BMI and negatively correlated with colonisation with L. paracasei (P = 0.0238) in adults and on the borderline with L. fermentum (P = 0.052) in the elderly. Thus, the species-specific PCR analysis of Lactobacillus sp. combined with viable plating data indicates substantial age-related structural differences in the intestinal lactobacilli communities. The higher counts of intestinal Lactobacillus sp. are associated with higher BMI and blood glucose content, while their specific fermentative groups and species of lactobacilli appear at different glucose levels both in adults and in the elderly.
TI  - Phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. However, the phylogenetic relationships among LAB species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. RESULTS: We performed a phylogenetic analysis of LAB species based on 232 genes from 28 LAB genome sequences. Regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. The LAB species examined were divided into two groups. Group 1 included families Enterococcaceae and Streptococcaceae. Group 2 included families Lactobacillaceae and Leuconostocaceae. Within Group 2, the LAB species were divided into two clades. One clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus Lactobacillus and two other species, Lb. sakei and Lb. casei. In the acidophilus complex, Lb. delbrueckii separated first, while Lb. acidophilus/Lb. helveticus and Lb. gasseri/Lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. The other clade within Group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, Lb. salivarius, Lb. plantarum, Lb. brevis, Lb. reuteri, Lb. fermentum, and the genera Pediococcus, Oenococcus, and Leuconostoc. In this clade, Lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to Lb. plantarum/Lb. brevis pair and Pediococcus, and the other including Oenococcus/Leuconostoc pair and Lb. reuteri/Lb. fermentum pair. In addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be more useful than others. The genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (TRSB), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein B (uvrB), DNA polymerase III (polC) and penicillin binding protein 2B (pbpB). CONCLUSIONS: Our phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of LAB species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. We infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in LAB species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. Further analyses of more genes from additional, representative LAB species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of LAB species to various environmental niches.
TI  - [Classification of domestic probiotic cultures of Lactobacillus genus].
AB  - AIM: To study strains of bacteria from Lactobacillus genus using combination of microbiological and molecular biological methods in order to define more accurately their systematic position and biochemical characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen cultures of Lactobacillus bacteria isolated from stool of healthy persons were studied: L. plantarum CS 396, L. plantarum 8-PA-3, L. plantarum 421-2, L. fermentum 90-TC-4, L. delbrueckii gKNM 101, L. delbrueckii gKNM 526, L. acidophilus Er 317/402 NARINE, L. acidophilus 100 ash, L. acidophilus NK-1, L. acidophilus NNIE, L. acidophilus K3sh24, L. brevis gKNM 23 11, L. casei gKNM 577. Their enzymatic activity relative to 50 sugars was studied using API-50 system. Structure of proximal region of 16S rRNA gene was studied also. RESULTS: According to results of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis strains were divided on 2 groups: 1) L. casei gKNM 577, L. plantarum 8-PA-3, L. plantarum CS 396, which species belonging corresponded to stated description. Comparison of nucleotide sequence of 16S rRNA gene of group 2 strains with nucleotide sequences database revealed that cultures NK-1, Er315/402 NARINE, 100 ash, NNIE identified early as L. acidophilus belong to species L. helveticus; L. brevis gKNM 23 and L. acidophilus K3sh24--to group L. casei/paracasei, L. delbrueckii gKNM 101 and L. fermentum 90-TC-4--to L. plantarum, L. delbrueckii gKNM 526--to L. fermentum, and L. plantarum 421-2--to L. rhamnosus. CONCLUSION: Obtained data allowed to perform taxonomic reclassification of species belonging of studied probiotic cultures of lactobacilli according to modem level of systematic of bacteria.
TI  - Microbial diversity, dynamics and activity throughout manufacturing and ripening  of Castelmagno PDO cheese.
AB  - The diversity, dynamics and activity of Castelmagno PDO cheese microbiota were studied in three batches produced in a floor valley farm, in the Grana Valley (northwest Italy), during the wintertime. Samples of milk, curd and cheese (core and subsurface) at different ripening time were submitted to both culture-dependent and -independent analysis. In particular, DNA and RNA directly extracted from the matrices were studied by PCR-Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR-DGGE. Culture-dependent methods highlighted the initial dominance of a thermophilic streptococcal population with the species Streptococcus thermophilus and S. agalactiae. Then, mesophilic lactococci occurred among isolates during manufacturing, with Lactococcus lactis which was also well represented in the first month of Castelmagno PDO ripening. At this point and throughout the ripening, lactobacilli prevailed in cheese samples, represented from Lactobacillus plantarum and Lb. casei. Culture-independent analysis underlined the undoubted role of L. lactis, actively involved in both Castelmagno PDO manufacturing and ripening. Despite Lb. helveticus was never isolated on selective media, a DGGE band referred to this microorganism was detected, at RNA level, in samples from ripened cheeses. On the other hand, Lb. plantarum was widely isolated from the plates, among lactobacilli, but never detected by direct analysis. Due to the importance of microbiota in the sensory richness and properties of traditional cheeses, new information have been added, in this work, on microbial diversity of Castelmagno PDO cheese.
TI  - Effects of selected lactic acid bacteria on the characteristics of amaranth sourdough.
AB  - BACKGROUND: As the processing of amaranth in baked goods is challenging, the use  of sourdough fermentation is a promising possibility to exploit the advantages of this raw material. In this study the fermentation properties of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paralimentarius and Lactobacillus helveticus in amaranth-based sourdough were examined in order to validate them as starter cultures. pH, total titratable acidity (TTA) and lactic/acetic acid ratio of the sourdough and sensory properties of the resulting wheat bread were evaluated using fermentation temperatures of 30 and 35 degrees C. RESULTS: While fermentation pH, TTA and lactic acid concentration showed small variations with the use of L. plantarum and L. paralimentarius, L. helveticus reached the most intensive acidification after initial adaptation to the substrate. Acetic acid production was independent of lactic acid metabolism. Furthermore, the lactic/acetic acid ratio exceeded recommendation by 10-35 times (fermentation quotient 25-82). Sensory evaluation showed no significant differences between the two fermentation temperatures but differences among the three micro-organisms. CONCLUSION: The results provide relevant information on the fermentation properties required of a customised starter for amaranth flour.
TI  - Characterization of a novel LysM domain from Lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to display heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The endolysin Lyb5, from Lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phiPYB5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative bacteria. Sequence analysis revealed that the C terminus of the endolysin Lyb5 (Ly5C) contained three putative lysin motif (LysM) repeat regions, implying that Ly5C was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. To investigate the potential of Ly5C for surface display, green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused to Ly5C at its N or C terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli. After being mixed with various cells in vitro, GFP was successfully displayed on the surfaces of Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, Lb. brevis, Lb. plantarum, Lb. fermentum, Lb. delbrueckii, Lb. helveticus, and Streptococcus thermophilus cells. Increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated L. lactis and Lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for Ly5C. Moreover, the pH and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of GFP-Ly5C, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. All results suggested that Ly5C was a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (LAB). To demonstrate the applicability of the Ly5C-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal) from Paenibacillus sp. strain K1, replacing GFP, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of LAB cells via Ly5C. The success in surface display of GFP and beta-Gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in LAB.
TI  - [Biodiversity of Lactobacilli from fermented milk products in Northern Tibet].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In order to study the biodiversity of Lactobacilli from Northern Tibet in China, we developed enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence polymerase chain reaction (ERIC-PCR) technique. METHODS: Seventy seven Lactobacillus strains were isolated from traditional fermented milk products which are made by herd man families in Northern Tibet of China. By ERIC-PCR technique method, using NTSYS-pc2.1 software, we investigated the biodiversity of the strains. RESULTS: The amplified bands of ERIC-PCR were clear and stable with high repetition and high polymorphisms. The cluster analysis showed that at level 0.73, 77 tested strains were clustered into 4 groups: A1: strains of Lactobacillus casei (35.06% of the strains), A2: strains of Lactobacillus fermentum (61.04% of the strains), A3: strains of Lactobacillus helveticus and A4: strains of Lactobacillus plantarum. The biodiversity of the isolates from Aland A2 groups was further investigated. A1 could be divided into 5 genotypes at the similarity of 80.0%. A2 could be divided into 6 genotypes at the similarity of 84.0%. CONCLUSION: Using ERIC-PCR technique, Lactobacilli from Northern Tibet could be distinguished at species level.
TI  - Sequence analysis of plasmid pIR52-1 from Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 and investigation of its origin of replication.
AB  - Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 is a bacterium used in commercial probiotic preparations. R0052 contains a small, cryptic plasmid comprised of eight open reading frames, four of which encode proteins of unknown function. Based on the sequence of the replication initiation protein RepA, pIR52-1 is a member of the recently described RepA_N family of Gram-positive theta-replicating plasmids. The repA gene of pIR52-1 is the minimal origin of replication for L. helveticus and other Lactobacillus hosts. Additionally, pIR52-1 belongs to a subgroup of the RepA_N plasmid family which have RepA proteins of high amino acid identity and a conserved, non-coding element upstream of repA which, in pIR52-1, is responsible for the control of plasmid copy number and contributes to plasmid maintenance.
TI  - Main microorganisms involved in the fermentation of Ugandan ghee.
AB  - Ghee is widely produced from a traditional fermented butter-like product named mashita in western Uganda. However, no detailed studies have been done to identify the microorganisms involved in mashita fermentation. The aim of this study was to identify the microorganisms present at the end of mashita ripening using culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. The most commonly identified species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in mashita using culture-dependent techniques were Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus perolens constituting 37.3%, 10.1%, 8.1% and 7.7% of total bacterial colonies isolated respectively. L. paracasei was the only bacterial species identified in all mashita samples by culture-dependent technique. Two of the four most commonly isolated LAB species (L. helveticus and L. plantarum) were also identified in mashita by a culture-independent method (PCR-DGGE). Other main LAB species identified in mashita by PCR-DGGE were Bifidobacterium sp., Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus acetotolerans, Lactobacillus sp., Lactococcus raffinolactis, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Streptococcus salivarius. The main species of acetic acid bacteria (AAB) identified in the mashita using PCR-DGGE method were Acetobacter aceti, Acetobacter lovaniensis, Acetobacter orientalis and Acetobacter pasteurianus. PCR-DGGE identification of yeasts showed that Brettanomyces custersianus, Candida silvae, Geotrichum sp., Issatchenkia occidentalis, Issatchenkia orientalis, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Trichosporon asahii were main yeast species in mashita. A. lovaniensis, A. aceti, and I. orientalis were identified in all the six mashita samples analyzed using PCR-DGGE method. Other microbial species were only found in some samples. These results indicate that LAB and yeasts, as in similar fermentation products, but also AAB are main microbial groups involved in mashita fermentation.
TI  - Fermented goats' milk produced with selected multiple starters as a potentially functional food.
AB  - A screening among five lactic acid bacteria, used alone or in combination, led to select a mixed starter (Streptococcus thermophilus CR12, Lactobacillus casei LC01, Lactobacillus helveticus PR4, Lactobacillus plantarum 1288) capable to produce a fermented goats' milk containing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides. The fermented milk was characterized by cell counts of lactic acid bacteria not lower than 7.0 log cfu g(-1), even after 45 days of storage at 4 degrees C. Fermentation of goats' milk resulted in the production of ca. 28 mg kg(-1) of GABA. Furthermore the fermented goats' milk had an in vitro ACE-inhibitory activity of ca. 73%. Prolonged cold storage did not significantly affect both the concentration of GABA and the ACE-inhibitory activity. Moreover, the taurine content did not significantly vary during both fermentation and the entire storage period.
TI  - Characterization of four plasmids harboured in a Lactobacillus brevis strain encoding a novel bacteriocin, brevicin 925A, and construction of a shuttle vector for lactic acid bacteria and Escherichia coli.
AB  - In this study we isolated over 250 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) candidates from fruit, flowers, vegetables and a fermented food to generate an LAB library. One strain, designated 925A, isolated from kimchi (a traditional Korean fermented dish made from Chinese cabbage) produced a novel type of bacteriocin, brevicin 925A, which is effective against certain LAB, including strains of Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Bacillus and Listeria. Strain 925A, identified as Lactobacillus brevis, harboured at least four plasmids and we determined the entire nucleotide sequence of each one. The four plasmids were designated pLB925A01-04, and have molecular sizes of 1815, 3524, 8881 and 65 037 bp, respectively. We obtained bacteriocin non-producing derivatives by treatment of strain 925A with novobiocin. All of these derivatives, which were susceptible to their own antibacterial product, lost the largest plasmid, pLB925A04, suggesting that the genes for bacteriocin biosynthesis (breB and breC) and immunity (breE) are located on pLB925A04. The partial amino acid sequence of purified brevicin 925A and sequence analysis of pLB925A04 showed that breB is the structural gene for brevicin 925A. We constructed a shuttle vector (pLES003, 6134 bp) that can replicate in both Escherichia coli and LAB such as Lactobacillus plantarum, Lb. brevis, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus hilgardii and Enterococcus hirae. To determine the function of gene breE, which displays no significant similarity to any other sequences in the blast search database, the gene was inserted into pLES003. A pLB925A04-cured derivative transformed with pLES003 carrying breE acquired immunity to brevicin 925A, suggesting that breE encodes an immunity protein.
TI  - Adaptability of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts to sourdoughs prepared from cereals, pseudocereals and cassava and use of competitive strains as starters.
AB  - The adaptability of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeasts to sourdoughs prepared  from cereals, pseudocereals and cassava was investigated using PCR-DGGE and bacteriological culture combined with rRNA gene sequence analysis. Sourdoughs were prepared either from flours of the cereals wheat, rye, oat, barley, rice, maize, and millet, or from the pseudocereals amaranth, quinoa, and buckwheat, or from cassava, using a starter consisting of various species of LAB and yeasts. Doughs were propagated until a stable microbiota was established. The dominant LAB and yeast species were Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus paralimentarius, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus pontis, Lactobacillus spicheri, Issatchenkia orientalis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The proportion of the species within the microbiota varied. L. paralimentarius dominated in the pseudocereal sourdoughs, L. fermentum, L. plantarum and L. spicheri in the cassava sourdough, and L. fermentum, L. helveticus and L. pontis in the cereal sourdoughs. S. cerevisiae constituted the dominating yeast, except for quinoa sourdough, where I. orientalis also reached similar counts, and buckwheat and oat sourdoughs, where no yeasts could be detected. To assess the usefulness of competitive LAB and yeasts as starters, the fermentations were repeated using flours from rice, maize, millet and the pseudocereals, and by starting the dough fermentation with selected dominant strains. At the end of fermentation, most of starter strains belonged to the dominating microbiota. For the rice, millet and quinoa sourdoughs the species composition was similar to that of the prior fermentation, whereas in the other sourdoughs, the composition differed.
TI  - Isolation and preliminary probiotic selection of lactobacilli from koumiss in Inner Mongolia.
AB  - From 16 samples of traditional fermented koumiss collected in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China, forty-eight lactobacilli strains were isolated and phenotypically characterized by their abilities to ferment different carbohydrates and by additional biochemical tests. The dominant lactobacilli species were identified as L. casei (17 strains), L. helveticus (10 strains) and L. plantarum (8 strains), with a lower frequency of isolation for L. coryniformis subsp. coryniformis (5 strains), L. paracasei (3 strains), L. kefiranofaciens (2 strains), L. curvatus (1 strain), L. fermentum (1 strain) and W. kandleri (1 strain). The pH values of all these samples were ranging from 3.37 to 3.94. In isolates, L. casei Zhang, L. helveticus ZL12-1, and L. plantarum BX6-6 were selected as potentially probiotic strains through the preliminary tests including resistance to low acid, abilities to grow in MRS with bile salts, antimicrobial activities and the viabilities during prolonged cold storage in fermented milk. Moreover 16S rDNA was conducted to confirm the identification.
TI  - Selection and use of autochthonous multiple strain cultures for the manufacture of high-moisture traditional Mozzarella cheese.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum 18A, Lactobacillus helveticus 2B, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis 20F, Streptococcus thermophilus 22C, Enterococcus faecalis 32C and Enterococcus durans 16E were the most acidifying strains within 146 isolates for natural whey starters. The effect of media and temperature on 2 autochthonous multiple strain cultures (AMSI: 18A, 2B, 20F and 22C, 32C and 16E and AMSII: 18A, 2B, 20F and 22C) was studied. Genomic analysis showed a constant cell numbers for AMSII during 16 days of propagation in whey milk. Mozzarella cheese was made by using AMSII, commercial starter (CS) or citric acid (DA). Compared to other cheeses, the DA had a lower level of protein, ash, Ca, free amino acids and a higher level of moisture. Based on confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis, AMSII cheese showed the lowest microstructural variations during the period of storage compared to other cheeses. All the sensory attributes were scored highest for AMSII cheese. ASMII extend the shelf-life to ca. 12-15 days instead of the 5-7 days of traditional high-moisture Mozzarella cheese.
TI  - Diversity and dynamics of lactobacilli populations during ripening of RDO Camembert cheese.
AB  - The diversity and dynamics of Lactobacillus populations in traditional raw milk Camembert cheese were monitored throughout the manufacturing process in 3 dairies. Culture-dependent analysis was carried out on isolates grown on acidified de Man - Rogosa - Sharpe agar and Lactobacillus anaerobic de Man Rogosa Sharpe agar supplemented with vancomycin and bromocresol green media. The isolates were identified by polymerase chain reaction - temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-TGGE) and (or) species-specific PCR and (or) sequencing, and Lactobacillus paracasei and Lactobacillus plantarum isolates were characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Milk and cheese were subjected to culture-independent analysis by PCR-TGGE. Presumed lactobacilli were detected by plate counts throughout the ripening process. However, molecular analysis of total DNA and DNA of isolates failed to detect Lactobacillus spp. in certain cases. The dominant species in the 3 dairies was L. paracasei. PFGE analysis revealed 21 different profiles among 39 L. paracasei isolates. Lactobacillus plantarum was the second most isolated species, but it occurred nearly exclusively in one dairy. The other species isolated were Lactobacillus parabuchneri, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, a Lactobacillus psittaci/delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus/gallinarum/crispatus group, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus kefiri, and Lactobacillus perolens. Lactobacilli diversity at the strain level was high. Dynamics varied among dairies, and each cheese exhibited a specific picture of species and strains.
TI  - Binding of heterocyclic aromatic amines by lactic acid bacteria: results of a comprehensive screening trial.
AB  - Aim of the present study was a comprehensive investigation of the detoxification  capacities of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) towards heterocyclic aromatic amines (HCA) formed during cooking of meat. It has been postulated that LAB prevent genotoxic and/or carcinogenic effects of HCA in laboratory rodents and humans via direct binding mechanisms. We measured the removal of the most abundant cooked food mutagens (AalphaC, PhIP, IQ, MeIQx, DiMeIQx) by eight LAB species. From each species, twelve strains were tested in liquid binding experiments with HPLC coupled with coulometric electrode array detection. The highest removal rates were observed with the representatives of the L. helveticus and S. thermophilus groups, which were seven to eight times more effective than L. kefir and L. plantarum. Strong and statistically significant differences were seen in the binding behaviour of the individual amines, the ranking order of detoxification being AalphaC > DiMeIQx > MeIQx > IQ > PhIP. Results of Salmonella/microsome assays with strain TA98 showed that the binding of AalphaC and PhIP to LAB correlates with the reduction of their mutagenic activities. This study may contribute to the development of strategies concerning the adverse health effects of HCA utilizing highly protective LAB for the production of fermented foods.
TI  - Redox potential to discriminate among species of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To verify to what degree reducing capacity is a characterizing parameter of a species, and of the strains themselves within a given species, of lactic acid bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-eight strains belonging to 10 species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from traditional Italian cheeses were studied for their reduction activity: Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Pediococcus pentosaceus. It was observed that the lactococci reached minimum redox potential before the lactobacilli. The reduction rate of Enterococcus spp. and L. lactis ssp. lactis was higher than that of the streptococci and Lactobacillus spp. All the P. pentosaceus strains had poor reduction activity compared with the other species. CONCLUSIONS: The evolution of the redox potential in milk over a time span of 24 h has been found to be a parameter that characterizes a species: the different courses corresponding to the species in question are clearly evident, and interesting differences can also be noted within the same species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The reduction aptitude of strains might be used to select and adapt appropriate strains for use as starters for dairy products.
TI  - New signaling molecules in some gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A new family of putative signaling molecules having a 2(5H)-furanone configuration has been described in this work. They were released during late exponential or stationary phase in different growth media by some gram-positive bacteria, such as Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paraplantarum, Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, Enterococcus faecalis, and a gram-negative species, i.e. Salmonella enterica. A pair of 2(5H)-furanones called furanones A and B occurred in all the conditioned media (CMs) of the species considered. These two molecules showed similar retention times and their spectral data shared the key fragments to include them in the 2(5H)-furanones family. However, some differences were observed in the mass fragmentation profiles. In particular the use of PCA analysis of all the mass fragments enabled the grouping of furanone A profiles of S. enterica, L. helveticus, L. plantarum, L. paraplantarum, L. sanfranciscensis and E. faecalis in one unique cluster with only few exceptions. On the other hand, the mass fragmentation profiles of furanone B of the major part of the species and strains could be grouped together and were differentiated from those of L. helveticus. The specific activity of cell-free supernatants of high density cultures of S. enterica confirmed that the release of active molecules, and specifically of furanones A and B, was cell density dependent. Moreover, a preliminary experiment suspending S. enterica cells into cell-free supernatants of L. helveticus previously exposed to an oxidative stress demonstrated that furanones A and B have a strong interspecific activity. In fact cell autolysis and cell envelope damages were observed with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) in S. enterica.
TI  - Diversity and mechanisms of alkali tolerance in lactobacilli.
AB  - We determined the maximum pH that allows growth (pHmax) for 34 strains of lactobacilli. High alkali tolerance was exhibited by strains of Lactobacillus casei, L. paracasei subsp. tolerans, L. paracasei subsp. paracasei, L. curvatus, L. pentosus, and L. plantarum that originated from plant material, with pHmax values between 8.5 and 8.9. Among these, L. casei NRIC 1917 and L. paracasei subsp. tolerans NRIC 1940 showed the highest pHmax, at 8.9. Digestive tract isolates of L. gasseri, L. johnsonii, L. reuteri, L. salivarius subsp. salicinius, and L. salivarius subsp. salivarius exhibited moderate alkali tolerance, with pHmax values between 8.1 and 8.5. Dairy isolates of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and L. helveticus exhibited no alkali tolerance, with pHmax values between 6.7 and 7.1. Measurement of the internal pH of representative strains revealed the formation of transmembrane proton gradients (DeltapH) in a reversed direction (i.e., acidic interior) at alkaline external-pH ranges, regardless of their degrees of alkali tolerance. Thus, the reversed DeltapH did not determine alkali tolerance diversity. However, the DeltapH contributed to alkali tolerance, as the pHmax values of several strains decreased with the addition of nigericin, which dissipates DeltapH. Although neutral external-pH values resulted in the highest glycolysis activity in the presence of nigericin regardless of alkali tolerance, substantial glucose utilization was still detected in the alkali-tolerant strains, even in a pH range of between 8.0 and 8.5, at which the remaining strains lost most activity. Therefore, the alkali tolerance of glycolysis reactions contributes greatly to the determination of alkali tolerance diversity.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the one humped camel milk  produced in Morocco.
AB  - One hundred and twenty (120) strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were enumerated and isolated from raw dromedary milk in Morocco using various cultured media. Strains isolated were characterized by phenotypic, physiological and biochemical properties. Results showed that high counts of LAB were found. Presumptive lactobacilli counts ranged from 2.5x10(2) to 6x10(7)cfu/ml, presumptive lactococci levels varied from 5x10(2) to 6x10(7)cfu/ml, presumptive streptococci counts varied from 4.2x10(2) to 8x10(7)cfu/ml, presumptive leuconostoc levels ranged from 5.4x10(2) to 5.4x10(7)cfu/ml. Results showed also that Lactobacillus and Lactococcus were the predominant genera with 37.5% and 25.8%, respectively. The dominated species found were Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (17.5%), Lactobacillus helveticus (10%), Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (9.20%), Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei (5.80%) and Lactobacillus plantarum (5%). This is the first report on the characterization of LAB strains isolated from the one humped camel milk produced in Morocco.
TI  - Molecular identification of vaginal lactobacilli isolated from Bulgarian women.
AB  - Lactobacilli play an important role in maintaining the vaginal health of women. The development of suitable bacterial replacement therapies for the treatment of vaginosis requires knowledge of the vaginal lactobacilli species representation. The aim of this study was to identify at the species level vaginal Lactobacillus isolates obtained from Bulgarian women in childbearing age by using different molecular methods. Twenty-two strains of lactobacilli isolated from vaginal samples were identified and grouped according to their genetic relatedness. A combined approach, which included amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA), ribotyping and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with species-specific oligonucleotide primers was applied. All vaginal isolates were grouped into 5 clusters in comparison with a set of 21 reference strains based on the initial ARDRA results, which was then confirmed by ribotyping. Finally, the strains were subjected to PCR analysis with eight different species-specific primer pairs, which allowed most of them to be classified as belonging to one of the following species: Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactobacillus plantarum. In conclusion, this study suggests that the most straightforward identification strategy for vaginal lactobacilli would be grouping by ARDRA or ribotyping, followed by PCR specific primers identification at species level.
TI  - Induction of systemic and mucosal immune response and decrease in Streptococcus pneumoniae colonization by nasal inoculation of mice with recombinant lactic acid bacteria expressing pneumococcal surface antigen A.
AB  - Mucosal epithelia constitute the first barriers to be overcome by pathogens during infection. The induction of protective IgA in this location is important for the prevention of infection and can be achieved through different mucosal immunization strategies. Lactic acid bacteria have been tested in the last few years as live vectors for the delivery of antigens at mucosal sites, with promising results. In this work, Streptococcus pneumoniae PsaA antigen was expressed in different species of lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus helveticus. After nasal inoculation of C57Bl/6 mice, their ability to induce both systemic (IgG in serum) and mucosal (IgA in saliva, nasal and bronchial washes) anti-PsaA antibodies was determined. Immunization with L. lactis MG1363 induced very low levels of IgA and IgG, possibly by the low amount of PsaA expressed in this strain and its short persistence in the nasal mucosa. All three lactobacilli persisted in the nasal mucosa for 3 days and produced a similar amount of PsaA protein (150-250 ng per 10(9) CFU). However, L. plantarum NCDO1193 and L. helveticus ATCC15009 elicited the highest antibody response (IgA and IgG). Vaccination with recombinant lactobacilli but not with recombinant L. lactis led to a decrease in S. pneumoniae recovery from nasal mucosa upon a colonization challenge. Our results confirm that certain Lactobacillus strains have intrinsic properties that make them suitable candidates for mucosal vaccination experiments.
TI  - Use of unsupervised and supervised artificial neural networks for the identification of lactic acid bacteria on the basis of SDS-PAGE patterns of whole cell proteins.
AB  - Conventional multivariate statistical techniques (hierarchical cluster analysis,  linear discriminant analysis) and unsupervised (Kohonen Self Organizing Map) and supervised (Bayesian network) artificial neural networks were compared for as tools for the classification and identification of 352 SDS-PAGE patterns of whole cell proteins of lactic acid bacteria belonging to 22 species of the genera Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Enterococcus, Lactococcus and Streptococcus including 47 reference strains. Electrophoretic data were pre-treated using the logistic weighting function described by Piraino et al. [Piraino, P., Ricciardi, A., Lanorte, M. T., Malkhazova, I., Parente, E., 2002. A new procedure for data reduction in electrophoretic fingerprints of whole-cell proteins. Biotechnol. Lett. 24, 1477-1482]. Hierarchical cluster analysis provided a satisfactory classification of the patterns but was unable to discriminate some species (Leuconostoc, Lb. sakei/Lb. curvatus, Lb. acidophilus/Lb. helveticus, Lb. plantarum/Lb. paraplantarum, Lc. lactis/Lc. raffinolactis). A 7x7 Kohonen self-organizing map (KSOM), trained with the patterns of the reference strains, provided a satisfactory classification of the patterns and was able to discriminate more species than hierarchical cluster analysis. The map was used in predictive mode to identify unknown strains and provided results which in 85.5% of cases matched the classification obtained by hierarchical cluster analysis. Two supervised tools, linear discriminant analysis and a 23:5:2 Bayesian network were proven to be highly effective in the discrimination of SDS-PAGE patterns of Lc. lactis from those of other species. We conclude that data reduction by logistic weighting coupled to traditional multivariate statistical analysis or artificial neural networks provide an effective tool for the classification and identification of lactic acid bacteria on the basis of SDS-PAGE patterns of whole cell proteins.
TI  - Effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  - Fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. In this study, three sourdough yeasts, Candida milleri CBS 8195, Saccharomyces cerevisiae TS 146, and Torulaspora delbrueckii TS 207; a control, baker's yeast S. cerevisiae ALKO 743; and four Lactobacillus spp., L. acidophilus TSB 262, L. brevis TSB 307, L. plantarum TSB 304, and L. sanfranciscensis TSB 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. The microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. Total folate contents were determined using Lactobacillus rhamnosus (ATCC 7469) as the growth indicator organism. The microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. Yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. Strains of Lactobacillus bulgaricus, L. casei, L. curvatus, L. fermentum, L. helveticus, Pediococcus spp., and Streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. Although the four Lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal. It was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. Fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. Two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as Enterobacter cowanii and Pantoea agglomerans.
TI  - Rapid identification of Lactobacillus acidophilus by restriction analysis of the  16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region and flanking 23S rRNA gene.
AB  - A rapid molecular approach was developed for the initial identification of Lactobacillus acidophilus strains which are difficult to identify using a single biochemical test. The 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer regions and flanking 23S rRNA genes of 19 strains of lactobacilli were amplified and the nucleotide sequences and restriction site polymorphisms were analyzed. AluI was the most useful of the restriction enzymes analyzed and produced reproducible digestion profiles in the L. helveticus, L. plantarum, and L. casei groups, as well as in L. acidophilus. This restriction fragment length polymorphism method may be useful for the identification of L. acidophilus strains in dairy products.
TI  - Rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by M13-generated, RAPD-PCR fingerprint databases.
AB  - About a thousand lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific PCR and RAPD-PCR, respectively. RAPD-PCR profiles, which were obtained by using the M13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by BioNumerics software. Cluster analysis of the combined RAPD-PCR fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library, which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. A library unit, in this case, can be considered to be a definable taxon. The strains belonged to 11 main RAPD-PCR fingerprinting library units identified as Lactobacillus casei/paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus brevis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis. The possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. The proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful LAB strain collection. The same approach could also be applied to identify LAB strains isolated from other food ecosystems.
TI  - Metabolic activities of Lactobacillus spp. strains isolated from kefir.
AB  - A total of 21 strains of Lactobacillus species were isolated from Turkish kefir samples, in order to select the most suitable strains according to their metabolic activities including probiotic properties. As a result of the identification tests, 21 Lactobacillus isolates were identified as L. acidophilus (4%), L. helveticus (9%), L. brevis (9%), L. bulgaricus (14%), L. plantarum (14%), L. casei (19%) and L. lactis (28%). The amount of produced lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, proteolytic activity, and acetaldehyde productions of Lactobacillus spp. were determined. Different amounts of lactic acid were produced by strains studies; however, lactic acid levels were 1.7-11.4 mg/mL. All strains produced hydrogen peroxide. L. bulgaricus Z14L strain showed no proteolytic activity, L. casei Z6L strain produced the maximum amount (0.16 mg/mL) of proteolytic activity. Acetaldehyde concentration produced in Lactobacillus strains ranged between 0.88-3.52 microg/mL.
TI  - Interactions between high pressure homogenization and antimicrobial activity of lysozyme and lactoperoxidase.
AB  - It was the objective of this work to evaluate the effect of high pressure homogenization on the activity of antimicrobial enzymes such as lysozyme and lactoperoxidase against a selected group of Gram positive and Gram negative species inoculated in skim milk. Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus plantarum and Listeria monocytogenes were the most pressure resistant species while Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas putida, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Salmonella enteritidis were found to be very sensitive to the hyperbaric treatment. The enzyme addition enhanced the instantaneous pressure efficacy on almost all the considered species as indicated by their instantaneous viability loss following the treatment. Moreover, the combination of the enzyme and high pressure homogenization significantly affected the recovery and growth dynamics of several of the considered species. Although L. monocytogenes was slightly sensitive to pressure, the combination of the two stress factors induced a significant viability loss within 3 h and an extension of lag phases in skim milk during incubation at 37 degrees C. The hypothesis formulated in this work is that the interaction of high pressure homogenization and lysozyme or lactoperoxidase is associated to conformational modifications of the two proteins with a consequent enhancement of their activity. This hypothesis is supported by the experimental results also regarding the increased antimicrobial activity against L. plantarum of the previously pressurised lysozyme with respect to that of the native enzyme.
TI  - Three new insertion sequence elements ISLdl2, ISLdl3, and ISLdl4 in Lactobacillus delbrueckii: isolation, molecular characterization, and potential use for strain identification.
AB  - A group of new insertion sequence (IS) elements, ISLdl2, ISLdl3, and ISLdl4, from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis ATCC 15808 was isolated, characterized, and used for strain identification together with ISLdl1, recently characterized as an L. delbrueckii IS element belonging to the ISL3 family. ISLdl2 was 1367 bp in size and had a 24 bp IR and an 8 bp DR. The single ORF of ISLdl2 encoded a protein of 392 aa similar to transposases of the IS256 family. ISLdl3 had a single ORF encoding a protein of 343 aa similar to transposases of the IS30 family. Finally, ISLdl4 had a single ORF encoding a protein of 406 aa and displayed homology to the transposases of the IS110 family. ISLdl4 was only slight different from ISL4 (Accession No. AY040213). ISLdl1, ISLdl2, and ISLdl4 were present in all of the 10 L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis and subsp. delbrueckii strains tested, as well as in three of the 11 L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strains tested. ISLdl3 was present only in four closely related strains of L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis. These IS elements were not observed in Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, or Lactobacillus plantarum. A cluster of IS elements, ISLdl1, ISLdl2, ISLdl3, ISLdl4, and ISL6, was observed in L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis strain ATCC 15808. Within this cluster, ISLdl4 was inserted into ISLdl1 between the left IR and the start codon of ORF455, encoding a putative transposase. Most of the integration sites of the IS elements were strain-specific. We have observed that IS elements can migrate from one strain to another as integral parts of bacterial DNA by using phage LL-H as a vehicle. We demonstrate for the first time that inverse PCR and vectorette PCR methods with primers based on sequences of the IS elements could be used for identification of L. delbrueckii strains.
TI  - A food-grade cloning vector for lactic acid bacteria based on the nisin immunity  gene nisI.
AB  - A new food-grade cloning vector for lactic acid bacteria was constructed using the nisin immunity gene nisI as a selection marker. The food-grade plasmid, pLEB 590, was constructed entirely of lactococcal DNA: the pSH 71 replicon, the nisI gene, and the constitutive promoter P45 for nisI expression. Electroporation into Lactococcus lactis MG 1614 with 60 international units (IU) nisin/ml selection yielded approximately 10(5) transformants/ micro g DNA. MG 1614 carrying pLEB 590 was shown to be able to grow in medium containing a maximum of 250 IU nisin/ml. Plasmid pLEB 590 was successfully transformed into an industrial L. lactis cheese starter carrying multiple cryptic plasmids. Suitability for molecular cloning was confirmed by cloning and expressing the proline iminopeptidase gene pepI from Lactobacillus helveticus in L. lactis and Lb. plantarum. These results show that the food-grade expression system reported in this paper has potential for expression of foreign genes in lactic acid bacteria in order to construct improved starter bacteria for food applications.
TI  - The expression signals of the Lactobacillus brevis slpA gene direct efficient heterologous protein production in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - A cassette based on the expression signals of the Lactobacillus brevis surface (S)-layer protein gene (slpA) was constructed. The low-copy-number vector pKTH2095, derived from pGK12, was used as the cloning vector. The efficiency of slpA promoters in intracellular protein production was studied using three reporter genes, beta-glucuronidase (gusA), luciferase (luc) and aminopeptidase N (pepN) in three different lactic acid bacteria hosts: Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus gasseri. The S-layer promoters were recognized in each strain and especially L. lactis and Lb. plantarum exhibited high levels of transcripts. The production kinetics of reporter proteins was studied as a function of growth. The GusA, Luc and PepN activities varied considerably among the lactic acid bacterial strains studied. The highest levels of beta-glucuronidase and luciferase activity were obtained in L. lactis. The level of GusA obtained in L. lactis corresponded to over 15% of the total cellular proteins. The highest level of aminopeptidase N activity was achieved in Lb. plantarum where PepN corresponded up to 28% of the total cellular proteins at the late exponential phase of growth. This level of PepN activity is 30-fold higher than that in Lb. helveticus, which is the species from which the pepN gene originates.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus species against Vibrio species.
AB  - Forty-one Lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of Vibrio. L. plantarum and L. casei were the most effective, and L. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of Vibrio species. L. gasseri and L. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while L. reuteri and L. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against Vibrio species. L. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against Vibrio species. However, none of the Lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of Salmonella enteritidis, S. typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. Inhibition of the Vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the Lactobacillus species.
TI  - Molecular characterization of the Lactobacillus community in traditional processing of Mozzarella cheese.
AB  - The natural Lactobacillus community involved in traditional Mozzarella cheese production has been investigated. The bacterial associations of whey, curd before stretching and Mozzarella were analyzed using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) to follow growth kinetics, and 16S rDNA sequencing to identify the taxonomical position of isolated strains. Analysis of RAPD fingerprints revealed that the Lactobacillus community was composed of 13 different biotypes and the sequence analysis of 16S rDNA demonstrated that the isolated strains belong to L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. helveticus and L. casei subsp. casei. In addition, two strains of Weissella hellenica were isolated on selective media for lactobacilli. The four L. casei subsp. casei strains and W. hellenica contained sequences related to the prtP gene coding for proteinase, and the highest proteolytic activity in milk was found in one strain of L. casei subsp.casei.
TI  - Electrotransformation of Lactobacillus plantarum using linearized plasmid DNA.
AB  - Evidence is presented that linearized plasmid DNA is capable of electrotransforming Lactobacillus plantarum at a frequency 500-fold lower than with the covalently closed circular molecule. When the linearized plasmid was religated prior to transformation the transformation efficiency was < 10-fold higher, suggesting that open circular plasmid was only slightly more efficient in the transformation of Lact. plantarum than linear DNA. This observation has implications for direct cloning into this species since the high background transformation frequency produced by the linear DNA could potentially obscure the recovery of clones. Nevertheless, using positive selection for enhanced chloramphenicol resistance, cloned fragments of Lact. helveticus DNA were obtained using the shuttle vector pGKV110.
TI  - Electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases, a new tool for bacterial species identification: application to 10 Lactobacillus species.
AB  - Lactobacilli have been used as industrial starters for a long time, but in many cases their phenotypic identification is still neither easy nor reliable. Previously we observed that the cell wall peptidoglycan hydrolases of Lactobacillus helveticus were highly conserved enzymes; the aim of the present work was to determine whether peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns obtained by renaturing SDS-PAGE could be of interest in the identification of lactobacilli species. For that purpose, the peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns of 94 strains of lactobacilli belonging to 10 different species were determined; most of the species studied are used either in dairy, meat, bakery or vegetable fermentations: L. helveticus, L. acidophilus, L. delbrueckii, L. brevis, L. fermentum, L. jensenii, L. plantarum, L. sake, L. curvatus and L. reuteri. Within a species, the strains exhibited highly similar patterns: the apparent molecular weights of the lytic bands were identical, with only slight variations of intensity. Moreover, each species, including phylogenetically close species such as L. sake and L. curvatus, or L. acidophilus and L. helveticus, gave a different pattern. Interestingly, the closer the species were phylogenetically, the more related were their patterns. The sensitivity of the method was checked using various quantities of L. acidophilus cells: a peptidoglycan hydrolase extract of 5 x 10(6) cells was sufficient to obtain an informative pattern, as was a single colony. Finally, the method was also successfully applied to distinguish two Carnobacterium species. In conclusion, the electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases is proposed as a new tool for lactobacilli identification: it is rapid, sensitive and effective even for phylogenetically close species. Furthermore, this work provides the first evidence of the potential overall taxonomic value of bacterial peptidoglycan hydrolases.
TI  - Development of RAPD protocol for typing of strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci.
AB  - A protocol for typing strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci based on randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fragments has been developed. Using a single 10-mer primer, fingerprints were achieved without the need to isolate genomic DNA. Different conditions of DNA release and amplification were investigated in order to obtain reproducible results and high discrimination among strains. This RAPD protocol was successfully applied for the typing of strains belonging to the species Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. helveticus, Lact. casei, Lact. reuteri, Lact. plantarum, Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium and Streptococcus thermophilus.
TI  - Comparison of proteolytic activities in various lactobacilli.
AB  - A total of 169 Lactobacillus strains from 12 species (Lb. acidophilus, Lb. brevis, Lb. buchneri, Lb. casei, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Lb. fermentum, Lb. helveticus, Lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei, Lb. plantarum and Lb. rhamnosus), isolated from raw milk and various milk products, and 9 Lactococcus lactis strains were evaluated for peptidase activities with five chromogenic substrates and a tryptic digest of casein. Within each species, the peptidase activity of the cell-free extracts of the strains varied. Furthermore, differences were observed between the Lactobacillus species and Lc. lactis. Lb. helveticus had by far the highest hydrolysing activities towards all substrates, indicating the presence of powerful aminopeptidases, X-prolyl-dipeptidyl aminopeptidases and proline iminopeptidases. Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus possessed high hydrolysing activities towards substrates containing proline, alanyl-prolyl-p-nitroanilide and prolyl-p-nitroanilide. On the other hand, Lb. fermentum and Lb. brevis could be considered as weakly proteolytic species. A more detailed study with highly proteolytic Lactobacillus strains indicated that at least three different proteinases or endopeptidases were present. Compared with Lc. lactis, the Lactobacillus strains had a much lower hydrolytic action on glutamyl-glutamic acid, suggesting that glutamyl aminopeptidase was absent in lactobacilli.
TI  - The lysins of bacteriophages infecting lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - This short review highlights the complete absence of literature on lysins of bacteriophages infecting species like S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Pediococcus and Leuconostoc species, L. helveticus, L. acidophilus, L. plantarum and L. brevis, which are also widely used in the dairy industry. The lysins described share some similar biochemical characteristics: optimal pH and temperature, site of hydrolysis inside the peptidoglycan, and some activators and inhibitors. The cloning of the genes encoding these lysins only began in the last few years and four of them have been completely sequenced. In the future, these lysin genes could be interestingly compared to the host autolysin(s) gene(s). By contrast, the passage of phage lysins through the cytoplasmic membrane of the host cell in order to reach the peptidoglycan (via a signal sequence or the presence of a holin) seems not to be clearly resolved. The presence of a second open-reading frame upstream from the gene of the lysin, enabling a putative holin to be encoded, has already been suggested. No doubt our ever increasing knowledge about bacteriophage genome organization will help to elucidate this question. Meanwhile the obtention of a Lactococcus strain with an autolytic phenotype, using a bacteriophage lysin gene, as well as the successful use of purified PL1 lysin to obtain protoplasts of L. casei encourage us to continue to explore the field of bacteriophage lysins.
TI  - Divergence in codon usage of Lactobacillus species.
AB  - We have analyzed codon usage patterns of 70 sequenced genes from different Lactobacillus species. Codon usage in lactobacilli is highly biased. Both inter-species and intra-species heterogeneity of codon usage bias was observed. Codon usage in L. acidophilus is similar to that in L. helveticus, but dissimilar to that in L. bulgaricus, L. casei, L. pentosus and L. plantarum. Codon usage in the latter three organisms is not significantly different, but is different from that in L. bulgaricus. Inter-species differences in codon usage can, at least in part, be explained by differences in mutational drift. L. bulgaricus shows GC drift, whereas all other species show AT drift. L. acidophilus and L. helveticus rarely use NNG in family-box (a set of synonymous) codons, in contrast to all other species. This result may be explained by assuming that L. acidophilus and L. helveticus, but not other species examined, use a single tRNA species for translation of family-box codons. Differences in expression level of genes are positively correlated with codon usage bias. Highly expressed genes show highly biased codon usage, whereas weakly expressed genes show much less biased codon usage. Codon usage patterns at the 5'-end of Lactobacillus genes is not significantly different from that of entire genes. The GC content of codons 2-6 is significantly reduced compared with that of the remainder of the gene. The possible implications of a reduced GC content for the control of translation efficiency are discussed.
TI  - Cloning and overexpression of Lactobacillus helveticus D-lactate dehydrogenase gene in Escherichia coli.
AB  - NAD(+)-dependent D-lactate dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus helveticus was purified to apparent homogeneity, and the sequence of the first 36 amino acid residues determined. Using forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers, based on the N-terminal sequence and amino acid residues 220-215 of the Lactobacillus bulgaricus enzyme [Kochhar, S., Hunziker, P. E., Leong-Morgenthaler, P. & Hottinger, H. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 8499-8513], a 0.6-kbp DNA fragment was amplified from L. helveticus genomic DNA by the polymerase chain reaction. This amplified DNA fragment was used as a probe to identify two recombinant clones containing the D-lactate dehydrogenase gene. Both plasmids overexpressed D-lactate dehydrogenase (greater than 60% total soluble cell protein) and were stable in Escherichia coli, compared to plasmids carrying the L. bulgaricus and Lactobacillus plantarum genes. The entire nucleotide sequence of the L. helveticus D-lactate dehydrogenase gene was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence indicated a polypeptide consisting of 336 amino acid residues, which showed significant amino acid sequence similarity to the recently identified family of D-2-hydroxy-acid dehydrogenases [Kochhar, S., Hunziker, P. E., Leong-Morgenthaler, P. & Hottinger, H. (1992) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 184, 60-66]. The physicochemical and catalytic properties of recombinant D-lactate dehydrogenase were identical to those of the wild-type enzyme, e.g. alpha 2 dimeric subunit structure, isoelectric pH, Km and Kcat for pyruvate and other 2-oxo-acid substrates. The kinetic profiles of 2-oxo-acid substrates showed some marked differences from that of L-lactate dehydrogenase, suggesting different mechanisms for substrate binding and specificity.
TI  - Single-stranded DNA plasmid, vector construction and cloning of Bacillus stearothermophilus alpha-amylase in Lactobacillus.
AB  - Vector plasmids were constructed by ligating chloramphenicol and erythromycin resistance genes to TaqI-digested DNA of a cryptic plasmid from Lactobacillus plantarum. The minimal region of Lactobacillus plasmid DNA that was required for DNA replication was defined and a single-stranded DNA intermediate replication system was observed. Homologies with other origins of replication of plasmids from Gram-positive bacteria, replicating via rolling circle mechanism, were found. It was shown that the constructed vectors, named pPSC20 and pPSC22, were transformable into L. plantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli. Using plasmid pPSC22, the alpha-amylase gene of Bacillus stearothermophilus was cloned and expressed in several Lactobacillus species.
TI  - Nucleic acids of species of Lactobacillus.
AB  - Nucleic acid composition of 17 cultures representing the type or neotype strains  of 15 named Lactobacillus species was studied. Nucleic acid characterization of these isolates was accompanied by a comparative study of conventional phenotypic reactions. The overall guanine plus cytosine mean deoxyribonucleic acid base composition ranged from 33 to 50% and genome sizes varied between 700 and 1500 X 10(6) daltons. Sporolactobacillus inulinus contained 2500 X 10(6) daltons of chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid and was therefore similar in size to members of the genus Bacillus. Deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization at a temperature 15 degrees C below the thermal melting temperature confirmed the extreme molecular heterogeneity of many species. The genus can be divided into three major groups, each containing four or more species based on a combination of nucleic acid characteristics and conventional phenotypic reactions. Group I (33 to 39% guanine plus cytosine) contains Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus helveticus nov. ssp. jugurt, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Lactobacillus sanfrancisco. Group II (42 to 48% guanine plus cytosine contains Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus brevis, and Group III (48 to 50% guanine plus cytosine) contains Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. leichmanii, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus fermentum nov. ssp. cellobiosis.
TI  - A Phylogenetic Analysis of Lactobacilli, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Leuconostoc  mesenteroides.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. helveticus, L. lactis, L. brevis, L. plantarum, L.  ruminis, L. casei, L. bifermentans, L. viridescens, L. fermentum, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Leuconostoc mesenteroides have been characterized by oligonucleotide cataloguing of their 16 S ribosomal RNAs. All Lactobacillus species investigated together with P. pentosaceus and L. mesenteroides form a phylogenetically coherent and ancient group. L. acidophilus and L. helveticus is the only closely related pair of species; all other species are only remotely related among each other, indicating that they are well-defined species. Lactobacillus, together with Streptococcus and Bacillus, constitute a super-cluster within the 'clostridium' sub-branch of Gram-positive eubacteria showing a low guanine plus cytosine content of their deoxyribonucleic acid.
TI  - Metabolism of pyruvate and citrate in lactobacilli.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. casei, L. delbrueckii , L. lactis and L. plantarum contained a pyruvate oxidase for the oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl phosphate and acetate. The presence of an acetate kinase converted the acetyl phosphate to acetate. L. casei and L. plantarum produced lactate and acetoin, in addition to acetate, under the conditions used while L. casei also produced diacetyl. L. casei and L. plantarum were the only species to utilize citrate. L. helveticus and L. helveticus subsp. jugurti did not utilize pyruvate under the conditions used.
TI  - [Bacteriocin typing of Lactobacillus cultures using a basic set of bacteriocinogenic strains].
AB  - Lactic bacilli of 15 species were divided into 78 bacteriocin types by their sensitivity spectra with respect to the main set of the bacteriocinogenic strains. L. acidophilus-L. salivarious, L. jugurti, L. casei, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. brevis, L. buchneri, L. helveticus, L. lactis and L. leichmannii were used in the study. The cultures were divided into 30, 9, 7, 25, 5, 20, 13, 8, 2.2 and 2 bacteriocin types respectively. The method of determining the lactic bacilli sensitivity spectra to 8 bacteriocinogenic strains of the main kit is simple and economic. It allows marking of lactic bacilli and their dividing into bacteriocin types within the species. This may be used in taxonomy and epidemiological studies.
TI  - [Sensitivity of lactobacilli of the subgenus Thermobacterium to the action of bacteriocins].
AB  - Sensitivity of 278 cultures of Thermobacterium to 30 types of bacteriocins produced by L. acidophilus, L. salivarius, L. jugurti, L. casei, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. brevis and L. buchneri was studied with the method of delayed antagonism. It was shown that all cultures of L. Salivarius, L. jugurti, L. helveticus, L. lactis, L. leichmannii, L. bulgaricus and L. delbrueckii and 94.1 per cent of L. acidophilus were sensitive to one or several bacteriocin types. The cultures of L. acidophilus, L. salivarius and L. jugurti, L. helveticus, L. lactis, L. bulgaricus and L. delbrueckii were sensitive to 26, 15, 28, 2 and 29 lactocin types respectively.
TI  - Multiple nutritional requirements of lactobacilli: genetic lesions affecting amino acid biosynthetic pathways.
AB  - Genetic lesions responsible for amino acid requirements in several species of multiple auxotrophic lactobacilli were investigated. Systematic attempts were made to isolate mutants that could grow in the absence of each of the amino acids required by the parental strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, L. casei, L. helveticus, and L. acidophilus. After treatment with appropriate mutagens, such mutants could be obtained with respect to many but not all required amino acids. Successful isolation of mutants for a given amino acid means that a minor genetic lesion reparable by single-step mutations affects its biosynthesis; a failure to isolate mutants suggests the involvement of more extensive lesions. Analysis of these results as well as the specific requirements exhibited by the parental strains revealed certain regularities; some of the biosynthetic pathways for individual amino acids were virtually unaffected by more extensive lesions in at least species tested, whereas others were affected by more extensive lesions in at least some species. Both the number and the kind of pathways affected by extensive lesions differed appreciably among different species. Furthermore, the growth response of the parental strains to some putative amino acid precursors revealed a clear correlation between the extent of genetic lesions and the occurrence and location of a genetic block(s) for a given pathway. These findings are discussed in relation to the phylogeny, ecology, and evolution of lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - [Sensitivity of the lactobacilli of the subgenus Streptobacterium to bacteriocins of lactobacilli of different species].
AB  - Sensitivity of 167 cultures of Lactobacilli of Streptobacterium to 39 bacteriocins produced by L. acidophilus, L. jugurti, L. salivarius, L. lactis, L. helveticus, L. casei, L. plantarum, L. fermenti, L. brevis and L. buchneri was studied. It was found that the cultures of L. casei were sensitive to 30 types of bacteriocins, while the cultures of L. plantarum were sensitive to 9 bacteriocin types. 89.6 per cent of the cultures of L. casei and all cultures of L. plantarum were sensitive to one or several bacteriocins produced by Lactobacilli of different species.
TI  - Phosphopantothenic acid--the major product of pantothenic acid accumulation and a significant growth stimulatn in Lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  - Non-proliferating cells of Lactobacillus plantarum accumulated about 1.3 mug of pantothenic acid (PA) per milligram dry cells when placed in a phosphate-buffered solution containing glucose, NaCl, and PA for 21 h. Under the conditions applied for PA uptake, pH 7.5 and 38 degrees C, the accumulated PA existed almost exclusively in a bound form. Free PA was observed only occasionally and then at questionably significant levels. All bound PA was released quantitatively by enzyme hydrolysis with alkaline (intestinal) phosphatase. Chromatographic analysis coupled with differential microbiological analysis of cell extracts using Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Lactobacillus helveticus, and L. plantarum identified the accumulated PA as phosphopantothenic acid (P-PA). Assay of P-PA loaded cell extracts (devoid of free PA) by L. plantarum before and after alkaline phosphatase hydrolysis showed that the growth of this primary assay organism was stimulated by 8.3%.
TI  - Pure Culture Fermentation of Brined Cucumbers.
AB  - The relative abilities of Pediococcus cerevisiae, Lactobacillus plantarum, L. brevis, and several other species of lactic acid bacteria to grow and produce acid in brined cucumbers were evaluated in pure culture fermentations. Such fermentations were made possibly by the use of two techniques, gamma radiation (0.83 to 1.00 Mrad) and hot-water blanching (66 to 80 C for 5 min), designed first to rid the cucumbers of naturally occurring, interfering, and competitive microbial groups prior to brining, followed by inoculation with the desired lactic acid bacteria. Of the nine species tested, strains of the three common to cucumber fermentations, P. cerevisiae, L. plantarum, and L. brevis, grew to the highest populations, and produced the highest levels of brine acidity and the lowest pH values in fermentations at 5.4 to 5.6% NaCl by weight; also, their sequence of active development in fermentations, with the use of a three-species mixture for inoculation, was in the species order just named. This sequence of occurrence was similar to that estimated by others for natural fermentations. The rates of growth and acid production in fermentations with a mixture of P. cerevisiae, L. plantarum, and L. brevis increased as the incubation temperature was increased from 21 to 27 to 32 C; however, the maximal populations and acidities attained were essentially the same for fermentations at each temperature. Further, these same three species were found to be the most salt tolerant of those tested; their upper limit for appreciable growth and measurable acid production was about 8% salt, whereas thermophilic species such as L. thermophilus, L. lactis, L. helveticus, L. fermenti, and L. delbrueckii exhibited a much lower salt tolerance, ranging from about 2.5 to 4.0%. However, certain strains of L. delbrueckii grew very rapidly in cucumbers brined at 2.5 to 3.0% salt, and produced sufficient acid in about 30 hr at 48 C to reduce the brine pH from above 7.0 to below 4.0. An inexpensive, pure culture fermentor which was suitable for gamma radiation, resistant to salt and acid, and which permitted repeated aseptic sampling of the fermenting brine, is illustrated and the specifications are given.
