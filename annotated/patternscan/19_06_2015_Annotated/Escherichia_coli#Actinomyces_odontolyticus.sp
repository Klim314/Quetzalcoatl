TI  == the rising tide of bloodstream infections with actinomyces species: bimicrobial infection with actinomyces odontolyticus and escherichia coli in an intravenous drug user.
AB  == clinicians of all specialties need to be aware of a recent, nationwide increase in the number of actinomyces bloodstream infections. we report a case of bimicrobial bloodstream infection with actinomyces odontolyticus and escherichia  coli in an intravenous drug user. a 36-year-old, male intravenous drug user was admitted with acute-onset pleuritic chest pain, back pain, pyrexia, tachycardia,  tachypnoea and hypotension. chest ct showed multiple, bilateral, cavitating lung  lesions, most likely the result of septic emboli originating from an infected deep venous thrombosis (dvt). blood cultures led to a mixed growth of a. odontolyticus, identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (maldi-tof), and e. coli. the rising tide of bloodstream infections with actinomyces species is likely to continue with the increasing availability of sophisticated molecular identification techniques, including maldi-tof. in this case, the results of antimicrobial susceptibility tests were particularly important because the e. coli was susceptible to ciprofloxacin, whereas the a. odontolyticus was resistant.

TI  == comparison of the gut microbiota of people in france and saudi arabia.
AB  == background/objectives: the gut microbiota contributes to energy acquisition from  food, and changes in the gut microbiome are associated with obesity. the eating habits of saudis are much different than those of europeans, and our objective was to compare the fecal microbiota of obese and normal weight saudis and french. subjects/methods: illumina miseq deep sequencing was used to test the gut microbiota of 9 normal weight and 9 obese individuals from saudi arabia and 16 normal weight and 12 obese individuals from france. results: obese french possessed significantly more relative proteobacteria (p=0.002) and bacteroidetes  (p=0.05) and had lower richness and biodiversity at all the operational taxonomic unit (otu) cutoffs (p<0.05) than normal weight french. obese saudis possessed significantly more firmicutes (p=0.001) without a difference in richness (p=0.2)  and biodiversity (p=0.3) compared with normal weight saudis. we found a common bacterial species core of 23 species existing in 50% of obese and normal weight saudis and 29 species in 50% of obese and normal weight french. actinomyces odontolyticus, escherichia coli and ruminococcus obeum were present in at least 50% of all individuals tested. french individuals had significantly higher richness and biodiversity compared with saudis at all the otu cutoffs (p<0.05). conclusion: microbiota differences between obese and normal weight french were not similar to those between obese and normal weight saudis. the studies of different populations can result in contrasting data regarding the associations of the gut microbiota and obesity.

TI  == [actinomyces odontolyticus isolation during prosthetic aortic graft infection with paraprosthetic duodenal fistula].
AB  == introduction: prosthetic vascular graft infection is a rare complication of vascular surgery. we report a case with graft enteric fistula and actinomyces odontolyticus bacteremia. exegesis: a 73 year-old man with a prosthetic aortic graft and who had a parodontal disease, has been hospitalised for fever of unknown origin. blood cultures grew with escherichia coli and actinomyces odontolyticus. the imaging studies indicated graft infection. laparotomy has confirmed the diagnosis and highlighted a polymicrobial infection and a paraprosthetic duodenal fistula. a review of the literature's data concerning prosthetic vascular graft infections is made. the role of actinomyces odontolyticus in that case is discussed. conclusion: prosthetic aortic graft infection due to graft enteric fistula is usually a polymicrobial infection and is a late complication of aortic surgery. imaging is essential for the diagnosis  of prosthetic aortic graft infection. it is possible that actinomyces odontolyticus has contributed to prosthesis infection in this case.

TI  == the effects of chlorhexidine gluconate (0.12%) on the antimicrobial properties of tooth-colored proroot mineral trioxide aggregate.
AB  == the purpose of this in vitro study was to determine whether the substitution of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for sterile water as a mixing agent would enhance the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored proroot mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) against actinomyces odontolyticus (atcc17982), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc2586), streptococcus sanguis (atcc10556), enterococcus faecalis (er3/2s), escherichia coli (sm10lambdapir), staphylococcus aureus (atcc6538), pseudomonas aeruginosa (ume), and candida albicans (atcc10261). two wells of 5-mm diameter were made in triplicate agar plates inoculated with standardized suspensions of each microorganism. mta (33 mg) mixed with chlorhexidine (12 microl) or sterile water (12 microl) was placed to fill each well. plates were incubated at 37 degrees c as required for microbial growth. a blinded, independent observer measured zones of inhibition. all mta samples inhibited microbial growth regardless of mixing agent. mta/chlorhexidine showed significantly larger zones of inhibition (p < 0.0002, paired t test). in conclusion, substituting 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for water enhanced the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored proroot mta.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of 'mgp' gutta-percha in vitro.
AB  == aim: to determine whether 'mgp' gutta-percha (westport, ct, usa), a commercially  available gutta-percha containing iodoform, inhibits the growth of potential endodontic pathogens. methodology: inocula of enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus sanguis, fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces odontolyticus were spread onto the surface of agar plates. 'mgp' gutta-percha cones presoaked in sterile water were transferred to the inoculated agar and incubated at 37 degrees c aerobically or anaerobically as required for optimal growth. identical studies were performed using iodoform-free gutta-percha and sterile paper disks saturated with 10% povidone-iodine. following incubation, zones of inhibition around the 'mgp' gutta-percha, iodoform-free gutta-percha and disks were evaluated. results: povidone-iodine inhibited all the strains. iodoform-free gutta-percha inhibited s. sanguis and a. odontolyticus. 'mgp' gutta-percha inhibited s. aureus, s. sanguis, a. odontolyticus and f. nucleatum. neither iodoform-free gutta-percha nor 'mgp' gutta-percha inhibited growth of e. faecalis, e. coli or p. aeruginosa. conclusions: compared to iodoform-free gutta-percha, iodoform-containing 'mgp' gutta-percha had an inhibitory effect in vitro on s. aureus and f. nucleatum, but not on e. faecalis, e. coli or p. aeruginosa.

TI  == an evaluation of the action of different root canal irrigants on facultative aerobic-anaerobic, obligate anaerobic, and microaerophilic bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to test the effect of different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, and cetrimide on the following bacterial strains: facultative aerobes-anaerobes: candida albicans atcc 10231; enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212; escherichia coli atcc 25,922; pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27,853; streptococcus mitis atcc 9811; streptococcus mutans atcc 35668; streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419; and streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556. microaerophiles: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans atcc 29522. obligate anaerobes: actinomyces odontolyticus atcc 17929; fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25,586; porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277; and prevotella melaninogenica atcc 25845. each irrigant was kept in contact with the bacterial species used for the  experiment for 10, 20, or 30 min. results showed that all irrigants had a bactericidal effect on both facultative aerobes-anaerobes and on microaerophilic  and obligate anaerobic strains, in all concentrations and even after short periods of contact.
