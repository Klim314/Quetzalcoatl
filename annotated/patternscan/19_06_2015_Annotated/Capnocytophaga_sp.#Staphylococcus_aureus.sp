TI  == demographic study of expulsive hemorrhages in 3 patients with infectious keratitis.
AB  == purpose: to investigate the demography, causative bacteria, and clinical findings in 3 patients with expulsive hemorrhage. methods: the clinical records of 3 patients (3 eyes), who developed expulsive hemorrhage because of infectious keratitis and were treated at our hospital between december 2006 and january 2008, were investigated retrospectively. results: three women, older than 70 years, with physical and mental disabilities because of senile dementia were studied. two were residents at a nursing home. basic corneal disorders included bullous keratopathy, cicatricial syphilitic keratitis, and traumatic keratitis because of a foreign body. all patients developed expulsive hemorrhage. two patients underwent enucleation, and 1 underwent bulbar exenteration with sclerocorneal patch for expulsive hemorrhage. bacterial culture in these cases isolated either capnocytophaga sp. and penicillin-intermediate resistant streptococcus pneumoniae or methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. conclusions: this is the first recorded case of capnocytophaga keratitis in japan. patients with dementia may develop severe ocular complications after infectious keratitis because of their inability to communicate.

TI  == skin microflora and bacterial infections of the skin.
AB  == the skin is a milieu for controlled bacterial growth. skin supports the growth of commensal bacteria, which protect the host from pathogenic bacteria. environmental and local factors, host immunity, and organism adherence and virulence are intricately related to cutaneous infection. resident gram-positive  bacteria include staphylococcus, micrococcus, and corynebacterium sp. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes are notoriously pathogenic in the skin. in order for bacteria to be pathogenic, they must be able to adhere to, grow on, and invade the host. bacteria possess numerous virulence genes that allow for growth in these privileged niches. epidermal infections caused by s. aureus and s. pyogenes include impetigo and ecthyma. dermal infections consist of erysipelas, cellulitis, and necrotizing fasciitis. the pilosebaceous unit is involved in folliculitis, furunculosis, and carbunculosis. moreover, s. aureus and s. pyogenes produce toxins that may elicit a superantigen response, causing massive release of cytokines. staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, toxic shock syndrome, and scarlet fever are all superantigen-mediated. gram-negative organisms such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, pasteurella multocida, capnocytophaga canimorsus, bartonella sp., klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, and vibrio vulnificus are not typical resident skin microflora but may cause cutaneous infection.

TI  == microbial keratitis in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.
AB  == background: posterior segment complications of systemic infection with the human  immunodeficiency virus (hiv) are well recognized. the anterior segment complications often are, however, overlooked. the author treated 20 episodes of nonherpetic infectious keratitis in 17 eyes of 13 patients infected with hiv who  presented between august 1990 and may 1994. methods: review of records. results:  nine patients were women, and four were men. mean age was 35.2 years. the keratitis was bilateral in four patients, polymicrobial in four, and recurrent in two. the most common infecting organism was candida albicans (5 eyes), a rare cause of keratitis in immunocompetent individuals. other organisms included staphylococcus aureus in four eyes, staphylococcus epidermidis in four, bacillus  sp in two, and one each pseudomonas aeruginosa, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, micrococcus sp, and capnocytophaga sp. seven eyes retained 20/30 or better visual acuity after treatment, eight had visual acuity of 20/50 or worse, and two were eviscerated. classic predisposing factors for infectious keratitis were found in  only two patients and included contact lens wear and atopy in one patient each. twelve patients had a history of intravenous drug abuse. conclusion: infectious keratitis should be recognized as a complication of systemic hiv infection, especially in the context of drug abuse. the prognosis for recovery of vision in  these patients often is poor.
