TI  == cleanliness of linen and clothing items professionally laundered or dry-cleaned.
AB  == we asked 14 professional cleaners (laundry services) to clean various unused (new) linen and clothing items with a microbial contamination level of < 1 colony-forming units (cfu)/cm2 and then evaluated the bacterial/fungal contamination of the laundered or dry-cleaned items. after laundering, 6 (21.4%)  of 28 samples from 4 of the 14 cleaners (28.5%) were contaminated (1-1,200 cfu/cm2). after dry-cleaning, 2 (7.1%) of 28 samples from 2 (14.3%) of the 14 cleaners were contaminated (7-10 cfu/cm2). the main contaminant was bacillus cereus. no sample of the laundered or dry-cleaned items showed staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, or pseudomonas aeruginosa contamination. all 14 cleaners investigated in this study used batch-type washing machines. therefore,  batch-type washing machines can cause the contamination of linens and clothing items with b. cereus.

TI  == kinetics of bacterial inactivation by 405nm and 520nm light emitting diodes and the role of endogenous coproporphyrin on bacterial susceptibility.
AB  == photodynamic inactivation studies of microbial pathogens have focused on the use  of an external photosensitizer or a precursor compound to eliminate bacteria. the present study investigated the inactivation kinetics of six bacterial pathogens by a 405nm light emitting diode (led) without the addition of any external compound. the role of endogenous coproporphyrin on the bacterial susceptibility to leds was also examined. pathogens were illuminated with leds at 25, 10 and 4 degrees c for 9h and the inactivation curves were modeled using six different equations. endogenous coproporphyrin was quantified using an hplc system equipped with a fluorescence detector. at a dose of 306j/cm2, the 405nm led brought about  4.0, 2.1 and 1.9 log reductions in the populations of staphylococcus aureus at 25, 10 and 4 degrees c, respectively. at all three temperatures, the population of bacillus cereus and listeria monocytogenes reduced by approximately 2.3 and 1.9 log respectively. salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli o157:h7 showed  moderate susceptibility to 405nm led while pseudomonas aeruginosa was most resistant. of the six models tested, hom model proved most suitable. this study demonstrated that 405nm leds can be useful in the inactivation of bacterial pathogens with the aid of endogenous coproporphyrin alone.

TI  == secondary metabolites of seseli rigidum: chemical composition plus antioxidant, antimicrobial and cholinesterase inhibition activity.
AB  == extracts of different polarity obtained from various plant parts (root, leaf, flower and fruit) of seseli rigidum were studied by different antioxidant assays: dpph and abts radical scavenging activity, by total reducing power method as well as via total content of flavonoids and polyphenols. essential oils of all plant parts showed weak antioxidant characteristics. the inhibitory concentration range of the tested extracts, against bacteria escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and fungi candida albicans and aspergillus niger was 0.01-1.50mg/ml and of a microbicidal 0.02-3.00mg/ml. in the interaction with cholinesterase, all essential oils proved effective as inhibitors. the highest percentage of inhibition versus human and horse cholinesterase was shown by root essential oil (38.20% and 48.30%, respectively)  among oils, and root hexane extract (40.56% and 50.65% respectively). essential oils and volatile components of all plant parts were identified by gc, gc-ms and  headspace/gc-ms. statistical analysis of the ensemble of results showed that the  root essential oil composition differed significantly from essential oils of other parts of the plant. taking into account all of the studied activities, the  root hexane extract showed the best overall properties. by means of high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry, the 30 most abundant constituents were identified in extracts of different polarity. the presence of identified constituents was linked to observed specific biological activities, thus designating compounds potentially responsible for each exhibited activity.

TI  == purification and characterization of a novel plantaricin, kl-1y, from lactobacillus plantarum kl-1.
AB  == three bacteriocins from lactobacillus plantarum kl-1 were successfully purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase hplc. the bacteriocin peptides kl-1x, -1y and -1z had molecular masses of 3053.82, 3498.16 and 3533.16 da, respectively. all three peptides were  stable at ph 2-12 and 25 degrees c and at high temperatures of 80 and 100 degrees c for 30 min and 121 degrees c for 15 min. however, they differed in their susceptibility to proteolytic enzymes and their inhibition spectra. kl-1y showed  broad inhibitory activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis dmst 17368, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 15442, p. aeruginosa atcc 9027, escherichia coli o157:h7 and e. coli atcc 8739. kl-1x and -1z inhibited only gram-positive bacteria. kl-1x, kl-1y and kl-1z exhibited synergistic activity. the successful amino acid sequencing of kl-1y had a hydrophobicity of approximately 30 % and no cysteine residues suggested its novelty, and it was designated "plantaricin kl-1y". plantaricin kl-1y exhibited bactericidal activity against bacillus cereus jcm 2152(t). compared to nisin, kl-1y displayed broad inhibitory activities of 200, 800, 1600, 800, 400 and 400 au/ml against the growth of bacillus coagulans jcm 2257(t), b. cereus jcm 2152(t), listeria innocua atcc 33090(t), staphylococcus aureus tistr 118, e. coli o157:h7 and e. coli atcc 8739, respectively, whereas nisin had similar activities against only b. coagulans jcm 2257(t) and b. cereus jcm 2152(t). therefore, the novel plantaricin kl-1y is a promising antimicrobial substance for food safety uses in the future.

TI  == distinguishing the dominant species of pathogen in maxillary sinusitis by sequencing dna dataset analysis.
AB  == this study determined the microbial composition in maxillary sinusitis and determined the predominant fungal and bacterial species. samples were obtained from 11 patients with fungal sinusitis and 2 healthy patients. the 13 samples were sequenced using an illumina hi-seq 2000, and mapping to the human, bacterial, and the fungal genomes were based on several steps. bioinformatics and statistical analyses were then performed for bacterial and fungal expressions in  the samples. all samples were cultures for fungal growth. the sequencing data revealed that aspergillus flavus and aspergillus oryzae were the dominant fungal  strains in the rhinosinusitis samples, and bacillus cereus and bacillus thuringiensis were the dominant bacterial strains. indeed, the fungi and bacteria were associated with the development of fungal rhinosinusitis. furthermore, b. cereus and b. thuringiensis may cooperate with pseudomonas aeruginosa to inhibit  the growth of fungal mycelia. knowledge of the microbial composition can provide  a diagnostic reference for patients with maxillary sinusitis.

TI  == [specific bacterial diversity in bats of different food guilds in southern sierra oaxaca, mexico].
AB  == specific bacterial diversity in bats of different food guilds in southern sierra  oaxaca, mexico. bats have different ecologic roles in variable ecosystems that have been already described. they have been linked to several zoonoses, however little is known about the relationship between bat microbiota and their diet, and studies on the bacterial ecology of the microbiota in bats are limited. to contribute with the description of this important interaction between microbiota  and host, the aim of this work was to characterize the composition and bacterial  diversity in the oral and anal regions of 10 species of bats, in relation to food guild. for this monthly samplings were conducted using four mist nets (19:00-24:00h) from february to october 2012; nets were reviewed every 45 minutes. each captured organism was sampled in the oral and anal cavities with sterile swabs; these were placed in pre-enrichment media and stored at 4 degrees  c. bacterial samples were studied which through selective media, chromogenic and  biochemical tests. we obtained samples from 502 frugivorous, 29 hematophagous and 11 nectivorous bats. we found a total of 26 bacterial species, with the predominant phylum proteobacteria and the family enterobacteriaceae. statistically significant differences were observed between oral and anal microhabitats: frugivorous (t = -3.516, g.1 = 14.761, p = 0.003), hematophagous (t = -3.320, g.l = 19.262, p = 0.003), and nectivorous (t = -2.497, g.l = 11.933, p = 0.026), and in some guilds [frugivorous and nectivorous in the anal region (t = 2.274, g.l = 29.660, p = 0.030), hematophagous and nectivorous anal region (t = 2.077, g.l = 29.904, p = 0.049)]. it was also shown that there is bacteria specificity in some guilds such as nectivorous and frugivorous with bacillus cereus, b. sp. x. sp., as well as, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermis, aeromonas hydrophyla in hematophagous. bacterial presence can be explained by the type of diet and/or by transfer of bacteria from their preys. these bacteria may be indigenous to these bats and play the role of mutual benefit, providing the host with stable growth conditions and supplemental nutrients, while the microbiota contributes to host nutrition, development of the immune system, stabilization of the microbial population and to avoid pathogens colonization. by understanding the importance of the relation- ship between host and its bacterial populations, the conservation efforts being made to protect species such as bats may be improved.

TI  == biogenic silver and gold nanoparticles synthesized using red ginseng root extract, and their applications.
AB  == in the present study, we report a green methodology for the synthesis of silver and gold nanoparticles, using the root extract of the herbal medicinal plant korean red ginseng. the silver and gold nanoparticles were synthesized within 1 h and 10 min respectively. the nanoparticles generated were not aggregated, and remained stable for a long time, which suggests the nature of nanoparticles. the  phytochemicals and ginsenosides present in the root extract assist in reducing and stabilizing the synthesized nanoparticles. the red ginseng root extract-generated silver nanoparticles exhibit antimicrobial activity against pathogenic microorganisms including vibrio parahaemolyticus, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and candida albicans. in addition, the silver nanoparticles exhibit biofilm degrading activity against s. aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. thus, the present study opens up a new possibility of synthesizing silver and gold nanoparticles in a green and rapid manner using korean red ginseng root extract, and explores their biomedical applications.

TI  == improved in vitro assay for determining the mucin adherence of bacteria sensitive to triton x-100 treatment.
AB  == mucin-associated microbiota are in relatively close contact with the intestinal epithelium and may thus have a more pronounced effect on host health. we have previously developed a simple mucin agar assay to simulate initial mucus colonization by intestinal microbial communities. adherence of microbiota was estimated using flow cytometry after detachment with triton x-100. in this study, the effect of this detergent on the cultivability of both virulent and commensal  strains was investigated. mucin attachment of selected strains was evaluated using the mucin adhesion assay. bacteria were dislodged from the mucin surface by incubation with triton or from the whole mucin agar layer using a stomacher. mechanical extraction resulted in 1.24 +/- 0.42, 2.69 +/- 0.44, and 1.56 +/- 0.85 log cfu/ml higher plate counts of lactobacillus rhamnosus, bacillus cereus, and escherichia coli strains, respectively, than the chemical method. the sensitivity of bacteria to triton varied among microbial species and strains. among others, triton inhibited the growth of salmonella enterica lmg 10396 and pseudomonas aeruginosa lmg 8029 on laboratory media, although these bacteria maintained their viability during this treatment. only gram-positive strains, enterococcus hirae lmg 6399 and l. rhamnosus gg, were not affected by this detergent. therefore, the mechanical method is recommended for the extraction of mucin-adhered bacteria that are sensitive to triton, especially when followed by traditional cultivation techniques. however, this approach can also be recommended for strains that are not affected by this detergent, because it resulted in higher recovery of adhered l. rhamnosus gg compared to the chemical extraction.

TI  == chemical composition and biological activity of pulicaria vulgaris essential oil  from iran.
AB  == the present study investigated the chemical composition of the essential oil (eo) from aerial parts (flowering stage) of pulicaria vulgaris gaertn. by gc-ms. also, the antimicrobial activity of the eo against gram-positive bacteria (bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus), gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and fungi (aspergillus niger and candida albicans) was tested. in total, 23 compounds were recognized, accounting for 98.08% of the eo.  the main compounds in the eo were thymol (50.22%), p-menth-6-en-2-one (carvotanacetone, 20.2%), thymol isobutyrate (16.88%), menthan-2-one (4.31%), 1-methyl-1,2-propanedione (4.13%), 2,5-dimethoxy-p-cymene (4.01%), myrtenol (1.22%), linalool (1.1%), and beta-myrcene (1.9%). results of antibacterial test  of p. vulgaris essential oil showed that all assayed concentrations significantly inhibited the growth of b. cereus, s. aureus, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa at p < 0.05. mic for b. cereus, s. aureus, e. coli, p. aeruginosa was 17.5, 25.2, 19.4 and 33.2 mug/ml respectively; antifungal screening of the essential oil of p. vulgaris showed that the oil significantly inhibited the growth of a. niger and c. albicans (mic = 15.5 and 9.9 mug/ml, respectively). results of cytotoxicity assay showed that the essential oil exhibited a significant cytotoxic activity against both cell lines. in case of mcf-7 and hep-g2 cell lines, ic50 of the essential oil were 5.36 and 7.16 mug/ml, respectively. the potent antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of the eo may be attributed to its high contents of thymol, carvotanacetone and thymol isobutyrate. antimicrobial and antitumor chemotherapies are showing diminishing effectiveness because of emergence of drug-resistance. hence, using efficient natural chemotherapeutic agents such as pulicaria vulgaris essential oil with fewer side effects is an encouraging approach to fight cancer and infectious diseases in medicine, agriculture, food science and related fields.

AB  == the present study aimed to synthesis silver nanoparticles (agnps) in a greener route using aqueous latex extract of calotropis gigantea l. toward biomedical applications. initially, synthesis of agnps was confirmed through uv-vis spectroscopy which shows the surface plasmonic resonance peak (spr) at 420 nm. fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir) analysis provides clear evidence that protein fractions present in the latex extract act as reducing and stabilizing bio agents. energy dispersive x-ray (edax) spectroscopy confirms the  presence of silver as a major constituent element. x-ray diffractograms displays  that the synthesized agnps were biphasic crystalline nature. electron microscopic studies such as field emission scanning electron microscopic (fe-sem) and transmission electron microscope (tem) reveals that synthesized agnps are spherical in shape with the size range between 5 and 30 nm. further, crude latex  aqueous extract and synthesized agnps were evaluated against different bacterial  pathogens such as bacillus cereus, enterococci sp, shigella sp, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. compared to the crude latex aqueous extract, biosynthesized agnps exhibits a remarkable antimicrobial activity. likewise in vitro anticancer study manifests the cytotoxicity value of synthesized agnps against tested hela cells. the output of this study clearly suggesting that biosynthesized agnps using latex of c. gigantea can be used as promising nanomaterial for therapeutic application in context with nanodrug formulation.

TI  == phospholipase c from pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus cereus; characterization of catalytic activity.
AB  == objective: to study characteristics of phospholipases c (plcs), their importance  for producing microorganisms as well as the potential of their use for industrial purposes. method: plc from bacillus cereus (b. cereus) d101 was selected as an example of gram-positive plcs and plc from pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa) d183 of gram-negative ones. enzymes were partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by membrane dialysis. partially purified preparations were used to study effect of different factors on activities as well as in substrate specificity tests which were conducted using a turbidimetric assay method. results: maximum activity was at ph 7 and 8 and 40 degrees c for p. aeruginosa plc, and ph 8-10 and 37 degrees c for b. cereus plc. both plcs were inhibited by  pi at 5 mm or higher, whereas, plc from b. cereus only was inhibited by edta. activity of p. aeruginosa plc was not affected by removing zn(2+) ions from reaction mixture or their replacement with ca(2+), ba(2+), mg(2+) or mn(2+) ions. vis-a-vis, activity of b. cereus plc was found to be metal ion dependent. plcs from both isolates were relatively thermostable and showed maximum affinity toward phosphatidylcholine. sphingomyelin and phosphatidylethanolamine were not good substrates and phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin could be considered non-substrates. conclusion: human body physiological conditions could favor activity of p. aeruginosa and b. cereus plcs. these enzymes may participate in phosphate scavenging and virulence of producing isolates but not in autolysis. plcs from both isolates are potential candidates for industrial use.

TI  == pharmacological basis for the medicinal use of linum usitatissimum (flaxseed) in  infectious and non-infectious diarrhea.
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: linum usitatissimum, commonly known as flaxseed has traditionally been used for the management of diarrhea and gastrointestinal infections. this study was planned to assess pharmacological basis for the medicinal use of flaxseed in infectious and non-infectious diarrhea. materials and methods: the crude aqueous-methanolic extract of flaxseed was studied using the in vivo castor oil-induced diarrhea, gut motility and enteropooling assays. mechanistic basis was further elucidated by testing the inhibitory effect on spontaneously contracting isolated rabbit jejunum preparations, suspended in a 10ml tissue bath containing tyrode solution, maintained at 37 degrees c and aerated with carbogen. antibacterial efficacy of the flaxseed extract was tested  against different enteric and non-enteric pathogenic bacteria using in vitro antibacterial assays. results: flaxseed extract reduced the diarrheal score in mice, by 39%, 63.90% and 68.34% at the respective doses of 100, 300 and 500mg/kg. intestinal secretions were reduced by 24.12%, 28.09% and 38.80%, whereas the intestinal motility was reduced by 31.66%, 46.98% and 56.20% at respective doses  of 100, 300 and 500mg/kg. when tested on isolated rabbit jejunum preparations, flaxseed extract produced a dose-dependent inhibition of both spontaneous and high k(+) (80mm)-induced contractions, and shifted the concentration-response curves of ca(++) to the right with suppression of the maximum response, similar to that caused by verapamil. flaxseed extract was found to possess bactericidal activity at the tested concentrations of 12.5mg/ml, against vancomycin-resistant  enterococcus faecalis (100%), escherichia coli k1 (88.88%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (98.76%), bacillus cereus (92.64%), pseudomonas aeruginosa  (76.83%) and salmonella typhi (26.91+/-3.35%). the concentration of 10mg/ml showed bactericidal effects against all the aforementioned pathogens except escherichia coli k1, whereas for pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhi, it  was bacteriostatic at this concentration. conclusions: our results indicate that  linum usitatissimum (flaxseed) extract exhibits antidiarrheal and antispasmodic activities by virtue of its antimotility and antisecretory effects which are mediated possibly through inhibition of ca(++) channels, though additional mechanism(s) cannot be ruled out. flaxseed extract proved effective against both  enteric and non-enteric pathogens causing diarrhea, thus ensuring wide coverage and rationalizing its medicinal use in both the infectious and non-infectious diarrhea.

TI  == development of biopolymer nanocomposite for silver nanoparticles and ciprofloxacin controlled release.
AB  == screening of biopolymeric gel beads containing silver nanoparticles (ag-nps) stabilized in guar gum alkyl amine (ggaa) and ciprofloxacin (cip) was carried out in order to obtain a novel nanocomposite with controlled release profile of both  antimicrobians. the selected matrix composed of alginate/high methoxyl pectin (hmp)/ggaa (4:4:1) was able to co-incorporate ag-nps and cip with encapsulation efficiency higher than 70%. sem images revealed good cohesivity and compatibility between the biopolymers and the cargos. beads provided protection against ag-nps  degradation at acidic phs and hmp would played a key role providing hydrophobic regions. while cip release profile showed a ph independent diffusional process, ag-nps release was restricted to matrix erodability. calcium quelating agents and/or alginate degrading enzymes could modulate the release profile. the bactericidal activity of beads was tested in liquid medium, showing cooperative effects between the antimicrobials against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus. tem images confirmed interaction of ag-nps with bacterial surfaces followed by membrane damage. results suggested  the nanocomposite matrix as a promising system for oral treatment of intestinal infectious diseases caused by multidrug resistant and unknown microorganisms, since both cip and ag-nps would be able to reach intestine in the active form.

TI  == unsaturated fatty acid, cis-2-decenoic acid, in combination with disinfectants or antibiotics removes pre-established biofilms formed by food-related bacteria.
AB  == biofilm formation by food-related bacteria and food-related pathogenesis are significant problems in the food industry. even though much disinfection and mechanical procedure exist for removal of biofilms, they may fail to eliminate pre-established biofilms. cis-2 decenoic acid (cda), an unsaturated fatty acid messenger produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa, is reportedly capable of inducing the dispersion of established biofilms by multiple types of microorganisms. however, whether cda has potential to boost the actions of certain antimicrobials is unknown. here, the activity of cda as an inducer of pre-established biofilms dispersal, formed by four main food pathogens; staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, salmonella enterica and e. coli, was measured using both semi-batch and continuous cultures bioassays. to assess the ability of cda combined biocides treatments to remove pre-established biofilms formed on stainless steel discs, cfu counts were performed for both treated and untreated cultures. eradication of the biofilms by cda combined antibiotics was evaluated using crystal violet staining. the effect of cda combined treatments (antibiotics and disinfectants) on biofilm surface area and bacteria viability was evaluated using fluorescence microscopy, digital image analysis and live/dead staining. mics were also determined to assess the probable inhibitory effects of cda combined treatments on the growth of tested microorganisms' planktonic cells. treatment of pre-established biofilms with only 310 nm cda resulted in at least two-fold increase in the number of planktonic cells in all cultures. while antibiotics or  disinfectants alone exerted a trivial effect on cfu counts and percentage of surface area covered by the biofilms, combinational treatments with both 310 nm cda and antibiotics or disinfectants led to approximate 80% reduction in biofilm  biomass. these data suggests that combined treatments with cda would pave the way toward developing new strategies to control biofilms with widespread applications in industry as well as medicine.

TI  == role of structural changes induced in biological membranes by hydrolysable tannins from sumac leaves (rhus typhina l.) in their antihemolytic and antibacterial effects.
AB  == in this study, we found that the sumac tannins (rhus typhina l.) exert to a various extent antihemolytic effects and antibacterial activity against bacillus  cereus and pseudomonas aeruginosa depending on structural specificity of bacteria and different mechanisms of their toxic action. the sumac tannins exert the most  expressed activity against b. cereus. the antihemolytic effect of the sumac tannins seems to be connected to a greater extent with their modifying action on  the erythrocyte membrane structure. it was found that the sumac tannins are incorporated into the erythrocyte membrane, causing transformation of discocytes  into echinocytes and enhancing the rigidity of the hydrophilic region of the lipid bilayer. we suggest that the embedding of sumac tannins into the membrane of erythrocytes alters their physical properties and, as a consequence, can limit their interaction with bacterial toxins.

TI  == phytochemistry and preliminary assessment of the antibacterial activity of chloroform extract of amburana cearensis (allemao) a.c. sm. against klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing strains.
AB  == the chloroform extract of the stem bark of amburana cearensis was chemically characterized and tested for antibacterial activity.the extract was analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. the main compounds identified were 4-methoxy-3-methylphenol (76.7%), triciclene (3.9%), alpha -pinene (1.0%), beta -pinene (2.2%), and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (3.1%). preliminary antibacterial tests were carried out against species of distinct morphophysiological characteristics: escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and bacillus cereus. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determinate in 96-well microplates for the chloroform extract and an analogue of themain compound identified, which  was purchased commercially.we have shown that plant's extract was only inhibitory (but not bactericidal) at the maximum concentration of 6900 mu g/ml against pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus cereus. conversely, the analogue 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol produced mics ranging from215 to 431 mu g/ml against all bacterial species.new antibacterial assays conducted with such chemical compound  against klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing strains have shown similarmicresults and minimumbactericidal concentration (mbc) of 431 mu g/ml.we conclude that a. cearensis is a good source of methoxy-methylphenol compounds,which could be screened for antibacterial activity againstmultiresistant bacteria fromdifferent species.

TI  == antibacterial activities and in vitro anti-inflammatory (membrane stability) properties of methanolic extracts of gardenia coronaria leaves.
AB  == this work is carried out with gardenia coronaria leaves that belong to the family rubiaceae, which is a small-to-medium-sized but tall, deciduous tree, 7.6-9 m high on an average. leaves are used for the treatment of rheumatic pain and bronchitis. the leaf of the plant consists of coronalolide, coronalolic acid, coronalolide methyl ester, ethyl coronalolate acetate triterpenes (secocycloartanes), and so forth. methanol extract from the leaves of gardenia coronaria was completely screened for membrane stability and antibacterial activity. the lower concentrations of methanolic leaf extract of gardenia coronaria gave good antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity, but higher concentrations gave relatively more projecting antibacterial activity in vitro as compared with kanamycin. the crude drug's anti-inflammatory effects were compared with those of aspirin as positive control. the methanolic extracts of gardenia coronaria leaves possessed a broad spectrum antibacterial activity against a variety of both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms like streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus cereus, shigella sonnei, shigella boydii, and proteus mirabilis, with a zone of inhibition from 10 to 16 mm. the extract also showed good membrane stability to be considered as having significant anti-inflammatory action.

TI  == tuning the biological activity profile of antibacterial polymers via subunit substitution pattern.
AB  == binary nylon-3 copolymers containing cationic and hydrophobic subunits can mimic  the biological properties of host-defense peptides, but relationships between composition and activity are not yet well understood for these materials. hydrophobic subunits in previously studied examples have been limited mostly to cycloalkane-derived structures, with cyclohexyl proving to be particularly promising. the present study evaluates alternative hydrophobic subunits that are  isomeric or nearly isomeric with the cyclohexyl example; each has four sp(3) carbons in the side chains. the results show that varying the substitution pattern of the hydrophobic subunit leads to relatively small changes in antibacterial activity but causes significant changes in hemolytic activity. we hypothesize that these differences in biological activity profile arise, at least in part, from variations among the conformational propensities of the hydrophobic subunits. the alpha,alpha,beta,beta-tetramethyl unit is optimal among the subunits we have examined, providing copolymers with potent antibacterial activity and excellent prokaryote vs eukaryote selectivity. bacteria do not readily develop resistance to the new antibacterial nylon-3 copolymers. these findings suggest that variation in subunit conformational properties could be generally valuable in the development of synthetic polymers for biological applications.

TI  == diffusible signal factor (dsf) quorum sensing signal and structurally related molecules enhance the antimicrobial efficacy of antibiotics against some bacterial pathogens.
AB  == background: extensive use of antibiotics has fostered the emergence of superbugs  that are resistant to multidrugs, which becomes a great healthcare and public concern. previous studies showed that quorum sensing signal dsf (diffusible signal factor) not only modulates bacterial antibiotic resistance through intraspecies signaling, but also affects bacterial antibiotic tolerance through interspecies communication. these findings motivate us to exploit the possibility of using dsf and its structurally related molecules as adjuvants to influence antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial pathogens. results: in this study, we have demonstrated that dsf signal and its structurally related molecules could be used to induce bacterial antibiotic susceptibility. exogenous addition of dsf signal (cis-11-methyl-2-dodecenoic acid) and its structural analogues could significantly increase the antibiotic susceptibility of bacillus cereus, possibly through reducing drug-resistant activity, biofilm formation and bacterial fitness. the synergistic effect of dsf and its structurally related molecules with antibiotics on b. cereus is dosage-dependent. combination of dsf with gentamicin showed an obviously synergistic effect on b. cereus pathogenicity in an in vitro model. we also found that dsf could increase the antibiotic susceptibility of other bacterial species, including bacillus thuringiensis, staphylococcus aureus, mycobacterium smegmatis, neisseria subflava and pseudomonas aeruginosa. conclusion: the results indicate a promising potential of using dsf and its structurally related molecules as novel adjuvants to conventional antibiotics for treatment of infectious diseases caused by bacterial pathogens.

TI  == the long-term effects of phage concentration on the inhibition of planktonic bacterial cultures.
AB  == since the early 1920s there has been an interest in using bacteriophages (phages) for the control of bacterial pathogens. while there are many factors that have limited the success of phage bio-control, one particular problem is the variability of outcomes between phages and bacteria. specifically, there is a significant need for a better understanding of how initial phage concentrations affect long-term bacterial inhibition. in work reported herein three phages were  isolated for escherichia coli k12, pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1, as well as bacillus cereus and bio-control experiments were performed with phage concentrations ranging from 10(5) to 10(8) plaque forming units per ml over the course of 72 h. for four of the nine phages isolated there was a linear relationship between inhibition and phage concentration, suggesting the effect of phage concentration is important at longer time scales. for three of the isolated phages, phage concentrations had no effect on bacterial inhibition suggesting that even at the lowest concentration the method of action was saturated and lower concentrations might still be effective. additionally, a cocktail was created and was compared to the previously isolated phages. there was no statistical difference between the cocktail and the best performing phage highlighting the importance of selecting the appropriate phages for treatment. these results suggest that, for certain phages, there is a strong relationship between phage concentration and long-term bacterial growth inhibition and the initial phage concentration is an important indicator of the long-term outcome.

AB  == an active edible film from soluble soybean polysaccharide (ssps) incorporated with different concentrations of zataria multiflora boiss (zeo) and mentha pulegium (meo) essential oils was developed, and the film's optical, wettability, thermal, total phenol and antioxidant characteristics were investigated, along with their antimicrobial effectiveness against staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli o157:h7, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium. the film's colour became darker and more yellowish and had a lower gloss as the levels of zeo or meo were increased. antioxidant activity of the films was determined using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (dpph), and ferric-reducing antioxidant power assays. dpph was reduced in the range of 19.84-74.12% depending on the essential oil type and concentration. film incorporated with 3% (v/v) zeo showed the highest dpph radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing antioxidant power (ic50=4188.60+/-21.73mg/l and ec50=8.86+/-0.09mg/ml, respectively), compared with the control and meo added film. films containing zeo were more effective against the tested bacteria than those containing meo. s. aureus was found to be the most sensitive bacterium to both zeo or meo, followed by b. cereus and e. coli. a highest inhibition zone of  387.05mm(2) was observed for s. aureus around the films incorporated with 3% (v/v) zeo. the total inhibitory zone of 3% (v/v) meo formulated films was 21.98 for s. typhimurium and 10.15mm(2) for p. aeruginosa. differential scanning calorimetry (dsc) analysis revealed a single glass transition temperature (tg) between 16 and 31 degrees c. the contact angle increased up to 175% and 38% as 3% (v/v) of zeo or meo used: it clearly shows that films with zeo were more hydrophobic than those with meo. the results showed that these two essential oils could be incorporated into ssps films for food packaging.

TI  == potential cellular targets and antibacterial efficacy of atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma.
AB  == atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (apntp) has been gaining increasing interest as a new alternative antibacterial approach. although this approach has  demonstrated promising antibacterial activity, its exact mechanism of action remains unclear. mechanistic elucidation of the antimicrobial activity will facilitate development and rational optimisation of this approach for potential medical applications. in this study, the antibacterial efficacy of an in-house-built apntp jet was evaluated alongside an investigation of the interactions between apntp and major cellular components in order to identify the potential cellular targets involved in plasma-mediated bacterial destruction mechanisms. the investigated plasma jet exhibited excellent, rapid antibacterial  activity against a selected panel of clinically significant bacterial species including bacillus cereus, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, all of which were completely inactivated within 2 min of plasma exposure. plasma-mediated damaging effects were observed, to varying degrees, on all of the investigated cellular components including dna, a model protein enzyme, and lipid membrane integrity and permeability. the antibacterial efficacy of apntp appears to involve a multiple-target mechanism, which potentially reduces the likelihood of emergence  of microbial resistance towards this promising antimicrobial approach. however, cellular membrane damage and resulting permeability perturbation was found to be  the most likely rate-determining step in this mechanism.

TI  == metal based pharmacologically active agents: synthesis, structural characterization, molecular modeling, ct-dna binding studies and in vitro antimicrobial screening of iron(ii) bromosalicylidene amino acid chelates.
AB  == in recent years, great interest has been focused on fe(ii) schiff base amino acid complexes as cytotoxic and antitumor drugs. thus a series of new iron(ii) complexes based on schiff bases amino acids ligands have been designed and synthesized from condensation of 5-bromosalicylaldehyde (bs) and alpha-amino acids (l-alanine (ala), l-phenylalanine (phala), l-aspartic acid (aspa), l-histidine (his) and l-arginine (arg)). the structure of the investigated iron(ii) complexes was elucidated using elemental analyses, infrared, ultraviolet-visible, thermogravimetric analysis, as well as conductivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements. moreover, the stoichiometry and the stability constants of the prepared complexes have been determined spectrophotometrically. the results suggest that 5-bromosalicylaldehyde amino acid schiff bases (bs:aa) behave as dibasic tridentate ono ligands and coordinate to fe(ii) in octahedral geometry according to the general formula [fe(bs:aa)2].nh2o. the conductivity values between 37 and 64 ohm(-1) mol(-1) cm(2) in ethanol imply the presence of nonelectrolyte species. the structure of the complexes was validated using quantum mechanics calculations based on accurate dft methods. geometry optimization of the fe-schiff base amino acid complexes showed that all complexes had octahedral coordination. in addition, the interaction of these complexes with (ct-dna) was investigated at ph=7.2, by using uv-vis absorption, viscosity and agarose gel electrophoresis measurements. results indicated that the investigated complexes strongly bind to calf thymus dna via intercalative mode and showed a different dna binding according to the sequence: bsari>bshi>bsali>bsasi>bsphali. moreover, the prepared compounds are screened for their in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activity against three types of bacteria, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus cereus and three types of anti fungal cultures, penicillium purpurogenium, aspergillus flavus and trichotheium rosium. the results of these studies indicated that the metal complexes exhibit a stronger antibacterial and antifungal efficiency than their corresponding schiff base amino acid ligands.

TI  == cyclic dipeptides from rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode-associated bacillus cereus have antimicrobial activities.
AB  == the cell free culture filtrate of bacillus cereus associated with an entomopathogenic nematode, rhabditis (oscheius) sp. exhibited strong antimicrobial activity. the ethyl acetate extract of the bacterial culture filtrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography to obtain four bioactive compounds. the structure and absolute stereochemistry of these compounds were determined based on extensive spectroscopic analyses (fabms, (1)h  nmr, (13)c nmr, (1)h-(1)h cosy, (1)h-(13)c hmbc) and marfey's method. the compounds were identified as cyclic dipeptides (cdps): cyclo(l-pro-l-trp), cyclo(l-leu-l-val), cyclo(d-pro-d-met), and cyclo(d-pro-d-phe), respectively. compounds recorded significant antibacterial activity against all the test bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant s. aureus) except cyclo(l-leu-l-val). cyclo(l-leu-l-val) recorded activity only against gram positive bacteria. best antibacterial activity was recorded by cyclo(l-pro-l-trp) against s. aureus (4 mug/ml). the four compounds were active against all the five fungi tested (trichophyton rubrum, aspergillus flavus, candida albicans, candida tropicalis and cryptococcus neoformans) and the activity was compared with amphotericin b, the standard fungicide. the highest activity of 1 mug/ml by cyclo(l-pro-l-trp) was recorded against t. rubrum, a human pathogen responsible for causing athlete's foot, jock itch, and ringworm. the activity of cyclo(l-pro-l-trp) against t. rubrum, c. neoformans and c. albicans were better than amphotericin b, the standard antifungal agent. to our knowledge, this is the first report of antifungal activity of cdps against the human pathogenic fungi t. rubrum and c. neoformans. the four cdps are nontoxic to healthy human cell line up to 200 mug/ml. we conclude that the bacterium associated with entomopathogenic nematode is promising sources of natural antimicrobial secondary metabolites, which may receive greater benefit as potential sources of new drugs in the pharmaceutical industry.

TI  == enhanced antimicrobial activity of peptide-cocktails against common bacterial contaminants of ex vivo stored platelets.
AB  == bacterial contamination of blood components such as ex vivo-stored platelets is a major safety risk in transfusion medicine. we have recently shown that synthetic  antimicrobial peptides named pd1-pd4 derived from the thrombin-induced human platelet-derived antimicrobial proteins, and repeats of arg-trp (rw1-rw5) demonstrate microbicidal activity against selected bacteria and viruses. in the present study, we selected pd3, pd4, rw2, rw3 and rw4 and evaluated each individual peptide and their various combinations to see whether the cocktail regimen enhances the antimicrobial activity above and over the individual peptides. stored platelet or plasma samples spiked with known titres of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and bacillus cereus were treated with either individual peptides or with peptides in various combinations. analyses revealed that individual peptides show moderate microbicidal activity (10- to 100-fold reduction) against the tested bacteria relative to their combined regimen. the peptide combinations (rw2 + rw4, rw2 + rw3 + rw4 and pd4 + rw3 + rw4) on the other hand enhanced the microbicidal activity (c.10 000-fold reduction) and revealed a minimal inhibitory concentration of 5 mum. time-kill kinetics indicated that these three peptide combinations exhibited enhanced antimicrobial  activity bringing about a 100-fold reduction of bacterial titres within 20 min of incubation. the present study therefore demonstrates the synergistic effect of antimicrobial peptides when used in combinations and provides a proof-of-concept  of its potential application as a molecular tool towards pathogen reduction and further extends the possibility of using peptide combinatorial therapeutics as broad-spectrum antibiotics or as alternatives to combat drug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == microchip-based terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism for on-site analysis of bacterial communities in freshwater.
AB  == assessing microbiological quality assurance by monitoring bacteria in various sources of freshwater used for human consumption, recreation, and food preparation is important for a healthy life. bacterial number and their community structure in freshwater should be determined as quickly as possible, and "real-time" and "on-site" microbiological methods are required. in this study, we examined the protocol for microchip-based terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis, which uses microchip electrophoresis for rapid microbial community analysis. the availability of microchip-based t-rflp was compared with conventional t-rflp analysis, which uses a capillary electrophoresis system, with freshwater samples (spring water, river water, groundwater, and hydroponics solution). the detection limit of targeted bacteria  by on-chip t-rflp analysis was 1% (10(3) cells/ml). the fragment sizes determined by the two analysis methods were highly correlated (r(2)=0.98). on-chip t-rflp analysis was completed within 15 min. t-rflp profiles of nine hydroponics solution samples were analyzed by multidimensional scaling. considerable changes  and stability in bacterial community structure during hydroponic culture were detected by both analyses. these results show that on-chip t-rflp analysis can monitor changes in bacterial community structure, as well as conventional t-rflp  analysis. the present results indicate that on-chip t-rflp analysis is an effective tool for rapid and "on-site" bacterial community profiling in freshwater environments, as well as freshwater used for medical and industrial purposes.

TI  == plant-based hydrocarbon esters from tragia involucrata possess antimicrobial and  anti-inflammatory activities.
AB  == antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of hydrocarbon esters obtained from tragia involucrata were evaluated by disk-diffusion (250 microg/ml), and broth-dilution (500-7.8 microg/ml), methods against bacteria. among the compounds, shellsol showed the most potent activity against burkholderia pseudomallei (khw), aeromonas hydrophila, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. interestingly, vinyl hexylether was active against food-spoilage bacteria (bacillus cereus and proteus vulgaris), 2, 4-methyl hexane also exerted antimicrobial activity against k. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, b. pseudomallei, alcaligens viscolactis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. 2-methylnonane  and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane showed only weak activity. for example, shellsol showed bacteriostatic effect (mic of 7.8 microg/ml) against a. hydrophila, vinyl hexylether (mic of 15.6 microg/ml) against p. mirabilis, and 2, 4-methyl hexane (mic of 31.25 microg/ml) on b. pseudomallei. cytotoxic effects of compounds were  assayed in human skin and monkey kidney cells (62.5-2000 microg/ml) by an xtt assay. the vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol did not show any toxicity up to 1000 microg/ml concentrations. the 2-methylnonane and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane induced morphological changes (e.g. cell disintegration and lysis) of both cell types at a 2000 microg/ml. the vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol were devoid of toxic effects; however, 2-methylnonane induced weight loss and severe necrosis as evidenced by histopathological and serum biochemical analysis in rats. interestingly, shellsol showed the maximum inhibition of carrageenan-induced, paw oedema in rats. in conclusion, findings of this study clearly indicate that biologically active hydrocarbon esters, such as shellsol, vinyl hexylether, and 2, 4-dimethyl hexane  isolated from t. involucrata, may effectively control the growth of certain food-borne and food-spoilage pathogens.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of schinus lentiscifolius (anacardiaceae).
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: schinus lentiscifolius marchand (syn. schinus weinmannifolius engl) is a plant native to rio grande do sul (southern brazil) and has been used in brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. material and methods: the crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, three gram negative bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: candida albicans, candida tropicalis, cryptococcus neoformans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two gram positive bacteria, namely, bacillus cereus, enterococcus spp, and six gram negative bacteria, namely, burkholderia cepacia, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis. results: the leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of schinus lentiscifolius showed a  broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (mic) against the tested bacteria and fungi. the n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against candida albicans (mic=25 mug/ml), candida tropicalis (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and cryptococcus neoformans, (mic=15.5 mug/ml). from the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of schinus lentiscifolius. conclusion: the antimicrobial activity and some constituents of schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. the results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.

TI  == design, characterization, teratogenicity testing, antibacterial, antifungal and dna interaction of few high spin fe(ii) schiff base amino acid complexes.
AB  == in this study, new fe(ii) schiff base amino acid chelates derived from the condensation of o-hydroxynaphthaldehyde with l-alanine, l-phenylalanine, l-aspartic acid, l-histidine and l-arginine were synthesized and characterized via elemental, thermogravimetric analysis, molar conductance, ir, electronic, mass spectra and magnetic moment measurements. the stoichiometry and the stability constants of the complexes were determined spectrophotometrically. correlation of all spectroscopic data suggested that schiff bases ligands exhibited tridentate with ono sites coordinating to the metal ions via protonated phenolic-oh, azomethine-n and carboxylate-o with the general formulae [fe(hl)2].nh2o. but in case of l-histidine, the ligand acts as tetradentate via deprotonated phenolic-oh, azomethine-n, carboxylate-o and n-imidazole ring ([fel(h2o)2].2h2o), where hl=mono anion and l=dianion of the ligand. the structure of the prepared complexes is suggested to be octahedral. the prepared complexes were tested for their teratogenicity on chick embryos and found to be safe until a concentration of 100 mug/egg with full embryos formation. moreover,  the interaction between ct-dna and the investigated complexes were followed by spectrophotometric and viscosity measurements. it was found that, the prepared complexes bind to dna via classical intercalative mode and showed a different dna activity with the sequence: nhi>nari>nali>nasi>nphali. furthermore, the free ligands and their complexes are screened for their in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activity against three types of bacteria, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus cereus and three types of anti fungal cultures, penicillium purpurogenium, aspergillus flavus and trichotheium rosium in order to assess their antimicrobial potential. the results show that the metal complexes are more reactive with respect to their corresponding schiff base amino acid ligands.

TI  == [analysis of bactericidal material generated by electrical devices advertising bactericidal ability against bacteria on the agar gel plates].
AB  == several japanese companies sell electrical devices advertised as effective in inactivating viruses and killing bacteria by releasing special materials, e.g., plasmacluster ions, nanoe particle and minus ions, into the air. these companies  claim that their devices killed bacteria on plates in their own experiments. we tested device effectiveness using the same experiments from the plasmacluster ioniser sharp co., japan, the nanoe generator panasonic co., japan, and the vion  king jim co., japan, to test their advertising claims. bactericidal ability on agar plate was tested, using staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis as follows: the medium containing a certain amount of each bacterium was put onto an agar plate and smeared. plates were kept in a closed chamber (inner volume 14.4 m3) or a glove box (inner volume 0.2 m), with one of the devices run for 2 hours. plates not exposed to any device were used as controls. each plate was retrieved and put in an incubator to count  the number of bacterial colonies formed on the plate. there was no significant difference in the number of colonies on plates exposed to devices compared to control, in the number for all devices, or in all bacteria tested in experiments  in the 14.4 m3 chamber. these results strongly suggest that these devices have almost no bactericidal effect, at least in space exceeding this volume. colony formation was suppressed in the glove box in all devices and in all bacteria tested except p. aeruginosa, although the degree of suppression differed among experiments. the colony formation suppression mechanism was analyzed, and indicated that:colony formation did not change even after the removal of plasmacluster ions, nanoe particles, or negative ions from the air, while colony  formation was decreased drastically by the removal of ozone from space, which was revealed to be generated inevitably during device operation. these results strongly suggest that the bactericidal effect seen only on the agar plate in narrow space was explained by ozone released in space as a by-product, not by special materials as advertising claimed. it is thus important to analyze the effect of special materials such as those done in this study and to suggest the involvement of ozone as the true cause, as have been done in this study, in evaluating bactericidal effect or viral inactivation as advertised by these companies.

AB  == column experiments were conducted to investigate the transport of aqueous c60 (aqu-nc60), fullerol, silver nanoparticles (nps) coated with polyvinylpyrrolidone (ag-pvp) and stabilized by citrate (ag-cit) in biofilm-laden porous media. gram-negative pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa) and gram-positive bacillus cereus (bc)  biofilm-laden glass beads were selected to represent the bacterial interfaces nps might encounter in the natural aquatic environment. the biomass distribution, extracellular polymeric substances (eps) components, electrokinetic property, and hydrophobicity of these interfaces were characterized, and the hydrophobicity was found to correlate with the quantity of proteins in eps. the retention of nps on  glass beads coated with bovine serum albumin (bsa) and alginate were also studied. except for ag-pvp, the affinity of nps for porous medium, indicated by attachment efficiency alpha, increased in the presence of biofilms, bsa and alginate. for hydrophobic aqu-nc60, the larger the proteins/polysaccharides ratio, the larger the alpha, suggesting the hydrophobic interaction determines the attachment of aqu-nc60 to the collector surface. uncharged pvp stabilized ag-pvp by steric repulsion, and the attachment to glass beads was not enhanced by biofilm. the presence of divalent ion ca(2+) significantly hydrophobized biofilm, bsa, and alginate-coated glass beads and further retarded the mobility of aqu-nc60, fullerol, and ag-cit; while ag-pvp was again sterically stabilized.

TI  == the insect galleria mellonella as a powerful infection model to investigate bacterial pathogenesis.
AB  == the study of bacterial virulence often requires a suitable animal model. mammalian models of infection are costly and may raise ethical issues. the use of insects as infection models provides a valuable alternative. compared to other non-vertebrate model hosts such as nematodes, insects have a relatively advanced  system of antimicrobial defenses and are thus more likely to produce information  relevant to the mammalian infection process. like mammals, insects possess a complex innate immune system(1). cells in the hemolymph are capable of phagocytosing or encapsulating microbial invaders, and humoral responses include  the inducible production of lysozyme and small antibacterial peptides(2,3). in addition, analogies are found between the epithelial cells of insect larval midguts and intestinal cells of mammalian digestive systems. finally, several basic components essential for the bacterial infection process such as cell adhesion, resistance to antimicrobial peptides, tissue degradation and adaptation to oxidative stress are likely to be important in both insects and mammals(1). thus, insects are polyvalent tools for the identification and characterization of microbial virulence factors involved in mammalian infections. larvae of the greater wax moth galleria mellonella have been shown to provide a useful insight  into the pathogenesis of a wide range of microbial infections including mammalian fungal (fusarium oxysporum, aspergillus fumigatus, candida albicans) and bacterial pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris, serratia marcescens pseudomonas aeruginosa, listeria monocytogenes or enterococcus faecalis(4-7). regardless of the bacterial species, results obtained with galleria larvae infected by direct injection through the cuticle consistently correlate with those of similar mammalian studies: bacterial strains that are attenuated in mammalian models demonstrate lower virulence in galleria, and strains causing severe human infections are also highly virulent in the galleria  model(8-11). oral infection of galleria is much less used and additional compounds, like specific toxins, are needed to reach mortality. g. mellonella larvae present several technical advantages: they are relatively large (last instar larvae before pupation are about 2 cm long and weight 250 mg), thus enabling the injection of defined doses of bacteria; they can be reared at various temperatures (20 degrees c to 30 degrees c) and infection studies can be  conducted between 15 degrees c to above 37 degrees c(12,13), allowing experiments that mimic a mammalian environment. in addition, insect rearing is easy and relatively cheap. infection of the larvae allows monitoring bacterial virulence by several means, including calculation of ld50(14), measurement of bacterial survival(15,16) and examination of the infection process(17). here, we describe the rearing of the insects, covering all life stages of g. mellonella. we provide a detailed protocol of infection by two routes of inoculation: oral and intra haemocoelic. the bacterial model used in this protocol is bacillus cereus, a gram positive pathogen implicated in gastrointestinal as well as in other severe local or systemic opportunistic infections(18,19).

TI  == bacterial quorum sensing: its role in virulence and possibilities for its control.
AB  == quorum sensing is a process of cell-cell communication that allows bacteria to share information about cell density and adjust gene expression accordingly. this process enables bacteria to express energetically expensive processes as a collective only when the impact of those processes on the environment or on a host will be maximized. among the many traits controlled by quorum sensing is the expression of virulence factors by pathogenic bacteria. here we review the quorum-sensing circuits of staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio cholerae. we outline these canonical quorum-sensing mechanisms and how each uniquely controls virulence factor production. additionally, we examine recent efforts to inhibit quorum sensing in these pathogens with the goal of designing novel antimicrobial therapeutics.

TI  == antibacterial effect of phosphates and polyphosphates with different chain length.
AB  == the aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, salmonella enterica ser. enteritidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. the tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. in the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the ph values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. the inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. phosphates obviously made the development of most gram-positive bacteria impossible. especially micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. on the other  hand, gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. the exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. it should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates hexa68 and hexa70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. by comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be  concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on ph values.

TI  == a broad-range method to detect genomic dna of multiple pathogenic bacteria based  on the aggregation strategy of gold nanorods.
AB  == it remains challenging to detect unknown pathogenic bacteria in diagnostic, clinical and environmental fields. this work describes the approach to the development of a sensitive, broad-range genosensing assay targeting the conserved 16s rdna region existing in most bacteria, by monitoring the aggregation level of gold nanorods (gnrs)-based nanoprobes through their localized surface plasmon resonance (lspr) property. in the quantitative detection of artificial sequence,  the limit of detection (lod) of such a bioassay is demonstrated to reach the 5 pm level. this pair of universal gnrs-based nanoprobes can further identify at least 6 species of bacteria that were most prevalent in platelet concentrates (pcs) and have no cross-reaction with other pathogens. moreover, it also exhibits higher sensitivity than other broad-range methods in analysing serratia marcescens-spiked pcs. therefore, the presented strategy not only provides a novel and effective dna analysis method to detect multiple bacterial contaminations in pcs, but also opens up possibilities for its future use of detecting unknown bacteria in other systems, such as food and water, even at ultralow levels.

AB  == the hygroscopic secretion produced by the secretory setae of terrestrial larvae of the biting midge forcipomyia nigra (winnertz) was analysed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (gc-ms). the viscous secretion is stored at the top of each seta and absorbs water from moist air. gc-ms analyses (four independent tests) showed that the secretion contained 12 free fatty acids, the most abundant of which were oleic (18:1), palmitic (16:0), palmitoleic (16:1) and linoleic (18:2). other acids identified were valeric (5:0), enanthic (7:0), caprylic (8:0), pelargonic (9:0), capric (10:0), lauric (12:0), myristic (14:0) and stearic (18:0). two other compounds, glycerol and pyroglutamic acid, were also found. the antibacterial activity of the fatty acids and pyroglutamic acid was tested using the agar disc diffusion method and targeted gram positive (bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis) and gram negative bacterial strains (citrobacter freundii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens). the antifungal activity was tested by determining minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of examined compounds. fatty acids were tested against enthomopathogenic fungi (paecilomyces lilacinus, paecilomyces fumosoroseus, lecanicillium lecanii, metarhizium anisopliae, beauveria bassiana (tve-n39), beauveria bassiana (dv-1/07)). the most effective acids against bacterial and fungal growth were c(9:0), c(10:0) and c(16:1), whereas c(14:0), c(16:0,) c(18:0) and c(18:1) demonstrated rather poor antifungal activity and did not inhibit the growth of bacteria. the antimicrobial assay investigated mixtures of fatty and pyroglutamic acids (corresponding to the results of each gc-ms test): they were found to be active against almost all the bacteria except p. fluorescens and also demonstrated certain fungistatic activity against enthomopathogenic fungi. the hygroscopic secretion facilitates cuticular respiration and plays an important role in the antimicrobial protection of f. nigra larvae living in moist terrestrial habitats.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of platelet (plt)-poor plasma, plt-rich plasma, plt gel, and solvent/detergent-treated plt lysate biomaterials against wound bacteria.
AB  == background: platelet (plt) gels exhibit antimicrobial activity useful for wound healing. the nature of the antibacterial component(s) is unknown. study design and methods: plt-poor plasma (ppp), plt-rich plasma (prp), plt gel (pg), and solvent/detergent-treated plt lysate (s/d-pl) from two donors were evaluated either native or after complement heat inactivation. materials were spiked at a 10% ratio (vol/vol) with approximately 10(7-8) colony-forming units/ml with four  gram-positive and four gram-negative bacteria of the wound flora. bacterial count was determined by plate assays at time of spiking and after 3 and 48 hours at 31  degrees c. bacteria growth inhibition tests were also performed. results: there was no viable escherichia coli colony for 48 hours after spiking to the plasma and plt materials from both donors, corresponding to greater than 7.51 to greater than 9.05 log inactivation. pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus were inactivated (approx. 4.7, 7, and 2 log, respectively)  3 hours after spiking to prp, ppp, or s/d-pl from the first donor but less (1.1,  4.6, and 0.2 log, respectively) in pg, before a regrowth at 48 hours in all materials. similar data were obtained with the second donor. no plasma and plt material had antimicrobial activity against enterobacter cloacae, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, and staphylococcus epidermidis. complement-inactivated samples had no antimicrobial activity. conclusion: plasma complement is mostly responsible for the activity of plasma and plt biomaterials against e. coli, p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and s. aureus. activation of the coagulation to prepare pg may reduce antimicrobial activity. these findings may help optimize the control of wound infections by blood biomaterials.

TI  == development of metal-chelating inhibitors for the class ii fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (fbp) aldolase.
AB  == it has long been suggested that the essential and ubiquitous enzyme fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (fbp) aldolase could be a good drug target against bacteria and  fungi, since lower organisms possess a metal-dependant (class ii) fbp aldolase, as opposed to higher organisms which possess a schiff-base forming (class i) fbp  aldolase. we have tested the capacity of derivatives of the metal-chelating compound dipicolinic acid (dpa), as well a thiol-containing compound, to inhibit  purified recombinant class ii fbp aldolases from mycobacterium tuberculosis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus cereus, bacillus anthracis, and from the rice blast causative agent magnaporthe grisea. the aldolase from m. tuberculosis was the most sensitive to the metal-chelating inhibitors, with an ic(50) of 5.2 mum with 2,3-dimercaptopropanesulfonate (dmps) and 28 mum with dpa. dmps and the synthesized inhibitor 6-(phosphonomethyl)picolinic acid inhibited the enzyme in a time-dependent, competitive fashion, with second order rate constants of 273 and  270 m(-1) s(-1) respectively for the binding of these compounds to the m. tuberculosis aldolase's active site in the presence of the substrate fbp (k(m) 27.9 mum). the most potent first generation inhibitors were modeled into the active site of the m. tuberculosis aldolase structure, with results indicating that the metal chelators tested cannot bind the catalytic zinc in a bidentate fashion while it remains in its catalytic location, and that most enzyme-ligand interactions involve the phosphate binding pocket residues.

TI  == antimicrobial effects of silver nanoparticles against bacterial cells adhered to  stainless steel surfaces.
AB  == given the increasing number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the need to synthesize new antimicrobials, silver has attracted interest in the scientific community because of its recognized antimicrobial activity. this study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of silver nanoparticles (np) obtained by a new method and tested at concentrations of 6 mug/ml and 60 mug/ml against the species staphylococcus aureus, listeria innocua, salmonella choleraesuis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and bacillus cereus. the ability of these nanoparticles to remove or kill vegetative cells adhered to stainless steel surfaces was also evaluated. we observed that the np obtained with the new method, concentrated silver nanoparticles (cnp), and silver nanoparticles with added sodium chloride (npnacl) had high antimicrobial activities (p < 0.05). we also verified that the most effective condition for the removal of p. aeruginosa  cells on stainless steel coupons (10 by 10 mm) was immersion of the surfaces in cnp. the cnp treatment produced a 5-log reduction of the microbial population after 30 to 60 min of immersion. the cnp treatment also performed better than water and sodium carbonate, a compound commonly applied in clean-in-place procedures in the food industry, in removing adherent b. cereus cells from stainless steel cylinders. therefore, these results suggest that np synthesized by a new procedure may be used as antimicrobials in the food industry, for example, for the sanitization of utensils that come into contact with foods.

TI  == a comparative study of the bactericidal activity and daily disinfection housekeeping surfaces by a new portable pulsed uv radiation device.
AB  == daily cleaning and disinfecting of non-critical surfaces in the patient-care areas are known to reduce the occurrence of health care-associated infections. however, the conventional means for decontamination of housekeeping surfaces of sites of frequent hand contact such as manual disinfection using ethanol wipes are laborious and time-consuming in daily practice. this study evaluated a newly  developed portable pulsed ultraviolet (uv) radiation device for its bactericidal  activity in comparison with continuous uv-c, and investigated its effect on the labor burden when implemented in a hospital ward. pseudomonas aeruginosa, multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, amikacin and ciprofloxacin-resistant a. baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus and bacillus cereus were irradiated with pulsed uv or continuous uv-c. pulsed uv and continuous uv-c required 5 and 30 s of irradiation, respectively, to attain bactericidal activity with more than 2log growth inhibition of all the species. the use of pulsed uv in daily disinfection  of housekeeping surfaces reduced the working hours by half in comparison to manual disinfection using ethanol wipes. the new portable pulsed uv radiation device was proven to have a bactericidal activity against critical nosocomial bacteria, including antimicrobial-resistant bacteria after short irradiation, and was thus found to be practical as a method for disinfecting housekeeping surfaces and decreasing the labor burden.

TI  == removal of high concentrations of nh(3) by a combined photoreactor and biotrickling filter system.
AB  == average emission levels as high as 800 ppm(v) nh(3) have often been found during  the anaerobic fermentation process. at these levels, nh(3) is regarded as an environmental toxic compound. high concentrations of nh(3) gas are difficult to treat in a single treatment process, suggesting that, in terms of economic cost and treatment performance, a coupled system may be a feasible technological alternative. in the coupled tio(2) photocatalytic-biological treatment system evaluated here, the optimal gas retention time for nh(3) removal--in terms of removal efficiency and capital cost--was 26 s. high gas temperatures, high nh(3)  concentrations, and low oxygen contents were unfavorable conditions for nh(3) removal by the photoreactor. the coupled system successfully removed concentrated nh(3) gas (r % > 97 %) under disrupted and shutdown conditions. the photoreactor  component of the system successfully fulfilled its role as a pretreatment process and enhanced the performance of the biotrickling filter at a high inlet nh(3) load (2,277 g-n m(-3) day(-1)). potential ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, including bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas sp., were isolated  under the high inlet nh(3) load condition. these microbial strains have a potential as biological agents in the removal of high concentrations of nh(3) in  waste gas or wastewater.

TI  == defense role of the cocoon in the silk worm bombyx mori l.
AB  == silk from the domesticated silk worm bombyx mori procures foreign body response naturally, so it has been utilized as a biomaterial for decades. in india the prime focus of the sericulture industry is to improve silk production with high quality silk. naturally, the silk worm builds its cocoon not only with silk proteins, but also with antimicrobial proteins to avoid infection since the cocoon is non-motile and non-feeding. the aim of the present study is to elucidate the antimicrobial proteins that persist in the cocoon of the silk worm  bombyx mori. at the pupal stage, the silk worm cocoon shell extract was prepared  from the day of pupation (p0) to the day of natural rupture of the cocoon for the eclosion of moth (nr). using the cocoon shell extract a microbial susceptibility  test was performed by the disc diffusion method against the microbes escherchia coli, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae. the development of a zone of inhibition against the microbes confirmed the presence of antimicrobial/immunogenic activity of the cocoon shell extract. for further analysis, the cocoon shell extract was subjected to 7-15% sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page). the protein profile of the cocoon extract revealed the coomassie blue stained bands resolved from the 150-15 kda molecular range. interestingly, a polypeptide localized at around 29 kda showed remarkable expressional changes during the development of pupa. to characterize the 29 kda protein, it was eluted from the gel, digested with trypsin and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (maldi-ms). the trypsin-digested peptide  peaks were analyzed through mascot and peptides were matched with the ncbi nr database. the peptides were very well matched with the 18 wheeler protein, which  is reported to be responsible for innate immunity, belonging to the toll family in insects and responsible for cellular mediated immunity.

TI  == exponential atp amplification through simultaneous regeneration from amp and pyrophosphate for luminescence detection of bacteria.
AB  == bacteria monitoring is essential for many industrial manufacturing processes, particularly those involving in food, biopharmaceuticals, and semiconductor production. firefly luciferase atp luminescence assay is a rapid and simple bacteria detection method. however, the detection limit of this assay for escherichia coli is approximately 10(4) colony-forming units (cfu), which is insufficient for many applications. this study aims to improve the assay sensitivity by simultaneous conversion of pp(i) and amp, two products of the luciferase reaction, back to atp to form two chain-reaction loops. because each consumed atp continuously produces two new atp molecules, this approach can achieve exponential amplification of atp. two consecutive enzyme reactions were employed to regenerate amp into atp: adenylate kinase converting amp into adp using utp as the energy source, and acetate kinase catalyzing acetyl phosphate and adp into atp. the pp(i)-recycling loop was completed using atp sulfurylase and adenosine 5' phosphosulfate. the modification maintains good quantification linearity in the atp luminescence assay and greatly increases its bacteria detection sensitivity. this improved method can detect bacteria concentrations of fewer than 10 cfu. this exponential atp amplification assay will benefit bacteria monitoring in public health and manufacturing processes that require high-quality water.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of mangrove plant (lumnitzera littorea).
AB  == objective: to investigate the antimicrobial activities of n-hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of the leaves of lumnitzera littorea (l. littorea) against  six human pathogenic microbes. methods: the antimicrobial activity was evaluated  using disc diffusion and microdilution methods. results: the antimicrobial activities of the crude extracts were increased with increasing the concentration. it is clear that n-hexane extract was the most effective extract.  additionally, gram positive bacillus cereus (b. cereus) appear to be the most sensitive strain while pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa) and the yeast strains (candida albicans (c. albicans) and cryptococcus neoformans (c. neoformans)) appear to be resistance to the tested concentrations since no inhibition zone was observed. the inhibition of microbial growth at concentration as low as 0.04 mg/ml indicated the potent antimicrobial activity of l. littorea extracts. conclusions: the obtained results are considered sufficient for further study to isolate the compounds responsible for the activity and suggesting the possibility of finding potent antibacterial agents from l. littorea extracts.

TI  == effects of photoactivated titanium dioxide nanopowders and coating on planktonic  and biofilm growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == we exploited the ability of photocatalytic titanium dioxide (tio(2)) as an agent  for the biofilm control. two photocatalytic systems were investigated: a 3 g l(-1) suspension of tio(2) nanopowder in demineralized water and glass slides coated with a tio(2) thin film, achieved by sol-gel deposition. a running protocol for the photoactivation of tio(2) was set up using the dye rhodamine b.  the microorganisms studied were pseudomonas stutzeri, pseudomonas aeruginosa and  a bacillus cereus-group as planktonic cells. p. aeruginosa biofilms were also studied at both the solid-liquid and the solid-air interface. the tio(2) nanopowder produced 1-log reduction of bacillus sp. planktonic cells in 24 h, 2-log reduction of p. stutzeri planktonic cells in 30 min and 1-log reduction of  p. aeruginosa planktonic cells in 2 h compared with non-photo-activated tio(2). tio(2) thin film produced almost a complete eradication of p. aeruginosa planktonic cells (initial concentration 10(8) cells ml(-1)) in 24 h compared to a 3-log reduction caused by uv-a light alone. in contrast, neither the photocatalytic treatment with tio(2) film nor that with tio(2) nanopowder had any effect on p. aeruginosa biofilms at all the interfaces investigated. possible explanations for these findings, and for the discrepancy between this work and literature data, are discussed.

TI  == evaluation of four microbial class ii fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase enzymes  for use as biocatalysts.
AB  == fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (fbp) aldolase has been used as biocatalyst in the synthesis of several pharmaceutical compounds such as monosaccharides and analogs. is has been suggested that microbial metal-dependant class ii aldolases  could be better industrial catalysts than mammalian class i enzyme because of their greater stability. the class ii aldolases from four microbes were subcloned into the escherichia coli vector pt7-7, expressed and purified to near homogeneity. the kinetic parameters, temperature stability, ph profile, and tolerance to organic solvents of the class ii enzymes were determined, and compared with the properties of the class i aldolase from rabbit muscle. contrary to results obtained previously with the e. coli class ii aldolase, which was reported to be more stable than the mammalian enzyme, other recombinant class ii  aldolases were found to be generally less stable than the class i enzyme, especially in the presence of organic solvents. class ii aldolase from bacillus cereus showed higher temperature stability than the other enzymes tested, but only the mycobacterium tuberculosis class ii aldolase had a stability comparable  to the class i mammalian enzyme under assay conditions. the turnover number of the recombinant m. tuberculosis and magnaporthe grisea class ii type a aldolases  was comparable or higher than that of the class i enzyme. the recombinant b. cereus and pseudomonas aeruginosa class ii type b aldolases had very low turnover numbers and low metal content, indicating that the e. coli overexpression system  may not be suitable for the class ii type b aldolases from these microorganisms.

TI  == mukbef on the march: taking over chromosome organization in bacteria?
AB  == smc-scpab complexes, also called bacterial condensin, are comprised of highly conserved proteins present in a wide variety of bacteria and archaea. they facilitate bacterial chromosome segregation probably by organizing and/or compacting nascent sister chromosomes. in some gamma-proteobacteria however the smc-scpab complex appears to have been replaced by a different smc complex, called mukbef. petrushenko et al., (2011) now show in this issue of molecular microbiology that distantly related homologues of mukbef, called mksbef, can be found in the genomes of many more species of bacteria (such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus cereus) that seem to be scattered over the phylogenetic tree. the newly identified mksbef proteins are organized in operons like mukbef and occur in combination with smc-scpab and/or mukbef. mutations in mksbef in p.  aeruginosa result in the formation of anucleate cells whereas its mild overexpression can suppress the accumulation of anucleate cells in smc null mutants. these findings suggest that mksbef and smc-scpab share their duties in chromosome partitioning in p. aeruginosa and possibly in other bacteria too. thus, chromosome organization and segregation in bacteria appear to be governed by up to three distinct condensin complexes, indicating that this process could be much more sophisticated than previously appreciated.

TI  == phytochemical analysis and antimicrobial activities of methanolic extracts of leaf, stem and root from different varieties of labisa pumila benth.
AB  == a local herb, kacip fatimah, is famous amongst malay women for its uses in parturition; however, its phytochemical contents have not been fully documented.  therefore, a study was performed to evaluate the phenolics, flavonoids, and total saponin contents, and antibacterial and antifungal properties of the leaf, stem and root of three varieties of labisia pumila benth. total saponins were found to be higher in the leaves of all three varieties, compared to the roots and stems.  leaves of var. pumila exhibited significantly higher total saponin content than var. alata and lanceolata, with values of 56.4, 43.6 and 42.3 mg diosgenin equivalent/g dry weight, respectively. hplc analyses of phenolics and flavonoids  in all three varieties revealed the presence of gallic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, and myricetin in all plant parts. higher levels of flavonoids (rutin, quercitin,  kaempferol) were observed in var. pumila compared with alata and lanceolata, whereas higher accumulation of phenolics (gallic acid, pyrogallol) was recorded in var. alata, followed by pumila and lanceolata. antibacterial activities of leaf, stem and root extracts of all varieties determined against both gram positive (micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis b145, bacillus cereus b43, staphylococcus aureus s1431) and gram negative (enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumonia k36, escherichia coli e256, pseudomonas aeruginosa pi96) pathogens showed that crude methanolic extracts are active against these bacteria at low concentrations, albeit with lower antibacterial activity compared to kanamycin used as the control. antifungal activity of methanolic extracts of all  plant parts against fusarium sp., candida sp. and mucor using the agar diffusion  disc exhibited moderate to appreciable antifungal activities compared to streptomycin used as positive control.

TI  == the role of two families of bacterial enzymes in putrescine synthesis from agmatine via agmatine deiminase.
AB  == putrescine, one of the main biogenic amines associated to microbial food spoilage, can be formed by bacteria from arginine via ornithine decarboxylase (odc), or from agmatine via agmatine deiminase (agdi). this study aims to correlate putrescine production from agmatine to the pathway involving n-carbamoylputrescine formation via addi (the agua product) and n-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase (the agub product), or putrescine carbamoyltransferase (the ptca product) in bacteria. pcr methods were developed to detect the two genes involved in putrescine production from agmatine. putrescine production from agmatine could be linked to the agua and ptca genes in lactobacillus hilgardii x1b, enterococcus faecalis atcc 11700, and bacillus cereus atcc 14579. by contrast lactobacillus sakei 23k was unable to produce putrescine, and although a fragment of dna corresponding to the gene agua was amplified, no amplification was observed for the ptca gene. pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 produces putrescine and is reported to harbour agua and agub genes, responsible for agmatine deiminase and n-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase activities. the enzyme from p. aeruginosa pao1 that converts n-carbamoylputrescine to putrescine (the agub product) is different from other microorganisms studied (the ptca product). therefore, the agub gene from p. aeruginosa pao1 could not be amplified with ptca-specific primers. the agub and ptca genes have frequently been erroneously annotated in the past, as in fact these two enzymes are neither homologous nor analogous. furthermore, the agua, agub and ptca sequences available from genbank were subjected to phylogenetic analysis, revealing that gram-positive bacteria harboured ptca, whereas gram-negative bacteria harbour agub. this paper also discusses the role of the agmatine deiminase system (agds) in acid stress resistance.

AB  == lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) fruit is a widely studied matrix. however, only  few works focus their attention on its seeds, which constitute a major byproduct  of the tomato processing industry. in this study the antimicrobial potential of ten different tomato seed extracts from "bull's heart" and "cherry" varieties were analyzed against gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis and bacillus cereus) and gram-negative (proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium) bacteria and fungi (candida albicans, aspergillus fumigatus and trichophyton rubrum). regarding antibacterial capacity, the different extracts were revealed to be active only against gram-positive bacteria, e. faecalis being the most susceptible one (mic: 2.5-10 mg/ml). concerning antifungal activity, "bull's heart" extracts were the most active. in  a general way c. albicans was the most susceptible species (mic: 5-10 mg/ml). the chemical composition of the extracts was also pursued, concerning organic acids,  phenolics and fatty acids, in order to establish a possible relationship with the observed antimicrobial effect.

TI  == spectral, thermal and in vitro antimicrobial studies of cyclohexylamine-n-dithiocarbamate transition metal complexes.
AB  == transition metal complexes of the type [m(l)(2)] and those containing monodentate phosphines of the type [m(l)(2)(pph(3))] {m=ni, co, cu and zn; l=cyclohexylamine-n-dithiocarbamate; pph(3)=triphenylphosphine} have been synthesized. the complexes were characterized using ir, uv-vis, nmr spectroscopy, and thermal analysis (tga). the (1)h nmr, (13)c nmr and (31)p nmr showed the expected signals for the dithiocarbamate and triphenylphosphine moieties. the spectral studies in all compounds revealed that the coordination of metals occurs via the sulphur atom of the dithiocarbamate ligand in a bidentate fashion. thermal behavior of the complexes showed that the complexes were more stable than their parent ligands. the ligand moiety is lost in the first step and the rest of the organic moiety decomposes in the subsequent steps. furthermore, the ligand and their metal complexes were screened in vitro for their antibacterial activity against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhi, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus cereus and antifungal activities against aspergillus flavus, aspergillus carbonarius, aspergillus niger and aspergillus fumigatus. the metal complexes exhibited higher antimicrobial activity than the parent ligands. generally, the zinc complexes were effective against the growth of bacteria with zn(l)(2) displaying broad spectrum bacteriocidal activity at concentrations of 50microg/ml; and ni(l)(2) was more effective against the growth of fungi at concentrations of 100-400microg/ml under laboratory conditions.

TI  == post-antibacterial effect of thymol.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of thymol has been well established and reported in the scientific literature. continued suppression of bacterial growth following limited exposure to antimicrobial compounds at different concentrations greater than or equal to the minimum inhibitory concentration level (mic) and at concentrations less than the mic can be used as an indicator of biological activity, and are respectively referred to as a post-antibacterial effect (pae) and a post-antibiotic sub-mic effect (pa-sme). in this study, the pae and the pa-sme of thymol against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacillus cereus were investigated. a spectrophotometric method was used to determine the pae and the pa-sme of thymol against the selected test  strains. thymol exhibited a considerable pae and pa-sme at mic and sub-mic concentrations against test strains. the greatest duration of both the pae and the pa-sme was observed for thymol against e. coli and p. aeruginosa. the pae and pa-sme times for e. coli were 12 and 8 h, respectively, and for p. aeruginosa were 11 and 7.5 h, respectively. the duration of the pae and pa-sme observed for  s. aureus and b. cereus was shorter than for gram-negative strains.

TI  == novel family of antimicrobial peptides from the skin of rana shuchinae.
AB  == so far numerous antimicrobial peptides have been characterized from amphibians. in this work, a new family of antimicrobial peptides, named shuchin, was purified and characterized from skin secretions of the frog, rana shuchinae that lives in  freezing mountains. totally two members of shuchin (shuchin 1 and 2) were identified with the amino acid sequence of nalsmprnkcnralmcfg and nalssprnkcdrasscfg, respectively. cdnas encoding shuchins were cloned from the skin cdna library of r. shuchinae. the precursors of shuchin are composed of 62 amino acid residues including the conserved signal peptides, acidic propieces, and mature antimicrobial peptides. synthetic shuchins showed strong and broad antimicrobial activities against gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus; mics<12.5 microg/ml), gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, bacillus dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa; most mics from 3.1 to 12.5 microg/ml), and yeast (candida albicans; mics of 6.25 microg/ml), but no hemolytic activity under the effective concentration, thereby provide more leading templates for designing novel anti-infection agents.

TI  == an assessment of the antibacterial activity in larval excretion/secretion of four species of insects recorded in association with corpses, using lucilia sericata meigen as the marker species.
AB  == the relative antibacterial activities of excretion/secretion (es) from two carrion-feeding insects, calliphora vicina robineau-desvoidy and dermestes maculatus degeer, and a detritivore, tenebrio molitor linnaeus, were compared to  that of lucilia sericata meigen, a species with es of known antibacterial capacity, in order to explore the antimicrobial potential of other carrion and detritivore species. viable counts were used to assess time-kill of es against five bacterial species, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis. antibacterial activity was recorded in all four insect species although t. molitor and d. maculatus were the most effective in controlling growth of p. mirabilis. the blowflies were more effective in controlling a wider range of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the larval es from all species was shown to reduce bacterial growth rate although differences in antibacterial spectrum were noted and the degree of  potency varied between the four species. these differences may be explained ecologically by the different colonisation times of each insect species on the corpse. overall, this study demonstrates that research into other carrion-feeding insect species has potential to provide an increased source of antimicrobial chemicals to broaden the range of bacterial species beyond that currently controlled using l. sericata.

TI  == enhancing atp-based bacteria and biofilm detection by enzymatic pyrophosphate regeneration.
AB  == the manufacturing processes of many electronic and medical products demand the use of high-quality water. hence the water supply systems for these processes are required to be examined regularly for the presence of microorganisms and microbial biofilms. among commonly used bacteria detection approaches, the atp luminescence assay is a rapid, sensitive, and easy to perform method. the aim of  this study is to investigate whether atp regeneration from inorganic pyrophosphate, a product of the atp luminescence assay, can stabilize the bioluminescence signals in atp detection. adpglc pyrophosphorylase (agppase), which catalyzes the synthesis of atp from pp(i) in the presence of adpglc, was selected because the system yields much lower luminescence background than the commercially available atp sulfurylase/adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (aps) system which was broadly used in pyrosequencing technology. the agppase-based assay could be used to measure both pp(i) and atp quantitatively and shows 1.5- to 4.0-fold slight increases in a 10-min assay. the method could also be used to stabilize the luminescence signals in detection of escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa, and bacillus cereus in either broth or biofilm. these findings suggest that the agppase-based atp regeneration system will find many practical applications such as detection of bacterial biofilm in water pipelines.

AB  == microbiologically influenced corrosion is a problem commonly encountered in facilities in the oil and gas industries. the present study describes bacterial enumeration and identification in diesel and naphtha pipelines located in the northwest and southwest region in india, using traditional cultivation technique  and 16s rdna gene sequencing. phylogenetic analysis of 16s rrna sequences of the  isolates was carried out, and the samples obtained from the diesel and naphtha-transporting pipelines showed the occurrence of 11 bacterial species namely serratia marcescens ace2, bacillus subtilis ar12, bacillus cereus ace4, pseudomonas aeruginosa ai1, klebsiella oxytoca acp, pseudomonas stutzeri ap2, bacillus litoralis an1, bacillus sp., bacillus pumilus ar2, bacillus carboniphilus ar3, and bacillus megaterium ar4. sulfate-reducing bacteria were not detected in samples from both pipelines. the dominant bacterial species identified in the petroleum pipeline samples were b. cereus and s. marcescens in  the diesel and naphtha pipelines, respectively. therefore, several types of bacteria may be involved in biocorrosion arising from natural biofilms that develop in industrial facilities. in addition, localized (pitting) corrosion of the pipeline steel in the presence of the consortia was observed by scanning electron microscopy analysis. the potential role of each species in biofilm formation and steel corrosion is discussed.

AB  == infection of galleria mellonella by feeding a mixture of bacillus thuringiensis spores or vegetative bacteria in association with the toxin cry1c results in high levels of larval mortality. under these conditions the toxin or bacteria have minimal effects on the larva when inoculated separately. in order to evaluate whether g. mellonella can function as an oral infection model for human and entomo-bacterial pathogens, we tested strains of bacillus cereus, bacillus anthracis, enterococcus faecalis, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa  and a drosophila targeting pseudomonas entomophila strain. six b. cereus strains  (5 diarrheal, 1 environmental isolate) were first screened in 2nd instar g. mellonella larvae by free ingestion and four of them were analyzed by force-feeding 5th instar larvae. the virulence of these b. cereus strains did not differ from the b. thuringiensis virulent reference strain 407cry(-) with the exception of strain d19 (nvh391/98) that showed a lower virulence. following force-feeding, 5th instar g. mellonella larvae survived infection with b. anthracis, l. monocytogenes, e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa strains in contrast to the p. entomophila strain which led to high mortality even without cry1c toxin co-ingestion. thus, specific virulence factors adapted to the insect intestine might exist in b. thuringiensis/b. cereus and p. entomophila. this suggests a co-evolution between host and pathogens and supports the close links between b. thuringiensis and b. cereus and more distant links to their relative b. anthracis.

AB  == background: buddleja saligna willd (loganiaceae) is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree; trunk short, often gnarled and crooked; crown dense, rounded or domed-shaped; foliage greyish green. the wild olives are traditionally used to lower blood pressures in many parts of the world. in southern africa, bark and leaf decoctions are used to treat colic, coughs, colds, sore eyes, urinary problems and as purgatives. methods: the antibacterial, antioxidant activities and phenolic contents of the methanol extracts of the leaves and stems of buddleja saligna were evaluated using in vitro standard methods. spectrophotometry was the basis for the determinations of total phenol, total flavonoids, flavonols, and proanthocyanidins. tannins, quercetin and catechin equivalents were used for these parameters. the antioxidant activities of the leaves and stem extracts of buddleja saligna were determined by abts, dpph, and ferrous reducing antioxidant property (frap) methods. laboratory isolates of 10 bacteria species which included five gram-positive and five gram-negative strains were used to assay for antibacterial activity of this plant. results: the antioxidant activities of the leaves as determined by the abts and dpph were similar to that of the stem. the flavonoids and the flavonols contents of the leaves were higher than that of the stem but the total phenols, proanthocyanidins and frap activities were higher in the methanol extracts of the stem. the extracts did show activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. for instance, while the methanol extract of the leaves showed good activities on  all the organisms except serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa at mics of between 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml, the extract of the stem only showed activities on bacillus cereus, streptococcus pyrogens and pseudomonas aeruginosa at the same concentration. conclusion: the results from this study indicate that the leaves and stem extracts of buddleja saligna possess antioxidant properties and could serve as free radical inhibitors or scavenger or, acting possibly as primary antioxidants. although, the antibacterial properties of buddleja saligna are not  as effective as the standard drugs-chloramphenicol and streptomycin, they still possess some activity against bacterial strains used in this study. buddleja saligna may therefore be a good candidate for functional foods as well as pharmaceutical plant-based products.

TI  == infections in patients with aplastic anemia.
AB  == infection is a major cause of death in patients with aplastic anemia (aa). there  are differences between the immunocompromised state of a patient with aa and the  patient who is neutropenic due to chemotherapy and this leads to a difference in  the infections that they incur. prolonged neutropenia is one of the largest risk  factors for the development of infections with the invasive mycoses and bacteria. recovery from neutropenia is directly related to survival, and supportive care plays a large role in protection while the patient is in a neutropenic state. the most common invasive mycoses include the aspergillus species, zygomycetes, candida spp., and fusarium spp. bacterial infections that are seen in patients with aa include gram-positive coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, enterococcus, staphylococus aureus, clostridium spp., micrococcus, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, listeria monocytogenes, and bacillus cereus. gram-negative infections including gram-negative bacilli, escherichia coli, salmonella, bacteroides fragilis, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumonia, aeromonas hydrophilia, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio vulnificus. viral infections are much less common but include those that belong to the herpesviridae family, community-acquired respiratory viral infection, and the viral hepatitides a, b, and c. evidence of the parasite strongyloides stercoralis has also been documented. this review discusses the major invasive fungal infections, bacterial pathogens, parasites, and viral infections that are found in patients with aa who are treated with immunosuppressive therapy. the specific  immune impairment and current treatment parameters for each of these classes of infection will also be discussed.

TI  == interventions for control of salmonella: clearance of microbial growth from rubber picker fingers.
AB  == a study was conducted to determine if a surface material with antimicrobial properties combined with an effective disinfectant could achieve total clearance  of bacterial contamination. before beginning the project, new rubber picker fingers collected from 3 processing facilities were tested for endogenous microflora. five species of bacteria common to soil and human handling were present: bacillus amyloliquefaciens, bacillus cereus/thuringiensis, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus hominis ssp. novobiosepticus, and staphylococcus intermedius. in separate experiments, new (unused) rubber picker fingers from 3 manufacturers were exposed to broiler carcass rinses, and the kinetics of bacterial attachment to finger material was determined. turbidity of  the bacterial suspensions at varying dilutions containing picker finger sections  was compared hourly with controls to evaluate inhibition. new rubber finger material from the 3 manufacturers significantly inhibited bacterial growth (p < 0.05), without the aid of antibacterial additives. we improved an assay for screening disinfectants against growth of pathogens and determined the activity of 5 disinfectant compounds. two of the compounds were most effective against pseudomonas aeruginosa, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enteritidis, and escherichia coli, and one of the compounds was selected for further study with salmonella enteritidis. scanning electron microscopy confirmed the levels of salmonella enteritidis before and after treatment. the most effective compound was nontoxic and completely cleared salmonella enteritidis contamination from the rubber picker finger surface.

TI  == synthesis, spectral characterization, in-vitro microbiological evaluation and cytotoxic activities of novel macrocyclic bis hydrazone.
AB  == a macrocyclic hydrazone schiff base was synthesized by reacting 1,4-dicarbonyl phenyl dihydrazide with 2,6-diformyl-4-methyl phenol and a series of metal complexes with this new schiff base were synthesized by reaction with co(ii), ni(ii) and cu(ii) metal salts. the schiff base and its complexes have been characterized by elemental analyses, ir, (1)h nmr, uv-vis, fab mass, esr spectra, fluorescence, thermal, magnetic and molar conductance data. the analytical data reveal that the co(ii), ni(ii) and cu(ii) complexes possess 2:1 metal-ligand ratios. all the complexes are non-electrolytes in dmf and dmso due to their low molar conductance values. infrared spectral data suggest that the hydrazone schiff base behaves as a hexadentate ligand with non non donor sequence towards the metal ions. the esr spectral data shows that the metal-ligand bond has considerable covalent character. the electrochemical behavior of the copper(ii) complex was investigated by cyclic voltammetry. the schiff base and its complexes have also been screened for their antibacterial (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, shigella dysentery, micrococcus, bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and antifungal activities (aspergillus niger, penicillium and candida albicans) by mic method. the brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in-vitro cytotoxic properties.

TI  == growth inhibition of foodborne and pathogenic bacteria by conjugated linoleic acid.
AB  == the influence of conjugated linoleic acid (cla) on the growth of some foodborne and pathogenic bacteria was examined. a potassium salt of cla (cla-k) was tested  against three gram-positive strains ( bacillus cereus , staphylococcus aureus , and streptococcus mutans ) and five gram-negative strains ( pseudomonas aeruginosa , salmonella typhimurium , vibrio parahemolyticus , klebsiella pneumoniae , and proteus mirabilis ). cla-k-mediated growth inhibition was evident for all tested strains, particularly the gram-positive strains. the ic(50) value of cla-k was 0.3 mm for b. cereus, 1.2 mm for s. aureus, and 0.3 mm  for s. mutans, whereas the value was 1.2 mm for k. pneumoniae, 1.2 mm for p. aeruginosa, 1.8 mm for s. typhimurium, 1.8 mm for v. parahemolyticus, and 2.4 mm  for p. mirabilis. the cla-k delayed the growth of all the tested strains at lower cla-k concentrations, but completely inhibited the growth at higher concentrations. all cells grown in the medium containing cla-k contained cla in their membranes and exhibited irregular cell surface and cell disruption, which were greater in gram-positive than gram-negative strains. higher lactic dehydrogenase activity (ldh), protein content, and malondialdehyde (mda) content  were evident in gram-positive strains than in gram-negative strains. these results suggest that the broad spectrum of growth inhibition by cla mediated through the lipid peroxidation of cla in the membranes and in the medium.

TI  == structure-activity relationship of antibacterial chalcones.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of 31 chalcones was tested against bacterial strains,  bacillus cereus atcc 11778, escherichia coli atcc 25922, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, and staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923. some of the tested chalcones showed fair to significant activity against gram-positive bacteria. by comparison of the results obtained, the antibacterial activity can be related to features such as the presence of a c-4 hydroxyl group, a c-4' oxygenated substituent or a  c-3' isoprenoid side chain, while the c-2' hydroxyl group might have importance for the stability of the molecule. the inhibitory effect of chalcones on human pathogenic microorganisms can be correlated with the substitution patterns of the aromatics rings.

TI  == comparative survey of putrescine production from agmatine deamination in different bacteria.
AB  == this article aims to study putrescine production in lactobacillus hilgardii strain x(1)b, an agmatine degrader isolated from wine, and to compare it with three other different species, previously reported as putrescine producers from agmatine: pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1, enterococcus faecalis atcc11700 and bacillus cereus cect 148(t). the effect of different biogenic amines, organic acids, cofactors, amino acids and sugars on putrescine production was evaluated.  in some cases, a similar effect was found in all the strains studied but the magnitude differed. arginine, glucose and fructose showed an inhibitory effect, whereas the presence of agmatine induced the production of putrescine in all microorganisms. in other cases, the effect differed between p. aeruginosa pao1 and the other microorganisms. histamine and tyramine poorly influenced the utilization of agmatine, although a small increase in putrescine production was observed in p. aeruginosa pao1. succinate, spermidine and spermine also led to an increase in putrescine production in p. aeruginosa pao1, whereas the succinate had no effect in the other microorganisms. spermine and spermidine always produced a diminution in agmatine deamination. in this work, we have also demonstrated that pyridoxal 5-phosphate, mg(2+) and mn(2+) had no effect on putrescine production from agmatine. results presented in this paper indicate differences in regulation mechanisms of agmatine deiminase pathway among p. aeruginosa pao1 and l. hilgardii x(1)b, e. faecalis atcc11700 and b. cereus cect  148(t). these results are significant from two points of view, first food quality, and second the toxicological and microbiological aspects. it should be taken into account that putrescine, whose origin is still controversial, is quantitatively the main biogenic amine found in food.

AB  == lactoperoxidase (lp) exerts antimicrobial effects in combination with h(2)o(2) and either thiocyanate (scn(-)) or a halide (e.g., i(-)). garlic extract in the presence of ethanol has also been used to activate the lp system. this study aimed to determine the effects of 3 lp activation systems (lp+scn(-)+h(2)o(2); lp+i(-)+h(2)o(2); lp + garlic extract + ethanol) on the growth and activity of 3  test organisms (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacillus cereus). sterilized milk was used as the reaction medium, and the growth pattern  of the organisms and a range of keeping quality (kq) indicators (ph, titratable acidity, ethanol stability, clot on boiling) were monitored during storage at the respective optimum growth temperature for each organism. the lp+i(-)+ h(2)o(2) system reduced bacterial counts below the detection limit shortly after treatment for all 3 organisms, and no bacteria could be detected for the duration of the experiment (35 to 55 h). the kq data confirmed that the milk remained unspoiled at the end of the experiments. the lp + garlic extract + ethanol system, on the other hand, had no effect on the growth or kq with p. aeruginosa, but showed a small retardation of growth of the other 2 organisms, accompanied by small increases (5 to 10 h) in kq. the effects of the lp+scn(-)+h(2)o(2) system were intermediate between those of the other 2 systems and differed between organisms. with p. aeruginosa, the system exerted total inhibition within 10 h of incubation, but the bacteria regained viability after a further 5 h, following a  logarithmic growth curve. this was reflected in the kq indicators, which implied  an extension of 15 h. with the other 2 bacterial species, lp+scn(-)+h(2)o(2) exerted an obvious inhibitory effect, giving a lag phase in the growth curve of 5 to 10 h and kq extension of 10 to 15 h. when used in combination, i(-) and scn(-) displayed negative synergy.

TI  == method for evaluation of the efficacy of antimicrobial preservatives in cosmetic  wet wipes.
AB  == many cosmetic formulations are now available in the form of wet wipes packaged in sealed sachets or packets. like the majority of cosmetic products having an aqueous phase, wipes are susceptible to microbial contamination and require the addition of preservatives. the efficacy of such preservatives can be evaluated using a standard challenge test performed on the wetting liquid but this test cannot be regarded as representative for this new type of formulation. the method presented here evaluates the efficacy of preservatives used in wet wipes kept in  their original packaging. dried inoculums were prepared by membrane filtration followed by drying in an incubator. the method is applicable to bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis), bacillus cereus spores and fungi (candida albicans and aspergillus niger). these inoculated carriers were inserted between two wipes in the original package, which was then re-sealed immediately. the test requires one dry inoculum per packet and one packet for each control or test. after incubation at 22.5 degrees c for 1, 2, 7, 14 or 28 days and, for the control, immediately after insertion of the membrane (time 0), microorganism counts were performed on the germ-carrier membranes as well as on adjacent wipes, after transfer into a suitable neutralizing agent. the membranes were shaken in the presence of glass beads and microorganisms were dissociated from the wipes by means of a stomacher. the supernatants recovered after being left to stand for 20 min are counted by pour plate method or membrane filtration. the feasibility of the method was demonstrated for each of the seven above-mentioned strains. the repeatability and reproducibility of the results obtained is similar to that obtained for preservative efficacy tests in the pharmacopoeias. the lethal rate of microorganisms during the preparation of dry inoculums ranges from 50 to 90% depending on the strain and the test (generally, a spontaneous reduction of about 1 log up to a maximum of 2 log). the recovery rate for microorganisms from dry inoculums (on membranes) at time 0 (control = t(0)) is around 90%, regardless of  the strain or the test. the number of microorganisms recovered from the wipes (w(0)) is between 2 and 10% of the number recovered from membranes (t(0)) and may be considered negligible. application of this method to different types of wipes  demonstrates that the efficacy of preservatives, expressed as the logarithmic reduction in the number of microorganisms at each time point, depends on the type of wipe and on the strain tested. the results obtained are considerably different from those found with the standard challenge tests applied to wetting liquids for wipes. the differences found confirm the need for a specific method applicable to wipes.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of plant essential oil combinations and interactions with food ingredients.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of plant essential oils  (eos) in combination and to investigate the effect of food ingredients on their efficacy. the eos assessed in combination included basil, lemon balm, marjoram, oregano, rosemary, sage and thyme. combinations of eos were initially screened against bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes and pseudomonas aeruginosa using the spot-on-agar test. the influence of varying concentrations of eo combinations on efficacy was also monitored using e. coli. these preliminary studies showed promising results for oregano in combination with basil, thyme or marjoram. the checkerboard method was then used to quantify the efficacy of oregano, marjoram or thyme in combination with the remainder of selected eos. fractional inhibitory concentrations (fic) were calculated and interpreted as synergy, addition, indifference or antagonism. all the oregano combinations showed additive efficacy against b. cereus, and oregano combined with marjoram, thyme or basil also had an additive effect against e. coli and p.  aeruginosa. the mixtures of marjoram or thyme also displayed additive effects in  combination with basil, rosemary or sage against l. monocytogenes. the effect of  food ingredients and ph on the antimicrobial efficacy of oregano and thyme was assessed by monitoring the lag phase and the maximum specific growth rate of l. monocytogenes grown in model media. the model media included potato starch (0, 1, 5 or 10%), beef extract (1.5, 3, 6 or 12%), sunflower oil (0, 1, 5 or 10%) and tsb at ph levels of 4, 5, 6 or 7. the antimicrobial efficacy of eos was found to  be a function of ingredient manipulation. starch and oils concentrations of 5% and 10% had a negative impact on the eo efficacy. on the contrary, the eos were more effective at high concentrations of protein, and at ph 5, by comparison with ph 6 or 7. this study suggests that combinations of eos could minimize application concentrations and consequently reduce any adverse sensory impact in  food. however, their application for microbial control might be affected by food  composition, therefore, careful selection of eos appropriate to the sensory and compositional status of the food system is required. this work shows that eos might be more effective against food-borne pathogens and spoilage bacteria when applied to ready to use foods containing a high protein level at acidic ph, as well as lower levels of fats or carbohydrates.

TI  == the electrostatic driving force for nucleophilic catalysis in l-arginine deiminase: a combined experimental and theoretical study.
AB  == l-arginine deiminase (adi) catalyzes the hydrolysis of l-arginine to form l-citrulline and ammonia via two partial reactions. a working model of the adi catalytic mechanism assumes nucleophilic catalysis by a stringently conserved active site cys and general acid-general base catalysis by a stringently conserved active site his. accordingly, in the first partial reaction, the cys attacks the substrate guanidino c zeta atom to form a tetrahedral covalent adduct, which is protonated by the his at the departing ammonia group to facilitate the formation of the cys- s-alkylthiouronium intermediate. in the second partial reaction, the his activates a water molecule for nucleophilic addition at the thiouronium c zeta atom to form the second tetrahedral intermediate, which eliminates the cys in formation of the l-citrulline product.  the absence of a basic residue near the cys thiol suggested that the electrostatic environment of the cys thiol, in the enzyme-substrate complex, stabilizes the cys thiolate anion. the studies described in this paper explore the mechanism of stabilization of the cys thiolate. first, the log(k(cat)/k(m)) and log k(cat) ph rate profiles were measured for several structurally divergent  adis to establish the ph range for adi catalysis. all adis were optimally active  at ph 5, which suggested that the cys pka is strongly perturbed by the prevailing electrostatics of the adi active site. the p k a of the bacillus cereus adi (bcadi) was determined by uv-ph titration to be 9.6. in contrast, the pka determined by iodoacetamide cys alkylation is 6.9. these results suggest that the negative electrostatic field from the two opposing asp carboxylates perturbs the  cys pka upward in the apoenzyme and that the binding of the iodoacetamide (a truncated analogue of the citrulline product) between the cys thiol and the two asp carboxylates shields the cys thiol, thereby reducing its pka. it is hypothesized that the bound positively charged guanidinium group of the l-arginine substrate further stabilizes the cys thiolate. the so-called "substrate-assisted" cys ionization, first reported by fast and co-workers to operate in the related enzyme dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase [stone, e.  m., costello, a. l., tierney, d. l., and fast, w. (2006) biochemistry 45, 5618-5630], was further explored computationally in adi by using an ab initio quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics method. the energy profiles for formation of the tetrahedral intermediate in the first partial reaction were calculated for three different reaction scenarios. from these results, we conclude that catalytic turnover commences from the active configuration of the adi(l-arginine) complex which consists of the cys thiolate (nucleophile) and his imidazolium ion  (general acid) and that the energy barriers for the nucleophilic addition of cys  thiolate to the thiouronium c zeta atom and his imidazolium ion-assisted elimination from the tetrahedral intermediate are small.

AB  == arginine deiminase (adi) catalyzes the hydrolytic conversion of l-arginine to ammonia and l-citrulline as part of the energy-producing l-arginine degradation pathway. the chemical mechanism for adi catalysis involves initial formation and  subsequent hydrolysis of a cys-alkylthiouronium ion intermediate. the structure of the pseudomonas aeruginosa adi-(l-arginine) complex guided the design of arginine analogs that might react with the adis to form inactive covalent adducts during catalytic turnover. one such candidate is l-canavanine, in which an n-methylene of l-arginine is replaced by an n-o. this substance was shown to be a slow substrate-producing o-ureido-l-homoserine. an in depth kinetic and mass spectrometric analysis of p. aeruginosa adi inhibition by l-canavanine showed that two competing pathways are followed that branch at the cys-alkylthiouronium  ion intermediate. one pathway leads to direct formation of o-ureido-l-homoserine  via a reactive thiouronium intermediate. the other pathway leads to an inactive form of the enzyme, which was shown by chemical model and mass spectrometric studies to be a cys-alkylisothiourea adduct. this adduct undergoes slow hydrolysis to form o-ureido-l-homoserine and regenerated enzyme. in contrast, kinetic and mass spectrometric investigations demonstrate that the cys-alkylthiouronium ion intermediate formed in the reaction of l-canavanine with bacillus cereus adi partitions between the product forming pathway (o-ureido-l-homoserine and free enzyme) and an inactivation pathway that leads to a stable cys-alkylthiocarbamate adduct. the adis from escherichia coli, burkholderia mallei, and giardia intestinalis were examined in order to demonstrate the generality of the l-canavanine slow substrate inhibition and to distinguish the kinetic behavior that defines the irreversible inhibition observed with the b. cereus adi from the time controlled inhibition observed with the p. aeruginosa, e. coli, b. mallei, and g. intestinalis adis.

TI  == comparative analysis of polyphenolic profiles and antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of tunisian pome fruit pulp and peel aqueous acetone extracts.
AB  == pome trees, apple, pear, and quince, are classified into the subfamily pomoideae, belonging to the rosaceae family. their autumnal fruits are consumed worldwide in different forms, that is, fresh or transformed into jams, jelly, juices, etc. their well-established beneficial properties to human health were found mainly related to their phenolic content. pulp and peel aqueous acetone extracts obtained from tunisian fruits at commercial maturity were comparatively evaluated for their phenolic profiles and antioxidant and antimicrobial potentials. the phenolic compounds present in the extracts were identified and quantified using rp-hplc-dad and esi-ms techniques. significant differences in the chromatographic profiles among these fruits, as well as between pulp and peel extracts of each fruit, were observed. quince, followed by 'red delicious', peel extracts showed the highest phenolic content (160.33 and 110.90 mg/100 g of fresh weight). the stronger inhibitory effect on dpph radicals corresponded to those obtained from peel materials. a comparative analysis of the antimicrobial potential against a range of microorganism strains was also carried out. staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacillus cereus were the most sensitive to the active extracts. among the examined phenolic extracts, 'red delicious' and quince peels  showed the highest effects for inhibiting bacteria growth. minimum inhibitory and bactericide concentrations ranged from 10(2) to 10(4) microg of polyphenol/ml. red skin apple and quince peels could be of great interest as important antioxidant and antimicrobial polyphenol sources.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of polyphenolic compounds isolated from plants of geraniaceae and rosaceae families].
AB  == polyphenolic compounds present in extracts of plants belonging to the families geraniaceae (blood-red cranesbill, wood cranesbill, meadow cranesbill, and alfilaria) and rosaceae (red raspberry, european dewberry, and tormentil) have been tested for their activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of the genera azotobacter, bacillus, and pseudomonas. the bacteriostatic activity exhibited some species-related features and depended on the polarity of the extracting agent. the bacteriostatic activity of plant-derived phenolic compounds correlated with their antioxidant potential. the plants of the families geraniaceae and rosaceae offer promise as a source of raw material for isolation  of polyphenolic compounds exhibiting bactericidal activity, including against opportunistic pathogens (b. cereus, e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus strains).

TI  == biodegradability of commercial and weathered diesel oils.
AB  == this work aimed to evaluate the capability of different microorganisms to degrade commercial diesel oil in comparison to a weathered diesel oil collected from the  groundwater at a petrol station. two microbiological methods were used for the biodegradability assessment: the technique based on the redox indicator 2,6 -dichlorophenol indophenol (dcpip) and soil respirometric experiments using biometer flasks. in the former we tested the bacterial cultures staphylococcus hominis, kocuria palustris, pseudomonas aeruginosa lbi, ochrobactrum anthropi and bacillus cereus, a commercial inoculum, consortia obtained from soil and groundwater contaminated with hydrocarbons and a consortium from an uncontaminated area. in the respirometric experiments it was evaluated the capability of the native microorganisms present in the soil from a petrol station to biodegrade the diesel oils. the redox indicator experiments showed that only the consortia, even that from an uncontaminated area, were able to biodegrade the weathered diesel. in 48 days, the removal of the total petroleum hydrocarbons (tph) in the respirometric experiments was approximately 2.5 times greater when the commercial diesel oil was used. this difference was caused by the consumption of labile hydrocarbons, present in greater quantities in the commercial diesel oil, as demonstrated by gas chromatographic analyses. thus, results indicate that biodegradability studies that do not consider the weathering effect of the pollutants may over estimate biodegradation rates and when the bioaugmentation is necessary, the best strategy would be that one based on injection of consortia, because even cultures with recognised capability of biodegrading hydrocarbons may fail when applied isolated.

TI  == human chitotriosidase is expressed in the eye and lacrimal gland and has an antimicrobial spectrum different from lysozyme.
AB  == chitotriosidase is a chitinolytic enzyme expressed by maturing macrophages and preformed in neutrophil granules, suggesting a role in antimicrobial defence. although available evidence supports a role in anti-fungal immunity, there is a lack of an obvious phenotype in humans homozygous for a mutation which renders chitotriosidase inactive. this may be explained by compensatory effects of enzymes co-expressed with chitotriosidase, such as lysozyme. we have found that chitinase is highly expressed in mouse and human eye, particularly in lacrimal glands. chitotriosidase is the only member of the chitinase/chilectin gene cluster expressed in the murine eye. as lacrimal glands also produce lysozyme, we have asked whether chitotriosidase, in addition to its documented anti-fungal effects, has synergistic anti-bacterial properties with lysozyme. the effect of recombinant chitotriosidase on the growth of five gram-positive (bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus aureus oata(+/-)) and two gram-negative strains (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa), were tested in a luminometric assay. recombinant chitotriosidase did not inhibit bacterial growth and did not synergize with lysozyme. though the expression of chitotriosidase in the eye supports a role in innate immunity, the  antimicrobial spectrum appears to be complementary to lysozyme and may indeed be  limited to fungi.

TI  == inhibitory effect of gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms against helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  == objectives: to determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several gram-negative  and gram-positive microorganisms against helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. methods: the in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against h. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. time-kill assay was performed with two staphylococcus spp. strains. results: anti-h. pylori activity was detected with saccharomyces cerevisiae, bacillus spp., 1 enterococcus faecium and 2 lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 h. pylori strains tested. all staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-h. pylori effect: one staphylococcus auricularis and two staphylococcus epidermidis against all h. pylori tested; staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hominis and s. auricularis against six, five and seven h. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative staphylococcus against one h. pylori strain. an inhibitory effect was detected with one escherichia coli against one h. pylori. klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella spp. and acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four h. pylori strains, and enterobacter cloacae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14  h. pylori isolates. no anti-h. pylori activity was detected with one lactobacillus spp., two lactococcus lactis, four streptococcus spp., one bacillus cereus, one e. faecium, one enterococcus faecalis, one e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella oxytoca. time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two staphylococcus spp. strains tested. conclusions: several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit h. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.

TI  == culture-based bacterial detection systems for platelets: the effect of time prior to sampling and duration of incubation required for detection with aerobic culture.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) products occurs at low concentrations requiring a period of incubation for growth to minimize sampling error. culture-based detection methods also need sufficient incubation time; together these periods may limit the useful life of plts. this study characterizes the impact of sampling and detection times with two commercially available bacteria detection products. study design and methods: apheresis plts inoculated with nine bacterial species at low concentrations were sampled immediately and 24 hours after inoculation. test results were analyzed after incubation at 16, 20, and 24 hours after sampling with two bacterial detection systems. results: when sampled immediately after inoculation, two commercially available bacterial detection systems (bact/alert, biomerieux; and ebds, pall corp.) failed to detect some plts inoculated with staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia liquefaciens, or pseudomonas aeruginosa and s. epidermidis, s. liquefaciens, bacillus cereus, or p. aeruginosa, respectively. the bact/alert was better at 20 hours (p<0.02), but not at 16 or 24 hours for time 0 sampling. when  sampling occurred 24 hours after inoculation, there were no difference between the two systems. conclusion: results suggest that for either bacteria detection system, holding plts for 24 hours before sampling improves the detection sensitivity for plts contaminated with low concentrations of bacteria, and longer incubation periods improve detection.

TI  == effect of natural preservatives on the growth of histamine producing bacteria.
AB  == present study deals with the hampering of the growth of histamine producing bacteria (hpb), by using nacl and spices which are easily available and cheaper cost wise. for this experiment, four strains of hpb viz. vibrio parahaemolyticus, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis were tested against 1 to 10% concentrations of nacl and 1 to 5% concentrations of natural preservatives (turmeric, ginger and garlic) in a basal medium. hpb showed different growth rates at different concentrations of nacl and natural preservatives. v. parahaemolyticus, b. cereus and ps. aeruginosa showed no growth at 10% concentration. when the hpb growth was tested with garlic, turmeric and ginger extracts, growth of all the bacteria was inhibited by garlic and turmeric  extracts at 5% concentration. in ginger, v. parahaemolyticus, b. cereus and p. mirabilis were totally inhibited at 5% concentration. but ps. aeruginosa showed very less growth at this concentration.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of two antitumour agents and ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and the acetate form of its copper(ii) chelate.
AB  == some copper chelates have potent antitumour activity, and in some cases also the  free ligands have activity in vivo. yet, little is known about their antimicrobial properties. copper(ii) chelates of the thiosemicarbazones of a-n-heterocyclic carboxaldehydes constitute one important group of such agents, also their ligands having marked antitumour activity. both the ligands and chelates inhibit ribonucleotide reductase. some ligands have been or are under clinical trials as antineoplastic agents. i report here a study on the antimicrobial properties of the prototype compounds of this group, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and its copper(ii) chelate. they were tested against nine microbes, including bacteria (bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus lactis), yeasts (candida albicans and saccharomyces cerevisiae) and one mold (aspergillus niger). two clinical isolates of bacillus sp. and one reference strain were also studied. both the ligand and the chelate had marked activity. the ligand displayed considerable activity against all bacteria except  for s. lactis, and its activity against e. coli and p. aeruginosa was that high that practical applications might be considued. it was highly active against a. niger and moderately active against c. albicans. the chelate was highly active against s. epidermidis and s. cerevisiae. both compounds inhibited the clinical isolates markedly. since some related ligands have been or are in clinical trials on humans or are entering them, their route to clinical use, also as antimicrobials, might be much more straightforward than that of substances, whose toxicity in humans is wholly unexplored.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of substituted salicylaldehydes and related compounds.
AB  == a systematic survey of the antimicrobial properties of substituted salicylaldehydes and some related aromatic aldehydes is reported. a total of 23 different compounds, each at four different concentrations, were studied using a  panel of seven microbes (aspergillus niger, bacillus cereus, candida albicans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, saccharomyces cerevisiae and staphylococcus epidermidis) and employing the paper disc agar diffusion method. several aldehydes, most notably halogenated, nitro-substituted and hydroxylated salicylaldehydes, displayed highly potent activity against the microbes studied,  giving inhibitory zones up to 49 mm in diameter (paper disc diameter 6 mm), while unsubstituted benzaldehyde and salicylaldehyde had minimal activity. further, 4,6-dimethoxysalicylaldehyde had considerable activity against c albicans and slight activity against s. cerevisiae, while displaying minimal activity against  bacteria. also two aromatic dialdehydes had interesting activity. in general, p.  aeruginosa was the least sensitive microbe, a result that is in line with observations from a large screening project, in which this microbe was the one against which the least number of active substances was found. interestingly, the structure-activity relationships of the aldehydes studied were clearly different  for different microbes. many of the aldehydes tested had such high antimicrobial  activity that they are noteworthy candidates for practical applications as well as interesting lead compounds for the development of novel antimicrobial drugs and disinfectants. the structure-activity relationships are discussed in detail.  for high activity, substituents are required in benzaldehyde as well as in its 2-hydroxy derivative salicylaldehyde. one hydroxy group alone (at the 2-position) is not enough, but further hydroxylation may produce high activity. the effects of substituents are in some cases dramatic. halogenation, hydroxylation and nitro substitution may produce highly active compounds, but the effects are not easily  predicted nor can they be extrapolated from one microbe to another.

TI  == carbohydrazones of substituted salicylaldehydes as potential lead compounds for the development of narrow-spectrum antimicrobials.
AB  == certain substituted salicylaldehydes are known to have highly potent antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi, but the mechanism underlying this remarkable activity is not known, and almost nothing has been reported on the effects of further modification of the structures, such as the formation of hydrazone-type derivatives. we report now a study on the antimicrobial properties of the carbohydrazone derivatives of several substituted salicylaldehydes. the compounds studied were synthesized from ring-substituted salicylaldehydes and carbohydrazide in the mole ratio 2:1. they were tested against aspergillus niger, bacillus cereus, candida albicans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, saccharomyces cerevisiae and staphylococcus epidermidis using the agar diffusion  method. the carbohydrazone derived from 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzaldehyde had distinctly higher activity than the parent aldehyde in the same molar concentration. this activity was limited to one test organism (s. epidermidis), while the free aldehyde had at least some (in some cases even high) activity against all of the microbes studied. all other ones of the effective carbohydrazone compounds were distinctly less active than the parent salicylaldehydes as such. the hydrazones studied had in general a narrower antimicrobial spectrum than the free aldehydes and are thus of interest as potential lead compounds for the development of narrow-spectrum anti-microbial drugs. the mechanism of action of the aldehydes as well as that of the carbohydrazones is discussed.

TI  == broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of the reactive compounds generated in vitro by manduca sexta phenoloxidase.
AB  == although quinone production and melanin formation are widely recognized as an integral part of the insect defense system, experimental evidence is lacking that the proteolytic activation of prophenoloxidase participates in the direct killing of invading microbes-active phenoloxidase generates quinones that polymerize to form melanin. here, we report the antimicrobial effect of reactive intermediates  produced in phenoloxidase-catalyzed reactions. after being treated with manduca sexta phenoloxidase and dopamine, escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis ceased to grow, whereas the growth of pichia pastoris was slightly affected. microscopic analysis showed melanin deposition on cell surface, aggregation of bacteria, and  loss of cell mobility. viability tests revealed major decreases in the bacterial  colony counts and, since the decrease remained significant after dispersion of the cell clumps, the reactive compounds were surmised to have aggregated and killed e. coli and b. subtilis cells. under the experimental conditions, 60-94% of the gram-negative bacteria (e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium) and 52-99% of the gram-positive bacteria  (bacillus cereus, b. subtilis, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus) were killed. in the presence of phenoloxidase, dopamine or 5,6-dihydroxyindole (dhi) exhibited much higher antibacterial activity than l-dopa, n-acetyldopamine  (nada) or n-beta-alanyldopamine (nbad) did, suggesting that dhi and its oxidation products were cytotoxic. the antifungal activity of dhi was detected using p. pastoris, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida albicans, and beauveria bassiana. these results established that prophenoloxidase activation is an integral component of the insect defense system involving a multitude of enzymes (e.g. proteinases, oxidases, and dopachrome conversion enzyme (dce)), which immobilizes and kills invading microorganisms.

AB  == objectives: to investigate the bactericidal activity of antiviral and anticancer  nucleoside analogues against a variety of pathogenic bacteria and characterize the activating enzymes, deoxyribonucleoside kinases (dnks). methods: several fda-approved nucleoside analogue drugs were screened for their potential bactericidal activity against several clinical bacterial isolates and type strains. we identified and subcloned the genes coding for putative deoxyribonucleoside kinases in escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, salmonella enterica, yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and listeria monocytogenes. these genes were tested for their ability to increase the susceptibility of a dnk-deficient e. coli strain to various analogues. we overexpressed, purified and characterized the substrate specificity and kinetic properties of the recombinant enzymes from s. enterica and b. cereus. results: the tested gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (azt) in the concentration range 0.032-31.6 microm except for a single e. coli isolate and two pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates which were resistant to the tested azt concentrations. purified recombinant s. enterica thymidine kinase phosphorylated azt efficiently with a km of 73.3 microm and k(cat)/km of 6.6 x 10(4) s(-1) m(-1) and is the activator of this drug in vivo. 2',2'-difluoro-2'-deoxycytidine (gemcitabine) was a potent antibiotic against gram-positive bacteria in the concentration range between 0.001 and 1.0 microm. the b. cereus deoxyadenosine kinase had a km for gemcitabine of 33.5 microm and k(cat)/km of 5.1 x 10(3) s(-1) m(-1) and activates gemcitabine in vivo. s. enterica and b. cereus are now amongst the first bacteria with a completely characterized set of dnk enzymes. conclusions: bacterial dnks efficiently activate nucleoside analogues in a species-specific manner. therefore, nucleoside analogues have a potential to be employed as antibiotics in the fight against emerging multiresistant bacteria.

TI  == vapor-phase activities of cinnamon, thyme, and oregano essential oils and key constituents against foodborne microorganisms.
AB  == the aim of the study presented here was to gain knowledge about the vapor-phase antimicrobial activity of selected essential oils and their major putatively active constituents against a range of foodborne bacterial and fungal strains. in a first step, the vapor-phase antimicrobial activities of three commercially available essential oils (eos)-cinnamon (cinnamomum zeylanicum), thyme (thymus vulgaris), and oregano (origanum vulgare)-were evaluated against a wide range of  microorganisms, including gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella choleraesuis), gram-positive bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis), molds (penicillium islandicum and aspergillus flavus), and a yeast (candida albicans). the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were generally lower for oregano eo than for the thyme and cinnamon eos, especially against the relatively resistant gram-negative. the persistence of the eos' antimicrobial activities over time was assessed, and changes in the composition of the atmosphere they generated over time were determined using single-drop microextraction (sdme) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) and subsequent analysis of the data by principal component analysis (pca). more relevant chemicals were selected. in addition, the vapor-phase activities of putatively key constituents of the oils were screened against representative gram-positive (l. monocytogenes) and gram-negative (s. choleraesuis) bacteria, a mold (a. flavus), and a yeast (c. albicans). of the tested compounds, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and carvacrol showed the strongest antimicrobial effectiveness, so their mics, defined as the minimum vapor concentrations that completely inhibited detectable growth of the microorganisms, were calculated. to check for possible interactions between components present in the eos, cinnamon eo was fortified with cinnamaldehyde and thyme eo with thymol,  and then the antimicrobial activities of the fortified oils were compared to those of the respective unfortified eos using fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) indices and by plotting inhibition curves as functions of the vapor-phase concentrations. synergistic effects were detected for cinnamaldehyde on a. flavus and for thymol on l. monocytogenes, s. choleraesuis, and a. flavus. in all other  cases the fortification had additive effects, except for cinnamaldehyde's activity against s. choleraesuis, for which the effect was antagonistic. finally, various microorganisms were found to cause slight changes over time to the atmospheres generated by all of the eos (fortified and unfortified) except the fortified cinnamon eo.

TI  == application of real-time quantitative pcr for the detection of selected bacterial pathogens during municipal wastewater treatment.
AB  == bacteria were detected at five stages of municipal wastewater treatment using taqman(r) real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr). thirteen probe and primer sets were  tested for diverse pathogens that may be present in wastewater, including aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, helicobacter pylori, klebsiella pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella sp., and staphylococcus aureus. the sensitivity of the assay was 100 fg of genomic dna (=22 gene copies), based on a standard curve generated using a. hydrophila purified dna. samples from five stages of wastewater treatment were collected, including raw wastewater, primary effluents, mixed liquor, waste activated sludge and final effluents. in duplicate samples, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, c. perfringens and e. faecalis were detected throughout the wastewater process, and their numbers decreased by 3.52-3.98, 4.23-4.33, 3.15-3.39, and 3.24 orders of magnitude respectively, between the raw wastewater  and final effluent stage. this qpcr method was effective for the detection of pathogens in wastewater and confirmed that the risk of exposure to pathogens in the wastewater discharge was well within the environment canada guidelines.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == ceramidase enhances phospholipase c-induced hemolysis by pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == we previously reported the purification, molecular cloning, and characterization  of a neutral ceramidase from pseudomonas aeruginosa strain an17 (okino, n., tani, m., imayama, s., and ito, m. (1998) j. biol. chem. 273, 14368-14373; okino, n., ichinose, s., omori, a., imayama, s., nakamura, t., and ito, m. (1999) j. biol. chem. 274, 36616-36622). interestingly, the gene encoding the enzyme is adjacent  to that encoding hemolytic phospholipase c (plch) in the genome of pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a well known pathogen for opportunistic infections. we report here that simultaneous production of plch and ceramidase was induced by several lipids and plch-induced hemolysis was significantly enhanced by the action of the ceramidase. when the strain was cultured with sphingomyelin or phosphatidylcholine, production of both enzymes drastically increased, causing the increase of hemolytic activity in the cell-free culture supernatant. ceramide and sphingosine were also effective in promoting the production of ceramidase but not that of plch. furthermore, we found that the hemolytic activity of a bacillus cereus sphingomyelinase was significantly enhanced by addition of a recombinant pseudomonas ceramidase. tlc analysis of the erythrocytes showed that ceramide produced from sphingomyelin by the sphingomyelinase was partly converted to sphingosine by the ceramidase. a ceramidase-null mutant strain caused much less hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes than did the wild-type strain. sphingosine was detected in the erythrocytes co-cultured with the wild-type strain but not the mutant strain. finally, we found that the enhancement of plch-induced hemolysis by the ceramidase occurred in not only sheep but also human erythrocytes. these results may indicate that the ceramidase enhances the plch-induced cytotoxicity and provide new insights into the role of sphingolipid-degrading enzymes in the pathogenicity of p. aeruginosa.

AB  == the microbial composition of the air in various areas of a high-throughput chicken-slaughtering facility was investigated. over a 4-mo period, 6 processing  areas were sampled, and the influence of environmental factors was monitored. the highest counts of microorganisms were recorded in the initial stages of processing, comprising the receiving-killing and defeathering areas, whereas counts decreased toward the evisceration, air-chilling, packaging, and dispatch areas. maximum microbial counts were as follows: coliforms, 4.9 x 10(3) cfu/m(3); escherichia coli 3.4 x 10(3) cfu/m(3); bacillus cereus, 5.0 x 10(4) cfu/m(3); staphylococcus aureus, 1.6 x 10(4) cfu/m(3); pseudomonas aeruginosa, 7.0 x 10(4)  cfu/m(3); presumptive salmonella spp., 1.5 x 10(4) cfu/m(3); listeria monocytogenes, 1.6 x 10(4) cfu/m(3); and fungi, 1.4 x 10(4) cfu/m(3). higher counts of airborne microorganisms found in the receiving-killing and defeathering areas indicate the importance of controlling microbial levels before processing to prevent the spread of organisms downstream. this should limit the risk of carrying over contaminants from areas known to generate high counts to areas where the final food product is exposed to air and surface contamination.

TI  == evolution of surveillance methods for detection of bacterial contamination of platelets in a university hospital, 1991 through 2004.
AB  == background: platelet (plt) bacterial contamination (pbc) is the most common transfusion-associated infection. it is important to understand the impact of interventions addressing this problem. study design and methods: pbc was studied  by prospective (active) and transfusion-reaction triggered (passive) surveillance from july 1991 to december 2004. active surveillance, utilized for 10 years, included bacterial culture of all or 4- and 5-day-old plts at issue and intermittent use of gram stain, ph measurements, and early (24-hr) culture of single-donor plateletpheresis (sdp) units. results: active surveillance detected  38 instances of pbc, 7 in sdp units (1:2213) and 31 in random-donor plt units (1:2090 units, p = 0.89; or 1:418 pools of 5 units, p < 0.001). contaminants were coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; n = 27), staphylococcus aureus (4), bacillus cereus (1), serratia marcescens (2), streptococci (2 s. bovis, 1 s. uberis), and cons with viridans group streptococcus (1). only one instance of contamination, caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, was detected by passive surveillance, with fatal outcome. colony counts of contaminants ranged from 0.5 x 10(2) to 4 x 10(11) colony-forming units per ml at time of issue. pbc was interdicted before transfusion in 6 cases through gram stain screening. transfusion reactions occurred in 13 of 32 recipients (41%), with 9 severe reactions (28%) and 3 deaths (9%). ph testing failed to detect 5 contaminated units and resulted in discard of nearly 2 percent of units, whereas culture of sdp units at 24 hours failed to identify a contaminated unit. conclusion: improved active surveillance methods for detecting pbc are needed to improve the  safety of plt transfusions.

TI  == search for antibacterial and antifungal agents from selected indian medicinal plants.
AB  == a series of 61 indian medicinal plants belonging to 33 different families used in various infectious disorders, were screened for their antimicrobial properties. screening was carried out at 1000 and 500 microg/ml concentrations by agar dilution method against bacillus cereus var mycoides, bacillus pumilus, bacillus  subtilis, bordetella bronchiseptica, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa, streptococcus faecalis, candida albicans, aspergillus niger and saccharomyces cerevisiae. twenty-eight plant extracts showed activity against at  least one of the test organisms used in the screening. on the basis of the results obtained, we conclude that the crude extracts of dorema ammoniacum, sphaeranthus indicus, dracaena cinnabari, mallotus philippinensis, jatropha gossypifolia, aristolochia indica, lantana camara, nardostachys jatamansi, randia dumetorum and cassia fistula exhibited significant antimicrobial activity and properties that support folkloric use in the treatment of some diseases as broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. this probably explains the use of these plants by the indigenous people against a number of infections.

TI  == screening for antimicrobial activity of ten medicinal plants used in colombian folkloric medicine: a possible alternative in the treatment of non-nosocomial infections.
AB  == background: the antimicrobial activity and minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of the extracts of bidens pilosa l., bixa orellana l., cecropia peltata l., cinchona officinalis l., gliricidia sepium h.b. & k, jacaranda mimosifolia d.don, justicia secunda vahl., piper pulchrum c.dc, p. paniculata l. and spilanthes americana hieron were evaluated against five bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus beta hemolitic, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli), and one yeast (candida albicans). these plants are used in colombian folk medicine to treat infections of microbial origin. methods: plants  were collected by farmers and traditional healers. the ethanol, hexane and water  extracts were obtained by standard methods. the antimicrobial activity was found  by using a modified agar well diffusion method. all microorganisms were obtained  from the american type culture collection (atcc). mic was determined in the plant extracts that showed some efficacy against the tested microorganisms. gentamycin  sulfate (1.0 microg/ml), clindamycin (0.3 microg/ml) and nystatin (1.0 microg/ml) were used as positive controls. results: the water extracts of bidens pilosa l.,  jacaranda mimosifolia d.don, and piper pulchrum c.dc showed a higher activity against bacillus cereus and escherichia coli than gentamycin sulfate. similarly,  the ethanol extracts of all species were active against staphylococcus aureus except for justicia secunda. furthermore, bixa orellana l, justicia secunda vahl. and piper pulchrum c.dc presented the lowest mics against escherichia coli (0.8,  0.6 and 0.6 microg/ml, respectively) compared to gentamycin sulfate (0.9 8 g/ml). likewise, justicia secunda and piper pulchrum c.dc showed an analogous mic against candida albicans (0.5 and 0.6 microg/ml, respectively) compared to nystatin (0.6 microg/ml). bixa orellana l, exhibited a better mic against bacillus cereus (0.2 microg/ml) than gentamycin sulfate (0.5 microg/ml). conclusion: this in vitro study corroborated the antimicrobial activity of the selected plants used in folkloric medicine. all these plants were effective against three or more of the pathogenic microorganisms. however, they were ineffective against streptococcus beta hemolytic and pseudomonas aeruginosa. their medicinal use in infections associated with these two species is not recommended. this study also showed that bixa orellana l, justicia secunda vahl.  and piper pulchrum c.dc could be potential sources of new antimicrobial agents.

TI  == acceleration of epithelial cell syndecan-1 shedding by anthrax hemolytic virulence factors.
AB  == background: it has been recently reported that major pathogens staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa accelerate a normal process of cell surface syndecan-1 (synd1) ectodomain shedding as a mechanism of host damage due to the production of shedding-inducing virulence factors. we tested if acceleration of synd1 shedding takes place in vitro upon treatment of epithelial cells with b. anthracis hemolysins, as well as in vivo during anthrax infection in mice. results: the isolated anthrax hemolytic proteins anlb (sphingomyelinase) and anlo (cholesterol-binding pore-forming factor), as well as clna (b. cereus homolog of  b. anthracis phosphatidyl choline-preferring phospholipase c) cause accelerated shedding of synd1 and e-cadherin from epithelial cells and compromise epithelial  barrier integrity within a few hours. in comparison with hemolysins in a similar  range of concentrations, anthrax lethal toxin (lt) also accelerates shedding albeit at slower rate. individual components of lt, lethal factor and protective  antigen are inactive with regard to shedding. inhibition experiments favor a hypothesis that activities of tested bacterial shedding inducers converge on the  stimulation of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases of the syk family, ultimately leading to activation of cellular sheddase. both lt and anlo modulate erk1/2 and p38 mapk signaling pathways, while jnk pathway seems to be irrelevant to accelerated shedding. accelerated shedding of synd1 also takes place in dba/2 mice challenged with bacillus anthracis (sterne) spores. elevated levels of shed ectodomain are readily detectable in circulation after 24 h. conclusion: the concerted acceleration of shedding by several virulence factors could represent a new pathogenic mechanism contributing to disruption of epithelial or endothelial integrity, hemorrhage, edema and abnormal cell signaling during anthrax infection.

TI  == basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: flow cytometry (facs) is a common technique in blood banking. it is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. it was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (pcs).  study design and methods: plasma-reduced pcs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees c for various times. the following 10 species were used: bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica. bacterial dna was stained with thiazole orange. after the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by facs. results: all bacteria species used were detectable by facs. the lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microl, that is, 10(5) per ml. in general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. in one  case (k. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with  that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. when pc samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per ml of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees c, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. exceptions were e. cloacae and p. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. at 20 to 24 degrees c, the detection times were strongly prolonged. conclusion: sterility testing of pcs by facs is a feasible approach. the present  data suggest incubating pc samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees c before testing. for slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1  to 2 days.

TI  == antioxidant and biocidal activities of carum nigrum (seed) essential oil, oleoresin, and their selected components.
AB  == in the present study, chemical constituents of the essential oil and oleoresin of the seed from carum nigrum obtained by hydrodistillation and soxhlet extraction using acetone, respectively, have been studied by gc and gc-ms techniques. the major component was dillapiole (29.9%) followed by germacrene b (21.4%), beta-caryophyllene (7.8%), beta-selinene (7.1%), and nothoapiole (5.8%) along with many other components in minor amounts. seventeen components were identified in the oleoresin (table 2) with dillapiole as a major component (30.7%). it also  contains thymol (19.1%), nothoapiole (15.2.3%), and gamma-elemene (8.0%). the antioxidant activity of both the essential oil and oleoresin was evaluated in mustard oil by monitoring peroxide, thiobarbituric acid, and total carbonyl and p-anisidine values of the oil substrate. the results showed that both the essential oil and oleoresin were able to reduce the oxidation rate of the mustard oil in the accelerated condition at 60 degrees c in comparison with synthetic antioxidants such as butylated hydroxyanisole and butylated hydroxytoluene at 0.02%. in addition, individual antioxidant assays such as linoleic acid assay, dpph scavenging activity, reducing power, hydroxyl radical scavenging, and chelating effects have been used. the c. nigrum seed essential oil exhibited complete inhibition against bacillus cereus and pseudomonas aeruginosa at 2000 and 3000 ppm, respectively, by agar well diffusion method. antifungal activity was determined against a panel of foodborne fungi such as aspergillus niger, penicillium purpurogenum, penicillium madriti, acrophialophora fusispora, penicillium viridicatum, and aspergillus flavus. the fruit essential oil showed 100% mycelial zone inhibition against p. purpurogenum and a. fusispora at 3000 ppm in the poison food method. hence, both oil and oleoresin could be used as an  additive in food and pharmaceutical preparations after screening.

TI  == characterization of contamination in and toxicities of a shipyard area in hong kong.
AB  == this is the first integrated study on the contaminant characterization and toxicities of a shipyard area. this site in hong kong contained 3.6-33.4 mg kg(-1) dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and 5-79 g kg(-1) oil and grease. other pollutants exceeding the dutch intervention values were total polyaromatic hydrocarbons, total petroleum hydrocarbons, and metals cu, pb and zn. these pollutants persisted partially owing to the poor fertility with <125 mg n kg(-1)  and <530 mg p kg(-1) typical of coastal soil. sediments collected within 100 m also showed contamination exceeding the china and hong kong intervention levels.  the shipyard soil killed two bacteria pseudomonas stutzeri and acinetobacter sp.  isolated from a clean coastal soil, inhibited germination of three exogenous plants triticum aestivum, brassica chinense and lolium perenne, and inhibited proliferation of three indigenous bacteria: methylobacterium sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus cereus. thus, ex situ remediation was needed.

TI  == differential activity of a lectin from solieria filiformis against human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == a lectin isolated from the red alga solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). the lectin (500 microg/ml) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus sp, and pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/ml but the lectin (10-1000 microg/ml) had no effect on  the growth of the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and b. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. the purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. it is possible that the interaction of s. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium b. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml. the stimulation of the growth of b.  cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/ml), its hapten. thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. the present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.

TI  == use of oligonucleotide array for identification of six foodborne pathogens and pseudomonas aeruginosa grown on selective media.
AB  == identification of presumptive foodborne pathogens grown on selective media may take one to several days and requires a different battery of biochemical tests for each microorganism. a molecular identification method was developed in which  universal primers were used to amplify the 16s to 23s rdna intergenic spacer of target microorganisms, and pcr products were hybridized to a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides that were immobilized on a nylon membrane. the  seven target microorganisms were bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella, staphylococcus aureus, and vibrio parahaemolyticus. after testing a large collection of target bacteria (29  to 51 strains) and nontarget bacteria (> 500 strains), the performances (sensitivity and specificity) of the oligonucleotide array were as follows: b. cereus (100 and 77%), e. coli (100 and 100%), l. monocytogenes (100 and 90%), p.  aeruginosa (100 and 100%), salmonella (100 and 100%), s. aureus (100 and 100%), and v. parahaemolyticus (100 and 94.2%). other species in the b. cereus group cross-hybridized to the probes used for identification of b. cereus, and positive results should be confirmed by additional morphological observation of colonies.  listeria innocua cross-reacted with probes used to identify l. monocytogenes, but a simple hemolysis test was used to differentiate the two species. some strains of vibrio harveyi and vibrio mimicus cross-hybridized with probes used for identification of v. parahaemolyticus and caused false-positive reactions. the advantage of the array is that a common protocol was used to identify the seven target microorganisms and multiple different microorganisms could be simultaneously identified on a single array.

TI  == optimal sampling time after preparation of platelet concentrates for detection of bacterial contamination by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background and objectives: a universal quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr), based on bacterial 16s rdna, to detect bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates (pcs), was developed previously and compared with automated culturing. in the present study, this real-time pcr method was evaluated to determine the optimal sampling time for screening of bacterial contamination in pcs. materials and methods: routinely prepared pcs were spiked with suspensions of escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and propionibacterium acnes to 1, 10 and 100 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml and stored at room temperature for 7 days. the presence of bacteria in these pcs was monitored by quantitative real-time pcr. as a reference method (additional control), bact/alert automated culturing was used. for pcr, 1-ml aliquots were drawn from all (spiked) pcs on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 of storage. as a control, triplicate samples (10 ml) were inoculated into aerobic and anaerobic bact/alert culture bottles immediately after spiking (day 0) and after  storage for 1, 2, 3, 6 or 7 days. results: with quantitative real-time pcr, all bacterial species tested were reproducibly detected on day 1 after spiking at original concentrations of 10 and 100 cfu/ml. bacteria were also detected on day  1 from pcs spiked with an initial concentration of 1 cfu/ml, except for e. coli,  which was detected in only one of the three samples and p. aeruginosa, for which  analysis was not performed on day 1. with the reference method, bacteria were detected in culture bottles (inoculated on day 0) within a mean time of 20.1 h, with the exception of p. acnes which was detected at a mean time of 102.3 and 49.3 h (for original spiking concentrations of 10 and 100 cfu/ml respectively). conclusions: pcr enables the rapid detection of low initial numbers of bacteria in pcs. for reliable detection, our results support that sampling of pcs for real-time pcr screening should not be carried out earlier than 1 day after preparation (48 h after blood collection). importantly, the real-time pcr approach has the potential to be used before the release of pcs from the blood centre or shortly before they are transfused in the hospital.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of essential oils (eos) of cinnamon (cinnamon zeylanicum), clove (syzygium aromaticum), basil (ocimum basillicum), rosemary (rosmarinus officinalis), dill (anethum graveolens), and ginger (zingiber officinalis) was evaluated over a range of concentrations in two types of contact tests (solid and vapor diffusion). the eos were tested against an array of four gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, and listeria monocytogenes), four gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella choleraesuis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three fungi (a yeast, candida albicans, and two molds, penicillium islandicum and aspergillus flavus). the rationale for this work was to test the possibility of creating a protective atmosphere by using natural compounds that could extend the shelf life of packaged foodstuffs while minimizing organoleptic alterations. in the solid diffusion tests, cinnamon and clove gave the strongest (and very similar) inhibition, followed by basil and rosemary, with dill and ginger giving the weakest inhibition. the fungi were the  most sensitive microorganisms, followed by the gram-positive bacterial strains. the gram-negative strain p. aeruginosa was the least inhibited. the composition of the atmosphere generated by the eos, and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), were determined using a disk volatilization method, in which no inhibition from rosemary or basil was observed. cinnamon and clove, once again, gave similar results for every microorganism. as a general rule, mic (fungi) << mic (bacteria) with no clear differences between gram-positive or -negative strains except for p. aeruginosa, which was not inhibited by any of the eos in the vapor phase. the atmosphere generated from the eos was analyzed by means of solid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry. differences among the volatiles in the eos, which may be responsible for the differences in their antimicrobial performances, were found.

TI  == in-house validation of the bactec 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: at present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the fda for the purpose of quality control (qc) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates: the bact/alert blood culture system (biomerieux) and the pall ebds (pall corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived plts. after the decision of the aabb to institute universal qc testing of plt concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the  performance of our current blood culture system, the bactec 9240, was carried out for this purpose. study design and methods: serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with plt contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis plt unit per organism. four ml of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (cfus) per ml was inoculated into blood culture bottles (standard 10 aerobic/f, becton-dickinson diagnostic systems) and incubated in a bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to  insure the identity of bacterial growth. results: with the exception of streptococcus mitis, the bactec system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 cfus per ml for staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the limit of detection for the  s. mitis test strain was 61 cfus per ml. detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis plt products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. conclusion: this study validates the use of the bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis plts in  less than 24 hours.

TI  == detection and identification of bacteria in a juice matrix with fourier transform-near infrared spectroscopy and multivariiate analysis.
AB  == the use of fourier transform-near infrared (ft-nir) spectroscopy combined with multivariate pattern recognition techniques was evaluated to address the need for a fast and senisitive method for the detection of bacterial contamination in liquids. the complex cellular composition of bacteria produces ft-nir vibrational transitions (overtone and combination bands), forming the basis for identification and subtyping. a database including strains of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, and bacillus thuringiensis was built, with special care taken to optimize sample preparation.  the bacterial cells were treated with 70% (vol/vol) ethanolto enhance safe handling of pathogenic strains and then concentrated on an aluminum oxide membrane to obtain a thin bacterial film. this simple membrane filtration procedure generated reproducible ft-nir spectra that allowed for the rapid discrimination among closely related strains. principal component analysis and soft independent modeling of class analogy of transformed spectra in the region 5,100 to 4,400 cm(-1) were able to discriminate between bacterial species. spectroscopic analysis of apple juices inoculated with different strains of e. coli at approximately 10(5) cfu/ml showed that ft-nir spectralfeatures are consistent with bacterial contamination and soft independent modeling of class analogy correctly predicted the identity of the contaminant as strains of e. coli. ft-nir in conjunction with multivariate techniques can be used for the rapid and accurate evaluation of potential bacterial contamination in liquids with minimal sample manipulation, and hence limited exposure of the laboratory worker to the agents.

TI  == [interaction of neomycin with other antibiotics on selected bacterial strains].
AB  == antimicrobial combinations are used most frequently to provide broad-spectrum empirical coverage in the treatment of bacterial infections. however, combination of two antibiotics may not influence their activity, may lead to synergy or antagonism in the activity. neomycin may be combined with one of the following antibiotics: ampicillin, procaine penicillin, gramicidin, bacitracin, polymyxin b, lincomycin, oxytetracycline, and erythromycin in some human and veterinary multiantibiotic drugs distributed in poland. the checkerboard method has been one of the traditional assays for the measurement of antibiotic interactions. the aim of this study was to analyse the activity interaction of neomycin with second antibiotic in multiantibiotic drugs distributed in poland on standards and clinical bacterial strains. checkerboard results for all strains demonstrated synergism for 2.5% of combinations, only for standards strains. in one case salmonella enteritidis, in combination of neomycin with bacitracin, inhibition effect was observed. additive effects were predominant--49%. in 18% neutral effects were shown, but in 26% of combinations fic indexes were not possible to calculate, because of the resistance of clinical strains to the highest concentration of at least one antibiotic. in combination of aminoglycoside (neomycin) with beta-lactams antibiotics (ampicillin, procaine penicillin) in vitro, no synergy was observed for all examined strains. the best results were achieved for combinations of neomycin with peptide antibiotics (polymyxin, gramicidin and bacitracin)--5 for all 6 synergy effect observed.

TI  == mesophilic aerobic degradation of a metal lubricant by a biological consortium.
AB  == the metal-forming industries require the use of greases to lubricate metal surfaces during manufacturing operations, and the residues of these lubricants must be removed prior to finishing processes to protect and improve the appearance of the final product. an aqueous, biological metal-cleaning process operating under mild conditions (ph 9, 42 degrees c) eliminates the use of environmentally unfriendly cleaning materials such as chlorinated solvents by employing microorganisms to degrade greases and oils naturally. this process was  characterized in terms of initial degradation rates of a representative metal lubricant and by phylogenetic identification of the active bacteria. the metal lubricant in a surfactant solution was degraded by a bacterial consortium, and its concentration was determined by a novel gas chromatography assay. the maximum degradation rate vmax and the apparent km were obtained as 45 mg/(day mg protein) and 24 g/l on cellular basis, and 4.6 g/(day l) and 33 g/l on a volumetric basis, respectively. mineralization of the metal lubricant was shown by analyzing the evolved co2 and cl-, and the bacterial consortium utilized the metal lubricant as a sole carbon and energy source (micro=0.05+/-0.01 h(-1) at 0.5 vol% lubricant concentration). the active bacteria in the biological metal-cleaning process were identified as bacillus licheniformis for the higher lubricant concentrations (3,  5, and 7.5 vol%), bacillus cereus at 1 vol%, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, rhizobiaceae strain m100, and achromobacter sp. lmg 5431 at 0.3 vol%.

AB  == the susceptibility of several wild-type bacteria to ciprofloxacin and accumulation of the drug in these bacteria were evaluated. species studied included escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and bacillus cereus. ciprofloxacin susceptibility was measured for each strain using two different methods: the minimal inhibitory concentration and the bactericidal index. significant differences were observed between the results derived from these two methods. whereas the minimal inhibitory concentration was low in all strains tested, ciprofloxacin's bactericidal activity, as indicated by the bactericidal index, varied with the species studied. to determine whether this finding was due to variations in cell envelope permeability to ciprofloxacin (i.e. to combined cell  uptake and efflux), we studied ciprofloxacin accumulation using spectrofluorometry. in gram-negative bacteria, differences in permeability can lead to altered susceptibility to antibiotics. in fact, the combination of slow uptake and efficient efflux seems to be crucial to the characteristic poor susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin. however, the low level of activity of ciprofloxacin against s. aureus and two bacillus species may have resulted from the drug's interaction with its target enzymes (i.e. topoisomerase  iv in s. aureus and dna gyrase in bacillus spp.) rather than diminished permeability.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  == the ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. these pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. these infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer  generations of antibiotics. in this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis  and endophthalmitis. the ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis. mic90 values for the drugs  against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/ml to 0.57 mg/ml and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. the mic90 for gatifloxacin against streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/ml compared with 0.73 mg/ml for moxifloxacin (p = .011). among the gram-negative isolates, the mean mic90 for gatifloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/ml compared with 2.60 mg/ ml for moxifloxacin (p = .023).  mic90 values for gatifloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. for the atypicals, the mic90 values for gatifloxacin against nocardia asteroides and mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.

TI  == detection and characterization of the novel bacteriocin entomocin 9, and safety evaluation of its producer, bacillus thuringiensis ssp. entomocidus hd9.
AB  == aims: to identify and characterize new bacteriocins from a collection of 41 strains belonging to 27 subspecies of bacillus thuringiensis, and to evaluate the safety of the producers. methods and results: bacillus thuringiensis ssp. entomocidus hd9 produced in the culture supernatant an antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria including listeria monocytogenes, one of four pathogenic pseudomonas aeruginosa and several fungi. production of the antibacterial activity, named entomocin 9, started during mid-logarithmic growth  reaching its maximum at the early stationary phase. entomocin 9 retained more than 72% of activity after incubation for 20 min at 121 degrees c. activity was lost after proteinase k treatment, it was stable in a ph range between 3 and 9, and resistant to lyophilization. after partial purification with ammonium sulphate precipitation followed by gel-filtration and anion-exchange chromatography, an active protein of ca 12.4 kda was isolated. the mode of action of entomocin 9 was bactericidal and caused cell lysis of growing cells. despite the presence of a range of virulence related genes, including haemolysin bl, nonhaemolytic enterotoxin, cytotoxin k and several hydrolytic activities, b. thuringiensis hd9 was not toxic against vero cells. conclusions: entomocin 9 is a novel heat-stable, bacteriocin produced by b. thuringiensis hd9. the absence of toxicity against vero cells suggests the suitability of strain hd9 for a safe application in antimicrobial treatments. significance and impact of the study: new finding on entomocin 9 would make b. thuringiensis attractive in biotechnological applications as an antimicrobial agent in agriculture and food industry.

TI  == microbial and copper adsorption by smectitic clay--an experimental study.
AB  == the objective of this study was to quantify copper-, bacteria- and bacteriophage-binding capacities of natural clay with the aim of predicting the adsorption of heavy metals, human pathogenic bacteria and viruses by a clayey landfill liner. x-ray diffraction analysis of six natural clays showed that the dominant phase in all deposits consists of smectites together with illite, kaolin and, sometimes, palygorskite and sepiolite. the specific surface areas of different clay substrates were very high ranging from 293 to 351 m2 g(-1), and indicating a high proportion of phyllosilicates, consisting especially of smectites. the physico-chemical identification of separated smectites showed a high potential adsorbent character indicative of a large industrial use. the kb12 smectite substrate chosen arbitrarily among six separated substrates, appeared as an excellent copper adsorbent. copper was adsorbed to clay in a proportion ranging from 94.6 to 96.0% with an average of 95.1% and its adsorption occurred rapidly in less than 30 min. organic contents of the clay substrate, evaluated as 17% of dry mass, may contribute and enhance copper adsorption. different elution  protocols using distilled water, 2 and/or 5% nitric acid revealed that while nitric acid resulted in the removal of more than 59% of the metal at the lower concentration and its complete depletion with a further elution at the higher concentration, distilled water alone was unable to remove more than 1% of adsorbed copper. this finding suggested that copper ions form high-energy bonds with layer-silicate surfaces. interestingly, the use of a regenerated substrate as copper adsorbent subsequent to abundant washings of the used substrate consecutively, with 0.1 n hno3 and distilled water, reduced copper adsorption by  approximately 14%, suggesting a slight disturbance of clay initial structure. batch adsorption experiments with phage t7 and raw clay kb12 showed that the tested clay substrate appeared as a relatively moderate phage adsorbent since the quantity of adsorbed phage averaged 98.2 +/- 0.88% (2 log10 retention) as measured by infectivity for escherichia coli atcc 11303. as shown by two types of separating procedures, natural sedimentation and a low speed centrifugation, bacteriophage particles were bound essentially to fine and not to relatively coarse particles of the clay suspension. the retention capacity of purified clay  kb12 appeared low, with average values lower than 60 and 50%, for pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 15442 and bacillus cereus atcc 1135, respectively. a significant  increase of retention, in the order of 30%, was found for both bacteria when the  mixture clay-bacteria was incubated at laboratory temperature for 6 hours.

TI  == microbial diversity and prevalence of virulent pathogens in biofilms developed in a water reclamation system.
AB  == bacterial biofilm is a common phenomenon in both natural and engineered systems which often becomes a source of contamination and microbially influenced corrosion. it is thought that formation of biofilm in the monoculture of several  bacterial species is regulated by acylhomoserine lactone (ahl) quorum-sensing signals. in this study, we investigated the microbial diversity and existence of  ahl-producing and ahl-degrading bacterial species in the biofilm samples from a water reclamation system located in a tropical environment. 16s ribosomal dna sequencing analysis indicated the presence of at least 11 bacterial species, including the frequently encountered bacterial pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae, and several rare pathogens. we showed that only two groups of isolates, belonging to p. aeruginosa and enterobacter agglomerans, produced ahl signals. we also found that three bacterial isolates, i.e., agrobacterium tumefaciens xj01, bacillus cereus xj08, and ralstonia sp. xj12, expressed ahl degradation enzymes. furthermore, we showed that p. aeruginosa isolate hl43 was virulent against animal model caenorhabditis elegans and released 2-6-fold more pyocyanin cytotoxin than p. aeruginosa strains pa01 and pa14, the two commonly used laboratory strains. these data indicate the complexity and importance of biofilm research in water reclamation.

TI  == aerobic tryptophan degradation pathway in bacteria: novel kynurenine formamidase.
AB  == while a variety of chemical transformations related to the aerobic degradation of l-tryptophan (kynurenine pathway), and most of the genes and corresponding enzymes involved therein have been predominantly characterized in eukaryotes, relatively little was known about this pathway in bacteria. using genome comparative analysis techniques we have predicted the existence of the three-step pathway of aerobic l-tryptophan degradation to anthranilate (anthranilate pathway) in several bacteria. based on the chromosomal gene clustering analysis,  we have identified a previously unknown gene encoding for kynurenine formamidase  (ec 3.5.1.19) involved with the second step of the anthranilate pathway. this functional prediction was experimentally verified by cloning, expression and enzymatic characterization of recombinant kynurenine formamidase orthologs from bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and ralstonia metallidurans. experimental verification of the inferred anthranilate pathway was achieved by functional expression in escherichia coli of the r. metallidurans putative kynbau operon encoding three required enzymes: tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (gene kyna), kynurenine formamidase (gene kynb), and kynureninase (gene kynu). our data provide the first experimental evidence of the connection between these genes (only one of which, kynu, was previously characterized) and l-tryptophan aerobic  degradation pathway in bacteria.

TI  == diverse effects of ascorbic acid and palmitoyl ascorbate on helicobacter pylori survival and growth.
AB  == among many antioxidants used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, ascorbic acid (aa) is one of the most important. aa has been suggested to decrease the risk of gastric disease (gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and carcinoma) by direct action on helicobacter pylori. however, there are limited studies on the possible role of aa and its derivatives such as palmitoyl ascorbate (pa) on the growth and survival of h. pylori. in the present study it was demonstrated in vitro that aa in the concentration range 10-20 mg x ml(-1) (50-100 mm) inhibited  h. pylori growth in liquid medium under microaerophilic conditions. in contrast,  under aerobic conditions aa in the concentration range 2-20 mg x ml(-1) (10-100 mm) significantly increased the survival of h. pylori presumably eliminating the  toxic effect of reactive oxygen species on bacterial cells. the hydrophobic derivative of aa, pa (a food antioxidant), demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect, under both aerobic and microaerophilic conditions in the concentration range 0.04-0.4 mg x ml(-1) (0.1-1.0 mm). this effect was also tested on other bacterial strains: escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, clostridium sporogenes and campylobacter jejuni. among these bacterial strains, pa showed a similar inhibitory effect on b. cereus and b. subtilis as observed with h. pylori. the results suggest that pa may be considered an important aa derivative  in eradication of h. pylori in vitro and in vivo and to decrease the risk for gastric diseases.

TI  == thiols as classical and slow-binding inhibitors of imp-1 and other binuclear metallo-beta-lactamases.
AB  == the inhibitory effect of a variety of thiol compounds on the function of binuclear metallo-beta-lactamases, with a particular focus on imp-1 from pseudomonas aeruginosa, has been investigated. thiol inhibitors, depending on their structural features, fall into two categories, one in which inhibition at neutral ph was instantaneous and the other in which inhibition was time-dependent. while mercaptans with anionic substituents in the vicinity of their sh groups exhibited the former type of inhibition, neutral thiols appear to induce a slow, time-dependent isomerization of the initially formed ei complex to a tighter ei complex. kinetic parameters describing the latter process were obtained by fitting progress curves of substrate hydrolysis using standard and numerical procedures. the failure of charged thiols to exhibit slow binding is suggested to be due to a rapid isomerization of the initial ei complex. slow binding in the case of neutral thiols was observed only below ph 8. studies on the ph dependence of catalysis by imp-1 revealed that (i) enzyme inactivation at  low ph is a slow process with presumably two groups with a pk(a) of approximately 5.2 in the protein being responsible for the loss of activity, (ii) inhibition by thiols is independent of ph between ph 5 and 9, and (iii) an apparent enhancement of the catalytic activity of imp-1 by thiols occurs at ph <5. the last mentioned  phenomenon is explained by a model in which mercaptans retard the proton-dependent isomerization of the enzyme. studies on the thiol-mediated inhibition of the binuclear forms of bacteroides fragilis (ccra) and bacillus cereus (bcii strain 5/b/6) metallo-beta-lactamase have revealed that while ccra was instantaneously albeit moderately inhibited by mercaptans, bcii mimicked imp-1 in its interaction with thiols. these differences are proposed to be due partly to the structural divergence of these proteins in the vicinity of zn2.

TI  == eggshell matrix proteins as defense mechanism of avian eggs.
AB  == this study focused on the role of eggshell matrix proteins as a function of potential natural antimicrobial defenses of avian eggs. the electrophoretic profile of sds-page showed that the soluble eggshell matrix proteins had three major bands of 15 000, 36 000, and 66 000 and several minor bands comprising 17 000, 25 000, 30 000, and 75 000, while insoluble matrix proteins were consisting  of various bands comprising at least 16 distinct migration bands between 10 000 and 200 000. three bacteria species, pseudomonas aureginosa, bacillus cereus, and staphylococcus aureus, were found to be inhibited in the presence of soluble eggshell matrix proteins (100 microg/ml). on the other hand, escherichia coli and salmonella enteritidis were weakly inhibited at only an early stage of incubation time (up to 4 h). scanning electron microscopy revealed that eggshell matrix proteins might interact and disrupt the membrane integrity of bacteria. the present study clearly indicated that avian eggshell matrix proteins possess a potential of novel antimicrobial defensin mechanism.

TI  == application of a real-time biosensor to detect bacteria in platelet concentrates.
AB  == a spore-based biosensor for detecting low levels of bacteria in real-time has been recently developed. the system (termed lexsas, label-free exponential signal-amplification system) exploits spore's ability to produce fluorescence when sensing neighboring bacterial cells. we studied the lexsas as a possible approach for identifying bacterially contaminated platelet concentrates prior to  transfusion because the system offers rapid analysis, high sensitivity, and low cost. if successful, this approach could reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality from transfusion-related bacteremia and sepsis. in this study, we used  the lexsas for detecting bacteria in platelet concentrates spiked with bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, or streptococcus pyogenes. bacteria were separated from platelets using a 2-min procedure based on bacterial resistance to detergents and osmotic shock. the results indicate that the lexsas could be used to design a practical biosensor for identifying bacterially contaminated platelets in real-time.

TI  == a novel class of microbial phosphocholine-specific phospholipases c.
AB  == in this report we describe the 1,500-fold purification and characterization of the haemolytic phospholipase c (plc) of pseudomonas aeruginosa, the paradigm member of a novel plc/phosphatase superfamily. members include proteins from mycobacterium tuberculosis, bordetella spp., francisella tularensis and burkholderia pseudomallei. purification involved overexpression of the plchr1,2 operon, ion exchange chromatography and native preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of two proteins in the purified sample with sizes of 17,117.2 da (plcr2) and 78,417 da (plch). additionally, liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry (lcms) revealed that plch and plcr2 are at a stoichiometry of 1 : 1. western blot analysis demonstrated that the enzyme purifies as a heterodimeric complex, plchr2. plchr2 is only active on choline-containing phospholipids. it is equally  active on phosphatidylcholine (pc) and sphingomyelin (sm) and is able to hydrolyse plasmenylcholine phospholipids (plasmalogens). neither plchr2 nor the m. tuberculosis homologues are inhibited by d609 a widely used, competitive inhibitor of the bacillus cereus plc. plch, plcr2, and the plchr2 complex bind calcium. while calcium has no detectable effect on enzymatic activity, it inhibits the haemolytic activity of plchr2. in addition to being required for the secretion of plch, the chaperone plcr2 affects both the enzymatic and haemolytic  properties of plch. inclusive in these data is the conclusion that the members of this pc-plc and phosphatase family possess a novel mechanism for the recognition  and hydrolysis of their respective substrates.

TI  == simultaneous multiple substrate tag detection with esi-ion trap ms for in vivo bacterial enzyme activity profiling.
AB  == a bacterial identification method in which multiple enzyme activities are measured simultaneously and in vivo with electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (esi-ms) is described. whole-cell bacteria are immobilized onto a filter support and incubated with a mixture of substrates. each substrate is chosen to measure a specific enzyme activity of a targeted bacterium and to produce a tag of unique molecular weight. after a predetermined incubation time,  the solution is filtered, and the supernatant consisting of a mixture of released tags and unhydrolyzed substrates is directly analyzed, without chromatographic separation, by esi-ms. bacteria remain viable on the filter for further analyses. the method was tested by measuring the aminopeptidase activity of the bacteria escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the resulting aminopeptidase enzyme profiles allowed the differentiation between  the four bacteria tested. the method is rapid, since a multiplex advantage is realized when assaying for multiple enzymes, and it is amenable to automation via a flow injection analysis setup.

TI  == identification of a series of tricyclic natural products as potent broad-spectrum inhibitors of metallo-beta-lactamases.
AB  == this work describes the discovery and characterization of a novel series of tricyclic natural product-derived metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitors. natural product screening of the bacillus cereus ii enzyme identified an extract from a strain of chaetomium funicola with inhibitory activity against metallo-beta-lactamases. sb236050, sb238569, and sb236049 were successfully extracted and purified from this extract. the most active of these compounds was  sb238569, which possessed k(i) values of 79, 17, and 3.4 microm for the bacillus  cereus ii, pseudomonas aeruginosa imp-1, and bacteroides fragilis cfia metallo-beta-lactamases, respectively, yet none of the compounds exhibited any inhibitory activity against the stenotrophomonas maltophilia l-1 metallo-beta-lactamase (50% inhibitory concentration > 1,000 microm). the lack of activity against angiotensin-converting enzyme and serine beta-lactamases demonstrated the selective nature of these compounds. the crystal structure of sb236050 complexed in the active site of cfia has been obtained to a resolution of 2.5 a. sb236050 exhibits key polar interactions with lys184, asn193, and his162 and a stacking interaction with the indole ring of trp49 in the flap, which is in the closed conformation over the active site groove. sb236050 and sb238569 also demonstrate good antibacterial synergy with meropenem. eight micrograms of sb236050 per ml gave rise to an eightfold drop in the mic of meropenem for two clinical isolates of b. fragilis producing cfia, making these strains sensitive to meropenem (mic < or = 4 microg/ml). consequently, this series of metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitors exhibit the most promising antibacterial synergy activity so far observed against organisms producing metallo-beta-lactamases.

TI  == recent developments in carbapenems.
AB  == carbapenems are beta-lactam antibiotics characterised by the presence of a beta-lactam ring with a carbon instead of sulfone in the 4-position of the thyazolidinic moiety. the first carbapenem to be utilised in therapy was imipenem, the n-formimidoyl derivative of thienamycin. imipenem is coadministered with cilastatin, an inhibitor of human renal dehydropeptidase i, as imipenem is hydrolysed by this enzyme. meropenem was the first carbapenem with a 1-beta-methyl group and 2-thio pyrrolidinyl moiety, which renders this antibiotic stable to renal dehydropeptidase i. other carbapenems for parenteral administration later discovered include biapenem, panipenem, ertapenem, lenapenem, e-1010, s-4661 and bms-181139. carbapenems which are orally administered include sanfetrinem, dz-2640, cs-834 and gv-129606. carbapenems have an ultra-broad spectrum of antibacterial activity and stability to almost all clinically relevant beta-lactamases. this differentiates them from all other currently available classes of beta-lactam antibiotics. however, class b beta-lactamases, along with some rare class a and d enzymes, are able to hydrolyse these antibiotics. although class b enzymes are generally chromosomally-encoded (isolated from stenotrophomonas maltophilia, aeromonas spp., bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis, flavobacterium spp. and legionella gormanii), plasmid-metallo-beta-lactamases now are appearing in b. fragilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and members of enterobacteriaceae such as serratia marcescens and klebsiella pneumoniae. the number of these enzymes compared to the number of other beta-lactamase types is still low, however, it is likely that they will spread due to the increased selective pressure of carbapenem use. the very broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity associated with a good clinical efficacy and a favourable safety profile makes the carbapenems valuable as 'first-line' antibiotics in initial empirical therapy for the treatment of severe infections.

TI  == functional control of the binuclear metal site in the metallo-beta-lactamase-like fold by subtle amino acid replacements.
AB  == at present there are three protein families that share a common structural domain, the alphabeta/betaalpha fold of class b beta-lactamases: zinc beta-lactamases, glyoxalases ii, and a-type flavoproteins. a detailed inspection  of their superimposed structures was undertaken and showed that although these proteins contain binuclear metal sites in spatially equivalent positions, there are some subtle differences within the first ligand sphere that determine a distinct composition of metals. although zinc beta-lactamases contain either a mono or a di-zinc center, the catalytically active form of glyoxalase ii contains a mixed iron-zinc binuclear center, whereas a-type flavoproteins contain a di-iron site. these variations on the type of metal site found within a common fold are correlated with the subtle variations in the nature of the ligating amino acid residues and are discussed in terms of the different reactions catalyzed by each of the protein families. correlation of these observations with sequence data results in the definition of a sequence motif that comprises the possible binuclear metal site ligands in this broad family. the evolution of the  proteins sharing this common fold and factors modulating reactivity are also discussed.

AB  == aims: to determine the role of lactoperoxidase (lp) in inhibiting the growth of micro-organisms in pasteurised milk. methods and results: four micro-organisms of importance in the spoilage of pasteurized milk were challenged in lactoperoxidase (lp)-enriched ultra-heat treated (uht) milk after subsequent pasteurization. milk samples were stored at the optimum temperatures for growth of the individual bacteria. pasteurization was carried out at 72 degrees c/15 s and 80 degrees c/15 s to determine the effect of the lp system on the micro-organisms. an active lp system was found to greatly increase the keeping quality (kq) of milks inoculated with pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus thermophilus and pasteurized at 72 degrees c, but had little or no effect in milks heated at 80 degrees c, presumably due to virtual inactivation of lp at 80 degrees c. however, pasteurization temperature had no effect on the kq of milks challenged with bacillus cereus spores. conclusions: this study suggests that the lp system, rather than heat-shocking of spores, is responsible for the greater kq of milk pasteurized at 72 degrees c/15 s compared with 80 degrees c/15 s. significance and impact of the study: the study emphasizes the care required in selecting pasteurization temperatures in commercial practice and to avoid the temptation to compensate for inferior quality of raw milk by increasing pasteurization temperature.

TI  == antibacterial activity of traditional australian medicinal plants.
AB  == fifty-six ethanolic extracts of various parts of 39 plants used in traditional australian aboriginal medicine were investigated for their antibacterial activities against four gram-positive (bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes) and four gram-negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium) bacterial species. in a plate-hole diffusion assay, 12 extracts inhibited the growth of one or more of the bacteria, with five extracts showing broad spectrum antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria. b. cereus was the most susceptible bacterium, with all 12 extracts displaying activity against this organism. extracts from the leaves of eremophila species (myoporaceae) were the most active, with eremophila duttonii exhibiting the greatest activity (against gram-positive bacteria). the antibacterial effects of  e. duttonii were further investigated by time-course growth assays which showed that significant growth inhibition was observed in cultures incubated in the presence of the extract within 1 h for b. cereus, e. faecalis and s. aureus and 2 h for s. pyogenes.

TI  == [determination of the antibacterial and antiviral activity of the essential oil from minthostachys verticillata (griseb.) epling].
AB  == the in vitro antiviral activity of the essential oil from minthostachys verticillata was investigated against herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) and pseudorabies virus (prv). the viral inhibition was assayed employing viral plaque reduction assay. the antiviral activity of the essential oil specifically affects prv and hsv-1 multiplication, since it was found that non toxic effects on cells  were observed at the concentrations assayed. the therapeutic index values were 10.0 and 9.5 for hsv-1 and prv, respectively. the antibacterial activity was studied using a diffusion assay and the broth tube dilution method. gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to inhibition by plant essential oil than the gram-negative bacteria. the essential oil of m. verticillata was analyzed by gas  chromatography (gc) technique. of the six components identified in the volatile oil, pulegone (44.56%) and menthone (39.51%) were the major constituents. the antimicrobial activity can be explained to some extent by the presence of pulegone. results suggest that further investigations concerning the isolation of the substance responsible for the antimicrobial activity and an effort to define  the mechanisms of action are warranted.

TI  == evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

TI  == rapid detection and identification of bacterial strains by fourier transform near-infrared spectroscopy.
AB  == the use of fourier transform near-infrared (ft-nir) spectroscopy and multivariate pattern recognition techniques for the rapid detection and identification of bacterial contamination in liquids was evaluated. the complex biochemical composition of bacteria yields ft-nir vibrational transitions (overtone and combination bands) that can be used for classification and identification. bacterial suspensions (escherichia coli hb101, e. coli atcc 43888, e. coli 1224,  bacillus amyloliquifaciens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus cereus, and listeria innocua) were filtered to harvest the cells and eliminate the matrix, which has a strong nir signal. ft-nir measurements were done using a diffuse reflection-integrating sphere. principal component analysis showed tight clustering of the bacterial strains at the information-rich spectral region of 6000-4000 cm(-1). the method reproducibly distinguished between different e. coli isolates and conclusively identified the relationship between a new isolate and one of the test species. this methodology may allow for the rapid assessment of potential bacterial contamination in liquids with minimal sample preparation.

AB  == from the guts of new and old colonies (female and male) of mexican fruit flies, anastrepha ludens (diptera: tephritidae), we identified a total of 18 different bacterial species belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonadaceae, vibrionaceae, micrococcaceae, deinococcacea, bacillaceae, and the genus listeria. enterobacter, providencia, serratia, and staphylococcus spp. were the most frequently isolated genera, with citrobacter, streptococcus, aerococcus, and listeria found less frequently. we found bacillus cereus, enterobacter sakazakii, providencia stuartii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa only in the new colony, aeromonas hydrophila and klebsiella pneumoniae spp. pneumoniae only in the old colony. we also studied resistance/sensitivity to 12 antibiotics for six bacterial isolates such as enterobacter cloacae, e. sakazakii, k. pneumoniae spp., providencia rettgeri, p. aeruginosa, and bacillus cereus. isolates on the whole were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin (five of six isolates) and sensitive to rifampin and streptomycin (six of six isolates). antibiotic resistance profiles might be useful characteristics for distinguishing among species and strains of these bacteria, probably having ecological significance with respect to intra- and inter-specific competition within host cadavers, and could have implications for the utility of these organisms for biological control, including the alternative control strategy, paratransgenesis.

TI  == growth of bacteria in inoculated platelets: implications for bacteria detection and the extension of platelet storage.
AB  == background: recent reports from europe have advocated the use of bacterial culturing of platelets on day 2 or 3 of storage to extend the shelf life of platelets to 7 days, thereby reducing the outdating of platelets and preserving a limited medical resource. to assess the optimal timing, the necessary sensitivity, and the possible efficacy of bacterial detection, the bacterial growth characteristics were reviewed in 165 platelet units, each inoculated on the day of collection with one of the following organisms: bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis from four previously published studies. study design and methods: quantitative culture data from inoculated platelet concentrates from five sites and four studies were combined into one database and analyzed for bacterial concentration thresholds (> or =10(1), > or =10(2), > or =10(3), > or =10(4), > or =10(5) cfu/ml) by day of storage. results: all examples of b. cereus, p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and s. aureus had concentrations > or =10(2) cfu per ml by day 3 after inoculation. by day 4, all units with these organisms contained > or =10(5) cfu per ml. units contaminated with s. epidermidis showed slower and more varied  growth. by day 3 after inoculation, 81.3 percent had 10(2) cfu per ml. by day 4 after inoculation, 46 (95.8%) of 48 units had concentrations > or =10(2) cfu per  ml. conclusion: these experiments suggest that an assay capable of detecting 10(2) cfu per ml on day 3 of storage would detect the vast majority of bacterially contaminated platelet units, prevent many cases of platelet-associated bacterial sepsis, and provide a scientific basis for the extension of the current platelet storage time. it would be expected that a rare, slow-growing organism could escape such a detection scheme.

TI  == photochemical inactivation of bacteria and hiv in buffy-coat-derived platelet concentrates under conditions that preserve in vitro platelet function.
AB  == background and objectives: a photochemical process has been tested for the inactivation of viruses and bacteria in buffy-coat derived platelet concentrates  (bc pcs). materials and methods: bc pcs in 35% cpd plasma and 65% platelet-additive solution (pas iii) were exposed to photochemical treatment (pct) with 150 microm of the psoralen s-59 and a 3 j/cm(2) treatment with long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva, 320-400 nm). platelet function was evaluated following pct using a panel of in vitro assays. results: this pct process was highly effective at inactivating gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia  marcescens). no viable bacteria were detected following pct and 7 days of platelet storage while bacterial growth was detected in paired untreated control  bc pcs. complete inactivation of the gram-positive bacillus cereus was achieved only in one of two replicate experiments with bc pcs. pct was also highly effective for inactivation of human immunodeficiency virus hiv-1 in bc pcs inoculated with approximately 10(6) tissue culture infectious doses per milliliter (tcid(50)/ml) of cell-associated hiv-1. rapid inactivation was observed with increasing uva doses: with 150 microm s-59 and a 1 j/cm(2) treatment of uva, a reduction of 5.6+/-0.5 log tcid(50)/ml was achieved, and a reduction of >6.4 log tcid(50)/ml was achieved with 150 microm s-59 and a 3 j/cm(2) treatment of uva. no physiologically relevant differences in platelet functions were found between the test and the control bc pcs during 7 days of storage. conclusion: pct with 150 microm s-59 and a 3 j/cm(2) uva treatment does  not adversely affect in vitro properties of bc pcs stored at 22 degrees c for 7 days. the pct process inactivated bacteria and hiv-1 inoculated into the bc pcs.  these results extend the earlier reported efficacy of pct apheresis pcs to bc pcs.

AB  == kombucha was prepared in a tea broth (0.5% w/v) supplemented with sucrose (10% w/v) by using a commercially available starter culture. the ph decreased steadily from 5 to 2.5 during the fermentation while the weight of the "tea fungus" and the od of the tea broth increased through 4 days of the fermentation and remained fairly constant thereafter. the counts of acetic acid-producing bacteria and yeasts in the broth increased up to 4 days of fermentation and decreased afterward. the antimicrobial activity of kombucha was investigated against a number of pathogenic microorganisms. staphylococcus aureus, shigella sonnei, escherichia coli, aeromonas hydrophila, yersinia enterolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus epidermis, campylobacter jejuni, salmonella enteritidis, salmonella typhimurium, bacillus cereus, helicobacterpylori, and listeria monocytogenes were found to be sensitive to kombucha. according to the literature on kombucha, acetic acid is considered to be responsible for the inhibitory effect toward a number of microbes tested, and  this is also valid in the present study. however, in this study, kombucha proved  to exert antimicrobial activities against e. coli, sh. sonnei, sal. typhimurium,  sal. enteritidis, and cm. jejuni, even at neutral ph and after thermal denaturation. this finding suggests the presence of antimicrobial compounds other than acetic acid and large proteins in kombucha.

AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa col-1 was identified in a blood culture of a 39-year-old-woman treated with imipenem in marseilles, france, in 1996. this strain was resistant to beta-lactams, including ureidopenicillins, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, and meropenem, but  remained susceptible to the monobactam aztreonam. the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase gene of p. aeruginosa col-1 was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in escherichia coli dh10b. the deduced 266-amino-acid protein was an ambler class b beta-lactamase, with amino acid identities of 32% with b-ii from bacillus cereus; 31% with imp-1 from several gram-negative rods in japan, including p. aeruginosa; 27% with ccra from bacteroides fragilis; 24% with blab from chryseobacterium meningosepticum; 24% with ind-1 from chryseobacterium indologenes; 21% with cpha-1 from aeromonas hydrophila; and 11% with l-1 from stenotrophomonas maltophilia. it was most closely related to vim-1 beta-lactamase recently reported from italian p. aeruginosa clinical isolates (90% amino acid identity). purified vim-2 beta-lactamase had a pi of 5.6, a relative molecular mass of 29.7 kda, and a broad substrate hydrolysis range, including penicillins,  cephalosporins, cephamycins, oxacephamycins, and carbapenems, but not monobactams. as a metallo-beta-lactamase, its activity was zinc dependent and inhibited by edta (50% inhibitory concentration, 50 microm). vim-2 conferred a resistance pattern to beta-lactams in e. coli dh10b that paralleled its in vitro  hydrolytic properties, except for susceptibility to ureidopenicillins, carbapenems, and cefepime. bla(vim-2) was located on a ca. 45-kb plasmid that in  addition conferred resistance to sulfamides and that was not self-transmissible either from p. aeruginosa to e. coli or from e. coli to e. coli. bla(vim-2) was the only gene cassette located within the variable region of a novel class 1 integron, in56, that was weakly related to the bla(vim-1)-containing integron. vim-2 is the second carbapenem-hydrolyzing metalloenzyme characterized from a p.  aeruginosa isolate outside japan.

AB  == imp-1 beta-lactamase, a class b zinc metallo-enzyme encoded by the transferable bla(imp) gene, is known to confer high-level resistance to carbapenems as well as to penicillins and cephalosporins. j-111, 225 is a novel 1beta-methylcarbapenem with a structurally unique side chain comprising a trans-3,5-disubstituted pyrrolidinylthio moiety at the c2 position. it inhibited 17 serratia marcescens and two pseudomonas aeruginosa imp-1-producing clinical isolates at a concentration of 32 mg/l (range 4-32 mg/l). it showed synergy with imipenem against imp-1-producing s. marcescens bb5886 and p. aeruginosa gn17203 with minimal fic indices of 0.38 and 0.5, respectively. j-111,225 was more resistant than imipenem to hydrolysis by class b metallo-beta-lactamases. in kinetic studies, j-111,225 inhibited the imp-i enzyme with a k(i) of 0.18 microm when imipenem was used as a substrate. in contrast, j-111,225 was the substrate for hydrolysis by other class b beta-lactamases such as bacteroides fragilis ccra, stenotrophomonas maltophilia l1 and bacillus cereus type ii enzyme with respective k(m) values of 11, 10 and 148 microm. the greater antibacterial activity of j-111,225 against imp-1-producing bacteria may result from its unique interaction with the beta-lactamase.

AB  == purpose: the human sclera is frequently used in ophthalmic surgeries and must be  preserved in disinfectants that prevent its contamination. in this study the efficiency of glycerin, absolute alcohol (ethanol), and benzalkonium chloride (1:5,000) as human sclera disinfectants were compared. methods: fresh human scleras were trephined, the scleral disks divided into three groups and contaminated with staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853), or bacillus cereus (atcc 11778) for 24 h. thereafter they were transferred to preservation vials each containing glycerin, absolute alcohol, benzalkonium chloride diluted in 70% alcohol (1:5,000) or trypticase soy broth (control), respectively, and stored at room temperature. from each vial, two scleral disks were removed after 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, and 14 days of immersion. both were plated on blood agar, one being macerated, and both incubated at 37 degrees c for 48 h. results: pseudomonas aeruginosa, s. aureus, and b. cereus were recovered from the glycerin-immersed scleral disks until the second, fourth, and fourteenth days, respectively. bacillus cereus was recovered from those immersed in absolute alcohol until the fourteenth day, whereas disks infected with the other microorganisms and immersed in absolute alcohol presented no growth since the very first day of immersion. bacillus cereus was recovered from  scleral disks immersed in benzalkonium chloride diluted in 70% alcohol (1:5,000)  only on the first day. conclusion: resistant microorganisms can survive in scleral tissue preserved in glycerin and absolute alcohol. we conclude that benzalkonium chloride diluted in 70% alcohol (1:5,000) in vitro is the best disinfectant for human sclera after 24 h.

TI  == formation and structure of mixed bacterial communities.
AB  == mixed bacterial communities are formed by unrelated bacteria on solid media. mixed bacterial communities on solid media are similar to "classical" colonies and are formed after the growth of a large number of unrelated bacteria simultaneously plated onto a limited area of agar. the morphology of the mixed bacterial communities was similar for different combinations of bacteria and did  not change when the bacteria were plated on different media. different bacterial  strains form zones of individual and mixed growth in the structure of mixed bacterial communities. the results of electron microscopic examination indicate that mixed bacterial communities are isolated from their external environment by  a surface film. the basic part of this film is formed by an elementary membrane.  the membrane of the surface film of mixed bacterial communities is a stable structure occupying a large surface area. the results of this investigation seem  to indicate the existence of a special type of co-operation between different species of bacteria. this type of co-operation may be very important in the regulation of interactions between different bacteria and between bacteria and the environment.

TI  == cloning and characterization of blavim, a new integron-borne metallo-beta-lactamase gene from a pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate.
AB  == production of a metallo-beta-lactamase activity was detected in a carbapenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate (isolate vr-143/97)  from an italian inpatient at the verona university hospital (northern italy). the metallo-beta-lactamase determinant was isolated from a genomic library of vr-143/97, constructed in an escherichia coli plasmid vector, by screening for clones with reduced susceptibility to imipenem. sequencing of the cloned gene revealed that it encoded a new class b beta-lactamase that was named vim-1. at the sequence level vim-1 was rather divergent from the other class b enzymes (16.4 to 38.7% identity), overall being more similar to members of subclass b1 including the beta-lactamase ii of bacillus cereus (bc-ii), the bacteroides fragilis ccra, the chryseobacterium meningosepticum blab, and the cassette-encoded imp-1 enzymes. among these, vim-1 showed the highest degree of similarity to bc-ii. similarly to blaimp, blavim was also found to be carried on  a gene cassette inserted into a class 1 integron. the blavim-containing integron  was located on the chromosome of p. aeruginosa vr-143/97, and the metallo-beta-lactamase-encoding determinant was not transferable to e. coli by conjugation. expression of the integron-borne blavim gene in e. coli resulted in  a significant decrease in susceptibility to a broad array of beta-lactams (ampicillin, carbenicillin, piperacillin, mezlocillin, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, cefoperazone, cefepime, and carbapenems), revealing a very broad substrate specificity of the vim-1 enzyme.

TI  == amino-acid sequence and three-dimensional structure of the staphylococcus aureus  metalloproteinase at 1.72 a resolution.
AB  == background: aureolysin is an extracellular zinc-dependent metalloproteinase from  the pathogenic bacterium staphylococcus aureus. this enzyme exhibits in vitro activity against several molecules of biological significance for the host, indicating that it is involved in the pathology of staphylococcal diseases. results: here we report the amino-acid sequence and inhibitor-free x-ray crystal  structure of aureolysin, a member of the thermolysin family of zinc-dependent metalloproteinases. this enzyme, which binds one zinc and three calcium ions, comprises a single chain of 301 amino acids that consists of a beta-strand-rich upper domain and an alpha-helix-rich lower domain. conclusions: the overall structure of aureolysin is very similar to that of the other three members of this family whose structures are known - thermolysin (tln) from bacillus thermoproteolyticus, neutral protease (np) from bacillus cereus and elastase (pae) from pseudomonas aeruginosa. but an important difference has been encountered: in contrast to what has been observed in the other three members of  this family (tln, np and pae), inhibitor-free aureolysin displays a 'closed' active site cleft conformation. this new structure therefore raises questions about the universality of the hinge-bending motion model for the neutral metalloproteinases.

TI  == involvement of a rhamnolipid-producing strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa in the degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by a bacterial community.
AB  == a rhamnolipid-producing strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa gl1 was isolated from a  bacterial community growing on a mixture of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pah) as sole carbon source. strain gl1 did not grow on pah but grew on known degradation metabolites of phenanthrene (o-phthalic acid) and of naphthalene (salicylic acid). in co-culture with a phenanthrene-degrading strain, ps. aeruginosa gl1 accelerated the degradation of phenanthrene. strain gl1 was resistant to toxic amphiphilic compounds such as cationic and anionic detergents. rhamnolipid production took place in a late stage growth in cultures of strain gl1 on glycerol or n-hexadecane. it coincided with a substantial decrease in cell hydrophobicity and with morphological changes of the outer membrane as observed by transmission electronic microscopy. the rhamnolipids produced inhibited the growth of bacteria such as rhodococcus erythropolis, bacillus cereus and ps. fluorescens. the overall results suggested an outer membrane origin for the rhamnolipids. they also indicate that the utilization of pah metabolites by strain gl1 is important for the stability of the pah-degrading community.

TI  == insights into the mechanism of catalysis by the p-c bond-cleaving enzyme phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase derived from gene sequence analysis and mutagenesis.
AB  == phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase (phosphonatase) catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphonoacetaldehyde to acetaldehyde and inorganic phosphate. in this study, the genes encoding phosphonatase in bacillus cereus and in salmonella typhimurium were cloned for high-level expression in escherichia coli. the kinetic properties of the purified, recombinant phosphonatases were determined. the schiff base mechanism known to operate in the b. cereus enzyme was verified for the s. typhimurium enzyme by phosphonoacetaldehyde-sodium borohydride-induced inactivation and by site-directed mutagenesis of the catalytic lysine 53. the protein sequence inferred from the b. cereus phosphonatase gene was determined, and this sequence was used along with that from the s. typhimurium phosphonatase  gene sequence to search the primary sequence databases for possible structural homologues. we found that phosphonatase belongs to a novel family of hydrolases which appear to use a highly conserved active site aspartate residue in covalent  catalysis. on the basis of this finding and the known stereochemical course of phosphonatase-catalyzed hydrolysis at phosphorus (retention), we propose a mechanism which involves schiff base formation with lysine 53 followed by phosphoryl transfer to aspartate (at position 11 in the s. typhimurium enzyme and position 12 in the b. cereusphosphonatase) and last hydrolysis at the imine c(1)  and acyl phosphate phosphorus.

(asteraceae) is used  in local ethnomedicine as an anticatarrhal, a depurative and in the treatment of  skin diseases. this ethnopharmacological information has a direct correlation with that reported for other chromolaena species. dichloromethane and aqueous extracts from the leaves as well as ethyl acetate extracts from the flowers have  shown antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus and a uv-v light effect was not observed against this bacterium. these results may justify the ethnomedical use in skin infections. the flavonoids kaempferol, kaempferol-3-o-rutinoside, rutin and isoquercitrin as well as the triterpene alpha-amyrin were isolated.

TI  == [combined effect of temperature a(w) and ph on proteases from pseudomonas and bacillus spp].
AB  == the factors affecting protease activity were investigated on certain media. five  strains of bacillus (b.) cereus, four strains of b. subtilis, five strains of pseudomonas (ps.) aeruginosa and two strains of ps. fluorescens produced the proteases that were tested. the enzyme activity was evaluated under 32 different  combinations of temperature (2 and 7 degrees c), water activity (aw) (0.80-0.98)  and ph (4.0-7.3). a decrease in water activity and ph and/or temperature caused a decrease in protease activity. it appeared that the combined effect of temperature, aw and ph influences enzyme production significantly compared with the influence of single environmental factors. temperature plays the crucial role in these reactions. enzyme activities could be observed even at low temperature.  although the exoprotease of ps. spp. showed intense activity at refrigeration temperature, low ph and aw, bacillus proteases were comparably less active under  the same conditions, but nevertheless proved to be significant.

AB  == high-performance liquid chromatography coupled on-line with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (hplc-icp-ms) was used for the characterization of metal ions in several metalloproteases of bacterial origin. the different components of the bacterial extracts were separated on a size-exclusion column. the eluent of the hplc system was continuously transported to the icp-ms system for rapid, reproducible, and sensitive analyses of trace elements in the metalloproteases. two different membrane proteases from bacillus cereus and pseudomonas aeruginosa  were characterized to be zinc metalloproteases using enzymological methods and hplc-icp-ms. the zinc content was determined to be three molecules of zinc per protein molecule for the b. cereus protease and one molecule of zinc per protein  molecule for the p. aeruginosa protease. for another purified protease, a periplasmic alanyl aminopeptidase of p. aeruginosa, the lack of protein-bound metal ions could be clearly determined-a confirmation that this main aminopeptidase of p. aeruginosa belongs to the cysteine protease family. the presence of nonionic detergents can influence the distribution of trace elements  during the hplc separation. therefore, the use of these substances should be avoided during enzyme purification for metal analyses or they should be exchanged later for zwitterionic and ionic detergents with more strongly dissociating properties.

TI  == role of hemolytic and nonhemolytic phospholipase c from pseudomonas aeruginosa for inflammatory mediator release from human granulocytes.
AB  == background: pseudomonas aeruginosa phospholipase c (plc) is a critical component  in the pathogenesis of severe p. aeruginosa infections. however, p. aeruginosa can produce a hemolytic (plc-h) as well as a nonhemolytic (plc-n) variant, both having a mw of about 77 kd. in the past, studies did not distinguish between both types of plc with regard to the induction of inflammatory mediators from human cells. methods: we compared the ability of p. aeruginosa plc-h and plc-n to generate leukotriene b4 (by hplc) and oxygen (o2-) metabolites (luminol-enhanced  chemiluminescence), and to release beta-glucuronidase and histamine (fluorophotometry from human granulocytes. therefore, human neutrophilic granulocytes (pmn; 1 x 10(7)) or human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (5 x 10(6)) were treated with purified p. aeruginosa plc-h (up to 10 units) as well as culture supernatants (cutoff: mw > 50,000) of p. aeruginosa paol capable of producing both plc-h and plc-n, and paol mutant strains deficient in the production of either or both phospholipases. controls were plc-h from clostridium perfringens and plc-n from bacillus cereus. results: plc-h-containing p. aeruginosa culture supernatant, purified p. aeruginosa plc-h as well as plc-h from p. perfringens activated human leukocytes for a significant (p < 0.05) increase in inflammatory mediator release. in this regard, purified plc-h (10 units) from p. aeruginosa activated human pmn for a significant increase in the generation of oxygen metabolites (30 +/- 5.4 x 10(3) cpm) and in leukotriene b4 (6.1 +/- 2.0 ng), in the release of beta-glucuronidase (15.8 +/- 1.1%) and of histamine (25.8 +/- 6.2%) as compared to the corresponding control values (3 +/-  1 x 10(3) cpm; 0.2 +/- 0.1 ng; 5.1 +/- 1.0%, 5.1 +/- 1.5%). culture supernatants  containing no plc or only plc-n, as well as plc-n from b. cereus, failed to activate or only slightly stimulated human granulocytes for inflammatory mediator release. conclusion: the data thus provide evidence that p. aeruginosa plc-h can  be a potent inducer of inflammatory mediator release, at least in vitro. our results therefore contribute to the understanding of the pathophysiological role  of p. aeruginosa plcs.

TI  == inhibition of spoilage and food-borne pathogens by lactic acid bacteria isolated  from fermenting tef (eragrostis tef) dough.
AB  == a study was carried out at the department of biology, addis abeba university, in  1991 to determine the inhibitory potential of fermenting tef and the lactic acid  bacteria isolated from fermenting tef dough on salmonella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella spp., bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus. the test  bacteria grew in the fermenting tef uptill 30 hr or till the ph dropped to 4.7. thereafter, growth was inhibited and decreases in population were apparent. the results showed that the spent media from all of the four lactic acid bacterial isolates, namely, lactobacillus spp., pediococcus spp., leuconostoc spp. and streptococcus spp. inhibited the test bacteria. acidity on its own was not responsible for the inhibition of the test bacteria. the spent medium from streptococcus spp. showed the best inhibitory activity amongst the lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == anti-bacterial antibodies in epstein-barr virus (ebv)-transformed oligoclonal b-cell lines established from normal persons and autoimmune disease patients.
AB  == we have established 950 and 430 oligoclonal b-lymphoblastoid cell lines (lcl) from two normal persons and eight autoimmune disease patients, respectively by using epstein-barr virus (ebv)-induced transformation. to re-evaluate the ebv technique for production of human monoclonal antibodies (mab) related to infectious disease, we screened these oligoclonal lcls for antibodies against 31  bacterial strains systematically. a total of 74 cultures out of 1380 were reactive to a total of 18 strains out of 31. among these, eight cultures showed 10(-3) antibody (ab) titers to pseudomonas aeruginosa serotypes c, e, f and i, staphylococcus aureus, serratia marcescens and bacillus cereus. ten cultures showed 10(-2) ab titers to ps. aeruginosa serotypes d, e, f and i, ps. maltophilia, staph. epidermidis, klebsiella ozaenae, ser. marcescens and b. subtilis. the results reveal the further possibilities for the ebv technique to produce various infectious disease-related human mabs.

TI  == platelet bacterial contamination and the use of a chemiluminescence-linked universal bacterial ribosomal rna gene probe.
AB  == background: currently, the maximum outdate for platelets is 5 days, because of the increasing chance of bacterial growth over time. various methods for rapid detection of bacterial contamination of blood components have been described, with mixed results and no general acceptance. a recently described, molecular biologic approach for the detection of bacterial contamination involves a chemiluminescence-linked universal dna bacterial probe to a highly conserved bacterial region of ribosomal rna (rrna). study design and methods: a multicenter trial of a chemiluminescence-linked universal bacterial rrna probe for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates is described. at each of five sites, platelet concentrates (no older than 1 day from date of phlebotomy) were inoculated in triplicate with isolates of four bacterial species (pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus aureus) to a final concentration of 10 to 50 colony-forming units  (cfus) per ml and in triplicate to a final concentration of 1000 cfus per ml. at  one site, an additional 6 platelet concentrates were inoculated with sterile saline to serve as controls. inoculated units were then subjected periodically to quantitative cultures and probe analyses. a total of 126 platelet concentrates were studied over a period of 7 days (120 inoculated with bacteria and 6 with sterile saline). results: this assay was, in some cases, able to detect s. aureus bacterial contamination in the range of 100 to 1000 cfus per ml; the majority of  samples (b. cereus, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, and s. epidermidis) with contamination exceeding 10(4) cfus per ml; and all samples with contamination of  2.1 x 10(5) cfus per ml or greater. increasing the sample size from the recommended 0.4 ml to 1.0 ml resulted in an unacceptable loss of specificity (83.3%). conclusion: the routine use of this assay would be expected to result in a decreased risk of septic platelet transfusion reactions and could lead to a lengthening of the current 5 day storage period for platelets. further, the pooling of random-donor platelet concentrates before storage instead of immediately before transfusion may be possible if this rrna probe is employed to  detect bacteria in the pool.

TI  == survival and growth of selected pathogens in fermented kocho (ensete ventricosum).
AB  == a study was conducted to investigate the antagonistic potential of fermented kocho, aqueous extract of fermented kocho and spent media from lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from it on salmonella sp, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella sp, bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus. fermented kocho (ph 4.3) inhibited growth of the test bacteria soon after their introduction into the food. the spent media from all of the four lab, isolated from fermented kocho, namely pediococcus sp, leuconostoc sp, lactobacillus sp and streptococcus sp prevented the survival and growth of the test bacteria. the spent medium from streptococcus sp showed the best antagonistic effect amongst all the lab isolates. in all cases the inhibitory effects were independent of ph.

TI  == modes of inhibition of foodborne non-salmonella bacteria by selenite cystine selective broth.
AB  == various cell densities of six common foodborne non-salmonella bacteria were exposed to selenite cystine (sc) salmonella selective medium. the insensitivity of pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris to sc was confirmed. selenite cystine selective medium was effective against the sensitive bacteria up to certain cell densities, beyond which the bacteria survived. as judged from the minimum cell number required for survival in sc, staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive to sc, followed by bacillus cereus, escherichia coli and citrobacter freundii. when sensitive bacteria were grown in sc, they enriched resistant variants which exhibited no or reduced sensitivity to sc. the change in density of sensitive cells after exposure to sc suggested that bacterial sensitivity to sc depended on the efficiency of killing and growth inhibition by  sc as well as the fraction of resistant variants in the bacterial population. since salmonella samples generally contain unknown numbers and types of sensitive bacteria, it is difficult to predict the effectiveness of their selective inhibition by sc.

TI  == responses of diverse heterotrophic bacteria to elevated copper concentrations.
AB  == the influence of copper on the growth of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, vibrio parahaemolyticus, vibrio alginolyticus (three strains), and an unidentified vibrio sp. was examined in batch cultures. the effects of copper at micromolar concentrations varied from undetectable to complete growth inhibition. each strain was able to recover from  a growth lag observed after copper addition at a characteristic concentration. copper concentrations that allowed recovery ranged from 25 to 150 microm. extracellular proteins in the medium of cultures that had recovered from copper stress were compared with those from control cultures. protein profiles were analyzed for the presence of proteins similar to extracellular copper-binding proteins (cubp) previously reported in v. alginolyticus. cubp-like proteins were  found in each vibrio sp. examined. a protein of similar molecular mass was also detected in copper-stressed cultures of p. aeruginosa and not in control cultures. escherichia coli and bacillus spp. did not produce cubp-like proteins.  the data show that cubp-like proteins are not produced by all bacteria in response to copper stress and indicate that such proteins are common in marine vibrio spp.

TI  == bacterial contamination of platelets at a university hospital: increased identification due to intensified surveillance.
AB  == background: a cluster of bacterial contamination of platelets occurred at a university hospital in a one-month period. this unusual clustering allowed us to  examine the likely mechanism of contamination and clinical sequelae. methods: we  reviewed medical records of patients receiving random donor platelet transfusions to determine numbers of platelets transfused, reactions reported, and episodes of bacterial contamination. we also reviewed procedures at the collecting blood agencies and the hospital blood bank. results: four patients received bacterially contaminated platelets during june and july 1991. the rates of reported platelet  transfusion reactions increased significantly (p < 0.001) from september 1989 through july 1991 (study period); in addition, the rate of contamination of platelets during june and july 1991 was 23-fold higher than during the previous 21 months (p < 0.001). surveillance methodology changed dramatically during the study period, contributing to the recognition of the current cluster. pathogens isolated from the contaminated platelet pools were bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis, or pseudomonas aeruginosa in titers ranging from 10(6) to 10(8) colony forming units/ml. four constituent individual platelet units identified as the probable cause of the outbreak (including one postepidemic episode) were significantly older (mean age, 4.8 days) than 106 randomly selected individual platelet units (mean age, 3.7 days; p = 0.04). platelet pools were transfused an average of 2.5 hours after pooling. review of blood collection and platelet preparation practices did not identify breaks in procedure or technique that could have caused contamination. conclusions: increased awareness of platelet transfusion reactions by clinical staff and routine culturing of all platelets associated with transfusion reactions will identify contaminated platelets. identification of contaminated platelets is necessary to treat affected patients appropriately and to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for contaminated platelets (infect control hosp epidemiol 1994;15:82-87).

TI  == novel automated microbial screening of platelet concentrates.
AB  == the recovery of bacteria and the speed of detection of microbial growth in platelet concentrates (pc) were studied, comparing a novel automated blood culture system (bact/alert) with two traditional methods. full-scale experiments  were performed with a total of 33 units of pc (average content 320 x 10(9) platelets per unit) obtained from pooled buffy coats. six strains known as possible pc contaminants were tested: s. epidermidis, s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, b. cereus, e. aerogenes, and s. sanguis. using an inoculum of 50-98 bacteria/ml,  bacterial contamination was detected in all of 11 pcs on 132 sampling occasions.  with a small inoculum (0.3-9 bacteria/ml), the bacterial contamination was detected in all pcs in which abundant growth appeared, but failed to be detected  in some instances where the bacterial content was very small. all of 11 uninoculated pc controls were negative. with the automated method the time for detection of a culture-positive pc was 6-16 h, clearly shorter than with the two  manual-visual systems. the new system provides a rapid, reliable, and labour-saving method for screening of bacterial contamination in pcs. this would  increase safety particularly if the present 5-day shelf life were extended.

TI  == studies of one invasive and two noninvasive methods for detection of bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates.
AB  == recently, a new method for noninvasive detection of bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates was described [arpi et al.: vox sang 1993;65:335-336]. a co2-sensitive label is applied on the outer surface of the plastic container of the platelet concentrate. when any contaminating bacteria have increased the pco2 to a certain level the label changes color, indicating bacterial growth. we have  studied this technique and applied such sensitive labels both directly onto pcs and onto plastic bags with culture medium into which platelet contents have been  transferred. however, in both cases the sensitivity of the technique was found insufficient for practical quality control of pcs. there seem to be two problems  with this principle: (1) platelets produce co2 and (2) a considerable amount of the gas passes beside the detection label, in this way decreasing the sensitivity of detection by the label. this noninvasive technique was compared with an invasive method using automated bacterial culture, which was found sensitive and  rapid.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of neutralized extracellular culture filtrates of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a cultured indian milk product ('dahi').
AB  == neutralized extracellular culture filtrate obtained from isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbruecki ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus salivarius and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis from 'dahi' showed weak to moderate inhibition of staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, bacillus brevis, bacillus circulans, bacillus coagulans, bacillus laterosporus, bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa when tested by the diffusion agar well assay method. the effective minimum quantity of lactic culture filtrates required to obtain complete inhibition of an inoculum of 10(3)  cfu/ml of the bacteria tested was between 20 and 26% (vol/vol), as determined by  the agar incorporation method. neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of these lactic cultures added at a level of 10% in sterile, 10% reconstituted non-fat dry milk was able to either suppress or retard growth of selected bacterial cultures when incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. this study indicated  the antimicrobial activity of dahi and the potential of using neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of lactic acid bacteria in the biopreservation of  foods.

TI  == phase separation of nonionic detergents by salt addition and its application to membrane proteins.
AB  == by adding salts (sodium chloride, ammonium sulfate), it is possible to induce phase separation in membrane-protein solubilisates containing triton x-100 or nonidet p-40 at temperatures between 0 and 20 degrees c. other nonionic detergents of the brij, lubrol, and tween series can also be used for this procedure. the salt concentration required for induction of phase separation is dependent on the hydrophobicity of the detergent used. for detergents of the triton series it seems that detergents with lower hydrophilic lipophilic balance  numbers need lower salt concentrations to separate the phases than those with larger hydrophilic parts. ammonium sulfate precipitation as an initial purification step for membrane proteins should be avoided in the presence of the  nonionic detergents tested. instead of this procedure, phase separation induced by sodium chloride or ammonium sulfate can be recommended, as was proved for membrane-bound proteases of pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus cereus and for bacteriorhodopsin.

TI  == the penetration of oral ciprofloxacin into the aqueous humor, vitreous, and subretinal fluid of humans.
AB  == we examined ciprofloxacin levels in the aqueous humor, vitreous, or subretinal fluid in 40 patients undergoing cataract extraction, vitrectomy, or scleral buckling. ciprofloxacin, 750 mg, was administered orally an average of 17 1/2 and 5 1/2 hours preoperatively. we obtained mean ciprofloxacin levels of 0.53 microgram/ml in aqueous humor, 0.51 microgram/ml in vitreous, and 0.71 microgram/ml in subretinal fluid. these vitreous levels exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)90 of staphylococcus epidermidis, propionibacterium species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and haemophilus influenzae, as well as the mic70 of s. aureus and bacillus cereus. therefore, ciprofloxacin may have a role in the management and prevention of endophthalmitis.

AB  == a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with thermostable dna polymerase from thermus aquaticus is described for the specific amplification of the phospholipase c (alpha-toxin) gene of clostridium perfringens. a set of primers selected for their high specificity could detect cl. perfringens in stools with a detection limit of approximately 5 x 10(2) bacteria, after bi-amplification. a modified pcr without thermal steps was performed to rapidly amplify, with a yield of 60%, the  dna template. with this pcr method cl. perfringens alpha-toxin gene could be detected within 2 h. the pcr method detected alpha-toxin positive cl. perfringens but did not react with phospholipase c-producing bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, cl. sordellii and cl. bifermentans. the amplified pcr products were screened through ethidium bromide agarose gel electrophoresis or, in only 1 h, with the phastsystem (pharmacia). this pcr satisfies the criteria of specificity, sensitivity and rapidity required for a useful tool in epidemiology and for the diagnosis of the pathogen cl. perfringens as it may be used directly on stool samples.

TI  == a study of purified pyocyanine produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa: properties and grouping.
AB  == a study of more than one thousand strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa was performed. these were collected from different sources, i.e. humans, animals, environment and food. cumulative results revealed the existence of three different groups of pyocyanine. the biological importance of grouping this pigment is due to its activity against other bacteria in comparison with other antibiotics such as cyanomycin produced by streptomyces cyanoflavus. no such grouping or any other classification was found in the literature. stability test  and mic (minimum inhibitory concentration) measurements revealed the priority of  group (i); also isolates of animal origin were found preferable. this may be due  to the resistance of strains isolated from animals to antibiotics especially to carbenicillin and gentamycine. observations indicate differences in optical properties of the blue pigment, i.e. absorption centres in the uv region. some differences in their physical properties were also noted.

TI  == structural comparison suggests that thermolysin and related neutral proteases undergo hinge-bending motion during catalysis.
AB  == crystal structures are known for three members of the bacterial neutral protease  family: thermolysin from bacillus thermoproteolyticus (tln), the neutral protease from bacillus cereus (neu), and the elastase of pseudomonas aeruginosa (pae), both in free and ligand-bound forms. each enzyme consists of an n-terminal and c-terminal domain with the active site formed at the junction of the two domains. comparison of the different molecules reveals that the structure within each domain is well conserved, but there are substantial hinge-bending displacements (up to 16 degrees) of one domain relative to the other. these domain motions can  be correlated with the presence or absence of bound inhibitor, as was previously  observed in the specific example of pae [thayer, m.m., flaherty, k.m., & mckay, d.b. (1991) j. biol. chem. 266, 2864-2871]. the binding of inhibitor appears to be associated with a reduction of the domain hinge-bending angle by 6-14 degrees  and a closure of the "jaws" of the active site cleft by about 2 a. crystallographic refinement of the structure of thermolysin suggests that electron density seen in the active site of the enzyme in the original structure  determination probably corresponds to a bound dipeptide. thus, the crystal structure appears to correspond to an enzyme-inhibitor or enzyme-product complex, rather than the free enzyme, as has previously been assumed.

TI  == the role of the pro-sequence in the processing and secretion of the thermolysin-like neutral protease from bacillus cereus.
AB  == the bacillus cereus cnp gene coding for the thermolysin-like neutral protease (tnp) has been cloned, sequenced, and expressed in bacillus subtilis. the protease is first produced as a pre-pro-protein (m(r) = 61,000); the pro-peptide  is approximately two-thirds of the size of the mature protein. the pro-sequence has been compared with those of six other tnps, and significant homologies have been found. additionally, the tnp pro-sequences are shown to be homologous to the pro-sequence of pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase. a mutant has been constructed from cnp, in which 23 amino acids upstream from the pro-protein processing site have been deleted. this region has no homologous analogue in any of the other tnp pro-sequences. the deletion results in a delay of six to eight hours in detection of active protease in the growth medium, as well as a 75% decrease in maximum protease production. n-terminal analysis of the mutant mature protein demonstrates that the processing site is unaltered by the pro-sequence deletion.  the deletion must, therefore, modulate the kinetics of processing and/or secretion of the pro-protein.

AB  == mortality in adult tsetse, glossina morsitans morsitans, caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, bacillus sphaericus, bacillus cereus, bacillus thuringiensis h-14, b. thuringiensis 1, b. thuringiensis 5, b. thuringiensis var. insraelensis, and providentia rettgeri was determined. when bacteria were smeared on rabbit skin and tsetse allowed to feed only once on the contaminated area, mortality 8 days postingestion was significantly higher (p less than 0.01) in tsetse fed on p. aeruginosa, s. marcescens, b. thuringiensis 1, and p. rettgeri and increased when tsetse were allowed to feed for the second time on the contaminated skin. with this smear technique, however, mortalities were generally not remarkable. in artificial membrane feeding experiments using low concentrations of bacteria (-10(6)/ml of blood), the b. thuringiensis strains caused low mortality, except b. thuringiensis h-14, which caused 59% mortality. however, at this concentration, p. aeruginosa, s. marcescens, b. cereus, and p. rettgeri caused highly significant (p less than 0.01) mortality (64-96%). when higher concentrations of bacteria (10(7)/ml) were used, all the bacteria tested,  except b. sphaericus, caused high mortality ranging from 70 to 98%. thus, mortality depended on the species of bacteria, the dose ingested, and time postingestion.

TI  == molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the alpha-toxin (phospholipase c) of clostridium perfringens.
AB  == a fragment of dna containing the gene coding for the phospholipase c (alpha-toxin) of clostridium perfringens was cloned into escherichia coli. the cloned dna appeared to code only for the alpha-toxin and contained both the coding region and its associated gene promoter. the nucleotide sequence of the cloned dna was determined, and an open reading frame was identified which encoded a protein with a molecular weight of 42,528. by comparison of the gene sequence with the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein, a 28-amino-acid signal sequence was identified. the gene promoter showed considerable homology with the  e. coli sigma 55 consensus promoter sequences, and this may explain why the gene  was expressed by e. coli. the cloned gene product appeared to be virtually identical to the native protein. a 77-amino-acid stretch that was close to the n  terminus of the alpha-toxin showed considerable homology with similarly located regions of the bacillus cereus phosphatidylcholine, preferring phospholipase c and weaker homology with the phospholipase c from pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == the migration of bacteria through gels in the presence of iucd monofilament tails.
AB  == an in vitro model was developed to investigate the migration of a variety of bacteria of different characteristics through a gel system in the presence or absence of a wide range of polymer monofilament threads. the bacteria were unable to migrate through the gel from the point of inoculation in the absence of a solid substrate. migration occurred along all thread types tested, including those used as iucd marker tails and the extent of bacterial migration appeared to be determined primarily by the motility of the microorganisms. the implications of these findings in relation to the development of pelvic infections in iucd wearers is discussed.

TI  == pseudomonas aeruginosa cytotoxin: the influence of sphingomyelin on binding and cation permeability increase in mammalian erythrocytes.
AB  == a cytotoxic protein isolated from pseudomonas aeruginosa damages the plasma membranes of many mammalian cells by forming pores. we studied binding of the 125i-cytotoxin and the resulting increase of cation permeability in erythrocytes  of various mammalian species. the sensitivity of red blood cells was inversely related to the relative sphingomyelin content in their external surface. thus, erythrocytes with a sphingomyelin to phosphatidylcholine ratio below 1 (dog, rat, rabbit and man) were sensitive, whereas red blood cells with a ratio above 1 (pig, cattle and sheep) were not attacked even with 100-fold higher cytotoxin concentrations. at 37 degrees c 6.8 +/- 1.2 x 10(3) molecules of 125i-cytotoxin were bound per rabbit erythrocyte (kd = 59 nm), whereas no binding occurred to cattle cells. cleavage of sphingomyelin by sphingomyelinase c from bacillus cereus (ec 3.1.4.12) triggered a dose-dependent enhancement in binding and permeability increase, particularly in red blood cells with a high proportion of  sphingomyelin. the kds for all animal species investigated were 53-60 nm. pretreatment with mainly phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipases d from streptomyces chromofuscus and cabbage (ec 3.1.4.4) or phospholipase c from bacillus cereus (ec 3.1.4.3) did not influence the cytotoxin effect. the negative correlation between susceptibility and the proportion of sphingomyelin in plasma  membranes suggests a binding site close to sphingomyelin.

TI  == imipenem as substrate and inhibitor of beta-lactamases.
AB  == the interaction between imipenem, a carbapenem antibiotic, and two representative beta-lactamases has been studied. the first enzyme was beta-lactamase i, a class-a beta-lactamase from bacillus cereus; imipenem behaved as a slow substrate (kcat. 6.7 min-1, km 0.4 mm at 30 degrees c and at ph 7) that reacted by a branched pathway. there was transient formation of an altered species formed in a reversible reaction; this species was probably an acyl-enzyme in a slightly altered, but considerably more labile, conformation. the kinetics of the reaction were investigated by measuring both the concentration of the substrate and the activity of the enzyme, which fell and then rose again more slowly. the second enzyme was the chromosomal class-c beta-lactamase from pseudomonas aeruginosa; imipenem was a substrate with a low kcat. (0.8 min-1) and a low km (0.7 microm).  possible implications for the clinical use of imipenem are considered.

TI  == beta-lactamase inhibitors. the inhibition of serine beta-lactamases by specific boronic acids.
AB  == many beta-lactamases have active-site serine residues, and are competitively inhibited by boronic acids. hitherto, the boronic acids used have lacked any structural resemblance to the substrates of beta-lactamases. phenylacetamidomethaneboronic acid, trifluoroacetamidomethaneboronic acid and 2,6-dimethoxybenzamidomethaneboronic acid have now been synthesized. the first of these contains the side-chain moiety of penicillin g, and the last that of methicillin. the ph-dependence of binding of the first inhibitor to beta-lactamase i from bacillus cereus revealed pk values of 4.7 and 8.2 for (presumably) active-site groups in the enzyme. the kinetics of inhibition were studied by cryoenzymology and by stopped-flow spectrophotometry. these techniques provided evidence for a two-step mechanism of binding of the first two boronic acids mentioned above to beta-lactamase i, and for benzeneboronic acid to a beta-lactamase from pseudomonas aeruginosa. the slower step is probably associated with a change in enzyme conformation as well as the formation of an o-b bond between the active-site serine hydroxy group and the boronic acid.

AB  == two staphylococcus aureus strains were grown in brain-heart infusion (bhi) broth  and a meat medium with bacillus cereus, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. both s. aureus strains grew well and produced enterotoxin in the presence of s. faecalis in bhi broth; however, enterotoxin production was observable in the meat medium only when the s. aureus inoculum was greater than the s. faecalis inoculum. s. aureus fri-100 grown with b. cereus produced enterotoxin in both media only when the s. aureus inoculum was much higher than the b. cereus inoculum (10 versus 10(4) cfu), whereas s. aureus fri-196e produced enterotoxin in both media at all inoculum combinations except in the meat medium, when the inocula of the two organisms were the same. s. aureus grown with e. coli in bhi broth produced enterotoxin at all inoculum combinations except when the e. coli inoculum was greater than the s. aureus inoculum; however, in the meat medium, enterotoxin was produced only when the s.  aureus inoculum was much greater than the e. coli inoculum (10 versus 10(4) cfu), s. aureus fri-100 grown with p. aeruginosa in either medium produced enterotoxin  only when the s. aureus inoculum was much greater than the p. aeruginosa inoculum (10 versus 10(3) or 10(4) cfu). it can be concluded from these results that enterotoxin production is unlikely in mixed cultures unless the staphylococci outnumber the other contaminating organisms.

TI  == cryoenzymology of beta-lactamases.
AB  == the cryoenzymology of several different beta-lactamases has been investigated. particular attention has been paid to the experimental pitfalls of the technique. these include such factors as false bursts at the start of the reaction, instability of the enzymes during turnover, and km values so high that little of  the enzyme is present as a complex. many of the difficulties in cryoenzymology stem from the use of organic cryosolvents. a novel "salt" cryosolvent has been tested: ammonium acetate solutions can be used down to about -60 degrees c. the enzymes examined are readily soluble, and stable, in this solvent. nevertheless,  out of 17 beta-lactamase beta-lactam systems, only 4 proved suitable for detailed investigation. in two of these, the hydrolysis of nitrocefin or 7-(thienyl-2-acetamido)-3-[[2-[[4- (dimethylamino)phenyl]azo]pyridinio]-methyl]cephem-4-carboxylic acid (padac), by  beta-lactamase i from bacillus cereus, substrate was converted into product at a  slow enough rate (at -60 or -55 degrees c, respectively) for it to be possible to do successive scans during the course of the reaction. the spectra were those of  substrate and product, and no intermediate was detected. the results argue against the accumulation of intermediate acyl-enzyme. the hydrolysis of padac by  the p99 beta-lactamase from enterobacter cloacae again showed spectra characteristic of substrate and product, and there was, moreover, a break in the  arrhenius plot; it is possible that a conformational change is (at least partially) rate-determining. the hydrolysis of dinitrophenylpenicillin by the p99 beta-lactamase did show features suggesting the accumulation of acyl-enzyme.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the in-vitro qualities of ceftazidime, as compared to other beta-lactams and three other antimicrobials (amikacin, gentamicin and chloramphenicol), were evaluated in a multilaboratory, multiphasic study in the united states. a total of 12,986 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference dilution methods in six medical centres over 45-60 days. ceftazidime was superior to the comparison cephalosporin (cefamandole) and comparable in spectrum and activity to gentamicin against enterobacteriaceae. of 8038 enteric bacilli tested, over 98% had ctaz mics < or = 8 mg/l with a mode of < or = 0.12 mg/l. only citrobacter freundii and enterobacter aerogenes had ceftazidime mic(90s) in the resistant range ( > or =32 mg/l). staphylococcus aureus strains were less susceptible to ceftazidime (mode mic 8 mg/l) compared to cefamandole or gentamicin. ceftazidime was more effective than cefamandole or gentamicin against the beta-haemolytic streptococci and the pneumococcus. more than 90% of pseudomonas aeruginosa, most other pseudomonas spp. and acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by ceftazidime at concentrations of 8  mg/l. in other comparative studies ceftazidime was found remarkably similar in spectrum to cefotaxime, cefoperazone and moxalactam against the enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci and streptococcus spp. enterobacter cloacae was the only enteric species having ceftazidime mic90 >8 mg/l. only cefsulodin (mode  mic 2 mg/l) and cefoperazone (mode mic 4 mg/l) shared the ceftazidime activity against ps. aeruginosa. ceftazidime mic(50s) for neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producers) were 0.03-0.06 and 0.015 mg/l, respectively. ceftazidime was found to be bactericidal against most strains at or one doubling dilution above the mic, and was relatively unaffected  by increasing inoculum concentration (some strain variations). it perfused readily into bacterial cells and was effective against the majority of strains resistant to currently available cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. beta-lactamases of types i-v and bacillus cereus failed to significantly hydrolyse ceftazidime. ceftazidime inhibited only type i ent. cloacae beta-lactamase hydrolysis. disc diffusion tests favour the use of a 30 microg ceftazidime disc for the methods described by the national committee clinical laboratory standards (nccls). quality control data are presented. tentative 30 microg disc interpretive criteria, based on susceptible mics of < or =8 mg/l(> 17 mm) and resistant > or =32 mg/l ( < or =13 mm), resulted in < 1% (false resistance or false susceptible) interpretive error rates. staph. aureus was the  species most commonly found to have strains with indeterminate ceftazidime zones  or mics. we found ceftazidime to possess one of the widest clinically usable antimicrobial spectrum by in-vitro testing of any beta-lactam tested and to be most comparable to broad-spectrum aminoglycosides such as amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of street heroin.
AB  == street heroin and injection paraphernalia have been implicated as sources of bacteria causing infections in drug abusers [1]. staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacillus cereus are common etiologic agents. in a previous study of the microbiology of street heroin and injection paraphernalia,  bacillus species was the predominant isolate [2]. we did not find s. aureus, but  one study reported isolates of identical phage type from heroin powder and from an infected patient [3]. to reconcile the results of our recent investigation among drug abusers with panophthalmitis, we theorized that the drug mixture might have an antibacterial effect. of the samples of street heroin tested, all except  one were bactericidal against s. aureus. the single sample with no heroin content was not bactericidal against one isolate of s. aureus and was the only sample that exhibited some degree of inhibitory and bactericidal activity against p. aeruginosa. all samples were bactericidal against the two isolates of b. cereus tested. quinine exhibited bactericidal activity against s. aureus and b. cereus but was ineffective against p. aeruginosa. our findings indicate that most samples of street heroin have antibacterial effects against s. aureus and b. cereus but no activity against p. aeruginosa. such activity may be due to the quinine content of the mixture. the apparent lack of recovery of s. aureus from street heroin may be partially explained by this phenomenon.

AB  == a total of 69 dyes were incorporated separately at different concentrations into  an agar medium for evaluation of their effects on the quantitative recovery of five serotypes of yersinia enterocolitica. one strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa and one strain of bacillus cereus were included for comparative purposes. certain dyes were evaluated further for their selective properties with five additional serotypes of y. enterocolitica, three strains of p. aeruginosa, and two of engerobacter spp. metanil yellow was the only dye which was tolerated bettr by y. enterocolitica than by p. aeruginosa. dye sensitivity was variable amond strains  of the same serotype of y. enterocolitica. in general, y. enterocolitica showed a tolerance to dyes greater than that of gram-positive bacteria and similar to that of other gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == toxicity of zinc to fungi, bacteria, and coliphages: influence of chloride ions.
AB  == a 10 mm concentration of zn2+ decreased the survival of escherichia coli; enhanced the survival of bacillus cereus; did not significantly affect the survival of pseudomonas aeruginosa, norcardia corallina, and t1, t7, p1, and phi80 coliphages; completely inhibited mycelial growth of rhizoctonia solani; and reduced mycelial growth of fusarium solani, cunninghamella echinulata, aspergillus niger, and trichoderma viride. the toxicity of zinc to the fungi, bacteria, and coliphages was unaffected, lessened, or increased by the addition of high concentrations of nacl. the increased toxicity of zinc in the presence of high concentrations of nacl was not a result of a synergistic interaction between zn2+ and elevated osmotic pressures but of the formation of complex anionic zncl  species that exerted greater toxicities than did cationic zn2+. conversely, the decrease in zinc toxicity with increasing concentrations of nacl probably reflected the decrease in the levels of zn2+ due to the formation of zn-cl species, which was less inhibitory to these microbes than was zn2+. a. niger tolerated higher concentrations of zinc in the presence of nacl at 37 than at 25  degrees c.

TI  == [microbial resistance to formaldehyde. i. comparative quantitative studies in some selected species of vegetative bacteria, bacterial spores, fungi, bacteriophages and viruses].
AB  == the resistence of different microorganisms to formaldehyde was determined. as test objects served gram-negative and gram-positive vegetative germs (klebsiella  pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella paratyphi-b, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis), bacterial spores (bacillus cereus, bacillus pumilus, bacillus stearothermophilus, bacillus subtilis), fungi (aspergillus niger, candida albicans), bacteriophages (escherichia coli phages, t1, t2, t3), and viruses (adenovirus, poliomyelitis virus, vaccinia virus). for the studies, suspensions of germs were exposed at identical temperature (20 degrees c) and ph  (7.0). the microbicidal effect of formaldehyde was measured by the decrease of the proportion of germs capable of multiplication in the suspension (lg (n/n0); where: n0 equals initial number of germs capable of multiplication; n equals number of germs capable of multiplication after exposure to formaldehyde). for all germs the dependence of the microbicidal effect on the concentration of formaldehyde was determined. in all experiments, the duration of exposure was two hours. pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and salmonella paratyphi-b  were found to be more susceptible than staphylococcus aureus (vf. fig. 1 a). the  strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa used were widely varying as to their susceptibility. to obtain equal microbicidal effects, concentrations of formaldehyde almost three times as high had to be used for the most resistant strain than were necessary for the most susceptible strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa. all strains of klebsiella pneumoniae examined were found to have an identical resistence to formaldehyde. streptococcus faecalis was even more resistant to formaldehyde than staphylococcus aureus. in the case of streptococcus faecalis, a concentration of formaldehyde about three times as high had to be used to obtain microbicidal effects of identical magnitude. for the killing of candida albicans cells concentrations of formaldehyde not higher than  those needed for the killing of vegetative gram-negative bacteria were necessary. the conidia of aspergillus niger were found to be more resistant than the cells of candida albicans but did not require any higher concentrations than for the killing of staphylococcus aureus (see fig. 1 b). in the case of bacterial spores, a special phenomenon was observed. if the spores had been exposed to a temperature of 80 and 95 degrees c, respectively (depending on the species involved) for one or two hours following exposure to formaldehyde, a considerably higher number of spores was found to be capable of germination and colony formation than without such treatment (heat activation: cf. fig. 2a and fig. 2b). the spores of bacillus cereus had only a relatively low resistance to formaldehyde. to reduce the proportion of the spores capable of colony formation  to 1/10000, a 2.9% formaldehyde concentration was necessary without heat activation and one of 10.8% with heat activation...

TI  == [possible relationship between bacterial surface structures, immune-adherence, chemotaxis and phagocytosis (author's transl)].
AB  == in the present study we attempted to determine the relationship between bacterial surface structures, immune adherence, chemotaxis and phagocytosis. as shown in table 1 encapsulated bacteria (klebsiella ozanae, k. pneumoniae, pasteurella multocida, streptococcus pneumoniae), mycoplasma pneumoniae and m. fermentans had a much lower immune adherence-activity than non-encapsulated bacteria (bacillus cereus, brucella abortus, erysipelothrix insidiosa, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, s. typhi). consequently, the former bacteria, in the absece of specific antibodies, activated complement via the c-3-bypass to a smaller extent than the latter. in modified boyden chambers the encapsulated bacteria and the mycoplasmas were much  less cytotaxigenic than the non-encapsulated bacteria (table 3). corresponding to this was the chemotactic response in vivo. finally the rates of phagocytosis were considerably lower with the encapsulated bacteria than with the non-encapsulated  ones (fig. 1).

TI  == comparison of methods for extraction of bacterial adenine nucleotides determined  by firefly assay.
AB  == adenine nucleotides in escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, klebsiella pneumoniae,  staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were extracted using 10 different methods. extracts were assayed for adenosine 5'-triphosphate (atp), adenosine 5'-diphosphate (adp), and adenosine 5'-monophosphate (amp) by the firefly method using an improved procedure. analytical interference by bacterial  enzymes not inactivated during the extraction was found to be a major problem. however, these enzymes were inactivated to a considerable extent by the inclusion of ethylenediaminetetraacetate in the extraction reagent. the 10 extraction methods were compared with respect to yield of adenine nucleotides, interference  with the enzymic assay, reproducibility of the method, and stability of the extracts. results indicated that extraction with trichloroacetic acid was the method most closely reflecting actual levels of atp, adp and amp in intact bacterial cells. however, for the extraction of atp in some bacterial strains several other methods may be used and may be advantageous from a practical point  of view.

TI  == [occurrence and function of a proteinase inhibitor in the hemolymph of insects].
AB  == the presence of proteinase inhibitor has been proved in the hemolymph of a number of insect species from seven different insect orders. the amount of proteinase inhibitor in the hemolymph significantly increases after injection of inactivated bacteria into the hemocoelom of galleria mellonella-larvae. moreover the larvae show an increased resistance against normally lethal concentrations of trypsin, chymotrypsin, pronase p and extracellular proteinase produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa. it is discussed that the proteinase inhibitor is one of the factors acting in the antibacterial defense system in the hemolymph of galleria mellonella-larvae.

TI  == determination of bacterial cell concentrations by electrical measurements.
AB  == an instrument was developed to measure the concentration of bacterial suspensions by their electrical characteristics. it employed a square-wave signal generator,  a tetra-polar electrode probe, and a voltage detector in the form of an oscilloscope. when electrical measurements were made on washed bacteria obtained  from cultures or urine specimens, there was a direct relationship between the concentration of the cells and the electrical characteristics of the system as reflected by voltage changes. as little as 10(3) organisms per ml could be detected. the resolution between readings taken on samples containing 10(3) to 10(9) cells per ml was found to be a function of the input frequency. the maximal resolution between concentration readings was obtained at a input frequency of 10 hz. thus, with relatively simple instrumentation, bacterial concentrations could  be determined within a few minutes. this technique, therefore, eliminates the more lengthy laboratory procedures as plate counts or the accumulation of measurable metabolic changes (such as the utilization of radioactive or other substrates). this method can efficiently monitor clinical urine specimens when a  bacteriuria is suspected.

TI  == novel method for detection of beta-lactamases by using a chromogenic cephalosporin substrate.
AB  == a new cephalosporin with a highly reactive beta-lactam ring was found to give an  immediate color change in the presence of beta-lactamases from many bacteria, including staphylococci, bacillus species, enterobacteriaceae, and pseudomonas. the reaction is confined to organisms producing beta-lactamases, but it is sufficiently sensitive to indicate the presence of this enzyme is small amounts in strains previously considered not to produce it. the compound has an unusual ultraviolet spectrum, and the color change can be followed quantitatively by measuring changes in absorption which occur in the 380- to 500-nm region, where cephalosporins normally have no absorption. the development of color is thought to be a consequence of the beta-lactam ring being unusually highly conjugated with the 3-substituent. although in the bacteria only beta-lactamases produce this color change, it was found that serum and tissues from experimental animals  also rapidly produced the colored breakdown product, which was then excreted in the urine. the mechanism of the mammalian breakdown was considered to be different from that found in bacteria.
