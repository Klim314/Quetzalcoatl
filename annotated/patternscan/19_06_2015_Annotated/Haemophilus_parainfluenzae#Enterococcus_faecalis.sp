TI  == nxl-103, a combination of flopristin and linopristin, for the potential treatment of bacterial infections including community-acquired pneumonia and mrsa.
AB  == novexel is developing the novel, orally active, semisynthetic streptogramin nxl-103, which has potential therapeutic application in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, community- or hospital-acquired mrsa, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and acute bacterial skin and soft tissue infections. nxl-103 is a combination of streptogramin a:streptogramin b components, initially developed in a 70:30 dose ratio. in multiple in vitro studies, nxl-103 demonstrated potent activity against different types of bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis,  haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae. nxl-103 was not affected by the resistance profiles of bacteria against other commonly used antibiotics. in phase i clinical trials, nxl-103 achieved bactericidal levels in plasma and was generally well tolerated, with side effects primarily on the gastrointestinal system. the first phase ii trial conducted to evaluate the efficacy of nxl-103 against community-acquired pneumonia revealed that the compound was comparable with amoxicillin. nxl-103 has promise to become an important agent in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and complex skin and soft tissue infections, pending further development.

TI  == comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent north american clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29  species isolated in the us and canada between 1997 and 1999. based upon minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. against enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general,  displayed weak activity with only proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of gram-negative non-enterobacteriaceae including haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against burkholderia cepacia, pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.

TI  == etiology of acute otitis media in childhood and evaluation of two different protocols of antibiotic therapy: 10 days cefaclor vs. 3 days azitromycin.
AB  == background: acute otitis media (aom) is a common childhood infection that is frequently treated by antibiotics. there are no prospective and comprehensive trials evaluating childhood aom for etiologic pathogens and resistance pattern in turkey. the aims of the study were to determine the bacterial etiologies and resistance patterns, and identify the efficacy and the relapse rates of 3 days of azitromycin and 10 days of cefaclor therapy in aom. methods: this prospective, randomized, single-blind, open study was carried out in 78 cases of aom. mean age was 30.7+/-27 months. tympanocentesis and aspiration of middle ear fluid (mef) were used to obtain purulent material from the middle ear. group 1 consisted of the cases (n=41) on azitromycin therapy and group 2 (n=37) on cefaclor. dosage of azitromycin was 10 mg/kg per day for 3 days and cefaclor 40 mg/kg per day for 10  days. the patients were evaluated on days 3-5 (second visit), day 10 (third visit), and day 30 (fourth visit) during follow-up. results: a total of 50 species were isolated from 44 of 78 cases from which materials were obtained (44/78; 56.4%). most frequently isolated microorganism was streptococcus pneumoniae (n=18; 36%), followed by haemophilus influenzae (n=11; 22%), s. aureus (n=9; 18%), moraxella catarrhalis (n=4; 8%), and group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus (gas, n=4; 8%). enterococcus faecalis was isolated from three cases and h. parainfluenzae from one. penicillin and amoxicillin resistances of bacteria were found to be 40 and 36%, respectively. the frequency of penicillin and amoxicillin resistance in </=24-month age group was 59 and 66.6%, respectively. the patients did not demonstrate significant differences in terms of cure rate on the third to fifth day (group 1: 32.5%; group 2: 36.4%), 10th day (group 1: 76.9%; group 2: 84.8%), and on 30th day (group 1: 91.3%; group 2: 81.8%). there were no significant differences with respect to side effects, relapse, and re-infection rate between the two groups. conclusion: in more than half of the aom cases, bacteria were isolated from mef and most frequently isolated organisms were s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, and s. aureus. three-day azitromycin therapy was as effective as 10-day cefaclor therapy.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == [infective endocarditis--a review of 21 cases in last 10 years].
AB  == twenty one cases of infective endocarditis in last 10 years were re-evaluated by  duke's criteria. fourteen strains of streptococcus viridans, 4 of enterococcus faecalis, 1 of haemophilus parainfluenzae were isolated from blood culture. as to the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 8 strains of streptococci, imipenem revealed the lowest mic value, following penicillin g, ceftriaxon not equal to ampicillin, vancomycin and gentamicin. one strain of them was penicillin-resistant (0.8 micrograms/ml). serum inhibitory test (sit) and serum bactericidal test (sbt) were undergone for 6 cases. the assay was efficient to determine penicillin-tolerance of causative bacterium. vegetations were observed  in 18 cases of 21 by the echo-cardiography, especially transesophageal echocardiography had better diagnostic sensitivity compared to transthoracic echocardiography. however, it took 12 weeks from the first febrile episode to achieve definite diagnosis. one of reasons to take such a long time to reach diagnosis was that major causative organism was s. sanguis, whose inflammatory reaction to the host was said to be strikingly weak.

TI  == [clinical studies of s-1108 granules in the pediatric field].
AB  == we studied the clinical use of s-1108 granules in the pediatric field. the results are summarized as follows. 1. s-1108 was administered orally at doses ranging 6.85 and 17.6 mg/kg/day t.i.d. to 9 patients, including 5 cases of pharyngitis and 1 case each of lacunar tonsillitis, bronchitis, pneumonia and urinary tract infection. clinical efficacies were excellent in 4 cases and good in 5 cases, hence an efficacy rate of 100% was obtained. 2. haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae (2 strains each) and streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis (1 strain each) were identified in these cases. seven of the 8 strains were eliminated upon treatment and the other strain was decreased, hence an eradication rate of 87.5% was obtained. 3. side effects observed were 1 case each of soft stools and diarrhea. as an abnormal laboratory test result, an increase in gpt level was observed. 4. no refusal of the drug occurred. 5. from the above  results, we consider that this drug would be a useful new oral antibiotic for the pediatric field.

TI  == introduction of transposon tn916 dna into haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus  parainfluenzae.
AB  == enterococcus (streptococcus) faecalis transposon tn916 was introduced into haemophilus influenzae rd and haemophilus parainfluenzae by transformation and demonstrated to transpose efficiently. haemophilus transformants resistant to tetracycline were observed at a frequency of approximately 3 x 10(2) to 5 x 10(3)/micrograms of either pam120 (pgl101::tn916) or pam180 (pam81::tn916) plasmid dnas, which are incapable of autonomous replication in this host. restriction enzyme analysis and southern blot hybridization revealed that (i) tn916 integrates into many different sites in the h. influenzae and h. parainfluenzae genomes; (ii) only the 16.4-kilobase-pair tn916 dna integrates, and no vector dna was detected; and (iii) the tetr phenotype was stable in the absence of selective pressure. second-generation tn916 transformants occurred at  the high frequency of chromosomal markers and retained their original chromosomal locations. similar results were obtained with h. influenzae rd bc200 rec-1 as the recipient strain, which suggests host rec functions are not required in tn916 integrative transposition. transposition with tn916 is an important procedure for mutagenesis of haemophilus species.

TI  == [gentamicin-susceptibility of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials].
AB  == we studied on the antibacterial activity of gentamicin against various pathogens  isolated from clinical materials mainly isolated during 1974 and 1975, comparing  with other antibiotics. beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci  are less susceptible to gentamicin than staphylococci. staph, aureus and staph. epidermidis resistant to various antibiotics are very susceptible to gentamicin,  and no resistant strain to this drug was found. haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and h. parahaemolyticus are very susceptible to gentamicin, and there is no resistant strain to this drug. escherichia coli, klebsiella, citrobacter, serratia and five species of proteus are more susceptible to gentamicin and tobramycin than dibekacin and amikacin. a few resistant or less susceptible strains to gentamicin are found in e. coli, citrobacerr, serratia, pr. morganii and pr. rettgeri. pr. inconstans is less susceptible to gentamicin than other species of proteus. antibacterial activity of gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa is very strong, but dibekacin and tobramycin are stronger. gentamicin-resistant strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa are now rather few.
