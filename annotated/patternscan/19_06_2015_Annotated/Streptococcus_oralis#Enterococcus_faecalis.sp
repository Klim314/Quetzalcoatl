TI  == isolation of alkaline-tolerant bacteria from primary infected root canals.
AB  == introduction: alkaline-tolerant bacteria in primary infected root canals could have enhanced survival capacity against antimicrobials commonly used in root canal treatment. the aims of this study were to isolate and characterize alkaline-tolerant bacteria before endodontic treatment (s1), after chemomechanical root canal preparation (s2), and after calcium hydroxide dressing (s3). methods: bacteriologic samples were obtained from 43 primary infected root  canals. samples were inoculated into culture media at a ph of 9 and incubated anaerobically. the identities of bacterial isolates were determined by 16s ribosomal rna sequencing. results: all s1 samples were culture positive, with 70% harboring bacteria tolerating a ph of 9. gram-positive bacteria pseudoramibacter  alactolyticus and streptococcus spp were the most frequently isolated strains with a prevalence of 54%. of 13 culture-positive s2 samples, 8 isolates tolerated a ph of 9, namely streptococcus sanguinis, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cancerogenus, streptococcus oralis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. seven of these 8 isolates (88%) were correspondingly isolated at s1. all 3 culture-positive s3 samples tolerated a ph of 9, namely s. sanguinis and e. faecalis, which were also isolated in the corresponding s1 and s2 samples. conclusions: we showed that the  presence of alkaline-tolerant streptococcus and enterococcus spp in primary infected root canals could lead to their persistence during and after root canal  treatment and could pose a challenge to current treatment efficacy.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of different filling pastes for deciduous tooth treatment.
AB  == guedes-pinto paste is the filling material most employed in brazil for endodontic treatment of deciduous teeth; however, the rifocort(r) ointment has been removed. thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial potential of filling pastes, by proposing three new pharmacological associations to replace rifocort(r) ointment with drugs of already established antimicrobial power: nebacetin(r) ointment, 2% chlorhexidine gluconate gel, and maxitrol(r) ointment.  a paste composed of iodoform, rifocort(r) ointment and camphorated paramonochlorophenol (cpc) was employed as the gold standard (g1). the other associations were: iodoform, nebacetin(r) ointment and cpc (g2); iodoform, 2% chlorhexidine digluconate gel and cpc (g3); iodoform, maxitrol(r) ointment and cpc (g4). the associations were tested for staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), streptococcus oralis (s. oralis), enterococcus  faecalis (e. faecalis), escherichia coli (e. coli), and bacillus subtilis (b. subtilis), using the methods of dilution on solid medium - orifice agar - and broth dilution. the results were tested using statistical analysis anova and kruskal-wallis. they showed that all the pastes had a bacteriostatic effect on all the microorganisms, without any statistically significant difference, compared with g1. s. aureus was statistically significant (multiple comparison test of tukey), insofar as g2 and g3 presented the worst and the best performance, respectively. all associations were bactericidal for e. coli, s. aureus, s. mutans and s. oralis. only g3 and g4 were bactericidal for e. faecalis, whereas no product was bactericidal for b. subtilis. thus, the tested pastes have antimicrobial potential and have proved acceptable for endodontic treatment of primary teeth.

TI  == antibiofilm efficacy of photosensitizer-functionalized bioactive nanoparticles on multispecies biofilm.
AB  == introduction: newer disinfection strategies based on antibacterial nanoparticles  and photodynamic therapy (pdt) aim to eliminate residual biofilm bacteria during  root canal treatment. the aim of the current study was to test the newly developed rose bengal-functionalized chitosan nanoparticles (csrbnps) for their interaction/uptake with monospecies bacteria/biofilm and assess their antibiofilm efficacy on a multispecies biofilm model in vitro. methods: the interaction of csrbnps with bacterial cells was conducted using atomic force microscopy. their membrane-damaging effect was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm (od260nm) using enterococcus faecalis. the penetration of csrbnps into e. faecalis biofilms was evaluated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm).  multispecies biofilms of streptococcus oralis, prevotella intermedia, and actinomyces naeslundii were grown on dentin sections for 21 days to assess the antibiofilm efficacy. the biofilms were subjected to pdt (60 j/cm(2)) using csrbnps and rose bengal. the treated/untreated biofilms were examined under scanning electron microscopy and clsm. results: the csrbnps synthesized were 60 +/- 20 nm and showed absorption spectra similar to rose bengal. atomic force microscopy showed adherence of csrbnps to bacteria, roughening of cell surface, and cell disruption after pdt. csrbnp treatment resulted in significantly increased bacterial membrane damage (p < .05). csrbnps exhibited deeper penetration into the biofilm structure. scanning electron microscopy and clsm confirmed the complete disruption of multispecies biofilm with a reduction in viable bacteria and biofilm thickness (p < .05). conclusions: these novel photosensitizer functionalized bioactive nanoparticles with increased affinity to bacterial cell membrane, higher penetration into biofilm structure, and enhanced  ability to eliminate clinically relevant multispecies bacterial biofilm present a potential antibiofilm agent for root canal disinfection.

TI  == plasma components and platelet activation are essential for the antimicrobial properties of autologous platelet-rich plasma: an in vitro study.
AB  == autologous platelet concentrates are successfully adopted in a variety of medical fields to stimulate bone and soft tissue regeneration. the rationale for their use consists in the delivery of a wide range of platelet-derived bioactive molecules that promotes wound healing. in addition, antimicrobial properties of platelet concentrates have been pointed out. in this study, the effect of the platelet concentration, of the activation step and of the presence of plasmatic components on the antimicrobial activity of pure platelet-rich plasma was investigated against gram positive bacteria isolated from oral cavity. the antibacterial activity, evaluated as the minimum inhibitory concentration, was determined through the microdilution two-fold serial method. results seem to suggest that the antimicrobial activity of platelet-rich plasma against enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus oralis and staphylococcus aureus is sustained by a co-operation between plasma components and platelet-derived factors and that the activation of coagulation is a fundamental step. the findings of this study may have practical implications in the modality of application of platelet concentrates.

TI  == using color histograms and spa-lda to classify bacteria.
AB  == in this work, a new approach is proposed to verify the differentiating characteristics of five bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus oralis, and staphylococcus aureus) by using digital images obtained with a simple webcam and variable selection by the  successive projections algorithm associated with linear discriminant analysis (spa-lda). in this sense, color histograms in the red-green-blue (rgb), hue-saturation-value (hsv), and grayscale channels and their combinations were used as input data, and statistically evaluated by using different multivariate classifiers (soft independent modeling by class analogy (simca), principal component analysis-linear discriminant analysis (pca-lda), partial least squares  discriminant analysis (pls-da) and successive projections algorithm-linear discriminant analysis (spa-lda)). the bacteria strains were cultivated in a nutritive blood agar base layer for 24 h by following the brazilian pharmacopoeia, maintaining the status of cell growth and the nature of nutrient solutions under the same conditions. the best result in classification was obtained by using rgb and spa-lda, which reached 94 and 100 % of classification accuracy in the training and test sets, respectively. this result is extremely positive from the viewpoint of routine clinical analyses, because it avoids bacterial identification based on phenotypic identification of the causative organism using gram staining, culture, and biochemical proofs. therefore, the proposed method presents inherent advantages, promoting a simpler, faster, and low-cost alternative for bacterial identification.

TI  == rapid detection of gram-positive organisms by use of the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the bact/alert pediatric fan system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  == assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. we evaluated the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp) in two pediatric hospitals. positive bact/alert pediatric fan blood cultures with gram-positive organisms were tested using the bc-gp in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. to test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles  were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 cfu  per milliliter. a total of 249 gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%,  respectively. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis  with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. the  bc-gp correctly identified 14/15 cases of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus  faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae. it misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with streptococcus anginosus group as s. pneumoniae. the bc-gp detected a case of streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus agalactiae. bc-gp's rapid accurate detection of staphylococcus spp., e. faecium, and e. faecalis and its ability to  ascertain meca, vana, and vanb status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining  to optimal antibiotic use. false-positive s. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the bc-gp.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of pure platelet-rich plasma against microorganisms isolated from oral cavity.
AB  == background: autologous platelet concentrates (pcs) have been extensively used in  a variety of medical fields to promote soft and hard tissue regeneration. the significance behind their use lies in the abundance of growth factors in platelets alpha-granules that promotes wound healing. in addition, antibacterial  properties of pcs against various bacteria have been recently pointed out. in this study, the antimicrobial effect of pure platelet-rich plasma (p-prp) was evaluated against oral cavity microorganisms such as enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus oralis and pseudomonas  aeruginosa. blood samples were obtained from 17 patients who underwent oral surgery procedures involving the use of p-prp. the antibacterial activity of p-prp, evaluated as the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), was determined through the microdilution twofold serial method. results: p-prp inhibited the growth of enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus oralis, but not of pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. conclusions: p-prp is a potentially useful substance in the fight against postoperative infections. this might represent a valuable property in adjunct to the enhancement of tissue regeneration.

TI  == antibacterial activity of dentine and pulp extracellular matrix extracts.
AB  == aim: to determine whether extracellular matrix (ecm) preparations from pulp (pecm) and dentine (decm) possess antimicrobial activity. methodology: dentine and pulp ecm preparations were isolated with 10% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid  (edta), ph 7.2 and sequential use of 0.5mol l(-1) nacl, ph 11.7 and 0.1mol l(-1)  tartaric acid, ph 2.0, respectively, with protease inhibitor inclusion throughout. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis and enterococcus faecalis was assessed using turbidity as a measure of bacteria growth. the cytotoxicity of the extracts on primary pulp cells was also  determined by lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) release. statistical analysis of data was performed using paired student's t-tests. results: extracellular matrix extracts from the pulp and dentine showed antibacterial activity against three types of anaerobic bacteria associated with dental disease (p< 0.05). the ecm extracts demonstrated no significant cytotoxic effect on pulpal cells at the concentrations used for antibacterial activity. conclusions: the bacteriostatic antibacterial activity of pecm and decm indicates that the release of these matrix molecules from pulp and dentine may contribute to defence responses during dental disease, treatment and repair.

TI  == evaluation of the incidence of endophthalmitis after intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor.
AB  == aims: to report the incidence of infectious and noninfectious endophthalmitis after intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) from a multicenter clinical trial in japan. methods: a retrospective multicenter  review of the data of patients who received intravitreal anti-vegf injections between january 2007 and march 2011 was undertaken. cases with the clinical diagnosis of endophthalmitis resulting from intravitreal injection were identified and reviewed. results: a total of 5,236 intravitreal anti-vegf injections (1,209 intravitreal injections of bevacizumab, 3,827 injections of ranibizumab, and 200 injections of pegaptanib sodium) had been administered. five patients (0.095%), all of whom had received bevacizumab, were diagnosed as having endophthalmitis after the intravitreal injection. all patients visited the institutes for re-examination within 1-2 days after the injection. among the 5 patients, 2 (0.038%) were culture positive for streptococcus oralis and enterococcus faecalis, respectively. the remaining 3 eyes (0.057%) developed presumed noninfectious endophthalmitis. conclusion: although endophthalmitis is a rare complication associated with intravitreal injection, in this series intravitreal anti-vegf injection caused infectious or noninfectious endophthalmitis at a relatively high frequency. further investigations are needed to consider an appropriate injection protocol for minimizing the incidence rates  of endophthalmitis, and to assess the optimal treatment protocol for intravitreal injection-related endophthalmitis although it was difficult to differentiate these two entities.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == [recurrent infective endocarditis. a case report].
AB  == we report the case of a 63-year old patient presenting five infective endocarditis (ie) in a 13-years period, with different types of streptococcus. no entrance way had been found until the last relapse occurring on mitro-aortic bioprosthesis. this recurrence leads to the diagnosis of caecal adenocarcinoma by coloscopy, preceded and guided by pet scanner. it seems to be the initial entrance way which had been unrecognized because of its small size and its particular location, that is very difficult to observe by coloscopy. recurrent streptococcus ie are rare and severe. when a gut or colic tumor is suspected, pet scan seems to be helpful in etiological survey.

TI  == differentiation of streptococcus pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak isolates by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus [pnc]) is a causative agent of many infectious diseases, including pneumonia, septicemia, otitis media, and conjunctivitis. there have been documented conjunctivitis outbreaks in which nontypeable (nt), nonencapsulated pnc has been identified as the etiological agent. the use of mass spectrometry to comparatively and differentially analyze protein and peptide profiles of whole-cell microorganisms remains somewhat uncharted. in this report, we discuss a comparative proteomic analysis between nt s. pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak strains (cpnc) and other known typeable or  nt pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates (including pnc tigr4 and r6, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes) and nonstreptococcal isolates (including escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus) as controls. cpnc cells and controls were grown to mid-log phase, harvested, and subsequently treated with a 10% trifluoroacetic acid-sinapinic acid matrix mixture. protein and peptide fragments of the whole-cell bacterial isolate-matrix combinations ranging in size from 2 to 14 kda were evaluated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. additionally random forest analytical tools and dendrogramic representations (genesis) suggested similarities and clustered the isolates into distinct clonal groups, respectively. also, a peak list of protein and peptide masses was obtained and compared to a known pnc protein mass library, in which a peptide common and unique to cpnc isolates was tentatively identified. information gained from this  study will lead to the identification and validation of proteins that are commonly and exclusively expressed in cpnc strains which could potentially be used as a biomarker in the rapid diagnosis of pneumococcal conjunctivitis.

TI  == bacterial profiles of root caries in elderly patients.
AB  == culture-based studies have shown that streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli are associated with root caries (rc). the purpose of the present study was to assess  the bacterial diversity of rc in elderly patients by use of culture-independent molecular techniques and to determine the associations of specific bacterial species or bacterial communities with healthy and carious roots. plaque was collected from root surfaces of 10 control subjects with no rc and from 11 subjects with rc. the bacterial 16s rrna genes from extracted dna were pcr amplified, cloned, and sequenced to determine species identity. from a total of 3,544 clones, 245 predominant species or phylotypes were observed, representing eight bacterial phyla. the majority (54%) of the species detected have not yet been cultivated. species of selenomonas and veillonella were common in all samples. the healthy microbiota included fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, leptotrichia spp., selenomonas noxia, streptococcus cristatus, and kingella oralis. lactobacilli were absent, s. mutans was present in one, and actinomyces spp. were present in 50% of the controls. in contrast, the microbiota of the rc subjects was dominated by actinomyces spp., lactobacilli, s. mutans, enterococcus faecalis, selenomonas sp. clone cs002, atopobium and olsenella spp., prevotella multisaccharivorax, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and propionibacterium sp. strain fma5. the bacterial profiles of rc showed considerable subject-to-subject variation, indicating that the microbial communities are more complex than previously presumed. the data suggest that putative etiological agents of rc include not only s. mutans, lactobacilli, and actinomyces but also species of atopobium, olsenella, pseudoramibacter, propionibacterium, and selenomonas.

TI  == bacterial and candida albicans adhesion on rapid prototyping-produced 3d-scaffolds manufactured as bone replacement materials.
AB  == rapid prototyping (rp)-produced scaffolds are gaining increasing importance in scaffold-guided tissue engineering. microbial adhesion on the surface of replacement materials has a strong influence on healing and long-term outcome. consequently, it is important to examine the adherence of microorganisms on rp-produced scaffolds. this research focussed on manufacturing of scaffolds by 3d-bioplotting and examination of their microbial adhesion characteristics. tricalciumphosphate (tcp), calcium/sodium alginate, and poly(lactide-co-glycolic  acid) (plga) constructs were produced and used to study the adhesion of dental pathogens. six oral bacterial strains, one candida strain and human saliva were used for the adhesion studies. the number of colony forming units (cfu) were determined and scanning electron microscopy (sem) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) were performed. microorganisms adhered to all scaffolds. all strains, except for streptococcus oralis, adhered best to plga scaffolds. streptococcus oralis adhered to each of the biomaterials equally. streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis adhered best to plga scaffolds, followed by alginate and tcp. prevotella nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus  sanguis, and candida albicans showed the highest adherence to plga, followed by tcp and alginate. in contrast, the microorganisms of saliva adhered significantly better to tcp, followed by plga and alginate. sem observations correlated with the results of the cfu determinations. clsm detected bacteria within deeper sheets of alginate. in conclusion, because of the high adherence rate of oral pathogens to the scaffolds, the application of these biomaterials for bone replacement in oral surgery could result in biomaterial-related infections. strategies to decrease microbial adherence and to prevent infections due to oral  pathogens are discussed.

TI  == antibody binding to streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis cell fractions.
AB  == objective: to determine which cell fraction(s) of streptococcus mitis biovar 1 serve as the best source of antigens recognized by salivary siga antibodies in infants. design: whole cells of 38 reference and wild-type isolates of s. mitis,  streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, enterococcus casseliflavus, and enterococcus faecalis were fractionated into cell walls (cw), protease-treated cell walls (ptcw), cell membranes (cm) and cell protein (cp). whole cells and these fractions were tested for binding by rabbit anti-s. mitis sk145 and anti-s. oralis sk100 sera, and also by salivary siga antibodies from infants and adults.  results: anti-sk145 and anti-sk100 sera bound whole cells and fractions of all strains of s. mitis and s. oralis variably. cluster analysis of antibody binding  data placed the strains into s. mitis, s. oralis and 'non-s. mitis/non-s. oralis' clusters. antigens from cw and cm best discriminated s. mitis from s. oralis. cm  bound the most infant salivary siga antibody and ptcw bound the least. in contrast, adult salivary siga antibody bound all of the cell fractions and at higher levels. conclusions: presumably the relatively short period of immune stimulation and immunological immaturity in infants, in contrast to adults, result in low levels of salivary siga antibody that preferentially bind cm of s.  mitis but not ptcw. by utilizing isolated cell walls and membranes as sources of  antigens for proteomics it may be possible to identify antigens common to oral streptococci and dissect the fine specificity of salivary siga antibodies induced by oral colonization by s. mitis.

TI  == response to alkaline stress by root canal bacteria in biofilms.
AB  == aim: to determine whether bacteria isolated from infected root canals survive alkaline shifts better in biofilms than in planktonic cultures. methodology: clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus paracasei, olsenella uli, streptococcus anginosus, s. gordonii, s. oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum  in biofilm and planktonic cultures were stressed at ph 10.5 for 4 h, and cell viability determined using the fluorescent staining live/dead baclight bacterial  viability kit. in addition, proteins released into extracellular culture fluids were identified by western blotting. results: enterococcus faecalis, l. paracasei, o. uli and s. gordonii survived in high numbers in both planktonic cultures and in biofilms after alkaline challenge. s. anginosus, s. oralis and f. nucleatum showed increased viability in biofilms compared with planktonic cultures. alkaline exposure caused all planktonic cultures to aggregate into clusters and resulted in a greater extrusion of cellular proteins compared with cells in biofilms. increased levels of dnak, hpr and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase were observed in culture fluids, especially amongst streptococci. conclusions: in general, bacteria isolated from infected roots canals resisted alkaline stress better in biofilms than in planktonic cultures, however, planktonic cells appeared to use aggregation and the extracellular transport of specific proteins as survival mechanisms.

TI  == linezolid in prophylaxis against experimental aortic valve endocarditis due to streptococcus oralis or enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == there are no experimental studies regarding the prophylactic efficacy of linezolid against infective endocarditis. nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis of the aortic valve was induced in rabbits by the insertion of a polyethylene catheter. twenty-four hours later, animals were randomly assigned to a control group, and groups receiving either ampicillin (two doses of 40 mg/kg of body weight each, given intravenously, 2 h apart) or linezolid (a single per os dose of 75 mg/kg). the first dose of ampicillin and the single dose of linezolid were  administered 0.5 and 1 h, respectively, prior to the intravenous inoculation of approximately 10(7) cfu of streptococcus oralis or enterococcus faecalis. linezolid peak levels in rabbit serum were similar to the peak serum levels in humans following a 600-mg oral dose of linezolid. linezolid prevented endocarditis in 87% of s. oralis-challenged rabbits (p < 0.001 versus controls; p = 0.026 versus ampicillin). in rabbits challenged with e. faecalis, linezolid prevented endocarditis in 73% (p = 0.003 versus controls; p = 0.049 versus ampicillin). ampicillin prevented endocarditis due to s. oralis or due to e. faecalis in 47% (p = 0.005 versus controls) and in 30% (p = not significant versus controls) of the challenged animals, respectively. in conclusion, linezolid was effective as prophylaxis against endocarditis caused by a strain of s. oralis and to a lesser degree against that caused by a strain of e. faecalis.  its prophylactic efficacy was superior to that of ampicillin.

TI  == characterisation of viridans group streptococci with different levels of tet(m)-mediated tetracycline resistance.
AB  == streptococcus oralis 264-3, streptococcus mitis 254-1 and s. mitis 264-1, isolated from the oral cavities of two children were each found to carry the tet(m) gene but exhibited different degrees of reduced susceptibility to tetracycline (tetracycline mics of 2, 8 and 64 mg/l, respectively). the aim of this study was to determine the molecular basis for the different levels of tetracycline resistance (tc(r)) observed. escherichia coli hb101 carrying the cloned tet(m) genes exhibited similar levels of tetracycline susceptibility to those observed in the parental streptococcal strains (mics of 1, 16, and 64 mg/l  for tet(m) genes from s. oralis 264-3, s. mitis 254-1 and s. mitis 264-1, respectively). dna sequencing revealed that s. oralis 264-3 had a tet(m) gene highly homologous to tet(m) carried by tn916 from enterococcus faecalis (99.6% identity), while the intermediate- and high-level tc(r) strains had tet(m) sequences that resembled the tet(m) gene of tn5251 from streptococcus pneumoniae  (99.3% and 99.4% identity, respectively). no differences were observed in the upstream attenuator structure for each of the strains and differences in reduced  tetracycline susceptibilities could be attributed to changes in the deduced amino acid sequences of the tet(m) proteins.

TI  == gram-positive mera gene in gram-negative oral and urine bacteria.
AB  == clinical mercury resistant (hg(r)) gram-negative bacteria carrying gram-positive  mercury reductase (mera)-like genes were characterized using dna-dna hybridization, pcr and sequencing. a pcr assay was developed which discriminated  between the mera genes related to staphylococcus and those related to the bacillus/streptococcus mera genes by the difference in size of the pcr product. dna sequence analysis correlated with the pcr assay. the mera genes from acinetobacter junii, enterobacter cloacae and escherichia coli were sequenced and shared 98-99% identical nucleotide (nt) and 99.6-100% amino acid identity with the staphylococcus aureus mera protein. a fourth mera gene, from pantoeae agglomerans, was partially sequenced (60%) and had 99% identical nt and 100% amino acid identity with the streptococcus oralis mera protein. all the hg(r) gram-negative bacteria transferred their gram-positive mera genes to a gram-positive enterococcus faecalis recipient with the resulting transconjugants  expressing mercury resistance. these gram-positive mera genes join gram-positive  tetracycline resistance and gram-positive macrolide resistance genes in their association with mobile elements which are able to transfer and express in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == in vitro modeling of dental water line contamination and decontamination.
AB  == the contamination of dental unit water lines (duwl) is an emerging concern in dentistry. the aim of this study was to use an in vitro duwl to model microbial contamination and evaluate the decontamination efficacy of tetraacetylethylenediamine (taed) solutions. a duwl biofilm model used to simulate clinical conditions was used to generate a range of biofilms in duwl. three distinct biofilms were generated: (1) biofilm from water, (2) biofilm from  a mix of water + contaminating human commensal bacteria, (3) biofilm from water with contaminating oral bacteria added after biofilm formed. the contaminating oral species used were streptococcus oralis, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus. decontamination by simple water flushing or flushing with  taed was evaluated (2, 5 and 10 min intervals). the duwl tubes were split and samples were plated onto a range of media, incubated and bacteria enumerated. water flushing did not reduce the number of microorganisms detected. bacteria were not detected from any of the taed sampling points for any of the biofilm types tested. interestingly, if contamination was introduced to new duwl along with the waterborne species a biofilm was formed containing only the waterborne species. if however, an existing biofilm was present before the introduction of "contaminating" bacteria then these could be detected in the biofilm. this implies that if the duwl are new or satisfactorily cleaned on a regular basis then the associated cross-contamination aspects are reduced. in conclusion, taed  provides effective control for duwl biofilms.

TI  == apical periodontitis development and bacterial response to endodontic treatment.  experimental root canal infections in monkeys with selected bacterial strains.
AB  == in six monkeys, 160 root canals were inoculated with a combination of four bacterial strains belonging to species streptococcus milleri, peptostreptococcus  anaerobius, prevotella oralis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. in two other monkeys, 24 root canals were inoculated with a five-strain combination consisting of these strains and a strain of enterococcus faecalis. all strains were previously isolated from an infected monkey root canal. after 8-12 months, survival of the strains was recorded bacteriologically, and the reaction in the periapical region was radiographed. from 180 of 184 root canals, one or more of the bacterial strains were reisolated. the two facultative strains were more frequently reisolated than the anaerobic strains. apical periodontitis was registered in the periapical region of more than 96% of root canals with reisolated bacteria but in none of those without reisolated bacteria. endodontic treatment was carried out in two sessions with an interval of 14 d without interappointment dressings, and  the effect was evaluated bacteriologically before and after each treatment. the chemo-mechanical treatment reduced significantly the number of strains and bacterial cells. the facultative bacteria were more resistant to the treatment than the anaerobic bacteria. the five-strain combination had a higher survival rate than the four-strain combination.

TI  == potential utility of a peptide deformylase inhibitor (nvp pdf-713) against oxazolidinone-resistant or streptogramin-resistant gram-positive organism isolates.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the potency of a novel peptide deformylase inhibitor, nvp pdf-713, against gram-positive organisms having resistances to linezolid or quinupristin/dalfopristin. materials and methods: a total of 45 strains from three genera (six species groups) were tested by reference broth microdilution methods. the mechanism of resistance to the oxazolidinone was determined by sequencing of the gene encoding the ribosomal target. results: nvp pdf-713 retained activity against linezolid-resistant staphylococci (mic range 0.25-2 mg/l), streptococcus oralis (mic 0.5 mg/l), enterococcus faecalis (mic range 2-4  mg/l) and enterococcus faecium (mic range 0.5-4 mg/l). quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant e. faecium (mic range 1-2 mg/l) and staphylococci (mic range 0.12-2 mg/l) were also inhibited by nvp pdf-713. many (10 of 13 strains) of the linezolid-resistant enterococci were resistant to vancomycin and these clinical strains had a g2576u ribosomal target mutation. conclusions: nvp pdf-713 appears to be a promising clinical candidate among the peptide deformylase inhibitors for the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive organisms that possess resistances to oxazolidinones or streptogramin combinations.

TI  == in vitro activities of garenoxacin (bms-284756) against streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci, and enterococcus faecalis compared to those of six other quinolones.
AB  == the activity of garenoxacin, a new quinolone, was determined in comparison with other quinolones against different strains of s. pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci (vgs), and enterococcus faecalis. strains were quinolone-susceptible clinical isolates and quinolone-resistant strains with defined mechanisms of resistance obtained from either clinical isolates or derivatives of s. pneumoniae r6. clinical quinolone-susceptible strains of s. pneumoniae, vgs and e. faecalis  showed garenoxacin mics within a range of 0.03 microg/ml to 0.25 micro g/ml. garenoxacin mics increased two- to eightfold when one mutation was present in the parc quinolone resistance-determining region (qrdr), fourfold when one mutation was present in the gyra qrdr (s. pneumoniae), 8- to 64-fold when two or three mutations were associated in parc and gyra qrdr, and 2,048-fold when two mutations were present in both the gyra and parc qrdrs (streptococcus pneumoniae). increased active efflux had a moderate effect on garenoxacin mics for s. pneumoniae and vgs. against s. pneumoniae, garenoxacin behaved like moxifloxacin and sparfloxacin, being more affected by a single gyra mutation than by a single parc mutation. although garenoxacin was generally two- to fourfold more active than moxifloxacin against the different wild-type or mutant strains of s. pneumoniae, vgs, and e. faecalis, it was two- to fourfold less active than  gemifloxacin. at four times the respective mic for each strain, the bactericidal  effect of garenoxacin, observed at 6 h for s. pneumoniae and at 24 h for s. oralis and e. faecalis, was not influenced by the presence of mutation either in  the parc or in both the parc and gyra qrdrs.

TI  == linezolid resistance since 2001: sentry antimicrobial surveillance program.
AB  == background: the oxazolidinone class of antimicrobials has demonstrated remarkable activity against gram-positive cocci. linezolid has proven to be a first-line therapeutic option for vancomycin-resistant strains. linezolid clinical trial results and subsequent published case reports cite rare resistance emerging in patients receiving prolonged therapy. objective: to report the initial linezolid-resistant organisms from cases obtained through the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, after screening >40,000 gram-positive cocci without resistance between 1998 and 2000. methods: during 2001-2002, 8 resistant  strains (from 8 different patients) located in 6 states from 7 different participating sentry institutions in the us were identified among bloodstream, respiratory, skin and soft tissue, and urinary tract infection isolates of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus oralis. resistance was detected by reference broth microdilution methods and confirmed by identical results using etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) and the standardized disk diffusion method. results: minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and disk diffusion tests showed elevated mics (> or =8 microg/ml) and small inhibitory zone diameters (< or =15 mm) for all strains to both linezolid and the investigational oxazolidinone azd2563. vancomycin resistance was detected in 2 of the 8 linezolid-resistant strains. all enterococci and the viridans-group streptococcus (s. oralis) strain showed resistance to erythromycin. e. faecium strains were resistant to penicillins, but susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin. only 3 of the patients had previously received the drug. conclusions: linezolid resistance remains rare, with only 8 isolates among 9833 (0.08%) monitored isolates identified between january 1, 2001, and june 30, 2002. resistance, however, was no longer limited to enterococci. clinical laboratories should test linezolid more widely to detect emerging resistance, especially for patients receiving oxazolidinone therapy. longitudinal surveillance programs are warranted to detect a trend in the development of resistance, determine the molecular mechanism of resistance, and recommend alternative therapies or epidemiologic interventions.

TI  == inhibition by yeast killer toxin-like antibodies of oral streptococci adhesion to tooth surfaces in an ex vivo model.
AB  == background: monoclonal (ktmab) and recombinant (ktscfv) anti-idiotypic antibodies, representing the internal image of a yeast killer toxin, proved to be microbicidal in vitro against important eukaryotic and prokaryotic pathogens such as candida albicans, pneumocystis carinii, mycobacterium tuberculosis, staphylococcus aureus, s. haemolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae, including multidrug-resistant strains. ktmab and ktscfv exerted a strong therapeutic effect in well-established animal models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis. streptococcus mutans is the most important etiologic agent of dental caries that might result from the metabolic end products of dental plaque. effective strategies to reduce the disease potential of dental plaque have considered the possibility of using antibiotics or antibodies against oral streptococci in general and s. mutans in particular. in this study, the activity of ktmab and ktscfv against s. mutans and the inhibition and reduction by ktmab of dental colonization by s. mutans and other oral streptococci in an ex vivo model of human teeth were investigated. materials and  methods: ktscfv and ktmab were used in a conventional colony forming unit (cfu) assay against a serotype c strain of s. mutans, and other oral streptococci (s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius). an ex vivo model of human teeth submerged in saliva was used to establish ktmab potential of inhibiting or reducing the adhesion to dental surfaces by s. mutans and other oral streptococci. results: ktmab and ktscfv kill in vitro s. mutans and other oral streptococci. ktmab inhibit colonization of dental surfaces by s. mutans and oral streptococci in the ex vivo model. conclusions: killer antibodies with antibiotic activity or their engineered derivatives may have a potential in the prevention of dental caries in vivo.

TI  == [therapeutic impact of streptococcal and enterococcal bacteremia in hematology patients].
AB  == from january 1999 to may 2000 (17 months), 21 strains of streptococci and four strains of enterococci have been isolated from 74 blood cultures in 25 infectious episodes in hematologic patients. they concerned 21 patients, of 21 to 77 years old. these patients suffered from acute leukaemia (14 cases), chronic lymphoid leukaemia (two cases), non-hodgkin's lymphoma (two cases) or myeloma (three cases). seventeen patients displayed a single streptococcal or enterococcal episode, two had two episodes in the course of a single stay in the hospital, two others in the course of two different stays. during 16 episodes (64%), the bacteremia occurred within 15 days after the onset of neutropenia consecutive to  antimitotic chemotherapy, and in nine episodes (36%) it has occurred after a period exceeding 15 days. in six cases the patients had already received antibiotics with a large antibacterial activity (beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone and/or glycopeptide +/- aminoside) and in four cases a single antibiotic (synergistine or cotrimoxazole). most streptococci (20/21) were oral streptococci (ten streptococcus mitis, five s. oralis, two s. sanguis, three s. pneumoniae). a single strain of beta-hemolytic streptococci has been identified as s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. the enterococci were one strain of enterococcus  faecalis and three e. faecium. ten streptococci were susceptible to 0.25 mg/l of  penicillin g, ten were less susceptible (0.5 < or = mic < 32 mg/l), and a strain  was resistant (mic = 32 mg/l). eighteen strains were susceptible to amoxicillin and cefotaxime. for three strains, the mics of amoxicillin and cefotaxime (8-16 mg/l and 8-32 mg/l, respectively) were higher. levels of resistance of the enterococci to the beta-lactam (penicillin, amoxicillin, and piperacillin) were variable. all species were susceptible to glycopeptides. three patients were transferred in intensive care unit for respiratory distress or shock syndrome. their evolution has remained severe under antibiotherapy comprising beta-lactam or vancomycin associated with an aminoside. this results demonstrate the interest of species identification to adapt the antibiotic treatment and confirms the frequency of oral streptococci in severe bacteremia in neutropenic patients.

TI  == humoral immunity to commensal oral bacteria in human infants: salivary secretory  immunoglobulin a antibodies reactive with streptococcus mitis biovar 1, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, and enterococcus faecalis during the  first two years of life.
AB  == secretory immunoglobulin a (siga) antibodies reactive with the pioneer oral streptococci streptococcus mitis biovar 1 and streptococcus oralis, the late oral colonizer streptococcus mutans, and the pioneer enteric bacterium enterococcus faecalis in saliva samples from 10 human infants from birth to age 2 years were analyzed. low levels of salivary siga1 and siga2 antibodies reactive with whole cells of all four species were detected within the first month after birth, even  though s. mutans and e. faecalis were not recovered from the mouths of the infants during the study period. although there was a fivefold increase in the concentration of siga between birth and age 2 years, there were no differences between the concentrations of siga1 and siga2 antibodies reactive with the four species over this time period. when the concentrations of siga1 and siga2 antibodies reactive with all four species were normalized to the concentrations of siga1 and siga2 in saliva, siga1 and siga2 antibodies reactive with these bacteria showed a significant decrease from birth to 2 years of age. adsorption of each infant's saliva with cells of one species produced a dramatic reduction of antibodies recognizing the other three species. sequential adsorption of saliva samples removed all siga antibody to the bacteria, indicating that the siga antibodies were directed to antigens shared by all four species. the induction by the host of a limited immune response to common antigens that are likely not involved in adherence may be among the mechanisms that commensal streptococci employ to persist in the oral cavity.

TI  == serum antibodies reacting with subgingival species in refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the levels of serum igg antibody to 85 subgingival species in 32 refractory periodontitis, 56 successfully treated, and 33 periodontally healthy subjects. refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or >3 sites showing attachment loss >2.5 mm within 1 year after 2 treatment modalities, scaling and root planing and surgery plus systemically administered tetracycline. successfully-treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss >2.5 mm, 1 year post-therapy. periodontally healthy subjects exhibited no pocket or attachment level >3 mm, and no evidence of progressing attachment loss during 1 year of monitoring. baseline serum was obtained from each subject and tested against 85 subgingival species, including reference strains and strains isolated from refractory subjects, using checkerboard immunoblotting. significance of differences in levels of serum antibody among groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis test. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based  on their serum antibody response to subgingival species. some individuals had antibody reactions to many subgingival species, while other subjects showed fewer or low numbers of responses. on average, refractory subjects exhibited higher numbers and levels of serum antibody reactions to a wide range of subgingival species than successfully treated or periodontally healthy subjects. differences  in serum antibody among clinical groups were more striking at higher threshold levels of antibody (>50 microg/ml and > 100 microg/ml). the data showed that a subject was 10.1 x more likely to be refractory if the subject exhibited antibody reactions with >9 subgingival species at >50 microg/ml (p<0.001, after adjusting  for multiple comparisons). serum antibody to a subset of the test species differed among the clinical groups. porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroidesforsythus, and some strains isolated from refractory subjects (a novel neisseria sp., enterococcus faecalis, prevotella loescheii and prevotella oulora) elicited high serum antibody in the successfully treated and refractory subjects. high levels of serum antibody to a microbacterium lacticum-like organism, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus constellatus, actinobacillus actinonmycetemcomitans serotype c and haemophilus aphrophilus significantly increased the likelihood of a subject being refractory to conventional periodontal therapy.

TI  == successful single-dose teicoplanin prophylaxis against experimental streptococcal, enterococcal, and staphylococcal aortic valve endocarditis.
AB  == teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that is administered both intramuscularly and intravenously. it has a prolonged half-life and a less toxic  profile in comparison to those of vancomycin. the efficacy of a single dose of teicoplanin (18 mg/kg of body weight given intramuscularly) for the prevention of endocarditis due to streptococcus oralis, enterococcus faecium, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was evaluated after applying the rabbit model. vancomycin at a single dose of 30 mg/kg given intravenously was used as the comparative agent for the prevention of endocarditis due to mrsa and  e. faecium, while ampicillin at a single dose of 40 mg/kg given intravenously was used as the comparative agent for the prevention of endocarditis due to s. oralis. rabbits in the teicoplanin group were infected at 1 h postdosing with approximately 10(7) cfu of each strain. rabbits in the other groups were infected at 0.5 h postdosing with approximately 10(7) cfu of s. oralis (ampicillin group)  or e. faecium and mrsa (vancomycin group). all rabbits were sacrificed 5 days later. teicoplanin and vancomycin protected the animals challenged with e. faecium by 87.5 and 50%, respectively, and protected the animals challenged with  mrsa by 100 and 92%, respectively. teicoplanin and ampicillin protected the animals challenged with s. oralis by 100 and 77%, respectively. prevention of endocarditis by teicoplanin was likely to be due to a prolonged inhibition of bacterial growth by the sustained supra-mics. it is concluded that teicoplanin is very effective in preventing experimental streptococcal, enterococcal, and staphylococcal endocarditis and may be an attractive alternative antibiotic in patients allergic to beta-lactams, especially in the outpatient setting.

TI  == comparison of the indigenous oral microbiota and immunoglobulin responses of athymic (nu/nu) and euthymic (nu/+) mice.
AB  == the role of the immune system in the homeostasis of indigenous oral bacterial populations is poorly understood. in this study, we compared the evolution of the indigenous oral microbiota of specific pathogen-free athymic nude (nu/nu) balb/c  mice with that of their corresponding phenotypically normal (nu/-) littermates. we also evaluated corresponding salivary and serum antibody activities (iga and igg) against the predominant indigenous oral bacteria. the bacterial species recovered from the two mouse strains were lactobacillus murinus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus oralis and staphylococcus epidermidis. from 27 days of age, nu/+ and nu/nu mice had significantly different proportions of oral bacterial populations. when the microbiota stabilized (at 40 days of age), the total cultivable microbiota of nu/+ mice was dominated by l. murinus (65-85%), while that of nu/nu mice was dominated by e. faecalis (40-60%). the precise factors that alter the oral resident microbiota in nu/nu mice are unknown. we found that total salivary iga levels were significantly lower in nu/nu mice, but  no association were observed between the level of salivary iga antibody against indigenous bacteria and the proportion of these indigenous bacteria in the oral microbiota. the change in the microbiota of nude mice may have been caused by other factors such as defects in other immune functions or cold stress.

TI  == the endodontic microflora revisited.
AB  == the microbial flora of 35 dental root canals were examined, taking care to maintain the viability of obligate anaerobes which accounted for 45% of total isolations, while streptococcal species accounted for 24% of the total species isolated. individual root canals yielded a maximum of eight bacterial species. a  total of 40 different species was isolated of which the most prevalent were the facultative anaerobe streptococcus sanguis and the obligate anaerobe, peptostreptococcus micros (both in 23% of root canals), followed by eubacterium aerofaciens and the 'streptococcus milleri group' (both 17%) then prevotella melaninogenica (formerly bacteroides melaninogenicus), enterococcus faecalis and  prevotella oralis (formerly bacteroides oralis), which were each isolated from 14% of root canals. highly significant associations were discovered between four  pairs of species, viz p. melaninogenica with p. micros, p. melaninogenica with p. oralis, prevotella corporis with streptococcus morbillorum and actinomyces odontolyticus with e. faecalis.

TI  == coaggregation of streptococcus sanguis and other streptococci with candida albicans.
AB  == thirteen strains of viridans group streptococci and two strains of other streptococci were tested for coaggregation with candida albicans. streptococcus sanguis strains generally exhibited low levels of adherence to 28 degrees c-grown exponential-phase yeast cells, but starvation of yeast cells for glucose at 37 degrees c (or at 28 degrees c) increased their coaggregating activity with these  streptococci by at least tenfold. this was a property common to four c. albicans  strains tested, two of which were able to form mycelia (6406 and men) and two of  which were not (mm2002 and ca2). the expression of the coaggregation adhesin during yeast cell starvation was inhibited by addition of trichodermin or amphotericin b. the strains of s. sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus oralis tested for coaggregating activity encompassed a diverse range of physiological and morphological types, yet all exhibited saturable coaggregation with starved c. albicans cells. there was no correlation of cell surface hydrophobicity, of either yeast or streptococcal cells, with their abilities to coaggregate. strains of streptococcus anginosus also coaggregated with starved yeast cells; streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus pyogenes coaggregated to a lesser degree with c. albicans, and the coaggregation with s. pyogenes was not promoted by yeast cell starvation; streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis did not coaggregate with yeast. the coaggregation reactions of s. sanguis and s. gordonii with c. albicans were inhibited by edta and by heat or protease treatment of the yeast cells and were not reversible by the addition  of lactose or other simple sugars. these observations extend the range of intergeneric coaggregations that are known to occur between oral microbes and suggest that coaggregations of c. albicans with viridans group streptococci may be important for colonization of oral surfaces by the yeast.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of streptococcus.
AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. the major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (s. faecalis, s. faecium, 's. avium' and a proposed new species 's. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (s. bovis, s. equinus, s. salivarius, 's. casseliflavus', s. mutans, s. raffinolactis and an unidentified oral group i); (c) lactic species group (s. lactis including s. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (s. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (s. mitis, s. sanguis, a proposed new species 's. oralis' and 's. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. equi, 's. equisimilis' including 's. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of lancefield group b strains of human origin);  (g) parapyogenic species group (s. uberis, 's. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of lancefield groups r, s and t). species of aerococcus, gemella, leuconostoc and pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.

TI  == apical periodontitis induced by selected bacterial strains in root canals of immunized and nonimmunized monkeys.
AB  == experimental infections in root canals with streptococcus faecalis ss. liquefaciens (strep-mc4). actinomyces bovis (act-mc6) and bacteroides oralis (bact-mc3) were studied in four immunized and five nonimmunized monkeys. the immunization was performed using antigens of the homologous strains. the antibody level was checked by gel diffusion. in 56 root canals of the immunized animals and 60 root canals of the nonimmunized animals, viable cells of the three bacterial strains were enclosed in equal amounts of various combinations. after 6 months, samples from the root canals were subjected to qualitative and quantitative bacteriologic analyses and the apical area was radiographically and  histologically examined. the analyses revealed no significant difference between  the two groups of monkeys, although the viable cell recovery was slightly higher  in most of the root canals of nonimmunized monkeys. the cell proportion of the strains within the different bacterial combinations was equal in root canals of the two groups of animals. the radiographic and histologic examinations revealed  no significant difference between the two groups of animals regarding the number  of teeth with periapical lesions. the radiographic examination, however, showed a more distinct limitation of the process in the immunized than in the nonimmunized monkeys. histologically the lesions were more encapsulated and had a sparser cell infiltration in immunized than in nonimmunized monkeys. in the latter, inflammatory cells had often infiltrated the bone. mixed infections gave a more severe periapical reaction than single strain infections in both animal groups.
