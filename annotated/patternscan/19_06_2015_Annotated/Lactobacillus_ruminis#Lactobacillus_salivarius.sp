TI  == identification and characterization of intestinal lactobacilli strains capable of degrading immunotoxic peptides present in gluten.
AB  == aim: identify and characterize bacteria from the proximal gastrointestinal tract  of pigs capable of degrading immunogenic gluten peptides. methods and results: bacteria were cultured from the small intestine of pigs fed a 20% gluten diet and from an enrichment media with the 18-mer peptide lqlqpfpqpqlpypqpql. isolates were screened for the production of specialized proteolytic enzymes and the ability to degrade and remove metastable peptides from alpha-gliadin (16-mer and  33-mer) and omega-gliadin (17-mer), with established roles in the aetiology of coeliac disease. degradation was determined by elisa and mass spectrometry (uhplc-ms/ms in mrm mode), and hydrolysis fragments were characterized by lc-ms/ms. four strains from the species lactobacillus ruminis, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus amylovorus and lactobacillus salivarius showed the highest peptide-degrading activities. strains displayed different degradation rates and cleavage patterns that resulted in reduction but not complete removal of immunotoxic epitopes. conclusions: we employed a unique enrichment process to  select for bacteria adapted to the conditions of the proximal gastrointestinal tract with the ability to partially detoxify well-characterized peptides involved in coeliac disease. significance and impact of the study: this study provides a basis for the selection of lactobacillus strains for probiotic applications aimed to reduce epitope-containing gluten peptides before reaching the epithelium of the small intestine of patients with coeliac disease.

TI  == catabolic flexibility of mammalian-associated lactobacilli.
AB  == metabolic flexibility may be generally defined as "the capacity for the organism  to adapt fuel oxidation to fuel availability". the metabolic diversification strategies used by individual bacteria vary greatly from the use of novel or acquired enzymes to the use of plasmid-localised genes and transporters. in this  review, we describe the ability of lactobacilli to utilise a variety of carbon sources from their current or new environments in order to grow and survive. the  genus lactobacillus now includes more than 150 species, many with adaptive capabilities, broad metabolic capacity and species/strain variance. they are therefore, an informative example of a cell factory capable of adapting to new niches with differing nutritional landscapes. indeed, lactobacilli naturally colonise and grow in a wide variety of environmental niches which include the roots and foliage of plants, silage, various fermented foods and beverages, the human vagina and the mammalian gastrointestinal tract (git; including the mouth,  stomach, small intestine and large intestine). here we primarily describe the metabolic flexibility of some lactobacilli isolated from the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, and we also describe some of the food-associated species  with a proven ability to adapt to the git. as examples this review concentrates on the following species - lb. plantarum, lb. acidophilus, lb. ruminis, lb. salivarius, lb. reuteri and lb. sakei, to highlight the diversity and inter-relationships between the catabolic nature of species within the genus.

TI  == genome sequences and comparative genomics of two lactobacillus ruminis strains from the bovine and human intestinal tracts.
AB  == background: the genus lactobacillus is characterized by an extraordinary degree of phenotypic and genotypic diversity, which recent genomic analyses have further highlighted. however, the choice of species for sequencing has been non-random and unequal in distribution, with only a single representative genome from the l. salivarius clade available to date. furthermore, there is no data to facilitate a functional genomic analysis of motility in the lactobacilli, a trait that is restricted to the l. salivarius clade. results: the 2.06 mb genome of the bovine  isolate lactobacillus ruminis atcc 27782 comprises a single circular chromosome,  and has a g+c content of 44.4%. in silico analysis identified 1901 coding sequences, including genes for a pediocin-like bacteriocin, a single large exopolysaccharide-related cluster, two sortase enzymes, two crispr loci and numerous is elements and pseudogenes. a cluster of genes related to a putative pilin was identified, and shown to be transcribed in vitro. a high quality draft  assembly of the genome of a second l. ruminis strain, atcc 25644 isolated from humans, suggested a slightly larger genome of 2.138 mb, that exhibited a high degree of synteny with the atcc 27782 genome. in contrast, comparative analysis of l. ruminis and l. salivarius identified a lack of long-range synteny between these closely related species. comparison of the l. salivarius clade core proteins with those of nine other lactobacillus species distributed across 4 major phylogenetic groups identified the set of shared proteins, and proteins unique to each group. conclusions: the genome of l. ruminis provides a comparative tool for directing functional analyses of other members of the l. salivarius clade, and it increases understanding of the divergence of this distinct lactobacillus lineage from other commensal lactobacilli. the genome sequence provides a definitive resource to facilitate investigation of the genetics, biochemistry and host interactions of these motile intestinal lactobacilli.

TI  == carbohydrate catabolic flexibility in the mammalian intestinal commensal lactobacillus ruminis revealed by fermentation studies aligned to genome annotations.
AB  == background: lactobacillus ruminis is a poorly characterized member of the lactobacillus salivarius clade that is part of the intestinal microbiota of pigs, humans and other mammals. its variable abundance in human and animals may be linked to historical changes over time and geographical differences in dietary intake of complex carbohydrates. results: in this study, we investigated the ability of nine l. ruminis strains of human and bovine origin to utilize fifty carbohydrates including simple sugars, oligosaccharides, and prebiotic polysaccharides. the growth patterns were compared with metabolic pathways predicted by annotation of a high quality draft genome sequence of atcc 25644 (human isolate) and the complete genome of atcc 27782 (bovine isolate). all of the strains tested utilized prebiotics including fructooligosaccharides (fos), soybean-oligosaccharides (sos) and 1,3:1,4-beta-d-gluco-oligosaccharides to varying degrees. six strains isolated from humans utilized fos-enriched inulin, as well as fos. in contrast, three strains isolated from cows grew poorly in fos-supplemented medium. in general, carbohydrate utilisation patterns were strain-dependent and also varied depending on the degree of polymerisation or complexity of structure. six putative operons were identified in the genome of the human isolate atcc 25644 for the transport and utilisation of the prebiotics  fos, galacto-oligosaccharides (gos), sos, and 1,3:1,4-beta-d-gluco-oligosaccharides. one of these comprised a novel fos utilisation operon with predicted capacity to degrade chicory-derived fos. however, only three of these operons were identified in the atcc 27782 genome that might account for the utilisation of only sos and 1,3:1,4-beta-d-gluco-oligosaccharides. conclusions: this study has provided definitive genome-based evidence to support the fermentation patterns of nine strains of lactobacillus ruminis, and has linked it to gene distribution patterns in strains from different sources. furthermore, the study has identified prebiotic carbohydrates with the potential to promote l. ruminis growth in vivo.

TI  == characterization of tetracycline resistance lactobacilli isolated from swine intestines at western area of taiwan.
AB  == to investigate the frequency of tetracycline resistance (tet-r) lactobacilli in pig intestines, a total of 256 pig colons were analyzed and found to contain typical colonies of tet-r lactic acid bacteria in every sample, ranging from 3.2  x 10(3) to 6.6 x 10(5) cfu/cm(2). from these samples, a total of 159 isolates of  tet-r lactobacilli were obtained and identified as belonging to 11 species, including lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus amylovorus, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus ruminis, lactobacillus kefiri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus coryniformis, lactobacillus parabuchneri and lactobacillus letivazi. based on the efsa (2008) breakpoints, all isolates, after mic analysis, were qualified as tet-r, from which the significant high tet-r mic(50) and mic(90) values indicated an ecological distribution of tet-r lactobacilli mostly with high resistance potency in pig colons. pcr-detection identified 5 tet genes in these isolates, the most predominant one being tet (w), followed by tet (m), (l), (k), and (q). their detection rates were 82.0%, 22.5%, 14.4%, 8.1% and 0.9%, respectively. noteworthily, isolates of the same species carrying identical tet gene(s) usually had a wide different mic values. furthermore, strain-subtyping of these isolates  by rep-pcr demonstrated a notable genotypic biodiversity % (average = 62%).

TI  == [analysis of the probiotic bifidobacterium and lactobacillus community in child intestinal flora].
AB  == to investigate the distribution of child intestinal flora and the composition of  its key probiotics community, study on intestinal flora of 21 chinese children (age 2 - 5) was conducted, which included bacteria isolation and counting, 16s rdna sequencing and homology analysis. for identification of the key probiotics such as bifidobacterium and lactobacillus in children feces at the species level, the specific primers im26/im3 and l159/l677 for pcr amplification of partial 16s  rdna were used. the results show that the composition of child intestinal flora is was relatively stable and almost same to the intestinal flora of the youth (age 20 - 25). culture-based approaches show that the key probiotic community in  feces at the species level was highly different in composition and numbers from individual to individual. b. longum and b. pseudocatenulatum, which are detected  at levels of 10(7) cfu/g (wet) in samples and the detection rates are 90.48% and  85.71% respectively, are believed to be major bifidobacterial species in child intestinal microbiota. in addition, b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. infantis and  b. thermacidophium have also been found. l. mucosae, l. fermentum, l. salivarius, l. ruminis, l. gasseri and l. plantarum are isolated from the stools. l. mucosae  (3.68 log10 cfu/g (wet), detection rate 71.43%) and l. fermentum (3.97 log10 cfu/g (wet), detection rate 52.38%) are two dominant species of lactobacillus. study on chinese child intestinal flora, especially on the compositions and numbers of key probiotics in the feces will be very helpful to the development of effective probiotics in future.

TI  == the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora of the human intestine: composition and succession.
AB  == lactobacillus and bifidobacterial cultures are increasingly used as probiotics in pharmaceuticals and in foods. the selection of strains is performed often for technological rather than for microecological reasons. detailed reports about species and strains composition of these microorganisms in the intestinal microflora of man are rare. our investigations were performed with samples originating from infants and adults, taken from faeces and from upper sections of the intestinal tract including mouth and stomach, and from caecum and colon. post mortem cases as well as test subjects under physiological conditions were analyzed using an automatic capsule system sampling at defined times in different parts of the intestinal tract. the fate of selected strains after oral intake was studied, too. furthermore, influences of the microflora originating from food were considered. the identification of autochthonous (indigenous) and allochthonous (transient) species could be achieved with descriptions of new species in the genera lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. l. gasseri and l. reuteri proved to be predominant autochthonous lactobacillus species in infants as well as in adults. both species were occasionally present even in the stomach. this was also the case with an anaerobic lactic acid bacterium, previously named  catenabacterium catenaforme, later classified as l. ruminis, a non-motile variant of this species. the bifidobacterial microflora differed in composition between infants and adults and in different stages of the host's life. up to 5 species or special strains of bifidobacteria could be present in different, individually fixed, combinations. species typical for infants were b. bifidum, b. infantis, b. breve, and b. parvulorum. typical for adults were 4 different variants of b. adolescentis. b. bifidum and b. longum could often be found in both groups, but in lower numbers. b. longum showed some oxygen tolerance whereas b. bifidum and b. adolescentis required strict anaerobic and fastidious conditions for cultivation. the autochthonous lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora in man will remain stable life-long. with lactobacilli, however, some successions may be caused by transient species derived from food or from the oral cavity, thus giving the impression of an altered microflora. nevertheless l. gasseri, l.  reuteri, l. ruminis, and to some degree, l. salivarius, may be present as autochthonous species all of the time. with bifidobacteria, a decreasing tendency in counts and in multiple composition in elderly people exists. furthermore, this microflora is also influenced by consumption habits, which are probably caused by geographical circumstances.

TI  == [lactic bacteria in the digestive tract of poultry].
AB  == lactic bacteria predominate in the microflora of the digestive tract of chicken and turkey. they are represented mainly by lactobacillus acidophilus, l. salivarius, l. fermentum and l. buchneri. streptococcus faecium is always isolated. l. ruminis, l. vitulinus, l. delbrueckii, l. coryniformis and l. viridescens were found in this ecological niche for the first time. s. faecium and s. faecalis prevail in the digestive tract of geese and ducks, while lactobacilli are detected in a lesser amount and are represented mainly by l. plantarum. l. salivarius cells isolated from the digestive tract of poultry are highly polymorphous. most of the lactic acid bacteria found in the digestive tract of poultry can grow at 45-50 degrees c whatever is the species they belong  to.
