TI  == antibacterial activity of native california medicinal plant extracts isolated from rhamnus californica and umbellularia californica.
AB  == background: antimicrobial resistance (amr) is a major threat to global public health. medicinal plants have long been used as remedies for infectious diseases  by native cultures around the world and have the potential for providing effective treatments for antibiotic-resistant infections. rhamnus californica (rhamnaceae) and umbellularia californica (lauraceae) are two indigenous california plant species historically used by native americans to treat skin, respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. this study aimed to assess the in vitro antimicrobial activity of methanolic extracts of leaves and bark of r. and  u. californica against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. methods: methanolic extracts of leaves and bark of r. and u. californica were prepared by soxhlet extraction and  evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against bacillus cereus, streptococcus pyogenes, mycobacterium smegmatis, staphylococcus aureus, mrsa, escherichia coli  and pseudomonas aeruginosa using disc diffusion and minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) assays. chemical profiling of the extracts was performed using standard methods. results: all extracts inhibited the growth of mrsa and other gram-positive bacteria with mics of 3.3-6.0 mg/ml. gram-negative organisms  were unaffected by these extracts. u. californica extracts (leaves and bark) had  the lowest mic values. chemical profiling detected the presence of quinones, alkaloids, flavonoids, cardenolides, tannins and saponins in these extracts. our  study is the first to report the antimicrobial properties of r. and u. californica and illustrates their promising anti-mrsa potential. conclusions: our results give scientific credence to the traditional medicinal uses of these plants by the indigenous peoples of california. further investigation of the secondary metabolites responsible for the antimicrobial activity of these extracts against mrsa is warranted.

TI  == plant-based hydrocarbon esters from tragia involucrata possess antimicrobial and  anti-inflammatory activities.
AB  == antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of hydrocarbon esters obtained from tragia involucrata were evaluated by disk-diffusion (250 microg/ml), and broth-dilution (500-7.8 microg/ml), methods against bacteria. among the compounds, shellsol showed the most potent activity against burkholderia pseudomallei (khw), aeromonas hydrophila, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. interestingly, vinyl hexylether was active against food-spoilage bacteria (bacillus cereus and proteus vulgaris), 2, 4-methyl hexane also exerted antimicrobial activity against k. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, b. pseudomallei, alcaligens viscolactis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. 2-methylnonane  and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane showed only weak activity. for example, shellsol showed bacteriostatic effect (mic of 7.8 microg/ml) against a. hydrophila, vinyl hexylether (mic of 15.6 microg/ml) against p. mirabilis, and 2, 4-methyl hexane (mic of 31.25 microg/ml) on b. pseudomallei. cytotoxic effects of compounds were  assayed in human skin and monkey kidney cells (62.5-2000 microg/ml) by an xtt assay. the vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol did not show any toxicity up to 1000 microg/ml concentrations. the 2-methylnonane and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane induced morphological changes (e.g. cell disintegration and lysis) of both cell types at a 2000 microg/ml. the vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol were devoid of toxic effects; however, 2-methylnonane induced weight loss and severe necrosis as evidenced by histopathological and serum biochemical analysis in rats. interestingly, shellsol showed the maximum inhibition of carrageenan-induced, paw oedema in rats. in conclusion, findings of this study clearly indicate that biologically active hydrocarbon esters, such as shellsol, vinyl hexylether, and 2, 4-dimethyl hexane  isolated from t. involucrata, may effectively control the growth of certain food-borne and food-spoilage pathogens.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of schinus lentiscifolius (anacardiaceae).
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: schinus lentiscifolius marchand (syn. schinus weinmannifolius engl) is a plant native to rio grande do sul (southern brazil) and has been used in brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. material and methods: the crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, three gram negative bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: candida albicans, candida tropicalis, cryptococcus neoformans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two gram positive bacteria, namely, bacillus cereus, enterococcus spp, and six gram negative bacteria, namely, burkholderia cepacia, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis. results: the leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of schinus lentiscifolius showed a  broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (mic) against the tested bacteria and fungi. the n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against candida albicans (mic=25 mug/ml), candida tropicalis (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and cryptococcus neoformans, (mic=15.5 mug/ml). from the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of schinus lentiscifolius. conclusion: the antimicrobial activity and some constituents of schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. the results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.

TI  == microbiological assessment of indoor air of a teaching hospital in nigeria.
AB  == objective: to investigate the quality of indoor air of different wards and units  of olabisi onabanjo university teaching hospital, sagamu, to ascertain their contribution to infection rate in the hospital. methods: the microbial quality of indoor air of nine wards/units of olabisi onabanjo university teaching hospital,  sagamu, nigeria was conducted. sedimentation technique using open petri-dishes containing different culture media was employed and samplings were done twice daily, one in the morning shortly after cleaning and before influx of people/patients into the wards/units and the other in the evening when a lot of activities would have taken place in these wards. isolates were identified according to standard methods. results: results showed that there was a statistically significant difference (chi(2) = 6.016 7) in the bacteria population of the different sampling time whereas it was not so for fungi population (chi(2) = 0.285 7). male medical ward (mmw) and male surgical general  (msg) recorded the highest bacterial and fungal growth while the operating theatre (ot) was almost free of microbial burden. the bacteria isolates were staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella sp., bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes and serratia marscences while the fungi isolates included  aspergillus flavus, penicillium sp., fusarium sp., candida albicans and alternaria sp. staphylococcus aureus was the predominantly isolated bacterium while penicillium sp. was the most isolated fungus. conclusions: though most of the microbial isolates were potential and or opportunistic pathogens, there was no correlation between the isolates in this study and the surveillance report of  nosocomial infection during the period of study, hence the contribution of the indoor air cannot be established. from the reduction noticed in the morning samples, stringent measures such as proper disinfection and regular cleaning, restriction of patient relatives' movement in and out of the wards/units need to  be enforced so as to improve the quality of indoor air of our hospital wards/units.

TI  == antimicrobial efficacy of achillea ligustica all. (asteraceae) essential oils against reference and isolated oral microorganisms.
AB  == the aim of this study was to verify the effectiveness of achillea ligustica essential oils against several oral microorganisms in comparison with a commercial essential oil-containing mouthrinse (listerine((r))) and clove oil (containing 89% eugenol). the inhibition efficacy of a. ligustica essential oils  alone and in combination with listerine((r)) was evaluated by the micro-dilution  method. the most susceptible microorganisms were bacillus cereus, streptococcus pyogenes, and candida albicans. the efficacy was similar to that of the clove oil. the antiseptic mouthwash listerine((r)) did not exert a strong inhibition on microbial strains tested, whereas its effectiveness increased significantly when  essential oil was added. the study provides additional evidence for the in vitro  inhibitory activity of a. ligustica essential oils on several pathogens, suggesting their usefulness in mouthrinse formulations as an adjunct to mechanical oral hygiene regimens. essential oil-containing mouthrinses can be beneficial, safe components of daily oral health routines, representing an efficient and without side effect alternative to prevent and control oral infections.

TI  == antibacterial properties of a glycolipid-rich extract and active principle from nunavik collections of the macroalgae fucus evanescens c. agardh (fucaceae).
AB  == this study investigated the antibacterial activity of glycolipid-rich extracts of the brown macroalga fucus evanescens in cell culture. accessions were collected on the arctic coast of ungava bay, nunavik, quebec. the crude ethyl acetate extract of these accessions showed strong antibacterial activity (>/=4 log(10) cfu) against hemophilus influenzae , legionella pneumophila , propionibacterium acnes (atcc and clinical isolate), and streptococcus pyogenes at 100 microg/ml. this algal extract inhibited by 3 log(10) clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus , whereas bacillus cereus , escherichia coli , klebsiella pneumoniae , and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not significantly affected. further investigations of the activity of a glycolipid-rich fraction, extracted with dichloromethane, against propionibacterium acnes showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml, with an inhibition of more than 99% at only 7.8 microg/ml. the main active compound, a beta-d-galactosyl o-linked glycolipid, was synthesized for the bioassay and showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml but lost its activity more quickly with only 50% of inhibition at 12.5 microg/ml. therefore, the semipurified f. evanescens extract could be a good choice for future research into the development of alternative treatments for acne therapy.

TI  == antibacterial activity of different honeys against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == to study the antimicrobial activity of honey, 60 samples of various botanical origin were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities against 16 clinical pathogens and their respective reference strains. the microbiological quality of  honeys and the antibiotic susceptibility of the various isolates were also examined. the bioassay applied for determining the antimicrobial effect employs the well-agar diffusion method and the estimation of minimum active dilution which produces a 1mm diameter inhibition zone. all honey samples, despite their origin (coniferous, citrus, thyme or polyfloral), showed antibacterial activity against the pathogenic and their respective reference strains at variable levels. coniferous and thyme honeys showed the highest activity with an average minimum dilution of 17.4 and 19.2% (w/v) followed by citrus and polyfloral honeys with 20.8 and 23.8% respectively. clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus and bacillus subtilis were proven to be up to 60% more  resistant than their equal reference strains thus emphasizing the variability in  the antibacterial effect of honey and the need for further research.

TI  == autocatalytic intramolecular isopeptide bond formation in gram-positive bacterial pili: a qm/mm simulation.
AB  == many gram-positive pathogens possess external pili or fimbriae with which they adhere to host cells during the infection process. unusual dual intramolecular isopeptide bonds between asn and lys side chains within the n-terminal and c-terminal domains of the pilus subunits have been observed initially in the streptococcus pyogenes pilin subunit spy0128 and subsequently in gbs52 from streptococcus agalactiae, in the bcpa major pilin of bacillus cereus and in the rrgb pilin of streptococcus pneumoniae, among others. within each pilin subunit,  intramolecular isopeptide bonds serve to stabilize the protein. these bonds provide a means to withstand large external mechanical forces, as well as possibly assisting in supporting a conformation favored for pilin subunit polymerization via sortase transpeptidases. genome-wide analyses of pili-containing gram-positive bacteria are known or suspected to contain isopeptide bonds in pilin subunits. for the autocatalytic formation of isopeptide cross-links, a conservation of three amino acids including asn, lys, and a catalytically important acidic glu (or asp) residue are responsible. however, the chemical mechanism of how isopeptide bonds form within pilin remains poorly understood. although it is possible that several mechanistic paths could lead to  isopeptide bond formation in pili, the requirement of a conserved glutamate and highly organized positioning of residues within the hydrophobic environment of the active site were found in numerous pilin crystal structures such as spy0128 and rrgb. this suggests a mechanism involving direct coupling of lysine side chain amine to the asparagine carboxamide mediated by critical acid/base or hydrogen bonding interactions with the catalytic glutamate residue. from this mechanistic perspective, we used the qm/mm minimum free-energy path method to examine the reaction details of forming the isopeptide bonds with spy0128 as a model pilin, specifically focusing on the role of the glutamate in catalysis. it  was determined that the reaction mechanism likely consists of two major steps: the nucleophilic attack on cgamma by nitrogen in the unprotonated lys epsilon-amino group and, then two concerted proton transfers occur during the formation of the intramolecular isopeptide bond to subsequently release ammonia.  more importantly, within the dual active sites of spy0128, glu(117), and glu(258) residues function as crucial catalysts for each isopeptide bond formation, respectively, by relaying two proton transfers. this work also suggests that domain-domain interactions within spy0128 may modulate the reactivity of residues within each active site. our results may hopefully shed light on the molecular mechanisms of pilin biogenesis in gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == antioxidant, antibacterial and antigiardial activities of walsura robusta roxb.
AB  == walsura robusta roxb. (family: meliaceae) is a well-known multi-purpose medicinal plant, and has been employed for a wide range of disease conditions without documented scientific data. in the current study, four pure isolated compounds, 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl beta-d-glucopyranoside (1), turpinionoside a (2), (+)-lyoniresinol 3alpha-o-beta-d-glucopyranoside (3) and (-)-lyoniresinol 3alpha-o-beta-d-glucopyranoside (4), were isolated from the leaves and twigs of w. robusta. biological evaluation for free radical scavenging, antibacterial and  antigiardial activities was performed. we investigated antioxidant effects of the crude extracts as well as the isolated compounds using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (dpph), hydroxyl radical (oh), and superoxide anion (o(2)) scavenging assays. three phenolic glucosides (1, 3 and 4) were found to possess strong antioxidant activity. they scavenged dpph(*) with ic(50) values in the range of 51.5-86.6 microm. we also detected the superoxide dismutase-like activities in compounds 3 and 4 which are lignan glucosides, demonstrating potent superoxide scavenging activity with ic(50) values in the range of 0.8 and 0.7 microm, respectively. other biological activities including  antibacterial and antigiardial assays were carried out. preliminary results demonstrated that most extracts, except the diethyl ether extract, exhibited inhibition zones against all gram-positive bacteria including bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, and s. pyogenes. aqueous extracts of this plant species could inhibit gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria such as escherichia coli, salmonella typhi and shigella sonnei. however, the determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of w. robusta on all tested bacterial strains  showed only weak activity, and their mbcs were greater than 25 mg ml(-1). for antigiardial activity, incubation with 2 x 10(5) trophozoites ml(-1) of the culture medium with the crude extracts at concentration ranged from 31.25 to 1000 microg ml(-1) demonstrated no activity (mic > 1000 microg ml(-1)).

TI  == single chain variable fragment antibodies selected by phage display against the sporozoite surface antigen s16 of cryptosporidium parvum.
AB  == two human single chain variable fragment (scfv) libraries were used to select clones that bound to the surface glycoprotein s16 of cryptosporidium parvum. panning of the tomlinson libraries i and j resulted in the isolation of nine distinct clones. of the four clones which had full-length scfv, three contained stop codons. the remaining five clones were truncated, with four missing the heavy chain, and one missing most of the light chain. the full-length clones exhibited better binding to native c. parvum proteins and recombinant s16 than the truncated clones, with the exception of one truncated clone. none of the selected clones cross-reacted with giardia lamblia, escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus or another immunogenic target of c. parvum, p23. clones expressed as the soluble scfv-giiip  construct were able to detect c. parvum native proteins and sporozoites. panning  from naive libraries was an useful method for isolation and identification of recombinant antibodies that have the potential for use in pathogen detection and  immunotherapy.

TI  == [myonecrosis in users of injecting drugs (a clinical case)].
AB  == myonecrosis remains one of the severest manifestations of skin and soft tissue infections. clostridia (c. perfringens, c. novyi, c. septicum, c. sordellii, c. histolyticum) are dominant and staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and bacteriodes fragilis are much less in the etiology of myonecrosis. cases of gas gangrene have recently become more frequent among injection drug users all over the world. russia has become the largest opiate market in europe and consumption of these narcotic drugs is annually growing. in  the russian federation, a larger number of injection drug users uniquely results  in a rise of cases of clostridium- and mixed flora-induced myonecrosis. gas gangrene in hiv-positive drug abusers seems to rapidly progress to multiple organ failure and to show high death rates, rather than to develop a localized form. the analyzed case of mixed flora-induced gas gangrene is of interest to physicians of any specialties who can encounter this wound infection in hiv-positive patients.

TI  == the corynebacterium diphtheriae shaft pilin spaa is built of tandem ig-like modules with stabilizing isopeptide and disulfide bonds.
AB  == cell-surface pili are important virulence factors that enable bacterial pathogens to adhere to specific host tissues and modulate host immune response. relatively  little is known about the structure of gram-positive bacterial pili, which are built by the sortase-catalyzed covalent crosslinking of individual pilin proteins. here we report the 1.6-a resolution crystal structure of the shaft pilin component spaa from corynebacterium diphtheriae, revealing both common and  unique features. the spaa pilin comprises 3 tandem ig-like domains, with characteristic folds related to those typically found in non-pilus adhesins. whereas both the middle and the c-terminal domains contain an intramolecular lys-asn isopeptide bond, previously detected in the shaft pilins of streptococcus pyogenes and bacillus cereus, the middle ig-like domain also harbors a calcium ion, and the c-terminal domain contains a disulfide bond. by mass spectrometry, we show that the spaa monomers are cross-linked in the assembled pili by a lys-thr isopeptide bond, as predicted by previous genetic studies. together, our  results reveal that despite profound dissimilarities in primary sequences, the shaft pilins of gram-positive pathogens have strikingly similar tertiary structures, suggesting a modular backbone construction, including stabilizing intermolecular and intramolecular isopeptide bonds.

TI  == mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  == the crude extract and the hexane, ch(2)cl(2), etoac, n-buoh, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of leishmania (l. chagasi and l. amazonensis),  11 strains of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica sorovar tythimurium, shigella sonnei, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus pyogenes and bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (candida albicans and  cryptococcus neoformans). the antioxidant activity (dpph radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. all samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. s. sonnei, b. cereus and c. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-buoh and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. the lowest mic was recorded for the ch(2)cl(2) fraction against c. neoformans (mic of 10 microg/ml), followed by b. cereus, s. sonnei, and e. cloacae (mic of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). the ch(2)cl(2) fraction was the most effective against l. chagasi (ic(50) of 6.7  microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against  l. amazonensis (ic(50) of 9 microg/ml). a cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and ch(2)cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. these results suggest that m. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.

TI  == single-chain variable fragment antibodies selected by phage display against the sporozoite surface antigen p23 of cryptosporidium parvum.
AB  == cryptosporidium parvum, an apicomplexan parasite transmitted via animal fecal wastes, is the causative agent of cryptosporidiosis. clones were selected from 2  synthetic naive human single-chain variable fragment (scfv) phagemid libraries that bound to the recombinant p23 protein of c. parvum. panning the tomlinson i and j phagemid libraries resulted in 6 distinct clones. two clones had full-length scfv sequences, while the remaining clones were either truncated or missing a section of the heavy chain. despite these differences, all clones were  able to detect both native c. parvum proteins and recombinant p23. none of the selected clones cross-reacted with escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, giardia lamblia (cysts or trophozoites), or with s16, another dominant surface antigen on c. parvum sporozoites. clones expressed as the scfv-giiip fusion construct in soluble form detected c. parvum.  panning from naive libraries is a useful method for isolation and identification  of recombinant antibodies that have the potential for use in pathogen detection and immunotherapy.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == the impact of homologous recombination on the generation of diversity in bacteria.
AB  == the imprint of demographic and selective processes on bacterial population structure needs to be evaluated as deviation from the expectations of an appropriate null neutral model. we explore the impact of varying the population mutation and recombination rates theta and rho on ideal populations, using a recently developed model of neutral drift at multiple loci. this model may be fitted to experimental data to provide estimates of these parameters, and we do so for seven bacterial species (neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, helicobacter pylori, burkholderia  pseudomallei and bacillus cereus), illustrating that bacterial species vary extensively in these fundamental parameters. historically, the influence of recombination has often been estimated through its influence on the index of association i(a). we show that this may be relatively insensitive to changes in either mutation or recombination rates. it is known that biased sampling can lead to artificially high estimates of i(a). we therefore provide a method of precisely separating the effects of such bias and true linkage between alleles. we also demonstrate that by fitting the neutral model to experimental data, more  informative and precise estimates of the relative roles of recombination and mutation may be obtained.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  == a rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. nylon membrane was used as the array support. a mutation region of the 23s rrna gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. a pair of universal primers was designed for pcr amplification of the 23s rrna gene. twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. the 23s rrna gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, shigella dysenteriae, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, proteus vulgaris, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. two other species (salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with e. coli, but  the reaction did not affect their detection. after redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with staphylococcus aureus, but not  with clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pyogenes. the oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne  infections. the superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  == the ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. these pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. these infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer  generations of antibiotics. in this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis  and endophthalmitis. the ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis. mic90 values for the drugs  against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/ml to 0.57 mg/ml and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. the mic90 for gatifloxacin against streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/ml compared with 0.73 mg/ml for moxifloxacin (p = .011). among the gram-negative isolates, the mean mic90 for gatifloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/ml compared with 2.60 mg/ ml for moxifloxacin (p = .023).  mic90 values for gatifloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. for the atypicals, the mic90 values for gatifloxacin against nocardia asteroides and mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.

AB  == we developed a new molecular tool based on rpob gene (encoding the beta subunit of rna polymerase) sequencing to identify streptococci. we first sequenced the complete rpob gene for streptococcus anginosus, s. equinus, and abiotrophia defectiva. sequences were aligned with these of s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. pneumoniae available in genbank. using an in-house analysis program (svarap),  we identified a 740-bp variable region surrounded by conserved, 20-bp zones and,  by using these conserved zones as pcr primer targets, we amplified and sequenced  this variable region in an additional 30 streptococcus, enterococcus, gemella, granulicatella, and abiotrophia species. this region exhibited 71.2 to 99.3% interspecies homology. we therefore applied our identification system by pcr amplification and sequencing to a collection of 102 streptococci and 60 bacterial isolates belonging to other genera. amplicons were obtained in streptococci and bacillus cereus, and sequencing allowed us to make a correct identification of streptococci. molecular signatures were determined for the discrimination of closely related species within the s. pneumoniae-s. oralis-s. mitis group and the s. agalactiae-s. difficile group. these signatures allowed us to design a s. pneumoniae-specific pcr and sequencing primer pair.

TI  == vitreous and aqueous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  == objective: to investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous and aqueous humor after oral administration. methods: a prospective, nonrandomized study of 24 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy between september 2001 and may 2002 at the cullen eye institute. aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 24 patients  after administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before the operation. assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. results: mean +/- sd gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 23), vitreous (n = 23), and aqueous (n = 11) were 5.14 +/- 1.36 micro g/ml, 1.34  +/- 0.34 micro g/ml, and 1.08 +/- 0.54 micro g/ml respectively. mean +/- sd sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 3.2 +/- 1.0 hours, 4.0 +/- 1.0 hours, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. the percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration  achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 26.17% and 21.02%, respectively. mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous mic(90 ) levels were achieved against many pathogens, including staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. conclusions: orally administered gatifloxacin achieves therapeutic levels in the noninflamed human eye, and the activity spectrum appropriately encompass the bacterial species most frequently involved in the various causes of endophthalmitis. because of its broad-spectrum coverage, low mic(90) levels for the organisms of concern, and good tolerability, gatifloxacin  represents a major advance in the prophylaxis or treatment of postoperative, posttraumatic, and bleb-associated bacterial endophthalmitis.

TI  == application of a real-time biosensor to detect bacteria in platelet concentrates.
AB  == a spore-based biosensor for detecting low levels of bacteria in real-time has been recently developed. the system (termed lexsas, label-free exponential signal-amplification system) exploits spore's ability to produce fluorescence when sensing neighboring bacterial cells. we studied the lexsas as a possible approach for identifying bacterially contaminated platelet concentrates prior to  transfusion because the system offers rapid analysis, high sensitivity, and low cost. if successful, this approach could reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality from transfusion-related bacteremia and sepsis. in this study, we used  the lexsas for detecting bacteria in platelet concentrates spiked with bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, or streptococcus pyogenes. bacteria were separated from platelets using a 2-min procedure based on bacterial resistance to detergents and osmotic shock. the results indicate that the lexsas could be used to design a practical biosensor for identifying bacterially contaminated platelets in real-time.

AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

TI  == thuricin 7: a novel bacteriocin produced by bacillus thuringiensis bmg1.7, a new  strain isolated from soil.
AB  == aims: detection and identification of new antagonistic activities towards bacillus cereus and relatives. methods and results: twenty bacillus thuringiensis strains were screened for their capacity to express bacteriocin-like agents. strain bmg1.7, isolated from soil, showed an antagonistic activity called thuricin 7. thuricin 7 was active against several species of the genus bacillus,  including three of the four known b. thuringiensis/b. cereus bacteriocin producers, as well as against streptococcus pyogenes and listeria monocytogenes strains. antimicrobial activity was lost after treatment with proteinase k. the active protein had an apparent molecular weight of 11.6 kda, and was secreted at  the end of the exponential growth phase. thuricin 7 retained 55% of the activity  after incubation at 98 degrees c for 30 min. the mode of action of thuricin 7 was shown to be bactericidal and bacteriolytic. conclusion: thuricin 7 is a novel bacteriocin produced by a newly isolated bacillus thuringiensis strain bmg1.7. significance and impact of the study: the characteristics of thuricin 7 indicate  that it is a new bacteriocin which may have interesting biotechnological applications due to its relatively large activity spectrum.

TI  == antibacterial activity of orobanche cernua extract.
AB  == the effect of the parasitic plant orobanche cernua extract was evaluated on 5 different gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. dilution experiments show that the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic; microgram/ml) of the extract was  as follows: staphylococcus aureus-1526.5; streptococcus sp.-3125; streptococcus pyogenes-25,000 and both for bacillus cereus and escherichia coli-50,000 micrograms/ml. data indicated that the mic of 3125 micrograms/ml is equal to cefotaxime (30 micrograms) and tobromycin (10 micrograms) activity against streptococcus sp. and s. aureus, respectively; 25,000 and 50,000 micrograms/ml is equal to cefotaxime (30 micrograms) activity against s. pyogenes and b. cereus, respectively, and 50,000 micrograms/ml is equal to nalidixic acid (30 micrograms) activity against e. coli. it can be concluded that the o. cernua extract displays remarkable activity against some gram-positive bacteria such as streptococcus and staphylococcus.

TI  == antimicrobial effects of propolis extracts on escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus strains resistant to various antibiotics and some microorganisms.
AB  == abstract propolis is collected by worker honey bees from the trees. the bees pack propolis on their hind legs, carry it to their colony, and use it as a sterilant  in the hive. propolis has also been used by humans since early times for various  purposes and, especially, as a medicine because of its antimicrobial properties.  in this study, antimicrobial effects of propolis samples on three escherichia coli and two staphylococcus aureus strains that are multiresistant to antibiotics and on salmonella typhimurium, bruceila abortus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, candida tropicalis, and aspergillus niger were studied. propolis extracts were prepared with acetone and dimethyl sulfoxide (dmso). at concentrations of 10 and 25 ml, propolis extracts affected all of the  microorganisms in acetone and dmso in concentrations of 10.0, 50.0, and 100.0 ppm. the results detected in this in vitro study provided evidence that propolis  may be used as an antimicrobial agent against many microorganisms.

TI  == evaluation of swirling, ph, and glucose tests for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: although infrequent, episodes of transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis may lead to serious outcomes or death and therefore are of concern. this study evaluates the sensitivity of three surrogate tests for the presence of bacteria in platelet concentrates: cessation of swirling, low extracellular ph, and low plasma glucose levels. study design and methods: day 0 platelet concentrates were inoculated with low levels of one of seven bacterial strains and stored with agitation at 20 to 24 degrees c for up to 5 days. in the morning  and afternoon of each day of storage, bacterial levels were ascertained by quantitative plate culture, and platelet concentrates were tested for platelet ph, plasma glucose, and swirling. quantitative and semiquantitative dipstick techniques were used to determine ph and glucose levels. results: platelet concentrates had attained stationary phase growth of streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus mitis, or staphylococcus epidermidis (> or = 10(7) -10(8) colony-forming units [cfu]/ml) before either the swirling or dipstick methods suggested the presence of bacteria. the sensitivity of swirling and glucose tests for detecting bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates was generally comparable. although the sensitivity of the ph test was generally similar to that of swirling and glucose tests for most bacteria, platelet concentrates contaminated with e. cloacae had normal ph despite the presence of high levels of bacteria (> or = 10(7)-10(8) cfu/ml). conclusion: the sensitivity in detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates by the swirling technique or by measuring extracellular ph or plasma glucose is less than the sensitivity reported for microscopy with gram stain (10(5)-10(6) cfu/ml), fluorescence microscopy with acridine orange stain (10(4)-10(5) cfu/ml), chemiluminescence detection of ribosomal rna (10(3)-10(4) cfu/ml), and automated bacterial culture (1 cfu/sample volume).

TI  == antibacterial and molluscicidal phenolic acids from spondias mombin.
AB  == spondias mombin l. (anacardiaceae), used in traditional medicine because of its antimicrobial properties, was found to contain a series of 6-alkenyl-salicylic acids. they were isolated from the ethanolic extract of leaves and stems of spondias mombin by a combination of chromatographic methods. their structure was  determined by nmr and ms techniques as (17:3), (17:2) and (17:1) pelandjuaic acid [or 6-(8'z,11'z,14'z-heptadecatrienyl)-salicylic acid, 6-(8'z,11'z-heptadecadienyl)-salicylic acid, and 6-(10'z-heptadecenyl)-salicylic  acid, respectively], 6-(12'z-non-adecenyl)-salicylic acid, and 6-(15'z-heneicosenyl)-salicylic acid, the two last compounds being new ones. these phenolic acids were shown to have a pronounced antibacterial effect against bacillus cereus, streptococcus pyogenes, and mycobacterium fortuitum (minimal bactericidal concentration in a concentration range of 3-25 micrograms/ml), and a molluscicidal effect against the snail biomphalaria glabrata, an intermediate host in the schistosome life cycle. because of their high molluscicidal activity  (lc90 down to 1-3 ppm), these long-chain salicylic acid derivatives may be important tools in the prevention of schistosomiasis.

TI  == in vitro activity of ly264826, a new glycopeptide antibiotic, against gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients with cancer.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ly264826, a novel glycopeptide antibiotic produced by amycolatopsis orientalis, was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and oxacillin against 311 gram-positive clinical isolates from patients with cancer,  ly264826 had lower mics for 90% of isolates (mic90) than vancomycin for all species tested. it was active against oxacillin-resistant isolates including staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), staphylococcus haemolyticus (mic90, 2.0 micrograms/ml), enterococcus spp. (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), bacillus cereus (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml), and corynebacterium jeikeium (mic90, 0.12 micrograms/ml). for s. aureus, including oxacillin-resistant isolates, the mics of ly264826 were similar to those of teicoplanin. for coagulase-negative staphylococci, however, ly264826 had mics that were 4- to 32-fold lower than those of teicoplanin. against most streptococcal species the activities of ly264826 and teicoplanin were similar. bactericidal activity against staphylococcus spp. and most streptococcus pyogenes isolates was less than or equal to 1 dilution of the mic. one isolate of s. pyogenes and all enterococcus faecalis strains tested were tolerant of ly264826, with mbcs greater than or equal to 32-fold greater than the mics. the addition of 50% human serum resulted  in a significant increase in activity only against staphylococcus epidermidis. variations in ph from 6.4 to 8.4 and in inoculum from 10(3) to 10(7) cfu/ml did not significantly affect the activity of ly264826.

TI  == cloning of a gene encoding a major secreted polypeptide of listeria monocytogenes and its potential use as a species-specific probe.
AB  == a gene, designated msp, that encodes a major secreted polypeptide with a molecular mass of approximately 60 kilodaltons (kda) was cloned from listeria monocytogenes 10403. dna hybridization analysis indicated that the msp gene was highly conserved among 15 independent l. monocytogenes isolates and that each of  5 isolates tested secreted a 60-kda polypeptide that was immunologically related  to the msp gene product. dna sequences related to msp were not detected in any other listeria species or in strains of bacillus cereus, bacillus thuringiensis,  streptococcus pyogenes, or streptococcus pneumoniae when standard stringent dna hybridization conditions were used. under nonstringent conditions, related sequences were detected in listeria ivanovii, listeria seeligeri, and listeria innocua, and immunoblot analysis indicated that these strains secreted polypeptides of about 60 kda that were immunologically related to the msp gene product. the possibility of using the msp gene as a probe for the detection of l. monocytogenes and the potential functions of the msp gene product are discussed.

TI  == detection of bacterial cell wall hydrolases after denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  == cell walls from various gram-positive bacteria were incorporated at a concentration of 0.2% (w/v) into polyacrylamide gels as a substrate for detection of cell wall hydrolases. bacterial extracts from crude cell wall preparations were denatured with sodium dodecyl sulfate and 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in gels containing bacterial cell walls. after renaturation in the presence of purified and buffered 1% (v/v) triton x-100, cell wall hydrolases were visualized as clear lytic zones against the opaque cell wall background. one to fifteen bands with lytic activity could be detected, depending on bacterial extracts and on the nature of the cell walls  incorporated into gels. crude cell wall extracts were the best source of cell wall hydrolases from various gram-positive bacteria such as clostridium perfringens (15 bands), micrococcus luteus (1 band), bacillus megaterium (4 bands), bacillus sp. (6 bands), b. cereus (3 bands), b. subtilis (7 bands), staphylococcus aureus (13 bands), streptococcus faecalis (3 bands), and strep. pyogenes (5 bands). molecular masses of cell wall hydrolases ranged from 17 to 114.6 kda. lytic activities against cell walls of corynebacterium sepedonicum (clavibacter michiganense pv. sepedonicum) could be shown with the cell wall extracts of strep. pyogenes (45.7 kda), strep. faecalis (67 kda), b. megaterium (67 kda), and staph. aureus (67 kda).

TI  == [antibacterial spectrum of lisosubtilin g10x].
AB  == data on the antibacterial spectrum of lysosubtilin g10x, a preparation of lytic enzymes from bacillus subtilis sk-52 are presented. lysosubtilin was active against grampositive and gramnegative pathogenic bacteria. when it was used as a  substrate of live lyophilized microbial cells the highest lysis levels were observed in b. brevis, b. cereus, b. pumilis, b. subtilis and s. faecalis. preincubation of the substrate in acid media mainly increased the levels of the lysis by enzyme preparation. sometimes the increase was very high (b. sphaericus, b. subtilis 720, e. coli k12 and mre-600). such a preincubation provided cell lysis in some strains not liable to the effect of lysosubtilin (b. cereus 1312, c. renale, m. luteus, s. aureus kp, 800, 805 and 126001, s. pyogenes 291). an increase in the lysosubtilin concentration in the reaction mixture in the majority of the cases did not provide favourable results. however, some strains resistant to the preparation at a concentration of 1000 units/ml were lysed with  its 10 times higher doses. an increase in the lysis level was also achieved with  increasing the time of the incubation with the enzyme preparation. proceeding from the preparation antibacterial spectrum it is possible to recommend it for treatment of diseases in agricultural animals. its use in veterinary was a success.

AB  == the aerobic bacteria colonizing breast milk of the low-income group in nigeria were quantified to assess its suitability for use in milk banks. in parallel, the nutritional and health status of donating mothers and their infants were assessed by physicians. the aerobic bacteria contained in the specimens included streptococcus salivarius, bacillus cereus, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermides. in general, the microbial load found in these milk samples is lower than levels considered dangerous. an analysis of the results showed that 50% of the mother's milk is contaminated, 17% of which was infected with primary pathogens. there was no correlation between demographic data, nutritional or health status of either mother or infant and microbial load  in mother's milk. milk obtained from this socio-economic group, is therefore, considered safe for use in milk banks.

TI  == cloning and expression in escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis of the hemolysin (cereolysin) determinant from bacillus cereus.
AB  == from a cosmid gene bank of bacillus cereus gp4 in escherichia coli we isolated clones which, after several days of incubation, formed hemolysis zones on erythrocyte agar plates. these clones contained recombinant cosmids with b. cereus dna insertions of varying lengths which shared some common restriction fragments. the smallest insertion was recloned as a psti fragment into pjkk3-1, a shuttle vector which replicates in bacillus subtilis and e. coli. when this recombinant plasmid (pjkk3-1 hly-1) was transformed into e. coli, it caused hemolysis on erythrocyte agar plates, but in liquid assays no external or internal hemolytic activity could be detected with the e. coli transformants. b.  subtilis carrying the same plasmid exhibited hemolytic activity at levels comparable to those of the b. cereus donor strain. the hemolysin produced in b. subtilis seemed to be indistinguishable from cereolysin in its sensitivity to cholesterol, activation by dithiothreitol, and inactivation by antibodies raised  against cereolysin. when the recombinant dna carrying the cereolysin gene was used as a probe in hybridization experiments with chromosomal dna from a streptolysin o-producing strain of streptococcus pyogenes or from listeriolysin-producing strains of listeria monocytogenes, no positive hybridization signals were obtained. these data suggest that the genes for these  three sh-activated cytolysins do not have extended sequence homology.

TI  == survival of cultured cells after functional and structural disorganization of plasma membrane by bacterial haemolysins and phospholipases.
AB  == lesions were induced in the plasma membranes of cultured human fibroblasts by membrane damaging toxins of bacterial origin (haemolysins). structural disorganization of the membrane was measured as leakage of a radiolabelled small  cytoplasmic marker and functional membrane damage was measured as decreased uptake of aminoisobutyrate. cell survival was scored 24 and 48 hr later by measuring uptake of trypan blue and by light microscopical evaluation of cell morphology and proliferation. the membrane damage induced by most bacterial toxins was reversible upon removal of the toxin, since toxin-treated cells recovered and excluded trypan blue although they had been permeable to the dye immediately after the toxin treatment. among ten bacterial toxins tested, the only exception of this general behavior was the aeromonas hydrophila beta-haemolysin, which irreversibly damaged human fibroblasts. thus, the action of bacterial haemolysins on cultured cells generally seems restricted to a plasma membrane permeabilization, which is reversible regardless of the mechanism of membrane damaging action of the toxin or of the relative size of the structural lesions induced. furthermore, the use of trypan blue uptake as a measure of cell  death caused by membrane damaging agents appears to be of limited value.

TI  == gram-positive bacteria-induced granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis in rabbits.
AB  == pneumococci have been shown to induce granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis  which might contribute to morbidity and mortality in pneumococcal sepsis. we studied whether other gram-positive species (groups a and b streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and clostridium perfringens) could also induce these phenomena. rabbits were challenged with nonviable preparations of each species, and all five species induced profound granulocytopenia (mean decrease of 90%) and pulmonary leukostasis. in vitro studies of serum incubated with these species of bacteria showed a mean consumption of total hemolytic complement of 90%, a mean increase of chemotactic activity for granulocytes of 204%, and a mean augmentation of granulocyte adherence of 45% (compared with 18%  for the control). infusion of sonicate-exposed sera induced granulocytopenia in recipient rabbits. thus, several nonviable gram-positive species can interact with serum to activate the complement system, generate c5a bioactivity, augment granulocyte adherence, and generate a neutropenia-inducing factor. these alterations may contribute to granulocytopenia or pulmonary leukostasis, which may play a role in the morbidity and mortality associated with gram-positive bacterial infections.
