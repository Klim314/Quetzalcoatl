TI  - Molecular cloning and functional characterization of fumarases C in Neisseria species.
AB  - Fumarase is one of the key enzymes in the TCA cycle and has been implicated in virulence and survival of some microorganisms under suboptimal environmental conditions. In this study, the fumC genes that encode fumarase C (FUMCs) from Neisseria meningitidis, N. gonorrhoeae and N. subflava were identified by homology-based analysis, cloned by polymerase chain reactions and fully sequenced. The inferred primary sequence of neisserial FUMCs showed a high degree of conservation with 97.8-98.7% amino acid identity. However, phylogenetic analysis revealed that these neisserial FUMCs are divergent from class II fumarases found in other microorganisms, rat and human. The putative fumC genes were subcloned into the expression vector, pGEX-6P-1 and efficiently expressed in Esherichia coli BL21. The purified recombinant fusion proteins obtained by affinity chromatography demonstrated high catalytic activities (120-180 U/mg), thus authenticating the identities and functionalities of the cloned genes. Whether FUMC has any physiological relevance to the pathogenesisity of Neisseriae must await future gene disruption or mutagenesis studies.
TI  - Functional diversity of three different DsbA proteins from Neisseria meningitidis.
AB  - The genome of Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B strain MC58 contains three genes - nmb0278, nmb0294 and nmb0407 - encoding putative homologues of DsbA, a periplasmic thiol disulphide oxidoreductase protein-folding catalyst of the Dsb protein family. DsbA assists the folding of periplasmic and membrane proteins in diverse organisms. While all three cloned genes complemented the DTT sensitivity of dsbA-null Escherichia coli, they showed different activities in folding specific target proteins in this background. NMB0278 protein was the most active in complementing defects in motility and alkaline phosphatase activity, while NMB0294 was the most active in folding periplasmic MalF. NMB0407 showed the weakest activity in all assays. It is extremely unusual for organisms to contain more than one chromosomal dsbA. Among the members of the genus Neisseria, only the meningococcus carries all three of these genes. Strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria lactamica, Neisseria cinerea and Neisseria polysaccharea contained only homologues of nmb0278 and nmb0407, while Neisseria flava, Neisseria subflava and Neisseria flavescens carried only nmb0294. It is speculated that the versatility of the meningococcus in surviving in different colonizing and invasive disease settings may be derived in part from an enhanced potential to deploy outer-membrane proteins, a consequence of carrying an extended repertoire of protein-folding catalysts.
TI  - Selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. METHODS: A gradient plate technique was used to expose Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Neisseria subflava, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Prevotella nigrescens, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans and Veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations of triclosan. Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 was included as an organism showing the triclosan resistance development trait. MIC values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. RESULTS: N. subflava, Pr. nigrescens Po. gingivalis and E. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (MIC range 0.1-3.9 mg/L), whereas the lactobacillus and S. mutans were less susceptible (MIC range 15.6-20.8 mg/L). Triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (P < 0.01) for the positive control E. coli, although its MICs towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. Minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (MIC) occurred for Pr. nigrescens and in S. sanguis and S. oralis (MBC). Mean changes in susceptibilities (MIC and MBC) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine MBCs for S. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. CONCLUSIONS: These data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for E. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. Other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than FabI that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.
TI  - The integration site of the iga gene in commensal Neisseria sp.
AB  - An IgA1 protease is produced by the human pathogens Neisseria gonorrhoeae and N.  meningitidis but not by related non-pathogenic, commensal, Neisseria species. In this study, the chromosomal iga locus was characterized in the N. gonorrhoeae strain MS11 and compared to corresponding loci in N. meningitidis and commensal Neisseria species. In N. gonorrhoeae, the genes trpB and ksgA were found immediately downstream of iga. In addition to comL and comA, a homolog of the Escherichia coli YFII gene was identified upstream of iga. Each gene in the iga region (YFII and comL, comA and iga, and trpB and ksgA) is transcribed in the opposite direction to its neighbors. The comL/ comA and iga/ trpB pairs each have a transcriptional terminator in the correct position for joint use. These terminators contain the common gonococcal DNA uptake sequence (DUS). A highly conserved direct repeat of 25 bp located immediately adjacent to the iga gene in N. gonorrhoeae was also found in N. meningitidis. In Southern hybridization experiments, no homology to iga was detectable in the chromosomal DNAs of the commensal species N. mucosa, N. lactamica, N. flavescens, N. cinerea, N. subflava, N. flava, N. sicca or N. elongata. When N. gonorrhoeae comL and trpB were used as probes, signals were detected on the same restriction fragment in six of the eight species. This indicated that commensal Neisseria species share a possible integration site for the iga gene between comA and trpB. The region between comA and trpB was therefore amplified by PCR. The fragment obtained from N. lactamica showed a high degree of homology to gonococcal comA and trpB, respectively, but iga was replaced by a sequence of 13 bp that shows no homology to any known gonococcal sequence. Our data suggest that iga was acquired by a common ancestor of N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis rather than being distributed by horizontal gene transfer. N. lactamica, which is more closely related to N. gonorrhoeae than other commensals, may have lost iga by deletion.
TI  - Degradation of heme in gram-negative bacteria: the product of the hemO gene of Neisseriae is a heme oxygenase.
AB  - A full-length heme oxygenase gene from the gram-negative pathogen Neisseria meningitidis was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Expression of the enzyme yielded soluble catalytically active protein and caused accumulation of biliverdin within the E. coli cells. The purified HemO forms a 1:1 complex with heme and has a heme protein spectrum similar to that previously reported for the purified heme oxygenase (HmuO) from the gram-positive pathogen Corynebacterium diphtheriae and for eukaryotic heme oxygenases. The overall sequence identity between HemO and these heme oxygenases is, however, low. In the presence of ascorbate or the human NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase system, the heme-HemO complex is converted to ferric-biliverdin IXalpha and carbon monoxide as the final products. Homologs of the hemO gene were identified and characterized in six commensal Neisseria isolates, Neisseria lactamica, Neisseria subflava, Neisseria flava, Neisseria polysacchareae, Neisseria kochii, and Neisseria cinerea. All HemO orthologs shared between 95 and 98% identity in amino acid sequences with functionally important residues being completely conserved. This is the first heme oxygenase identified in a gram-negative pathogen. The identification of HemO as a heme oxygenase provides further evidence that oxidative cleavage of the heme is the mechanism by which some bacteria acquire iron for further use.
TI  - Binding of N-trifluoroacetyl-derivatized natural glycosphingolipids by uropathogenic Escherichia coli and Neisseria subflava.
AB  - Several neutral glycosphingolipids were hydrogenated and subjected to trifluoroacetylation in trifluoroacetic acid/trifluoroacetic acid anhydride under conditions leading to complete exchange of the N-acetyl groups of GalNAc for N-trifluoroacetyl. The derivatized glycosphingolipids were analyzed for binding by P-fimbriated uropathogenic Escherichia coli, recognizing the globo series of glycolipids (carrying Galalpha1-4Gal). Using E. coli it was shown that a GalNCO-CF3 next to the minimum binding epitope Galalpha1-4Gal did not substantially influence the binding, as did not a trifluoro acetyl group on the ceramide. Exchange of N-acetyl of GalNAc in the receptor active gangliotetraosylceramide, Galbeta1-3GalNAcbeta1-4Galbeta1-4Glcbeta1-1Cer, for N-trifluoroacetyl, did not change the binding of two out of the three strains tested of the bacterium Neisseria subflava. Discussion concerning the binding epitopes of the bacterial adhesins to carbohydrates is based on these results.
TI  - The prevalence of gentamicin 2'-N-acetyltransferase in the Proteeae and its role  in the O-acetylation of peptidoglycan.
AB  - The prevalence of aac(2')-Ia, a gene coding for gentamicin 2'-N-acetyltransferase in Providencia stuartii, among species of the Proteeae was investigated to determine if it is a common resistance factor and whether the correlation observed in P. stuartii between its expression and the levels of peptidoglycan O-acetylation represents a general feature of bacteria producing this form of modified peptidoglycan. An evaluation of the MICs of gentamicin for each of the species of the Proteeae did not reveal any apparent relationship between resistance and the degree of O-acetylation of peptidoglycan. The entire aac(2')-Ia gene was used as a probe in Southern hybridization experiments against genomic DNA from each species of the Proteeae. A sequence with strong homology to aac(2')-Ia was present only in Proteus penneri while weak hybridization was also observed to the restriction digested DNA from Providencia rettgeri. Other bacteria that O-acetylate peptidoglycan were also screened with this probe and a homologous DNA sequence was only found in Neisseria subflava. These data suggest that AAC(2')-Ia may contribute to the O-acetylation of peptidoglycan in P. stuartii, but a more specific enzyme must also be produced for this function.
TI  - Binding of mannan-binding protein to various bacterial pathogens of meningitis.
AB  - Mannan-binding protein (MBP), a calcium-dependent plasma lectin, may play a role  in the innate defence against microorganisms. After binding to carbohydrate structures at the bacterial surface, MBP activates the classical pathway of the complement system. To investigate the binding capacity of MBP to various bacteria associated with meningitis, an assay was developed to study the binding of MBP to bacteria grown in a semisynthetic fluid culture medium. Salmonella montevideo (containing a mannose-rich lipopolysaccharide (LPS)), used as a positive control strain, showed binding of radiolabelled MBP at a level of 80% compared with binding of MBP to zymosan. Binding of labelled MBP to Salm. montevideo was time-dependent, temperature-dependent and saturable. The binding was inhibited by unlabelled MBP, by mannose and by N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. Among bacterial pathogens often found to cause meningitis, a wide range of MBP binding capacities could be determined. The encapsulated Neisseria meningitidis (representatives from 11 serogroups other than group A were included: n = 22), N. mucosa (n = 1), Haemophilus influenzae type b (n = 10) and Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 5) had a low MBP binding capacity of 21.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.3-40.1%). Escherichia coli K1 (n = 11), Strep. suis (n = 5), Strep. pneumoniae (n = 10) and N. meningitidis serogroup A (n = 2) showed intermediate MBP binding capacity of 58.4% (95% CI 40.0-76.8%). A third group consisting of non-encapsulated Listeria monocytogenes (n = 11), non-encapsulated H. influenzae (n = 2), non-encapsulated N. meningitidis (n = 2), N. cinera (n = 1) and N. subflava (n = 1) strains had a high MBP binding capacity of 87.5% (95% CI 62.5-112.5%). The majority of encapsulated pathogens causing bacterial meningitis seem to have a rather low MBP binding capacity.
TI  - Production and characterisation of mouse monoclonal antibodies reactive with the  lipopolysaccharide core of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to the core antigen region of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were produced from mice immunised with whole cells of heat-killed rough mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa expressing partial or complete core LPS. MAbs were screened in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against three different antigen cocktails: S-form LPS from three P. aeruginosa strains, R-form LPS from six P. aeruginosa strains and, as a negative control, R-form LPS from Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli. Selected MAbs were subsequently screened against a range of extracted LPS and whole cells from both reference strains and clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa. The antibodies were also screened in ELISA against whole-cell antigens from other Pseudomonas spp. as well as strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria subflava and Staphylococcus aureus. Five MAbs reacting with the core component of P. aeruginosa LPS were finally selected. Two of these, MAbs 360.7 and 304.1.4, were particularly reactive in immunoblots against unsubstituted core LPS, including that from O-antigenic serotypes of P. aeruginosa. The MAbs also reacted with some of the other Pseudomonas spp., but not with P. cepacia or Xanthomonas (Pseudomonas) maltophilia. Cross-reactivity with whole cells from other bacterial species was minimal or not observed. Reactivity of MAbs with some Staph. aureus strains was observed, and binding to the protein A component was implicated. The reactivity of the MAbs was investigated further by flow cytometry and immunogold electronmicroscopy. The suitability of the MAbs for an immunological assay for detection of P. aeruginosa in respiratory secretions from CF patients is discussed.
TI  - Enzymatic modification of aminoglycoside antibiotics by Branhamella catarrhalis carrying an R factor.
AB  - Fifteen out of 89 clinical strains of Branhamella catarrhalis isolated from patients at the University Hospital of Zaragoza were resistant to aminoglycosides and other antimicrobials. In two strains, B. catarrhalis 220 and B. catarrhalis 115, the resistance to aminoglycosides was associated with synthesis of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, namely 3"-O-phosphotransferase [APH(3")] and 3'-O-phosphotransferase [APH(3')]. B. catarrhalis 115 was resistant to ampicillin, streptomycin, kanamycin, neomycin, butirosin, lividomycin, ribostamycin, paromomycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and harboured a 32 megadalton (Md) plasmid. The resistance determinants of the latter were transferred to Neisseria subflava by conjugation and to Escherichia coli by transformation. The transconjugant strain presented an antibiotic resistance pattern similar to the donor strain and carried the same plasmid. The transformant strain acquired the 32 Md plasmid but presented, besides the resistance pattern already mentioned, resistance to tetracycline, gentamicin and tobramycin. Resistance to gentamicin and tobramycin was mediated by the synthesis of a 3-N-acetyltransferase. This resistance and the related enzyme were expressed neither in the donor B. catarrhalis strain nor in the transconjugant N. subflava strain.
TI  - Differential attachment by piliated and nonpiliated Neisseria gonorrhoeae to human sperm.
AB  - Piliated type 1 Neisseria gonorrhoeae attached to 50% of human sperm after incubation of mixtures in vitro for 15 min at 35 C. In contrast, nonpiliated type 4 N. gonorrhoeae attached to only 23% of sperm. Similar results were obtained with three different strains of N. gonorrhoeae. Treatment with heat or formaldehyde to kill bacteria did not affect the amount of attachment by piliated or nonpiliated types. Escherichia coli and N. subflava, other species of piliated bacteria, attached to about 40% of sperm, and the nonpiliated species N. meningitidis and N. catarrhalis attached to a comparable number of sperm, as did type 4 N. gonorrhoeae. Prior incubation of type 1 N. gonorrhoeae with purified antibody prepared against gonococcal pili reduced the percentage of sperm with attached bacteria to the same level as that for nonpiliated type 4 gonococci. Similar treatment of other piliated organisms or of nonpiliated Neisseria did not affect the attachment of the bacteria to sperm.
TI  - Deoxyribonucleic acid homologies among species of the genus Neisseria.
AB  - Eleven aerobic species of Neisseria, a Mima sp., and a Herellea sp. were tested for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) homology in direct hybridization experiments. DNA labeled with either (14)C or (32)P was prepared from five species of Neisseria. Unlabeled DNA from the various microorganisms was immobilized on membrane filters, which, after pretreatment, were incubated with labeled DNA (4,000 counts per min per filter) for 14 hr at 67 C. The measure of relatedness was expressed as the relative percentage of direct binding compared to that obtained with homologous DNA. All serological types of N. meningitidis, including the newly proposed types, were homologous to the standard strain of N. meningitidis with one possible exception, type Z. The genus Neisseria is heterogeneous in nature, forming at least three distinct groups: first, N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae; second, N. perflava, N. subflava, N. sicca, N. flavescens, and N. flava; third, N. catarrhalis and N. caviae. Mima and Herellea species show no significant homology with the Neisseria.
