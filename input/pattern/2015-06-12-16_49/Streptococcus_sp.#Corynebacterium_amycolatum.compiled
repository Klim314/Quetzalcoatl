TI  - [The characteristics of Gram-positive bacteria isolated from skin lesions observed in ambulatory patients and the assessment of their susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs].
AB  - The bacterial skin and soft-tissue infections occur commonly and are characterized by more or less intensified changes within skin and subcutaneous tissue. The bacterial skin infections give rise to significant therapeutic problems associated with increasing resistance etiological agents of these infections to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics. The aim of this study was to assess the distribution of various Gram-positive microorganisms in skin lesion observed in ambulatory patients in a period from June 2005 to December 2006. There were 116 bacterial strains isolated and identified from clinical samples: Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase - negative staphylococi (S.epidermidis, S. xylosus, S.capitis, S.saccharolyticus), Propionobacterium acnes, Streptococcus spp. (S.agalactiae, S.pyogenes) i Corynebacterium spp. (C. striatum, C. amycolatum, C. aquaticum). In the further part of this study we analyzed a profile of their susceptibility to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics in relation to drugs recommended for the empirical therapy. The resultant resistance patterns among the examined bacterial isolates are indicative of certain divergence between recommended empirical antibiotic therapy and actual antimicrobial susceptibility of many etiologic factors of skin and soft-tissue infections.
TI  - Native valve endocarditis with aorta-to-left atrial fistula due to Corynebacterium amycolatum.
AB  - Infective endocarditis remains a pathology with a high rate of complications and  mortality. One of the most dramatic complications is abscess formation. A rare evolution of abscess formation is the development of fistula. We describe an 88-year-old woman with an aortic root abscess and aorta-to-left atrial fistula. To our knowledge this has only been described with streptococcus species as causative micro-organism. In this case the abscess was caused by Corynebacterium amycolatum, which is an infrequently found micro-organism.
