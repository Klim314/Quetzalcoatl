TI  == molecular and culture-dependent analyses revealed similarities in the endophytic  bacterial community composition of leaves from three rice (oryza sativa) varieties.
AB  == the endophytic bacterial communities of the three most important rice varieties cultivated in uruguay were compared by a multiphasic approach. leaves of mature plants grown in field experiments for two consecutive crop seasons were studied.  no significant differences were found in the heterotrophic bacterial density for  the three varieties. pantoea ananatis and pseudomonas syringae constituted 51% of the total of the isolates. these species were always present regardless of the variety or the season. molecular analysis based on the 16s rrna gene was performed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) and cloning. t-rflp analysis revealed that bacterial communities grouped according to the variety, although the three varieties presented communities that showed 74% or higher similarities. brevundimonas, the dominant genus in the clone library (18% of the clones), which might be present in all varieties according to t-rflp  profiles, was not recovered by cultivation. conversely, bacteria from the genus pseudomonas were not detected in the clone library. these results indicate that communities established in leaves of physiologically different rice varieties were highly similar and composed by a reduced group of strongly associated and persistent bacteria that were partially recovered by cultivation.

TI  == properties of a novel extracellular cell-free ice nuclei from ice-nucleating pseudomonas antarctica in-74.
AB  == some ice-nucleating bacterial strains, including pantoea ananatis (erwinia uredovora), pseudomonas fluorescens, and pseudomonas syringae isolates, were examined for the ability to shed ice nuclei into the growth medium. a novel ice-nucleating bacterium, pseudomonas antarctica in-74, was isolated from ross island, antarctica. cell-free ice nuclei from p. antarctica in-74 were different  from the conventional cell-free ice nuclei and showed a unique characterization.  cell-free ice nuclei were purified by centrifugation, filtration (0.45 microm), ultrafiltration, and gel filtration. in an ice-nucleating medium in 1 liter of cell culture, maximum growth was obtained with the production of 1.9 mg of cell-free ice nuclei. ice nucleation activity in these cell-free ice nuclei preparations was extremely sensitive to ph. it was demonstrated that the components of cell-free ice nuclei were protein (33%), saccharide (12%), and lipid (55%), indicating that cell-free ice nuclei were lipoglycoproteins. also, carbohydrate and lipid stains showed that cell-free ice nuclei contained both carbohydrate and lipid moieties.
