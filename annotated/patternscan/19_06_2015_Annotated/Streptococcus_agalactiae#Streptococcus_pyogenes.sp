TI  == recombination between streptococcus suis icessu32457 and streptococcus agalactiae icesa2603 yields a hybrid ice transferable to streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == integrative conjugative elements (ices) are mobile genetic elements that reside in the chromosome but retain the ability to undergo excision and to transfer by conjugation. genes involved in drug resistance, virulence, or niche adaptation are often found among backbone genes as cargo dna. we recently characterized in streptococcus suis an ice (icessu32457) carrying resistance genes [tet(o/w/32/o), tet(40), erm(b), apha, and aade] in the 15k unstable genetic element, which is flanked by two approximately 1.3kb direct repeats. remarkably, approximately 1.3-kb sequences are conserved in icesa2603 of streptococcus agalactiae 2603v/r,  which carry heavy metal resistance genes cadc/cada and mer. in matings between s. suis 32457 (donor) and s. agalactiae 2603v/r (recipient), transconjugants were obtained. pcr experiments, pfge, and sequence analysis of transconjugants demonstrated a tandem array between icessu32457 and icesa2603. matings between tandem array-containing s. agalactiae 2603v/r (donor) and streptococcus pyogenes  rf12 (recipient) yielded a single transconjugant containing a hybrid ice, here named icesa2603/icessu32457. the hybrid formed by recombination of the left approximately 1.3-kb sequence of icessu32457 and the approximately 1.3-kb sequence of icesa2603. interestingly, the hybrid ice was transferable between s.  pyogenes strains, thus demonstrating that it behaves as a conventional ice. these findings suggest that both tandem arrays and hybrid ices may contribute to the evolution of antibiotic resistance in streptococci, creating novel mobile elements capable of disseminating new combinations of antibiotic resistance genes.

TI  == surrogate analysis of vancomycin to predict susceptible categorization of dalbavancin.
AB  == dalbavancin (dal) represents a recently approved addition for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssis). newly released antimicrobial agents are rarely found on commercial susceptibility testing devices, and surrogate testing may be an option for clinical microbiology laboratories. a total of 33,688 staphylococcus aureus, 2800 viridans group streptococci (vgs), and 5722 beta-hemolytic streptococci (bhs) were included in this cross-susceptibility (dal versus vancomycin [van]) analysis as well as 4576  coagulase-negative staphylococci and 6515 enterococci (nonindicated species groups). isolates were collected as part of the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program for the united states (usa) and europe (2011-2013). susceptibility testing followed clsi (m07-a9 and m100-s24) methods. usa food and drug administration (dal) and clsi (van) breakpoint criteria were used for correlations between dal and van susceptibility results. a categorical agreement  (ca; susceptible) rate of 99.9% was observed between dal and van when testing s.  aureus. only 48 (0.14%) very major (false-susceptible) errors were noted against  van-susceptible isolates that displayed a dal-nonsusceptible (mic, 0.25 or 0.5mug/ml) phenotype. when susceptible mic correlations were analyzed against indicated bhs species (streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pyogenes), an overall ca rate of 97.7-100.0% was obtained. complete (100.0%) ca was documented  for s. pyogenes, as well as against all vgs isolates, including the indicated streptococcus anginosus group (758 strains). in conclusion, high susceptible ca rates between dal and van were observed when testing a contemporary collection of indicated clinical isolates found in absssi. van-susceptible isolates can be inferred to be inhibited by dal (97.7-100.0%) at the regulatory agency-approved susceptible interpretive breakpoint of </=0.12mug/ml.

TI  == reduction of lactobacillus in the milks of cows with subclinical mastitis.
AB  == clinical and subclinical bovine mastitis are the most frequent diseases encountered on dairy farms worldwide, which cause significant economic loss and veterinary cost. the mastitic disease status is associated with increases in both milk bacterial pathogens and somatic cell count (scc). although it is well established that the mastitic pathogens generally correlate with the milk scc, to our knowledge, the correlation between the probiotic genus, lactobacillus, and the mastitic causative bacteria and scc have not been determined previously. thus, in this study, milk samples from 12 mild and 28 severe subclinical mastitic dairy cows were collected from the same farm. the overall milk bacterial load was quantified with the total plate count method. the lactobacillus genus and 4 common clinical and subclinical mastitic pathogens (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, and trueperella pyogenes) in the sampled milk were enumerated by quantitative pcr. mild and severe subclinical mastitic samples were distinctly separated on the principal component analysis score plot generated based on the quantities of these 5 target bacteria, suggesting that clear differences existed in the microbiological composition between the two sample groups. based on comparison with the pairwise mann-whitney test, the mild subclinical mastitic dairy cows had a significantly higher amounts of lactobacilli (p=0.0175), but lower e. coli (p=0.0002), s. aureus (p<0.0001), s. agalactiae (p=0.0001) and t. pyogenes (p=0.0044) quantities, while an opposite trend occurred in the severe subclinical mastitic group. the negative correlation between lactobacillus and the pathogenic bacteria, as well as the scc, was confirmed with spearman correlation analysis. data generated from the current study may hint to a close relationship between lactobacillus and the health of bovine udder.

TI  == transduction of the streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage phim46.1, carrying resistance genes mef(a) and tet(o), to other streptococcus species.
AB  == phim46.1 - streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage carrying mef(a) and tet(o), respectively, encoding resistance to macrolides (m phenotype) and tetracycline -  is widespread in s. pyogenes but has not been reported outside this species. phim46.1 is transferable in vitro among s. pyogenes isolates, but no information  is available about its transferability to other streptococcus species. we thus investigated phim46.1 for its ability to be transduced in vitro to recipients of  different streptococcus species. transductants were obtained from recipients of streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus suis. retransfer was always achieved, and from s. suis to s. pyogenes occurred at a much greater frequency than in the opposite direction. in transductants phim46.1  retained its functional properties, such as inducibility with mitomycin c, presence both as a prophage and as a free circular form, and transferability. the transductants shared the same phim46.1 chromosomal integration site as the donor, at the 3' end of a conserved rna uracil methyltransferase (rum) gene, which is an integration hotspot for a variety of genetic elements. no transfer occurred to recipients of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus salivarius, even though rum-like genes were also detected in the sequenced genomes of these species. a largely overlapping 18-bp critical sequence, where the site-specific recombination process presumably takes place, was identified in the rum genes of all recipients, including those of the species yielding no transductants. growth assays to evaluate the fitness cost of phim46.1 acquisition disclosed a negligible impact on s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. gordonii transductants and a noticeable fitness advantage in s. suis. the s. suis transductant also displayed marked overexpression of the autolysin-encoding gene  atl.

TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of juniperus excelsa bieb. (cupressaceae) grown in r. macedonia.
AB  == background: there are no information of the yield, chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of berries (eob) or leaves (eol) of juniperus excelsa bieb. (cupressaceae) growing wild in r. macedonia. materials and methods: plant material was collected from two localities during two seasons. essential oil composition was analyzed by gas chromatography/flame ionization detector/mass spectrometry (gc/fid/ms) and antimicrobial screening was made by disc diffusion and broth dilution method. results and discussion: eob yield ranged from 1.6-9.4 ml/kg and from 8.9-13.9 ml/kg for eol. two chemotypes of essential oil were differentiated, alpha-pinene-type (with 70.81% alpha-pinene in eob and 33.83% in eol), also containing limonene, beta-pinene and beta-myrcene while the sabinene-type (with 58.85-62.58% sabinene in eob and 28.52-29.49% in eol), was rich in alpha-pinene, beta-myrcene, limonene, cis-thujone, terpinolene  and alpha-thujene. the most sensitive bacteria to the antimicrobial activity of eob was haemophilus influenzae (mic = 31 mul/ml). eol have showed high activity towards: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae (mic = 125 mul/ml). the pinene-type of essential oil showed moderate activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, corynebacterium spp. and campylobacter jejuni (mic >50%). the sabinene-type of the oil showed moderate activity to streptococcus pyogenes, haemopilus influenzae, campylobacter jejuni and escherichia coli (mic >50%). no activity was observed toward candida albicans. conclusion: the analysis of eob and eol revealed two chemotypes (alpha-pinene and sabinene type) clearly depended on the geographical origin of the macedonian juniperus excelsa which also affected the antimicrobial activity of these oils.

TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils of pinus peuce (pinaceae) growing wild in r. macedonia.
AB  == the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils isolated from twigs with needles (t+n) and from twigs without needles (t-n) from  wild pinus peuce griseb. (pinaceae), from three different locations in r. macedonia, were investigated. essential oil yields of t+n ranged from 7.5 ml/kg to 12.5 ml/kg and for t-n from 13.8 ml/kg to 17.3 ml/kg. gc/fid/ms analysis of the essential oils revealed eighty-four components, representing 93.7-95.7% and 91.2-92.0% of the t+n and t-n oils, respectively. the major components in t+n and t-n oils were monoterpenes: alpha-pinene (23.8-39.9%, 21.2-23.3%), camphene (2.2-5.5%, 0.7-2.0%), beta-pinene (10.1-17.1%, 8.2-16.4%), myrcene (1.2-1.41%, 1.6-2.5%), limonene+beta-phellandrene (6.8-14.0%, 8.8-23.6%) and bornyl acetate (2.3-6.9%, 1.1-3.4%), followed by the sesquiterpenes: trans-(e)-caryophyllene (3.6-4.3%, 3.2-7.3%), germacrene d (7.1-9.5%, 5.0-10.3%) and delta-cadinene (2.1-3.1%, 3.3-4.2%, respectively). antimicrobial screening of the essential oils was made by disk diffusion and broth dilution methods against 13 bacterial isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and one strain of candida albicans. t-n essential oils showed antimicrobial activity toward streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and candida albicans as well as streptococcus agalactiae, acinetobacter spp. and haemophilus influenzae. the antimicrobial activity of t+n essential oils was greater, especially against streptococcus agalactiae, s. pyogenes, enterococcus and candida albicans, followed by haemophilus influenzae, acinetobacter spp., escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of all tested essential oils ranged from 15-125  mul/ml. summarizing the obtained results, the antimicrobial activity of pinus peuce t+n and t-n essential oils collected from different localities in r. macedonia varied considerably. these alterations in the antimicrobial activity can be attributed to the differences in the quantitative composition and percentage amounts of the components present in the respective essential oils, although it was evident that there were no differences in the qualitative composition of the essential oils, regardless of the locality of collection, or the type of plant material (t+n or t-n).

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of azd0914, a new spiropyrimidinetrione dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent activity against gram-positive, fastidious gram-negative, and atypical bacteria.
AB  == azd0914 is a new spiropyrimidinetrione bacterial dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent in vitro antibacterial activity against key gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae), fastidious gram-negative (haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae), atypical (legionella pneumophila), and anaerobic (clostridium difficile) bacterial species, including  isolates with known resistance to fluoroquinolones. azd0914 works via inhibition  of dna biosynthesis and accumulation of double-strand cleavages; this mechanism of inhibition differs from those of other marketed antibacterial compounds. azd0914 stabilizes and arrests the cleaved covalent complex of gyrase with double-strand broken dna under permissive conditions and thus blocks religation of the double-strand cleaved dna to form fused circular dna. whereas this mechanism is similar to that seen with fluoroquinolones, it is mechanistically distinct. azd0914 exhibited low frequencies of spontaneous resistance in s. aureus, and if mutants were obtained, the mutations mapped to gyrb. additionally, no cross-resistance was observed for azd0914 against recent bacterial clinical isolates demonstrating resistance to fluoroquinolones or other drug classes, including macrolides, beta-lactams, glycopeptides, and oxazolidinones. azd0914 was bactericidal in both minimum bactericidal concentration and in vitro time-kill studies. in in vitro checkerboard/synergy testing with 17 comparator antibacterials, only additivity/indifference was observed. the potent in vitro antibacterial activity (including activity against fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates), low frequency of resistance, lack of cross-resistance, and bactericidal activity of azd0914 support its continued development.

TI  == activity of oritavancin against gram-positive clinical isolates responsible for documented skin and soft-tissue infections in european and us hospitals (2010-13).
AB  == objectives: to assess oritavancin activity in vitro against clinically relevant gram-positive pathogens causing skin and soft-tissue infections (sstis) in european and us hospitals. methods: 13 262 consecutive and unique isolates deemed to be responsible for sstis were included. isolates originated from 36 and 27 institutions in europe (israel included) and the usa, respectively, between 2010  and 2013. results: oritavancin (98.8% susceptible) showed modal mic, mic50 and mic90 results of 0.03, 0.03 and 0.06 mg/l, respectively, for staphylococcus aureus. cons from the usa (mic50, 0.015 mg/l) demonstrated an mic50 value of oritavancin slightly lower than those from europe (mic50, 0.03 mg/l). overall, vancomycin-resistant (vana-phenotype) enterococcus faecalis had oritavancin mics  (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5 mg/l) that were 16-fold higher than those obtained for vancomycin-susceptible isolates (mic50/90, 0.015/0.03 mg/l; 99.2%-99.8% susceptible); nevertheless, oritavancin inhibited all vana e. faecalis at </=0.5  mg/l. equivalent oritavancin mics (mic50/90, 0.004/0.008 mg/l) were noted for all vanb and vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium, while higher mics (mic50/90, 0.03/0.12 mg/l) were obtained for vana strains. oritavancin had low mics against the overall populations of streptococcus pyogenes (mic50/90, 0.03/0.12 mg/l; 98.4%-98.6% susceptible), streptococcus agalactiae (mic50/90, 0.03/0.06 mg/l; 97.9%-98.0% susceptible) and the streptococcus anginosus group (mic50/90, 0.008/0.015 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible), with slightly higher mics for streptococcus dysgalactiae (mic50/90, 0.06/0.25 mg/l; >/=98.3% susceptible). conclusions: oritavancin had potent activity in vitro against this contemporary collection of european and us isolates causing sstis. these results describe oritavancin activity against gram-positive pathogens collected shortly prior to its regulatory approval in the usa.

TI  == pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluation of ceftaroline fosamil.
AB  == introduction: ceftaroline fosamil is a 5th generation cephalosporin with an in vitro spectrum of activity including streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. aureus, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella oxytoca, k. pneumoniae and moraxella catarrhalis. it is currently approved by the fda for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssi) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (cabp) in adults. areas covered: this review covers the mechanism of action; bacterial resistance; pharmacokinetic characteristics in various patient populations; pharmacodynamic data in animal and in vitro models as well as human studies; efficacy observed in clinical trials for absssi and cabp; and adverse effects. expert opinion: ceftaroline provides in vitro bactericidal activity against methicillin-, vancomycin-, daptomycin-, and linezolid-resistant gram-positive organisms and select gram-negative pathogens. the pharmacodynamics of ceftaroline is similar to other beta-lactam agents. ceftaroline exhibits a favorable adverse effect profile and is generally well tolerated. there is little data on clinical success of ceftaroline in patients with bacteremia or endocarditis other than what has been  published in a small series of case reports. randomized-control studies are needed to establish clinical outcomes and safety in these patient populations.

TI  == the salivary scavenger and agglutinin in early life: diverse roles in amniotic fluid and in the infant intestine.
AB  == the salivary scavenger and agglutinin (salsa), also known as gp340 and dmbt1, is  an antimicrobial and inflammation-regulating molecule located at the mucosal surfaces. the present study revealed that salsa was present in the amniotic fluid (af) and exceptionally enriched in both meconium and feces of infants. based on immunological and mass spectrometric analysis, salsa was estimated to constitute  up to 4-10% of the total protein amount in meconium, making it one of the most abundant proteins. salsa proteins in the af and intestinal samples were polymorphic and exhibited varying polypeptide compositions. in particular, a different abundance of peptides corresponding to functionally important structures was found in the af and intestinal salsa. the af form of salsa had a more intact structure and contained peptides from the zona pellucida domain, which is involved in cell differentiation and oligomerization. in contrast, the intestinal salsa was more enriched with the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domains. the af, but not the meconium salsa, bound to streptococcus pyogenes, s.  agalactiae, s. gordonii, and escherichia coli. furthermore, differential binding  was observed also to known endogenous ligands c1q, mannose-binding lectin, and secretory iga. our results have thus identified mucosal body compartments, where  salsa is particularly abundant, and suggest that salsa exhibits varying functions in the different mucosal locations. the high levels of salsa in af and the infant intestine suggest a robust and important function for salsa during the fetal development and in the mucosal innate immune defense of infants.

TI  == in vitro selection of mutants resistant to ozenoxacin compared with levofloxacin  and ciprofloxacin in gram-positive cocci.
AB  == objectives: to determine the frequency of selecting mutants resistant to ozenoxacin, a des-fluoro-(6)-quinolone active against pathogens involved in skin  and skin structure infections, compared with levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin in quinolone-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive cocci. methods: forty-nine quinolone-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive cocci strains with different profiles of mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining region (qrdr) were  examined to determine the frequency of selecting mutants resistant to ozenoxacin  compared with levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. mics and mutations in the qrdr were determined by standard broth microdilution and pcr amplification and sequencing,  respectively. results: the mean resistance rates were 3.8 x 10(-9) (range <9 x 10(-11)-1 x 10(-8)) for ozenoxacin, 9.7 x 10(-9) (range <1.1 x 10(-11)-4.2 x 10(-8)) for levofloxacin and 1.2 x 10(-8) (range <1.6 x 10(-10)-2.6 x 10(-7)) for ciprofloxacin. spontaneous mutants resistant to ozenoxacin showed lower mics (</= 16 mg/l) than mutants resistant to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin (</= 512 mg/l). additional mutations were observed only in parc at ser-80 in staphylococcus spp., ser-79 in streptococcus agalactiae and asp-83 and ser-89 in streptococcus pyogenes. conclusions: the probability of ozenoxacin selecting spontaneous resistant mutants in quinolone-susceptible and -resistant strains with pre-existing mutations in the qrdr is low, supporting the potential utility of ozenoxacin as a therapeutic alternative in the treatment of skin infections caused by strains highly resistant to quinolones.

TI  == construction of a chimeric lysin ply187n-v12c with extended lytic activity against staphylococci and streptococci.
AB  == developing chimeric lysins with a wide lytic spectrum would be important for treating some infections caused by multiple pathogenic bacteria. in the present work, a novel chimeric lysin (ply187n-v12c) was constructed by fusing the catalytic domain (ply187n) of the bacteriophage lysin ply187 with the cell binding domain (146-314aa, v12c) of the lysin plyv12. the results showed that the chimeric lysin ply187n-v12c had not only lytic activity similar to ply187n against staphylococcal strains but also extended its lytic activity to streptococci and enterococci, such as streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis, which ply187n could not lyse. our work demonstrated that generating novel chimeric lysins with an extended lytic spectrum was feasible through fusing a catalytic domain with a cell-binding domain from lysins with lytic spectra across multiple genera.

TI  == conjugative transfer of icesde3396 between three beta-hemolytic streptococcal species.
AB  == background: integrative conjugative elements (ices) are mobile genetic elements (mges) that possess all genes necessary for excision, transfer and integration into recipient genome. they also carry accessory genes that impart new phenotypic features to recipient strains. ices therefore play an important role in genomic plasticity and population structure. we previously characterised icesde3396, the  first ice identified in the beta-hemolytic streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp equisimilis (sdse) and demonstrated its transfer to single isolates of streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus, gas) and streptococcus agalactiae  (group b streptococcus, gbs). while molecular studies found the ice in multiple sdse and gbs isolates, it was absent in all gas isolates examined. results: here  we demonstrate that icesde3396:km is transferable from sdse to multiple sdse, gas and gbs isolates. however not all strains of these species were successful recipients under the same growth conditions. to address the role that host factors may have in conjugation we also undertook conjugation experiments in the  presence of a549 epithelial cells and dmem. while horizontal gene transfer (hgt)  occurred, conjugation efficiencies were no greater than when similar experiments  were conducted in dmem. additionally transfer to gas ns235 was successful in the  presence of dmem but not in todd hewitt broth suggesting that nutritional factors may also influence hgt. the gas and gbs transconjugants produced in this study are also able to act as donors of the ice. conclusion: we conclude that ices are  major sources of interspecies hgt between beta-hemolytic streptococci, and by introducing accessory genes imparting novel phenotypic characteristics, have the  potential to alter the population structure of these species.

TI  == subterfuge and sabotage: evasion of host innate defenses by invasive gram-positive bacterial pathogens.
AB  == the development of a severe invasive bacterial infection in an otherwise healthy  individual is one of the most striking and fascinating aspects of human medicine. a small cadre of gram-positive pathogens of the genera streptococcus and staphylococcus stand out for their unique invasive disease potential and sophisticated ability to counteract the multifaceted components of human innate defense. this review illustrates how these leading human disease agents evade host complement deposition and activation, impede phagocyte recruitment and activation, resist the microbicidal activities of host antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species, escape neutrophil extracellular traps, and promote and accelerate phagocyte cell death through the action of pore-forming cytolysins. understanding the molecular basis of bacterial innate immune resistance can open  new avenues for therapeutic intervention geared to disabling specific virulence factors and resensitizing the pathogen to host innate immune clearance.

TI  == establishing a list of qualifying pathogens under the food and drug administration safety and innovation act. final rule.
AB  == the food and drug administration (fda or agency) is issuing a regulation to establish a list of "qualifying pathogens'' that have the potential to pose a serious threat to public health. this final rule implements a provision of the generating antibiotic incentives now (gain) title of the food and drug administration safety and innovation act (fdasia). gain is intended to encourage  development of new antibacterial and antifungal drugs for the treatment of serious or life-threatening infections, and provides incentives such as eligibility for designation as a fast-track product and an additional 5 years of  exclusivity to be added to certain exclusivity periods. based on analyses conducted both in the proposed rule and in response to comments to the proposed rule, fda has determined that the following pathogens comprise the list of ``qualifying pathogens:'' acinetobacter species, aspergillus species, burkholderia cepacia complex, campylobacter species, candida species, clostridium difficile, coccidioides species, cryptococcus species, enterobacteriaceae (e.g.,  klebsiella pneumoniae), enterococcus species, helicobacter pylori, mycobacterium  tuberculosis complex, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, non-tuberculous mycobacteria species, pseudomonas species, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, and vibrio cholerae. the preamble to the  proposed rule described the factors the agency considered and the methodology used to develop the list of qualifying pathogens. as described in the preamble of this final rule, fda applied those factors and that methodology to additional pathogens suggested via comments on the proposed rule.

AB  == a total of 2484 target bacterial pathogens were collected (one per patient episode) from patients in 16 latin american medical centers located in seven nations during 2011. isolate identity was confirmed at a coordinating laboratory  and susceptibility testing was performed for ceftaroline and comparator agents according to reference broth microdilution methods. a total of 30.0% of isolates  were from respiratory tract, 29.4% from skin and skin structure, 21.4% from blood stream, 7.9% from urinary tract and 11.3% from other sites. ceftaroline was active against staphylococcus aureus (42.8% mrsa) with 83.6% of the isolates at </= 1 mg/l and all isolates at </= 2 mg/l (mic5090, 0.25/2mg/l). national mrsa rates ranged from a low of 28.8% in colombia to a high of 68.1% in chile. all streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae were susceptible to ceftaroline (mic50/90 values were at </= 0.015/</= 0.015 mg/l for both). all streptococcus pneumoniae were susceptible to ceftaroline, linezolid, tigecycline  and vancomycin. susceptibility to ceftriaxone was at 88.4% (clsi non-meningitis interpretive criteria) and 73.9% (clsi meningitis interpretive criteria) for all  s. pneumoniae. ceftriaxone susceptibility was only at 33.3% (clsi non-meningitis  interpretive criteria) and 0.0% (clsi meningitis interpretive criteria) for penicillin-intermediate (penicillin mic, 4 mg/l) strains. all haemophilus influenzae (29.4% beta-lactamase-positive) isolates were susceptible to ceftaroline, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin. for the latin american region, the esbl-phenotype rate was 37.6% for escherichia coli and 53.3% for klebsiella pneumoniae. ceftaroline was not active against esbl-phenotype strains but was active against >90.0% of the non-esbl-phenotype. the spectrum of activity of ceftaroline against pathogens from latin america indicates that it merits further study for its potential use in the latin american region.

TI  == cardiopulmonary morbidity of streptococcal infections in a picu.
AB  == aim: the streptococci are important bacteria that cause serious childhood infections. we investigated cardiopulmonary morbidity associated with streptococcal infection and pediatric intensive care unit (picu) admission. methods: a retrospective study between 2002 and 2013 of all children with a laboratory isolation of streptococcus. results: there were 40 (2.3%) picu patients with streptococcal isolations including streptococcus pyogenes (group a  streptococcus, gas, n = 7), streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus, gbs, n = 5), streptococcus pneumoniae (sp, n = 20), alpha-hemolytic (n = 4), beta-hemolytic (n = 2) and gama-hemolytic (n = 2) streptococci. comparing among gas, gbs and sp, respiratory isolates were more likely positive for gas or sp (p  = 0.033), whereas cerebrospinal fluid was more likely positive for gbs (p = 0.002). all gas and gbs, and the majority of sp (90%) were sensitive to penicillin. all sp specimens were sensitive to cefotaxime and vancomycin. these infections were associated with high picu mortality of 43%, 20% and 25%, respectively. isolation of streptococci was associated with a 30% mortality and high rates of need for mechanical ventilatory and inotropic supports. patients with gas, sp or any streptococcal isolation had relative risks [95% confidence interval (ci), p value] of picu deaths of 7.5 (ci 3.1-18.1, p < 0.0001), 4.5 (ci  2.0-9.8, p < 0.0002) and 5.7 (ci 3.4-9.5, p < 0.0001), respectively. in sp, older children had significantly higher prevalence of premorbid conditions such as malignancy, mental retardation/cerebral palsy +/- seizure disorders, chromosomal  or genetic disorders (p = 0.003) than children <5 years of age. serotypes were available for some of these specimens that included 19a, 6b, 3 and 6c. there were four sp deaths with multiorgan system failure and hemolytic uremic syndrome (two  19a and two serotype 3). conclusions: severe streptococcal infections are associated with significant morbidity and mortality despite treatment with systemic antibiotics and intensive care unit support. gas and sp affect the lungs of children, whereas gbs more likely causes meningitis in infants. the expanded coverage of newer polyvalent pneumococcal vaccines can probably prevent infections by serotypes 19a, 19f, 6b and 3.

TI  == influence of pathogenic bacteria species present in the postpartum bovine uterus  on proteome profiles.
AB  == in the first 2-3 weeks after parturition >90% of dairy cows will have some form of uterine infection. uterine contamination with pathogens, such as trueperella (formerly arcanobacterium) pyogenes increases the risk of developing more severe  endometritis, which can reduce conception rates. in this study, we compared the uterine proteome of cows infected with trueperella pyogenes with that of uninfected cows, using 2d gel electrophoresis, and identified annexins a1 and a2  (anxa1 and anxa2), apolipoprotein a-1, calprotectin (s100a9), cathelicidin, enolase 1 (eno1), peptidoglycan recognition protein 1 (pglyrp1), phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (pgam1), serine dehydratase (sds) and serine protease inhibitors (serpin) b1, b3 and b4 proteins as differing in abundance in endometritis. subsequently, levels of ten of these proteins were monitored in uterine samples collected from a herd of lactating, dairy cows at 15 and 42 days post-partum (dpp). the levels were compared with the cytology scores of the samples and the bacterial species isolated from the uterus. cathelicidin, pglyrp1, serpinb1 and s100a9 levels at 15dpp showed strong positive correlations (r=0.78, 0.80, 0.79, and 0.68 respectively; p<0.001) with % of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn). when compared with other bacterial pathogens identified, streptococcus agalactiae and truperella pyogenes induced increased expression of the indicator proteins, suggesting that these organisms may adversely affect the subsequent ability of the cow to conceive. interestingly, there was no difference in the proportion of  cows pregnant at 6 and 17 weeks after start of mating between the cows with high  or low %pmn.

TI  == streptococcus zooepidemicus and streptococcus equi evolution: the role of crisprs.
AB  == the host-restricted bacterium streptococcus equi is the causative agent of equine strangles, the most frequently diagnosed infectious disease of horses worldwide.  the disease is characterized by abscessation of the lymph nodes of the head and neck, leading to significant welfare and economic cost. s. equi is believed to have evolved from an ancestral strain of streptococcus zooepidemicus, an opportunistic pathogen of horses and other animals. comparison of the genome of s. equi strain 4047 with those of s. zooepidemicus identified examples of gene loss due to mutation and deletion, and gene gain through the acquisition of mobile genetic elements that have probably shaped the pathogenic specialization of s. equi. in particular, deletion of the crispr (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) locus in the ancestor of s. equi may have  predisposed the bacterium to acquire and incorporate new genetic material into its genome. these include four prophages and a novel integrative conjugative element. the virulence cargo carried by these mobile genetic elements is believed to have shaped the ability of s. equi to cause strangles. further sequencing of s. zooepidemicus has highlighted the diversity of this opportunistic pathogen. again, crisprs are postulated to influence evolution, balancing the need for gene gain over genome stability. analysis of spacer sequences suggest that these pathogens may be susceptible to a limited range of phages and provide further evidence of cross-species exchange of genetic material among streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus dysgalactiae.

TI  == genetic diversity and virulence properties of streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis from different sources.
AB  == a recent increase in virulence of pathogenic streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (sdse) has been widely proposed. such an increase may be partly explained by the acquisition of new virulence traits by horizontal gene transfer  from related streptococci such as streptococcus pyogenes (gas) and streptococcus  agalactiae (gbs). a collection of 54 sdse strains isolated in italy in the years  2000-2010 from different sources (paediatric throat carriage, invasive and non-invasive diseases) was characterized by emm typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) analysis. the virulence repertoire was evaluated by pcr for the presence of gas superantigen (spe) genes, the streptolysin s (saga) gene, the group g fibronectin-binding protein (gfba) gene and gas-gbs alpha-like protein family (alp) genes; moreover, the ability to invade human epithelial cells was investigated. resistance to tetracycline, erythromycin and clindamycin  was assessed. the combined use of emm typing and pfge proved to be a reliable strategy for the epidemiological analysis of sdse isolates. the most frequent emm types were the same as those more frequently reported in other studies, thus indicating the diffusion of a limited number of a few successful emm types fit to disseminate in humans. the speg gene was detected in sdse strains of different genetic backgrounds. erythromycin resistance determined by the erm(t) gene, and the unusual, foggy mlsb phenotype, observed in one and seven strains, respectively, have never previously, to our knowledge, been reported in sdse. moreover, a new member of the alp family was identified. the identification of new antibiotic and virulence determinants, despite the small size of the sample analysed, shows the importance of constant attention to monitoring the extent of  lateral gene transfer in this emerging pathogen.

TI  == new non-alcoholic formulation for hand disinfection.
AB  == hand washing is considered as the single most important strategy to prevent infections. world health organization (who) defines hand hygiene as a primary issue of personal care with particular reference to hospital personnel and health facility workers. in this work, we investigated a new combination for hand disinfection as an alternative to alcohol-based and chlorhexidine products. the new combination of 5-pyrrolidone-2-carboxylic acid (pca) and copper sulphate pentahydrate (cs) was tested upon different bacterial species that normally colonize hands, including staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus  (mr s. aureus), staphylococcus epidermidis, multidrug resistant s. epidermidis (mdr s. epidermidis), streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, candida albicans and three clinical isolates: mr s. aureus, mdr s. epidermidis, and an e. coli strain. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics),  minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs), fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) indices, and fractional bactericidal concentration (fbc) indices were evaluated. ethanol 70% v/v, isopropanol 60% v/v, and 4% w/v chlorhexidine solution were used as reference hand disinfectants. copper sulphate pentahydrate  was very effective against all tested microorganisms: the mic and mbc for cs ranged from 781 mg/l against s. pyogenes to 12500 mg/l against e. coli strains and c. albicans. in addition, pca exhibited a good antimicrobial activity, in particular, against s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae. the combination of cs and pca  showed a strong synergistic effect and all fic indices were </=0.500. the combination of cs and pca were more effective than ethanol 70% v/v and isopropanol 60% v/v. in addition to antimicrobial activity, the new formulation possesses peculiar features such as residual activity and moisturizing effect. this work identifies a new strategy for hand disinfection.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the canward surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 canadian hospitals from january 2010 to december 2012. in total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method (document m07-a9, 2012), with mics interpreted by using clsi breakpoints (document m100-s23, 2013). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (mic90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, c. freundii, and h. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to clsi mic interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (p. mirabilis) to 54.0% (s. marcescens). all isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (mic90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity  against staphylococci or streptococci. all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.03 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and streptococcus agalactiae (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. we conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to  third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing e. coli and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == menaquinone analogs inhibit growth of bacterial pathogens.
AB  == gram-positive bacteria cause serious human illnesses through combinations of cell surface and secreted virulence factors. we initiated studies with four of these organisms to develop novel topical antibacterial agents that interfere with growth and exotoxin production, focusing on menaquinone analogs. menadione, 1,4-naphthoquinone, and coenzymes q1 to q3 but not menaquinone, phylloquinone, or coenzyme q10 inhibited the growth and to a greater extent exotoxin production of  staphylococcus aureus, bacillus anthracis, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae at concentrations of 10 to 200 mug/ml. coenzyme q1 reduced the ability of s. aureus to cause toxic shock syndrome in a rabbit model, inhibited the growth of four gram-negative bacteria, and synergized with another  antimicrobial agent, glycerol monolaurate, to inhibit s. aureus growth. the staphylococcal two-component system srra/b was shown to be an antibacterial target of coenzyme q1. we hypothesize that menaquinone analogs both induce toxic  reactive oxygen species and affect bacterial plasma membranes and biosynthetic machinery to interfere with two-component systems, respiration, and macromolecular synthesis. these compounds represent a novel class of potential topical therapeutic agents.

TI  == streptococcal vertebral osteomyelitis: multiple faces of the same disease.
AB  == the role of streptococcus species as an aetiological microorganism of vertebral osteomyelitis (vo) is considered to be of little relevance. we aimed to describe  a large number of cases of streptococcal vertebral osteomyelitis (svo), to analyze the clinical features associated with different streptococcus species, and to compare them with a cohort of patients with vo caused by staphylococcus aureus. an incidence study and a retrospective, multicenter, observational clinical study of cases of svo (1991-2011) were performed. statistical comparison of svo by different species and between them and staphylococcal vo was carried out. over the whole period there was an increasing incidence in the number of vos and svos per year (p <0.05). among 58 cases of svo, those caused by non-viridans  streptococcus (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pyogenes; n = 26) mimicked vo by s. aureus, and presented with more fever, neurological symptoms and paravertebral abscesses in comparison with those caused by the viridans group (remaining species). in contrast, the latter have a  sub-acute clinical picture and were associated with the presence of endocarditis  (p <0.05). among non-viridans svos, concomitant infection was specifically related to s. pneumoniae (p <0.05). in conclusion, svo presents a wide range of clinical patterns. the relationship between vo and diagnosis of endocarditis was  established with svo caused by the viridans group. whereas non-viridans svo mimics acute characteristics of vo caused by s. aureus, cases of viridans svo are significantly more likely to have a sub-acute clinical presentation. the increased incidence of svo during the last decades could support a new epidemiological scenario.

TI  == seca localization and seca-dependent secretion occurs at new division septa in group b streptococcus.
AB  == exported proteins of streptococcus agalactiae (gbs), which include proteins localized to the bacterial surface or secreted into the extracellular environment, are key players for commensal and pathogenic interactions in the mammalian host. these proteins are transported across the cytoplasmic membrane via the general seca secretory pathway and those containing the so-called lpxtg sorting motif are covalently attached to the peptidoglycan by sortase a. how seca, sortase a, and lpxtg proteins are spatially distributed in gbs is not known. in the close relative streptococcus pyogenes, it was shown that presence of the ysirkg/s motif (literally ysirkx3gx2s) in the signal peptide (sp) constitutes the targeting information for secretion at the septum. here, using conventional and deconvolution immunofluorescence analyses, we have studied in gbs strain nem316 the localization of seca, srta, and the secreted protein bsp whose signal peptide contains a canonical ysirkg/s motif (yslrkykfglas). replacing the sp of bsp with four other sps containing or not the ysirkg/s motif  did not alter the localized secretion of bsp at the equatorial ring. our results  indicate that secretion and cell wall-anchoring machineries are localized at the  division septum. cell wall- anchored proteins displayed polar (pilb, gbs0791), punctuate (cspa) or uniform distribution (alp2) on the bacterial surface. de novo secretion of gbs0791 following trypsin treatment indicates that it is secreted at the septum, then redistributed along the lateral sides, and finally accumulated to the poles. we conclude that the +/-ysirk sp rule driving compartimentalized secretion is not true in s. agalactiae.

TI  == identification of pathogens in mastitis milk samples with fluorescent in situ hybridization.
AB  == traditionally, the bacteriological examination of mastitis milk samples is performed by culture followed by biochemical tests on the cultured bacteria to allow identification of the causative pathogen. depending on the species involved, this classic identification is time-consuming compared to other techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish), a culture-independent method that utilizes oligonucleotides (labeled with a fluorophore) that are specific to a string of target dna/rna. in the current study, the applicability of fish was evaluated for the detection of mastitis pathogens directly in milk samples. to remove interfering lipids and proteins from mastitis milk samples prior to fish, a previously published enzymatic treatment with savinase was evaluated. fish was performed using oligonucleotides  specific for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, and trueperella (arcanobacterium) pyogenes. the enzymatic pretreatment and the sensitivity of fish were evaluated using spiked whole milk samples and mastitis milk samples with bacterial loads of less than 10(3) up to 10(8) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. bacteria were reliably detected in milk samples with bacterial numbers of 10(6) cfu/ml or higher. however, bacteria present in numbers below 10(6) cfu/ml were not detectable in all cases. the ability of fish to identify mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples, and therefore earlier than classical culture methods, can supplement the classic diagnostic procedures for mastitis milk samples.

TI  == novel bacteriophage lysin with broad lytic activity protects against mixed infection by streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus [gras]) cause serious and sometimes fatal human diseases.  they are among the many gram-positive pathogens for which resistance to leading antibiotics has emerged. as a result, alternative therapies need to be developed  to combat these pathogens. we have identified a novel bacteriophage lysin (plyss2), derived from a streptococcus suis phage, with broad lytic activity against mrsa, vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa), streptococcus suis, listeria, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus equi, streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus [gbs]), s. pyogenes, streptococcus sanguinis, group g streptococci (ggs), group e streptococci (ges),  and streptococcus pneumoniae. plyss2 has an n-terminal cysteine-histidine aminopeptidase (chap) catalytic domain and a c-terminal sh3b binding domain. it is stable at 50 degrees c for 30 min, 37 degrees c for >24 h, 4 degrees c for 15  days, and -80 degrees c for >7 months; it maintained full activity after 10 freeze-thaw cycles. plyss2 at 128 mug/ml in vitro reduced mrsa and s. pyogenes growth by 5 logs and 3 logs within 1 h, respectively, and exhibited a mic of 16 mug/ml for mrsa. a single, 2-mg dose of plyss2 protected 92% (22/24) of the mice  in a bacteremia model of mixed mrsa and s. pyogenes infection. serially increasing exposure of mrsa and s. pyogenes to plyss2 or mupirocin resulted in no observed resistance to plyss2 and resistance to mupirocin. to date, no other lysin has shown such notable broad lytic activity, stability, and efficacy against multiple, leading, human bacterial pathogens; as such, plyss2 has all the characteristics to be an effective therapeutic.

AB  == tetracycline class agents vary widely in their activity against emerging important antimicrobial-resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and acinetobacter spp. also, published susceptibility breakpoints are discordant between the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi), the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast), and regulatory-approved documents. we have assessed the impact of these differences for tetracycline hcl and minocycline when tested against contemporary gram-positive pathogens. the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (2011) compared minocycline and tetracycline hcl activity via reference methods (m07-a9) using a worldwide collection of s. aureus (sa; 4917 strains with 1955 mrsa), streptococcus pneumoniae (spn; 1899), s. pyogenes (gra; 246), and s. agalactiae (grb; 217). regardless of applied categorical breakpoints, minocycline exhibited wider coverage (% susceptible) than tetracycline hcl of 4.5-11.8/0.5-2.6/1.4-2.3/0.4-0.4% for mrsa/spn/grb/gra,  respectively. lower eucast susceptible breakpoints produced reduced susceptibility rates for minocycline ranging from no difference (</=0.5 mug/ml) for gra to -8.9% (</=1 mug/ml) for mrsa (97.2% susceptible by clsi; 88.3% by eucast). use of tetracycline hcl-susceptible results to predict minocycline susceptibility was very accurate (99.0-100.0%), with absolute categorical agreement rates ranging from 92.1% to 98.4% (clsi) to 98.4% to 99.6% (eucast) for streptococci; greatest predictive error was noted using the clsi breakpoints (14.7%) compared to eucast criteria (only 5.0%; acceptable), both for mrsa testing dominated by false-resistant results for minocycline. in conclusion, minocycline demonstrates continued superior in vitro activity compared to tetracycline hcl when testing sa (especially mrsa) and pathogenic streptococci. when testing tetracyclines, laboratories must recognize the expanded spectrum of  minocycline against certain pathogens and utilize methods minimizing interpretive error. we conclude that eucast breakpoint criteria (</=0.5 or </=1 mug/ml) represent the most conservative (better recognize strains with tet resistance mechanisms) and accurate tetracycline breakpoint guidelines for testing contemporary isolates of gram-positive cocci.

TI  == inducible clindamycin resistance in beta-hemolytic streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == background: resistance to macrolides in beta-hemolytic streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae arises primarily due to erm(b) or mef(a). erm(b) typically confers high level resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin b (mlsb phenotype), whereas mef(a) confers low level resistance to  macrolides only (m phenotype). objectives: to investigate the incidence of macrolide resistance mechanisms in isolates of beta-hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci in israel, with particular emphasis on inducible mlsb phenotype. methods: we collected 316 clinical isolates of streptococci during may-august 2010. erythromycin resistance mechanism was determined by the erythromycin-clindamycin double disk diffusion method. results: erythromycin and  clindamycin resistance rates were 19.4% and 13.4% for s. pneumoniae, 4.7% and 1.6% for group a streptococcus (gas), 17% and 17% for group b streptococcus (gbs), and 38.8% and 27.8% for group g streptococcus (ggs) respectively. the most common resistance mechanism for all streptococci was constitutive mlsb (cmlsb). inducible mlss (imlsb) mechanism was found in 3% of all strains and represented 25% of resistance mechanisms. conclusions: the prevalence of macrolide resistance and the distribution of resistance mechanisms differ among beta-hemolytic streptococci and s. pneumoniae, with gbs, ggs and s. pneumoniae showing the highest resistance rate. macrolide or lincosamide cannot be empirically used for  severe streptococcal infections before strains are proved to be susceptible. continuous surveillance of erythromycin and clindamycin resistance patterns among streptococci is needed.

TI  == update of dalbavancin spectrum and potency in the usa: report from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (2011).
AB  == dalbavancin (dal) is an investigational lipoglycopeptide with a prolonged serum half-life allowing once weekly dosing. dal potency was assessed in the 2011 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program among 1555 isolates sampled from all 9  us census regions. monitored gram-positive cocci included staphylococcus aureus (sa; 1,036/50.4% mrsa), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; 115), enterococcus faecalis (25), e. faecium (31), streptococcus pyogenes (155), streptococcus agalactiae (153), and viridans group streptococci (vgs; 40). all susceptibility (s) testing used clinical and laboratory standards institute reference broth microdilution methods and interpretations. dal (mic(50/90), 0.06/0.06 mug/ml) was 8- and 16-fold more active than daptomycin (dap) and vancomycin (van), respectively against sa, with mssa and mrsa having the same mic(90) results. cons was slightly more dal-s (mic(50), </=0.03mug/ml). the highest staphylococcal dal mic was only 0.25 mug/ml. beta-haemolytic streptococci (betahs) and vgs had dal mic results ranging from </=0.03 to 0.25 mug/ml (mic(90), 0.06-0.12 mug/ml), and only enterococci showed elevated dal mic results. vana phenotype-resistant e. faecalis or e. faecium had dal mic values at >/=1 mug/ml; vanb strains were dal-s (mic, </=0.25 mug/ml). all cited dal quantitative values were consistent with earlier surveillance data (2006-2009), without evidence of mic creep. in conclusion, year 2011 sentry program data for dal documents sustained potent activity against sa, cons, betahs, vgs, and van-s  enterococci, which averaged 4- to 32-fold greater than van, dap, or linezolid.

TI  == conjugative transfer and cis-mobilization of a genomic island by an integrative and conjugative element of streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  == putative integrative and conjugative elements (ices), i.e., genomic islands which could excise, self-transfer by conjugation, and integrate into the chromosome of  the bacterial host strain, were previously identified by in silico analysis in the sequenced genomes of streptococcus agalactiae (m. brochet et al., j. bacteriol. 190:6913-6917, 2008). we investigated here the mobility of the elements integrated into the 3' end of a trna(lys) gene. three of the four putative ices tested were found to excise but only one (ice_515_trna(lys)) was found to transfer by conjugation not only to s. agalactiae strains but also to a  streptococcus pyogenes strain. transfer was observed even if recipient cell already carries a related resident ice or a genomic island flanked by attl and attr recombination sites but devoid of conjugation or recombination genes (cis-mobilizable element [cime]). the incoming ice preferentially integrates into the 3' end of the trna(lys) gene (i.e., the attr site of the resident element), leading to a cime-ice structure. transfer of the whole composite element cime-ice was obtained, showing that the cime is mobilizable in cis by the ice. therefore,  genomic islands carrying putative virulence genes but lacking the mobility gene can be mobilized by a related ice after site-specific accretion.

TI  == common regulators of virulence in streptococci.
AB  == streptococcal species are a diverse group of bacteria which can be found in animals and humans. their interactions with host organisms can vary from commensal to pathogenic. many of the pathogenic species are causative agents of severe, invasive infections in their hosts, accounting for a high burden of morbidity and mortality, associated with high economic costs in industry and health care. among them, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus suis are discussed here. an environmentally stimulated and tightly controlled expression of their virulence factors is of utmost importance for their pathogenic potential. thus, the most universal and widespread regulators from the classes of stand-alone transcriptional regulators, two-component signal transduction systems (tcs), eukaryotic-like serine/threonine kinases, and small noncoding rnas are the topic  of this chapter. the regulatory levels are reviewed with respect to function, activity, and their role in pathogenesis. understanding of and interfering with transcriptional regulation mechanisms and networks is a promising basis for the development of novel anti-infective therapies.

TI  == interim susceptibility testing for ceftaroline, a new mrsa-active cephalosporin:  selecting potent surrogate beta-lactam markers to predict ceftaroline activity against clinically indicated species.
AB  == ceftaroline, the bio-active form of parenterally administered ceftaroline fosamil, is a unique broad-spectrum cephalosporin with in vitro and in vivo activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and was approved for clinical use by the united states food and drug administration in october 2010. in over a year since ceftaroline fosamil approval, no widely used commercial susceptibility test system has added this new compound to its product, therefore  requiring use of alternative agar diffusion methods for clinical microbiology laboratories that want to test clinical isolates for ceftaroline susceptibility.  an alternative strategy of applying a surrogate beta-lactam class marker agent was assessed here, using results from 14,902 organisms (2008-2010) sampled in the usa. very high and acceptable accuracy (>/= 99.75%) was observed for predicting ceftaroline susceptibility as follows: 1) use of imipenem or meropenem minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) at </= 8 mug/ml (susceptible and intermediate categories) when testing s. aureus; 2) use of ceftriaxone mic at </= 2 mug/ml (susceptible and intermediate categories) when testing streptococcus pneumoniae as well as other streptococci (s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae); and 3) use of ceftriaxone, or cefepime, or ceftazidime at </= 2 mug/ml (susceptible category) when testing haemophilus influenzae. only when testing indicated enterobacteriaceae species using ceftriaxone susceptibility results did the ceftaroline-nonsusceptible errors increase (4.11%). these presented analyses offer a validated surrogate marker strategy for ceftaroline susceptibility testing, pending development and validation by the commonly used automated systems and agar diffusion commercial methods.

TI  == interspecies mobilization of an ermt-carrying plasmid of streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis by a coresident ice of the icesa2603 family.
AB  == objectives: the recently documented presence of almost identical, small, non-self-transmissible, erm(t)-carrying plasmids in clonally unrelated erythromycin-resistant isolates of streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae suggests that these plasmids somehow circulate in the streptococcal population. the objective of this study was to characterize the erm(t)-carrying genetic element in a clinical isolate of streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (sde5580) and to provide a possible explanation for the spread of erm(t)-carrying plasmids in streptococci. methods: the erm(t)-carrying element of sde5580 was investigated by plasmid analysis, pcr experiments and sequencing. transfer and retransfer experiments were performed using s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae and streptococcus suis strains as recipients and by selection in the presence of suitable drug concentrations. transconjugants were analysed by smai-macrorestriction analysis. genetic studies also included pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using hindiii endonuclease. results: sde5580 contained two mobile genetic elements: a 4950 bp erm(t)-carrying plasmid  (p5580) almost identical to the non-self-transmissible erm(t)-carrying plasmids of s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae mentioned above, and an ~63 kb cadc/cada-carrying integrative and conjugative element (icesde3396-like) of the icesa2603 family. p5580 was transferable at high frequency to the recipients of all three species through in trans mobilization by the coresident icesde3396-like element. p5580 and icesde3396-like were able to be transferred either separately  or together. conclusions: this is the first evidence of horizontal transfer of an erm(t)-carrying plasmid between streptococci. in trans mobilization by coresident ices may be one mechanism for the spread of erm(t)-carrying plasmids in the streptococcal population.

TI  == developing vaccines in the era of genomics: a decade of reverse vaccinology.
AB  == vaccines have a significant impact on public health, and vaccinology in the era of genomics is taking advantage of new technologies to tackle diseases for which  vaccine development has so far been unsuccessful. almost all existing vaccines were developed based on traditional vaccinology methods, which relied on empirical screening of a few candidates at a time, based on known features of the pathogen. however, the ability to sequence a pathogen's genome provides access to its entire antigenic repertoire. as such, genomics has catalysed a shift in vaccine development towards sequence-based 'reverse vaccinology' approaches, which use high-throughput in silico screening of the entire genome of a pathogen  to identify genes that encode proteins with the attributes of good vaccine targets. furthermore, the increasing availability of genome sequences has led to  the development and application of additional technologies to vaccine discovery,  including comparative genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, immunomics and structural genomics. vaccine candidates identified from a pathogen's genome or proteome can then be expressed as recombinant proteins and tested in appropriate  in vitro or in vivo models to assess immunogenicity and protection. the process of reverse vaccinology has been applied to several pathogens, including serogroup b neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and pathogenic escherichia coli, and has provided scores of new candidate antigens for preclinical and clinical investigation. as novel genome-based technologies continue to emerge, it is expected that new vaccines for unmet diseases will be within reach.

TI  == chemical composition of 8 eucalyptus species' essential oils and the evaluation of their antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities.
AB  == background: in 1957, tunisia introduced 117 species of eucalyptus; they have been used as fire wood, for the production of mine wood and to fight erosion. actually, eucalyptus essential oil is traditionally used to treat respiratory tract disorders such as pharyngitis, bronchitis, and sinusitis. a few investigations were reported on the biological activities of eucalyptus oils worldwide. in tunisia, our previous works conducted in 2010 and 2011 had been the first reports to study the antibacterial activities against reference strains. at that time it was not possible to evaluate their antimicrobial activities against  clinical bacterial strains and other pathogens such as virus and fungi. methods:  the essential oils of eight eucalyptus species harvested from the jbel abderrahman, korbous (north east tunisia) and souinet arboreta (north of tunisia) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities by disc diffusion and microbroth dilution methods against seven bacterial isolates: haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. in addition, the bactericidal, fungicidal and the antiviral activities of the tested oils were carried out. results: twenty five components were identified by gc/fid  and gc/ms. these components were used to correlate with the biological activities of the tested oils. the chemical principal component analysis identified three groups, each of them constituted a chemotype. according to the values of zone diameter and percentage of the inhibition (zdi, % i, respectively), four groups and subgroups of bacterial strains and three groups of fungal strains were characterized by their sensitivity levels to eucalyptus oils. the cytotoxic effect and the antiviral activity varied significantly within eucalyptus species  oils. conclusions: e. odorata showed the strongest activity against s. aureus, h. influenzae, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae and against all the tested  fungal strains. in addition, e. odorata oil showed the most cytotoxic effect. however, the best antiviral activity appeared with e. bicostata. virus pretreatment with e. bicostata essential oil showed better antiviral activity (ic(50) = 0.7 mg/ml, si = 22.8) than cell-pretreatment (ic(50) = 4.8 mg/ml, si =  3.33). the essential oil of e. astringens showed antiviral activity only when incubated with virus prior to cell infection. this activity was dose-dependent and the antiviral activity diminished with the decreasing essential oil concentration.

TI  == characterization of a streptococcus suis tet(o/w/32/o)-carrying element transferable to major streptococcal pathogens.
AB  == mosaic tetracycline resistance determinants are a recently discovered class of hybrids of ribosomal protection tet genes. they may show different patterns of mosaicism, but their final size has remained unaltered. initially thought to be confined to a small group of anaerobic bacteria, mosaic tet genes were then found to be widespread. in the genus streptococcus, a mosaic tet gene [tet(o/w/32/o)] was first discovered in streptococcus suis, an emerging drug-resistant pig and human pathogen. in this study, we report the molecular characterization of a tet(o/w/32/o) gene-carrying mobile element from an s. suis isolate. tet(o/w/32/o) was detected, in tandem with tet(40), in a circular 14,741-bp genetic element (39.1% g+c; 17 open reading frames [orfs] identified). the novel element, which we designated 15k, also carried the macrolide resistance determinant erm(b) and an aminoglycoside resistance four-gene cluster including aade (streptomycin) and  apha (kanamycin). 15k appeared to be an unstable genetic element that, in the absence of recombinases, is capable of undergoing spontaneous excision under standard growth conditions. in the integrated form, 15k was found inside a 54,879-bp integrative and conjugative element (ice) (50.5% g+c; 55 orfs), which we designated icessu32457. an approximately 1.3-kb segment that apparently served as the att site for excision of the unstable 15k element was identified. the novel ice was transferable at high frequency to recipients from pathogenic streptococcus species (s. suis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus agalactiae), suggesting that the multiresistance 15k element can successfully spread within streptococcal populations.

TI  == gene repertoire evolution of streptococcus pyogenes inferred from phylogenomic analysis with streptococcus canis and streptococcus dysgalactiae.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes, is an important human pathogen classified within the pyogenic group of streptococci, exclusively adapted to the human host. our goal was to employ a comparative evolutionary approach to better understand the genomic events concomitant with s. pyogenes human adaptation. as part of ascertaining these events, we sequenced the genome of one of the potential sister species, the agricultural pathogen s. canis, and combined it in a comparative genomics reconciliation analysis with two other closely related species, streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus equi, to determine the genes that were gained and lost during s. pyogenes evolution. genome wide phylogenetic analyses involving 15 streptococcus species provided convincing support for a clade of s. equi, s. pyogenes, s. dysgalactiae, and s. canis and suggested that the most likely s. pyogenes sister species was s. dysgalactiae. the reconciliation analysis identified 113 genes that were gained on the lineage leading to s. pyogenes. almost half (46%) of these gained genes were phage associated and 14 showed significant matches to experimentally verified bacteria  virulence factors. subsequent to the origin of s. pyogenes, over half of the phage associated genes were involved in 90 different lgt events, mostly involving different strains of s. pyogenes, but with a high proportion involving the horse  specific pathogen s. equi subsp. equi, with the directionality almost exclusively (86%) in the s. pyogenes to s. equi direction. streptococcus agalactiae appears to have played an important role in the evolution of s. pyogenes with a high proportion of lgts originating from this species. overall the analysis suggests that s. pyogenes adaptation to the human host was achieved in part by (i) the integration of new virulence factors (e.g. speb, and the sal locus) and (ii) the  construction of new regulation networks (e.g. rgg, and to some extent speb).

AB  == the prolonged use of the antibiotics over the years has transformed many organisms resistant to multiple drugs. this has made the field of drug discovery  of vital importance in curing various infections and diseases. the drugs act by binding to a specific target protein of prime importance for the cell's survival. streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes are the few gram positive organisms that have developed resistance to drugs. it causes pneumonia, meningitis, pharyngitis, otitis media, sinusitis, bacteremia, pericarditis, and arthritis infections. the present study was carried out to identify potential drug targets and inhibitors for beta subunit of dna polymerase iii in these three streptococcus species that might facilitate the discovery of novel drugs in near future. various steps were adopted to find out novel drug targets. and finally 3d structure of dna polymerase iii subunit beta was modeled. the ligand library was generated from various databases to find the most suitable ligands. all the ligands were docked using molegro virtual docker and the lead molecules were investigated for adme and toxicity.

TI  == identification of conserved antigens from staphylococcal and streptococcal pathogens.
AB  == the design of vaccines containing epitopes shared between different human pathogens may lead to cross-species protection. in order to identify potentially  conserved bacterial antigens, bacteriophage expression libraries of genomic dna from streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes were probed with human sera from staphylococcus aureus-infected and healthy individuals. by comparison with previous screening data from staphylococcus epidermidis and staph. aureus, putative antigenic, conserved domains across the genera were identified. in particular, three potentially antigenic conserved regions were identified based on the n-terminal domain of sacol0609 (sdrd), the c-terminal domain of sacol0723 (scab) and the c-terminus of sacol1140 (isda) from staph. aureus. the three domains were overexpressed, recombinant proteins were purified and polyclonal antisera raised against them recognized cell surface-located proteins from both staphylococcal and streptococcal species. the antisera were also able to opsonize both staph. aureus and strep. agalactiae thereby increasing their phagocytic uptake by human neutrophils. the conserved antigenic domains therefore represent potential cross-protective vaccine candidates.

TI  == the covs/covr acid response regulator is required for intracellular survival of group b streptococcus in macrophages.
AB  == group b streptococcus (gbs) is a leading cause of neonatal meningitis and septicemia. the ability of this organism to survive inside phagocytic cells is poorly understood but thought to be an important step for the establishment of disease in the host. here, we demonstrate that gbs shows prolonged survival within j774 macrophages and that the capacity to survive is not significantly changed across a diverse range of strains representing different serotypes, multilocus sequence types (mlst), and sites of clinical isolation. using staining for the lysosome-associated membrane protein (lamp) and by pharmacological inhibition of phagosome acidification, we demonstrate that streptococci reside in a phagosome and that acidification of the phagosome is required for gbs to survive intracellularly. moreover, we show that the gbs two-component system covs/covr, which is the major acid response regulator in this organism, is required for survival inside the phagosome.

TI  == streptococcus suis, an emerging drug-resistant animal and human pathogen.
AB  == streptococcus suis, a major porcine pathogen, has been receiving growing attention not only for its role in severe and increasingly reported infections in humans, but also for its involvement in drug resistance. recent studies and the analysis of sequenced genomes have been providing important insights into the s.  suis resistome, and have resulted in the identification of resistance determinants for tetracyclines, macrolides, aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, antifolate drugs, streptothricin, and cadmium salts. resistance gene-carrying genetic elements described so far include integrative and conjugative elements, transposons, genomic islands, phages, and chimeric elements. some of these elements are similar to those reported in major streptococcal pathogens such as streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus agalactiae and share the same chromosomal insertion sites. the available information strongly suggests that s. suis is an important antibiotic resistance reservoir that can contribute to the spread of resistance genes to the above-mentioned streptococci. s. suis is thus a paradigmatic example of possible intersections between animal and human resistomes.

TI  == structure of plantaricin locus of lactobacillus plantarum 8p-a3.
AB  == lactobacillus plantarum 8p-a3 is a strain which is well known on the russian pharmaceutical market and it is included in several probiotic products. the strain has been widely used since 1973 but the mechanisms of its antibacterial activity were unknown. l. plantarum 8p-a3 expressed high antagonistic activity against the wide range of bacterial pathogens including streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae strains. dna sequence analysis of l. plantarum 8p-a3 genome revealed the presence of a complete plantaricin locus of about 20,000 bp encoding genes of at least two bacteriocins--plantaricins ef and  nc8. the plantaricin locus found in l. plantarum 8p-a3 is homologous to the plantaricin cluster in l. plantarum j51.

TI  == surveillance of jnj-q2 activity tested against staphylococcus aureus and beta-hemolytic streptococci as a component of the 2010 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program.
AB  == jnj-q2 is a novel broad-spectrum bactericidal fluorinated 4-quinolone with potent activity against gram-positive and -negative pathogens with a balanced potency against both dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv targets. jnj-q2 is in clinical development for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections (absssis) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. with the use of  reference broth microdilution methods in a central reference laboratory design, mic values were obtained for 3650 pathogens (44.4% were from patients diagnosed with absssi) obtained during the 2010 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program.  isolates were collected from patients in 96 medical centers in 26 countries in north america, europe, latin america, and asia pacific. jnj-q2 demonstrated good  activity overall (mic(50/90), 0.015/0.5 mug/ml) and against 3081 staphylococcus aureus with >95% of the isolates inhibited at a mic of </=0.5 mug/ml; against 1410 levofloxacin-resistant staphylococcus aureus isolates, >90% were inhibited by mic </=0.5 mug/ml. all isolates were inhibited at a mic of </=2 mug/ml. in addition, jnj-q2 demonstrated excellent activity (mic(90), 0.015 mug/ml) against  569 isolates of beta-hemolytic streptococci (including 278 streptococcus pyogenes and 161 streptococcus agalactiae). jnj-q2 was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested overall and against all pathogens when compared directly to moxifloxacin,  levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin.

TI  == rapid identification of bovine mastitis pathogens by high-resolution melt analysis of 16s rdna sequences.
AB  == accurate identification of mastitis pathogens is often compromised when using conventional culture-based methods. here, we report a novel, rapid assay tested for speciation of bacterial mastitis pathogens using high-resolution melt analysis (hrma) of 16s rdna sequences. real-time pcr amplification of 16s rrna gene fragment, spanning the variable region v5 and v6 was performed with a resulting amplicon of 290bp. first, a library was generated of melt curves of 9 common pathogens that are implicated in bovine mastitis. six of the isolates, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus  uberis, staphylococcus aureus and mycoplasma bovis, were type strains while the other 3, arcanobacterium pyogenes, corynebacterium bovis and streptococcus dysgalactiae, were bovine mastitis field isolates. four of the type strains, e. coli, s. agalactiae, k. pneumoniae and s. aureus, were found to be of human origin, while the other 3 type strains were isolated from bovine infections. secondly, the melt curves and corresponding amplicon sequences of a. pyogenes, e. coli, s. agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae, k. pneumoniae, s. uberis and s. aureus were compared with 10 bovine mastitis field isolates of each pathogen. based on the distinct differences in melt curves and sequences between human and bovine isolates of e. coli and k. pneumoniae, it was deemed necessary to select a set of bovine strains for these pathogens to be used as reference strains in the hrma. next, the hrma was validated by three interpreters analyzing the differential clustering pattern of melt curves of 60 bacterial cultures obtained from mastitis milk samples. the three test interpreters were blinded to the culture and sequencing results of the isolates. overall accuracy of the validation assay was  95% as there was difficulty in identifying the streptococci due to heterogeneity  observed in the pcr amplicons of s. uberis. the present study revealed that broad-range real-time pcr with hrma can be used as a powerful, fast and low-cost  tool for the differentiation of clinically important bacterial mastitis pathogens.

TI  == structural differences between the streptococcus agalactiae housekeeping and pilus-specific sortases: srta and srtc1.
AB  == the assembly of pili on the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria requires transpeptidase enzymes called sortases. in streptococcus agalactiae, the pi-1 pilus island of strain 2603v/r encodes two pilus-specific sortases (srtc1 and srtc2) and three pilins (gbs80, gbs52 and gbs104). although either pilus-specific sortase is sufficient for the polymerization of the major pilin, gbs80, incorporation of the minor pilins gbs52 and gbs104 into the pilus structure requires srtc1 and srtc2, respectively. the s. agalactiae housekeeping sortase, srta, whose gene is present at a different location and does not catalyze pilus polymerization, was shown to be involved in cell wall anchoring of pilus polymers. to understand the structural basis of sortases involved in such diverse functions, we determined the crystal structures of s. agalactiae srtc1 and srta.  both enzymes are made of an eight-stranded beta-barrel core with variations in their active site architecture. srta exhibits a catalytic triad arrangement similar to that in streptococcus pyogenes srta but different from that in staphylococcus aureus srta. in contrast, the srtc1 enzyme contains an n-terminal  helical domain and a 'lid' in its putative active site, which is similar to that  seen in streptococcus pneumoniae pilus-specific sortases, although with subtle differences in positioning and composition. to understand the effect of such differences on substrate recognition, we have also determined the crystal structure of a srtc1 mutant, in which the conserved dp(w/f/y) motif was replaced  with the sorting signal motif of gbs80, ipntg. by comparing the structures of wt  wild type srta and srtc1 and the 'lid' mutant of srtc1, we propose that structural elements within the active site and the lid may be important for defining the role of specific sortase in pili biogenesis.

TI  == identification and characterization of plasmid-borne erm(t) macrolide resistance  in group b and group a streptococcus.
AB  == one hundred and seven group b streptococcus (gbs) isolates and 344 group a streptococcus (gas) isolates were collected between 2005 and 2009 from 2 area hospitals and studied for resistance to erythromycin (ery) and clindamycin (cli)  and the presence of the erm(t) macrolide resistance gene. the erm(t) gene was found in 5 (8%) of 61 erythromycin nonsusceptible gbs isolates and in 22 (55%) of 40 erythromycin nonsusceptible gas isolates. the erm(t) gene in all 27 gbs/gas erm(t) gene-positive isolates was located on a plasmid. three erm(t) gene-positive plasmids were dna sequenced. two plasmids (1 each from gbs and gas  isolates) were both 4967 bp in size, contained the erm(t) gene, and differed by only 2 base pairs, suggesting interspecies horizontal transfer of the erm(t) gene containing plasmid. the third (gbs) plasmid was 6825 bp in size and contained gbsi1, a group ii bacterial intron, as well as the erm(t) gene. pulsed-field gel  electrophoresis of all 27 erm(t) gene containing isolates and a selection of erm(t) gene-negative isolates indicated possible clonal expansion among erm(t) gene containing gas isolates, but not among the 5 erm(t) gene-positive gbs isolates.

TI  == [the characteristics of gram-positive bacteria isolated from skin lesions observed in ambulatory patients and the assessment of their susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs].
AB  == the bacterial skin and soft-tissue infections occur commonly and are characterized by more or less intensified changes within skin and subcutaneous tissue. the bacterial skin infections give rise to significant therapeutic problems associated with increasing resistance etiological agents of these infections to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics. the aim of this study was to assess the distribution of various gram-positive microorganisms in skin lesion observed in ambulatory patients in a period from june 2005 to december 2006. there were 116 bacterial strains isolated and identified from clinical samples: staphylococcus aureus, coagulase - negative staphylococi (s.epidermidis, s. xylosus, s.capitis, s.saccharolyticus), propionobacterium acnes, streptococcus spp. (s.agalactiae, s.pyogenes) i corynebacterium spp. (c. striatum, c. amycolatum, c. aquaticum). in the further part of this study we analyzed a profile of their susceptibility to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics in relation  to drugs recommended for the empirical therapy. the resultant resistance patterns among the examined bacterial isolates are indicative of certain divergence between recommended empirical antibiotic therapy and actual antimicrobial susceptibility of many etiologic factors of skin and soft-tissue infections.

TI  == susceptibility of bacterial isolates from community-acquired infections in sub-saharan africa and asia to macrolide antibiotics.
AB  == objective: to review the literature on the susceptibility of common community pathogens in sub-saharan africa and asia to the macrolide antibiotics. methods: inclusion criteria required that isolates were collected since 2004 to ensure results were of contemporary relevance. the data were aggregated by region, age group and sterility of site of culture sample. results: a total of 51 studies were identified, which reported the macrolide antimicrobial susceptibilities of common bacterial pathogens isolated since 2004. in general, there was less macrolide resistance in african than in asian isolates. most african studies reported high levels of macrolide susceptibility in streptococcus pneumoniae, whereas most chinese studies reported high levels of resistance. there was very little information available for gram-negative organisms. conclusions: susceptibility of the pneumococcus to macrolides in ssa remains high in many areas, and good activity of azithromycin has been shown against salmonellae spp.  in asia. in urban areas where high antibiotic consumption is prevalent, there was evidence of increased resistance to macrolides. however, there is no information  on susceptibility from large areas in both continents.

TI  == high-level fluorescence labeling of gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == fluorescence labeling of bacterial pathogens has a broad range of interesting applications including the observation of living bacteria within host cells. we constructed a novel vector based on the e. coli streptococcal shuttle plasmid pat28 that can propagate in numerous bacterial species from different genera. the plasmid harbors a promoterless copy of the green fluorescent variant gene egfp under the control of the camp-factor gene (cfb) promoter of streptococcus agalactiae and was designated pbsu101. upon transfer of the plasmid into streptococci, the bacteria show a distinct and easily detectable fluorescence using a standard fluorescence microscope and quantification by facs-analysis demonstrated values that were 10-50 times increased over the respective controls. to assess the suitability of the construct for high efficiency fluorescence labeling in different gram-positive pathogens, numerous species were transformed. we successfully labeled streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus aureus strains utilizing the egfp reporter plasmid pbsu101. in all of these species the presence of the cfb promoter construct resulted in high-level egfp expression that could be further increased by growing the streptococcal and enterococcal cultures under high oxygen conditions through continuous aeration.

TI  == exploring internal features of 16s rrna gene for identification of clinically relevant species of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == background: streptococcus is an economically important genus as a number of species belonging to this genus are human and animal pathogens. the genus has been divided into different groups based on 16s rrna gene sequence similarity. the variability observed among the members of these groups is low and it is difficult to distinguish them. the present study was taken up to explore 16s rrna gene sequence to develop methods that can be used for preliminary identification  and can supplement the existing methods for identification of clinically-relevant isolates of the genus streptococcus. methods: 16s rrna gene sequences belonging to the isolates of s. dysgalactiae, s. equi, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, s. gallolyticus, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. pneumoniae, s. thermophilus and s. anginosus were analyzed with the purpose to define genetic variability within each species to generate a phylogenetic framework, to identify species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. results: the framework based analysis was used to segregate streptococcus spp. previously  identified upto genus level. this segregation was validated using species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. 43 uncharacterized streptococcus spp. could be identified using this approach. conclusions: the markers generated exploring 16s rrna gene sequences provided useful tool that can be further used for identification of different species of the genus streptococcus.

TI  == incidence and severity of invasive streptococcus pneumoniae, group a streptococcus, and group b streptococcus infections among pregnant and postpartum women.
AB  == background: the epidemiology of streptococcal infection in pregnant and postpartum women is poorly described in recent literature. we used data from multistate surveillance for invasive streptococcus pneumoniae, group a streptococcus (gas), and group b streptococcus (gbs) infections to estimate disease incidence and severity in these populations. methods: cases were reported through the centers for disease control and prevention active bacterial core surveillance, an active population- and laboratory-based system. a case was defined as illness in a woman aged 15-44 years with streptococcus isolated from a normally sterile body site during 2007-2009. pregnant or postpartum status was recorded at the time of culture. incidence was calculated as cases per 1000 woman-years with use of national census data; 95% confidence intervals were calculated on the basis of lambda distribution. we used multivariable logistic regression to explore associations between pregnant or postpartum status and hospital length of stay, a marker of disease severity. results: we identified 1848 cases in women; 6.0% of women were pregnant, and 7.5% were postpartum. pregnant women had a higher mean incidence of gbs disease, compared with nonpregnant women (0.04 cases per 1000 woman-years [range, 0.03-0.05 cases per 1000 woman-years] vs 0.02 cases per 1000 woman-years [range, 0.02-0.02 cases per  1000 woman-years]). postpartum women had elevated mean incidence of all 3 pathogens, compared with nonpregnant women (s. pneumoniae: 0.15 cases per 1000 woman-years [range, 0.09-0.25 cases per 1000 woman-years] vs 0.052 cases per 1000 woman-years [range, 0.049-0.056 cases per 1000 woman-years]; gas: 0.56 cases per  1000 woman-years [range, 0.42-0.70 cases per 1000 woman-years] vs 0.019 cases per 1000 woman-years [range, 0.017-0.021 cases per 1000 woman-years]; gbs: 0.49 cases per 1000 woman-years [range, 0.36-0.64 cases per 1000 woman-years] vs 0.018 [range, 0.016-0.020 cases per 1000 woman-years]). neither pregnancy nor postpartum status was associated with longer length of stay among women infected  with any of the 3 pathogens. conclusions: although invasive streptococcal infections do not appear to be more severe in pregnant or postpartum women, postpartum women have a 20-fold increased incidence of gas and gbs, compared with nonpregnant women.

TI  == comparative genomics and the role of lateral gene transfer in the evolution of bovine adapted streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  == in addition to causing severe invasive infections in humans, streptococcus agalactiae, or group b streptococcus (gbs), is also a major cause of bovine mastitis. here we provide the first genome sequence for s. agalactiae isolated from a cow diagnosed with clinical mastitis (strain fsl s3-026). comparison to eight s. agalactiae genomes obtained from human disease isolates revealed 183 genes specific to the bovine strain. subsequent polymerase chain reaction (pcr) screening for the presence/absence of a subset of these loci in additional bovine and human strains revealed strong differentiation between the two groups (fisher  exact test: p<0.0001). the majority of the bovine strain-specific genes ( approximately 85%) clustered tightly into eight genomic islands, suggesting these genes were acquired through lateral gene transfer (lgt). this bovine gbs also contained an unusually high proportion of insertion sequences (4.3% of the total  genome), suggesting frequent genomic rearrangement. comparison to other mastitis-causing species of bacteria provided strong evidence for two cases of interspecies lgt within the shared bovine environment: bovine s. agalactiae with  streptococcus uberis (nisin u operon) and streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae (lactose operon). we also found evidence for lgt, involving the salivaricin operon, between the bovine s. agalactiae strain and either streptococcus pyogenes or streptococcus salivarius. our findings provide insight  into mechanisms facilitating environmental adaptation and acquisition of potential virulence factors, while highlighting both the key role lgt has played  in the recent evolution of the bovine s. agalactiae strain, and the importance of lgt among pathogens within a shared environment.

TI  == domain movement within a gene: a novel evolutionary mechanism for protein diversification.
AB  == a protein function is carried out by a specific domain localized at a specific position. in the present study, we report that, within a gene, a specific amino acid sequence can move between a certain position and another position. this was  discovered when the sequences of restriction-modification systems within the bacterial species helicobacter pylori were compared. in the specificity subunit of type i restriction-modification systems, dna sequence recognition is mediated  by target recognition domain 1 (trd1) and trd2. to our surprise, several sequences are shared by trd1 and trd2 of genes (alleles) at the same locus (chromosomal location); these domains appear to have moved between the two positions. the gene/protein organization can be represented as x-(trd1)-y-x-(trd2)-y, where x and y represent repeat sequences. movement probably occurs by recombination at these flanking dna repeats. in accordance with this hypothesis, recombination at these repeats also appears to decrease two trds into one trd or increase these two trds to three trds (trd1-trd2-trd2) and to allow trd movement between genes even at different loci. similar movement of domains between trd1 and trd2 was observed for the specificity subunit of a type  iig restriction enzyme. similar movement of domain between trd1 and trd2 was observed for type i restriction-modification enzyme specificity genes in two more eubacterial species, streptococcus pyogenes and mycoplasma agalactiae. lateral domain movements within a protein, which we have designated domo (domain movement), represent novel routes for the diversification of proteins.

AB  == background: the genome of serotype m28 group a streptococcus (gas) strain mgas6180 contains a novel genetic element named region of difference 2 (rd2) that encodes seven putative secreted extracellular proteins. rd2 is present in all serotype m28 strains and strains of several other gas serotypes associated with female urogenital infections. we show here that the gas rd2 element is present in strain mgas6180 both as an integrative chromosomal form and a circular extrachromosomal element. rd2-like regions were identified in publicly available  genome sequences of strains representing three of the five major group b streptococcal serotypes causing human disease. ten rd2-encoded proteins have significant similarity to proteins involved in conjugative transfer of streptococcus thermophilus integrative chromosomal elements (ices). results: we transferred rd2 from gas strain mgas6180 (serotype m28) to serotype m1 and m4 gas strains by filter mating. the copy number of the rd2 element was rapidly and significantly increased following treatment of strain mgas6180 with mitomycin c,  a dna damaging agent. using a pcr-based method, we also identified rd2-like regions in multiple group c and g strains of streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp.equisimilis cultured from invasive human infections. conclusions: taken together, the data indicate that the rd2 element has disseminated by lateral gene transfer to genetically diverse strains of human-pathogenic streptococci.

AB  == the genus streptococcus , a heterogeneous group of gram-positive bacteria, has broad significance in medicine and industry. various streptococci are important ecologically as part of the normal microbial flora of animals and humans; some can also cause diseases that range from subacute to acute or even chronic. among  the significant human diseases attributable to streptococci are scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, glomerulonephritis, and pneumococcal pneumonia. streptococci are essential in industrial and dairy processes and as indicators of pollution. the nomenclature for streptococci, especially the nomenclature in medical use, has been based largely on serogroup identification of cell wall components rather than on species names. for several decades, interest has focused on two major species that cause severe infections: s pyogenes (group a streptococci) and s pneumoniae (pneumococci). in 1984, two members were assigned  a new genus - the group d enterococcal species (which account for 98% of human enterococcal infections) became enterococcus faecalis (the majority of human clinical isolates) and e faecium (associated with a remarkable capacity for antibiotic resistance). in recent years, increasing attention has been given to other streptococcal species, partly because innovations in serogrouping methods have led to advances in understanding the pathogenetic and epidemiologic significance of these species. a variety of cell-associated and extracellular products are produced by streptococci, but their cause-effect relationship with pathogenesis has not been defined. some of the other medically important streptococci are s agalactiae (group b), an etiologic agent of neonatal disease;  e faecalis (group d), a major cause of endocarditis, and the viridans streptococci. particularly for the viridans streptococci, taxonomy and nomenclature are not yet fully reliable or consistent. important members of the viridans streptococci, normal commensals, include s mutans and s sanguis (involved in dental caries), s mitis (associated with bacteremia, meningitis, periodontal disease and pneumonia), and "s milleri" (associated with suppurative  infections in children and adults). there remains persistent taxonomic confusion  regarding "s milleri." these and other streptococci of medical importance are listed intable 13-1by serogroup designation, normal ecologic niche, and associated disease.

TI  == ozone in dentistry: microbiological effects of gas action depending on the method and the time of application using the ozonytron device. experimental study.
AB  == introduction: bactericidal, virucidal, and fungicidal activity of ozone is generally known and has been exploited for years in industry and medicine. ozone  therapy became an inherent element of the treatment of infection in such fields as surgery, dermatology, cosmetics, and dentistry. ozone is a gas, so it penetrates very well even into such tissues and spaces that are not easily accessible. thanks to the property of deep penetration and long ozone presence in tissues after treatment, a long-lasting bactericidal effect is achieved. the action of oxygen radicals is, however, not neutral for the human organism, therefore the use of an appropriate procedure and therapy algorithms is essential. material and methods: we decided to confirm the effect of antibacterial activity of ozone applied by means of the ozonytron device (made by biozonix) on model strains of streptococcus salivarius, pneumonia, pyogenes, and  agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, using two application patterns developed by us. results: we found a statistically significant difference in the size of zones of inhibited bacterial growth on all  media depending on the time of action of ozone. in the present paper, the bactericidal activity of ozone in relation to bacterial strains that are most frequently isolated from the oral cavity was confirmed. what is more, two models  of application of the gas on the infected medium were compared. conclusion: research on the use of ozone in combatting bacteria typical for dental diseases has shown that the gas has an oxidizing effect on these bacteria and is bactericidal.

AB  == many gram-positive pathogens possess external pili or fimbriae with which they adhere to host cells during the infection process. unusual dual intramolecular isopeptide bonds between asn and lys side chains within the n-terminal and c-terminal domains of the pilus subunits have been observed initially in the streptococcus pyogenes pilin subunit spy0128 and subsequently in gbs52 from streptococcus agalactiae, in the bcpa major pilin of bacillus cereus and in the rrgb pilin of streptococcus pneumoniae, among others. within each pilin subunit,  intramolecular isopeptide bonds serve to stabilize the protein. these bonds provide a means to withstand large external mechanical forces, as well as possibly assisting in supporting a conformation favored for pilin subunit polymerization via sortase transpeptidases. genome-wide analyses of pili-containing gram-positive bacteria are known or suspected to contain isopeptide bonds in pilin subunits. for the autocatalytic formation of isopeptide cross-links, a conservation of three amino acids including asn, lys, and a catalytically important acidic glu (or asp) residue are responsible. however, the chemical mechanism of how isopeptide bonds form within pilin remains poorly understood. although it is possible that several mechanistic paths could lead to  isopeptide bond formation in pili, the requirement of a conserved glutamate and highly organized positioning of residues within the hydrophobic environment of the active site were found in numerous pilin crystal structures such as spy0128 and rrgb. this suggests a mechanism involving direct coupling of lysine side chain amine to the asparagine carboxamide mediated by critical acid/base or hydrogen bonding interactions with the catalytic glutamate residue. from this mechanistic perspective, we used the qm/mm minimum free-energy path method to examine the reaction details of forming the isopeptide bonds with spy0128 as a model pilin, specifically focusing on the role of the glutamate in catalysis. it  was determined that the reaction mechanism likely consists of two major steps: the nucleophilic attack on cgamma by nitrogen in the unprotonated lys epsilon-amino group and, then two concerted proton transfers occur during the formation of the intramolecular isopeptide bond to subsequently release ammonia.  more importantly, within the dual active sites of spy0128, glu(117), and glu(258) residues function as crucial catalysts for each isopeptide bond formation, respectively, by relaying two proton transfers. this work also suggests that domain-domain interactions within spy0128 may modulate the reactivity of residues within each active site. our results may hopefully shed light on the molecular mechanisms of pilin biogenesis in gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of e-101 solution, a novel myeloperoxidase-mediated antimicrobial, against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens.
AB  == objectives: e-101 solution (e-101) is a novel myeloperoxidase-mediated antimicrobial. it is composed of porcine myeloperoxidase (pmpo), glucose oxidase, glucose as the substrate and specific amino acids in an aqueous vehicle. e-101 is being developed for topical application directly into surgical wounds to prevent  surgical site infections (ssis). the in vitro activity of e-101 was investigated. methods: mic, mbc, time-kill and antimicrobial combination experiments were performed according to clsi guidelines with modifications. resistance selection studies were performed using a serial passage method. results: e-101 showed mic(90) values of 0.03, 0.5 and 0.5 mg pmpo/l for staphylococci (n = 140), streptococci (n = 95) and enterococci (n = 55), respectively. mic(90) values ranged between 0.03-0.5 and </= 0.004-0.12 mg pmpo/l for enterobacteriaceae (n =  148) and gram-negative non-enterobacteriaceae (n = 92) strains, respectively. there was no antimicrobial tolerance to e-101 for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae or streptococcus pyogenes. time-kill studies demonstrated a rapid (<30 min) bactericidal effect against s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner. there was no evidence of stable resistance to e-101 among staphylococci, enterococci, e. coli or p. aeruginosa strains and no evidence of e-101 interaction with antibiotics commonly used in clinical medicine. conclusions e-101 shows potent and broad-spectrum in vitro activity against bacteria that are the causative pathogens of ssis, thereby providing the impetus to test its clinical utility in the prevention of ssis.

TI  == genomic organization, structure, regulation and pathogenic role of pilus constituents in major pathogenic streptococci and enterococci.
AB  == oligocomponent pilus structures, recently discovered in many important gram-positive pathogens, represent a new class of virulence factors with adhesive and matrix protein-binding activity. some of these proteins have emerged as very  promising lead components of protein-based vaccines against streptococci. these extended surface structures play key roles in host cell and tissue adherence, paracellular translocation, and biofilm formation of major gram-positive pathogens such as streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. pneumoniae as well as in opportunistic and nosocomial pathogens like enterococci. here, we discuss the  similarities and differences of: (1) the genomic organization of the various regions encoding pilus proteins, (2) the number, type, and assembly of the proteins constituting the pili, (3) their expression and regulation mechanisms, (4) their role in bacterial virulence, and (5) their potential as vaccine candidate antigens.

TI  == bacteraemia caused by beta-haemolytic streptococci in north queensland: changing  trends over a 14-year period.
AB  == group a streptococci (gas) are usually the predominant species in cases of bacteraemia caused by beta haemolytic streptococci (bhs). an increasing worldwide incidence of invasive disease from non-group a bhs has been reported. little is known about the changing trends in invasive disease caused by bhs in australia. north queensland has a relatively large indigenous population, who experience significantly higher rates of group a-related disease than the non-indigenous population. this prospective study examined changing trends of disease from large colony bhs that group with a, b, c and g antisera over a 14-year period at the single large tertiary referral hospital in the area. we identified 392 bacteraemic episodes caused by bhs. gas were most commonly isolated (49%), with adjusted rates remaining stable over the period. there was a significant increase in the incidence of non-neonatal bacteraemia caused by group b streptococci (gbs) over the study period (r = 0.58; p 0.030), largely driven by infection in older,  non-indigenous women. rates of bacteraemia caused by group c streptococci also experienced a modest, but significant, increase over time (r = 0.67; p 0.009). gas, which had no predominant emm type, were seen most commonly in indigenous subjects (52%). mortality rates ranged from 3.2% (group g) to 10.3% (group c), with a rate of 7.9% associated with group a disease. the marked rise in gbs disease has been noted worldwide, but the relatively low incidence in indigenous  australian patients has not been described before, despite the burden of well-recognized risk factors for gbs disease within this group.

TI  == myeloperoxidase selectively binds and selectively kills microbes.
AB  == myeloperoxidase (mpo) is reported to selectively bind to bacteria. the present study provides direct evidence of mpo binding selectivity and tests the relationship of selective binding to selective killing. the microbicidal effectiveness of h(2)o(2) and of ocl(-) was compared to that of mpo plus h(2)o(2). synergistic microbicidal action was investigated by combining streptococcus sanguinis, a h(2)o(2)-producing microbe showing low mpo binding, with high-mpo-binding escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, or pseudomonas aeruginosa without exogenous h(2)o(2), with and without mpo, and with and without erythrocytes (red blood cells [rbcs]). selectivity of mpo microbicidal action was conventionally measured as the mpo mic and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) for 82 bacteria including e. coli, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and viridans streptococci. both h(2)o(2) and ocl(-) destroyed rbcs at submicrobicidal concentrations. nanomolar concentrations of mpo increased h(2)o(2) microbicidal action 1,000-fold. streptococci plus mpo produced potent synergistic microbicidal action against all microbes tested, and rbcs caused only a small decrease in potency without erythrocyte damage. mpo directly killed h(2)o(2)-producing s. pyogenes but was ineffective against non-h(2)o(2)-producing e. faecalis. the mpo  mics and mbcs for e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus were significantly lower  than those for e. faecalis. the streptococcal studies showed much higher mic/mbc  results, but such testing required lysed horse blood-supplemented medium, thus preventing valid comparison of these results to those for the other microbes. e.  faecalis mpo binding is reportedly weak compared to binding of e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus but strong compared to binding of streptococci. selective mpo binding results in selective killing.

TI  == socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in the incidence of bacteremic pneumonia among us adults.
AB  == objectives: we examined associations between the socioeconomic characteristics of census tracts and racial/ethnic disparities in the incidence of bacteremic community-acquired pneumonia among us adults. methods: we analyzed data on 4870 adults aged 18 years or older with community-acquired bacteremic pneumonia identified through active, population-based surveillance in 9 states and geocoded to census tract of residence. we used data from the 2000 us census to calculate incidence by age, race/ethnicity, and census tract characteristics and poisson regression to estimate rate ratios (rrs) and 95% confidence intervals (cis). results: during 2003 to 2004, the average annual incidence of bacteremic pneumonia was 24.2 episodes per 100 000 black adults versus 10.1 per 100 000 white adults (rr = 2.40; 95% ci = 2.24, 2.57). incidence among black residents of census tracts with 20% or more of persons in poverty (most impoverished) was 4.4  times the incidence among white residents of census tracts with less than 5% of persons in poverty (least impoverished). racial disparities in incidence were reduced but remained significant in models that controlled for age, census tract  poverty level, and state. conclusions: adults living in impoverished census tracts are at increased risk of bacteremic pneumonia and should be targeted for prevention efforts.

TI  == routine use of point-of-care tests: usefulness and application in clinical microbiology.
AB  == point-of-care (poc) tests offer potentially substantial benefits for the management of infectious diseases, mainly by shortening the time to result and by making the test available at the bedside or at remote care centres. commercial poc tests are already widely available for the diagnosis of bacterial and viral infections and for parasitic diseases, including malaria. infectious diseases specialists and clinical microbiologists should be aware of the indications and limitations of each rapid test, so that they can use them appropriately and correctly interpret their results. the clinical applications and performance of the most relevant and commonly used poc tests are reviewed. some of these tests exhibit insufficient sensitivity, and should therefore be coupled to confirmatory tests when the results are negative (e.g. streptococcus pyogenes rapid antigen detection test), whereas the results of others need to be confirmed when positive (e.g. malaria). new molecular-based tests exhibit better sensitivity and specificity than former immunochromatographic assays (e.g. streptococcus agalactiae detection). in the coming years, further evolution of poc tests may lead to new diagnostic approaches, such as panel testing, targeting not just a single pathogen, but all possible agents suspected in a specific clinical setting. to reach this goal, the development of serology-based and/or molecular-based microarrays/multiplexed tests will be needed. the availability of modern technology and new microfluidic devices will provide clinical microbiologists with the opportunity to be back at the bedside, proposing a large variety of poc tests that will allow quicker diagnosis and improved patient care.

TI  == biological activity of the essential oil of kadsura longipedunculata (schisandraceae) and its major components.
AB  == objectives: the aim was to determine the chemical composition of the essential oil of kadsura longipedunculata and the biological activity of the oil and its major components. methods: the essential oil from stem bark of kadsura longipedunculata was analysed by capillary gas chromatography (glc/fid) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (glc/ms). the ability of the oil to reduce diphenylpicrylhydrazine (dpph(*)) was used to evaluate the antioxidant activity.  inhibition of both lipoxygenase and prostaglandin e(2) was used to assess the anti-inflammatory activity. antimicrobial activity was studied in vitro against a range of bacteria and fungi using diffusion and microdilution methods. inhibition of trypanosome proliferation was assessed using resazurin as vital stain. the in-vitro cytotoxicity of the essential oil on six human cancer cell lines (hepg2, mia paca-2, hela, hl-60, mda-mb-231 and sw-480) was examined using the mtt assay. key findings: fifty compounds, representing 97.63% of total oil, were identified. delta-cadinene (21.79%), camphene (7.27%), borneol (6.05%), cubenol (5.12%) and delta-cadinol (5.11%) were found to be the major components of the oil. the oil exerted a good antimicrobial activity against all gram-positive bacteria tested,  including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis. streptococcus pyogenes and s. agalactiae were the most sensitive bacteria with a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of 60 microg/ml  oil. the essential oil showed a moderate fungicidal activity against yeasts, but  it did not show any activity against gram-negative bacteria. the essential oil showed a good trypanocidal activity in trypanosoma b. brucei with an ic50 value of 50.52 +/- 0.029 microg/ml. radical scavenging activity had an ic50 value of 3.06 +/- 0.79 mg/ml. 5-lipoxygenase inhibition (ic50 = 38.58 microg/ml) and prostaglandin e(2) production inhibition (28.82% at 25 microg/ml) accounted for anti-inflammatory activity of the oil. the oil exhibited some degree of cytotoxic activity against mia paca-2, hepg-2 and sw-480 cell lines with ic50 values of 133.53, 136.96 and 136.62 microg/ml, respectively. the oil increased caspase 3/7  activity (an indicator of apoptosis) 2.5-4 fold in mia paca-2 cells. camphene and borneol did not show antioxidant activity. however, both compounds exhibited some degree of antimicrobial, trypanocidal, anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activity.  conclusions: this investigation provided evidence for, and confirmed the efficacy of, k. longipedunculata, a traditionally used chinese medicinal plant for the treatment of inflammation and infection.

TI  == invasive infection caused by streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis: characteristics of strains and clinical features.
AB  == among clinically isolated beta-hemolytic streptococci, streptococcus pyogenes and s. agalactiae were considered the main pathogens in humans until recently. in 1996, s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (sdse) was proposed as a novel taxon among human-derived streptococcal isolates. sdse has lancefield group c or g antigens, exhibits strong beta-hemolysis, and exerts streptokinase activity upon  human plasminogen and proteolytic activity upon human fibrin. similarly to group  a streptococci, sdse possesses virulence factors including m protein, streptolysin o, streptolysin s, streptokinase, hyaluronidase, c5a peptidase, and  others. sdse may exist among the normal flora of the skin, oropharynx, and gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. in the twenty-first century, invasive  sdse infection (i.e., cellulitis, urosepsis, and pneumonia) leading to various disseminated diseases is being diagnosed increasingly in japan, elsewhere in asia, in europe, and in america. particularly, among elderly patients, these invasive diseases are encountered increasingly in japanese hospital emergency departments. analysis of the part of the emm gene encoding the amino acid sequence at the n-terminal end of the m protein is used to determine the molecular epidemiology of sdse. the distribution of emm types from patients with  invasive or noninvasive infections differs between surveillance results from different countries. in this review, we summarize the characteristics of phenotypes and virulence factors in sdse strains; the review also focuses on emerging sdse infectious disease and future vaccination research.

TI  == mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  == the oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. when this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. the mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the streptococcus (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis) and staphylococcus (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. in addition, some members of both the streptococcus and the staphylococcus genera, as well as porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. the current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. the pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.

AB  == streptococcus mutans antigen i/ii (agi/ii) protein was one of the first cell wall-anchored adhesins identified in gram-positive bacteria. it mediates attachment of s. mutans to tooth surfaces and has been a focus for immunization studies against dental caries. the agi/ii family polypeptides recognize salivary  glycoproteins, and are also involved in biofilm formation, platelet aggregation,  tissue invasion and immune modulation. the genes encoding agi/ii family polypeptides are found among streptococcus species indigenous to the human mouth, as well as in streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae and s. suis. evidence of functionalities for different regions of the agi/ii proteins has emerged. a sequence motif within the c-terminal portion of streptococcus gordonii sspb (agi/ii) is bound by porphyromonas gingivalis, thus promoting oral colonization by this anaerobic pathogen. the significance of other epitopes is now clearer following resolution of regional crystal structures. a new picture emerges of the central v (variable) region, predicted to contain a carbohydrate-binding trench,  being projected from the cell surface by a stalk formed by an unusual association between an n-terminal alpha-helix and a c-terminal polyproline helix. this presentation mode might be important in determining functional conformations of other gram-positive surface proteins that have adhesin domains flanked by alpha-helical and proline-rich regions.

TI  == requirement of the lactobacillus casei maekr two-component system for l-malic acid utilization via a malic enzyme pathway.
AB  == lactobacillus casei can metabolize l-malic acid via malolactic enzyme (malolactic fermentation [mlf]) or malic enzyme (me). whereas utilization of l-malic acid via mlf does not support growth, the me pathway enables l. casei to grow on l-malic acid. in this work, we have identified in the genomes of l. casei strains bl23 and atcc 334 a cluster consisting of two diverging operons, maepe and maekr, encoding a putative malate transporter (maep), an me (maee), and a two-component  (tc) system belonging to the citrate family (maek and maer). homologous clusters  were identified in enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus uberis. our results show that me is essential for l-malic acid utilization in l. casei. furthermore, deletion of either the gene encoding the histidine kinase or the response regulator of the tc system resulted in the loss of the ability to grow on l-malic acid, thus indicating that the cognate tc system regulates and is essential for the expression of me. transcriptional analyses showed that expression of maee is induced in the presence of l-malic acid and repressed by glucose, whereas tc system expression was induced by l-malic acid and was not repressed by glucose. dnase i footprinting analysis showed that maer binds specifically to a set of direct repeats [5'-ttatt(a/t)aa-3'] in the mae promoter region. the location of the repeats strongly suggests that maer activates the expression of the diverging operons maepe and maekr where the first one is also subjected to carbon catabolite repression.

AB  == phim46.1, the recognized representative of the most common variant of mobile, prophage-associated genetic elements carrying resistance genes mef(a) (which confers efflux-mediated erythromycin resistance) and tet(o) (which confers tetracycline resistance) in streptococcus pyogenes, was fully characterized. sequencing of the phim46.1 genome (55,172 bp) demonstrated a modular organization typical of tailed bacteriophages. electron microscopic analysis of mitomycin-induced phim46.1 revealed phage particles with the distinctive icosahedral head and tail morphology of the siphoviridae family. the chromosome integration site was within a 23s rrna uracil methyltransferase gene. blastp analysis revealed that the proteins of phim46.1 had high levels of amino acid sequence similarity to the amino acid sequences of proteins from other prophages, especially phi10394.4 of s. pyogenes and lambdasa04 of s. agalactiae. phage dna was present in the host cell both as a prophage and as free circular dna. the lysogeny module appears to have been split due to the insertion of a segment containing tet(o) (from integrated conjugative element 2096-rd.2) and mef(a) (from a tn1207.1-like transposon) into the unintegrated phage dna. the phage attachment sequence lies in the region between tet(o) and mef(a) in the unintegrated form. thus, whereas in this form tet(o) is approximately 5.5 kb upstream of mef(a), in the integrated form, tet(o), which lies close to the right end of the prophage, is approximately 46.3 kb downstream of mef(a), which lies close to the left end of the prophage.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity profile of oritavancin against recent gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == oritavancin activity was tested against 15,764 gram-positive isolates collected from 246 hospital centers in 25 countries between 2005 and 2008. organisms were staphylococcus aureus (n = 9,075), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 1,664),  enterococcus faecalis (n = 1,738), enterococcus faecium (n = 819), streptococcus  pyogenes (n = 959), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 415), group c, g, and f streptococci (n = 84), and streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1,010). among the evaluated staphylococci, 56.7% were resistant to oxacillin. the vancomycin resistance rate among enterococci was 21.2%. penicillin-resistant and -intermediate rates were 14.7% and 21.4%, respectively, among s. pneumoniae isolates. among nonpneumococcal streptococci, 18.5% were nonsusceptible to erythromycin. oritavancin showed substantial in vitro activity against all organisms tested, regardless of resistance profile. the maximum oritavancin mic against all staphylococci tested (n = 10,739) was 4 microg/ml; the mic(90) against s. aureus was 0.12 microg/ml. against e. faecalis and e. faecium, oritavancin mic(90)s were 0.06 and 0.12, respectively. oritavancin was active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci, including vana strains (n = 486), with mic(90)s of 0.25 and 1 microg/ml against vana e. faecium and e. faecalis, respectively. oritavancin showed potent activity against streptococci (n = 2,468); mic(90)s for the different streptococcal species were between 0.008 and 1 microg/ml. these data are consistent with previous studies with respect to resistance rates of gram-positive isolates and demonstrate the spectrum and in vitro activity of oritavancin against a wide variety of contemporary gram-positive pathogens, regardless of resistance to currently used drugs. the data provide a foundation for interpreting oritavancin activity and potential changes in susceptibility over time once oritavancin enters into clinical use.

TI  == clinical aspects of invasive infections with streptococcus dysgalactiae ssp. equisimilis in japan: differences with respect to streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae infections.
AB  == streptococcus dysgalactiae ssp. equisimilis (sdse) is increasingly being identified as a pathogen responsible for invasive and non-invasive infections. we compared the clinical features of invasive sdse infections with those of invasive infections caused by streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus (gas)) and streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus (gbs)). active surveillance for invasive sdse, gas and gbs was maintained over 1 year at 142 medical institutions throughout japan. clinical information was collected together with isolates, which were characterized microbiologically. two hundred and thirty-one invasive sdse infections were identified, 97 other patients had infections with gas, and 151 had infections with gbs. the median age of the sdse patients was 75 years; 51% were male and 79% had underlying diseases. forty-two sdse patients (19%) presented to the emergency department. among the 150 patients (65%) for whom follow-up was completed, 19 (13%) died and eight (5%) had post-infective sequelae (poor outcome). insufficient white blood cell responses (<5000 cells/microl) and  thrombocytopenia on admission each suggested significantly higher risk of poor outcome (ors 3.6 and 4.5, respectively). of 229 isolates, 55 (24%) showed an stg6792 emm type, which was significantly associated with poor outcome (or 2.4).  clinical manifestations of invasive sdse infections were distinct from those of invasive gbs infections. primary-care doctors should consider invasive sdse infections when treating elderly patients.

TI  == chemical composition and biological activity of the essential oil obtained from bupleurum marginatum (apiaceae).
AB  == objectives: bupleurum marginatum is a herb indigenous to the southern and southwestern part of china. it is widely used in many chinese prescriptions. we aimed to investigate the chemical composition, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and in-vitro cytotoxic activity of the hydrodistilled and extracted essential oil from b. marginatum to validate some of its ethnopharmacologial uses. methods: the essential oil of the aerial parts of b. marginatum was analysed by capillary gas chromatography (glc/fid) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (glc/ms). the ability of the oil to reduce diphenylpicrylhydrazine (dpph(.)) and to prevent the degradation of deoxyribose were used to evaluate the antioxidant activity. inhibition of both prostaglandin e(2) production and lipoxygenase were used to assess the anti-inflammatory activity. antimicrobial activity was studied in vitro against a range of bacteria and fungi. the in-vitro cytotoxicity of the essential oil on six human cancer cell lines (hepg2, caco-2,  ccrf-cem, hela, miapaca-2 and mcf-7) was examined using the mtt assay. key findings: seventy-two components, comprising almost 94.29% of the total peak area, were identified in the analysis. the main components were tridecane (13.18%), undecane (10.42%), pentadecane (8.71%), beta-caryophyllene (5.53%) and  beta-caryophyllene oxide (5.29%). the ability of the oil to reduce diphenylpicrylhydrazine (dpph(.)) and to prevent the degradation of deoxyribose were used to evaluate the antioxidant activity and the corresponding ic50 values  (drug concentration which resulted in a 50% reduction in inhibition of the activity) were found to be 3.66 mg/ml and 17.4 microg/ml, respectively. inhibition of both prostaglandin e(2) production and lipoxygenase were used to assess the anti-inflammatory activity (ic50 of 63.64 microg/ml for lipoxygenase,  26.04% inhibition of prostaglandin e(2) at 25 microg/ml dose). the oil also showed a significant in-vitro antimicrobial activity against gram positive pathogens (streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae) with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values ranging from 0.125 up to 4.00 mg/ml. the in-vitro cytotoxicity of the essential oil on six human cancer cell lines (hepg2, caco-2, ccrf-cem, hela, miapaca-2 and mcf-7) examined using the mtt assay revealed the highest activity to be in the ccrf-cem cell line with an ic50 (concentration which resulted in a 50% reduction in cell viability) of 46.01 microg/ml after 24 h treatment. conclusions: the essential oil of b. marginatum exhibited a promising anti-inflammatory activity along with strong cytotoxicity against many cancer cells (ccrf-cem and hepg2) mediated through induction of apoptosis, and this in-vitro activity make its local traditional uses rational. however, its limited antimicrobial activity indicates that a combination with other drugs is essential for effective use. further selectivity testing is required to evaluate the effect of the oil against normal cells.

TI  == synthesis, spectroscopic characterization and antibacterial activity of new cobalt(ii) complexes of unsymmetrical tetradentate (osn2) schiff base ligands.
AB  == cobalt ion complexes with the schiff bases, (4-x-2-{[2-(2-pyridine-2-yl-ethylsulfanyl)ethylimino]methyl}phenol (x=methoxy (ome), phenylazo (n(2)ph), bromo (br), nitro (no(2))),were synthesized and investigated by several techniques using elemental analysis (c, h, n), ftir, electronic spectra and molar conductivity. the thermal stability of free ligands  and related cobalt complexes were studied by using differential scanning calorimetry (dsc) and thermogravimetric analyses (tga). cyclic voltammetry indicates that the investigated cobalt complexes, under the experimental conditions, have irreversible redox behavior. the synthesized compounds have antibacterial activity against the four gram-positive bacteria: streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus anthracis  and also against the two gram-negative bacteria: klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the activity data show that the parent schiff bases are more potent antibacterials than the cobalt complexes.

AB  == this paper describes a new dna chip, based on the use of a ligation detection reaction coupled to a universal array, developed to detect and analyze, directly  from milk samples, microbial pathogens known to cause bovine, ovine, and caprine  mastitis or to be responsible for foodborne intoxication or infection, or both. probes were designed for the identification of 15 different bacterial groups: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, nonaureus staphylococci, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus equi, streptococcus canis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus parauberis, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus pyogenes, mycoplasma spp., salmonella spp., bacillus spp., campylobacter spp., and escherichia coli and related species. these groups were identified based on the 16s rrna gene. for microarray validation, 22 strains from the american type culture collection or other culture collections and 50 milk samples were tested.  the results demonstrated high specificity, with sensitivity as low as 6 fmol. moreover, the ligation detection reaction-universal array assay allowed for the identification of mycoplasma spp. in a few hours, avoiding the long incubation times of traditional microbiological identification methods. the universal array  described here is a versatile tool able to identify milk pathogens efficiently and rapidly.

TI  == human serum induces streptococcal c5a peptidase expression.
AB  == streptococcus agalactiae is a major pathogen in humans and animals. virulence factors are often associated with mobile genetic elements, and their expression can be modulated by host factors. s. agalactiae harbors the genes for c5a peptidase (scpb) and lmb on a composite transposon structure which is absent in many bovine isolates. to investigate whether these genes participate in the adaptation to human hosts, we determined the influence of human and bovine serum  on the promoter activity of scpb and lmb by using fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. culture in the presence of 1 to 50% human serum resulted in a dose-dependent induction of reporter gene activity for scpb but not lmb. reporter gene activity was, however, unchanged following growth in fetal calf serum. interestingly, a bovine strain did not display any induction of scpb by either bovine or human serum. reverse transcription-pcr analysis was used to confirm differential induction of scpb in s. agalactiae and showed a similar induction of the streptococcus pyogenes c5a peptidase gene scpa by human but not bovine serum. the specific induction of the streptococcal c5a peptidase by human serum corresponds to the absence of scpb in many bovine s. agalactiae isolates and underlines the importance of this virulence factor for human infections.

TI  == leucine-rich repeats of bacterial surface proteins serve as common pattern recognition motifs of human scavenger receptor gp340.
AB  == scavenger receptors are innate immune molecules recognizing and inducing the clearance of non-host as well as modified host molecules. to recognize a wide pattern of invading microbes, many scavenger receptors bind to common pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as lipopolysaccharides and lipoteichoic acids. similarly, the gp340/dmbt1 protein, a member of the human scavenger receptor cysteine-rich protein family, displays a wide ligand repertoire. the peptide motif vevlxxxxw derived from its scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domains is involved in some of these interactions, but most of the  recognition mechanisms are unknown. in this study, we used mass spectrometry sequencing, gene inactivation, and recombinant proteins to identify streptococcus pyogenes protein spy0843 as a recognition receptor of gp340. antibodies against spy0843 are shown to protect against s. pyogenes infection, but no function or host receptor have been identified for the protein. spy0843 belongs to the leucine-rich repeat (lrr) family of eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins. experiments with truncated forms of the recombinant proteins confirmed that the lrr region is needed in the binding of spy0843 to gp340. the same motif of two other lrr proteins, lrrg from the gram-positive s. agalactiae and bspa from the gram-negative tannerella forsythia, also mediated binding to gp340. moreover, inhibition of spy0843 binding occurred with peptides containing the vevlxxxxw motif, but also peptides devoid of the xxxxw motif inhibited binding of lrr proteins. these results thus suggest that the conserved lrr motif in bacterial proteins serves as a novel pattern recognition motif for unique core peptides of  human scavenger receptor gp340.

TI  == capturing host-pathogen interactions by protein microarrays: identification of novel streptococcal proteins binding to human fibronectin, fibrinogen, and c4bp.
AB  == microbial pathogen entry and survival in the host is mediated by a network of molecular interactions between the two partners, which has been the subject of many research efforts. a complex picture is emerging in which host-pathogen crosstalk involves a high number of proteins, often with redundant functions. in  the present study, we investigated the potential of protein microarrays to simultaneously scan interactions between surface proteins from two main human streptococcal pathogens, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae, and three human ligands, fibronectin, fibrinogen, and c4 binding protein, known to play an important role in streptococcal pathogenesis. by using this technology, we confirmed interactions described in the literature and detected a novel set of streptococcal proteins with binding capacities for the human ligands. the observations were validated by western blot and elisa techniques. three of the newly identified proteins were isoforms of a group b streptococcus-secreted component named fib and displayed differential binding capacities for fibronectin, fibrinogen, and c4bp. the protein regions involved in the interaction with each ligand were identified by constructing fragments of one of  the fib variants. the approach proved valuable for the acquisition of novel insights into the complex network of protein-protein interactions occurring during microbial infection.

TI  == substrate specificity of streptococcal unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolases for sulfated glycosaminoglycan.
AB  == unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase (ugl) categorized into the glycoside hydrolase family 88 catalyzes the hydrolytic release of an unsaturated glucuronic acid from glycosaminoglycan disaccharides, which are produced from mammalian extracellular  matrices through the beta-elimination reaction of polysaccharide lyases. here, we show enzyme characteristics of pathogenic streptococcal ugls and structural determinants for the enzyme substrate specificity. the putative genes for ugl and phosphotransferase system for amino sugar, a component of glycosaminoglycans, are assembled into a cluster in the genome of pyogenic and hemolytic streptococci such as streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes, which produce extracellular hyaluronate lyase as a virulent factor. the ugls of these three streptococci were overexpressed in escherichia coli cells, purified, and characterized. streptococcal ugls degraded unsaturated hyaluronate  and chondroitin disaccharides most efficiently at approximately ph 5.5 and 37 degrees c. distinct from bacillus sp. gl1 ugl, streptococcal ugls preferred sulfated substrates. dna microarray and western blotting indicated that the enzyme was constitutively expressed in s. agalactiae cells, although the expression level increased in the presence of glycosaminoglycan. the crystal structure of s. agalactiae ugl (sagugl) was determined at 1.75 a resolution by x-ray crystallography. sagugl adopts alpha(6)/alpha(6)-barrel structure as a basic scaffold similar to bacillus ugl, but the arrangement of amino acid residues in the active site differs between the two. sagugl arg-236 was found to  be one of the residues involved in its activity for the sulfated substrate through structural comparison and site-directed mutagenesis. this is the first report on the structure and function of streptococcal ugls.

TI  == model for substrate interactions in c5a peptidase from streptococcus pyogenes: a  1.9 a crystal structure of the active form of scpa.
AB  == the crystal structure of an active form of scpa has been solved to 1.9 a resolution. scpa is a multidomain cell-envelope subtilase from streptococcus pyogenes that cleaves complement component c5a. the catalytic triad of scpa is geometrically consistent with other subtilases, clearly demonstrating that the additional activation mechanism proposed for the streptococcus agalactiae homologue (scpb) is not required for scpa. the scpa structure revealed that access to the catalytic site is restricted by variable regions in the catalytic domain (vr7, vr9, and vr11) and by the presence of the inserted protease-associated (pa) domain and the second fibronectin type iii domains (fn2). modeling of the scpa-c5a complex indicates that the substrate binds with carboxyl-terminal residues (65-74) extended through the active site and core residues (1-64) forming exosite-type interactions with the fn2 domain. this is reminiscent of the two-site mechanism proposed for c5a binding to its receptor. in the nonprime region of the active site, interactions with the substrate backbone are predicted to be more similar to those observed in kexins, involving  a single beta-strand in the peptidase. however, in contrast to kexins, there would be diminished emphasis on side-chain interactions, with little charged character in the s3-s1 and s6-s4 subsites occupied by the side chains of residues in vr7 and vr9. substrate binding is anticipated to be dominated by ionic interactions in two distinct regions of scpa. on the prime side of the active site, salt bridges are predicted between p1', p2', and p7' residues, and residues in the catalytic and pa domains. remote to the active site, a larger number of ionic interactions between residues in the c5a core and the fn2 domain are observed in the model. thus, both pa and fn2 domains are expected to play significant roles in substrate recognition.

TI  == [comparative in vitro activity of daptomycin against gram-positive microorganisms: sentry surveillance program, spain (2002-2006)].
AB  == introduction and objective: daptomycin is a bactericidal lipopeptide antibiotic,  active against gram-positive bacteria. in this study, the comparative in vitro activity of daptomycin and other antimicrobial agents against isolates recovered  in 3 spanish hospitals from 2002 to 2006 was determined as part of the international sentry antimicrobial resistance surveillance program. the possible  therapeutic role of daptomycin is addressed in the light of spanish susceptibility data. methods: antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed  by the microdilution method with 1398 consecutively recovered gram-positive isolates. results: all the staphylococci (n = 1024), enterococci (n = 228), and streptococci (n = 146) studied were susceptible to daptomycin. the highest mic values were 1, 4, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, regardless of methicillin, vancomycin, or penicillin resistance status. all staphylococcus aureus isolates were also susceptible to vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin. coagulase-negative staphylococci were susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin. only daptomycin and linezolid were active against all enterococcal isolates. in addition, vancomycin, teicoplanin, and ampicillin were fully active against enterococcus faecalis. daptomycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin were active against all streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. viridans group isolates. the distribution of daptomycin mic values in s. aureus and enterococci was homogeneously sustained along the 5-year study period. conclusion: the sustained antimicrobial activity of daptomycin against staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci in spain makes this antibiotic an excellent therapeutic option in severe infection caused by gram-positive microorganisms, including those with multiresistance.

TI  == evasion of macrophage scavenger receptor a-mediated recognition by pathogenic streptococci.
AB  == prr recognize conserved structures on pathogenic microbes and are important for the defense against invading microorganisms. however, accumulating evidence indicates that many pathogens have evolved mechanisms to avoid recognition by prr. one type of prr is the macrophage scavenger receptor a (sr-a), which has been shown to play an important role in recognition and non-opsonic phagocytosis  of pathogenic bacteria. the bacterial ligands for sr-a have been suggested to be  lps or lipoteichoic acid. here, we use murine bone marrow-derived macrophages to  analyze the role of sr-a in non-opsonic phagocytosis of two major gram-positive pathogens, streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus; gbs) and streptococcus pyogenes. we show that the polysaccharide capsule of gbs and the surface m protein of s. pyogenes, two important virulence factors, prevent sr-a-mediated non-opsonic phagocytosis of streptococci. the sialic acid moiety of the gbs capsule was crucial for its ability to prevent recognition by sr-a. moreover, we show that a ligand on gbs recognized by sr-a in the absence of capsule is the surface lipoprotein blr. these findings represent the first example of a microbial strategy to prevent recognition by sr-a and suggest that bacterial surface proteins may be of importance as ligands for sr-a.

TI  == the role of complex carbohydrate catabolism in the pathogenesis of invasive streptococci.
AB  == historically, the study of bacterial catabolism of complex carbohydrates has contributed to understanding basic bacterial physiology. recently, however, genome-wide screens of streptococcal pathogenesis have identified genes encoding  proteins involved in complex carbohydrate catabolism as participating in pathogen infectivity. subsequent studies have focused on specific mechanisms by which carbohydrate utilization proteins might contribute to the ability of streptococci to colonize and infect the host. moreover, transcriptome and biochemical analyses have uncovered novel regulatory pathways by which streptococci link environmental carbohydrate availability to virulence factor production. herein we review new insights into the role of complex carbohydrates in streptococcal host-pathogen interaction.

TI  == [antibiotics susceptibility of streptococcus and enterococcus: data of onerba network].
AB  == this work was aimed to analyze trends in susceptibility to antibiotics among the  main species of beta-hemolytic streptococci involved in community-acquired infections in human (streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae), or in  animals (streptococcus suis and streptococcus uberis) and also among the main enterocci species, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. data were recorded since 1996 through the onerba networks. s. pyogenes, as the other beta-hemolytic streptococci studied remained fully susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. however, susceptibility to macrolides is clearly decreasing in s. pyogenes. in 2002, only 62 to 65% of the strains according to the network considered, were susceptible to erythromycin. a similar trend was observed for s. agalactiae with only 75% of erythromycin susceptibility in 2002, and for both species isolated from animals s. suis and s. uberis, with respectively 35 and 76% of strains susceptible to erythromycin. in enterococci, susceptibility to beta-lactams remained stable between 2000 and 2004. indeed, the susceptibility to aminopenicillins remained high in e. faecalis (about 98%), whereas the proportion of e. faecium isolates susceptible to these antibiotics were lower than 60%. from 1999 to 2004, various studies conducted in french hospitals showed that the vancomycin resistance among enterococci accounted for less than 2%. however, the  recent emergence of glycopeptide resistant enterococci clusters in french hospitals is a matter of concern and emphasizes the need for an ongoing surveillance. such trend in macrolide resistance among s. pyogenes or s. agalactiae should consequently lead to propose other alternatives in case of beta-lactam allergy, and for pharyngitis, to rethink the place of the culture for susceptibility testing.

TI  == characterization of a bacteriophage lysin (ply700) from streptococcus uberis.
AB  == the antibacterial properties of bacteriophage lytic enzymes may be of importance  in future mastitis control programs. a prophage was isolated from a strain of streptococcus uberis (atcc 700407) following exposure to mitomycin c. partial sequencing of the phage dna revealed a putative lysin based on sequence similarity to other streptococcal phage lysins. the putative lysin (ply700) was recombinantly expressed in escherichia coli, and chromatographically purified. addition of the purified ply700 to bacterial suspensions of s. uberis, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus dysgalactiae caused a rapid, calcium-dependent lysis while there was little activity against streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, or e. coli. killing of s. uberis in milk by ply700 (50 microg/ml) was confirmed by plate count assay. activity was related to the initial concentration of bacteria in that 31% killing (p<0.05) was observed with an inoculating dose of approximately 4500 cfu/ml, while 81% killing (p<0.01) was observed when the inoculum was reduced to approximately 600 cfu/ml. in contrast, complete sterilization was observed in parallel cultures suspended in assay buffer indicating that factors in milk are able to neutralize the lysin. functional characterization of the c-terminal domain, as a component of a gfp fusion protein, revealed its calcium-dependent ability to bind to s. uberis. the  c-terminal domain may have utility in targeting s. uberis while it remains to be  determined if the lysin by itself has sufficient potency in milk for effective use in the control of s. uberis mastitis.

TI  == nonimmunodominant regions are effective as building blocks in a streptococcal fusion protein vaccine.
AB  == identification of antigens that elicit protective immunity is essential for effective vaccine development. we investigated the related surface proteins of group b streptococcus, rib and alpha, as potential vaccine candidates. paradoxically, nonimmunodominant regions proved to be of particular interest as vaccine components. mouse antibodies elicited by rib and alpha were directed almost exclusively against the c-terminal repeats and not against the n-terminal  regions. however, a fusion protein derived from the nonimmunodominant n-terminal  regions of rib and alpha was much more immunogenic than one derived from the repeats and was immunogenic even without adjuvant. moreover, antibodies to the n-terminal fusion protein protected against infection and inhibited bacterial invasion of epithelial cells. similarly, the n-terminal region of streptococcus pyogenes m22 protein, which is targeted by opsonic antibodies, is nonimmunodominant. these data indicate that nonimmunodominant regions of bacterial antigens could be valuable for vaccine development.

TI  == improved diagnosis specificity in bone and joint infections using molecular techniques.
AB  == objectives: the microbiological diagnosis of osteoarticular infections currently  relies on microbiological cultures, to specifically target treatment. however, these conventional methods sometimes lack of sensitivity and of specificity to establish definitive diagnosis. this study was conducted to determine whether molecular method could improve bacterial bone and joint infection diagnosis. methods: we evaluated the performance of nucleic acid extraction with the semi-automated nuclisens minimag instrument coupled to 16s rdna sequencing on 76  samples collected from 51 patients with suspected infections: prosthetic-joint infection (15), spondylodiscitis (7) acute septic arthritis (11) and 18 controls. no pre-treatment of the sample was done before nucleic acid extraction. classification in infected group required an accumulation of arguments. results:  our molecular method identified a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and fastidious bacteria like neisseria gonorrhoeae and fusobacterium  nucleatum. the overall pcr sensitivity was 73.3%: 53.8% for prosthetic-joint infections and 88.2% for infections without prostheses. the overall pcr specificity was 95.2%, whereas culture specificity was only 85.7%. conclusions: the instrument was simple to use and provided nucleic acids free of pcr inhibitors and free of contamination by foreign bacterial dna. our study highlights the need for still improved molecular diagnostic sensitivity.

TI  == macrolide resistance trends in beta-hemolytic streptococci in a tertiary korean hospital.
AB  == purpose: erythromycin-resistant beta-hemolytic streptococci (bhs) has recently emerged and quickly spread between and within countries throughout the world. in  this study, we evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and erythromycin resistance mechanisms of bhs during 2003-2004. materials and methods: the mics of seven antimicrobials were determined for 204 clinical isolates of bhs from 2003 to 2004. resistance mechanisms of erythromycin-resistant bhs were studied by the double disk test as well as by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: compared with our previous study, resistance among streptococcus pyogenes isolates to a variety of drugs decreased  strikingly: from 25.7% to 4.8% in erythromycin; 15.8% to 0% in clindamycin; and 47.1% to 19.0% in tetracycline. the prevalent phenotypes and genotypes of macrolide-lincosamide-streptograminb (mlsb) resistance in streptococcus pyogenes  isolates have been changed from the constitutive mlsb phenotype carrying erm(b) to the m phenotype with mef(a) gene. in contrast with streptococcus pyogenes, resistance rates to erythromycin (36.7%), clindamycin (43.1%), and tetracycline (95.4%) in streptococcus agalactiae isolates did not show decreasing trends. among the streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates (lancefield group c, g), resistance rates to erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol were observed to be 9.4%, 3.1%, 68.8%, and 9.4%, respectively. conclusion: continual monitoring of antimicrobial resistance among large-colony-forming bhs is needed to provide the medical community with current  data regarding the resistance mechanisms that are most common to their local or regional environments.

AB  == this study was undertaken to test the in vitro activity of tigecycline against 117 clinically relevant gram-positive pathogens and to correlate this activity with their resistance gene content. overall, tigecycline showed a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) range of 0.015-0.5mg/l, able to inhibit potently all multiresistant streptococci, enterococci and mr staphylococci. tigecycline was active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococci, with mics for 90% of the organisms (mic(90)) of 0.25 mg/l and 0.12 mg/l, respectively, being more active than linezolid (mic(90)=2 mg/l) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (mic(90)=0.5 and 2-4 mg/l, respectively). molecular characterisation of resistance determinants demonstrated the concomitant presence of different classes of genes: in particular, tet(m), erm(b) and erm(c) in streptococcus agalactiae; tet(o), variably associated with different erm genes, in streptococcus pyogenes; vana, tet(m) and erm(b) in enterococcus faecalis, and  vana and erm(b) in enterococcus faecium. all the mrsa strains harboured sccmec and erm genes and 50% possessed tet(k) with tet(m) genes. staphylococcus epidermidis strains were only resistant to erythromycin. these results clearly demonstrate that tigecycline has a mic(90) range of 0.015-0.5 mg/l both against tetracycline-susceptible and -resistant isolates carrying other resistance determinants, suggesting that this drug could play an important role in the treatment of infections caused by these multiresistant gram-positive pathogens.

AB  == background: the aim of the study was to describe the epidemiology of pharyngitis  and pyoderma in a central australian aboriginal community with a high prevalence  of rheumatic heart disease (rhd) and compare it to communities in the top end of  the northern territory. methods: following ethics approval and community consultation, selected households were enrolled and visited over a 13-month period. people were asked if they had a sore throat and/or skin sores and asked about current or recent use of antibiotics; all throats and any pyoderma lesions  were swabbed for bacterial culture. beta-haemolytic streptococci (bhs), including group a streptococcus (gas), were identified in the central laboratory using standard methods. household crowding was also assessed. results were then compared to those from the top end study. results: sore throat was relatively common (480 episodes per 100 person years), although there was only one case of gas pharyngitis in 326 consultations. only 5.5% of children <15 years had pyoderma during the course of the study. this is the opposite picture to that reported in the top end where symptomatic pharyngitis is rare and pyoderma is common. conclusions: although the data are limited, the epidemiology of pharyngitis and pyoderma in this central australian aboriginal community appears  to be more akin to that seen in temperate climates rather than tropical top end communities. in this community, rhd preventative measure should continue to include aggressive treatment of pharyngitis according to recommendations.

TI  == identification of a novel streptococcal gene cassette mediating sos mutagenesis in streptococcus uberis.
AB  == streptococci have been considered to lack the classical sos response, defined by  increased mutation after uv exposure and regulation by lexa. here we report the identification of a potential self-regulated sos mutagenesis gene cassette in the streptococcaceae family. exposure to uv light was found to increase mutations to  antibiotic resistance in streptococcus uberis cultures. the mutational spectra revealed mainly g:c-->a:t transitions, and northern analyses demonstrated increased expression of a y-family dna polymerase resembling umuc under dna-damaging conditions. in the absence of the y-family polymerase, s. uberis cells were sensitive to uv light and to mitomycin c. furthermore, the uv-induced  mutagenesis was almost completely abolished in cells deficient in the y-family polymerase. the gene encoding the y-family polymerase was localized in a four-gene operon including two hypothetical genes and a gene encoding a hdir homolog. electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that s. uberis hdir binds specifically to an inverted repeat sequence in the promoter region of the four-gene operon. database searches revealed conservation of the gene cassette in several streptococcus species, including at least one genome each of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, and streptococcus thermophilus strains. in addition, the umuc operon was localized in several mobile dna elements of streptococcus and lactococcus species. we conclude that the hdir-umuc-orf3-orf4 operon represents a novel gene cassette capable of mediating sos mutagenesis among members of the streptococcaceae.

TI  == evolution of the core and pan-genome of streptococcus: positive selection, recombination, and genome composition.
AB  == background: the genus streptococcus is one of the most diverse and important human and agricultural pathogens. this study employs comparative evolutionary analyses of 26 streptococcus genomes to yield an improved understanding of the relative roles of recombination and positive selection in pathogen adaptation to  their hosts. results: streptococcus genomes exhibit extreme levels of evolutionary plasticity, with high levels of gene gain and loss during species and strain evolution. s. agalactiae has a large pan-genome, with little recombination in its core-genome, while s. pyogenes has a smaller pan-genome and  much more recombination of its core-genome, perhaps reflecting the greater habitat, and gene pool, diversity for s. agalactiae compared to s. pyogenes. core-genome recombination was evident in all lineages (18% to 37% of the core-genome judged to be recombinant), while positive selection was mainly observed during species differentiation (from 11% to 34% of the core-genome). positive selection pressure was unevenly distributed across lineages and biochemical main role categories. s. suis was the lineage with the greatest level of positive selection pressure, the largest number of unique loci selected, and the largest amount of gene gain and loss. conclusion: recombination is an important evolutionary force in shaping streptococcus genomes, not only in the acquisition of significant portions of the genome as lineage specific loci, but also in facilitating rapid evolution of the core-genome. positive selection, although undoubtedly a slower process, has nonetheless played an important role in adaptation of the core-genome of different streptococcus species to different  hosts.

TI  == albomycin is an effective antibiotic, as exemplified with yersinia enterocolitica and streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == albomycin belongs to the class of sideromycins, compounds composed of iron carriers linked to antibiotic moieties. albomycin was found to be active against  bacteria that have a functional ferric hydroxamate transport system meaning that  bacteria will actively transport albomycin until they die. we examined the activity spectrum of albomycin for bacterial pathogens and found that enterobacteriaceae except species of proteus and morganella were sensitive. resistance in the two genera was due to the lack of the ferric hydroxamate transport system. among gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae were highly sensitive, whereas streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus epidermidis were resistant. the in vivo efficacy of albomycin was examined in mice infected with s. pneumoniae or yersinia enterocolitica. a single dose of 10mg albomycin/kg body weight reduced the colony-forming units of y. enterocolitica by three to four orders of magnitude. a single dose of 1mg albomycin/kg body weight was sufficient to clear  s. pneumoniae infections in mice. in direct competition experiments with wild-type s. pneumoniae and its albomycin-resistant mutant, the recovery rate of  the mutant was lower than for the wild-type indicating that the mutant had reduced fitness in the mouse model. we conclude that albomycin is effective in clearing infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in a  mouse model. albomycin treatment reduces the bacterial load allowing the immune system to remove residual albomycin-resistant bacteria, and as such would make albomycin-based antibiotics an adjunct to treatment. the ferrichrome transport system serves as a trojan horse to get albomycin into bacteria.

AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == acute deaths in nonpregnant adults due to invasive streptococcal infections.
AB  == streptococcal organisms, part of the normal human bacterial flora, occasionally become infectious pathogens responsible for a wide array of clinical syndromes, ranging from mild pharyngitis to death. notably, infections due to group a and group b beta-hemolytic strains are well known for causing invasive disease leading to death. these deaths, while often suspected clinically, occasionally are not diagnosed until autopsy. we present 3 rapid deaths, with very different presentations, due to streptococcal infection. two decedents experienced sudden deaths due to pneumonia and severe meningoencephalitis caused by group b beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection, a common cause of neonatal meningitis but only rarely reported in nonpregnant adults. the final case involves a 69-year-old male who presented to the emergency room with a complaint of shoulder pain but over the next several hours developed signs of necrotizing fasciitis, became septic, and died. while antemortem cultures were negative, owing to antibiotic administration, postmortem cultures of bone and deep soft tissue were positive for group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus sp. acute and sudden deaths due to infectious etiology represent an uncommon yet well-documented occurrence. the importance of appropriate postmortem cultures in these situations and a review of the literature will be discussed.

TI  == genotype and phenotype relationship in mlsb resistance in streptococcus pyogenes  and streptococcus agalactiae isolated in central italy.
AB  == the aim of this work is to study a correlation between phenotype and genotype in  clinical isolates of erythromycin-resistant streptococcus spp. among the 25 erythromycin-resistant s. pyogenes, we detected six strains with imlsb, nine with cmlsb and two with m phenotypes. among 14 erythromycin-resistant s. agalactiae, we detected five strains with imlsb, seven with cmlsb and none with an m phenotype. moreover, 8 s. pyogenes and 2 s. agalactiae showed a phenotype not matching the known ones described in literature, defining an unknown phenotype. upon examination, the genetic profiles, erm(a), erm(b) and mef(a), of the clinical isolates did not easily correlate with a specific phenotype. our findings highlighted that the whole matter of phenotypic diversity in macrolide-resistant s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae strains and the correlation with their genetic profiles should be submitted to a more careful analysis of phenotypic and genotypic characterization.

AB  == a total of 593 beta-hemolytic streptococci belonging to lancefield group a (gas), group c (gcs) or group g (ggs) according to agglutination tests were collected from 11 medical institutions between september 2003 and october 2005. in total, 128 strains were identified as streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (s.  equisimilis) using physiological tests. of these strains, 5 strains were agglutinated to lancefield group a, 17 strains to group c, and 106 strains to group g. most of these strains were largely isolated from clinical specimens collected from young patients with respiratory infections and middle-aged patients (in their 40s); most of the strains were isolated from blood, atretic pus, or joint fluid. genetic analysis of the emm gene encoding the m protein revealed that these strains could be classified into 27 types. also, many emm types were found in strains isolated from normally aseptic clinical specimens. in addition, all strains tested had slo, saga, and skcg genes, which contributed to  their virulence. the susceptibility of the strains to oral penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics was excellent, with mics ranging from 0.016 to 0.031mg/ml. in contrast, strains carrying the macrolide resistant elements of the erma, ermb, and mefa genes and strains showing a high resistance to levofloxacin  were also confirmed in this study. these results suggest that beta-hemolytic streptococci, except for s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae, should be reconsidered as a causative pathogen in streptococcal infections.

TI  == gene gain and gene loss in streptococcus: is it driven by habitat?
AB  == bacterial genomes can evolve either by gene gain, gene loss, mutating existing genes, and/or by duplication of existing genes. recent studies have clearly demonstrated that the acquisition of new genes by lateral gene transfer (lgt) is  a predominant force in bacterial evolution. to better understand the significance of lgt, we employed a comparative genomics approach to model species-specific and intraspecies gene insertions/deletions (ins/del among 12 sequenced streptococcal  genomes using a maximum likelihood method. this study indicates that the rate of  gene ins/del is higher on the external branches and varies dramatically for each  species. we have analyzed here some of the experimentally characterized species-specific genes that have been acquired by lgt and conclude that at least  a portion of these genes have a role in adaptation.

TI  == dna methylase activity as a marker for the presence of a family of phage-like elements conferring efflux-mediated macrolide resistance in streptococci.
AB  == recently, two related chimeric genetic elements (tn1207.3 and phi10394.4) were shown to carry the macrolide efflux gene mef in streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococci [gas]). the dissemination of elements belonging to the tn1207.3/phi10394.4 family in recent isolates of gas, streptococcus dysgalactiae  subsp. equisimilis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus agalactiae recovered in portugal was surveyed. in total, 149 gas, 18 s. pneumoniae, 4 s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, and 5 s. agalactiae isolates from infections, presenting the m phenotype of macrolide resistance and containing the mef gene, were screened for the presence of tn1207.3/phi10394.4 by pcr targeting open reading frames (orfs) specific for these related elements. all the gas isolates tested and one of the s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates carried tn1207.3. however, neither of these elements was found in the isolates of the other streptococcal species. it was also noted that the dnas of the isolates carrying tn1207.3 were resistant to cleavage by the endonuclease smai. cloning and expression of orf12 of tn1207.3 in escherichia coli showed that it encoded a  methyltransferase that rendered dna refractory to cleavage by smai (m.spy10394i). using this characteristic as a marker for the presence of the tn1207.3/phi10394.4 family, we reviewed the literature and concluded that these genetic elements are  widely distributed among tetracycline-susceptible gas isolates presenting the m phenotype from diverse geographic origins and may have played an important role in the dissemination of macrolide resistance in this species.

AB  == seven consecutive clinical cases of necrotising fasciitis or necrotic skin lesions (42-78 years old; average 65.0 years of age, three females and four males) due to group a streptococcus, group b streptococcus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the lower extremities, who demonstrated rapid systemic symptoms, were investigated for the usefulness of a bilayer artificial dermis, derived from porcine tendons, over 4 +/- 2.4 years (1-7 years). all surgical debridement was confirmed as sufficiently deep and wide for clinically infected lesions and artificial dermis was applied to all wounds.  the average interval to secondary split-thickness skin grafting was about 17.5 days (17.5 +/- 2.44 days, 21 days max., 14 days min.) and the average thickness was 0.009 +/- 0.0022 in. (range: 0.006 - 0.012 in.). no clinical problems were noted during the application of the artificial dermis and the subsequent skin grafting. since, the donated skin graft was thin, the morbidity was minimised. the use of artificial dermis after extensive surgical debridement in necrotising  fasciitis was easy and effective. local or systemic infection was negligible.

AB  == beta-hemolytic streptococci are common bacterial pathogens that can cause serious invasive disease, and although this group of species has remained susceptible to  the fluoroquinolone class, resistant strains have been reported. this multicenter investigation determined the rate of fluoroquinolone-resistant beta-hemolytic streptococci using the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program network data (1997-2004). forty-seven surveillance culture isolates of beta-hemolytic streptococci from north america and europe with elevated levofloxacin mic results (2 to >32) microg/ml were tested for susceptibility to other fluoroquinolones including ciprofloxacin, garenoxacin, gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, and moxifloxacin using reference broth microdilution and etest (biodisk, solna, sweden) methods. strains were characterized using polymerase chain reaction and sequencing to detect mutations in the quinolone-resistance determining region (qrdr). the beta-hemolytic streptococci isolates with reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility included the following lancefield groups: a (streptococcus pyogenes; 9 strains), b (streptococcus agalactiae; 24 strains), c and g (14 strains). vitek and api 20 strep (biomerieux, hazelwood, mo) identification systems, as well as conventional biochemical methods and colony morphology, were  used to confirm the organism identifications. the overall potency (mic90 in microg/ml) for the fluoroquinolones against all tested beta-hemolytic streptococci showed the following rank order: gemifloxacin (0.06) > garenoxacin (0.12) > moxifloxacin (0.25) > gatifloxacin (0.5) > levofloxacin = ciprofloxacin  (1). the rate of levofloxacin-resistant beta-hemolytic streptococci in the sentry program was 0.14% (europe) and 0.51% (north america) during the study period. all levofloxacin-resistant strains tested by molecular methods had significant mutations in either parc (position 79 or 83) and/or gyra (position 81 or 85). all but 2 isolates with high-level resistance to levofloxacin (>32 microg/ml) had gyra mutations. strains with lower mic values to levofloxacin (2-4 microg/ml) only had mutations in parc. the increasing rate of fluoroquinolone-resistant streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci, and the more recently reported beta-hemolytic streptococci, is becoming a clinical concern due to the morbidity and mortality caused by these pathogens.

TI  == prophagic dna fragments in streptococcus agalactiae strains and association with  neonatal meningitis.
AB  == we identified-by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis at the population level followed by dna differential display, cloning, and sequencing-three prophage dna fragments (f5, f7, and f10) in streptococcus agalactiae that displayed significant sequence similarity to the dna of s. agalactiae and streptococcus pyogenes. the f5 sequence aligned with a prophagic gene encoding the large subunit of a terminase, f7 aligned with a phage-associated cell wall hydrolase and a phage-associated lysin, and f10 aligned with a transcriptional regulator (arpu family) and a phage-associated endonuclease. we first determined the prevalence of f5, f7, and f10 by pcr in a collection of 109 strains isolated in the 1980s and divided into two populations: one with a high risk of causing meningitis (hr group) and the other with a lower  risk of causing meningitis (lr group). these fragments were significantly more prevalent in the hr group than in the lr group (p < 0.001). our findings suggest  that lysogeny has increased the ability of some s. agalactiae strains to invade the neonatal brain endothelium. we then determined the prevalence of f5, f7, and  f10 by pcr in a collection of 40 strains recently isolated from neonatal meningitis cases for comparison with the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) strains isolated in the 1980s. the prevalence of the three prophage dna fragments was similar in these two populations isolated 15 years apart. we suggest that the prophage dna fragments identified have remained stable in many csf s. agalactiae  strains, possibly due to their importance in virulence or fitness.

TI  == the streptococcal blr and slr proteins define a family of surface proteins with leucine-rich repeats: camouflaging by other surface structures.
AB  == regions with tandemly arranged leucine-rich repeats (lrrs) have been found in many prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins, in which they provide a remarkably versatile framework for the formation of ligand-binding sites. bacterial lrr proteins include the recently described slr protein of streptococcus pyogenes, which is related to internalin a of listeria monocytogenes. here, we show that strains of the human pathogen streptococcus agalactiae express a protein, designated blr, which together with slr defines a family of internalin a-related  streptococcal lrr proteins. analysis with specific antibodies demonstrated that blr is largely inaccessible on s. agalactiae grown in vitro, but surface exposure was increased approximately 100-fold on mutants lacking polysaccharide capsule. in s. pyogenes, surface exposure of slr was not affected in a mutant lacking hyaluronic acid capsule but was increased >20-fold in mutants lacking m protein or protein f. thus, both blr and slr are efficiently camouflaged by other surface structures on bacteria grown in vitro. when blr and slr exposed on the bacterial  surface were compared, they exhibited only little immunological cross-reactivity, in spite of extensive residue identity, suggesting that their surface-exposed parts have been under evolutionary pressure to diverge functionally and/or antigenically. these data identify a family of immunologically diverse streptococcal lrr proteins that show unexpected complexity in their interactions  with other bacterial surface components.

TI  == lack of mitogenic activity of speg- and speg(dys)-positive streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis isolates from patients with invasive infections.
AB  == in recent years, streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis has been isolated with an increasing frequency as the cause of invasive streptococcal diseases. for 46 s. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis isolates from invasive infections and four isolates from superficial infections, the presence of emm/emml genes and of genes encoding various different streptococcal superantigens was determined by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). subsequently, pcr products were identified by dna sequencing, and the expression of mrna from superantigen genes was assessed by reverse transcriptase-pcr. the mitogenic activity of s. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis was assessed by [3h]thymidine  incorporation into human lymphocytes and compared with that of streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pyogenes. all s. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis isolates studied harbored an emm/emml gene. only in six of the s. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis isolates from invasive infections, speg was detected by pcr, two of which were further identified as spegdys by sequencing of the pcr product. none of the s. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis isolates harbored any of the genes spea, speb, spec, spef, speh, spei, spej, spek, spel, spem, smez, or ssa of s. pyogenes. in contrast to s. pyogenes, no expression of speg or spegdys  mrna, respectively, was detected in the reverse transcriptase-pcr assay for any of the speg- or spegdys-positive s. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis isolates. moreover, s. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis and s. agalactiae revealed no or very low mitogenic activity, while s. pyogenes was a very powerful inducer of proliferative responses. these findings support the hypothesis that the pathogenicity of s. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis may be associated in part with the presence of emm/emml genes, and suggest that the severity of s. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis invasive infections is not mediated by superantigen-induced mitogenicity.

TI  == ability of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 to participate in bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelial barrier.
AB  == although hundreds of microbial species reside in the human intestinal tract, comparatively few (e.g., escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, enterococcus  faecalis, etc.) are typically associated with systemic infection in postsurgical, shock, and trauma patients. syndecan-1 is the predominant cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on epithelia, and there is substantial evidence that heparan sulfate participates in interactions of a variety of frankly pathogenic microbes with mammalian cells. to investigate the role of syndecan-1 in interactions of enteric flora with intestinal epithelium, bacteria that might  use the enterocyte as a portal of entry for systemic infection (including e. faecalis, e. coli, and other enterobacteria, and several species of staphylococci and streptococci) were studied for their abilities to interact with syndecan-1. streptococcus bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis showed increased adherence to arh-77 cells transfected to express syndecan-1. heparin, a heparan sulfate analog, inhibited internalization of s. bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, and s. aureus by ht-29 enterocytes (prominent  syndecan-1 expression), but not caco-2 enterocytes (relatively low syndecan-1 expression). data from experiments with chinese hamster ovary cells with altered  glycosaminoglycan expression indicated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (glycosaminoglycans on the syndecan-1 ectodomain) participated in bacterial interactions with mammalian cells. thus, although e. faecalis, e. coli, and other gram-negative enterobacteria did not appear to interact with syndecan-1, this heparan sulfate proteoglycan may mediate enterocyte interactions with some staphylococci and streptococci that are known to cause systemic infections in specific populations of high-risk, immunosuppressed, postsurgical,  and trauma patients.

AB  == objectives: pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine (pbd) dimers are synthetic sequence-selective interstrand dna minor-groove cross-linking agents developed from anthramycins. we investigated the antibacterial activity of three dimers, sjg-136, drg-16 and elb-21, which differ in the structure of the pbd monomeric unit and the length of the linker region between the two identical pbd monomers.  methods: mics were determined against 38 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), 20 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre), 12 isolates of streptococcus pyogenes, 12 of streptococcus agalactiae, 12 of listeria monocytogenes and 24 gram-negative clinical isolates. binding to double-stranded  dna was assessed by determination of the dna melting temperature (t(m)). results: mic(90) values for sjg-136 were 0.5 mg/l against mrsa, vre and l. monocytogenes,  0.06 mg/l against s. pyogenes and 0.03 mg/l against s. agalactiae; these were below the maximum tolerated dose of the drug. mic(90)s for drg-16 were 0.125, >0.5, 0.125, 0.015 and <0.008 mg/l, respectively. the most potent compound was elb-21, with corresponding mic(90) values of 0.03, 0.06, 0.06, 0.015 and 0.015 mg/l. there was little or no variation in sensitivity amongst isolates from any one species. all gram-negative species (acinetobacter, pseudomonas, klebsiella, proteus spp.) were not susceptible due to the barrier function of the outer membrane. pbd dimers showed bactericidal activity against mrsa and vre and there  was a significant post-antibiotic effect (1.5--3.5 h). incubation of emrsa-16 genomic dna (50 microm) with 20 microm elb-21 resulted in a large increase in t(m) suggesting that pbd dimers exert their antibacterial effect by cross-linking of the two dna strands. conclusions: these data indicate that this novel class of antibacterial agents warrants further investigation as potential antibiotics for  the treatment of severe infections caused by gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == group b streptococcal soft tissue infections in non-pregnant adults.
AB  == skin and soft tissue infections are the most common presentations of invasive streptococcus agalactiae infections. this study reviewed 71 patients in a medical centre in southern taiwan with s. agalactiae soft tissue infections. the mortality rate was 7%, and 11% of patients lost their extremities following extensive tissue necrosis. critical illness and the presence of cutaneous ulceration heralded a fatal prognosis. risk-factors for amputation of limbs included advanced age, cutaneous ulceration and polymicrobial infection. it was concluded that invasive s. agalactiae soft tissue infections, as with infections  caused by streptococcus pyogenes, can also lead to substantial morbidity and mortality in non-pregnant adults.

TI  == invasive group a, b, c and g streptococcal infections in denmark 1999-2002: epidemiological and clinical aspects.
AB  == group a streptococci (gas) have been described frequently as an emerging cause of severe invasive infections in population-based surveillance studies, whereas the  descriptions of group b, c and g streptococci (gbs, gcs and ggs) have been less frequent. enhanced surveillance for invasive gas, gbs, gcs and ggs was performed  in denmark in 1999-2002. a detailed questionnaire was completed for 1237 (98%) of 1260 invasive infections. gas infections dominated (40%), followed by ggs (32%),  gbs (23%) and gcs (6%). most (74%) patients had predisposing factors, and there were no significant differences between the four serogroups when comparing the prevalence of cancer, diabetes mellitus, chronic heart or lung diseases, immunodeficiency or alcohol abuse. the overall case fatality rate at day 30 was 21%, increasing significantly to 59% for patients with streptococcal toxic shock  syndrome (stss). stss was significantly more frequent in gas patients (10%) than  in gcs (4%), gbs (2%) and ggs (2%) patients. regression analyses showed that, despite a younger median age among gas patients, the probability of developing septic shock and mortality was significantly higher among gas patients than among gbs and ggs patients. these analyses showed no significant differences between gas and gcs infections. invasive infections caused by gas, gbs, gcs and ggs are still a major challenge for clinicians. continued epidemiological and microbiological surveillance is important to assess the development of these infections and to improve preventative strategies.

TI  == inter-species genetic movement may blur the epidemiology of streptococcal diseases in endemic regions.
AB  == streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (human group g streptococcus, ggs)  is generally regarded as a commensal organism but can cause a spectrum of human diseases very similar to that caused by s. pyogenes (group a streptococcus, gas). lateral acquisition of genes between these two phylogenetically closely related species is well documented. however, the extent and mechanisms of lateral acquisitions is not known. we report here genomic subtraction between a pathogenic ggs isolate and a community ggs isolate and analyses of the gene sequences unique to the pathovar. our results show that cross-species genetic transfers are common between ggs and two closely related human pathogens, gas and the group b streptococcus. we also demonstrate that mobile genetic elements, such as phages and transposons, play an important role in the ongoing inter-species transfers of genetic traits between extant organisms in the community. furthermore, lateral gene transfers between gas and ggs may occur more frequently in geographical regions of high gas endemicity. these observations may have important implications in understanding the epidemiology of streptococcal diseases in such regions.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of oral cephems against various clinically isolated strains and evaluation of efficacy based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics theory].
AB  == we compared the antimicrobial activity of commercially available oral cephem agents, cefaclor (ccl), cefroxadine (cxd), cefdinir (cfdn), cefixime (cfix), cefpodoxime (cpdx), cefteram (cftm), cefcapene (cfpn), and cefditoren (cdtr), against streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and esbl-producing bacteria isolated from clinical materials in kansai medical university hospital between 2002 and 2003. based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (pk/pd) theory, we determined the concentration of each agent at which the time above mic (tam) value was 40% or more, and calculated the rate of efficacy against each type of bacteria. in s. pneumoniae strains, the mic(50,80,90) values of cdtr were 0.25, 0.5, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, lower than those of the other agents, demonstrating the  most potent antimicrobial activity. however, the efficacy rate for cdtr calculated based on the pk/pd theory was 58.5%. cftm showed the highest efficacy  rate (66.1%). in h. influenzae strains, the antimicrobial activity of cdtr was most potent, followed by that of cftm and that of cfpn/cfix. the mic90 value of cdtr was lowest (0.25 microg/ml), followed by that of cftm (0.5 microg/ml). the efficacy rate for cdtr was 100%. this result supports that cdtr frequently eradicates h. influenzae. in e. coli strains, the mic90 values of the above agents, excluding ccl and cxd, ranged from 0.5 to 1 microg/ml. the antimicrobial  activity of cfix against k. pneumoniae was most potent, followed by that of cfdn/cpdx and that of cftm. in esbl-producing bacteria, most agents showed an mic90 value of more than 4 microg/ml. in s. agalactiae and s. pyogenes strains, all of the agents showed satisfactory mic values. in methi- cillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa) strains, cfdn and cxd showed a high efficacy rate, whereas the efficacy rates for the other agents were low. the frequent use of oral agents has increased the number of cephem-resistant bacteria. esbl-producing bacteria become highly resistant, and the presence or absence of response can be  readily evaluated. however, when a mutation of penicillin-binding protein (pbp) occurs, drug resistance is less marked. therefore, it is difficult to evaluate the treatment response in many cases. in s. pneumoniae strains, the efficacy rates for all of the agents were low in the evaluation using the pk/pd theory, suggesting that a dose higher than the standard dose should be established. thus, in the future, the efficacy should be evaluated based on the pk/pd theory, appropriate antimicrobial treatment should be administered, and the administration method that does not increase the number of resistant bacteria must be established.

TI  == characterization of a novel leucine-rich repeat protein antigen from group b streptococci that elicits protective immunity.
AB  == group b streptococci (gbs) usually behave as commensal organisms that asymptomatically colonize the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts of adults. however, gbs are also pathogens and the leading bacterial cause of life-threatening invasive disease in neonates. while the events leading to transmission and disease in neonates remain unclear, gbs carriage and level of colonization in the mother have been shown to be significant risk factors associated with invasive infection. surface antigens represent ideal vaccine targets for eliciting antibodies that can act as opsonins and/or inhibit colonization and invasion. using a genetic screen for exported proteins in gbs, we identified a gene, designated lrrg, that encodes a novel lpxtg anchored surface antigen containing leucine-rich repeat (lrr) motifs found in bacterial invasins and other members of the lrr protein family. southern blotting showed that lrrg was present in all gbs strains tested, representing the nine serotypes, and revealed the presence of an lrrg homologue in streptococcus pyogenes. recombinant lrrg protein was shown in vitro to adhere to epithelial cells in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that it may function as an adhesion factor in gbs. more importantly, immunization with recombinant lrrg elicited a strong immunoglobulin g response in cba/ca mice and protected against lethal challenge with virulent gbs. the data presented in this report suggest that this conserved  protein is a highly promising candidate antigen for use in a gbs vaccine.

TI  == regulation of virulence by a two-component system in group b streptococcus.
AB  == group b streptococcus (gbs) is frequently carried in the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract as a commensal organism, yet it has the potential to cause life-threatening infection in newborn infants, pregnant women, and individuals with chronic illness. regulation of virulence factor expression may affect whether gbs behaves as an asymptomatic colonizer or an invasive pathogen, but little is known about how such factors are controlled in gbs. we now report the characterization of a gbs locus that encodes a two-component regulatory system similar to csrrs (or covrs) in streptococcus pyogenes. inactivation of csrr, encoding the putative response regulator, in two unrelated wild-type strains of gbs resulted in a marked increase in production of beta-hemolysin/cytolysin and a striking decrease in production of camp factor, an unrelated cytolytic toxin. quantitative rna hybridization experiments revealed that these two phenotypes were associated with a marked increase and decrease in expression of the corresponding genes, cyle and cfb, respectively. the csrr mutant strains also displayed increased expression of scpb encoding c5a peptidase. similar, but less  marked, changes in gene expression were observed in csrs (putative sensor component) mutants, evidence that csrr and csrs constitute a functional two-component system. experimental infection studies in mice demonstrated reduced virulence of both csrr and csrs mutant strains relative to the wild type. together, these results indicate that csrrs regulates expression of multiple gbs  virulence determinants and is likely to play an important role in gbs pathogenesis.

TI  == surveillance of linezolid resistance in germany, 2001-2002.
AB  == a surveillance study was performed throughout germany from november 2001 to june  2002 to assess the prevalence of linezolid-resistant isolates among gram-positive bacteria from routine susceptibility data and to compare the in-vitro activity of linezolid to that of other antibacterial agents. each of 86 laboratories provided routine susceptibility data for 100 consecutive isolates. most laboratories (c. 60%) used the disk diffusion test. laboratories were also requested to send a representative sample of their isolates, as well as all isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid, to a reference laboratory for mic determination. susceptibility data for 8594 isolates were evaluated. sites of infection were skin and soft tissue (29.9%), upper and lower respiratory tract (19.1%), foreign body or catheter (10.5%), or urinary tract (9.8%). routine linezolid susceptibility data were reported for 6433 isolates. the prevalence of  linezolid resistance, as reported to the clinician, was 0.4% in staphylococcus aureus, 0.3% in staphylococcus epidermidis, 2.9% in enterococcus faecalis, 2.3% in enterococcus faecium, 1.4% in streptococcus pyogenes and 2.9% in streptococcus agalactiae. linezolid resistance was not detected in streptococcus pneumoniae or  in viridans group streptococci. sixty-nine of 115 isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid were retested, but none was resistant to linezolid. linezolid exhibited excellent in-vitro activity against representative isolates of the six most frequently encountered species (mic90, 1-2 mg/l). the prevalence of resistance to linezolid was very low in germany. organisms reported as linezolid-resistant should be retested, either in the same laboratory with an  alternative method or in a reference laboratory.

TI  == prevalence and mechanisms of erythromycin resistance in group a and group b streptococcus: implications for reporting susceptibility results.
AB  == increased rates of erythromycin resistance among group b streptococcus (gbs) and  group a streptococcus (gas) have been reported. cross-resistance to clindamycin may be present, depending on the mechanism of resistance. we determined the prevalence of macrolide-resistant determinants in gbs and gas isolates to guide the laboratory reporting of erythromycin and clindamycin susceptibility. susceptibilities were determined by the disk diffusion and broth microdilution methods. inducible and constitutive resistance to clindamycin was determined by the double-disk diffusion method. the presence of the ermtr, ermb, and mefa genes was confirmed by pcr. of the 338 gbs isolates, 55 (17%) were resistant to erythromycin, whereas 26 (8%) were resistant to clindamycin. the erm methylase gene was identified in 48 isolates, 22 of which had inducible resistance to clindamycin and 26 of which had constitutive resistance to clindamycin. the remaining seven resistant isolates had mefa. of the 593 gas isolates, 49 (8%) and 6 (1%) isolates were resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin, respectively. erythromycin resistance was due to mefa in 33 isolates, whereas 14 isolates had erm-mediated resistance (9 isolates had inducible resistance and 5 isolates had constitutive resistance). in our population, erythromycin resistance in gas was predominantly mediated by mefa and erythromycin resistance in gbs was predominantly mediated by erm. regional differences in mechanisms of resistance need to be taken into consideration when deciding whether to report clindamycin susceptibility results on the basis of in vitro test results. testing by the double-disk diffusion method would be an approach that could be used to address this issue, especially for gas.

TI  == covs/covr of group b streptococcus: a two-component global regulatory system involved in virulence.
AB  == in this study, we carried out a detailed structural and functional analysis of a  streptococcus agalactiae (gbs) two-component system which is orthologous to the covs/covr (csrs/csrr) regulatory system of streptococcus pyogenes. in gbs, covr and covs are part of a seven gene operon transcribed from two promoters that are  not regulated by covr. a deltacovsr mutant was found to display dramatic phenotypic changes such as increased haemolytic activity and reduced camp activity on blood agar. adherence of the deltacovsr mutant to epithelial cells was greatly increased and analysis by transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence at its surface of a fibrous extracellular matrix that might be involved in these intercellular interactions. however, the deltacovsr mutant was  unable to initiate growth in rpmi and its viability in human normal serum was greatly impaired. a major finding of this phenotypic analysis was that the covs/covr system is important for gbs virulence, as a 3 log increase of the ld(50) of the mutant strain was observed in the neonate rat sepsis model. the pleiotropic phenotype of the deltacovsr mutant is in full agreement with the large number of genes controlled by covs/covr as seen by expression profiling analysis, many of which encode potentially secreted or cell surface-associated proteins: 76 genes are repressed whereas 63 were positively regulated. covr was shown to bind directly to the regulatory regions of several of these genes and a  consensus covr recognition sequence was proposed using both dnase i footprinting  and computational analyses.

TI  == issag1 in streptococcal strains of human and animal origin.
AB  == the chromosomal region of streptococcus agalactiae harboring the c5a peptidase and the lmb genes displays the structure of a composite transposon. its presence  in a streptococcal strain is associated with the origin of this strain from a human host. in s. agalactiae it is flanked by two copies of the insertion element issag2, and the nucleotide sequence for a third is element (issag1) can be found  in this region. based on amino acid sequence similarity of the deduced transposase issag1 belongs to the is3 family. it is 1251 bp long and flanked by 37 bp imperfect inverted repeats. horizontal gene transfer among different bacterial species is facilitated by mobile genetic elements. to investigate if issag1 homologues are also present in other streptococcal species, various species of pyogenic streptococci from animal and human origin were analyzed by southern blot hybridization and pcr. among the different streptococcal species, multiple copies of an issag1 homologue could only be detected in s. dysgalactiae  subsp. dysgalactiae strains of animal origin. all of the s. agalactiae strains harbored only a single copy, that was always found in strains with the scpb-lmb composite transposon. a single copy of an issag1 homologue could also be detected in some of the s. pyogenes and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis strains. nucleotide sequencing of the is element in s. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae strains revealed several different variants. one of the variants showed the features of a regular is3 element. the other two variants that were observed displayed a 500-bp deletion and a mosaic structure composed of issag1 and issag2  homologues. this mosaic structure suggests that recombination and horizontal gene transfer events in s. dysgalactiae strains of bovine origin could have played a role in the assembly of the scpb-lmb composite transposon structure.

TI  == daptomycin - a novel antibiotic against gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == daptomycin is a novel member of a new class of antimicrobial agents used in treating resistant gram-positive infections. these infections are becoming more commonplace and treatment options are limited. at present, daptomycin is approved for use in the us for complicated skin and skin-structure infections that are a common complication of surgery, diabetic foot ulcers, and burns. the most common  causative organisms in these types of infections are staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and group c and g streptococci. traditionally, these infections have been treated with penicillin and cephalosporins, but resistance to these agents is widespread and increasing. of particular concern is the rapid increase in methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). the sentry antimicrobial surveillance programme reported that approximately 30% of s. aureus isolates from skin and skin-structure infections were mrsa. the standard treatment for mrsa infections is vancomycin but resistance to this agent is also developing. there is a continuing need for the development of new antibiotics with gram-positive activity, to combat multi-drug-resistant gram-positive infections.

TI  == immunization with c5a peptidase from either group a or b streptococci enhances clearance of group a streptococci from intranasally infected mice.
AB  == group a streptococci (s. pyogenes) are responsible for pharyngitis, impetigo and  several more serious diseases. emergence of toxic shock, and necrotizing fasciitis, associated with this pathogen over the past 10 years, has generated interest in development of a vaccine, which would prevent infections and potential serious complications. the highly conserved c5a peptidase that is expressed on the surface of group a streptococcus and other streptococcal species, associated with human infections, is a prime vaccine candidate. here, we report construction of an inactive form of the peptidase and test its potential to induce protection in mice from intranasal challenge with either serotype m1 and m49 strains of streptococci. mice were immunized by subcutaneous administration of recombinant proteins, mixed with alum and monophosphoryl lipid  a (mpl) adjuvants. control mice were vaccinated with tetanus toxoid in the same adjuvants. preparations of scpa protein were highly immunogenic in mice. antibody directed against protein from either group a (scpaw) or group b (scpbw) streptococci neutralized activity associated with both enzymes. streptococci were cleared from the oral-nasal mucosa of mice immunized with vaccine protein more rapidly than those immunized with tetanus toxoid. moreover, immunization with either protein enhanced clearance of group a streptococci from the lung. these results suggest that parenteral vaccination with scpbw protein will provide protection against infection by either group a or b streptococci.

TI  == [evaluation of prolex for the rapid identification of streptococci isolated in medical microbiology].
AB  == the need to rapidly identify streptococci responsible for acute infectious diseases has led to the development of agglutination techniques that are able to  identify streptococcal group antigens (a, b, c, d, f, and g) directly from primoculture colonies on blood agar. the prolex agglutination tests (pro-lab diagnostics, richmond hill, ontario, canada), distributed in france by i2a, have  been used for the determination of group antigens of 166 isolates of streptococci and enterococci previously identified in the national reference center for streptococci. the results obtained with the prolex reagents have permitted to correctly identify all pyogenic beta-hemolytic streptococci (23 streptococcus pyogenes, 21 streptococcus agalactiae, 33 streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis including 6 group c and 27 group g, and 5 streptococcus porcinus including 4 group b). four differences between unexpected agglutinations (a or f) and species identifications have been obtained. these differences were observed for four non-hemolytic isolates of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus gordonii,  streptococcus infantarius, and streptococcus suis. the anti-d reagent has been of value as a marker for isolates of enterococci. thus, these results confirm the abilities of these agglutination tests for the grouping of beta-hemolytic streptococci. moreover, the use of prolex has the advantage to be rapid because of the non-enzymatic but chemical extraction of streptococcal antigens.

TI  == zebrafish as a model host for streptococcal pathogenesis.
AB  == streptococcal pathogens continue to evade concerted efforts to determine clear-cut virulence mechanisms, although numerous genes have been implicated in pathogenesis. a single species can infect a diversity of tissues, suggesting the  expression of specific virulence factors based on the local tissue environment or stage of infection. in an effort to identify the interactions that occur between  the host and pathogen that lead to activation of virulence mechanisms and contribute to specific streptococcal disease states, we have developed a unique animal model, the zebrafish (danio rerio), to characterize specific virulence mechanisms utilized within various tissues in vivo. we are using this model host  to study infection by two streptococcal species that represent two forms of streptococcal disease: a natural pathogen of fish and humans, streptococcus iniae and a human-specific pathogen, streptococcus pyogenes. s. iniae primarily causes  a fatal systemic disease in the zebrafish following intra-muscular injection, with similar pathologies to that seen in human infections caused by streptococcus agalactiae and s. pneumoniae. while the fatal infection by s. pyogenes causes a locally spreading necrotic disease confined to the muscle with pathology similar  to what is observed in a human infection of necrotizing fasciitis. by studying pathogens that are virulent for both fish and humans and that mediate disease states in the zebrafish that are identical to those found in human streptococcal  infections, we will be able to identify common virulence strategies shared by a number of gram-positive pathogens.

AB  == the development of bacterial disease has been likened to a 'molecular arms race', in which the host tries to eliminate the bacteria, while the bacteria try to survive in the host. although most bacteria do not cause disease, some cause serious human infection in a large proportion of encounters. between these two extremes are bacteria that can coexist with humans in a carriage state but, under appropriate circumstances, cause disease. the streptococci exemplify this group of organisms, and by studying them we can begin to address why bacteria cause such a wide spectrum of disease.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of the peptide deformylase inhibitor bb-83698.
AB  == objectives: bb-83698 is a peptide deformylase inhibitor currently in clinical trials in europe. the purpose of this study was to provide additional susceptibility data from clinical isolates, including drug-resistant strains. methods: the in vitro activities of bb-83698 and comparators were determined against 281 streptococci, 154 staphylococcus aureus, 110 haemophilus influenzae and 50 moraxella catarrhalis strains selected for their resistance phenotypes. broth microdilution mics and mbcs were determined according to nccls guidelines.  results: the mic90s were 0.25-0.5 mg/l for s. pneumoniae, including penicillin-,  erythromycin-, levofloxacin- and multidrug-resistant strains. the mic90s for streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae were 0.12 mg/l and for viridans streptococci, the mic90 was 0.5 mg/l. against s. aureus, including oxacillin- and levofloxacin-resistant strains, and vancomycin-intermediate strains, the mic90 was 8 mg/l. against beta-lactamase-negative and -positive h. influenzae, the mic90s were 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively, and against both beta-lactamase-negative and -positive m. catarrhalis the mic90 was 0.12 mg/l. in  mbc studies, the ratio of mbc/mic was 1:1 or 2:1 against 31% of s. pneumoniae, 33% of s. aureus, 63% of h. influenzae and 9% of m. catarrhalis. conclusions: although bb-83698 has reduced in vitro activity against h. influenzae, it is a potent antimicrobial with excellent activity against streptococci and moraxella.

TI  == daptomycin.
AB  == daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibacterial with rapid in vitro activity against gram-positive cocci. it is approved for use in patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssis) caused by specified gram-positive cocci. in vitro, daptomycin was active against staphylococcus aureus (including meticillin-resistant strains), streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, group c and g beta-haemolytic streptococci and vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis.  bactericidal activity in vitro was rapid and concentration dependent. in two randomised, investigator-blinded, multicentre trials in patients with csssis, intravenous daptomycin 4 mg/kg once daily was as effective as standard therapy (intravenous semi-synthetic penicillin 4-12 g/day or vancomycin 1 g 12-hourly). clinical success rates assessed 6-20 days after treatment end were 82.1% in daptomycin recipients and 82.9% in recipients of standard therapy (pooled data).  in patients with csssis, the adverse event profiles of daptomycin and vancomycin  were similar. creatine phosphokinase (cpk) levels increased in 2.8% of daptomycin recipients and 1.8% of patients who received standard therapy; only one daptomycin recipient (0.2%) experienced increased cpk levels and muscle symptoms  that were not associated with any comorbid factors.

TI  == construction of a gbs-gas dna subtraction library allows discovery of previously  unidentified gbs genes and rapid location of unique regions on the gbs chromosome.
AB  == a subtraction library of group b streptococcus (gbs) strain o9or with gas chromosomal dna (strain sf370) was constructed and more than 100 plasmid clones sequenced. dna sequences of the plasmid inserts were analyzed using the blast gene search. most inserts had little or no homology to gas chromosomal dna and 26 clones from the library had no gene homologues in the gene bank. the majority of  genes discovered represented house keeping gbs genes, but several could be considered as possible virulence factors. inserts from 21 clones were labeled and used as probes for hybridization with gbs dna fragments separated by pulsed field electrophoresis. a genetic map of gbs strain o9or was constructed.

TI  == rpob gene sequence-based identification of aerobic gram-positive cocci of the genera streptococcus, enterococcus, gemella, abiotrophia, and granulicatella.
AB  == we developed a new molecular tool based on rpob gene (encoding the beta subunit of rna polymerase) sequencing to identify streptococci. we first sequenced the complete rpob gene for streptococcus anginosus, s. equinus, and abiotrophia defectiva. sequences were aligned with these of s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. pneumoniae available in genbank. using an in-house analysis program (svarap),  we identified a 740-bp variable region surrounded by conserved, 20-bp zones and,  by using these conserved zones as pcr primer targets, we amplified and sequenced  this variable region in an additional 30 streptococcus, enterococcus, gemella, granulicatella, and abiotrophia species. this region exhibited 71.2 to 99.3% interspecies homology. we therefore applied our identification system by pcr amplification and sequencing to a collection of 102 streptococci and 60 bacterial isolates belonging to other genera. amplicons were obtained in streptococci and bacillus cereus, and sequencing allowed us to make a correct identification of streptococci. molecular signatures were determined for the discrimination of closely related species within the s. pneumoniae-s. oralis-s. mitis group and the s. agalactiae-s. difficile group. these signatures allowed us to design a s. pneumoniae-specific pcr and sequencing primer pair.

AB  == the in vitro activity of abt773, a new ketolide, was assessed against a collection (518) of well-characterised gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens  and compared with that of other appropriate drugs. abt773 was active (mic-90=0.03 mg/l) against the staphylococci tested which included macrolide-resistant but clindamycin susceptible organisms. streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae were also inhibited (mic-90 range: <0.0075-0.5mg/l) irrespective of their antibiotic resistance phenotype. enterococcus faecalis was sensitive to abt773 with the exception of vana mutants. e. faecium showed poor susceptibility  to abt773. the activity of the new ketolide against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis was comparable with that of the most potent drugs tested. abt773 displays the characteristics of a promising agent that deserves to be introduced as the empirical therapy of infections caused by the bacterial species tested here, even if they are multiply resistant.

TI  == l-ficolin specifically binds to lipoteichoic acid, a cell wall constituent of gram-positive bacteria, and activates the lectin pathway of complement.
AB  == the lectin pathway of complement is activated when a carbohydrate recognition complex and associated serine proteases binds to the surface of a pathogen. three recognition subcomponents have been shown to form active initiation complexes: mannan-binding lectin (mbl), l-ficolin, and h-ficolin. the importance of mbl in antimicrobial host defense is well recognized, but the role of the ficolins remains largely undefined. this report shows that l-ficolin specifically binds to lipoteichoic acid (lta), a cell wall component found in all gram-positive bacteria. immobilized lta from staphylococcus aureus binds l-ficolin complexes from sera, and these complexes initiate lectin pathway-dependent c4 turnover. c4  activation correlates with serum l-ficolin concentration, but not with serum mbl  levels. l-ficolin binding and corresponding levels of c4 turnover were observed on lta purified from other clinically important bacteria, including streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae. none of the lta preparations bound mbl, h-ficolin, or the classical pathway recognition molecule, c1q.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial susceptibility for czop were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen species (2,363 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the  clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis  (msse), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), streptococcus milleri group and peptostreptococcus spp. the antibacterial activity of czop either against mssa or msse was preferable (mic90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/ml) and comparable to those of other cephems. czop was also effective  on mrse (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) but not on mrsa. czop and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop  against e. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (cpr; mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) and higher than those of other cephems. no antibacterial activity  of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, like other drugs. the antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and cpr (mic90: < or = 0.063 microgram/ml), and, against s. agalactiae,  was also preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml). czop indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against pssp, pisp, or prsp (mic90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. milleri group was also preferable, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint mic of czop was 95.9% in mrsa, 93.5% in prsp, 63.3% in pisp, 35.8% in s. haemolyticus, 27.9% in e. faecalis, and 13.3% mrse. those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (cfpm), but e. faecalis showed 91.2% for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. in correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of prsp was not inhibited at breakpoint mic either czop or  cfpm while 69.2% at breakpoint mic either czop or ceftazidime. in conclusion, the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. a decline in the sensitivities of s. saprophyticus, s. milleri group, pisp, and prsp to czop, however, was suggested.

TI  == heat shock treatment increases the frequency of loss of an erythromycin resistance-encoding transposable element from the chromosome of lactobacillus crispatus chcc3692.
AB  == a 3,165-bp chromosomally integrated transposon, designatedtn3692, of the gram-positive strain lactobacillus crispatus chcc3692 contains an erm(b) gene conferring resistance to erythromycin at concentrations of up to 250 micrograms/ml. loss of this resistance can occur spontaneously, but the rate is substantially increased by heat shock treatment. heat shock treatment at 60 degrees c resulted in an almost 40-fold increase in the frequency of erythromycin-sensitive cells (erythromycin mic, 0.047 micrograms/ml). the phenotypic change was followed by a dramatic increase in transcription of the transposase gene and the concomitant loss of an approximately 2-kb dna fragment carrying the erm(b) gene from the 3,165-bp erm transposon. in cells that were not subjected to heat shock, transcription of the transposase gene was not detectable. the upstream sequence of the transposase gene did not show any homology to known heat shock promoters in the gene data bank. significant homology (>99%) was observed between the erythromycin resistance-encoding gene from l. crispatus chcc3692 and the erm(b) genes from other gram-positive bacteria, such as streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus  faecium, and lactobacillus reuteri, which strongly indicates a common origin of the erm(b) gene for these species. the transposed dna element was not translocated to other parts of the genome of chcc3692, as determining by southern blotting, pcr analysis, and dna sequencing. no other major aberrations were observed, as judged by colony morphology, growth performance of the strain, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. these observations suggest that heat shock treatment could be used as a tool for the removal of unwanted antibiotic resistance genes harbored in transposons flanked by insertion sequence elements or transposases in lactic acid bacteria used for animal and human food production.

TI  == molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pre25 of enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  == plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to e. faecalis jh2-2, lactococcus lactis bu2, and listeria innocua l19. its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the  largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (plasmid 46 (2001) 170). the gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pip501 of streptococcus agalactiae. erythromycin resistance is due to a 23s ribosomal rna methyl transferase, again as found in pip501 (ermb). the aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon tn5405 of staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. aureus, campylobacter coli, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium difficile. pre25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pip501. of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsb, trac, trsf, trsj, and trsl). the enterococcal part is joined into the pip501 part by insertion elements is1216v of e. faecium tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of is1062 (e. faecalis) and is1485 (e. faecium). pre25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.

TI  == complement resistance mechanisms of streptococci.
AB  == group a streptococcus (gas, streptococcus pyogenes), group b streptococcus (gbs,  streptococcus agalactiae) and pneumococcus (streptococcus pneumoniae) are all human pathogens that cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. these related species cause different spectra of infections spanning from trivial upper respiratory tract or skin infections to septic and severe diseases. in order to cause deep infections and survive in the human body the bacteria must evade the immune system. complement is an important part of innate immunity both as an opsonizing and membrane destructing cascade and as an effector system of antibodies. in this review, we describe the complement resistance mechanisms of the three clinically most important streptococcal species, groups a and b streptococci and pneumococcus. the complement evasion mechanisms of these three species are analogous, yet different from one another. several strains of all three species express molecules (m-proteins, bac or beta, pspc) that acquire host fluid-phase complement regulators factor h or c4b binding protein to their surfaces. groups a and b streptococci also secrete proteins and/or enzymes that inhibit the activation of the complement system or chemotaxis caused by the complement activation products. even though a lot is known about the immune evasion by streptococci, the high morbidity and mortality associated with infections caused by streptococci and the need for efficient vaccines warrant further studies on the streptococcal molecules mediating complement resistance.

TI  == small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  == taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of gram-positive and gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus  pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, helicobacter pylori, chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, and campylobacter jejuni. large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two s. aureus libraries, highly representative. consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the  identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. the use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.

AB  == the in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29  species isolated in the us and canada between 1997 and 1999. based upon minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. against enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general,  displayed weak activity with only proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of gram-negative non-enterobacteriaceae including haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against burkholderia cepacia, pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime against clinical isolates in 2000 and 2001].
AB  == as the post-marketing surveillance of cefpodoxime proxetil (banan), mics of cefpodoxime (cpdx, an active form of banan) against 1090 clinical isolates of 22  species from 15 medical institutions all over japan from june 2000 to march 2001  were measured using the broth microdilution method approved by the japanese society of chemotherapy and compared with those of oral cephem antibacterials, cefaclor, cefdinir, cefditoren, and cefcapene. in this study, remarkable change in the activity of cpdx was observed in streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus  influenzae compared with the susceptibility in the studies before banan was launched. this cause is considered to be the increase in the incidence of the following resistant strains: penicillin-intermediate s. pneumoniae (47.3%), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp, 15.1%), and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (blnar) h. influenzae (24.0%), which were scarcely isolated  in 1989 when banan was launched. other tested drugs also exhibited low activity against these resistant strains. however, cpdx showed comparatively good activity with mic90 of 2 micrograms/ml against prsp. against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and moraxella catarrhalis, cpdx also showed comparatively good activity with mic90 of < or = 4 micrograms/ml, which was almost equal to that in the studies before its  marketing. against quinolones-resistant neisseria gonorrhoeae, cpdx showed excellent activity with mic90 of 0.5 microgram/ml. against members of the family  enterobacteriaceae except for citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii, cpdx showed good activity. however, in escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. proteus spp., and providencia spp., there are some high-resistant strains to all tested drugs including cpdx. against peptostreptococcus spp., mic90 of cpdx was 8 micrograms/ml and its mic range was  widely distributed from 0.03 to 32 micrograms/ml, which were similar to those in  the studies before its marketing. in this study, cpdx showed the decrease in the  activity against several species as did other drugs tested, but against most of species tested, cpdx maintained good activity. furthermore, it is necessary to pay much attention to the trend of resistant strains.

AB  == background: limited data exist on infective endocarditis (ie) due to streptococcus milleri (sm) or beta-hemolytic streptococci (bhs). because bhs and  sm share some physiologic and pathogenic properties, we wondered whether ie caused by these streptococci might present similarities. methods: through a nationwide retrospective study in france, the medical and microbiologic charts of adults with definite sm or bhs ie observed between january 1, 1991, and december  31, 1996, in university and general hospitals were reviewed. results: fifty-six patients had bhs ie (33 men and 23 women; median age, 59 years; range, 18-91 years) and 29 had sm ie (18 men and 11 women; median age, 66 years; range, 37-97  years). the bhs group tended to have more underlying medical conditions (46%) and fewer previous cardiopathies (48%) than the sm group (28% and 71%, respectively). multivariate analysis showed that a longer median time of ie evolution before diagnosis and identification of the presumed portal of entry were independently associated with sm ie (p<.01). extracardiac complications were more frequent in the bhs group (55%) than in the sm group (39%). comparison of echocardiographic findings between the 2 groups did not establish any statistically significant difference. thirty-six patients (64%) in the bhs group and 18 (62%) in the sm group underwent valve replacement. overall, mortality was 27% for the bhs group and 14% for the sm group. for all patients, multivariate analysis retained older  age as the only significant risk factor for death (p =.01). conclusion: compared  with sm ie, bhs ie occurs in younger patients with more underlying diseases and fewer underlying cardiopathies and has a more aggressive presentation and evolution.

TI  == genome sequence of streptococcus agalactiae, a pathogen causing invasive neonatal disease.
AB  == streptococcus agalactiae is a commensal bacterium colonizing the intestinal tract of a significant proportion of the human population. however, it is also a pathogen which is the leading cause of invasive infections in neonates and causes septicaemia, meningitis and pneumonia. we sequenced the genome of the serogroup iii strain nem316, responsible for a fatal case of septicaemia. the genome is 2 211 485 base pairs long and contains 2118 protein coding genes. fifty-five per cent of the predicted genes have an ortholog in the streptococcus pyogenes genome, representing a conserved backbone between these two streptococci. among the genes in s. agalactiae that lack an ortholog in s. pyogenes, 50% are clustered within 14 islands. these islands contain known and putative virulence genes, mostly encoding surface proteins as well as a number of genes related to mobile elements. some of these islands could therefore be considered as pathogenicity islands. compared with other pathogenic streptococci, s. agalactiae shows the unique feature that pathogenicity islands may have an important role in virulence acquisition and in genetic diversity.

TI  == involvement of lsp, a member of the lrai-lipoprotein family in streptococcus pyogenes, in eukaryotic cell adhesion and internalization.
AB  == three open reading frames (orfs) were identified by a genome walking strategy in  the genomes of serotype m49 group a streptococcal (gas) strains cs101 and 591. these orfs were located between the mga core regulon and the dipeptide permease operon. the deduced amino acid (aa) sequences contained signature sequences indicative of a lipoprotein (306 aa), an intracellular protein (823 aa), and a secreted peptide (66 aa), respectively. orf1 (named lsp for lipoprotein of streptococcus pyogenes) and orf2 exhibited a high degree of homology to the lmb/orf2 genes of s. agalactiae (b. spellerberg et al., infect. immun. 67:871-878, 1999). the three orfs were found to be present in each of the 27 gas  serotype strains tested. transcription analysis revealed a polycistronic lsp/orf2 and a monocistronic orf3 message that were detected primarily at the transition from exponential to stationary growth phase. lsp and orf2 mutants, orf2- and orf3-luciferase reporter fusions, and antiserum against recombinant lsp were produced to examine the biological role of these genes. although high zn(2+) and  cu(2+) ion concentrations decreased lsp operon expression, lsp did not transport  divalent cations as described for other lrai-type operons. the lsp mutant had reduced fibronectin binding. although no direct binding of lsp to fibronectin could be demonstrated, the lsp mutant showed decreased transcription of prtf2 encoding the fibronectin-binding protein f2. both the lsp and orf2 mutants showed decreased laminin binding. adherence to and internalization into a549 epithelial  cells of both mutants was reduced without a detectable effect on eukaryotic cell  viability. the transcription of a number of virulence factors was altered in the  lsp mutants and orf2 mutants. the changes in laminin binding and eukaryotic cell  internalization could be explained by changes in transcription of speb (cysteine  protease) and/or the global regulators mga, csrrs, and nra.

TI  == antibody to streptococcal cysteine proteinase as a seromarker of group a streptococcal (streptococcus pyogenes) infections.
AB  == serological tests are commonly employed to aid the diagnosis of streptococcus pyogenes infections, particularly when non-suppurative sequelae are suspected. conventional laboratory practice is to measure antibody levels to various combinations of the extracellular group a streptococcus (gas) antigens streptolysin o (slo), dnase b, streptokinase and hyaluronidase. antibody to the extracellular cysteine proteinase streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin b (spe b) and  its precursor zymogen is also produced in response to gas infections. an indirect hemagglutination test for antibody to zymogen/spe b was established and evaluated in serum samples from 168 patients with proven (n = 27) or suspected gas (n = 141) infections, which were also screened for antibodies using the 4 conventional tests. for comparison, sera from 56 patients infected with a variety of other pathogens, as well as sera from 16 patients infected with either s. agalactiae or s. pneumoniae and 34 sera from healthy subjects, were tested. statistical analysis confirmed that antibody to zymogen/spe b is a serological marker that can discriminate gas infections. it can be ranked with the anti-slo titer, currently the most widely used test, as a marker of an antecedent gas infection.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci: report from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (1997-2000).
AB  == susceptibility patterns of 15 antimicrobial agents were assessed for 3,400 isolates of beta-hemolytic (betahs) and viridans group (vgs) streptococci in the  four regions of the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program: asia-pacific (apac), europe (eu), latin america (la) and north america (na). in 1997 through 2000, sentry program monitors tested strains by reference broth microdilution methods and results were interpreted using national committee for clinical laboratory standards criteria. among the betahs processed, 81.9% of strains were  either streptococcus pyogenes (n = 650) or s. agalactiae (n = 1,190). the vgs were generally classified as unspeciated alpha-hemolytic streptococci (n = 512; 44%) or s. mitis (n = 254; 22%). seven quinolones, two beta-lactams, erythromycin (er), clindamycin (cm), quinupristin/dalfopristin (q/d), vancomycin (va), teicoplanin (tp) and linezolid (lz) were tested. rank order of susceptibility for betahs isolates was: ceftriaxone (ctx) = q/d = va = tp = lz (100.0%) > gatifloxacin (gati) = trovafloxacin (trov, 99.8%) > levofloxacin (levo; 99.7%) >  penicillin (pen; 99.3%) > grepafloxacin (grepa; 97.4%) > cm (94.4%) > er (85.5%). er versus betahs had the highest mic(90) values (2 microg/ml) and the lowest susceptibility rates across all regions (range, 81.4% in na to 97.3% in la). among the vgs, susceptibility rank order was: va = tp = lz (100.0%) > q/d (99.1%) > gati = levo = trova (98.0%) > grepa (96.5%) > ctx (92.8%) > cm (90.3%) > pen (68.6%) > er (64.5%). macrolide resistance in both streptococcal species groups of the m-phenotype was highest in the americas, with erm-patterns predominating in eu and apac regions. bms284756 among the monitored new agents showed a four- to eight-fold greater potency versus these streptococcal isolates when compared to the other six tested quinolones. like streptococcus pneumoniae, these other streptococci appear to have acquired numerous resistances and require continued surveillance to direct adequate therapies.

TI  == genetic bases and medical relevance of capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis in pathogenic streptococci.
AB  == many streptococci are human and/or animal pathogens and the frequent cause of life-threatening diseases. among various streptococcal virulence factors, capsular polysaccharides (cps) are recognized as essential to prevent phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils. in the last decade, an impressive advance on the knowledge of the genetic bases underlying capsule formation has been achieved. the capsular gene cluster driving the formation of the cp of streptococcus pyogenes and other hyaluronate-producing streptococci, represents one of the simplest cases of gene organization to synthesize a capsule. a more complex situation has been found in streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus suis, and other streptococci. on the whole, there exists a direct relationship between the structural and chemical complexity of the repeating unit of the polysaccharide and the number of genes found in the corresponding capsular locus. streptococcal vaccines, either polysaccharide or conjugate, are currently being tested in clinical trials to overcome the rise of  worldwide antibiotic resistance, although, for different reasons, none of these vaccines are expected to provide the required full coverage in a near future. this concern has prompted to explore alternative possibilities with an improved therapeutic potential against streptococcal diseases.

AB  == objective: to evaluate the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin, against 732 clinical strains recently isolated in italy. methods: susceptibility tests were performed according to nccls-guided mic methodology. pathogens included in the evaluation included 108 staphylococcus aureus isolates, 124 coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates, 158 streptococcus pyogenes isolates, 30 streptococcus agalactiae isolates, 30 b-hemolytic streptococcal isolates, 18 streptococcus sanguis isolates, 80 streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 69 enterococcal isolates, 40 haemophilus influenzae isolates, 30 moraxella catarrhalis isolates and, finally, 30 gram-positive and 25 gram-negative anaerobes. results: quinupristin/dalfopristin  inhibited staphylococcus aureus and other staphylococcus spp., irrespective of their oxacillin or erythromycin resistance phenotypes. similarly, streptococci were fully inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin. enterococcus faecalis was not  included in the spectrum of this streptogramin, while isolates of enterococcus faecium were inhibited by the new compound. respiratory pathogens such as h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin as well as all gram-negative anaerobes tested. conclusions: these findings suggest a putative role for quinupristin/dalfopristin in the empirical treatment of severe  nosocomial and community-acquired infections caused by pathogens often displaying resistance to multiple antibiotics. this drug may provide an alternative to glycopeptide compounds.

AB  == a new sample preparation method was developed for fresh, whole-cell gram-positive bacteria to be analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi tof ms). with fresh, whole-cell gram-negative bacteria of the enterobacteriaceae family, we had previously achieved spectra consisting of >50 peaks and mass ranges of 2-25 kda. because similar spectral quantity could not be achieved for gram-positive bacteria, using this same protocol, we investigated an alternative approach that focuses on the thick peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall. gram-positive bacteria were incubated with 0.05-0.5 mg/ml lysozyme for 30 min prior to being analyzed by maldi tof ms.  lysozyme is an enzymatically stable, 14-kda protein that specifically cleaves between peptidoglycan disaccharide subunits. a significant increase in overall number of peaks (>50) in the 2-14 kda range was observed without interference from the presence of lysozyme. we show that for four different species (staphylococcus aureus, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, and s. agalactiae) reproducible subset of peaks were found within spectra from a reference strain and two unrelated clinical isolates. the data suggests that this sample preparation may be useful for increasing the overall number of peaks within spectra for subsequent development of bacterial identification strategies.

TI  == group a streptococcal puerperal sepsis preceded by positive surveillance cultures.
AB  == background: screening of pregnant women for vaginal and rectal carriage of group  b streptococci may also identify group a streptococcal carriers. the clinical significance of prenatal group a streptococcal carriage is unknown. cases: two women developed group a streptococcal puerperal sepsis after delivery at one hospital 15 months apart. the first patient required hysterectomy and suffered complications including subcapsular hepatic hematoma, pleural effusion, and prolonged ileus. she recovered after a 35-day hospitalization. the second patient had endometritis and recovered. both had had group a streptococci isolated from vaginal and rectal cultures taken for prenatal group b streptococcal screening. the acute sepsis isolates were both m-type 28, but pulsed-field gel electrophoresis determined that the strains were unrelated. conclusions: finding  group a streptococci on prenatal culture may presage serious postpartum infection.

TI  == an in vitro study of antibacterial properties of the cervical mucus plug in pregnancy.
AB  == objective: to evaluate whether cervical mucus plugs are antibacterial in vitro. study design: cervical mucus plugs from 56 healthy women in labor were studied by 2 different antimicrobial assays: (1) analysis of the inhibition by the cervical  mucus plug of several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by overlaying the  cervical mucus plug onto an agar plate with imbedded bacteria, and (2) determination of the antibacterial property of the cervical mucus plug material by radial diffusion assay with group b streptococcus and escherichia coli. results: in the agar overlay assay, there was complete inhibition of clinical isolates of staphylococcus saprophyticus, e coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa and  patient-variable partial-to-complete inhibition of enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae. in the radial diffusion assay, cervical mucus plugs had activity toward group b streptococcus equivalent to 0.075 microg/ml of gentamicin and toward e coli equivalent to 0.5 microg/ml of gentamicin. conclusion: a low-molecular substance  with antibacterial activity in the cervical mucus plug may protect the fetus against ascending infections.

TI  == horizontal gene transfer and host specificity of beta-haemolytic streptococci: the role of a putative composite transposon containing scpb and lmb.
AB  == beta-haemolytic streptococci are important human and animal pathogens: their genetic traits that are associated with the ability to infect human hosts remain, however, unclear. the surface protein, lmb, mediates the adherence of streptococcus agalactiae to human laminin. for further analysis of the corresponding gene, the adjacent genomic regions were sequenced. lmb is localized on a putative composite transposon of 16 kb and is flanked by two copies of a novel insertion sequence element (issag2). it harbours the genes scpb and lmb, which are 98% identical with the respective genes of streptococcus pyogenes. analysis of the distribution of these genes and issag2 among 131 streptococcal strains revealed that all of the human isolates, but only 20% (12 of 61) of the animal isolates, contained scpb and lmb or their homologues. to investigate if the putative transposon can be mobilized, an erythromycin resistance marker was incorporated into the lmb gene of s. agalactiae. screening for mutant strains with a regained susceptibility for erythromycin identified strains with a deletion of scpb, lmb, and one copy of issag2. we hypothesize that a horizontal gene transfer caused the exchange of scpb and lmb and that the ability of s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae and group c and g streptococcal strains to colonize or infect human hosts is dependent on their presence.

TI  == necrotizing fasciitis.
AB  == necrotizing fasciitis is a devestating condition which has been recognized for several years. in north america a recent increase of cases has led to much media  attention and public fear. necrotizing fasciitis may occur as a consequence of infection with streptococcus pyogenes or as a result of a polymicrobial synergistic infection caused by aerobic, anaerobic, gram positive and gram negative organisms, often in postoperative patients. necrotizing fasciitis caused by streptococcus pyogenes is mediated by superantigens. the management of necrotizing fasciitis requires a high index of suspicion for diagnosis followed by antimicrobial therapy and early surgical intervention. in cases caused by streptococcus pyogenes with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, intravenous immunoglobulin may be of benefit.

TI  == streptococcal iga-binding proteins bind in the calpha 2-calpha 3 interdomain region and inhibit binding of iga to human cd89.
AB  == certain pathogenic bacteria express surface proteins that bind to the fc part of  human iga or igg. these bacterial proteins are important as immunochemical tools  and model systems, but their biological function is still unclear. here, we describe studies of three streptococcal proteins that bind iga: the sir22 and arp4 proteins of streptococcus pyogenes and the unrelated beta protein of group b streptococcus. analysis of iga domain swap and point mutants indicated that two loops at the calpha2/calpha3 domain interface are critical for binding of the streptococcal proteins. this region is also used in binding the human iga receptor cd89, an important mediator of iga effector function. in agreement with  this finding, the three iga-binding proteins and a 50-residue iga-binding peptide derived from sir22 blocked the ability of iga to bind cd89. further, the arp4 protein inhibited the ability of iga to trigger a neutrophil respiratory burst via cd89. thus, we have identified residues on iga-fc that play a key role in binding of different streptococcal iga-binding proteins, and we have identified a mechanism by which a bacterial iga-binding protein may interfere with iga effector function.

AB  == the r28 protein of group a streptococcus (gas) and the rib protein of group b streptococcus (gbs) are surface molecules that elicit protective immunity to experimental infection. these proteins are members of the same family and cross-react immunologically. in spite of extensive amino acid residue identity, the cross-reactivity between r28 and rib was found to be limited, as shown by analysis with highly purified proteins and specific antisera. nevertheless, immunization of mice with purified r28 conferred protection against lethal infection with rib-expressing gbs strains, and immunization with rib conferred protection against r28-expressing gas. thus, r28 and rib elicited cross-protective immunity. characterization of many clinical gas and gbs isolates expressing r28 or rib, respectively, indicated that most of them expressed proteins similar to those of the reference strains. analysis of these data suggests that cross-protection may influence the outcome of natural infections with r28-expressing gas and rib-expressing gbs.

AB  == the activity of moxifloxacin, a novel 8-methoxyquinolone, was evaluated against 1,218 respiratory pathogens isolated in nine spanish hospitals and was compared with ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefuroxime, erythromycin and clarithromycin. moxifloxacin exhibited an excellent  in vitro activity against most tested isolates with mic90 values of 0.25 mg/l for streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci; 0.12 mg/l for streptococcus pyogenes; 0.25 mg/l for streptococcus agalactiae; 0.06 and 4 mg/l for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, respectively; 0.06 mg/l for haemophilus influenzae and 0.12 mg/l for moraxella catarrhalis. moxifloxacin susceptibility rates were not affected by penicillin resistance in s. pneumoniae and s. viridans, by the betalactamase production in h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis or by macrolide resistance. moxifloxacin was twice as active as sparfloxacin and four to sixteen times more active than ciprofloxacin against  gram-positive isolates. sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were slightly more active  than moxifloxacin when tested against h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis isolates.  the microbiological data obtained confirm that moxifloxacin is a promising antimicrobial agent for treating respiratory tract infections.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, moxifloxacin, and trovafloxacin against erythromycin-susceptible and -resistant streptococci.
AB  == the in vitro activities of the new agents linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, moxifloxacin, and trovafloxacin were determined and compared with those of penicillin, clindamycin, and four macrolides against 53 erythromycin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, 117 s. pyogenes (64 erythromycin-susceptible and 53 -resistant), and 101 s. agalactiae (53 erythromycin-susceptible and 48 -resistant) isolates. differentiation of macrolide resistance phenotypes was performed by the double-disk method. the genetic basis for macrolide resistance in 52 strains was also determined. the m phenotype was found in 84.9, 6.3, and 1.9% of s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. pneumoniae isolates, respectively. these strains were susceptible to miocamycin and clindamycin. strains with the inducible phenotype accounted for 27.1% of s. agalactiae isolates and 9.4% each of s. pyogenes and s. pneumoniae isolates. all erythromycin-resistant isolates were also resistant to the 14- and 15-membered macrolides tested. strains with all three phenotypes were susceptible to </=2 microgram of linezolid per ml. quinupristin-dalfopristin exhibited good in vitro activity against all strains, irrespective of their resistance to erythromycin (mics at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited [mic(90)s], 0.2 to 1 microgram/ml). against the erythromycin-resistant s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae strains, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin were the most active agents (mic(90)s, 0.1 microgram/ml). the new antimicrobials evaluated may be alternative agents to treat infections caused by  macrolide-resistant as well as macrolide-susceptible streptococci.

TI  == use of pcr with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == we have designed a universal pcr capable of amplifying a portion of the 16s rrna  gene of eubacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. the sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most pcr products generated by haeiii digestion were different. pcr products from s. aureus and s. epidermidis could not be digested by haeiii but yielded different patterns when they were digested with mnli. pcr products from s. pneumoniae, e. faecium, and e. faecalis yielded the same haeiii digestion pattern but could be differentiated by alui digestion. pcr  products from e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and e. cloacae also had the  same haeiii digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with ddei  or bstbi. this universal pcr could detect as few as 10 e. coli or 250 s. aureus organisms. compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal pcr for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. these results suggest that this universal pcr coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.

TI  == semmelweis: the combat against puerperal fever.
AB  == groups a and b streptococci are of great significance in the history of obstetrics. group a streptococci were a great threat to the puerperium, especially in the 19th century, when homebirth was replaced by institutional birth in lying-in hospitals. the history of the rise and fall of puerperal fever  is indeed a tragedy. some people, like semmelweis, who brought new and important  evidence based findings were not believed by their fellow obstetricians, an attitude that spoiled thousands of innocent lives. even today group a streptococci, though seldom, may be the cause of puerperal sepsis. group b streptococci are widespread and may cause sepsis and important lifelong morbidity or mortality of the newborn. obstetricians today try to establish cost-effective  prophylactic measures during labor to prevent these neonatal infections.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin compared with other antimicrobial agents against recent clinical isolates of streptococci.
AB  == this study investigated the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) against 50 recent clinical isolates of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and viridans streptococci using the microdilution method. this activity was compared with that of the quinolone agents ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, trovafloxacin and grepafloxacin, and with that of penicillin, ampicillin, clarithromycin and azithromycin. gemifloxacin was significantly more  potent than the other quinolones tested. its potency was equal to that of penicillin for s. agalactiae, and superior to that of penicillin for viridans streptococci. the mic(50) of gemifloxacin for s. pyogenes (0.015 mg/l) was equal  to that of penicillin, with an mic(90) of 0.03 mg/l. gemifloxacin was also active against isolates of s. agalactiae (mic = 0.03-0.06 mg/l) and s. pyogenes (mic = 0.03- 0.06 mg/l) with reduced susceptibility to ofloxacin (mic = 4-8 mg/l) and grepafloxacin (mic = 4 mg/l). these preliminary observations indicate that gemifloxacin is a promising antimicrobial agent for clinical use.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the usa.
AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

TI  == beta 2 integrins are involved in cytokine responses to whole gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == proinflammatory cytokines have an important pathophysiologic role in septic shock. cd14 is involved in cytokine responses to a number of purified bacterial products, including lps. however, little is known of monocyte receptors involved  in cytokine responses to whole bacteria. to identify these receptors, human monocytes were pretreated with different mabs and tnf-alpha was measured in culture supernatants after stimulation with whole heat-killed bacteria. human serum and anti-cd14 abs significantly increased and decreased, respectively, tnf-alpha responses to the gram-negative escherichia coli. however, neither treatment influenced responses to any of the gram-positive bacteria tested, including group a and b streptococci, listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus  aureus. complement receptor type iii (cr3 or cd18/cd11b) abs prevented tnf-alpha  release induced by heat-killed group a or b streptococci. in contrast, the same abs had no effects when monocytes were stimulated with l. monocytogenes or s. aureus. using either of the latter bacteria, significant inhibition of tnf-alpha  release was produced by abs to cd11c, one of the subunits of cr4. to confirm these blocking ab data, il-6 release was measured in cr3-, cr4-, or cd14-transfected chinese hamster ovary cells after bacterial stimulation. accordingly, streptococci triggered moderate il-6 production (p < 0.05) in cr3 but not cd14 or cr4 transfectants. in contrast, l. monocytogenes and s. aureus induced il-6 release in cr4 but not cr3 or cd14 transfectants. collectively our data indicate that beta 2 integrins, such as cr3 and cr4, may be involved in cytokine responses to gram-positive bacteria. moreover, cd14 may play a more important role in responses to whole gram-negative bacteria relative to gram-positive ones.

TI  == characterization of the streptococcal c5a peptidase using a c5a-green fluorescent protein fusion protein substrate.
AB  == a glutathione-s-transferase (gst)-c5a-green fluorescent protein (gfp) fusion protein was designed for use as a substrate for the streptococcal c5a peptidase (scpa). the substrate was immobilized on a glutathione-sepharose affinity matrix  and used to measure wild-type scpa activity in the range of 0.8 to 800 nm. the results of the assay demonstrated that scpa is highly heat stable and has optimal activity on the synthetic substrate at or above ph 8.0. scpa activity was unaffected by 0.1 to 10 mm ca(2+), mg(2+), and mn(2+) but was inhibited by the same concentrations of zn(2+). the assay shows high sensitivity to ionic strength; nacl inhibits scpa cleavage of gst-c5a-gfp in a dose-dependent manner.  based on previously published computer homology modeling, four substitutions were introduced into the putative active site of scpa: asp(130)-ala, his(193)-ala, asn(295)-ala, and ser(512)-ala. all four mutant proteins had over 1,000-fold less proteolytic activity on c5a in vitro, as determined both by the gfp assay described here and by a polymorphonuclear cell adherence assay. in addition, recombinant scpa1 and scpa49, from two distinct lineages of streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococci), and recombinant scpb, from streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococci), were compared in the gfp assay. the three enzymes had similar activities, all cleaving approximately 6 mol of c5a mmol of scp(-1) liter(-1) min(-1).

TI  == group b streptococci and other gram-positive cocci bind to cytokeratin 8.
AB  == group b streptococci (gbs) adhere to surface receptors present on epithelial cells; these receptors include fibronectin and laminin. to identify other possible receptors, plasma membranes from a549 cells, a respiratory tract epithelial cell line, were prepared. these plasma membranes were tested in a protein blot analysis using radiolabeled gbs as a probe. gbs adhered to two species, with molecular masses of 50 kda (p50) and 57 kda (p57). we concluded that p50 and p57 correspond to two forms of cytokeratin 8 (ck8) on the basis of the following results: (i) protein blot results demonstrated that p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with two forms of ck8 after separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page); (ii) p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with ck8 after separation by two-dimensional page; (iii) ck8 in solution bound to gbs, as demonstrated by immunoblot analysis of proteins from a549 lysates that bound to gbs in a liquid-phase assay; and (iv) radiolabeled gbs bound to a549 lysate-derived ck8 that had been captured in anti-ck8-coated microtiter wells. ck8 bound to coh1-13, an acapsular mutant of coh1, demonstrating that adherence is not mediated by capsular polysaccharide. trypsin-treated gbs did not bind to ck8, indicating that adherence is mediated via a protein on the surface of gbs. soluble ck8 bound to six of six gbs strains  tested. soluble ck8 also bound to staphylococcus aureus, lactococcus lactis, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pyogenes. we hypothesize that adherence  of gbs to cytokeratin may be important for maintenance of colonization at sites of keratinized epithelium, such as the vagina, or for adherence of these bacteria to damaged epithelial cells at other sites.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin against 4151 gram-negative and gram-positive organisms.
AB  == gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin are fluoroquinolones  with enhanced gram-positive activity while retaining broad-spectrum activity against gram-negative pathogens. levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin are older quinolones with broad activity against gram-negative pathogens and borderline activity against some gram-positive organisms. we compared the in vitro activity  of these compounds against 4151 gram-negative and -positive organisms. gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin were highly active against penicillin sensitive and resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae. ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were active but less potent. all compounds were highly active (overall) against gram-negative pathogens with ciprofloxacin being  the most active agent against pseudomonas aeruginosa. our data indicate that the  advanced fluoroquinolones will be important compounds for treating infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens.

AB  == during the period from january of 1995 to june of 1998, 27 beta-hemolytic streptococci were isolated from 25 cases of infectious skin diseases including secondary infections, impetigo, phlegmone, and paronychia. the rate of beta-hemolytic streptococci among all kinds of the isolates was found to be similar during those 4 years, ranging from 3.5% to 5.6%. staphylococcus aureus were found to coexist with beta-hemolytic streptococci in 20 (80%) out of 25 cases. beta-hemolytic streptococci were also often associated with coagulase-negative staphylococci, gram-positive rods, or other species. twelve cases (48%) carried beta-hemolytic streptococci predominantly. most beta-hemolytic streptococci showed high susceptibilities to all antimicrobials tested; however s. agalactiae showed no susceptibility to gentamicin. the evaluation of characteristics of streptococcus species is very important for selecting the right antimicrobial agents and the proper term of chemotherapy.

TI  == group b streptococcal surface proteins as targets for protective antibodies: identification of two novel proteins in strains of serotype v.
AB  == strains of group b streptococcus (gbs) express surface proteins that confer protective immunity. in particular, most strains of the four classical capsular serotypes (ia, ib, ii, and iii) express either of the rib and alpha proteins, two members of the same protein family. here, we report a study of surface proteins expressed by strains of serotype v, which has recently emerged as an important serotype among gbs strains causing serious disease. two novel gbs proteins were identified, purified, and characterized. one of these proteins, designated fbs, was immunologically unrelated to other gbs surface proteins. this approximately 110-kda protein was found in 15 of 49 (31%) type v isolates but in few strains of other serotypes. the fbs proteins expressed by different strains showed limited variation in size. the most common surface protein among type v strains, found in 29 of 49 (59%) isolates, was designated rib-like, since it cross-reacted with rib but was not immunologically identical to rib. characterization of this rib-like protein showed that the n-terminal sequence (12 residues) was identical to that of alpha, although these two proteins lacked cross-reactivity. the biochemical and immunological properties of the rib-like gbs protein indicate that it is closely related to the r28 protein of streptococcus pyogenes. importantly, passive and active immunization experiments with mice showed that the fbs and rib-like proteins are targets for protective antibodies. these two proteins are therefore of interest for analysis of pathogenic mechanisms and for vaccine development.

AB  == methods: within a multicenter study coordinated by who, an investigation of the etiologic agents of pneumonia, sepsis and meningitis was performed among infants  younger than 3 months of age seen at the ethio-swedish children's hospital in addis ababa for a period of 2 years. of the 816 infants enrolled 405 had clinical indications for investigation. results: there were a total of 41 isolates from blood cultures from 40 infants. the study showed that the traditionally known acute respiratory infection pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae was most common in  this extended neonatal age group, found in 10 of 41 blood isolates. streptococcus pyogenes was a common pathogen in this setting (9 of 41 blood isolates), whereas  salmonella group b was found in 5 of 41 isolates. streptococcus agalactiae, which is a common pathogen in developed countries, was absent. a study of the susceptibility pattern of these organisms suggests that a combination of ampicillin with an aminoglycoside is adequate for initial treatment of these serious bacterial infections, but the combination is not optimal for the treatment of salmonella infections. among 202 infants on whom immunofluorescent antibody studies for viruses were performed based on nasopharyngeal aspirates, respiratory syncytial virus was found in 57 (28%) infants, and chlamydia trachomatis was isolated in 32 (15.8%) of 203 infants.

TI  == etiology of serious infections in young gambian infants.
AB  == background: despite improvements in infant mortality rates in many developing countries including the gambia, neonatal mortality remains high and many neonatal deaths are caused by infection. the study described in this paper was conducted to determine the bacterial and viral etiology of serious infections in gambian infants younger than 91 days old. methods: at a first level health facility 497 infants with symptoms that could indicate serious infection were enrolled, of whom 239 with 1 or more signs of serious infection and 55 with no signs were investigated, yielding 17 cases with positive bacterial cultures of blood and/or  cerebrospinal fluid. at a nearby pediatric referral hospital 198 infants were seen and 182 were investigated, yielding 35 positive bacterial cultures. results: there were 15 culture positive cases of meningitis caused by streptococcus pneumoniae (7), streptococcus pyogenes (2), enterobacter cloacae (2), escherichia coli (1), haemophilus influenzae type b (1), streptococcus agalactiae (1) and salmonella spp. (1). six of these children died. thirty-three infants without meningitis had positive blood cultures for staphylococcus aureus (17), s. pneumoniae (3), salmonella spp. (5), e. coli (3), other enterobacteria (4) and s. agalactiae (1), of whom 14 died. nasopharyngeal aspirates from 438 children were  investigated for common respiratory viruses. respiratory syncytial virus was found in 51, influenza a in 46, influenza b in 22, parainfluenza in 26 and adenovirus in 16. respiratory syncytial virus and influenza a isolates were found most frequently toward the end of the wet season. nasopharyngeal carriage of s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae was studied in 320 infants recruited during the first year. of these 184 (58%) were positive for s. pneumoniae and 141 (44%) were positive for h. influenzae, 18 of which were type b. infants with a bacterial isolate from blood or cerebrospinal fluid were more likely than the rest to die,  whereas those with a viral isolate were less likely to die. conclusions: the most important causes of serious infections in young gambian infants are staphylococcus aureus, s. pneumoniae and salmonella spp.

AB  == objective: to detect the 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) of 3 streptococcal species in the peripheral blood and synovial fluid of patients with psoriatic arthritis (psa). methods: reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) detection targets bacterial 16s rrna, which is present in bacteria at high copy numbers. the 3 species-specific primers for group a streptococci (gas; streptococcus pyogenes), group b streptococci (gbs; streptococcus agalactiae), and streptococcus pneumoniae were designed from the fragments of highly variable  v2 regions of 16s rrna. total rna was prepared from whole peripheral blood and joint fluid obtained from patients with psa and rheumatoid arthritis (ra). all positive pcr reactions were then sequenced with a pharmacia alf dna sequencing system. results: our data in 19 psa patients showed that 7 peripheral blood samples were positive for gas (p = 0.006 versus gas-positive ra patients [n = 0], by fisher's exact test), and 2 were also positive for gbs. one synovial fluid sample from a psa patient was positive for gas. s pneumoniae was absent from all  specimens. seventeen patients with ra were pcr negative for the 3 streptococcal species. peripheral blood from a patient with inflammatory bowel disease was positive for gas. conclusion: the presence of gas 16s rrna in the peripheral blood and synovial fluid of patients with psa supports the concept that psa is a  reactive arthritis to certain streptococci.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro activity of fk041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with  those of cefdinir (cfdn) and cefditoren (cdtr). fk041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk041 was active against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms  except enterococcus faecalis with mic90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. fk041 was more active than cfdn and cdtr against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to cfdn and cdtr against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. fk041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae with an mic range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to cfdn but inferior to cdtr. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative organisms such as neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, fk041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of cfdn and cdtr. however, it was inferior to cdtr in activity against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, morganella morganii, and serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. with fk041 a small difference between mic and mbc against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. fk041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. the stability of fk041 to these enzymes was similar to those of cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of s. aureus (pbp 3, 2, and 1) and e. coli (pbp 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).

TI  == characterization of enterococcus faecalis alkaline phosphatase and use in identifying streptococcus agalactiae secreted proteins.
AB  == we have identified and characterized an enterococcus faecalis alkaline phosphatase (ap, encoded by phoz). the predicted gene product shows homology with alkaline phosphatases from a variety of species; it has especially high similarity with two alkaline phosphatases from bacillus subtilis. expression of phoz in escherichia coli, e. faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus [gbs]), or streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus [gas]) produces a blue-colony phenotype on plates containing a chromogenic substrate, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (xp or bcip). two tests were made to determine if the activity of the enzyme is dependent upon the enzyme's subcellular location. first, elimination of the signal sequence reduced ap activity to 3% of the wild-type activity (or less) in three species of gram-positive bacteria. restoration of export, using the signal sequence from c5a peptidase, restored ap activity to at least 50% of that of the wild type. second, we engineered two chimeric proteins in which ap was fused to either a periplasmic domain or a cytoplasmic domain of lactose permease (a membrane protein). in e. coli, the periplasmic fusion had 17-fold-higher ap activity than the cytoplasmic  fusion. we concluded that ap activity is export dependent. the signal sequence deletion mutant, phozdeltass, was used to identify random genomic fragments from  gbs that encode exported proteins or integral membrane proteins. included in this set of fragments were genes that exhibited homology with the rib protein (a cell  wall protein from gbs) or with dppb (an integral membrane protein from gas). ap acts as a reporter enzyme in gbs, gas, and e. faecalis and is expected to be useful in a variety of gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == identification, cloning, and expression of the camp factor gene (cfa) of group a  streptococci.
AB  == the camp reaction is a synergistic lysis of erythrocytes by the interaction of an extracellular protein (camp factor) produced by some streptococcal species with the staphylococcus aureus sphingomyelinase c (beta-toxin). group a streptococci (gas [streptococcus pyogenes]) have been long considered camp negative, and this  reaction commonly has been used to distinguish gas from streptococcus agalactiae. we here provide evidence that gas possess this gene and produce an extracellular  camp factor capable of participating in a positive camp reaction. the s. pyogenes camp factor is specified by a 774-bp open reading frame homologous to the camp factor genes from s. agalactiae and streptococcus uberis. this gene, designated cfa, was isolated on a 1,256-bp fragment and cloned in escherichia coli. recombinant clones of e. coli expressing cfa secreted an active camp factor. the  deduced 28.5-kda protein encoded by cfa consists of 257 amino acids, with a predicted 28-amino-acid signal peptide. the cfa gene is widely spread among gas:  82 of 100 clinical gas isolates produced a positive camp reaction. of the camp-negative strains, 17 of the 18 gas strains contained the cfa gene. additionally, camp activity was detected in streptococci from serogroups c, m, p, r, and u. the cfa gene was cloned and actively expressed in escherichia coli and  gene fusions were made, placing the beta-galactosidase gene (lacz) under control  of the cfa promoter. these cfa promoter-lacz fusions were introduced into s. pyogenes via a bacteriophage-derived site-specific integration vector where they  showed that the cfa gene has a strong promoter that may be subject to as-yet-unidentified regulatory factors. the results presented here, along with previous reports, indicate that the camp factor gene is fairly widespread among streptococci, being present at least in groups a, b, c, g, m, p, r, and u.

TI  == streptococcal meningitis in adult patients: current epidemiology and clinical spectrum.
AB  == streptococci other than streptococcus pneumoniae are a rare cause of bacterial meningitis in adults. we report 29 cases of streptococcal meningitis (1977-1997). the patients comprised 19 men and 10 women, with a mean age +/- standard deviation of 47 +/- 18 years. nine cases were secondary to neurosurgical procedures, seven to brain abscess, five to cerebrospinal fluid pericranial fistula, and three to endocarditis. causative microorganisms included the following: viridans group streptococci, 20 cases; anaerobic streptococci, 3; streptococcus agalactiae, 3; streptococcus bovis, 2; and streptococcus pyogenes,  1. four streptococcus mitis strains showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin (mic, 0.5-2 microg/ml). five patients (17%) died. the infection is increasing in  the hospital setting. streptococci resistant to penicillin should be considered in the empirical treatment of nosocomial meningitis. in cases of community-acquired infection, anaerobic streptococci or streptococci of the streptococcus milleri group should alert the clinician to the presence of an undiagnosed brain abscess, whereas oral streptococci of the viridans group suggest the diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis.

TI  == the r28 protein of streptococcus pyogenes is related to several group b streptococcal surface proteins, confers protective immunity and promotes binding  to human epithelial cells.
AB  == the r28 protein is a surface molecule expressed by some strains of streptococcus  pyogenes (group a streptococcus). here, we present evidence that r28 may play an  important role in virulence. sequence analysis demonstrated that r28 has an extremely repetitive sequence and can be viewed as a chimera derived from the three surface proteins rib, alpha and beta of the group b streptococcus (gbs). thus, the gene encoding r28 may have originated in gbs. the r28 protein promotes  adhesion to human epithelial cells, as shown by experiments with an r28-negative  mutant and by the demonstration that antibodies to highly purified r28 inhibited  adhesion. in a mouse model of lethal intraperitoneal s. pyogenes infection, antibodies to r28 conferred protective immunity. however, the virulence of an r28-negative mutant was similar to that of the parental strain in the intraperitoneal infection model. together, these data indicate that r28 represents a novel type of adhesin expressed by s. pyogenes and that r28 may also act as a target for protective antibodies at later stages of an infection. we consider the hypothesis that r28 played a pathogenetic role in the well-known epidemics of childbed fever (puerperal fever), which were caused by s. pyogenes.  a role for r28 in these epidemics is suggested by epidemiological data.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of g1: a novel antimicrobial compound.
AB  == g1 (1-[5-bromofur-2-il]-2-bromo-2-nitroethene) is a novel antimicrobial compound  developed in cuba with reported broadspectrum activity against gram-positive and  -negative bacteria, yeasts and fungi. a compound of this nature may have considerable therapeutic potential. we tested the in vitro activity of this novel compound against 3595 organisms using microbroth dilution. the following are mic50, mic90 and range respectively for some of the microorganisms tested: e. coli 16, 16, 4 32; klebsiella sp. 16, 16, 8 32; citrobacter sp. 16, 16, 8 16; enterobacter sp. 16, 16, 8-16; proteus sp. 16, 16, 8-16; coagulase-negative staphylococci 16, 32, 4-32; enterococcus sp. 16, 32, 2-32; staphylococcus aureus  8, 16, 4-16; streptococcus agalactiae 4, 8, 4 8; streptococcus pyogenes 4, 8, 0.25-16; candida albicans 2, 2, 1-4; candida tropicalis 4, 4, 2-4; candida sp. 2,4, 1-4. mic values appear lower for gram-positive microorganisms and yeasts. g1 appears to be a novel antimicrobial agent with broad spectrum activity against bacterial and fungal pathogens. defining the activity of this compound against multi-resistant bacteria is a priority.

TI  == [a consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-positive cocci and gram-negative cocci].
AB  == the results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the japanese ministry of health and welfare during the period of january 1993 to july 1995, were analyzed for typical gram-positive  cocci and gram-negative cocci in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. during these 3 years, streptococcus pyogenes (group a) and streptococcus agalactiae (group b) showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to ofloxacin (oflx) and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (st), while  streptococcus pneumoniae and moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis showed slightly  decreasing tendency to cefaclor (ccl). however, these annual changes were almost  negligible. generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against gram-positive and -negative cocci. however, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. on the other hand, cefmetazole (cmz), vancomycin (vcm), latamoxef (lmox), st and minocycline (mino) showed good activities against some of the gram-positive and -negative cocci to which no indication are approved. in conclusion, beside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents)  could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of an antimicrobial agent is necessary.

TI  == blue/white screening of recombinant plasmids in gram-positive bacteria by interruption of alkaline phosphatase gene (phoz) expression.
AB  == the process of screening bacterial transformants for recombinant plasmids is made more rapid and simple by the use of vectors with visually detectable reporter genes. in such systems, an alteration in colony phenotype occurs when a vector-borne indicator gene is interrupted with exogenous dna. although the lacz  system has been used extensively for this purpose in e. coli, analogous systems for use in gram-positive bacteria remain uncommon. we have developed a gram-positive cloning vector that utilizes the interruption of an alkaline phosphatase gene, phoz, to identify recombinant plasmids. to facilitate introduction of foreign dna, a multiple cloning site (mcs) was inserted distal to the region coding for the putative signal peptide of phoz. alkaline phosphatase expressed from the derivative phoz gene (phozmcs) retained activity similar to that of the native protein. the phozmcs was transferred to pjs3, a well-characterized, high-copy number, and broad-host-range plasmid, to produce pdc123. in pdc123, phozmcs was transcriptionally linked to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (cat) gene under the control of the constitutively expressed tetm and cat promoters that drive cat expression in pjs3. s. agalactiae (group b  streptococci, gbs), e. faecalis, s. pyogenes, s. gordonii, and e. coli containing pdc123 displayed a blue colonial phenotype on agar containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (x-p), which was readily distinguished from  that of colonies containing the parent plasmid pjs3. introduction of foreign dna  into the mcs of phozmcs produced a white colonial phenotype in e. coli and gbs on agar containing x-p and allowed discrimination between transformants containing recombinant plasmids versus those maintaining self-annealed or uncut vector. we have used pdc123 to subclone the cpse gene from the plasmid pcer111, which carries a 9.0-kb fragment of the gbs capsular polysaccharide synthesis locus. the plasmid pdc123 containing cpse was isolated by direct electroporation into gbs strain a909 with selection of transformants containing recombinant plasmids achieved by 'blue/white' screening, without the use of an intermediate host. this new cloning vector should improve the efficiency of performing recombinant dna experiments in gram-positive bacteria.

AB  == a drug susceptibility test of the combination drug taz/pipc, which consists of a  newly developed beta-lactamase inhibitor, tazobactam (taz), and one of penicillin antibiotics, piperacillin (pipc), with combination ratio of 1:4 in potency, was conducted with stock strains and clinical isolates. the clinical efficacy and safety of its injection was also evaluated in children with a variety of infectious diseases. the results were as follows: 1. in susceptibility test, 114  strains from 4 species of stock strains were treated with 8 drugs, that is, taz/pipc, pipc, penicillin g (pcg), ampicillin (abpc), cefotiam (ctm), cefotaxime (ctx), ceftazidime (caz), and sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz). of three clinically isolated species from patients, staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) was  treated with taz/pipc, pipc, methicillin (dmppc), ctm, ctx, and sbt/cpz, and the  others were treated with the same drugs except for dmppc. the mics were measured  for these bacterial strains inoculated at the concentration of 10(6) cfu/ml. the  mic90 values of taz/pipc against 45 strains of streptococcus pyogenes (s. pyogenes), one of the stock cultures of gram-positive cocci, were 0.05 microgram/ml and similar to those of pipc, ctm, caz, and sbt/cpz. the mics of taz/pipc for 28 strains of streptococcus agalactiae (s. agalactiae) were 0.39 microgram/ml and similar to those of pipc, ctm, caz, and sbt/cpz. as for gram-negative bacilli, the mic90 of taz/pipc against 10 strains of bordetella pertussis (b. pertussis) were 0.10 microgram/ml and similar to those of pipc. the mic90 of taz/pipc against 31 strains of haemophilus influenzae (h. influenzae) were 0.05 microgram/ml and similar to those of pipc, ctx, and sbt/cpz. regarding  gram-positive cocci isolated from patients received this combination drug, the mic90 of taz/pipc against 2 strains of s. aureus, a non beta-lactamase producing  strain and a low-beta-lactamase producing strain, were 0.78 microgram/ml and 3.1  micrograms/ml, respectively; the former value was similar to those of pipc, dmppc, ctm, and ctx, and the latter was similar to those of pipc, dmppc, ctx, and sbt/cpz. of 4 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains were inhibited at 0.05 microgram/ml, and the others at 1.56 micrograms/ml; both values were similar to those of pipc, sbt/cpz. as for gram-negative bacilli, 6 of 7 strains of h. influenzae did not produce beta-lactamase and 1 strain was a high producer. the mics of taz/pipc against beta-lactamase nonproducing strains were < or = 0.025 microgram/ml in 5 strains and 0.39 microgram/ml in 1 strain, and the values were  similar to those of pipc and sbt/cpz. while the mic of taz/pipc against the high  beta-lactamase producing strain was 0.78 microgram/ml; similar to that of sbt/cpz and smaller than that of pipc. 2. the results of clinical effects on 7 diseases in 33 cases were as follows: taz/pipc was clinically judged "excellent" in 17 (51.5%); good in 14 (42.4%); fair in 2 (6.1%). no case with no response was seen  in this study, and the total efficacy rate of "excellent" and "good" was 93.9%. 3. bacteriological effects were evaluated in 17 strains of 4 species, and all of  them were eradicated. 4. adverse reactions were judged in 35, which consisted of  33 in which the clinical effects were evaluated and 2 dropped from this study. of these cases, diarrhea was observed in 4 (11.4%). 5. laboratory tests revealed an  increase in platelets in 1 of 32 cases (3.1%), and eosinophilia in 2 of 29 cases  (6.9%). biochemical profile showed an increase in gpt alone and abnormal increases in both got and gpt in 1 each out of 21 cases.

TI  == azithromycin. a review of its use in paediatric infectious diseases.
AB  == azithromycin is an azalide antimicrobial agent active in vitro against major pathogens responsible for infections of the respiratory tract, skin and soft tissues in children. pathogens that are generally susceptible to azithromycin include haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), moraxella catarrhalis, chlamydia pneumoniae, chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma pneumoniae, legionella spp., streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae. azithromycin is also generally active against erythromycin- and penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus. azithromycin is administered once daily, achieves clinically relevant concentrations at sites of infection, is slowly eliminated from the body and has few drug interactions. in children, azithromycin is usually given as either a 3-day course of 10 mg/kg/day or a 5-day course with 10 mg/kg on the first day, followed by 5 mg/kg/day for a further 4 days. these standard regimens were as effective as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, clarithromycin, cefaclor and amoxicillin in the treatment of children with otitis media. azithromycin was also as effective as either phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin  v), erythromycin, clarithromycin or cefaclor against streptococcal pharyngitis or tonsillitis in children, but appears to result in more recurrence of infection than phenoxymethylpenicillin in this indication, necessitating a dosage of 12 mg/kg/day for 5 days. community-acquired pneumonia, bronchitis and other respiratory tract infections in children responded as well to azithromycin as to  amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefaclor, erythromycin or josamycin. azithromycin was similar or superior to ceftibuten in mixed general practice populations of patients. however, symptoms of lower respiratory tract infections resolved more rapidly with azithromycin than with erythromycin, josamycin or cefaclor. skin and soft tissue infections responded as well to azithromycin as to cefaclor, dicloxacillin or flucloxacillin, and oral azithromycin was as effective as ocular tetracycline in treating trachoma. although not as well tolerated as phenoxymethylpenicillin in the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis, azithromycin is at least as well tolerated as most other agents used to treat respiratory tract and other infections in children and was better tolerated than  amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. adverse events that do occur are mostly gastrointestinal and tend to be mild to moderate in severity. conclusions: azithromycin is an effective and well tolerated alternative to first-line agents  in the treatment of respiratory tract, skin and soft tissue infections in children, offerring the convenience of a short, once-daily regimen.

TI  == use of the lactococcal nisa promoter to regulate gene expression in gram-positive bacteria: comparison of induction level and promoter strength.
AB  == we characterized the regulated activity of the lactococcal nisa promoter in strains of the gram-positive species streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and bacillus subtilis. nisa promoter activity was dependent on the proteins nisr and nisk, which constitute a two-component signal transduction system that responds to the  extracellular inducer nisin. the nisin sensitivity and inducer concentration required for maximal induction varied among the strains. significant induction of the nisa promoter (10- to 60-fold induction) was obtained in all of the species studied at a nisin concentration just below the concentration at which growth is  inhibited. the efficiency of the nisa promoter was compared to the efficiencies of the spac, xyla, and laca promoters in b. subtilis and in s. pyogenes. because  nisa promoter-driven expression is regulated in many gram-positive bacteria, we expect it to be useful for genetic studies, especially studies with pathogenic streptococci in which no other regulated promoters have been described.

AB  == glutathione (gamma-glucysgly, gsh) is not found in most gram-positive bacteria, but some appear to synthesize it and others, including streptococcus mutans atcc  33402, import it from their growth medium. import of oxidized glutathione (gssg)  by s. mutans 33402 in 7h9 medium was shown to require glucose and to occur with an apparent km of 18+/-5 microm. gssg, gsh, s-methylglutathione, and homocysteine-glutathione mixed disulfide (hcyssg) were imported at comparable rates (measured by depletion of substrate in the medium), as was the disulfide of gamma-glucys. in contrast, the disulfide of cysgly was not taken up at a measurable rate, indicating that the gamma-glu residue is important for efficient transport. during incubation with gssg, little gssg was detected in cells but gsh and gamma-glucys accumulated during the first 30 min and then declined. no significant intracellular accumulation of cys or sulfide was found. transient intracellular accumulation of d/l-homocysteine, as well as gsh and gamma-glucys,  was observed during import of hcyssg. although substantial levels of gsh were found in cells when s. mutans was grown on media containing glutathione, such gsh accumulation had no effect on the growth rate. however, the presence of cellular  gsh did protect against growth inhibition by the thiol-oxidizing agent diamide. import of glutathione by s. mutans atcc 25175, which like strain 33402 does not synthesize glutathione, occurred at a rate comparable to that of strain 33402, but three species which appear to synthesize glutathione (s. agalactiae atcc 12927, s. pyogenes atcc 8668, and enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212) imported glutathione at negligible or markedly lower rates.

AB  == gv129606 is a new parenteral trinem antibiotic belonging to the beta-lactam class. it combines broad-spectrum activity (against gram-negative and -positive bacteria, aerobes and anaerobes), with high potency and resistance to beta-lactamases. comparative in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities were determined for gv129606 against more than 400 recent clinical isolates (aerobes,  including beta-lactamase producers, and anaerobes), using representative antibacterial agents (meropenem, piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin for aerobes and metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin, and clindamycin for anaerobes). against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and streptococci, gv129606 and meropenem were the most active of the drugs tested. gv129606 showed an mic for 90% of strains tested (mic90) ranging from < or =0.015 to 0.06 microg/ml against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae. against penicillin-susceptible and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, gv129606, meropenem, and cefpirome showed mic90s of < or =0.015 and 1 microg/ml, respectively. meropenem was the most active compound against members of the family enterobacteriaceae with mic90s of < or =0.5 microg/ml. against these species, gv129606 possessed activity superior to those of piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, and gentamicin, with mic90s of < or =8 microg/ml, but its activity was two- to sixfold less than that of ciprofloxacin (with the exception of proteus rettgeri and providencia stuartii).  haemophilus spp., moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also included in the spectrum of gv129606. gv129606 showed good antianaerobe activity, similar to metronidazole. it was stable against all clinically relevant beta-lactamases (similar to meropenem). the in vitro activity was confirmed in vivo against septicemia infections induced in mice by selected gram-positive and -negative bacteria with 50% effective doses (ed50s) of < or =0.05 and < or =0.5 mg/kg of body weight/dose, respectively. gv129606 was as effective as meropenem against septicemia in mice caused by ceftazidime-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, exhibiting an ed50 of 0.33 mg/kg/dose.

TI  == cloning and characterization of a novel macrolide efflux gene, mrea, from streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  == a strain of streptococcus agalactiae displayed resistance to 14-, 15-, and 16-membered macrolides. in pcr assays, total genomic dna from this strain contained neither erm nor mef genes. ecori-digested genomic dna from this strain  was cloned into lambda zap ii to construct a library of s. agalactiae genomic dna. a clone, paes63, expressing resistance to erythromycin, azithromycin, and spiramycin in escherichia coli was recovered. deletion derivatives of paes63 which defined a functional region on this clone that encoded resistance to 14- and 15-membered, but not 16-membered, macrolides were produced. studies that determined the levels of incorporation of radiolabelled erythromycin into e. coli were consistent with the presence of a macrolide efflux determinant. this putative efflux determinant was distinct from the recently described mef pump in  streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae and from the multicomponent msra pump in staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. its gene has been designated mrea (for macrolide resistance efflux).

TI  == [comparative antimicrobial activity of rp 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin), the first semisynthetic injectable streptgramin, against gram-positive cocci and other recent clinical pathogens].
AB  == rp 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin) is the first semisynthetic injectable streptogramin antimicrobial agent, which is a combination of quinupristin and dalfopristin in a 30:70 ratio. the components of rp 59,500 act synergically to provide bactericidal activity through action at different sites on bacterial ribosomes. in the present study, the antimicrobial activity of rp 59,500 was compared with those of four macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin). susceptibility testing was carried out by microdilution method on 303 strains of 10 species, especially antibiotic-resistant gram-positive cocci. rp 59,500 was active against a wide range of gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis were both 0.25 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against penicillin-sensitive, -intermediate and -resistant s. pneumoniae were all 0.5 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. rp 59,500 also exhibited equivalent activities to the four macrolides against strains of streptococcus pyogenes. streptococcus agalactiae and moraxella catarrhalis. rp 59,500 exhibited the highest activities against enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus avium strains which  are intrinsically resistant to most antimicrobial agents. no cross-resistance was observed between rp 59,500 and the four macrolides, which will merit attention in future clinical trials of the agent. the effect of human serum on the mic of rp 59,500 was studied with strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. faecalis. the presence of 20% (v/v) serum had little or no effect on the mic, although 50% (v/v) serum increased mics by 4-8 folds. laboratory-induced resistance to rp 59,500 occurred in a stepwise fashion in broth cultures of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. facalis strains and the induction rate was slow and no more than four fold increases were observed. population analysis was performed on rp 59,500 and the reference macrolides against s. aureus atcc 25,923 strain. although low frequencies (less than 0.01%) of resistant sub-population were detected with em, cam, azm and rxm, no rp 59,500-resistant sub-population was detected in this study.

TI  == [trend of bacterial meningitis in children over a 14 year period (1981 through 1994) in japan--an analysis based on studies in 27 institutions].
AB  == we observed 266 children with purulent meningitis in 27 institutions in japan during the 14 years from 1981 on dividing these years into 3 periods, 1981-1985,  1986-1990 and 1991-1994, and studied the trend of causative organisms identified  in 254 among the 266 patients. their ages were less than 3 months after birth in  50 children and 3 months or older in 216: there were 141 boys and 125 girls. the  causative organisms were h. influenzae in 134 patients and s. pneumoniae in 50, most of them being aged 3 months or older. next to the above bacteria ranked s. agalactiae in 29 and e. coli in 12, many of the patients were aged less than 3 months. staphylococcus spp. was found in 7 patients and about 70% of them were aged 3 months or older. l. monocytogenes was found in 4 patients and n. meningitidis in 3 and they were aged 3 months or older in both patient groups. s. pyogenes, enterococcus spp., peptostreptococcus spp., p. mirabilis and enterobacter spp. were detected each in 1 patient. the causative organism was unknown in 21 patients and there was no double infection. h. influenzae were detected in 18 patients in 1981-1985 period (36.7%), in 56 in 1986-1990 (54.9%) and in 60 in 1991-1994 (63.8%) showing an increasing tendency, but s. pneumoniae  exhibited neither an increasing nor decreasing tendency. there was a decreasing tendency with s. agalactiae and e. coli, but the details were not clear because there were few patients aged less than 3 months. although the period of coexistence of 4 main bacterial species was not made clear in this study. listeria is considered to develop mainly in the early childhood, and we believe that the conventional way of using a cephem preparation and ampicillin combined for patients under 6 years need not be altered. however, panipenem (phonetic) is  likely to be effective for insensible s. pneumoniae for the time being.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of roxithromycin against recently obtained clinical isolates].
AB  == the purpose of our investigation was to monitor current trends in the susceptibility patterns of clinical bacterial isolates to roxithromycin (rxm). we measured the mics of macrolide antibiotics, such as rxm, erythromycin (em), clarithromycin (cam), rokitamycin (rkm) and midecamycin (mdm), and other classes  of antibacterial compounds against various clinical isolates at seven institutions between october and december in 1994 and 1995. rxm had excellent antibacterial activities for s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, m. (b.) catarrhalis and  methicillin sensitive s. aureus. against methicillin sensitive s. epidermidis, rxm activity was fairly good but about 20% of the strains had mic > or = 128 micrograms/ml. the activity against s. pneumoniae was not so potent and similar to activities of em, cam, mdm, and clindamycin. the vast majority of methicillin  resistant s. aureus and s. epidermidis were also resistant to macrolide antibiotics and other classes of compounds tested. in conclusion, rxm is an unique macrolide antibiotic by retaining potent activity against s. pyogenes, s.  agalactiae, s. aureus except mrsa, m. (b.) catarrhalis and m. pneumoniae.

TI  == lancefield grouping and smell of caramel for presumptive identification and assessment of pathogenicity in the streptococcus milleri group.
AB  == aim: to evaluate lancefield grouping and caramel smell for presumptive identification of the streptococcus milleri group, and to find whether lancefield group, species, or protein profile correlated with virulence or infection site. methods: prospective studies were made of 100 consecutive streptococcal isolates  in blood cultures or pus from 100 patients in whom the severity of infection was  categorised as serious, moderate, or not significant. the usefulness of lancefield group and the caramel smell for presumptive identification was examined, and the relation of the s milleri species, lancefield group, and sds-page protein analysis to severity of infection and infection site was investigated. lower respiratory tract and genital tract specimens, strict anaerobes, group d streptococci, and strains identified as streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, or streptococcus agalactiae were excluded. results: most streptococci occurring in pure or significant growth density were s milleri group (87/100; 87%, 95% confidence interval 0.81-0.93). of these, 89.7% (78/87; 0.84-0.96) were associated with infection. lancefield group f antigen predominated (41/87; 47.1%, 0.38-0.56). lancefield group f alone or accompanied by the caramel smell had a specificity of 100%, but a sensitivity of only 47.3% for group f alone, and 19.5% for group f accompanied by the caramel smell. there  was no significant association between species, lancefield group, and severity of infection, site of infection, or pathogenicity. sds-page analysis failed to discriminate between strains. conclusions: neither species nor lancefield antigen was related to the site of infection. the presence of lancefield group f antigen  alone or accompanied by a caramel smell was a useful indicator for the s milleri  group when present, but was too insensitive to use as a screening test. most streptococci occurring in pure culture or in significant growth density were of clinical importance. such organisms should be identified to species level to detect the s milleri group.

TI  == conservation of the c5a peptidase genes in group a and b streptococci.
AB  == the chromosome of group b streptococci (gbs) contains a gene which is related to  the c5a peptidase gene (scpa) of group a streptococci (gas). scpa encodes a surface-associated peptidase (group a streptococcal c5a peptidase [scpa]) which specifically cleaves c5a, a major chemoattractant generated in serum by activation of complement. the entire scpa-like gene (scpb) was cloned from a gbs  strain and sequenced. the gene encodes an open reading frame of 3,450 bp, which corresponds to a deduced protein (scpb) of 1,150 amino acids with a molecular weight of 126,237 da. nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of scpb were found to be highly homologous to those of scpas from gas. unexpectedly, scpa12 is more similar to scpb than to another gas gene, scpa49. the sequence 5' of the open reading frame, including transcription start and a termination site in the signal sequence, is also similar to that of scpa, although less conserved than the coding sequences. the near identity of gbs and gas peptidases is consistent with horizontal transmission of the scp gene between these species. recombinant scpb was expressed in escherichia coli by using the expression vector plasmid pgex-4t-1 and was shown to be identical in size to the enzyme extracted from the  parental gbs strain 78-471.

AB  == in this multicenter study conducted in eight european countries, 13,173 pathogens--all isolated from community-acquired infections in 1992 and 1993--were evaluated for their susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin g, ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. ten centers in italy, five in germany, in the netherlands and switzerland, four in greece and spain, three in hungary and one in finland contributed to this study; ready-to-use standardized microtiter panels (sceptor system, bbl, heidelberg, germany) were used throughout all assays. the most frequently encountered species were: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and non-typhoid salmonella spp., enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus agalactiae, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter freundii, staphylococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, proteus  vulgaris, moraxella catarrhalis and shigella spp. the percentage of susceptible isolates was assessed for each of the above-mentioned countries and european-wide with all the data available. for many species, the percentage of resistant isolates did not differ markedly between the countries considered. however, one of the most striking exceptions was the high prevalence of high-level penicillin-g-resistant s. pneumoniae isolates in hungary and spain; some of the low-level penicillin-g-resistant strains remained susceptible to cefuroxime, whereas complete cross-resistance occurred for all other beta-lactams studied. the high frequency of ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae isolates in spain deserves mentioning; this could be attributed mainly to the prevalence of a beta-lactamase, as the addition of clavulanic acid rendered these strains susceptible to ampicillin. the penicillin compounds exhibited the greatest activity against gram-positive pathogens, whereas cefetamet was the most active agent against gram-negative pathogens with a well-balanced spectrum of activity.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of s-1090, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == s-1090, a new oral cephalosporin, was active against selected gram-negative bacteria and methicillin-susceptible clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus warneri, against which it had excellent activity. s-1090 was the most active compound against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae among the agents compared. the in vivo efficacy of s-1090 against systemic and urinary and respiratory tract infections  caused by gram-positive and -negative bacteria was superior to that expected from the in vitro and in vivo activities of the agents against which it was compared.

TI  == invasion of cultured human cells by streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the invasive capacity of streptococcal strains belonging to groups a and b was evaluated by infecting human epithelial and endothelial cells and monitoring the  number of viable intracellular bacteria at different times postinfection. all strains tested entered eukaryotic cells (hela, hep2 and huve), with streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting a higher invasion efficiency than group b streptococci (gbs). no intracellular multiplication was observed, and gbs remained viable 24 h postinfection, whereas s. pyogenes were gradually killed. we found that cytochalasin d almost completely inhibited internalization of all bacterial strains, whereas colchicine had no effect, indicating that host microfilaments play a major role in bacterial internalization. moreover, the use of the lysosomotropic agent ammonium chloride enabled us to demonstrate that a ph increase in the intracellular vesicles did not affect streptococcal entry. these  results were documented by electron microscopic observations which revealed the different steps in the invasion pathway, including a fusion event between phagosomes containing s. pyogenes and lysosomes.

TI  == characterization of superoxide dismutase genes from gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers.
AB  == an internal fragment representing approximately 85% of sod genes from seven gram-positive bacteria was amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase  chain reaction assay. the dna sequences of sod polymerase chain reaction products from clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactococcus lactis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes were determined. comparisons of their deduced amino acid sequences with those of the corresponding regions of  the sod proteins from bacillus stearothermophilus, listeria monocytogenes, and streptococcus mutans revealed strong relatedness. phylogenetic analysis of sod peptides showed that members of the genera streptococcus and those of the genera  enterococcus constitute two well-supported monophyletic groups. the method described in this study provides a means for easy recovery of sod genes and the construction of sod mutants of various gram-positive pathogens.

AB  == in order to know the epidemiological, clinical and evolutive characteristics of bacteriemia caused by beta-hemolytic streptococci groups a and b, a retrospective investigation was undertaken of 48 bacteremic episodes observed in adult patients for 10 years (1985-1994). twenty-two episodes were caused by group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (gas) and 26 by group b beta-hemolytic streptococci (gbs). patients with gas bacteremia (gasb) had a lower mean age than patients with gbs bacteremia (gbsb) (p = 0.03). infection with immunodeficiency virus was  more common in patients with gasb than in patients with gbsba (27 and 4%, respectively; p = 0.04); in contrast, diabetes mellitus was more common in patients with gbsb than in patients with gasb (27 and 5%, respectively) (p = 0.04). nine (41%) patients with gbsb were i.v. drug abusers; nevertheless, none of the subjects with gbsb were i.v. drug abusers (p < 0.001). the proportion of bacteremia without demonstrable source due to gbs (41%) was significantly higher  than that due to gas (9%) (p = 0.02). five (23%) patients with gasb and other five (20%) patients with gbsb had fatal outcomes, but only in two (9%) and three  (12%) cases, respectively, was death directly attributed to bacteremia. in conclusion, bacteremias caused by gas and gbs have different epidemiological characteristics but similar prognosis.

TI  == comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: a multi-center study in five mediterranean countries.
AB  == in 5 mediterranean countries 7902 pathogens, all isolated in 1992 and 1993 from community-acquired infections, were studied for susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin g, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid (both 2:1 ratio), cefalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime,  cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. ten centers in italy, 4 centers in greece, 3 centers in spain, and 1 center in lebanon and saudi arabia contributed  to this study; all centers used performed standardized microtiter panels (sceptor, bbl, heidelberg, frg). the most frequently isolated pathogens were escherichia coli (n = 1267), proteus mirabilis (n = 843), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 771), enteric salmonella spp. (n = 629), enterobacter cloacae (n = 486), citrobacter freundii (n = 383), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 346), haemophilus influenzae (n = 298), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 294), streptococcus pneumoniae  (n = 246), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 243), and shigella spp. (n = 185). statistical analysis was performed for each of the above countries and for all pooled data available. the penicillin antibiotics were the most active compounds against the  gram-positive cocci, exceeding the mic90 values 2- to 8-fold over all cephalosporins. regarding the gram-negatives (above all klebsiella spp.) cefetamet was by far the most active compound (mic90 = 1 mg/l). regarding the percentage of resistant isolates, there were no striking discrepancies between the centers and countries involved in this study. there was, however, complete cross-resistance in penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae isolates (mic90 = 2 mg/l). by far the majority of the penicillin-resistant pneumococci showed additional resistance to doxycycline and erythromycin.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == between 1990 and 1992, 91 necropsies of small ruminants affected with pulmonary illness led to the isolation of the following strains of mycoplasma (m.): m. mycoides subsp. mycoides lc, m. ovipneumoniae, m. agalactiae, m. sp. type d2 and  m. arginini. eleven pasteurella multocida strains (serotypes a1, a3, a5, a7 and d2) and 11 pasteurella haemolytica strains (serotypes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 and 9) were isolated. corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, actinomyces pyogenes, staphylococcus sp., streptococcus sp., bacillus sp. and mycobacterium sp. were also isolated. thirty-two antibiograms were performed on pasteurella, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and actinomyces pyogenes strains. eighty eight p. cent were sensitive to penicillin g and oxytetracycline, and 84% to chloramphenicol; 50% were not sensitive to spiramycin and 47% to streptomycin. one capripoxvirus strain was isolated on sheep. pest of small ruminants (ppr) virus was detected by immunocapture elisa test performed on some lung samples. two serological surveys, one for contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (898 goats),  between 1991 and 1993, and one for ppr (902 sheep and goats) in 1993, were conducted in the north and far north provinces. no antibody against contagious caprine pleuropneumonia was detected. among the animals in the sample, ppr prevalence was 64 +/- 7% in the far north province and 14 +/- 3% in the north province. concerning control measures, a vaccination campaign against small ruminant pasteurellosis appears to be hardly feasible because of the antigenic diversity of the isolated pasteurella strains. ppr is endemic especially in the far north province. the efficiency of a vaccination campaign against ppr must be  estimated with a field survey.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == the aim of our study was to re-evaluate the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics against bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. the study drugs were cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cefixime, cefuroxime, cefetamet, cefprozil, and the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (= augmentin). in addition, cefotaxime as the standard agent  of parenteral third generation cephalosporins was examined. the organisms tested  were staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococci of serogroups c and g, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis. minimal inhibitory concentrations of  the antimicrobials were determined with the agar dilution procedure. cefpodoxime  showed the broadest spectrum and generally also the highest activity of the oral  beta-lactam antibiotics examined. the drug was equally active against the major groups of beta-lactamase negative and positive bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, all beta-lactam agents exhibited reduced activity comparable to the reduced activity of penicillin.

TI  == the type i macrophage scavenger receptor binds to gram-positive bacteria and recognizes lipoteichoic acid.
AB  == macrophage scavenger receptors exhibit unusually broad binding specificity for polyanionic ligands and have been implicated in atherosclerosis and various host  defense functions. using a radiolabeled, secreted form of the type i bovine macrophage scavenger receptor in an in vitro binding assay, we have found that this receptor binds to intact gram-positive bacteria, including streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus hirae, and listeria monocytogenes. competition binding studies using purified lipoteichoic acid, an anionic polymer expressed on the surface of most gram-positive bacteria, show that lipoteichoic acids are scavenger receptor ligands and probably mediate binding of the receptor to gram-positive bacteria. lipoteichoic acids, for which no host cell receptors have previously been identified, are implicated in the pathogenesis of septic shock due to gram-positive bacteria. scavenger receptors may participate in host defense by clearing lipoteichoic acid and/or intact bacteria from tissues and the circulation during gram-positive sepsis. since scavenger receptors have been previously shown to bind to and facilitate bloodstream clearance of gram-negative bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide), these receptors may provide a general mechanism for macrophage recognition and internalization of pathogens and their cell surface components.

AB  == kawasaki syndrome (ks), the main cause of acquired heart disease in children, is  associated with the selective expansion of v beta 2+ t cells in peripheral blood. our study suggests that ks may be caused by a superantigen--a staphylococcal or streptococcal toxin. bacteria were cultured without knowledge of their origin, from the throat, rectum, axilla, and groin of 16 patients with untreated acute ks and 15 controls. bacteria producing toxins were isolated from 13 of 16 ks patients but from only 1 of 15 controls (p < 0.0001). toxic shock syndrome toxin  (tsst) secreting staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 11 of the 13 toxin-positive cultures, and streptococcal pyogenic exotoxin (spe) b and c were found in the other 2. these toxins are known to stimulate v beta 2+ t cells. all  tsst-producing ks isolates were tryptophan auxotrophs indicating they were clonally related. s aureus isolates from acute ks patients were unusual because they produced less lipase, haemolysin, and protease compared to other isolates (p < 0.01). s aureus colonies from ks patients were white, and could be easily mistaken for coagulase-negative staphylococci, whereas colonies of non-ks isolates were gold. these observations suggest that the expansion of v beta 2+ t  cells in most patients with ks may be caused by a new clone of tsst-producing s aureus, and, in a minority of patients, speb-producing or spec-producing streptococci.

AB  == mixtures of bacteria, enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), streptococcus pyogenes  (atcc 19615), streptococcus agalactiae (atcc 13813), streptococcus pneumoniae (atcc 6303), and staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213), were resolved into discrete  electrophoretic bands using capillary zone electrophoresis (cze). bacteria remained viable (> 90%) during the electrophoretic process. analysis of peak separation indicates organisms were quantitatively resolved and recovered at greater than 98% purity. e. faecalis was resolved into two discrete fractions with different chain assemblages that may reflect different developmental stages. these findings suggest that cze can afford the microbiologist a new tool for studying the composition and distribution of microorganisms in mixed populations.

TI  == streptococcal update. a microbiology perspective.
AB  == the streptococci remain important human pathogens despite it being nearly 60 years since sulphonamides were introduced. rheumatic fever and post glomerulonephritis are common diseases in the aboriginal community, and a new invasive disease, toxic shock-like syndrome, is also caused by group a streptococcus. group b, first described over 50 years ago in obstetric wards remains the primary neonatal pathogen despite attempts to eliminate this organism from the genital tract of the carrier mother. a major concern in paediatrics is the relatively poor response to the current pneumococcal vaccines. australian researchers are playing a major role in developing a new vaccine with high antigenicity against all of the 100 odd serotypes of s pneumoniae. the oral streptococci are now recognised as important opportunistic pathogens and the pathogenesis is well defined. disturbing reports from different geographical regions alert us to the antibiotic resistance in some of the streptococci once thought of as sensitive bacteria, for example, group a has shown resistance to erythromycin, the pneumococcus to penicillin and beta-lactam antibiotics and the  aminoglycosides have been ineffective against the enterococci due to plasmid-borne genes.

TI  == group b streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome: report of a case and purification of an associated pyrogenic toxin.
AB  == a patient with streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome (tsls) caused by streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus) is described. the patient had all of the defining criteria for toxic shock syndrome (tss), including fever, hypotension, erythematous rash, desquamation, and involvement of multiple organs. neither staphylococcus aureus nor group a streptococci were recovered, but vaginal and urine cultures yielded group b streptococci. the group b streptococcal isolate gave negative results in antibody tests for the production  of tss toxin 1, staphylococcal enterotoxins, and streptococcal scarlet fever toxins. however, the strain produced a novel pyrogenic toxin. this toxin, purified from culture fluids by ethanol precipitation, isoelectric focusing, and  reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, had a molecular weight of 12,000 and an isoelectric point of approximately 7.0. the purified toxin was pyrogenic in rabbits, enhanced the susceptibility of the animals to lethal endotoxin shock, and caused the proliferation of rabbit splenocytes; these properties define pyrogenic toxins. when given to three rabbits via a subcutaneous miniosmotic pump, the toxin caused tss-like symptoms ending in death. three additional group b streptococcal strains from patients with tsls were tested and were found to produce a toxin with similar properties.

TI  == prevalence of iga receptors in clinical isolates of streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae: serologic distinction between the receptors by blocking antibodies.
AB  == group a and b streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae)  are the only known bacterial pathogens expressing iga fc-receptors. however, the  iga binding proteins of the two species have been found genetically unrelated. in the present investigation the binding of human iga among clinical isolates of group a and group b streptococci was studied and the respective iga-binding epitopes were compared serologically. surface binding of radiolabelled, monoclonal human iga1 occurred in 38% of 115 unselected group a streptococcal isolates. comparing four predominant t-types, iga-binding was found in 77% and 85%, respectively, of types t4 and t28 strains but only in 5% and 25%, respectively, of t1 and t12 strains. in group b streptococci, 70% of 58 type ib strains but only 2% of 399 strains of other serotypes bound iga. using rabbit immune sera raised to the two streptococcal species it was found that strains exhibiting iga fc-receptors often induced antibodies blocking the binding of iga  to bacteria. furthermore, the blocking shown by an individual serum was restricted to the streptococcal group used for immunization showing that also the iga-binding eptiopes in group a and b streptococci are conformationally distinct. though infections with serotypes often binding iga, compared to other types, are  not known to differ, it is assumed that the non-immune binding of iga might favour mucosal colonization of the organisms.

AB  == antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin (cam) in comparison with other 6 macrolides was determined against 419 recent clinical isolates including streptococci, enterococci, staphylococci, moraxella, haemophilus and bacteroides  strains. mics80's of cam against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae were 0.78, 0.10 and 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. mics80's against moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae were 0.05 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. laboratory-induced resistance to cam in strains of s. pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis or methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus epidermidis occurred in stepwise fashion and at a very low rate. adherence to silicon filter of strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa or s. epidermidis was strongly repressed by the addition of sub-mic of cam or other macrolides. although tosufloxacin (tflx) alone had no bactericidal activity against the sessile cells of p. aeruginosa strains tested, tflx showed synergistic bactericidal activity when combined with sub-mics of cam or erythromycin.

TI  == the microbiologic aspects, including diagnosis, of beta-hemolytic streptococcal and enterococcal infections.
AB  == basic principles concerning the collection, transport, and processing of clinical specimens for the detection of streptococcaceae are given. identification of beta-hemolytic streptococci (s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, lancefield group c and g streptococci, s. anginosus) and enterococci is based on the careful observation of colony morphology and hemolytic pattern on sheep blood agar plates; subsequent genus or species confirmation is achieved by rather simple biochemical or enzymatic tests and by detection of streptococcal cell wall carbohydrate antigens (lancefield grouping). rapid antigen tests for the detection of group a and b streptococci directly from pharyngeal and vaginal swabs, respectively, are highly specific, thus allowing an immediate antibiotic therapy in patients with a positive test result. the reported sensitivities of these nonculture tests are too low to exclude streptococcal colonization or infection, however. the elucidation of the genetics of some major virulence factors of group a and b streptococci has contributed to knowledge of their association with disease, and  molecular techniques have supplemented the traditional (mostly culture and serologic) methods for an improved understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of streptococcal infections. recently employed examples include the  m protein gene typing of group a streptococci by oligonucleotide probes and the use of pcr assays for the detection of the genes encoding for the pyrogenic exotoxins. restriction enzyme endonuclease digestions of bacterial dna in association with dna fragment separation by conventional or pfge have been applied successfully to several species of streptococcaceae (e.g., s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae). enterococci are important pathogens in the hospital setting, exhibiting high morbidity and mortality rates in bacteremic patients with severe  underlying disease. molecular typing methods have clearly confirmed their potential to be nosocomially transmitted. e. faecalis and e. faecium still account for the majority of human infections, but some of the newer enterococcal  species (at present 19 species are recognized) have been encountered as well. the definitive species identification of enterococci requires the performance of an array of biochemical tests. the increasing antimicrobial resistance of enterococci, including high-level resistance to penicillins and aminoglycosides and occasionally also to glycopeptides, has hampered standard therapeutic regimens. all enterococci isolated from serious infections should be tested for high-level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance by one of several methods evaluated; beta-lactamase production (primarily found in e. faecalis) is reliably detected by the nitrocefin test.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == nucleotide sequence analysis of the termini and chromosomal locus involved in site-specific integration of the streptococcal conjugative transposon tn5252.
AB  == the 47-kb, broad-host-range, streptococcal conjugative transposon tn5252 is capable of site-specific integration into the pneumococcal chromosome. we present the nucleotide sequence of the terminal regions of the transposon and its target  site in the pneumococcal genome. no inverted repeats were found at the termini of the transposon. a 72-bp region of the target was present on either side following the insertion of tn5252 and appeared to serve as a signal for its integration and excision. the data suggest that the left copy of the 72-bp segment was a part of  the conjugative element, the crossover point of integration was nonrandom within  this region, and the mechanism of insertion could resemble that of the site-specific temperate phages.

TI  == streptococci and the genital tract.
AB  == streptococci of lancefield group b (gbs) are known to cause maternal sepsis and neonatal infection, whereas streptococci lancefield group a (gas) cause vulvo-vaginitis in both children and adults. prevalence of sgb colonization of the lower genital tract of normal women is between 4-18%, with higher rates found in hospital personnel and delivery rooms. such high carriage rates may be a significant factor in nosocomial transmission of gbs to neonates. symptomatic infection is uncommon and usually secondary to other pathological states. amnionitis is a complication of vaginal carriage of gbs and there is now evidence that chorioamnionitis is associated with pre-term labour and its attendant problems. gbs infection of the male genitalia has also been described. intrapartum chemoprophylaxis has been shown to prevent early onset gbs disease of the neonate. prevalence of gas in the genital tract is lower than that for gbs, but is more likely to be symptomatic. the response to penicillin is usually prompt. optimal drug regimens need to be determined, particularly for use in pregnancy.

TI  == cefprozil. a review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties, and therapeutic potential.
AB  == cefprozil is an orally active cephalosporin which has demonstrated activity against a wide range of organisms in vitro. it is particularly active against the gram-positive organisms streptococcus pyogenes, pneumoniae and agalactiae and against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus. strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus are not susceptible to cefprozil. cefprozil is also moderately active against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, many enterobacteriaceae and certain anaerobic organisms, and is relatively stable to hydrolysis by a number of beta-lactamases. in comparative trials, the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of cefprozil 500mg  or 20 mg/kg administered once or twice daily has been comparable with multiple daily dosage regimens of erythromycin in patients with tonsillitis or pharyngitis, with cefaclor and amoxicillin/clavulanate in lower respiratory tract infections, with amoxicillin/clavulanate and erythromycin in skin and skin-structure infections and with cefaclor in acute uncomplicated urinary tract  infections. the clinical efficacy of cefprozil is similar to that of cefaclor in  patients with tonsillitis or pharyngitis but the bacteriological efficacy of cefprozil is significantly greater than that of cefaclor. cefprozil is clinically more effective than cefuroxime axetil in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections and demonstrated greater efficacy than cefaclor in one of 2 comparative studies when administered twice daily in patients with skin and skin-structure infections. in children with acute otitis media, cefprozil 15 mg/kg twice daily was as effective as cefaclor or amoxicillin/clavulanate 13.3 mg/kg 3 times daily and was as effective as cefixime 8 mg/kg once daily. the most frequently reported adverse effects associated with cefprozil, diarrhoea and nausea, are usually mild to moderate in severity and discontinuation of treatment is rarely necessary. thus, cefprozil with its convenient administration regimen appears to be a suitable alternative to cefaclor, cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate or erythromycin for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections, skin and skin-structure infections, and otitis media in children. while cefprozil has shown similar efficacy to cefaclor in the  treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, well-controlled clinical trials comparing its efficacy with that of cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim+sulfamethoxazole) in this indication are required.

TI  == biochemical and genetic analysis of the unidirectional theta replication of the s. agalactiae plasmid pip501.
AB  == pip501 is a broad-host-range plasmid originating from streptococcus agalactiae. in this report we show that (i) it replicates by a theta mechanism initiating at  the 3' end of the gene encoding the replication protein repr and progressing in the direction of transcription of this gene; (ii) its replication origin lies within or a few nucleotides downstream from orf r and not upstream from it as suggested in the literature (brantl et al. (1990) nucleic acids res. 18, 4783-4789); (iii) the repr protein positively regulates pip501 copy number; and (vi) the main function ensured by the sequences located upstream from orf r is to express this orf. since the replication properties of pip501 are indistinguishable from those of the highly related enterococcus faecalis plasmid  pam beta 1, we conclude that these elements form the first family of theta replicating plasmids in gram-positive bacteria. based on sequence similarities, we extend this family to the s. pyogenes plasmid psm19035 and to 12 other plasmids isolated from streptococci or enterococci.

AB  == we obtained bacterial strains which were clinically isolated and identified from  outpatients with various infections in medical institutions throughout japan. possible antibacterial activities of rokitamycin (rkm) were examined against these isolates. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined through  a comparative study with reference drugs. the results of the study are summarized as follows. 1. resistance patterns of 400 isolates which were highly resistant to macrolides (mls) with mic values > 100 micrograms/ml were classified into 55 patterns. staphylococcus spp. showed cross resistance to 14-membered ring mls with 100% cross resistance observed between erythromycin (em) and clarithromycin  (cam), and 85.2% between em and oleandomycin (ol). fewer isolates showed strong resistance to 16-membered ring mls than to 14-membered ring mls. cross resistances observed among the staphylococcus isolates were 100% between acetylmidecamycin (mdm-ac) and kitasamycin (leucomycin (lm)), 93.9% between mdm-ac and josamycin (jm), and 53.3% between mdm-ac and rkm. streptococcus spp. and peptococcus spp. showed very similar resistance patterns to both 14- and 16-membered ring mls, but resistance patterns to rkm were quite different. most of anaerobic streptococci and bacteroides fragilis group had similar resistance patterns to 14- and 16-membered ring mls, but in some cases a pattern similar to  that of staphylococcus spp. was observed. 2. when ml-resistant bacteria isolated  during 1975 to 1980 were compared to those isolated in 1986 and 1989, it was observed that resistance of staphylococcus aureus remained almost unchanged, that of streptococcus pyogenes was lower in the later years than during 1975 to 1980,  but that of streptococcus pneumoniae increased. 3. most of ml-resistances of the  resistant isolates were inducible, but extents of induction varied depending on drugs tested. strong inductions were observed when 14-membered ring mls were used, but inductions were minimal with 16-membered ring mls. rkm appeared to induce resistance to the least extent. from these results, it appears that the rkm is quite useful clinically even in the 1990s.

AB  == group b streptococci (gbs) and group a streptococci (gas) are known to have surface-associated peptidase activity which specifically cleaves c5a (c5a-ase), the primary chemotaxin for polymorphonuclear leukocytes. amplification products were obtained from gbs genomic dna template by using the polymerase chain reaction and primers corresponding to the c5a peptidase gene of gas (scpa12). a restriction map of the gbs full-length amplified gene (scpb) was developed. the scpb restriction map was found to be highly similar to that of the analogous gene in gas. a 50-bp deletion was located near the 5' end of scpb in a region where repeat sequences are found in scpa12. hybridization experiments confirmed that other serotypes of gbs also carry an scpb-like gene. these results show that gbs  contain a gene, scpb, which is very similar to that harbored by m12 gas. the probability that scpb encodes the c5a-ase protein is discussed.

TI  == identification and characterization of a surface protein-releasing activity in streptococcus mutans and other pathogenic streptococci.
AB  == surface proteins of streptococcus mutans have been reported to be released into the culture filtrate at concentrations that vary with the growth conditions. the  reason for this is not clear. the present study attempts to investigate the mechanism of the protein release. the results showed that whole cells and raffinose-stabilized protoplasts of s. mutans ng8, when incubated in buffers, were capable of releasing their surface proteins in a ph-dependent manner with optimal release at ph 5 to 6. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that the released proteins were very complex. two proteins, adhesin p1, which has been previously shown to interact with a human salivary agglutinin, and glucosyltransferase have been identified among the released proteins. the release of adhesin p1 and other proteins was found to be inhibited by heat, cu2+,zn2+, and thiol-blocking reagents. the inhibition by heat and cu2+ was irreversible, whereas that by the thiol-blocking reagents was reversible. edta, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and n-p-tosyl-l-lysyl-chloromethyl ketone had no effect on the release of p1, indicating that the release was probably not due to proteolytic activity. adhesin p1 from cu(2+)-inactivated s. mutans ng8 protoplasts could be released by mixing  with fresh whole cells and protoplasts, but not the culture filtrate, of a p1-negative mutant of ng8, suggesting that the enzyme is located on the cell surface. this p1-releasing activity was also detected in two other strains of s.  mutans and one strain each of s. gordonii, s. agalactiae, s. pneumoniae, and s. pyogenes. the biological role(s) of this enzyme activity remains to be determined. however, owing to its ability to release virulent surface proteins from the cell, it may play an important role in cell surface modulation among the pathogenic streptococci.

AB  == previous studies have established that inactivated mycobacteria are potent and selective activators of v gamma 9+/v delta 2+ human gamma/delta t cells. here we  have analysed the proliferative response of human gamma/delta t cells to five serologically distinct groups of streptococci. while heat-inactivated streptococci of all five serogroups tested (a, b, c, d and f) induced a strong proliferative response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc), only groups  a, b and c elicited a selective activation of v gamma 9+ gamma/delta t cells in 10 (serogroup b) or 11 (serogroups a and c) of 11 tested healthy individuals. in  striking contrast, groups d and f streptococci failed to activate gamma/delta t cells in nine of 11 donors and induced only a weak gamma/delta t cell response in two additional individuals. depletion of v gamma 9+ t cells before culture completely eliminated all gamma/delta t cell responses to streptococci. these data indicate that groups a, b and c (but not d or f) streptococci can be included in the growing list of selective ligands for v gamma 9+/v delta 2+ human gamma/delta t cells.

TI  == the bactericidal effect of n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase on bacteria.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (nagase) on some of  the potential bacterial pathogens of the cow was determined. nagase treatment significantly decreased the mean log10 number of actinomyces pyogenes (p less than 0.01) and staphylococcus aureus (p less than 0.05) after 2 and 4 hours of incubation at 37 degrees c. similarly nagase treatment significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced the mean log10 number of streptococcus agalactiae and pseudomonas aeruginosa after 4 hours incubation at 37 degrees c. nagase did not reduce the numbers of escherichia coli or enterobacter aerogenes after either 2 or 4 hours incubation. since nagase and presumably other lysosomal enzymes are free on normal mucosal surfaces such as the uterus it is suggested that this direct bactericidal activity may be an important component of the normal defense mechanisms.

TI  == [epidemiology and pathogenesis of streptococcal infection].
AB  == the appearance of the "streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome" led to a growing  interest in infections caused by streptococcus pyogenes (group-a-streptococci). since 1987 some 800 cases with a lethality of 20% or more were observed. contrary to toxic scarlet fever the site of primary infection are the lower respiratory tract or soft tissue infections. erythrogenic toxins and low molecular weight mitogens, inducing cytokines (il-2, il-3, il-6, tnf-alpha, ifn-gamma) seem to be  involved in the pathogenesis of these severe infections. morphologically and culturally the strains isolated from cases of toxic shock-like syndrome cannot be differentiated from isolates of epidemic scarlet fever or sporadic cases. at the  same time, when in scandinavia an epidemic by s.pyogenes type 1 with many cases of toxic shock was observed, the same type caused a scarlet fever epidemic without complications in eastern germany. erythrogenic toxin type a or its toxoid, respectively, can be used for successful immunizations of rabbits. another--antibacterial-immunization can be done with the m-protein of s.pyogenes, which is limited by its type-specificity. streptococcal vaccination is required especially for developing countries with a high incidence of rheumatic fever. infections due to streptococcus agalactiae (group-b streptococci) are often underestimated though they have a first position in septicemia and meningitis of  newborns. taxonomy and nomenclature of streptococci are often changing; a list of the presently known species is presented in table i.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of rp 59500, an injectable streptogramin derived from pristinamycin, was determined by agar dilution and compared with that of pristinamycin. two hundred and sixty-one recent clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci were tested against both antibiotics. the two compounds displayed similar activities. the mic90s of rp 59500 ranged from 0.5 to 2 mg/l in 114 strains of staphylococcus aureus showing various phenotypes of antibiotic resistance (penicillin-susceptible; penicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible; methicillin-resistant; erythromycin-resistant, either inducible or constitutive; quinolone-resistant). similar results were obtained with coagulase-negative staphylococci. rp 59500 was consistently active against streptococci, with mic90s of 0.25, 0.25 and 0.50 mg/l for streptococcus pyogenes  (n = 20), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 20) and streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 20), respectively. enterococcus faecalis (n = 20) appeared to be notably less susceptible (mic90, 8 mg/l). in view of this consistent activity against all staphylococci and streptococci tested, including multiply resistant isolates, rp  59500 merits further investigation.

TI  == role of streptococcal igg fc receptor in tissue deposition of igg in rabbits immunized with streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == induction of anti-igg during hyperimmunization of rabbit with streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococci; gas) was previously shown to require the presence of igg fc receptors (fcr) in the vaccine strain. in the present work, we examined whether streptococcal fcr activity might also be of importance for heart and kidney deposition of igg, known to occur in poststreptococcal sequelae as well as during experimental immunization of animals. each of three igg-binding (gas types m1, m12 and m22) and two non-binding (gas type t27 and s. agalactiae (gbs) type ia) streptococcal strains were used for intravenous immunization of rabbits during two periods of eight and six weeks, respectively, separated by an interval of one month. before use, vaccine strains were treated with kscn and carefully washed in order to remove any surface-bound immunoglobulins. no deaths occurred among injected rabbits. no tissue deposition was elicited by the gas type t27 or  the gbs strain. in contrast, the strains of types m1, m12 and m22 all induced deposits of igg in kidney and heart tissue, beginning during the first immunization period. in two tested animals, receiving gas of types m1 or m22, circulating immune complexes containing anti-igg antibodies were also detected. finally, serum autoantibodies reacting with preparations of heart and kidney, but not lung or liver, were demonstrated in each of six animals receiving m1 or m22,  reaching maximum levels during reimmunization; such antibodies were not evoked by the two strains not binding igg. our results suggest that, in gas with capacity for non-immune binding of igg, triggering of anti-igg acted to enhance tissue deposition of igg or immune complexes in immunized rabbits. furthermore tissue-specific antibodies were elicited only by the igg-binding strains and occurred comparatively late during immunization, suggesting that those antibodies might have been triggered due to the exposition of hidden kidney and heart determinants.

AB  == the effects of fibrinogen on phagocytic killing of streptococcus dysgalactiae from cattle and s. equi from horses were studied in comparison to that of s. pyogenes from humans. phagocytic killing was determined by a fluorometric microassay using glass adherent polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn) from the respective host species, preopsonization with homologous sera led to a dose-dependent increase in phagocytic killing of all streptococcal cultures, preincubation of streptococci with fibrinogen significantly inhibited their phagocytic killing. fibrinogen had no effect on phagocytic killing of non-fibrinogen binding s. agalactiae cultures. further characterization studies with s. dysgalactiae and s. pyogenes revealed that a partial inhibition of phagocytic killing could also be achieved by preincubation with monomeric beta-chains of fibrinogen. digestion of the fibrinogen binding sites on streptococci with proteases resulted in an almost complete loss of the inhibitory effects of fibrinogen on phagocytic killing. it could thus be concluded that by binding fibrinogen animal pathogenic streptococci could evade phagocytic killing  in a similar manner as m protein carrying s. pyogenes isolates from human infections.

AB  == nineteen strains of nutritionally variant streptococci (nvs) were tested for bacteriolytic activity and for their production of and sensitivity to streptococcal bacteriocinlike inhibitory substances (blis). none appeared to produce blis. an inverse relationship was found between the sensitivity to blis and the production of bacteriolytic activity against micrococcus luteus. all but  one of the 14 streptococcus defectivus isolates were sensitive to the blis of s.  pyogenes p5, and these isolates were nonlytic. the five s. adjacens isolates were not sensitive to any blis tested, and all of these isolates displayed bacteriolytic activity. sensitivity to the blis of s. agalactiae p3 separated the nonlytic s. defectivus strains into two categories.

TI  == [bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefpirome in the field  of pediatrics].
AB  == bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome (cpr, hr 810), a new cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. the results obtained are summarized below. 1. antibacterial activities of cpr against clinically isolated strains of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae were superior to those of ceftazidime. 2. plasma concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of cpr at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 2 cases each were determined. mean peak plasma concentrations of cpr at these dose levels were 33.9, 62.9 and 96.0 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes with plasma half-lives of 1.58, 1.69, and 2.13 hours, respectively. mean cumulative urinary excretion rates in the first 8 hours after administration were 51.2, 78.0 and 74.9%, respectively. 3. ten patients with bacterial infections (pneumonia 5 cases, urinary tract infection 5 cases) were treated with cpr at a daily dose of  16-79 mg/kg/day. the overall clinical efficacy and bacteriological eradication rates were both 100%. 4. no adverse reactions were observed except in 1 case of mild pain in blood vessels. abnormal laboratory test results were also mild, slight elevation of got, gpt and thrombocytosis in 1 case and eosinophilia in 1 case.

TI  == the relationship of tonsil bacterial concentration to surface and core cultures in chronic tonsillar disease in children.
AB  == fifty-five tonsils removed for chronic tonsillar disease (chronic tonsillitis and obstructive tonsillar hyperplasia) underwent surface swab and quantitative core cultures in order to identify the relationship between core bacterial concentration and the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsil surface. the accuracy of a single core culture was further established by quantitative cultures of 9 sections per tonsil in an additional 19 tonsils. the results indicate that many (61.5%) but not all aerobic bacteria which were found in the tonsil core were cultured from the surface of the tonsil. conversely, the tonsil  core bacteria with the highest bacterial concentrations are more likely to be present on the tonsillar surface and the greater the bacterial concentration, the more likely the bacteria are to be found in most if not all areas of the tonsil core. therefore, the core bacterial concentration appears to be related to the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsillar surface. surface bacteria may not,  however, be truly representative of the core bacterial environment. implications  for the management of chronic tonsillar disease will be discussed.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activities of pd 131628, a new 1,8-naphthyridine anti-infective agent.
AB  == pd 131628 is a new aminopyrrolidine-substituted fluorocyclopropyl naphthyridine quinolone which possesses high in vitro activity against a wide spectrum of bacterial species. the mics for greater than or equal to 90% of strains were 0.125 to 0.25 microgram/ml for staphylococci, streptococcus pyogenes, and s. pneumoniae; 0.5 micrograms/ml for s. agalactiae and enterococcus faecalis; 0.125  micrograms/ml for members of the family enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter spp.; 0.5 micrograms/ml for pseudomonas aeruginosa; and less than or equal to 0.03 micrograms/ml for haemophilus influenzae, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. in these in vitro comparisons with ciprofloxacin, pd 131628 is more active against gram-positive organisms, approximately equivalent against gram-negative organisms, and, like most other quinolones, relatively inactive against gram-negative anaerobes. in most instances, the in vitro potency of pd 131628 exceeded those of widely used compounds: ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ampicillin, penicillin g, oxacillin, cefazolin, ceftazidime, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, aztreonam, piperacillin, amikacin, spectinomycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin.

TI  == comparative antimicrobial activity of ceftibuten against multiply-resistant microorganisms from belgium.
AB  == to study the activity of ceftibuten, we obtained multiply-resistant isolates from approximately 20 hospitals in belgium. against enterobacteriaceae, all of the tested comparative compounds were more active than cefaclor, and ceftibuten and tigemonam were the most active of the agents tested. ceftibuten mic50s were less  than or equal to 1 microgram/ml for most enteric bacilli species and 85% of strains were susceptible (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml). this level of activity compared favorably to that recorded for cefaclor (less than or equal to  8 micrograms/ml), cefetamet (less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml), and cefteram (less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml), that is, 37%, 69%, and 59%, respectively. ceftibuten, cefetamet, cefteram, and tigemonam were highly active against isolates of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae. none of the comparative agents were as active as cefaclor against staphylococcal isolates. against streptococci, cefteram was the most active, and tigemonam the least active of the agents. the mic90s of ceftibuten for strains of streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes were 2 micrograms/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml,  respectively. strains of streptococcus agalactiae were resistant to both ceftibuten and tigemonam; cefaclor and cefteram inhibited 100% of isolates of this species. strains of enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa were consistently resistant to all of the compounds. overall, ceftibuten exhibited potent activity against many multiply-resistant clinical isolates.

TI  == application of the polymerase chain reaction to study the m protein(-like) gene family in beta-hemolytic streptococci.
AB  == evaluation of homologous regions of published m protein (emm) gene sequences from group a streptococci (gas; streptococcus pyogenes) was used to design three primer pairs for polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and three oligonucleotide probe  sequences internal to the amplified products. one set of primers and corresponding probe should detect and lead to amplification of emm(-like) genes of virtually every type ("all m"), another ("sor-m") should only amplify emm(-like) genes from gas negative for serum opacity reaction (sor) and the third ("sor+ m") should expand only emm(-like) genes from sor+ gas. using the "allm" primer pair for pcr on the genomic dna from gas of 29 different m types as well as from a group c and a group g streptococcal isolate, dna fragments within the expected size range were amplified in every assay. all pcr products reacted with  the "allm" probe. related sequences were not detected in genomic dna of an s. agalactiae and an enterococcus faecalis isolate. applying the "sor-m" and "sor+m" primers to identical assays led to mutually exclusive amplification products. the "sor-m" and "sor+m" probes hybridized only to their corresponding products. exceptions to this exclusivity were the sor- gas of m types 3, 8, 27, 34, 42, 67, and 69, which consistently reacted only with the "sor+m" primer/probe set. analysis of sequence data from the amplified emm(-like) 2, 3, 18, and 19 genes revealed interesting specific features such as conserved gaps in the c-terminal sequence regions from sor+ and the exceptional sor- gas strains. these data indicate the existence of a subgroup of strains among sor- gas and may advance our understanding of phylogenetic relationship between different serotypes of gas.

TI  == cefixime shows good effects on group a and group b beta-haemolytic streptococci.
AB  == there is continued interest in the development of oral beta-lactam compounds, which can be used clinically to treat various bacterial infections, particularly  those caused by beta-haemolytic streptococci. cefixime is a new orally active cephalosporin, with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, including enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. cefixime is highly resistant to hydrolysis by most beta-lactamases. in this study the authors examined the effects of this molecule on group a and group b beta-haemolytic streptococci, recently isolated from clinical specimens in the authors' laboratory. mics and the growth curves of 36 strains of group a streptococci and the effects of sub-mics on buccal cell adhesion were evaluated. the results show that concerning the sub-mic cefixime effect on streptococci adherence, the treatment led to a decrease in adherence to the cells of the strains studied. moreover cefixime showed good activity with 86.1% of the strains with mic less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml, and the growth curves demonstrated that the molecule possesses a bactericidal effect after 3 h. concerning group b streptococci, 70.3% of the strains showed a mic less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. in conclusion cefixime demonstrates good activity on beta-haemolytic streptococci, particularly those of group a.

AB  == the group b streptococcus is an opportunistic pathogen that causes a variety of serious infections including bacteremias, puerperal sepsis, and neonatal meningitis. group b streptococcal infections of muscle are rare. we report here an unusual case of group b streptococcal pyomyositis. pyomyositis arises predominantly from infections caused by staphylococcus aureus and, occasionally,  streptococcus pyogenes. because of the rarity of pyomyositis in temperate climates, the common lack of localizing signs or symptoms, and the frequently negative blood cultures, considerable delay often precedes the diagnosis of pyomyositis; in fact, the infection has been initially misdiagnosed as muscle hematoma, cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, osteomyelitis, or neoplasm. diagnosis may be greatly aided by radiologic techniques that can demonstrate the sites of muscle enlargement and the presence of fluid collections. the response to antibiotics is usually rapid, but resolution of the infection may require aspiration of deeply situated muscle abscesses. this report describes a diabetic  patient with an unusual presentation of pyomyositis that mimicked an acute abdomen.

TI  == presence of chromosomal elements resembling the composite structure tn3701 in streptococci.
AB  == tn3701, carried by streptococcus pyogenes a454, is the first chromosomal composite element to be described; it contains in its central region tn3703, a transposon similar to tn916. a comparison by dna-dna hybridization of tn3701 with omega(cat-tet) and tn3951, carried by streptococcus pneumoniae bm6001 and by streptococcus agalactiae b109, respectively, revealed that the two latter structures are also tn3701-like composite elements. the dnas of 27 other antibiotic-resistant group a, b, c, and g streptococci and of s. pneumoniae bm4200 showed sequence homologies to tn3701 (14 strains, including bm4200), to the regions of tn3701 outside of tn3703 (5 strains), and to tn916 alone (8 strains). the dnas of five strains did not detectably hybridize with any probe. the tetm gene was identified in most chromosomal genetic elements coding for tetracycline-minocycline resistance. since tn3701-like elements are widely disseminated among antibiotic-resistant streptococci (47% of the 34 strains studied), we propose that tn3701 be considered the prototype of chromosomal composite elements.

TI  == mechanisms of bacterial opsonization by immune globulin intravenous: correlation  of complement consumption with opsonic activity and protective efficacy.
AB  == to study the mechanism of bacterial opsonization by immune globulin intravenous (igiv) complement consumption and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (pmnl) membrane receptor (fcrlo, cr1, and cr3)-mediated phagocytosis of staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and groups a and b streptococci were examined. igiv alone did not consume complement and showed no opsonic activity by itself for these organisms. when these bacteria were preopsonized in igiv, significant amounts of complement were consumed (44%-94%) and the uptake and killing of bacteria occurred. the in vitro opsonic activity of igiv for these organisms was significantly correlated with the amount of complement consumed by  the igiv-opsonized bacteria (r = .85, p less than .05). the in vivo protective efficacy of igiv also appeared to be directly associated with its ability to activate and consume complement (r = 1.0, p less than .001). antibodies to fcrlo  (leu 11) markedly inhibited phagocytosis of bacteria opsonized in igiv but not that of bacteria opsonized in specific igm. both cr1 and cr3 receptors on pmnls were involved in uptake, but the contribution of each is different with different organisms.

TI  == dna probe for identification of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == a total of 287 clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) were  tested for their ability to undergo autolysis when treated with sodium deoxycholate. the test was positive for all but one isolate, strain doc-1. this autolysis required the activity of an enzyme which is unique and characteristic of s. pneumoniae: a choline-dependent n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, the gene product of the lyta gene. we used lyta as a dna probe to test the distribution of the autolysin gene among clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae. in dot blot hybridization experiments our probe reacted with the dna of 60 of 60 strains tested, including the autolysis-deficient clinical isolate doc-1. no hybridization occurred when strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus bovis were tested. the lyta gene appears to be an ideal candidate for use as a dna probe for the identification of s. pneumoniae.

AB  == the international and original research data on the adhesion of group a and b streptococci are over-viewed. based on the conducted studies, a conclusion has been drawn on the polyfactor pattern of pathogenic streptococci adhesions. the polyfactor pattern of adhesion is manifested in (a) different ranges of tissue sensitivity to streptococci adhesion, (b) a correlation between the adhesiveness  and particular phenotypes (m(+)-m-; of(+)-of- in group a streptococci, tsa(+)-tsa- in group b streptococci), (c) different sensitivity of adhesives to proteolytic enzymes, and (d) interaction with fibronectin. m-protein was found to be involved in specific pyogenic streptococcal adhesion to the pharyngeal epithelium, which opens up new vistas for the search of approaches to the prevention of mucosal colonization. the participation of lipoteichoic acid (lta)  in group a and b streptococci adhesion in different tissues was shown the involvement of proteins in group b streptococcal adhesion was suggested by indirect evidence, which needs to be confirmed by direct isolation of an adhesive. it is suggested, that different quantitative combinations as well as structural organization of protein complexes and lta in the streptococcus cell wall may determine the strain and species specificity of pathogenic group a and b streptococci interaction with host tissues.

AB  == the cellular locations of deacylated lipoteichoic acid (dlta) and lipoteichoic acid (lta) were examined in late-exponential-phase cells of a serotype iii strain of streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococci [gbs]) isolated from an infant  with late-onset meningitis and compared with a fresh clinical isolate of streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococci [gas]). lta and dlta were found to be associated with the protoplast membranes of both organisms, with only dlta found in mutanolysin cell wall digests. both organisms released dlta during growth, but only the gas released substantial levels of lta into the culture medium. however, penicillin treatment (5 micrograms/ml for 60 min) of gbs resulted in the recovery of lta in cell wall digests as well as in the culture medium. these results suggest that under normal growth conditions, the hydrophobic region (glycolipid) of lta remains associated with the cytoplasmic membrane of gbs and unavailable for hydrophobic interactions at the cell surface  with epithelial cells. in contrast, release of lta into the environment by the gas allows the fatty acid moieties to interact with hydrophobic domains on the surface of epithelial cells. these results may help explain the marked differences in the specificity of binding between these two major streptococcal pathogens for human fetal and adult epithelial cells.

TI  == [the study of flomoxef in the pediatric field].
AB  == flomoxef (fmox; 6315-s), a new synthetic oxacephem antibiotic, was studied in the pediatric field and pharmacokinetic and clinical results obtained were summarized below. 1. the activity of fmox against staphylococcus aureus isolated from clinical patients, including latamoxef resistant strains was very high and mic was approximately less than or equal to 0.39 microgram/ml. this mic value was lower than other cephem antibiotics such as cefotaxime, cefotiam, cefmetazole, cefamandole. the distribution of mic's of fmox against escherichia coli and salmonella spp. ranged from 0.05 to 0.78 microgram/ml and from 0.05 to 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. 2. serum concentrations of fmox after dosages of 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg with 1 hour intravenous drip infusion were 21.5-27.5 micrograms/ml, 6.00-7.81 micrograms/ml, 0.37-0.59 micrograms/ml at 1, 2, 5 hours  after administration, respectively, and t1/2(beta) were 0.61-0.83 hour. serum concentrations after one shot intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg fmox were 56.7-90.2 and 0.20-0.26 micrograms/ml at 3-10 minutes and 6 hours after administration, respectively, t1/2(beta) was 1.22 hours and urinary excretion rate was 66.7-69.8% in 6 hours. 3. fmox was administered to 32 cases (upper and lower respiratory tract infection, and purulent infections) at 3-4 times daily for 4-13 days. in these cases the daily dosage amounted to 41-119 mg/kg. clinical effectiveness was 97% overall including resistance cases upon other cephem antibiotic treatment. all bacterial species identified including branhamella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes, s. aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, and haemophilus influenzae were eradicated upon the treatment with fmox. 4. only 3 cases of soft stool, 1 case of elevated got and gpt, and 1 case of elevated gpt were observed, and all of these adverse reactions were normalized after the completion of treatment.

TI  == novel complex formed between a nonproteolytic cell wall protein of group a streptococci and alpha 2-macroglobulin.
AB  == binding of 125i-labeled alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2m) to streptococci belonging to serological groups a, b, c, and g was studied. streptococci of groups a and g interacted only with native alpha 2m, and those of group c reacted only with alpha 2m-trypsin complex. binding of alpha 2m to group a streptococci was saturable and reversible. the dissociation constant was 2.02 x 10(-7) m, and  the number of binding sites was calculated to be 18,000 per streptococcus. the alpha 2m-binding protein could be solubilized by treatment of group a streptococci with a murolytic enzyme and subsequently purified by affinity chromatography and high-pressure liquid chromatography. the purified protein was  homogeneous on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and had  a molecular weight of 78,000. it possessed no proteolytic activity and interacted with native alpha 2m in western blots (immunoblots). interaction of purified binding protein with alpha 2m led to a change in the conformation of alpha 2m similar to that obtained by alpha 2m-protease complexes. reversible binding of a  nonproteolytic streptococcal component of alpha 2m is thus a novel feature of alpha 2m reactivity.

TI  == a two-center review of bacteremia in the community hospital.
AB  == there are fewer studies on bacteremia coming from the community hospital, where the practicing family physician is likely to see this problem, than from the university hospital. the hypothesis of this study was that patterns of bacteremia would be different between the two types of hospitals. two hundred four patient episodes of culture-proven bacteremia from two analogous community hospitals were reviewed. bacteremia was discovered in 2.6 of 1,000 patients, which is lower than reports from university hospitals. of the 213 organisms isolated, slightly more were gram-negative than gram-positive, whereas many tertiary care centers report  a preponderance of gram-negative organisms. about 20 percent of the episodes of bacteremia ended in death, a rate lower than in many tertiary care centers, and slightly more patients died of gram-negative than gram-positive bacteremia. the most common organisms in descending order were the streptococci and escherichia coli followed by staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus species, and streptococcus pneumoniae. the most common sources of bacteremia were, in decreasing order, urinary tract, source unknown, heart valve, and lung. the most  common underlying disorders were, in decreasing order, malignancy, diabetes mellitus, complicated urinary tract infection, valvular heart disease, and postoperative infection. correctness of treatment of bacteremia appeared to increase survival.

TI  == streptococcal diseases worldwide: present status and prospects.
AB  == infections caused by streptococci pathogenic for man are some of the most common  bacterial diseases in temperate zones and occur very frequently in tropical and subtropical countries. the highest morbidity occurs from infections caused by group a streptococci; these infections can lead to rheumatic fever and acute glomerulonephritis. the incidence of rheumatic fever and the prevalence of rheumatic heart disease are several times higher in tropical countries than temperate countries.recent developments in fundamental and applied research are throwing light on various aspects of the problem, e.g., the rapid (non-culture) identification of group a streptococcal infection. analyses of the chemical structure of the m-protein molecule of group a streptococcus and of the biological properties of the epitopes of the m-protein have provided encouraging  results. furthermore, synthetic analogues of the protective immunodominant polypeptides of the m-protein have been prepared. the prospect of a streptococcal vaccine for preventing group a streptococcal diseases is thus more realistic.the  control of infections caused by group b streptococci is important for the health  of neonates. the identification of the chemical structure of the major group b streptococcal types may lead to development of a vaccine in the future. an alternative approach would entail the use of anti-group-b immunoglobulins, but a  number of questions have to be answered before the new control measures can be introduced. the streptococci causing bacterial pneumonia, subacute bacterial endocarditis and possibly dental caries have been widely studied and promising advances have been made towards the introduction of better control of the diseases caused by these pathogens.

TI  == modulation of complement fixation and the phlogistic capacity of group a, b, and  d streptococci by human lysozyme acting on their cell walls.
AB  == streptococci and streptococcal cell wall fragments induce arthritis in rats, with the severity and duration depending on the capacity of the cells or cell fragments to resist degradation by tissue enzymes. their phlogogenic effects are  apparently related to their ability to activate the alternate complement pathway  (acp). the in vitro activation of the acp by lysozyme-treated cells and cell walls of group a, b, and d streptococci suggests that both rat and human lysozyme can modulate this activity, i.e., increasing it, decreasing it, or doing both in  that order. the effects of the lysozymes also correlated with the degree to which they can unmask the aminosugar-reducing groups detectable in a given amount of cell wall, which suggests that partial depolymerization of the cell wall is critical for acp activation. the effects of mutanolysin and c phage lysin on acp  activation were found to be correlated with their action on streptococcal cell walls. neuraminidase had relatively little effect on acp activation by most streptococcal strains tested. we conclude that the participation of tissue enzymes, including but not necessarily limited to lysozyme, is an important determinant for the clinical arthritis induced by group a, b, or d streptococci.  experimental arthritis induced in rats with whole (or disrupted) streptococci may depend both on the capacities of the cell walls to activate the acp and on the capacities of the host tissue enzymes to modulate this activation. great severity and long durations of the disease were determined by the capacity of the enzymes  to degrade cell wall antigens to a degree sufficient to ensure efficient activation of the acp without completely degrading the material so that it no longer activates complement. in this model, the limited resistance of group b peptidoglycan to lysozyme was a critical pathogenic factor.

AB  == using haemolysis in gel, two bacterial igg-binding substances, an fc-receptor isolated from group a streptococci type m15, and protein a from staphylococcus aureus, were shown to inhibit complement-mediated lysis of sheep erythrocytes sensitized with rabbit igg. when the crude alkaline extracts of ten types of group a streptococci were tested to see whether streptococcal components other than fc-binding material might affect lysis, the degree of inhibition was found to be correlated with fc-binding activity. in no case was the lysis of igm-coated cells inhibited. opsonophagocytosis experiments showed that both purified streptococcal fc-receptor and protein a impaired antibody complement-dependent killing by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes of each of two strains of group b streptococci (lacking igg fc-receptors). furthermore, the impairment was ascribable to interference with the fixation of complement to the antibodies, as  demonstrated in pre-opsonization experiments with one of the strains. our results suggest that blocking of the binding of complement to igg is an important virulence mechanism in fc-receptor-bearing streptococci and staphylococci.

AB  == of 155 highlands children with purulent culture-positive meningitis studied from  march 1980 to september 1984, 84% were aged twelve months or less and 92% were infected with either haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae or both organisms. other pathogens were neisseria meningitidis (8 isolations), streptococcus pyogenes (2 isolations) and streptococcus agalactiae and klebsiella species (1 of each). among h. influenzae isolates, serotype b strains predominated (83%) and most (96%) belonged to biotype i or ii. infections due to  non-b haemophili included serotype a (9 strains), serotype f (1 strain) and non-serotypable variants (3 strains). of 67 s. pneumoniae strains 22% were resistant to benzylpenicillin, with minimal inhibitory concentrations of 0.1-1.0  micrograms/ml. the commonest serotypes were types 5 (11 isolates), type 7 (9 isolates) and types 2, 6 and 46 (6 of each). no resistance to chloramphenicol was detected in either h. influenzae or s. pneumoniae and only one of 56 strains of h. influenzae was insensitive to betalactam antibiotics. the known case fatality  rate in this study was 37%. more children with pneumococcal infection died (46%)  than those with haemophilus infection (30%), though the difference was not statistically significant; 79% of all deaths occurred in children aged less than  twelve months. there is an urgent need for h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae vaccines that are effective in young children.

TI  == the throat carrier rate of group a and other beta hemolytic streptococci among patients in general practice.
AB  == in a one-year multicenter study in general practice the rate of asymptomatic throat carriage of group a beta hemolytic streptococci (gabhs) was investigated.  2,626 patients, none of whom had had sore throat or any other streptococcal illness during the preceding three months, were evaluated. the gabhs carrier rate was 2.2% with no sex or season dependent variation, and it was 10.9% in patients  less than or equal to 14 years of age, 2.3% in patients between 15 and 44 years old, and 0.6% in patients greater than or equal to 45 years old. an additional 7.2% of the patients carried beta hemolytic streptococci of groups b, c, or g. for groups c and g the influence of age on carrier rates was similar to that found for gabhs. tetracycline resistance was found in 21% of the group a strains, in 61% of the group b strains, and in 28% of the group c and group g strains.

TI  == the detection of streptococcal antigens using monoclonal antibodies.
AB  == recent advances in hybridoma technology have allowed the development of homogeneous immunologic reagents of defined specificity, activity, and reproducibility. during the last few years, the number of monoclonal antibodies directed against bacteria has increased exponentially, and research investigations have focused on the use of monoclonal antibodies for the diagnosis and therapy of infectious diseases. monoclonal antibody technology offers a rapid, specific diagnosis of bacterial infection, long before culture results are available. we have described the use of monoclonal antibodies for the detection of group b streptococcal (gbs) infections in mothers and infants at risk to develop invasive gbs disease. specifically, we have used the anti-gbs monoclonal  antibodies to detect gbs colonization, serotype bacterial isolates in the laboratory, and identify gbs antigens in body fluid specimens. we have also discussed the use of anti-gbs monoclonal antibodies to confer protection against  fatal infection in mice. monoclonal antibodies against group a streptococcus and  streptococcus pneumoniae have also been developed with the potential for the rapid diagnosis of serious and often life-threatening infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. with further refinements in monoclonal antibody technology in the future, streptococcal hybridomas may replace standard culture techniques for bacterial identification in the microbiology laboratory.

TI  == molecular genetics of resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin b  (mls) in streptococci.
AB  == resistance to macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin b (mls phenotype) appears in  almost all streptococcal species isolated from man. genes coding for mls resistance are located on plasmids and one mls resistance transposon has been described. mls resistance genes have also been found in a large number of plasmid-free strains. plasmids of 17 to 20 megadaltons (mdal) that code either for mls or for both mls and chloramphenicol resistance are found in streptococci  of groups a, b, c, d (streptococcus faecalis) and g. these plasmids have broad host ranges (conjugative intraspecies, interspecies and intergeneric transfer), display similar restriction enzyme patterns and share a considerable degree of homology (78 to 95%). one smaller non-conjugative mls resistance plasmid has been isolated from str. sanguis (4.5 mdal). in group d (str. faecalis, str. faecium) streptococci, mls resistance genes are also found on plasmids that carry other antibiotic resistance (tetracycline, chloramphenicol, high-levels of streptomycin and kanamycin). these multi-resistance plasmids are either conjugative or non-conjugative and are of various sizes and molecular species and those that have been tested have narrow host-ranges. the mls resistance genes of one multi-resistant plasmid, isolated from a strain of str. faecalis, are located on  a transposon of 3.3 mdal, tn917. hybridization studies, with mls determinants as  probes, reveal homologies among various plasmid-borne mls resistance sequences. elements that are thought to be chromosome-borne mediate multiple antibiotic resistance (including mls) in streptococci of groups a, b, c, d (str. bovis), f,  g, str. pneumoniae, str. mitis, str. sanguis and str. milleri. strains harbouring such elements contain no detectable plasmid dna. in some of the strains these elements are conjugative; their resistance markers transfer en bloc at low frequency and display narrow host ranges. such elements, from str. pyogenes and str. agalactiae, were found to translocate onto various streptococcal haemolysin-bacteriocin plasmids.

TI  == effect of atmosphere of incubation on the isolation of group a streptococci from  throat cultures.
AB  == the optimal atmosphere of incubation for the isolation of group a beta-hemolytic  streptococci from throat cultures has been the subject of considerable debate. to resolve this issue, we examined 5992 consecutive throat cultures performed at a private pediatric office in children with acute upper respiratory tract infections. all throat cultures were streaked onto duplicate blood agar plates, one of which was then incubated anaerobically and the other aerobically. beta-hemolytic streptococci were isolated in cultures from 1885 (31.5%) of the patients; 1479 (24.7%) were identified as group a, and 406 (6.8%) were identified as non-group a. group a streptococci were recovered significantly more often from the plates incubated anaerobically than from those incubated aerobically (1467 vs. 1054; anaerobic only, 425; aerobic only, 12; p less than 0.01). non-group a streptococci were also recovered significantly more often from the plates incubated anaerobically than from the plates incubated aerobically (397 vs. 170;  anaerobic only, 236; aerobic only, 9;p less than 0.01). anaerobic incubation maximizes the yield of the throat culture. the additional cost and effort of anaerobic incubation are small, and would appear to be justified by the increased isolation rate of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci. the significance of the increased isolation rate of non-group a beta-hemolytic streptococci with anaerobic incubation needs to be investigated further.

(great britain) and difco laboratories (usa). the physico-chemical and physiological characteristics of the proposed medium have been determined. the use of the new dried culture medium in medical practice will make it possible to  improve the microbiological diagnosis of streptococcal infections.

AB  == autoantigenic events in acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (apsgn) may result from neuraminidase-induced alterations in immunoglobulin levels. whether streptococci from patients with apsgn produced neuraminidase and, if so, what substrates could be used for screening purposes and what were of potential clinical relevance were determined. group a streptococci cultured from 20 patients with apsgn and four patients with acute rheumatic fever and group b, c,  d, and g streptococci cultured from other individuals were reacted with the substrates to determine neuraminidase activity by the thiobarbituric acid assay.  neuraminidase production was detected in 16 of 20 streptococci from patients with apsgn. partial purification by sephadex g-150 chromatography gave two peaks, and  polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gave two bands with neuraminidase activity. bovine mucin was the most useful substrate to detect neuraminidase production by  nephritogenic streptococci, and with respect to human substrates, igm was the most sensitive and renal basement membrane the least sensitive to enzyme action.

TI  == [microbiology of streptococcal infections].
AB  == since the discovery of streptococci by the surgeon of vienna, theodor billroth, more than 100 years ago, they have proved to be a bacterial group of great medical and epidemiological importance. the classification in growth-characteristics on blood culture mediums (alpha-, beta- and gamma-hemolysis) has been detached by the evidence of group specific cell wall antigens. the antigene extraction described by lancefield can distinguish at least 21 serogroups (a-t). they have also taken over the historical names (s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae etc.). in addition to group relationship the antigen structure of the streptococci cell wall (carbohydrates, peptidoglycanes, m-t-r-proteins and others) is responsible for antigenetic and pathogenetic conditions. some species of streptococci do also excrete exotoxines (streptolysin, hyaluronidase, bacteriocines, erythrogenic toxins) with antigenetic and pathogenetic significance. infections with streptococci of the serogroup a, b, d and h are numerously and medically significant. there is a great interest in infections due to a streptococci (pharygitis, impetigo, erysipel, scarlatin fever). the known non-purulent diseases following a streptococci infections (acute rheumatoid fever, acute glomerulonephritis) are streptococcal specific reactions for the individual. some antigens of the cell wall and also some exotoxines react in human beings as autoantigenes. human beings are the most important reservoir for streptococci. nearly 20% of a population have a streptococci in their upper respiratory tract.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == fibrinogen binding inhibits the fixation of the third component of human complement on surface of groups a, b, c, and g streptococci.
AB  == effects of fibrinogen binding to m protein-positive and -negative streptococci on fixation of the third component of human complement (c3) were determined. in all  test cultures of serological groups a, b, c, and g fixation of c3 was observed in normal human serum as revealed by quantitative fluorescent immunoassay. fibrinogen binding inhibited the fixation of c3 on streptococci. the degree of inhibition was proportional to the extent of fibrinogen binding. thus, inhibition of c3 fixation was most pronounced in strongly fibrinogen-positive streptococci of groups a, c, and g and not demonstrable in fibrinogen-negative cultures of groups c and g. trypsinization of the streptococci destroyed their capacity to bind fibrinogen and consequently the inhibitory effects on c3 fixation. the carboxymethylated alpha and beta chains of fibrinogen moderately inhibited c3 fixation whereas gamma chain had no influence. these studies may indicate that fibrinogen binding structures other than m protein could also be involved in streptococcal pathogenicity.

TI  == mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  == vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. it also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. there is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits  ribonucleic acid synthesis. induction of bacterial l-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. stable l-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to  vancomycin. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant  strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), str. pyogenes, str. agalactiae, str. bovis, str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species and lactobacillus species. there has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against staph. aureus, str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. the combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of staph. epidermidis. it shows indifference against enterococci. vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against staph. aureus.

AB  == the ratio of teichoic acid to lipoteichoic acid (lta) in a strain of streptococcus agalactiae type iii was found to be 8:1, with the total amount of lta being 0.1% of the dry weight of the organism. purified teichoic acid contained d-alanine and possibly a small amount of d-glucose and was approximately 22 glycerol phosphate units in length. the linkage between each of  these units was 1-3. in addition, lta contained a complex lipid, more glucose, and an unusually high content of a short-chain fatty acid, tridecanoic acid. this lta was cytotoxic for a variety of human cell monolayers in tissue culture, including one derived from the human central nervous system. established human cells were more sensitive than primary cell monolayers to this lta, with as little as 12.5 micrograms of lta per ml being cytotoxic for hela cells. teichoic  acid (250 micrograms/ml) was nontoxic under identical conditions. these cytotoxicity results suggest an lta involvement in group b streptococcal pathogenesis. also, the first model system for the study of group b streptococcal adherence to primary human embryonic amnion cells in tissue culture is detailed.  this system was used to quantitate pronounced differences in tissue tropism between s. agalactiae and streptococcus pyogenes and showed enhanced binding by this group a coccus over that of s. agalactiae for amnion cell monolayers. the adherence of both streptococcal species to only a portion (40%) of these amnion cells suggested that host cell receptor expression may vary for primary cells in  vitro. finally, this strain of s. agalactiae was shown to adhere to amnion cells  by a non-lta-mediated mechanism. the possibility of an lta-mediated versus a protein-mediated adherence mechanism for host cells that is related to the virulence of s. agalactiae is discussed.

TI  == [conjugational plasmid transfer from a, b and h streptococci to n streptococci].
AB  == plasmid-mediated resistance to erythromycin and chloramphenicol was successfully  transferred from group a, b and h streptococci to group n streptococci by a process akin to conjugation. the results showed that plasmids from streptococcal  groups other than n were able to replicate in lactic streptococci as well. the transfer experiments were carried out by using a membrane filter mating technique. four of the five plasmids used (psm15346, psm10419, pip501, and pel1)  were transferred at frequencies ranging from 10(-1) to 10(-8) transconjugants per donor colony-forming unit. the highest transfer frequencies were obtained when s. pyogenes strain 15346 (psm15346) served as the donor strain. the identy of transconjugants was verified by testing for the presence of unselected markers of the recipient strains, and both transduction and transformation were ruled out as the mechanisms of transfer.

TI  == polysaccharide storage in different streptococci.
AB  == calf serum, pooled human plasma, polyvinylpyrollidones (pvp) and polyethylene glycols (peg) were required as medium components by many cultures of group a.s. pyogenes for intracellular polysaccharide accumulation. these supplements produced a stabilizing effect, probably at the cell surface, and were not associated with nutrition during intracellular iodophilic polysaccharide (ips) storage. medium stabilization and the presence of maltose or maltose yielding polysaccharides was found to be a property unique to the group a streptococci. cariogenic streptococci and streptococcus agalactive did not require medium stabilization for ips storage although addition of pvp or peg was stimulatory. different degrees of ips storage in group a.s. pyogenes was found to be strain related and probably dependent on the size and degree of branching of the storage polymer.

AB  == the virulence of beta-hemolytic and non-hemolytic strains of streptococcus mutans was studied in neonatal mice by ld50 determinations after intracerebral injection of the bacteria. although the differences in ld50 values are small the results may indicate that beta-hemolytic s. mutans strains (mean ld50 of 6.3 x 10(7) c.f.u.) were more virulent than non-hemolytic s. mutans strains (mean ld50 of 47.7 x 10(7) c.f.u.). the ld50 values of other viridans streptococci varied between 4.8 and 10(7) c.f.u. strains of s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae were highly virulent in this animal model with ld50 values lower than 10(5) c.f.u.

TI  == identification of a streptococcal penicillin-binding protein that reacts very slowly with penicillin.
AB  == penicillin-binding protein (pbp) 5 of streptococcus faecium atcc 9790 has an unusually low affinity for penicillin (50% binding occurred at a penicillin level of 8 micrograms/ml after 60 min of incubation, and the protein only became labeled after 20 min of incubation with high concentrations of radioactive penicillin). pbps with similar properties are carried by strains of streptococcus durans, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus lactis but not by strains of groups a, b, c, and g streptococci or streptococcus pneumoniae. the strains carrying the slow-reacting pbp demonstrated a sensitivity to penicillin that was  several hundred times lower than that of strains not carrying it. spontaneous mutants with minimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin of 20, 40, and 80 micrograms/ml were isolated from s. faecium atcc 9790. they all showed a dramatic increase in the amount of slow-reacting pbp produced. mutants with increased penicillin resistance were also isolated from wild-type strains of s. durans, s.  faecalis, and s. faecium. all of them carried a greater amount of the slow-reacting pbp than that carried by the parent. finally, it was found that resistant s. faecium atcc 9790 mutants grew normally in the presence of penicillin concentrations that were far above that saturating all pbps except pbp 5. cell growth was, on the contrary, inhibited by a penicillin concentration that saturated the slow-reacting pbp by 90%. this penicillin dose was equal to the minimal inhibitory concentration.

TI  == [stimulation of human and bovine lymphocytes by various streptococcus species].
AB  == concerning the question of species specifity of lymphokines in the presented examination the effect of the leukocyte migration inhibition factor (lif) secreted by human and bovine lymphocytes was tested using pmn leukocytes of man and different animal species as indicator cells. the method was the so called indirect leukocyte migration inhibition test according to clausen. as antigens for stimulating the lymphocytes cell wall preparations of group a- and b-streptococci and as a mitogen concanavalin a was used. from the results the following facts can be stated: --human lif has no inhibiting effect on the migration of leukocytes from cattle, sheep and pigs--independent of the way of stimulation by specific antigens or by the mitogen. --a corresponding factor to human lif can be demonstrated from bovine lymphocytes which, however, inhibits only the migration of bovine indicator cells. this phenomenon is also independent of the kind of stimulation. --migration inhibiting substances from bovine lymphocytes are only produced after stimulation with group a- and b-streptococci  cell walls if the donor animals have been sensitized with these antigens. --the interaction between lif and indicator leukocytes obviously is dependent on host specifity and not on a peculiar relation of macro- and microorganisms.

TI  == rat arthritis due to whole group b streptococci. clinical and histopathologic features compared with groups a and d.
AB  == heat-killed streptococci of groups a, b, and d injected intraperitoneally into sprague-dawley rats induced arthritis. the histopathologic features of the arthritis were those of erosive synovitis. early acute lesions were associated with deposits of streptococcal antigens. the serogroups and the physical state of the streptococci determined the incidence, the time of onset, the duration, and the severity of the disease, the severity being a blend of degree of inflammation, tendency to relapse, and occurrence of ankylosis. whole group a usually failed to induce arthritis. group a disrupted with sonication regularly induced arthritis after a 24-hour latent period. the disease lasted over 60 days  and caused ankylosis. whole group b regularly induced arthritis but only after a  latent period of 6-8 days. the disease lasted over 40 days and caused ankylosed joints. with sonicated group b a similar disease was induced, except that, as with sonicated group a, the latent period was 24 hours. whole group d induced disease after a latent period of 48 hours. the arthritis lasted only 2 weeks and  was transient. in contrast to its effects on group a and b cocci, sonication of group d abrogated its capacity to induce arthritis. it is postulated that for whole streptococci, in contrast to sonicated streptococci, arthritogenicity depends on the sensitivity of the cocci to initial processing in vivo. processing may be partial digestion by enzymes of phagocytes. cocci such as those of group a that are insensitive to processing, injected whole, tend not to cause arthritis,  but when they do cause disease, it is chronic. a coccus, such as one of group d,  that is very sensitive to processing produces a transient arthritis after a short latent period, while a coccus of intermediate sensitivity, such as one of group b, induces disease only after a substantial latent period, and the disease is severe and chronic. the nature of processing remains to be determined.

AB  == the specificity and sensitivity of agglutination, complement fixation, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) procedures in the detection of antibodies to haemophilus somnus was investigated. h. somnus rabbit immune sera were found to agglutinate pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus aureus, and haemophilus agni and, in some instances, also pasteurella haemolytica, salmonella dublin, streptococcus agalactiae, and corynebacterium pyogenes. in complement fixation tests with saline extracts as antigens, only h. agni reacted with h. somnus antisera to any significant degree. in elisa tests with sonicated or heat-extracted antigens, cross-reactions were seen with the two pasteurella spp.  and with h. agni. when whole cells and saline extracts were used as antigens in elisas, only h. agni showed any cross-reactivity. the greatest specificity in distinguishing homologous from heterologous reactions was achieved by elisa with  saline extracts as antigens. escherichia coli and brucella abortus antigens failed to react with h. somnus antibody in any of the tests. a rabbit serum containing antibody to bovine type isolates of p. multocida, p. haemolytica, s. aureus, s. agalactiae, s. dublin, c. pyogenes, and e. coli gave no positive reaction in elisa tests with saline extract of h. somnus as antigen. it is concluded that such saline extract, which appears to consist largely of h. somnus common antigen, has the potential of being a useful diagnostic reagent in the study by elisa of antibody response to h. somnus.

TI  == platelet aggregation by streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == heat-killed group a streptococcus pyogenes induced platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma. aggregation was dependent upon the ratio of platelets to bacteria, with maximal aggregation occurring at 0.8 platelets per bacterium (final concentration, 300,000 per microliter). inhibition of the reaction by 3 mm edta indicated it was a true aggregation and not merely adhesion and agglutination. lactic acid dehydrogenase assays indicated lysis of platelets did  not occur during a 6-min incubation period. aggregation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by acetylsalicylic acid (100 microm to 10 mm) and quinacrine (15.6 to 250 microm), with no decrease in aggregation at the lowest concentration of inhibitor tested. s. pyogenes induced the release of [14c]serotonin, which was maximal (50%) at 2.4 min, when aggregation was nearly complete. gel-filtered platelets were not aggregated unless fibrinogen (final concentration, 1.8 mg/ml) was included in the reaction mixture. staphylococcus aureus, a group b streptococcus, and escherichia coli were unable to induce aggregation in platelet-rich plasma under the conditions used for s. pyogenes.

AB  == a test is described that could replace bacitracin susceptibility for presumptive  identification of group a streptococci as well as 6.5% nacl agar tolerance for presumptive identification of enterococcal streptococci. the l-pyrrolidonyl-beta-naphthylamide test, based on hydrolysis of pyrrolidonyl-beta-naphthylamide, was used in conjunction with the camp and bile-esculin tests to presumptively identify the streptococci. among the beta-hemolytic streptococci; 98% of 50 group a, 98% of 46 group b, and 100% of 70 strains that were not group a, b, or d were correctly identified by the new presumptive test scheme. among the non-beta-hemolytic streptococci; 96% of 74 group d enterococcal, 100% of 30 group d nonenterococcal, and 82% of 112 viridans strains were correctly identified by the new presumptive test scheme.

TI  == the antibacterial action of vancomycin.
AB  == vancomycin inhibits the second stage of cell wall synthesis in susceptible bacteria. furthermore, there is evidence that vancomycin also alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits ribonucleic acid synthesis. stable l-phase variants are susceptible to vancomycin, but induction of bacterial l-phase variants with vancomycin is very difficult. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive cocci and bacilli, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (including multiply resistant strains). streptococcus  pneumoniae (including multiply resistant strains), streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus bovis, viridans group streptococcus, enterococcus, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species, and lactobacillus species. antimicrobial activity can be enhanced with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against s. aureus, s. bovis, enterococcus, and viridans streptococcus. the combination of vancomycin and rifampin also has enhanced activity against s. aureus.

TI  == mannitol agar for microbiologic diagnosis of bovine mastitis.
AB  == a medium containing mannitol (mannitol agar) was developed and evaluated as a tool for the microbiologic diagnosis of bovine mastitis. mannitol agar supported  growth of all important bacterial mastitis pathogens (staphylococci, streptococci, coliforms, and pseudomonads) except corynebacterium pyogenes. color change around colonies in the agar permitted the differentiation of pathogenic from nonpathogenic staphylococci. most staphylococcus aureus strains and some staphylococcus epidermidis strains produced yellow zones. these yellow zone-producing strains (mannitol fermenters) of staphylococci were obtained from  quarters with significantly elevated (p less than 0.05) somatic cell counts (scc) in the milk, as compared with uninfected quarters and, therefore, would be considered pathogens. mannitol-negative strains of s epidermidis (those with red  zones) were obtained from quarters with scc similar to those of uninfected quarters. the streptococci could be divided into 2 groups on the basis of color change around the colonies: streptococcus agalactiae, str dysgalactiae, and group g streptococci produced red zones; str uberis, str bovis, and enterococci produced yellow zones. pathogenic streptococci (str agalactiae, str dysgalactiae, str uberis, and group g streptococci) were obtained from quarters with scc significantly higher (p less than 0.01) than those of uninfected quarters. streptococcus bovis and enterococci were obtained from quarters with scc similar  to those of uninfected quarters and were considered nonpathogenic. pathogenic streptococci were found in much higher concentration than nonpathogenic streptococci and could be differentiated on that basis.

TI  == synergism, killing kinetics, and antimicrobial susceptibility of group a and b streptococci.
AB  == the susceptibility of 110 group a and 179 group b streptococci to 25 antimicrobics was tested by broth microdilution and agar disk diffusion tests. representative strains were used in killing kinetics, penicillin-gentamicin synergy, and minimal bactericidal concentration tests. group a streptococci were  more susceptible than group b streptococci to 17 of the 25 antimicrobics tested.  group a and b streptococci were killed at the same rate if the amount of penicillin used was equivalent to their respective penicillin minimal inhibitory  concentrations. synergism was demonstrated for both group a and b streptococci when penicillin was used at concentrations equal to each respective minimal inhibitory concentration and subinhibitory concentration of gentamicin. this synergy could be demonstrated best using minimal bactericidal concentrations obtained by culturing 3- and 6-h cultures from the microdilution checkerboard tests rather than from 24-h subcultures. a greater synergistic effect was achieved by adding penicillin first and then adding gentamicin rather than in the reverse order, or simultaneously.

TI  == in vitro activity of ly127935.
AB  == ly127935 is a unique new beta-lactam antibiotic. its activity against 536 clinical isolates was studied by using microdilution methods of susceptibility testing and compared with the activities of cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cephalothin. the lowest concentrations required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (mic(90)s) of ly127935 for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae ranged from 2 to 8 mug/ml. the mic(90)s for other staphylococci and streptococci were higher. the  mic(90)s for enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas species ranged from 0.12 to 8 mug/ml and 8 to >32 mug/ml, respectively. the mic(90)s for anaerobes ranged from  2 to >32 mug/ml. as determined by mic(90)s, ly127935 was consistently the least active antibiotic against facultatively anaerobic gram-positive cocci and the most active against aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. its position with respect to activity against anaerobes varied from being the most active against bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens to the least active against anaerobic cocci. in a population of multidrug-resistant isolates,  concentrations of 8 mug or less of ly127935 per ml inhibited 82% of enterobacteriaceae; concentrations of 32 mug or less per ml inhibited 100% of enterobacteriaceae and 40% of p. aeruginosa. increasing the inoculum size by 100-fold did not increase the minimal inhibitory concentrations of ly127935 or cefoxitin but did increase minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefamandole and cephalothin for some enterobacteriaceae. all four drugs were bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations were the same or one concentration higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations for 91 to 96% of strains tested. the broad spectrum and marked in vitro activity of ly127935 make it a promising new antibiotic.

TI  == [localization of group a streptococcal nontype-specific antigens and their occurrence among streptococci of different groups].
AB  == it was shown by immunodiffusion methods that nontypespecific antigens revealed in the hcl extracts of streptococcus, group a, were localized in the cell wall. in b, e, h, k, l, m, p, s, t streptococci groups there was revealed only one, and in c and g streptococci groups--two antigens identical to the htc antigens of streptococci, group a. besides, an antigen, which was apparently specific specific for group a streptococcus only, was detected. the data obtained should be taken into consideration in the elaboration of improved method of grouping and typing group a streptococcus.

TI  == non-group d streptococcal meningitis misidentified as enterococcal meningitis. diagnostic and therapeutic implications of misdiagnosis by screening microbiology.
AB  == two patients had nonhemolytic gram-positive coccal meningitis. both pathogens were initially misidentified as a group d enterococcus by growth in "selective" media, which led to the use of inappropriate and potentially toxic systemic and intrathecal aminoglycosides. careful evaluation of the antibiotic sensitivity data and additional microbiological studies allowed correct identification of the organism. the important diagnostic and therapeutic considerations in differentiating true enterococcal infections, especially meningitis, from those caused by other alpha-hemolytic or nonhemolytic streptococci are emphasized. a simple laboratory schema for rapid recognition of such pathogens is reviewed.

AB  == tympanocentesis was performed on 70 infants who had otitis media during the first six weeks of life. the bacteria isolated from their middle-ear effusions were streptococcus pneumoniae (13 patients), neisseria catarrhalis (11 patients), hemophilus influenzae (ten patients), enterobacteriaceae (four patients), staphylococcus aureus (four patients), streptococci (groups a and b) (three patients), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (two patients). thirty patients (42.9%) had middle-ear effusions which did not contain pathogenic bacteria. twenty-seven infants were followed for at least 12 months and 12 (44.4%) of these infants had  six or more episodes of otitis media during the observation period. further studies will be needed to establish the significance of middle-ear disease at this age and the role of therapy in improving its outcome.

TI  == bacitracin and coagglutination for grouping of beta-hemolytic streptococci.
AB  == bacitracin may be used for presumptive differentiation of group a from other beta-hemolytic streptococci. whatever criteria are used for the test, a small number of erroneous results will be obtained. with the 1,161 strains studied in this laboratory, using a zone of 10 mm or greater as indicative of group a was better than using maxted's original criterion of any zone of inhibition for group a. co-agglutination is a preferable alternative to bacitracin testing, providing  a grouping result as quickly as the bacitracin test but with the advantage of giving a definite grouping result. with the 247 strains studied so far, coagglutination results have correlated exactly with results of conventional grouping by a precipitin method.

AB  == two patients were initially seen with culture-positive streptococcal arthritis as an early manifestation of bacterial endocarditis. the organisms were an alpha-hemolytic, nongroup d streptococcus and a beta-hemolytic, group b streptococcus. one patient had a persistent septic monarthritis; the other had migratory arthritis in which a positive synovial culture was followed by a negative culture from the same joint before antimicrobial treatment was started.  this experience suggests that some sterile synovial aspirates encountered in patients with bacterial endocarditis may be explained by delay of arthrocentesis.

AB  == grouping of beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates by staphylococcal coagglutination was performed with the phadebact streptococcus test to determine  whether such isolates could be accurately grouped serologically with 4 h after examination of the primary isolation plates. of 132 clinical isolates, 131 were correctly grouped by the phadebact method using the lancefield precipitation method as the accepted standard. of the correctly grouped streptococci, 119 were  definitively grouped within 4 h after examination of the primary plates, and the  remaining 12 isolates were grouped within 24 h. since the phadebact streptococcus test contains coagglutination reagents for groups a, b, c, and g, those isolates  that failed to react were considered as positive for groups other than the four included in the test system. there were 23 such isolates in this study. lancefield grouping of these isolates indicated that nine were group f, five were group d, and the remaining nine were not groupable with the lancefield reagents employed in this study. the one phadebact "failure" involved an isolate that produced a 4 + reaction with the phadebact group a reagent and a 4 + reaction with lancefield group f reagent.

AB  == the colonization of mucosal cells in the oral cavity of newborn infants was studied at various intervals after birth in an attempt to define the nature of the epithelial binding sites for group a streptococci and their lipoteichoic acid (lta). stained smears of buccal mucosal cells showed that the average number of naturally acquired bacteria/cell was zero to one in infants less than one day old, one to four in infants one day old, and 11-19 in infants two days old. samples of the same mucosal cells were incubated with group a streptococci, and the average number of streptococci bound per cell was 10-31 in infants less than  one day old, 33-62 in one-day-old infants, and 75-100 in two-day-old infants. experiments that were repeated with group b streptococci type iii produced similar results. lta, the substance that mediates the binding of streptococci to  epithelial cells, was similarly bound by fewer buccal mucosal cells obtained within 6 hr of birth than cells obtained during the next 48 hr. streptococcal and lta binding reached adult levels between 48 and 72 hr after birth. no difference  was shown in the streptococcal binding capacity of oral epithelial cell obtained  from mothers at term and cells obtained from other normal adults. preincubation of adult buccal cells with amniotic fluid did not decrease streptococcal binding. these studies demonstrated a scant capacity of the oral mucosal cells of neonates to bind lta and streptococci and suggest that lta-binding sites are developed or  unmasked during the first few days after birth.

AB  == a collection of 820 isolates of streptococci and aerococci from human blood or internal organs was classified by means of a set of cultural and biochemical tests. of these, 719 (712 streptococci and 7 aerococci) were from patients believed to be suffering from a systemic infection: endocarditis 317; a purulent  lesion in an internal organ ("purulent disease") 152; bacteriaemia 250. the endocarditis streptococci included members of all recognisable taxa, but only certain of these were common: streptococcus sanguis, 16-4%; dextran-positive and  usually mannitol-fermenting strains of s. bovis (s. bovis i), 15-1%; s. mutans, 14-2%; s. mitior, 13-2%. streptococci of the "alpha-haemolytic" taxa (s. sanguis, s. mitior and related strains) formed only 44-8% of the total. when the percentage frequency of streptococcal taxa among the endocarditis and "non-endocarditis" isolates was compared, the dextran-forming taxa (s. mutans, s. bovis i, s. sanguis, and dextran-positive streptococci otherwise resembling s. mitior) all had higher "endocarditis : non-endocarditis" ratios than did any of the non-dextran-producing taxa. endocarditis increased in frequency with age, and showed an excess of males over females up to the age of 65 years. in young patients (less than 35 years), "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci predominated; with increasing age, the proportion of other streptococci increased progressively but  the absolute numbers of isolations of "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci did not fall. infections with s. mutans were prominent in the age-group 35-54 years and with s. bovis i at ages greater than or equal to 55 years. a history of previous  heart disease was more often obtained in endocarditis due to "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci than in other streptococcal endocarditis. the streptococcus most often isolated from purulent lesions in internal organs was s. milleri (29-3%). it was associated with brain abscess, meningitis, pleural empyema and a variety of intra-abdominal abscesses. the only common predisposing factor in endocarditis was previous heart damage. in other systemic streptococcal diseases, other general or local predisposing causes could be observed, mainly in infections with the "pyogenic" groupable streptococci, the enterococci and s. milleri.

TI  == streptococcal infections--updated.
AB  == streptococci are amont the most common bacterial pathogens physicians encounter in practice. infections with streptococci continue to occur with significant frequency despite the general sensitivity of these organisms to a variety of widely used antibiotics. in newborn infants and other special patient groups, streptococci may produce fulminant and fatal sepsis (table 1). in normal children and adults, infections usually are short term and often mild or unrecognized but  with the possibility of resulting, unpredictably, in nonsuppurative complications some weeks or months later. although scarlet fever has become an unusual and clinically attenuated disease, its rashless analog, streptococcal pharyngitis, presents thorny problems in the differential diagnosis of symptomatic patients and in the detection of subclinical infections. erysipelas now is a rare disease, but recent studies have confirmed that streptococci often are the primary etiologic agent in impetigo, another type of skin infection--with peculiar bacteriologic and epidemiologic features. infections with group d streptococci have always been a special case because of their frequent resistance to penicillin, and group b streptococci (also somewhat resistant) present special problems in the perinatal period. streptococci may appear in unexpected places or guises (see table 1). thus, the modern physician has little reason to relax in his vigilance for and knowledge of streptococcal infections.

AB  == the authors studied the sensitivity of some rather recent products--flucloxacillin, doxycyclin, clindamycin and cotrimoxazol--in correlation with classical penicillin. if therapy by means of classical penicillins is unsuitable, clindamycin and the semi-synthetic penicillin flucloxacillin appear to be a further alternative and the most suitable chemotherapeutic in streptococcal infections.

TI  == cores, microbial organelles possibly specific to group d streptococci.
AB  == a long, thin, approximately cylindrical core spans the interior of cells of 24-hr cultures of all group d streptococci that were examined, five strains of streptococcus faecalis, single strains of s. faecalis subsp. zymogenes and s. durans, and three strains of streptococcus spp. in one strain of s. faecalis, serial section electron microscopy showed that most cells possess a core. the core is 0.10 to 0.16 mum thick and consists of a matrix and an axial array of ribosomelike particles. it resembles one of two types of cores present in a stable protoplast form of one of the s. faecalis strains. cores were not present  in single strains of s. pyogenes (beta-hemolytic group a), s. agalactiae (group b), s. dysgalactiae (group c), s. equisimilis (group c), and s. mitis (viridans group) that were examined; nor were cores observed in single strains of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and bacillus megaterium. cores may be useful, therefore, in identification of group d streptococci. for preservation and rapid recognition of cores, a glutaraldehyde-osmium tetroxide sequence of fixation appears superior to the osmium tetroxide method often employed in processing bacteria for electron microscopy.
