TI  == suppression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication in macrophages by  commensal bacteria preferentially stimulating toll-like receptor 4.
AB  == protection from primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) infection has not yet been accomplished by vaccines inducing hiv-1-specific acquired immunity.  nevertheless, it has been reported that a small subgroup of women remain resistant to hiv-1 infection under natural conditions. if similar conditions can  be induced in uninfected individuals, it will contribute the first line of protection against hiv-1 infection, and also improve the effects of anti-hiv-1 vaccines. we reasoned that innate immunity may be involved in the resistance to hiv-1 infection, and investigated the effects of various toll-like receptor (tlr) ligands and commensal bacteria on hiv-1 replication in macrophages, one of the initial targets of hiv-1 infection and also the main mediators of innate immunity. we established the hiv-1 reporter monocytic cell line, thp-1/nl4-3luc,  which could be differentiated into macrophage-like cells in vitro. in these cells, stimulation of tlr3 and tlr4 by their ligands suppressed hiv-1 expression  partly through type i interferon (ifn). among the commensal bacteria tested, escherichia coli, veillonella parvula and neisseria mucosa suppressed hiv-1 expression, whereas lactobacillus acidophilus, prevotella melaninogenica, p. bivia and mycobacterium smegmatis enhanced it. the bacteria with suppressive effects preferentially stimulated tlr4, whereas the ones with enhancing effects stimulated tlr2. neutralizing antibodies against tlr4 and ifn-alpha/beta receptor abrogated bacterially mediated hiv-1 suppression. suppressive effects of e. coli, v. parvula and n. mucosa on hiv-1 replication were reproducible in primary monocyte-derived macrophages following acute hiv-1 infection. these findings suggest that certain commensal bacteria preferentially stimulating tlr4 potentially produce local environments resistant to hiv-1 infection.

TI  == methods for optimizing dna extraction before quantifying oral bacterial numbers by real-time pcr.
AB  == methods for the optimal extraction of genomic dna for real-time pcr enumeration of oral bacteria using the muramidase, mutanolysin, were developed using a simple in vitro oral flora model comprised of the facultative anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, lactobacillus acidophilus and streptococcus mutans, the gram-positive anaerobe, parvimonas micra, and the gram-negative anaerobes, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica and fusobacterium nucleatum. traditional, as well as more elaborate, methods of quantifying bacterial numbers, including colony counting and estimation of dna content using 4',6-diamino-2-phenylindole were compared in order to validate the real-time pcr approach. evidence was obtained that p. gingivalis nuclease activity adversely affected the extraction of double-stranded dna from this bacterium either alone or when it formed part of a consortium with the other bacteria. this nuclease activity could be overcome by treatment of the bacteria with either 20 mm diethyl pyrocarbonate or 70% ethanol  at 4 degrees c overnight. a final purification of the dna to remove any potential pcr inhibitors was added to the protocol in order to accurately quantify the amount of dna by real-time pcr and hence the number of bacteria in a sample.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis samples from different geographical origins against certain oral pathogens.
AB  == propolis is an agent having antimicrobial properties, however, its composition can vary depending on the area where it is collected. in the present study, the antimicrobial activity of five propolis samples, collected from four different regions in turkey and from brazil, against nine anaerobic strains was evaluated.  ethanol extracts of propolis (eep) were prepared from propolis samples and we determined minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) of eep on the growth of test microorganisms by using agar dilution method. all strains were susceptible and mic values ranged from 4 to 512 microg/ml for propolis activity. propolis from kazan-ankara showed most effective mic values to the studied microorganisms. mbc values of kazan-ankara eep samples  were ranged from 8 to 512 microg/ml. death was observed within 4 h of incubation  for peptostreptococcus anaerobius and micros and lactobacillus acidophilus and actinomyces naeslundii, while 8 h for prevotella oralis and prevotella melaninogenica and porphyromonas gingivalis, 12 h for fusobacterium nucleatum, 16 h for veillonella parvula. it was shown that propolis samples were more effective against gram positive anaerobic bacteria than gram negative ones. the organic chemical compositions of eeps were determined by high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (gc-ms). the main compounds of eeps were flavonoids such as pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine, chrysin and aromatic acids such as cafeic acid. because of increased antimicrobial resistance, propolis may be kept in mind in the treatment of oral cavity diseases.

TI  == salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in sudanese adults.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult sudanese subjects. material and methods: the study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. the periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using whole genomic dna probes. results: a high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or =  105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. between 12% and 16%  of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, c. rectus and e. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, respectively. there were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. presence of > or = 105 l. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). there were significantly higher levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, c. rectus, p. micros, v. parvula, s. mutans, s. anginosus, a. israelii, c. sputigena, and c. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, e. corrodens, l. acidophilus, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. oralis, and s. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. conclusions: : the findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. this is the first report that the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.

TI  == bacterial and fungal microleakage of ah26 and ah plus root canal sealers.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the penetration of candida albicans alone and a combination of bacteria through root canals filled with gutta-percha and one or other root canal sealers, ah26 and ah plus. methodology: eighty teeth were randomly divided into two groups of 40 teeth each and obturated with gutta-percha using either ah26 or  ah plus sealer. a further 10 teeth served as negative controls and 10 as positive controls. the external surface of each root, except the apical 2 mm, was covered  with two layers of nail varnish. the teeth were inserted into eppendorf plastic tubes and suspended in glass bottles containing sterile schaedler broth. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, prevotella melaninogenica and lactobacillus acidophilus were placed in the access cavities of 20 teeth filled with ah26 and 20 with ah plus. candida albicans was placed in the access cavities of the other teeth. the culture medium with microorganisms was changed every 7 days. every 72 h bacterial or fungal growth in the broth was tested up to a period of 90 days. results: leakage in the experimental teeth occurred between 14 and 87 days. leakage was present in 47% of all samples. from the samples with ah26, 45% leaked bacteria and 60% leaked fungi; whilst from the samples with ah plus, 50% leaked bacteria and 55% fungi. there was no statistically significant difference in penetration of bacteria and fungi between the sealers. conclusion:  in this in vitro study, gutta-percha and the sealers ah26 and ah plus allowed leakage of bacteria and fungi.
