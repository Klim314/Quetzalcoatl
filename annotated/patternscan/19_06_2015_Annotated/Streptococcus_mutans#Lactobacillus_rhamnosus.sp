TI  == inhibitory effect of lactobacillus salivarius on streptococcus mutans biofilm formation.
AB  == dental caries arises from an imbalance of metabolic activities in dental biofilms developed primarily by streptococcus mutans. this study was conducted to isolate  potential oral probiotics with antagonistic activities against s. mutans biofilm  formation from lactobacillus salivarius, frequently found in human saliva. we analysed 64 l. salivarius strains and found that two, k35 and k43, significantly  inhibited s. mutans biofilm formation with inhibitory activities more pronounced  than those of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg), a prototypical probiotic that shows anti-caries activity. scanning electron microscopy showed that co-culture of s. mutans with k35 or k43 resulted in significantly reduced amounts of attached bacteria and network-like structures, typically comprising exopolysaccharides. spot assay for s. mutans indicated that k35 and k43 strains possessed a stronger bactericidal activity against s. mutans than lgg. moreover,  quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that the expression of genes encoding glucosyltransferases, gtfb, gtfc, and gtfd was reduced when s. mutans were co-cultured with k35 or k43. however, lgg activated the expression of gtfb and gtfc, but did not influence the expression of gtfd in the co-culture. a  transwell-based biofilm assay indicated that these lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans biofilm formation in a contact-independent manner. in conclusion, we identified two l. salivarius strains with inhibitory activities on the growth and expression of s. mutans virulence genes to reduce its biofilm formation. this is  not a general characteristic of the species, so presents a potential strategy for in vivo alteration of plaque biofilm and caries.

TI  == a comparative study of the effect of probiotics on cariogenic biofilm model for preventing dental caries.
AB  == dental caries is induced by oral biofilm containing streptococcus mutans. probiotic bacteria were mainly studied for effect on the gastrointestinal tract and have been known to promote human health. however, the information of probiotics for oral health has been lack yet. in this study, we investigated influence of various probiotics on oral bacteria or cariogenic biofilm and evaluated candidate probiotics for dental caries among them. the antimicrobial activity of the spent culture medium of probiotics for oral streptococci was performed. probiotics were added during the biofilm formation with salivary bacteria including s. mutans. the oral biofilms were stained with a fluorescent dye and observed using the confocal laser scanning microscope. to count bacteria  in the biofilm, the bacteria were plated on msb and bhi agar plates after disrupting the biofilm and cultivated. glucosyltransferases (gtfs) expression of  s. mutans and integration of lactobacilli into the biofilm were evaluated by real-time rt-pcr. among probiotics, lactobacillus species strongly inhibited growth of oral streptococci. moreover, lactobacillus species strongly inhibited formation of cariogenic biofilm model. the expression of gtfs was significantly reduced by lactobacillus rhamnosus. the integration of l. rhamnosus into the biofilm model did not exhibit. however, l. acidophilus and l casei integrated into the biofilm model. these results suggest that l. rhamnosus may inhibit oral  biofilm formation by decreasing glucan production of s. mutans and antibacterial  activity and did not integrate into oral biofilm, which can be a candidate for caries prevention strategy.

TI  == the effect of five probiotic lactobacilli strains on the growth and biofilm formation of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == objective: to compare the effects of five probiotic lactobacilli strains on the growth and biofilm formation of streptococcus mutans (ms). materials and methods: five probiotic lactobacilli bacteria (lb), lactobacillus casei shirota, lactobacillus casei lc01, lactobacillus plantarum st-iii, lactobacillus paracasei lpc-37, and lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001, were used as test strains effecting on the streptococci strain s. mutans ua159 in this study. the effect of lb strains and their supernatants on the viability of the ms was evaluated. then, the effect of lb strains on the growth of ms biofilm formation was observed by fluorescence  microscope. results: all of the lb strains inhibited the growth of ms at concentrations of 1 x 10(8) and 3 x 10(8) cfu ml(-1) (p < 0.05). untreated (without ph adjustment and ultrafiltration) lb supernatants from all of the lb strains inhibited the growth of ms (p < 0.05) as well. after ph adjustment and ultrafiltration (treated), only supernatants from l. casei shirota and l. rhamnosus hn001 inhibited the growth of ms (p < 0.05). ms biofilm formation was also inhibited by all untreated supernatants and by the treated supernatants of l. casei shirota and l. rhamnosus hn001 (p < 0.05). conclusion: all five probiotic lactobacilli strains inhibited the growth and biofilm formation of ms,  likely through the production of an acid environment, bacteriocin-like poly peptides, or both, and the effects on ms were dependent on the lb strains used.

TI  == cariogenic effects of probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gg in a dental biofilm model.
AB  == probiotic bacteria have been suggested to inhibit streptococcus mutans (sm) and thus prevent dental caries. however, supporting evidence is weak and probiotic species might be cariogenic themselves. thus, we compared and combined the probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg) with sm and analysed the resulting mineral loss (deltaz) in dental tissues. we simulated three biofilm compositions  (sm, lgg, sm x lgg), two lesion sites (smooth enamel, dentin cavity) and two nutrition supply frequencies (twice/day, 6 times/day) in a multi-station, continuous-culture biofilm model. a total of 240 bovine enamel and dentin samples were cut, polished and embedded. all experimental procedures were performed in independent duplicates, with 10 samples being allocated to each group for each experiment (final sample size n = 20/group). biofilms were cultured on the specimens and supplied with 2% sucrose medium and artificial saliva in consecutive pulses. after 10 days, deltaz and bacterial numbers were assessed. sm x lgg biofilms caused significantly increased deltaz compared with sm or lgg biofilms (p < 0.01, mann-whitney test), and deltaz was significantly increased in dentin cavities compared with smooth enamel lesions (p < 0.01). bacterial numbers did not significantly differ between biofilms of different species (p > 0.05, anova). frequent nutrition supply significantly increased bacterial numbers (p <  0.01). biofilms in dentin cavities compared to smooth enamel harboured significantly more bacteria (p < 0.05). lgg induced mineral loss especially in dentin cavities and under highly cariogenic conditions. lgg did not have inhibitory effects on sm, but rather contributed to the caries process in vitro.

TI  == 16s rrna pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of oral lactobacillus casei  group and their phenotypic appearances.
AB  == this study aimed to develop a 16s rrna pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) to identify the species level of lactobacillus casei group and to investigate their characteristics of acid production and inhibitory effect. pcr-dgge has been developed based on the 16s rrna gene, and a set of hda-1-gc and hda-2, designed at v2-v3 region, and another set of carp-1-gc and carp-2, designed at v1 region, have been used. the bacterial strains included l.  casei atcc 393, l. paracasei ccug 32212, l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, l. zeae ccug 35515, and 46 clinical strains of l. casei/paracasei/rhamnosus. inhibitory effect against streptococcus mutans and acid production were examined. results revealed  that each type species strain and identified clinical isolate showed its own unique dgge pattern using carp1-gc and carp2 primers. hda1-gc and hda2 primers could distinguish the strains of l. paracasei from l. casei. it was found that inhibitory effect of l. paracasei was stronger than l. casei and l. rhamnosus. the acid production of l. paracasei was lower than l. casei and l. rhamnosus. in  conclusion, the technique has been proven to be able to differentiate between closely related species in l. casei group and thus provide reliable information of their phenotypic appearances.

TI  == antimicrobial and safety properties of lactobacilli isolated from two cameroonian traditional fermented foods.
AB  == twenty-one lactobacillus isolates from "sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. these isolates were preliminarily identified as lactobacillus plantarum (62%), lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-pcr genomic fingerprinting. twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, proteinase k) and inhibition of other lactobacillus spp. these  bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin g, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. the bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria,  several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the world health organization, as well as multidrug-resistant strains. these include staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare typhi, bacillus cereus, streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella pneumoniae and shigella flexneri. these lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine, listerine and fluoride listerine mouthrinses on four putative root-caries pathogens in the biofilm.
AB  == objective: to investigate the effects of chlorhexidine (chx), listerine and fluoride listerine on putative root-caries pathogens in the biofilm in the artificial mouth model. methods: a total of 24 human dentine discs were prepared. a biofilm composed of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus rhamnosus and actinomyces naeslundii was cultured on the surfaces of human dentine discs in an artificial-mouth model. sucrose was supplied by computer-controlled release on a daily basis to simulate the real-life situation. three treatment reagents, chx, listerine and fluoride listerine, were supplied at a flow rate of 15 ml/h for 6 min twice a day. the dentine discs with biofilm were removed from the artificial mouth after being cultured for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 days. the bacteria in the biofilm were analysed by plating on bhis agar and the colony-forming units of each species were counted. results: the total number of bacteria in the chx group was significantly lower than in the other three groups  (including control). there was no decline in the number of bacteria in the listerine group. s. mutans was reduced significantly in the chx group compared with the control group. the number and proportion of a. naeslundii in the chx group were significantly lower than in the other three groups. the proportion of  l. rhamnosus in the chx group was significantly higher than in the other three groups. conclusion: chx has the most significant effect on inhibition of the putative root-caries bacteria, with the exception of l. rhamnosus. both listerine and a combination of fluoride and listerine could not effectively reduce the numbers of bacteria in the biofilm. the effects of chx, listerine and fluoride listerine on root caries prevention need further investigation.

TI  == streptococci-human papilloma virus interaction with ethanol exposure leads to keratinocyte damage.
AB  == purpose: ethanol, human papilloma virus (hpv), and poor oral hygiene are risk factors that have been attributed to oral carcinogenesis. streptococci sp and hpv infections are common in the head and neck, often associated with sexual activity. although hpv is linked to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, it is  unclear whether there is a similar role for streptococci sp. this cell study examines whether streptococci sp and hpv-16 with exposure to ethyl alcohol (etoh) can act as cofactors in the malignant transformation of oral keratinocytes. materials and methods: etoh (0.1%-20% vol/vol) was used to investigate streptococci sp attachment with immortalized e6-expressing hpv/hok-16b cells, human oral buccal keratinocytes, and foreskin keratinocytes. streptococci sp (streptococci mutans [lt11]) and various strains of acetaldehyde (aa) producer and nonproducer streptococcus salivarius (110-1, 109-2, 101-7, and 107-1) and a lactic acid producer bacterium, lactobacillus rhamnosus (24-1 and 25-2), were examined for interactions with keratinocytes by use of a green dye (percent of cells with colonies after 24 hours). carcinogens, aa, malondialdehyde, dna damage, and proliferation (5'-bromo-2-deoxyuridine) among keratinocytes were also quantified. results: aa and malondialdehyde production from permissible streptococci sp significantly increased with attachment to keratinocytes, whereas l rhamnosus did not significantly attach to keratinocytes. this attachment was associated with enhanced levels of aa adduct formation, proliferation (5'-bromo-2-deoxyuridine incorporation), and enhanced migration through integrin-coated basement membrane by hpv oral keratinocytes, which are characteristics of a malignant phenotype. conclusions: these cell studies suggest that oral streptococci sp and hpv (hpv-16) cooperate to transform oral keratinocytes after low-level etoh (1%) exposure. these results appear to suggest a significant clinical interaction, but further validation is warranted.

TI  == effects of compounds found in nidus vespae on the growth and cariogenic virulence factors of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == nidus vespae (honeycomb) is a kind of traditional chinese medicine that has been  demonstrated to inhibit the growth and acid-production of oral cariogenic bacteria. subsequent studies showed that the chloroform/methanol (chl/meoh) chemical extraction of nidus vespae was the most effective inhibitor of growth and acidogenicity of streptococcus mutans. in this study, we isolated the chemical compounds of the nidus vespae chl/meoh extraction, tested their antimicrobial activity against six cariogenic bacteria and further evaluated the  acid inhibition properties, anti-f-atpase activity and anti-ldh activity against  s. mutans. the isolated flavonoids, quercetin and kaempferol, inhibited the growth of bacteria (s. mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii and lactobacillus rhamnosus) with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) ranging from 1 to 4 mg/ml and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) from 4 to 16 mg/ml. in addition, quercetin and kaempferol at sub-mic levels significantly inhibited acidogenicity and acidurity  of s. mutans cells. treated with the test agents, the f-atpase activity was reduced by 47.37% with 1mg/ml quercetin and by 49.66% with 0.5mg/ml kaempferol. the results showed that quercetin and kaempferol contained in chl/meoh extraction presented remarkably biological activity, suggesting that nidus vespae might be useful as a potential preventive and therapeutic agent in dental caries.

AB  == objective: co-aggregation and growth inhibition abilities of probiotic bacteria may play a key role in their interference with the oral biofilm. the aim was to investigate the in vitro ability of selected commercial probiotic lactobacilli to co-aggregate and inhibit growth of oral mutans steptococci isolated from adults with contrasting levels of caries. materials and methods: mutans streptococci (ms) strains were isolated from caries-free (n = 3) and caries-susceptible (n = 5) young adults and processed with eight commercial probiotic lactobacilli strains. one laboratory reference strain (s. mutans ingbritt) was selected as control. co-aggregation was determined spectrophotometrically and growth inhibition was assessed with the agar overlay technique. results: all probiotic lactobacilli showed an ability to co-aggregate with the isolated ms strains. statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were found between strains from  different individuals when compared with the reference strain. the selected lactobacilli inhibited ms growth, but the ability varied between the strains and  was clearly related to ph. no differences were observed between the different ms  strains from caries-free and caries-susceptible individuals. conclusions: the selected lactobacilli displayed co-aggregation activity and inhibited growth of clinical mutans streptococci. the growth inhibition was strain-specific and dependent on ph and cell concentration. the findings indicate that the outcome of lactobacilli-derived probiotic therapy might vary between individuals and depend  on the specific strain used.

TI  == microbiological profiles in saliva and supragingival plaque from caries-active adolescents before and after a short-term daily intake of milk supplemented with  probiotic bacteria - a pilot study.
AB  == purpose: the aim of the present pilot study was to investigate the microbial profile in saliva and supragingival plaque samples collected from caries-active adolescents before and after a daily short-term intake of milk supplemented with  the probiotic bacteria. materials and methods: the present study group consisted  of 18 caries-active adolescents of both sexes who volunteered for participation giving an informed consent. the study has a randomised placebo-controlled double-blind pilot design with two parallel arms. after a 2-week run-in period, the subjects were instructed to drink 2.5 dl of milk supplemented with lactobacillus rhamnosus lb21 (107 cfu/ml) (test) or standard control milk (placebo) once daily for a period of 2 weeks (intervention period). samples of stimulated whole saliva and supragingival plaque were collected at baseline (after run-in) and immediately after the end of the intervention period (follow-up). the salivary levels of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were estimated by conventional culturing on selective agar plates. the presence and level of 19 oral species associated with the caries process were determined using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridisation technique. differences between the groups  were assessed using the non-parametric wilcoxon-mann-whitney and chi-square tests. results: the mean caries experience was high with an average of 7.0 +/- 3.8 proximal enamel lesions. the most prevalent dominating species in the plaque  samples were streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula and streptococcus gordonii. the saliva samples displayed a more mixed profile, with streptococcus mitis, rothia dentocariosa, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus curvata being frequently identified species. all of the subjects harboured mutans streptococci  in their saliva, with 61% of them colonised with salivary lactobacilli. no statistically significant differences in the microbial profiles or the estimated  counts between the baseline and follow-up samples, or between the two study groups, were observed. conclusions: the present study showed that a short-term daily intake of milk supplemented with the probiotic bacterium l. rhamnosus lb21  did not significantly affect the microbial profiles or the levels of caries-associated bacteria in saliva and supragingival plaque samples collected from caries-active adolescents.

TI  == effects of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg on saliva-derived microcosms.
AB  == objective: the probiotic strain lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg) is shown to hamper the presence of mutans streptococci in saliva and may have positive effects on oral health. we investigated the effects of lgg on the cariogenic potential and microbial composition of saliva-derived microcosms. design: single  and dual species biofilms of lgg and streptococcus mutans, and saliva-derived microcosms with or without lgg were grown in an active attachment biofilm model.  the microcosms were grown on bovine dentin/enamel discs in the presence or absence of sucrose (suc+/suc-). the presence of lgg was determined by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (mlpa) and real-time pcr. mutans streptococci (ms) and total viable counts, ph of the spent medium, capacity of lactate formation and integrated mineral loss in dentin was assessed. mlpa was used for identification and relative quantification of 20 oral microorganisms in  the microcosms. principal component analysis was applied to mlpa data. results: lgg inhibited the growth of s. mutans in dual species biofilms and did not affect the ph. lgg established in saliva-derived microcosms and reduced ms counts significantly, but did not affect ph or dentin demineralization. simultaneous growth of the microcosms with lgg under heavy cariogenic conditions (suc+) introduced a compositional shift in the microbial community. the cfu, real-time pcr and mlpa data correlated significantly. conclusion: we conclude that lgg established into and inhibited the growth of ms in complex saliva-derived biofilms, but this had no significant effect on cariogenic potential of the microcosms. this suggests that other microorganisms besides ms were responsible for increased cariogenicity of sucrose-exposed biofilms.

TI  == probiotic lactobacilli interfere with streptococcus mutans biofilm formation in vitro.
AB  == in clinical studies, probiotic bacteria have decreased the counts of salivary mutans streptococci (ms). we compared the effects of probiotic lactobacillus strains on the biofilm formation of streptococcus mutans. the bacterial strains used included four s. mutans strains (reference strains nctc 10449 and ingbritt and clinical isolates 2366 and 195) and probiotic strains lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. plantarum 299v, and l. reuteri strains pta 5289 and sd2112. the ability of ms to adhere and grow on a glass surface, reflecting biofilm formation, was studied in the presence of the lactobacilli (lb). the effect of lb culture supernatants on the viability of the ms was studied as well. all of the lb inhibited the biofilm formation of the clinical isolates of ms (p < 0.001). the biofilm formation of the reference strains of ms was also inhibited by the lb, but l. plantarum and l. reuteri pta 5289 showed a weaker inhibition when compared to l. reuteri sd2112 and l. rhamnosus gg. viable s. mutans cells could be detected in the biofilms and culture media only when the experiments were performed with the l. reuteri strains. the l. reuteri strains were less efficient in killing the ms also in the tests performed with the culture supernatants. the  phs of the supernatants of l. reuteri were higher compared to those of l. rhamnosus gg and l. plantarum; p < 0.001. in conclusion, our results demonstrated that four commonly used probiotics interfered with s. mutans biofilm formation in vitro, and that the antimicrobial activity against s. mutans was ph-dependent.

TI  == growth inhibition of oral mutans streptococci and candida by commercial probiotic lactobacilli--an in vitro study.
AB  == background: probiotic bacteria are suggested to play a role in the maintenance of oral health. such health promoting bacteria are added to different commercial probiotic products. the aim of the study was to investigate the ability of a selection of lactobacilli strains, used in commercially available probiotic products, to inhibit growth of oral mutans streptococci and c. albicans in vitro. methods: eight probiotic lactobacilli strains were tested for growth inhibition on three reference strains and two clinical isolates of mutans streptococci as well as two reference strains and three clinical isolates of candida albicans with an agar overlay method. results: at concentrations ranging from 109 to 105 cfu/ml, all lactobacilli strains inhibited the growth of the mutans streptococci  completely with the exception of l. acidophilus la5 that executed only a slight inhibition of some strains at concentrations corresponding to 107 and 105 cfu/ml. at the lowest cell concentration (103 cfu/ml), only l. plantarum 299v and l. plantarum 931 displayed a total growth inhibition while a slight inhibition was seen for all five mutans streptococci strains by l. rhamnosus lb21, l. paracasei  f19, l. reuteri pta 5289 and l. reuteri atcc 55730. all the tested lactobacilli strains reduced candida growth but the effect was generally weaker than for mutans streptococci. the two l. plantarum strains and l. reuteri atcc 55730 displayed the strongest inhibition on candida albicans. no significant differences were observed between the reference strains and the clinical isolates. conclusion: the selected probiotic strains showed a significant but somewhat varying ability to inhibit growth of oral mutans streptococci and candida albicans in vitro.

TI  == [establishment and evaluation of the in vitro dynamic biofilm model].
AB  == purpose: to establish a dynamic model which could simulate the ecologic environment of oral cavity and study the cariogenicity of oral biofilm, continuously observe the formation of oral biofilm. methods: the fermental vessel and chemostat were designed according to the purpose of the study. four strains of oral bacteria, namely streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, lactobacillus rhamnosus and actinomyces naeslundii, were inoculated in the fermenter. the hydroxyapatite (ha) discs and glass slides were put in the chemostat. the temperature, oxide pressure, ph, dilution rate, circulation rate and substrate of the chemostat were carefully modulated. distilled water and 25mm sucrose solution were used to test the stability of the system. at the beginning  of the model establishment, the anabiosis bacteria were inoculated in fermenter full of fresh artificial saliva with a dilution rate of 10%. after the growth of  bacteria in the fermenter was stable, the four-organism bacterial consortium was  inoculated in the chemotat for 24 hours together with fresh artificial saliva (v/v=1:9). the organisms in planktonic phase were examined everyday. when the populations of consortium got stable(about 72 hours), the test solution was pulsed in the chemostat every 12 hours for 5 days. the ha discs and glass slides  were observed every 24 hours for five times. the data was analyzed using spss 10.0 software package. dunnet t test was used to compare the difference between the two groups at the level of alpha=0.05. results: the dynamic model was successfully established on oral biofilm study. with the pulse of sucrose solution, the environment in the chemostat simulated the cariogenic environment in nature, and all data namely the bacteria population, the biofilm microstructure changed with solution pulse. conclsuions: the model established is proved to be stable and the parameters in the model could be successfully controlled. the model fulfills the dynamic observation of formation of biofilm and caries lesion in vitro.

TI  == specific lactobacillus/mutans streptococcus co-aggregation.
AB  == selective interaction of mutans streptococci with benign bacteria could present an opportunity for their removal from the mouth without disruption of other oral  flora. this study was conducted to find probiotic lactobacilli that could specifically co-aggregate in vitro with mutans streptococci, but not with other plaque commensals. a search of 624 lactobacilli among a large culture library revealed 6 strains, all classifiable as l. paracasei or l. rhamnosus, which met this criterion. such novel, specific co-aggregation, however, was not a general characteristic of these species or the genus lactobacillus. the co-aggregation by these specific lactobacilli was characterized as heat treatment (autoclaving)- and protease-resistant, lectin-independent, not inactivated by sugar substitutes, operational over a wide ph range, unaffected by whole saliva, but calcium-dependent. it is thus seen to present a potential strategy for in vivo alteration of plaque biofilm and caries.

TI  == coaggregation between probiotic bacteria and caries-associated strains: an in vitro study.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the in vitro abilities of probiotic bacteria derived from  consumer products to coaggregate with caries-associated mutans streptococci. material and methods: six lactobacillus strains (l. acidophilus (ccug 5917), l. plantarum 299v, l. rhamnosus gg and lb21, l. paracasei f19, l. reuteri pta5289) were cultivated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees c in man rogosa sharpe (msb) broth for 24 h. four strains of human streptococci (s. mutans ingbritt, s.  mutans (atcc 25175), s. mutans gs-5, s. sobrinus (atcc 33478) were similarly grown in brain heart infusion (bhi) broth. a gastrointestinal pathogen (escherichia coli) was aerobically cultivated on bhi broth as a positive control. after incubation, the bacteria were aerobically harvested, washed, and suspended  in 10 mmol/l phosphate-buffered saline (ph 7.2). the probiotic strains were characterized with the api 50 ch system to confirm their identity. coaggregation  was determined by spectrophotometry in mixtures and bacterial suspensions alone after 1, 2, 4, and 24 h and expressed as the aggregation ratio (%). results: all  probiotic strains showed coaggregation abilities with the oral pathogens and the  results were strain specific and dependent on time. s. mutans gs-5 exhibited a significantly higher ability to coaggregate with all the probiotic strains than the other mutans streptococci and e. coli. the differences among the probiotic strains were modest with l. acidophilus being the most prone and l. rhamnosus lb21 the least prone to coaggregate with the oral streptococci. conclusions: the  results demonstrated different abilities of lactobacilli-derived probiotic bacteria to coaggregate with selected oral streptococci. aggregation assays may be a useful complement for screening of probiotic candidates with possible anti-caries properties.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of yoghurt starter lactobacilli and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg adhesion to saliva-coated surfaces.
AB  == aim: the aim of the study was to evaluate the adhesion of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg to saliva-coated surfaces in vitro. methods: fifteen radiolabeled dairy l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strains and l. rhamnosus gg were tested for their ability to adhere to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads and polystyrene microtiter plates and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counter. the effects of lysozyme on the adhesion of lactobacilli and of pretreatment with lactobacilli on the adhesion of streptococcus sanguinis were also assessed. results: all strains tested adhered to saliva-coated surfaces but  with significantly different binding frequencies. the adhesion of the l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strains remained lower in comparison to l. rhamnosus strain gg. one l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strain showed binding frequency comparable to s. sanguinis. lysozyme pretreatment of the samples significantly increased lactobacillus adhesion to saliva-coated surfaces. conclusion: the present results showed significant variations in the adhesion capacity of the lactobacillus strains studied. adhesion to oral surfaces is of primary importance for bacterial colonization in the mouth. only one of the l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus dairy starter culture strains investigated had a high adhesion percentage. this strain might then be considered for further investigations in the oral environment.

TI  == final ph affects the interference capacity of naturally occurring oral lactobacillus strains against mutans streptococci.
AB  == objectives: to establish the effects of three factors: previous caries experience; colonization of streptococcus mutans; and final ph on autologous lactobacilli-mediated inhibition against a panel of mutans streptococci in young  subjects with different caries experiences. design: the inhibition capacity was determined by the use of the agar overlay method and the final ph in culture medium was measured after 20 h. using a logistic regression model, the risk of having an incomplete lactobacilli-mediated inhibition was calculated. results: all three factors significantly influenced the interference outcome in the order; final ph of the lactobacillus strains, oral colonization of autologous s. mutans  and caries experience. a high risk occurred at a lower ph and at a wider ph range for individuals with previous caries experience and autologous colonization of s. mutans compared with caries-free subjects who were not colonized. at a final ph of 4.0, this risk was approximately eight times higher than that of the latter group. two mutans streptococcus strains in the test panel demonstrated high individual predictive values of inhibition mediated by oral lactobacilli. conclusions: generation of a low ph either directly via organic acid production and/or production of bacteriocins or metabolites at a low ph may promote mutans streptococcus growth inhibition, in vitro. furthermore, a shift of ph range for the risk of incomplete inhibition of mutans streptococci suggests a less effective inhibition at a wider ph range for naturally occurring lactobacilli from individuals with earlier caries experience containing own s. mutans.

TI  == effect of xylitol on an in vitro model of oral biofilm.
AB  == purpose: the aim of the present study was to examine whether xylitol, at different concentrations, inhibits the formation of an experimental model of oral biofilm. materials and methods: biofilms of six bacterial species (streptococcus  mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, actinomyces viscosus, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum) were prepared on hydroxyapatite (ha) discs according to the zurich biofilm model. xylitol was tested at two concentrations, 1% and 3%. at the end of their designated incubation times, some ha discs were destined for confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and the others were harvested using a sterile surgical instrument. aliquots of harvested biofilms were diluted and plated onto specific  media. after a 48-h anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees c, the colony-forming units (cfus) were counted. results: clsm images showed that only a small amount of isolated bacteria was observed on the surface of ha discs. culture of harvested biofilms showed an inhibition in the growth of different species included in the biofilms. conclusions: xylitol has a clear inhibitory effect on the formation of the experimental biofilms. this study shows that xylitol is not  only efficient in inhibiting the acid production of cariogenic bacteria, but also in preventing the formation of a multispecies biofilm; it confirms the relevance  of the use of this polyol for the prevention of oral diseases caused by dental plaque.

TI  == anticaries effect of compounds extracted from galla chinensis in a multispecies biofilm model.
AB  == introduction: galla chinensis is a leaf gall known to have some antibacterial effects. using an in vitro biofilm model of dental plaque, the present study aimed to evaluate the anticaries effects of galla chinensis and its chemical fractions. methods: a four-organism bacterial consortium (streptococcus sanguis,  streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus rhamnosus) was grown  on hydroxyapatite (ha) discs, bovine enamel blocks, and glass surfaces in a continuous culture system and exposed to repeated solution pulses. galla chinensis extracts, sucrose solutions, and sodium fluoride solutions were pulsed  into different flow cells. the ph value of the planktonic phase in each flow cell was recorded and the bacteria colonizing the biofilm on the ha discs were counted. enamel blocks were observed using a polarized microscope and lesion depth was evaluated. the biofilm morphology was examined with a fluorescence microscope and the images captured were analyzed on an image analysis system. results: when galla chinensis extract, its chemical fraction, or fluoride was added to the sucrose solution, the planktonic phase ph remained higher than that  in the sucrose alone. a lower level of colonization on the ha surface was also observed in the groups to which galla chinensis and fluoride were added compared  with the control sucrose group, and this was reflected in both the total viable count and the biofilm imaging, which showed fewer cariogenic bacteria and a less  compact biofilm, respectively. enamel demineralization in both the fluoride group and the galla chinensis group was significantly less than that in the sucrose group. conclusions: galla chinensis and fluoride may inhibit the cariogenicity of the oral biofilm. galla chinensis appears to be a promising source of new agents  that may prevent dental caries.

TI  == probiotic bacteria affect the composition of salivary pellicle and streptococcal  adhesion in vitro.
AB  == introduction: the use of probiotic bacteria is increasing worldwide and at least  some of them can transiently colonize the oral cavity. several studies have shown that probiotic bacteria, which are often thought of in relation only to intestinal health, can also affect the oral ecology, but the mechanisms for this  are largely unknown. the aim of this study was to investigate in vitro if the probiotic bacteria used in commercial products affect the protein composition of  the salivary pellicle and the adherence of other oral bacteria. methods: salivary pellicle on hydroxyapatite and the adhesion of two oral streptococci, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus gordonii, were used as a model. results: probiotic bacteria that bound to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite reduced the adhesion of s. mutans but the inhibitory effect on the adherence of s. gordonii was weaker. salivary pellicle protein composition was modified by all the strains tested. the modifications in the pellicle affected the adherence of s. mutans but not of s. gordonii. two of the proteins missing from the pellicles made of saliva-treated with the probiotic bacteria were identified as salivary agglutinin gp340 and salivary peroxidase. all bacterial strains bound salivary agglutinin gp340. the ability of the probiotic bacteria to degrade peroxidase was demonstrated with purified bovine lactoperoxidase and two of the probiotic strains. conclusion: this in vitro study showed that probiotic strains used in commercial products may affect the oral ecology by specifically preventing the adherence of other bacteria and by modifying the protein composition of the salivary pellicle.

TI  == characterization of oral lactobacilli as potential probiotics for oral health.
AB  == introduction: intestinal lactobacilli have been successfully used as probiotics to treat gastrointestinal disorders, but only limited data are available for the  probiotic properties of oral lactobacilli to combat oral diseases. we aimed to characterize oral lactobacilli for their potential probiotic properties according to the international guidelines for the evaluation of probiotics, and to select potential probiotic strains for oral health. methods: the study included 67 salivary and subgingival lactobacilli of 10 species, isolated from healthy humans. all strains were identified using amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis, tested for antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens, tolerance of  low ph and bile content. thereafter, the lysozyme tolerance and antibiotic susceptibility of 22 potential probiotic strains were assessed. results: the majority of strains suppressed the growth of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and streptococcus mutans, but none inhibited candida albicans. the lowest ph tolerated by lactobacilli following 4 h of incubation was ph 2.5, but none of the strains grew at this ph. all strains tolerated a high concentration of lysozyme (10 mg/ml) and half of the strains tolerated a high concentration of human bile [5% volume/volume (v/v)]. four lactobacillus plantarum and two lactobacillus oris strains expressed resistance to tetracycline and/or doxycycline. conclusions: strains of l. plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus rhamnosus expressed both high antimicrobial activity and high tolerance of environmental stress. the absence of transferable antibiotic-resistance genes in l. plantarum strains remains to be confirmed. these results suggest a potential for oral lactobacilli to be used as probiotics  for oral health.

TI  == lactobacillus-mediated interference of mutans streptococci in caries-free vs. caries-active subjects.
AB  == in order to assess whether naturally occurring oral lactobacilli have probiotic properties, lactobacilli were isolated from saliva and plaque from children and adolescents, with or without caries lesions. the interference capacities of these lactobacilli were investigated against a panel of 13 clinical isolates and reference strains of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, as well as  against the subject's autologous mutans streptococci, using the agar-overlay technique. lactobacillus-mediated inhibition differed significantly between the three subject groups (no caries, arrested caries, or active caries), demonstrating increased inhibition in subjects without present or previous caries experience compared to subjects with arrested caries or subjects presenting with  frank lesions. lactobacilli from subjects lacking s. mutans inhibited the growth  of the test panel of mutans streptococci significantly better than lactobacilli from subjects who were colonized. furthermore, subjects without caries experience harbored lactobacilli that more effectively repressed the growth of their autologous mutans streptococci. twenty-three lactobacillus spp. completely inhibited the growth of all mutans streptococci tested. species with maximum interference capacity against mutans streptococci included lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus rhamnosus. naturally occurring oral lactobacilli significantly inhibited the growth of both test strains of mutans streptococci and the subject's autologous mutans streptococci in vitro, and this effect was more pronounced in caries-free subjects.

AB  == the in vitro digestion of caprine whey proteins was investigated by a two-step degradation assay, using human gastric juice (hgj) at ph 2.5 and human duodenal juice (hdj) at ph 7.5. different protein and peptide profiles were observed after the first (hgj) and second (hdj) enzymatic degradation. the minor whey proteins serum albumin, lactoferrin and ig were rapidly degraded by hgj, while alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-la) and beta-lactoglobulin (beta-lg) were more resistant and survived both 30 and 45 min of the enzymatic treatment. further digestion with hdj still showed intact beta-lg, and the main part of alpha-la also remained unchanged. the protein degradation by hgj and hdj was also compared with treatment by commercial enzymes, by using pepsin at ph 2.5, and a mixture of trypsin and chymotrypsin at ph 7.5. the two methods resulted in different caprine protein and peptide profiles. the digests after treatment with hgj and hdj were screened for antibacterial effects on some selected microorganisms, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and streptococcus mutans. active growing cells of e. coli were inhibited by the digestion products from caprine whey obtained after treatment with hgj and hdj. cells of b. cereus were inhibited only by whey proteins obtained after reaction with hgj, while the products after further degradation with hdj demonstrated no significant effect. screenings performed on cells of lb. rhamnosus gg and s. mutans all showed no signs of inhibition.

TI  == the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence.
AB  == some novel caries detection and excavation devices rely on the ability of bacteria to produce red fluorescing compounds. the aim of this study was to examine the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence. streptococcus mutans, s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus fermentans, l. casei, l. rhamnosus, actinomyces naeslundi, a. israelii, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum were inoculated onto columbia  agar with haemin and vitamin k and incubated anaerobically for up to 7 days in the dark. the resulting bacterial colonies were excited using filtered xenon light (405 +/- 20 nm) and digitally photographed through a 530-nm high-pass filter. the red and green portions of the colony fluorescence were analyzed using a computer program and the red/green ratio was calculated. all colonies emitted both red and green fluorescence. the green outweighed the red portion for the following species (in descending order) s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. mutans, f. nucleatum and s. sobrinus. the red portion was higher for the following species (in descending order) p. intermedia, a. naeslundi, a. israelii, l. fermentans, l. rhamnosus and l. casei. with all the bacteria examined, one color portion generally outweighed the other, giving the visual impression of either red or green fluorescence. we conclude that red fluorescence is well suited to detection of the bacteria which cause dentin caries but it is not suitable as an indicator  of the presence and activity of the streptococci involved in initial caries.

AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

TI  == [the effect of galla chinensis on the growth of cariogenic bacteria in vitro].
AB  == objective: the purples of this study was to investigate the role of different components of galla chinensis extract on the growth of 6 kinds of cariogenic bacteria, and to find out the most effective components of galla chinensis extract. methods: four different components (gce1, gce2, gce3 and gce4) were separated from galla chinensis and there antibacterial activities to streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556, streptococcus  salivarius ss 196, actinomyces naeslundii wvu 627, actinomyces viscosus atcc 19246 and lactobacillus rhamnosus ac 413 were checked. there effects on the growth curve of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 were also investigated. results:  the most effective part of galla chinensis was found to be gce2 and gce4, which were found to be a mixture of polyphenol-rich fractions. all of the different components had an inhibitory effect to the growth of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175. conclusion: all of the 4 different components of galla chinensis extract could inhibit the growth of the tested bacteria. these results suggest that the antibacterial activity of galla chinensis extract is caused by a synergistic effect of monomeric polyphenols, which can easily bind to proteins.

TI  == biofilm growth of lactobacillus species is promoted by actinomyces species and streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the ability of oral bacteria to integrate within a biofilm is pivotal to their survival. a dependence on the amount of biofilm growth by noncoaggregating lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus plantarum on coculture with actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces gerencseriae, streptococcus mutans and veillonella parvula was investigated using an artificial-mouth culture system. biofilm formation by the lactobacilli in mono-culture was poor. in coculture with actinomyces species the amount of l. rhamnosus increased 7-20 times and l. plantarum 4-7 times compared to its mono-culture biofilm. s. mutans also promoted substantial biofilm growth of lactobacilli but v. parvula had no effect. we conclude that these actinomyces species promoted growth of key lactobacillus species in a biofilm, as did s. mutans to a smaller extent, and that the ability  of individual bacteria to form mono-culture biofilms is not necessarily an indicator of their survival and pathogenic potential in a complex multispecies biofilm community.

TI  == suppression of caries-related microorganisms in dentine lesions after short-term  chlorhexidine or antibiotic treatment.
AB  == this study investigated the efficiency of a chlorhexidine varnish and an antibiotic paste in suppressing the cultivable microflora of deep dentine cavities in a stepwise excavation procedure. subsequent to enamel preparation and removal of the central biomass, infected dentine was sampled from the cavity floor. ten cavities each were either covered with the 1% chlorhexidine- and 1% thymol-containing varnish cervitec (ce), the demeclocycline hydrocortisone-containing ointment ledermix (le) or received no treatment as control (co). a compomer composite was used as intermediate restorative. cavities were reassessed after 6 weeks and again dentine samples were microbiologically investigated for total viable counts, mutans streptococci and lactobacilli. after 6 weeks a significant reduction of the total viable counts was observed in the le group (p = 0.011) compared to the control, whereas no differences were found in the ce group (p > 0.05). mutans streptococci were rarely recovered at baseline and after 6 weeks. compared to the co group counts of lactobacilli were significantly reduced in the ce and le groups (p < 0.05). lactobacillus species were frequently recovered at baseline and after 6 weeks of observation. lactobacillus rhamnosus was the predominant species in all samples investigated.  application of ce or le resulted in reduced counts of lactobacilli after a period of 6 weeks. although none of the materials completely eliminated the viable microorganisms, the use of le was more effective than ce in reducing the total anaerobic microorganisms associated with carious dentine.

TI  == molecular analysis of the microflora associated with dental caries.
AB  == molecular techniques have revealed many novel, presumed unculturable, taxa in oral infections. the aim of this study was to characterize the bacterial community of the middle and advancing front of carious dental lesions by cultural and molecular analyses. samples were collected with a hand excavator from five teeth with carious lesions involving dentine. samples were cultured on blood agar and rogosa agar incubated in air plus 5% co(2) and on fastidious anaerobe agar anaerobically. dna was also extracted directly from the samples and 16s rrna genes were amplified by pcr with universal primers. pcr products were singularized by cloning, and the cloned inserts and cultured isolates were identified by 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. we identified 95 taxa among the 496 isolates and 1,577 clones sequenced; 44 taxa were detected by the molecular method alone; 31 taxa were previously undescribed. only three taxa, streptococcus mutans, rothia dentocariosa, and an unnamed propionibacterium sp., were found in  all five samples. the predominant taxa by anaerobic cultivation were the novel propionibacterium sp. (18%), olsenella profusa (14%), and lactobacillus rhamnosus (8%). the predominant taxa in the molecular analysis were streptococcus mutans (16%), lactobacillus gasseri/johnsonii (13%), and lactobacillus rhamnosus (8%). there was no significant difference between the compositions of the microflora in the middle and advancing front samples (p < 0.05, wilcoxon matched pairs, signed  ranks test). in conclusion, combined cultural and molecular analyses have shown that a diverse bacterial community is found in dentinal caries and that numerous  novel taxa are present.

TI  == selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. methods: a gradient plate technique was used to expose fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, neisseria subflava, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii,  prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations  of triclosan. escherichia coli atcc 8739 was included as an organism showing the  triclosan resistance development trait. mic values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. results: n. subflava, pr. nigrescens po. gingivalis and e. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (mic range 0.1-3.9 mg/l), whereas the lactobacillus and  s. mutans were less susceptible (mic range 15.6-20.8 mg/l). triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (p < 0.01) for the positive control e. coli, although its mics towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (mic) occurred for pr. nigrescens and in s. sanguis and s. oralis (mbc). mean changes in susceptibilities (mic and mbc) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine mbcs for s. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. conclusions: these data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for e. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than fabi that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.

TI  == susceptibility of oral bacteria to melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil in vitro.
AB  == the in vitro activity of melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil against 161 isolates of oral bacteria from 15 genera was determined. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) ranged from 0.003 to 2.0% (v/v). mic90 values were 1.0% (v/v) for actinomyces spp., lactobacillus spp., streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis, and 0.1% (v/v) for prevotella spp. isolates of porphyromonas, prevotella and veillonella had the lowest mics and mbcs, and isolates of streptococcus, fusobacterium and lactobacillus had the highest. time kill studies with streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus rhamnosus showed that treatment with > or = 0.5% tea tree oil caused decreases in viability of >3 log colony forming units/ml after only 30 s,  and viable organisms were not detected after 5 min. these studies indicate that a range of oral bacteria are susceptible to tea tree oil, suggesting that tea tree  oil may be of use in oral healthcare products and in the maintenance of oral hygiene.

TI  == short-term consumption of probiotic-containing cheese and its effect on dental caries risk factors.
AB  == cheese is known to contain compounds that reduce the risk of dental caries. the long-term consumption of milk containing lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, atcc 53103 (lgg), has been shown to reduce caries risk in children. the aim of the present study was to examine whether short-term consumption of cheese containing lgg and  lactobacillus rhamnosus lc 705 would diminish caries-associated salivary microbial counts in young adults. altogether, 74 18-35 year-old subjects completed this double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled study. during the 3 week intervention, the subjects ate 5 x 15 g cheese per day. oral examinations were made before and after the study. stimulated salivary secretion rates, buffer capacity and counts of salivary streptococcus mutans, yeast and lactobacilli were evaluated before and after the intervention and after a 3 week post-treatment period. the results showed no statistically significant difference between the groups in streptococcus mutans counts after the intervention, but during the post-treatment period there was a significantly greater reduction in these counts in the intervention group compared to the control group (p=0.05). however, streptococcus mutans counts decreased in 20% (p=0.01) and yeast counts in 27% (p=0.005) of all the subjects, regardless of the intervention group. results from logistic regression showed a trend indicating that probiotic intervention might reduce the risk of the highest level of streptococcus mutans (or=0.37, 95% ci 0.08-1.75, p=0.21) and salivary yeasts (or=0.40, 0.09-1.71, p=0.22).

TI  == stability and activity of specific antibodies against streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus in bovine milk fermented with lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg or treated at ultra-high temperature.
AB  == passive local immunization against dental caries is a promising approach to its prevention, as clinical evidence of active oral or nasal immunization is still limited and controversial. by means of systemic immunization of pregnant cows with a multivalent vaccine, high titres of igg antibodies against human cariogenic bacteria, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, were produced in bovine colostrum. the purified immune product (ip) of this preparation has a number of anticariogenic properties, such as inhibition of streptococcal adherence to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite and inhibition of glucosyltransferase enzymes. this study investigated whether ip antibodies remained active and functional when added to ultra-high temperature (uht)-treated milk or to lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg)-fermented milk stored for an extended time. lgg was chosen because of its widely known health benefits in humans and animals. a commercial uht toddler's milk was supplemented with ip and stored for  2 months at 5, 21 and 30 degrees c. the antistreptococcal titres in uht milk did  not decline at any temperature during storage, and uht-ip inhibited the adherence of s. mutans for up to 2 months. this was not the case with uht toddler's milk without igg antibodies. milk was fermented with live lgg cells in the presence or absence of 5% ip. the antistreptococcal titres declined to about 30% of the original titres after storage. fresh milk alone slightly enhanced streptococcal adhesion but fresh milk with ip inhibited the adherence of s. mutans by over 50%. lgg-positive fermented milk without antibodies also inhibited (p < 0.05) the adhesion by about 40%. in both lgg-fermented and uht immune milk, the activity of antibodies against cariogenic streptococci was maintained during the expected shelf-life of these products. from the anticariogenic point of view it may be beneficial to add bovine-specific antibodies against mutans streptococci to probiotic lgg-containing milk products.

TI  == effect of long-term consumption of a probiotic bacterium, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, in milk on dental caries and caries risk in children.
AB  == lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, atcc (lgg), has shown antagonism to many bacteria including mutans streptococci. this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled  intervention study was designed to examine whether milk containing lgg has an effect on caries and the risk of caries in children when compared with normal milk. 594 children, 1-6 years old, from 18 municipal day-care centres were included. the children received the milk with meals from coded containers 5 days  a week in the day-care centres for 7 months. the children's oral health was recorded at baseline and at the end, using who criteria. the caries risk was calculated based on clinical and microbiological data, comprising mutans streptococcus levels from dental plaque and saliva. the risk was classified as high if the child had a dmft/dmft or initial caries score >0, and a mutans streptococcus count > or = 10(5) cfu/ml. the results showed less dental caries in the lgg group and lower mutans streptococcus counts at the end of the study. lgg  was found to reduce the risk of caries significantly (or = 0.56, p = 0.01; controlled for age and gender, or = 0.51, p = 0.004). the effect was particularly clear in the 3- to 4-year-olds. thus, milk containing the probiotic lgg bacteria  may have beneficial effects on children's dental health.

TI  == the predominant microflora of nursing caries lesions.
AB  == the predominant microflora recovered from infected dentine of 52 carious teeth from 14 children with nursing caries was determined using both selective and non-selective media for the isolation of specific genera and acidified media (ph  5.2) to isolate the predominant aciduric microorganisms, and compared with the microflora of sound enamel surfaces in caries-free children. streptococcus mutans formed a significantly greater proportion of the lesion flora while streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus gordonii formed a significantly greater proportion of the plaque flora from sound tooth surfaces. the proportions of actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces odontolyticus were significantly greater in the plaque samples than in the lesion samples. actinomyces israelii formed 18.2% of the flora from the lesions, but was not isolated from the plaque  samples. the proportions of candida albicans, lactobacillus spp. and veillonella  spp. were also significantly greater in the carious dentine than in the plaque samples. the most frequently isolated lactobacilli were lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the predominant aciduric flora was s. oralis, s. mutans and a. israelii and these taxa were also isolated  from a similar proportion of the lesions at ph 7.0. strains of s. mutans, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. rhamnosus isolated from individual carious teeth were  genotyped using pcr-based methods. each species was genotypically heterogeneous and different genotypes were recovered from different carious teeth in the same child. these data indicate that the microflora of lesions in the same child is microbiologically diverse and support a non-specific aetiology for nursing caries in which the physiological characteristics of the infecting flora, not its composition, is the major determinant underlying the disease process.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria from healthy oral cavity of thai volunteers: inhibition of oral pathogens.
AB  == the aims of the present study were to screen and characterize the antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria which were isolated from healthy oral cavities of thai volunteers, and to characterize their inhibiting substances. among 3790 isolates  (suspected to be lactic acid bacteria) from 130 volunteers, five showed an appreciable effect against sarcina lutea atcc 9341, bacillus cereus atcc 11778, escherichia coli atcc 25922, staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, streptococcus mutans dtmu 1, strep. salivarius dtmu 1, strep. sanguis dtmu 1, candida albicans  atcc 13803 and c. albicans dtmu 2, as well as the oral pathogens. these antimicrobial isolates included l17 and n14 which showed the antibacterial activity, d14 which showed the anticandidal activity, and d6 and n8 which showed  both the antibacterial and anticandidal activities. the isolates were later found to be facultative anaerobic, gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-capsule-forming and catalase-negative bacilli. they could utilize casein but  could not hydrolyse starch, and they produced hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins. their antimicrobial potentials were found to be affected by ph, catalase, proteolytic enzymes and temperature. the activity was partially inactivated after catalase treatment, significantly declined at ph > or =9.0 or after trypsin and pepsin treatments, and also reduced after heating at > or =100 degrees c. however, the antimicrobial activity of these five isolates was somewhat resistant to heat. when the isolates were tested for their antimicrobial sensitivity, they  were shown to be sensitive to a number of antimicrobial agents. the final identification revealed that d6, d14 and n14 were lactobacillus paracasei subsp.  paracasei, and l17 and n8 were lact. rhamnosus.

TI  == development of multi-species consortia biofilms of oral bacteria as an enamel and root caries model system.
AB  == the aim was to establish defined-species consortium plaque biofilms to investigate enamel and root caries in an artificial mouth. strains of the putative enamel and root caries pathogens, streptococcus mutans, strep. sobrinus, actinomyces naeslundii and lactobacillus rhamnosus, were screened in batch culture for potential cariogenic properties: a low terminal ph, ability to aggregate, and catabolic diversity. the strains selected were grown as monoculture biofilms and as consortium plaque biofilms in a multiplaque artificial mouth. the biofilms were supplied with a constant flow of a simulated  oral fluid and were given periodic sucrose (and in some instances glucose) to simulate meals. all the bacteria except l. rhamnosus formed large, monospecies biofilms with resting ph in the range 5.3-5.8. the consortia biofilms were larger and had a resting ph of 4.9-5.3. the consortia biofilms supplied with 8-hourly carbohydrate comprised mainly 'mutans' streptococci (58, sd 5.5%) and l. rhamnosus (42, sd 5.7%). a. naeslundii characteristically was absent or present in a low percentage (up to 4% colony-forming units). all biofilms demineralized polished bovine enamel and dentine blocks, as assessed by microradiography and enamel-surface microhardness measurement. the consortia also demineralized intact enamel and tooth roots; they were more cariogenic to enamel than any of the monoculture biofilms, as measured by enamel-surface softening, but variation in lesion depth was proportional to biofilm wet weight irrespective of acidogen composition (r = 0.93, p < 0.05). enamel lesions had a well-mineralized intact surface and a zone of subsurface demineralization, typical of early natural lesions. dentine and root lesions showed extensive demineralization but lacked a  pronounced surface mineralized zone. substitution of glucose for sucrose had no effect on the cariogenicity of the consortium to bovine enamel or human roots and had no major effect on the plaque composition. continuously supplied fluoride (19 parts/10(6)) resulted in a substantially reduced enamel surface softening and subsurface demineralization of intact roots. it was concluded that consortia biofilms of selected caries pathogens generate realistic caries lesions in all tooth hard tissues under controlled growth conditions in the artificial mouth. this in vitro caries experimental model may prove useful for the study of interrelations between the plaque biofilm, tooth tissues and the oral environment, and for the development of procedures to modify the course of caries development.

TI  == regulated expression of the streptococcus mutans dlt genes correlates with intracellular polysaccharide accumulation.
AB  == intracellular polysaccharides (ips) are glycogen-like storage polymers which contribute significantly to streptococcus mutans-induced cariogenesis. we previously identified and cloned a locus from the s. mutans chromosome which is required for the accumulation of ips. sequencing of this locus revealed at least  four contiguous open reading frames, all of which are preceded by a common promoter region and are transcribed in the same direction. analysis of the amino  acid sequence deduced from the first of these open reading frames (orf1) revealed domains which are highly conserved among d-alanine-activating enzymes (dlta) in lactobacillus rhamnosus (formerly lactobacillus casei) and bacillus subtilis. the deduced amino acid sequences derived from orf2, -3, and -4 also exhibit extensive similarity to dltb, -c, and -d, respectively, in these microorganisms. however, southern hybridization experiments indicate that this operon maps to a locus on the s. mutans chromosome which is separate from the glgp, glga, and glgd genes, whose products are known mediators of bacterial ips accumulation. we therefore assigned a new dlt designation to the locus which we had formerly called glg. we  maintain that the dlt genes are involved in s. mutans ips accumulation, however,  since they complement a mutation in trans which otherwise renders s. mutans ips deficient. in this study, we found that expression of the s. mutans dlt genes is  growth phase dependent and is modulated by carbohydrates internalized via the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (pts). we demonstrated that the s.  mutans dlt genes are expressed constitutively when non-pts sugars are provided as the sole source of carbohydrate. consistent with a role for the pts in dlt expression is a similar constitutive expression of the dlt genes in an s. mutans  pts mutant grown in a chemically defined medium supplemented with glucose. in summary, these findings support a novel role for the dlt gene products in s. mutans ips accumulation and suggest that dlt expression in this oral pathogen is  subject to complex mechanisms of control imposed by growth phase, dietary carbohydrate, and other factors present in the plaque environment.

TI  == analysis of ph-driven disruption of oral microbial communities in vitro.
AB  == previously, a mixed culture chemostat system was used to demonstrate that the ph  generated from carbohydrate metabolism, rather than carbohydrate availability per se, was responsible for the shifts observed in the oral microflora which are associated with high carbohydrate diets and the development of dental caries. the aim of this study was to determine more accurately the microbially generated ph at which such shifts occurred. nine oral bacteria were grown in three independent chemostats, and pulsed with glucose on 10 consecutive days. in one chemostat, ph  control was discontinued for 6 h, and the ph fall was restricted to a minimum value of ph 5.5; the ph fall was arrested in the other two chemostats at either ph 5. 0, or at ph 4.5. when the ph was allowed to fall, the numbers and proportions of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus rhamnosus increased; this increase was directly related to the magnitude of the ph fall. veillonella dispar was the most numerous organism following all glucose pulsing regimes, especially  at low ph. the increase in proportions of acidogenic bacteria was accompanied by  a fall in the proportions of acid-sensitive species (fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus oralis). the counts of these species were relatively stable between ph 5.5 and 4.5, but were markedly reduced when the ph fell below ph 4.5; neisseria subflava could not persist in the culture at ph 4.5 or below. the data suggest that the disruption of communities associated with glucose metabolism and low ph can be explained in  terms of a two-stage process. a fall in ph to a value between ph 5.5 and 4.5 may  allow the enrichment of potentially cariogenic species, whilst permitting species associated with health to remain relatively unaffected. a further reduction in ph (<ph 4.5) may not only enhance the competitiveness of odontopathogens, but inhibit the growth and metabolism of non-caries-associated species. the results also indicate that species other that mutans streptococci or lactobacilli are competitive at ph values low enough to demineralise enamel, and thus suggest that a broader range of micro-organisms may be associated with caries initiation.

TI  == inhibition of purified enolases from oral bacteria by fluoride.
AB  == enolase activity in strains of oral streptococci previously has been found to be  inhibited by 50% (ki) by fluoride concentrations ranging from 50 to 300 microm or more in the presence of 0.5 to 1.0 mm inorganic phosphate ions. in this study, enolase was extracted and partly purified by a two-step process from five oral bacterial species and the effect of fluoride on the kinetics of enolase examined. the molecular weight of the putative enolase proteins was 46-48 kda. the vmax values ranged from 20 to 323 iu/mg and k(m) for glycerate-2-phosphate from 0.22 to 0.74 mm. enolase activity was inhibited competitively by fluoride, with ki values ranging from 16 to 54 microm in the presence of 5 mm inorganic phosphate ions. ki values for phosphate ranged from 2 to 8 mm. the enolase from streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556 was more sensitive to fluoride (ki = 16 +/- 2) than was enolase from streptococcus salivarius atcc 10575 (ki = 19 +/- 2) or streptococcus mutans nctc 10449 (ki = 40 +/- 4) and all three streptococcal strains were more sensitive to fluoride than either actinomyces naeslundii wvu 627 (ki = 46 +/- 6) or lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 7469 (ki = 54 +/- 6) enolases. the levels of fluoride found to inhibit the streptococcal enolases in this study are much lower than previously reported and are likely to be present in plaque, especially during acidogenesis, and could exert an anti-glycolytic effect.
