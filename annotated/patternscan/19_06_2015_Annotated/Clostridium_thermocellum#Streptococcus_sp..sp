TI  == a new type of cohesin domain that specifically binds the dockerin domain of the clostridium thermocellum cellulosome-integrating protein cipa.
AB  == the cellulosome-integrating protein cipa, which serves as a scaffolding protein for the cellulolytic complex produced by clostridium thermocellum, comprises a cooh-terminal duplicated segment termed the dockerin domain. this paper reports the cloning and sequencing of a gene, termed sdba (for scaffoldin dockerin binding), encoding a protein which specifically binds the dockerin domain of cipa. the sequenced fragment comprises an open reading frame of 1,893 nucleotides encoding a 631-amino-acid polypeptide, termed sdba, with a calculated molecular mass of 68,577 kda. saa comprises an nh2-terminal leader peptide followed by three distinct regions. the nh2-terminal region is similar to the nh2-terminal repeats of c. thermocellum olpb and orf2p. the central region is rich in lysine and harbors a motif present in streptococcus m proteins. the cooh-terminal region consists of a triplicated sequence present in several bacterial cell surface proteins. the nh2-terminal region of sdba and a fusion protein carrying the first nh2-terminal repeat of olpb were shown to bind the dockerin domain of cipa. thus, a new type of cohesin domain, which is present in one, two, and four copies in sdba, orf2p, and olpb, respectively, can be defined. since olpb and most likely sdba and orf2p are located in the cell envelope, the three proteins probably participate in anchoring cipa (and the cellulosome) to the cell surface.
