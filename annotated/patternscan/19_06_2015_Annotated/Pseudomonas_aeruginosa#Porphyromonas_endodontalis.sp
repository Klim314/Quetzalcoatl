TI  == subgingival microbial communities in leukocyte adhesion deficiency and their relationship with local immunopathology.
AB  == leukocyte adhesion deficiency i (lad-i) is a primary immunodeficiency caused by single gene mutations in the cd18 subunit of beta2 integrins which result in defective transmigration of neutrophils into the tissues. affected patients suffer from recurrent life threatening infections and severe oral disease (periodontitis). microbial communities in the local environment (subgingival plaque) are thought to be the triggers for inflammatory periodontitis, yet little is known regarding the microbial communities associated with lad-i periodontitis. here we present the first comprehensive characterization of the subgingival communities in lad-i, using a 16s rrna gene-based microarray, and investigate the relationship of this tooth adherent microbiome to the local immunopathology of periodontitis. we show that the lad subgingival microbiome is distinct from that  of health and localized aggressive periodontitits. select periodontitis-associated species in the lad microbiome included parvimonas micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, eubacterium brachy and treponema species. pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium not typically found in subgingival plaque is detected in  lad-i. we suggest that microbial products from lad-associated communities may have a role in stimulating the local inflammatory response. we demonstrate that bacterial lps translocates into the lesions of lad-periodontitis potentially triggering immunopathology. we also show in in vitro assays with human macrophages and in vivo in animal models that microbial products from lad-associated subgingival plaque trigger il-23-related immune responses, which have been shown to dominate in patient lesions. in conclusion, our current study  characterizes the subgingival microbial communities in lad-periodontitis and supports their role as triggers of disease pathogenesis.

TI  == assessing the oral microbiota of healthy and alcohol-treated rats using whole-genome dna probes from human bacteria.
AB  == objective: this study aimed to evaluate the capacity of whole-genome dna probes prepared from human oral bacteria to cross-react with bacteria from the oral cavity of rats, and to assess the influence of alcohol ingestion on the animals'  oral biofilm. design: twenty four mature wistar rats were equally divided in two  groups. one group (control) was fed balanced diet of rat pellets and water. the alcohol-treated group (at) received the same diet and 20% ethanol solution. upon  euthanasia after 30 days, bacterial samples from the oral biofilm covering the animals' teeth were collected using microbrushes. bacteria identification and quantification were performed using the dna checkerboard hybridization method with 33 probes prepared from human oral bacteria. signals corresponding to bacterial genome counts and percentages were compared using a mann-whitney u test with a significance level <0.05. results: cross-reaction for all targeted species, except streptococcus mutans and streptococcus mitis-like species, occurred in the control group. escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, porphyromonas endodontalis, and veillonella parvula-like species only produced detectable signals in the at group. significantly more signals were detected in the control group compared to the at group (p=0.001). the percentage of e. coli-like species was highest in both groups. conclusions: whole-genome dna probes prepared from human oral bacteria can cross-react with rats' oral bacterial species. alcohol consumption is associated with lower levels and diversity of bacterial species in the oral cavity of rats.

TI  == gingival fluid cytokine expression and subgingival bacterial counts during pregnancy and postpartum: a case series.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to assess gingival fluid (gcf) cytokine messenger rna (mrna) levels, subgingival bacteria, and clinical periodontal conditions during a normal pregnancy to postpartum. materials and methods: subgingival bacterial samples were analyzed with the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. gcf samples were assessed with real-time pcr including five proinflammatory cytokines and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor. results: nineteen pregnant women with a mean age of 32 years (s.d. +/- 4 years, range 26-42) participated in the study. full-mouth bleeding scores (bop) decreased from an average of 41.2% (s.d. +/- 18.6%) at the 12th week of pregnancy to 26.6% (s.d. +/- 14.4%) at the 4-6 weeks postpartum (p < 0.001). between week 12 and 4-6 weeks postpartum, the mean probing pocket depth changed from 2.4 mm (s.d. +/- 0.4) to 2.3 mm (s.d. +/- 0.3) (p = 0.34). higher counts of eubacterium saburreum, parvimonas micra, selenomonas noxia, and staphylococcus aureus were found at week 12 of pregnancy than at the 4-6 weeks postpartum examinations (p < 0.001). during and after pregnancy, statistically significant correlations between bop scores and bacterial counts were observed. bop scores and gcf levels of selected cytokines were not related to each other and no differences in gcf levels of the  cytokines were observed between samples from the 12th week of pregnancy to 4-6 weeks postpartum. decreasing postpartum counts of porphyromonas endodontalis and  pseudomonas aeruginosa were associated with decreasing levels of il-8 and il-1beta. conclusions: bop decreased after pregnancy without any active periodontal therapy. associations between bacterial counts and cytokine levels varied greatly in pregnant women with gingivitis and a normal pregnancy outcome.  postpartum associations between gcf cytokines and bacterial counts were more consistent. clinical relevance: combined assessments of gingival fluid cytokines  and subgingival bacteria may provide important information on host response.

TI  == the antimicrobial and antifungal efficacy of tetracycline-integrated gutta-percha.
AB  == the purpose of this study was in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial and antifungal efficacy of commercially available gutta-percha containing tetracycline on some potential endodontic pathogens. the test microorganisms were enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, porphyromonas endodontalis, and candida albicans . tetracycline-integrated gutta-percha (tgp) cones, tetracycline disc, and conventional gutta-percha cones  of the same size were placed on the inoculated plates. the plates were incubated  at 37 degrees c aerobically or anaerobically. growth inhibition zones on each plate were inspected at 24, 48, and 72 h. tetracycline disc and tgp cones inhibited all the tested bacterial strains, however the greatest antimicrobial effect was seen on s. aureus. tetracycline disc and tgp seemed less effective on  e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa. however, all tested treatments were unable to affect c. albicans . based on the results of this study, it seems that tgp offers an antimicrobial advantage over conventional gutta-percha.

TI  == tannerella forsythia and pseudomonas aeruginosa in subgingival bacterial samples  from parous women.
AB  == background: information on the subgingival microbiota in parous women is limited. the present study assessed 74 bacterial species at periodontal sites. methods: subgingival bacterial plaque was collected from women > or =6 months after delivery. bacteria were assessed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. gingivitis was defined as > or =20% of sites with bleeding on probing (bop), and periodontitis was defined as radiographic evidence of bone loss and probing depths > or =5.0 mm. results: a total of 197 women (mean age: 29.4 +/- 6.8 years; range: 18 to 46 years) were included in the study. gingivitis was identified in 82 of 138 subjects without evidence of periodontitis (59.4%). periodontitis was found in 59 women (32%). higher bacterial levels in subjects with gingivitis compared to those without evidence of gingivitis were observed for actinomyces neuii, bifidobacterium bifidum, corynebacterium pseudogenitalis,  porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella bivia, and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p <0.001 for each). higher bacterial levels in subjects with periodontitis compared to those without periodontitis (bop not accounted for) were found for 32 of 79 species (p <0.001) including lactobacillus iners, haemophilus influenzae, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), prevotella bivia, p. aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus. binary univariate logistic regression analysis identified that p. aeruginosa (p <0.001) and t. forsythia (p <0.05) were independently predictive of periodontal status. the odds ratio of having p. aeruginosa at levels > or =1 x 10(5) in the sample and periodontitis was 3.1 (95% confidence interval: 1.6 to 5.9; p <0.001). conclusion: in addition to p. gingivalis and t. forsythia, a diverse microbiota,  including p. aeruginosa, p. endodontalis, p. bivia, and s. aureus, can be found in subgingival plaque samples from women of child-bearing age with periodontitis.

TI  == the antimicrobial and antifungal activity of a root canal core material.
AB  == background: the authors conducted an in vitro study to determine the antimicrobial and antifungal activity of a recently introduced thermoplastic, synthetic, polymer-based polyester root canal core material (resilon, resilon research, madison, conn.) against five different microorganisms by means of the agar diffusion test over different periods. methods: the microorganisms tested were enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, porphyromonas endodontalis and candida albicans. a microbiologist transferred resilon cones and gutta-percha cones to the inoculated agar and incubated them at 37 c, either aerobically or anaerobically, as required for optimal growth. results: the resilon cones exhibited no antimicrobial effect against any of the bacteria tested, except for s. aureus. it showed antimicrobial efficacy against s. aureus during the first 24-hour period (p < .05). however, after 48 and 72 hours, resilon cones no longer inhibited the growth of s. aureus. in addition, the material demonstrated no antifungal activity during any of the three testing  periods. conclusion: the results of this study indicate that the antibacterial and antifungal efficacy of the resilon cone is not superior to that of conventional gutta-percha. clinical implications: clinicians should not use the new root canal core material for its antimicrobial or antifungal efficacy.

TI  == susceptibility of some oral microorganisms to chlorhexidine and paramonochlorophenol.
AB  == since the use of antimicrobial agents is required in endodontic therapies, this study aimed at determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of chlorhexidine digluconate and paramonochlorophenol (pmc) against microorganisms commonly found in endodontic infections. both agents were tested by agar dilution tests against pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, candida albicans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella denticola and prevotella melaninogenica. the mic of chlorhexidine ranged from 2.67 to 80.00 microg/ml, and the mic of pmc from 46.67 to 213.33 microg/ml. the highest mic value of pmc was detected for e. faecalis whereas e. coli was the most susceptible microorganism to this agent. the highest mic values of chlorhexidine  were observed for p. aeruginosa whereas e. coli and p. denticola were the most susceptible microorganisms to this agent. since the mic values observed are much  lower than the concentrations currently used in the endodontic therapy, it is suggested that both agents are effective in reducing the microbiota in the root canal.
