TI  == cloning and dna sequence analysis of an immunogenic glucose-galactose mglb lipoprotein homologue from brachyspira pilosicoli, the agent of colonic spirochetosis.
AB  == colonic spirochetosis (cs) is a newly emerging infectious disease of humans and animals caused by the pathogenic spirochete brachyspira (formerly serpulina) pilosicoli. the purpose of this study was to characterize an antigen that was recognized by antibodies present in sera of challenge-exposed pigs. the gene encoding the antigen was identified by screening a plasmid library of human b. pilosicoli strain sp16 (atcc 49776) genomic dna with hyperimmune and convalescent swine sera. the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the cloned b. pilosicoli gene had a high degree of similarity and identity to glucose-galactose mglb lipoprotein. located 106 bp downstream of the putative mglb gene was a 3'-truncated open reading frame with 73.8% similarity and 66.3% identity to mgla  of escherichia coli, suggesting a gene arrangement within an operon which is similar to those of other bacteria. a single copy of the gene was present in b. pilosicoli, and homologous sequences were widely conserved among porcine intestinal spirochetes serpulina intermedia, brachyspira innocens, brachyspira murdochii, and the avian brachyspira alvinipulli, but not in porcine brachyspira  hyodysenteriae, human brachyspira aalborgi, and porcine treponema succinifaciens. the deduced molecular weight of the mature mglb lipoprotein was consistent with expression by the cloned gene of a polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight  of 36,000, as determined by western blot analysis and [(3)h]palmitate labeling. because mucin is the principal constituent of the colonic mucus gel and consists  of glycoproteins that can serve as the substrate for growth and chemotaxis of b.  pilosicoli in vitro, a role for mglb in mucosal localization of the spirochete appears consistent with the pathogenesis of cs. however, the presence of homologous sequences in closely related but nonpathogenic commensal spirochetes suggests that other virulence determinants may be required for pathogenesis.

TI  == polymerase chain reaction for identification of human and porcine spirochaetes recovered from cases of intestinal spirochaetosis.
AB  == a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification of 16s rdna was developed to identify spirochaetes recovered from cases of intestinal spirochaetosis in humans and pigs; these bacteria belong to a distinct genetic group of spirochaetes, with the proposed name 'anguillina coli'. the pcr incorporated a universal eubacterial 16s rdna sequencing primer (1492r), and a 21-base forward primer designed to include a nucleotide sequence specific for 'a. coli'. the pcr was used to correctly identify dna extracted from 43 isolates of 'a. coli' from humans and pigs, whilst no product was produced from escherichia coli, or from other intestinal spirochaetes, including 38 isolates of serpulina spp., and one each of treponema succinifaciens and brachyspira aalborgi. the amplification provided a rapid and simple means of identifying dna from isolates of 'a. coli', and could be used on boiled whole 'a. coli' cells, with a detection limit equivalent to 2.5 x 10(2) cells. the reaction was used to detect and identify these spirochaetes from selective agar plates inoculated with stool specimens from infected pigs.

TI  == reclassification of treponema hyodysenteriae and treponema innocens in a new genus, serpula gen. nov., as serpula hyodysenteriae comb. nov. and serpula innocens comb. nov.
AB  == the intestinal anaerobic spirochetes treponema hyodysenteriae b78t (t = type strain), b204, b169, and a-1, treponema innocens b256t and 4/71, treponema succinifaciens 6091t, and treponema bryantii rus-1t were compared by performing dna-dna reassociation experiments, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of cell proteins, restriction endonuclease analysis of dna, and 16s rrna sequence analysis. dna-dna relative reassociation experiments in which the s1 nuclease method was used showed that t. hyodysenteriae b78t and b204 had 93% sequence homology with each other and approximately 40% sequence homology with t. innocens b256t and 4/71. both t. hyodysenteriae b78t and t. innocens b256t exhibited negligible levels of dna homology (less than or equal to 5%) with t. succinifaciens 6091t. the results of comparisons of protein electrophoretic profiles corroborated the dna-dna reassociation results. we found high levels of  similarity (greater than or equal to 96%) in electrophoretic profiles among t. hyodysenteriae strains, moderate levels of similarity (43 to 49%) between t. hyodysenteriae and t. innocens, and no detectable similarity between the profiles of either t. hyodysenteriae or t. innocens and those of t. succinifaciens, t. bryantii, and escherichia coli. restriction endonuclease analysis of dna was not  useful in assessing genetic relationships since there was heterogeneity even between strains of t. hyodysenteriae. partial 16s rrna sequences of the intestinal spirochetes were determined by using a modified sanger method and were compared in order to evaluate the phylogenetic relationships among these and other spirochetes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == detection and identification of treponema hyodysenteriae by using oligodeoxynucleotide probes complementary to 16s rrna.
AB  == oligodeoxynucleotide probes (17 and 28 bases long) complementary to a unique region of treponema hyodysenteriae 16s rrna were developed. these probes bound specifically to partially purified rrna and whole-cell rrna of t. hyodysenteriae. no binding to partially purified rrna or whole-cell rrna of treponema innocens, treponema succinifaciens, treponema bryantii, or escherichia coli occurred under  stringent conditions. the 28-base probe was 5 to 10 times more sensitive than the 17-base probe when hybridized with t. hyodysenteriae rrna. the 28-base probe detected t. hyodysenteriae in the feces of experimentally inoculated pigs exhibiting clinical signs of swine dysentery.
