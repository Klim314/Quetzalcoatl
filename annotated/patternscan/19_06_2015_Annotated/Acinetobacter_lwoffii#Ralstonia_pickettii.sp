TI  == evaluation of pyrrolidonyl arylamidase for the identification of nonfermenting gram-negative rods.
AB  == to evaluate the activity of pyrrolidonyl arylamidase (pyr) for the differentiation and identification of nonfermenting gram negative rods (nfgnr), 293 isolates were tested. a 24 h culture of each test organism was prepared. from this a 108-109 cfu/ml suspension was added to 0.25 ml of sterile physiologic solution. a pyr disk was then added and the test was incubated for 30 minutes at  35-37 degrees c, at environmental atmosphere. reading was done by adding 1 drop of cinnamaldehyde reagent. strains of acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter haemolyticus, alcaligenes faecalis, bergeyella zoohelcum, bordetella bronchiseptica, bordetella hinzii, brevundimonas diminuta, brevundimonas vesicularis, brucella ovis, brucella spp., brucella suis, burkholderia cepacia complex, moraxella catarrhalis, moraxella lacunata, moraxella nonliquefaciens, moraxella osloensis, oligella ureolytica, pseudomonas alcaligenes, pseudomonas mendocina, pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes, pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas stutzeri, pseudomonas vb3, psychrobacter phenylpyruvicus, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia were pyr negative. on the other hand achromobacter piechaudii, achromobacter denitrificans, achromobacter xylosoxidans, burkholderia gladioli, chryseobacterium gleum-indologenes, comamonas testosroni, cupriavidus pauculus, delftia acidovorans, elizabethkingia meningoseptica, myroides spp., ochrobactrum  anthropi, pseudomonas oryzihabitans, ralstonia pickettii, rhizobium radiobacter,  shewanella spp., sphingobacterium multivorum, sphingobacterium spiritivorum, and  weeksella virosa were pyr positive. finally, acinetobacter lwoffii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, roseomonas spp., and sphingomonas paucimobilis-parapaucimobilis were pyr variable. pyr testing should be considered as a useful tool to facilitate the identification of nfgnr.
