effects of bacteriocins on methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus biofilm.
control of biofilms formed by microbial pathogens is an important subject for medical researchers, since the development of biofilms on foreign-body surfaces often causes biofilm-associated infections in patients with indwelling medical devices. the present study examined the effects of different kinds of bacteriocins, which are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides produced by certain bacteria, on biofilms formed by a clinical isolate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). the activities and modes of action of three bacteriocins with different structures (nisin a, lacticin q, and nukacin isk-1) were evaluated. vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic used in the treatment of mrsa infections, showed bactericidal activity against planktonic cells but not against biofilm cells. among the tested bacteriocins, nisin a showed the highest bactericidal activity against both planktonic cells and biofilm cells. lacticin q also showed bactericidal activity against both planktonic cells and biofilm cells, but its activity against biofilm cells was significantly lower than that of nisin a. nukacin isk-1 showed bacteriostatic activity against planktonic cells and did not show bactericidal activity against biofilm cells. mode-of-action studies indicated that pore formation leading to atp efflux is important for the bactericidal activity against biofilm cells. our results suggest that bacteriocins that form stable pores on biofilm cells are highly potent for the treatment of mrsa biofilm infections.
three distinct two-component systems are involved in resistance to the class i bacteriocins, nukacin isk-1 and nisin a, in staphylococcus aureus.
staphylococcus aureus uses two-component systems (tcss) to adapt to stressful environmental conditions. to colonize a host, s. aureus must resist bacteriocins produced by commensal bacteria. in a comprehensive analysis using individual tcs inactivation mutants, the inactivation of two tcss, grars and brars, significantly increased the susceptibility to the class i bacteriocins, nukacin isk-1 and nisin a, and inactivation of vrasr slightly increased the susceptibility to nukacin isk-1. in addition, two abc transporters (braab and vrade) regulated by brars and one transporter (vrafg) regulated by grars were associated with resistance to nukacin isk-1 and nisin a. we investigated the role of these three tcss of s. aureus in co-culture with s. warneri, which produces nukacin isk-1, and lactococcus lactis, which produces nisin a. when co-cultured with s. warneri or l. lactis, the brars mutant showed a significant decrease in its population compared with the wild-type, whereas the grars and vrasr mutants showed slight decreases. expression of vrade was elevated significantly in s. aureus co-cultured with nisin a/nukacin isk-1-producing strains. these results suggest that three distinct tcss are involved in the resistance to nisin a and nukacin isk-1. additionally, brars and its related transporters played a central role in s. aureus survival in co-culture with the strains producing nisin a and nukacin isk-1.
antimicrobial effect of bacteriocin ku24 produced by lactococcus lactis ku24 against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
bacteriocin ku24 produced by lactococcus lactis ku24 exhibited an inhibitory effect against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). bacteriocin ku24 was inactivated by protease xiv, showing that it has a proteinaceous nature on s. aureus atcc 33591. also, bacteriocin ku24 exhibited a strong heat stability (121 degrees c for 15 min) and ph stability (ph 3 to 9). the mode of inhibition was determined for s. aureus atcc 33591 by treatment of 0, 250, and 500 au/ml of bacteriocin ku24. s. aureus atcc 33591 was inhibited by added bacteriocin ku24, while control was increased. the cell membranes of s. aureus atcc 33591 were damaged with treatment of 500 au/ml of bacteriocin ku24. also, bacteriocin ku24 inhibited the occurrence of meca gene, the methicillin resistance gene in s. aureus atcc 33591. bacteriocin ku24 was purified by c18 sep-pack column, cation exchange chromatography, and gel filtration chromatography, and molecular mass is approximately 6.5 kda by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. these results demonstrate that bacteriocin ku24 can be used as an alternative antimicrobial agent for the treatment of infection of mrsa in the food industry.
complement regulator c4bp binds to staphylococcus aureus surface proteins sdre and bbp inhibiting bacterial opsonization and killing.
staphylococcus aureus is a premier human pathogen and the most common cause of osteoarticular, wound, and implanted device infections. we recently demonstrated s. aureus efficiently binds the classical complement regulator c4b-binding protein (c4bp) inhibiting antibody-initiated complement-mediated opsonization. here we identify s. aureus surface protein sdre as a c4bp-binding protein. recombinant sdre and recombinant bone sialoprotein-binding protein (bbp), an allelic variant of sdre, both efficiently bound to c4bp in heat-inactivated human serum. we previously described sdre as binding alternative pathway regulator factor h. recombinant sdre and bbp efficiently bound c4bp and factor h in serum without apparent interference. gain of function studies utilizing lactococcus lactis clones expressing sdre or bbp increased serum c4bp and factor h binding, compared with empty-vector control (wt) approximately 2-fold. correspondingly, classical pathway-mediated c3-fragment opsonization and bacterial killing by human neutrophils decreased by half for l. lactis clones expressing sdre or bbp compared with wt. in summary, we identify sdre and allelic variant bbp as s. aureus surface proteins that bind the complement regulator c4bp inhibiting classical pathway-mediated bacterial opsonization and killing.
isolation, biochemical characterization, and cloning of a bacteriocin from the poultry-associated staphylococcus aureus strain ch-91.
staphylococcus aureus strain ch-91, isolated from a broiler chicken with atopic dermatitis, has a highly proteolytic phenotype that is correlated with the disease. we describe the isolation and biochemical and molecular characterization of the ai-type lantibiotic bacch91 from s. aureus ch-91 culture medium. the bacteriocin was purified using a three-stage procedure comprising precipitation with ammonium sulfate, extraction with organic solvents, and reversed-phase hplc. the bacch91 peptide is thermostable and highly resistant to cleavage by both prokaryotic and eukaryotic peptidases. the mic for the gram-positive bacteria ranged from 2.5 nm for microococcus luteus through 1.3-6.0 mum for staphylococcal strains up to more than 100 mum for lactococcus lactis. bacch91 was ineffective against the gram-negative strains tested at the maximal concentration (100 mum). the amino acid sequence of bacch91 is similar to that of epidermin and gallidermin. the encoding gene (bacch91) occurred in two allelic variants distinguishable in the restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. variant i, identified in s. aureus ch-91, dominated in s. aureus strains of poultry origin, although strains with variant ii were also identified in this group. s. aureus strains of human origin were characterized exclusively by variant ii.
inhibition of a methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strain in afuega'l pitu cheese by the nisin z-producing strain lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ipla 729.
methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains are a potential threat for food safety because foodborne illness caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus has been reported even though these strains were only associated with nosocomial infections until recently. this article focuses on the inhibitory effect of the nisin z-producing strain lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ipla 729 on the growth of staphylococcus aureus cect 4013, a methicillin-resistant strain. s. aureus was inhibited by the presence of the nisin producer ipla 729 in buffered trypticase soy broth, milk, and afuega'l pitu cheese, an acid-coagulated cheese manufactured in asturias, northern spain. a reduction of 3.66 log units was observed in trypticase soy broth at the end of the incubation period. in milk, viable counts of s. aureus were undetectable or were reduced by 2.16 log units in 24 h depending on the initial inoculum (1.8 x 10(4) and 7.2 x 10(6) cfu/ml). the staphylococcal strain was also undetected in test cheeses in which the nisin z producer was present whereas 2 log units were detected in control cheeses at the end of ripening.
inhibition of staphylococcus aureus by the commensal bacteria of human milk.
aims: to study the bacterial diversity in expressed human milk with a focus on detecting bacteria with an antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus, known as a causative agent of maternal breast infections and neonatal infections. methods and results: random isolates (n = 509) were collected from breast milk samples (n = 40) of healthy lactating women, genotypically identified, and tested for antimicrobial activity against staph. aureus. commensal staphylococci (64%) and oral streptococci (30%), with staph. epidermidis, strep. salivarius, and strep. mitis as the most frequent isolates, were the predominant bacterial species in breast milk. one-fifth of staph. epidermidis and half of strep. salivarius isolates suppressed growth of staph. aureus. enterococci (ent. faecalis), isolated from 7.5% of samples, and lactic acid bacteria (lab) (lactobacillus rhamnosus, lact. crispatus, lactococcus lactis, leuconoctoc mesenteroides), isolated from 12.5% of samples, were also effective against staph. aureus. one l. lactis isolate was shown to produce nisin, a bacteriocin used in food industry to prevent bacterial pathogens and spoilage. conclusions: expressed breast milk contains commensal bacteria, which inhibit staph. aureus. significance and impact of the study: the strains inhibitory against the pathogen staph. aureus have potential use as bacteriotherapeutic agents in preventing neonatal and maternal breast infections caused by this bacterium.
protection against staphylococcus aureus mastitis in dairy cows using a bismuth-based teat seal containing the bacteriocin, lacticin 3147.
we assessed the effectiveness of a novel dry cow treatment containing lacticin 3147 using deliberate challenge studies in lactating cows. infection-free quarters of lactating cows were infused with teat seal (cross vetpharm group, ltd., dublin, ireland) combined with the food-grade bacteriocin, lacticin 3147. natural infection of the teat was simulated by deliberately introducing staphylococcus aureus into the teat duct and teat sinus. relative to control quarters, teat seal plus lacticin 3147 reduced the number of teats shedding viable cells when an inoculum of either approximately 1.7 x 10(3) or approximately 6.8 x 10(3) cfu per teat was used. in addition, the numbers of challenge organisms in those teats from which s. aureus was subsequently recovered were also reduced. however, when the concentration of bacteriocin in the teat seal formulation was reduced by approximately 50%, the number of teats shedding s. aureus cells was not reduced. these data indicate the potential for lacticin 3147 to prevent staphylococcal mastitis infections when a sufficient concentration of the bacteriocin is present. this study also highlights the application of a lactating-cow model to assess the effectiveness of antimicrobial intramammary products on mastitic cell populations.
effect of butterfat on inhibition of staphylococcus aureus by nisin.

effect of variations in conditions of incubation upon inhibition of staphylococcus aureus by pediococcus cerevisiae and streptococcus lactis.
the effects of ph, temperature, proportion of staphylococcus aureus in the inoculum, various strains of effector organism, and various strains of s. aureus were examined for their influence on interactions between staphylococci and effector organisms in associative culture. in general, small changes in ph had little effect upon either growth of s. aureus or production of enterotoxin in associative culture. inhibition of growth of s. aureus caused by effector organisms was much greater at 25 than at 30 c. proportion of s. aureus in the inoculum greatly affected both growth of the staphylococci and production of enterotoxin. only slight differences were found between strains of either effector organism or s. aureus which affected the interactions in associative culture.
