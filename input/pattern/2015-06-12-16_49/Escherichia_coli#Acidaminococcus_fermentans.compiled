TI  - The specificity and kinetic mechanism of branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase from Escherichia coli studied with a new improved coupled assay procedure and the enzyme's potential for biocatalysis.
AB  - Branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (BCAT) plays a key role in the biosynthesis of hydrophobic amino acids (such as leucine, isoleucine and valine), and its substrate spectrum has not been fully explored or exploited owing to the inescapable restrictions of previous assays, which were mainly based on following the formation/consumption of the specific branched-chain substrates rather than the common amino group donor/acceptor. In our study, detailed measurements were made using a novel coupled assay, employing (R)-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase from Acidaminococcus fermentans as an auxiliary enzyme, to provide accurate and reliable kinetic constants. We show that Escherichia coli BCAT can be used for asymmetric synthesis of a range of non-natural amino acids such as l-norleucine, l-norvaline and l-neopentylglycine and compare the kinetic results with the results of molecular modelling. A full two-substrate steady-state kinetic study for several substrates yields results consistent with a bi-bi ping-pong mechanism, and detailed analysis of the kinetic constants indicates that, for good 2-oxoacid substrates, release of 2-oxoglutarate is much slower than release of the product amino acid during the transamination reaction. The latter is in fact rate-limiting under conditions of substrate saturation. DATABASE: Branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase EC 2.6.1.42; (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase EC 1.1.99.2.
TI  - Substrate specificity of 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase from Clostridium symbiosum: toward a bio-based production of adipic acid.
AB  - Expression of six genes from two glutamate fermenting clostridia converted Escherichia coli into a producer of glutaconate from 2-oxoglutarate of the general metabolism (Djurdjevic, I. et al. 2010, Appl. Environ. Microbiol.77, 320-322). The present work examines whether this pathway can also be used to reduce 2-oxoadipate to (R)-2-hydroxyadipic acid and dehydrate its CoA thioester to 2-hexenedioic acid, an unsaturated precursor of the biotechnologically valuable adipic acid (hexanedioic acid). 2-Hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase from Clostridium symbiosum, the key enzyme of this pathway and a potential radical enzyme, catalyzes the reversible dehydration of (R)-2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA to (E)-glutaconyl-CoA. Using a spectrophotometric assay and mass spectrometry, it was found that (R)-2-hydroxyadipoyl-CoA, oxalocrotonyl-CoA, muconyl-CoA, and butynedioyl-CoA, but not 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA, served as alternative substrates. Hydration of butynedioyl-CoA most likely led to 2-oxosuccinyl-CoA, which spontaneously hydrolyzed to oxaloacetate and CoASH. The dehydratase is not specific for the CoA-moiety because (R)-2-hydroxyglutaryl-thioesters of N-acetylcysteamine and pantetheine served as almost equal substrates. Whereas the related 2-hydroxyisocaproyl-CoA dehydratase generated the stable and inhibitory 2,4-pentadienoyl-CoA radical, the analogous allylic ketyl radical could not be detected with muconyl-CoA and 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase. With the exception of (R)-2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA, all mono-CoA-thioesters of dicarboxylates used in this study were synthesized with glutaconate CoA-transferase from Acidaminococcus fermentans. The now possible conversion of (R)-2-hydroxyadipate via (R)-2-hydroxyadipoyl-CoA and 2-hexenedioyl-CoA to 2-hexenedioate paves the road for a bio-based production of adipic acid.
TI  - Diet influences the ecology of lactic acid bacteria and Escherichia coli along the digestive tract of cattle: neural networks and 16S rDNA.
AB  - In this manuscript, the authors have sought to gain a better understanding of the interactions between Escherichia coli and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from Rogossa MRS agar along the digestive tract of grain- and forage-fed cattle. E. coli from cattle receiving a high-grain diet were more numerous (P<0.05) than from the high-forage diet and the highest numbers were in the faeces. Isolates on Rogossa MRS agar were always greater in the high-grain diet (P<0.05) and contained a significant number of LAB. A random set of Rogossa MRS agar colonies was selected and artificial neural networks were used to develop a relationship between colony description and species which was validated using sequence analysis (16S rDNA). The neural networks correctly predicted species in more than 80 % of cases and was composed, primarily, of Lactobacillus vitulinus, Lactobacillus ruminis, Selenomonas ruminantium, Streptococcus bovis, Acidaminococcus fermentans and Megasphaera elsdenii. In conjunction with statistical diversity indices, it was demonstrated that diversity in the high-fibre diet was always lower and was a consequence of the dominance of Str. bovis. In contrast, the diversity in the high-grain diet was greater (P<0.05) and was a consequence of the decline in Str. bovis. These data demonstrate that there is a positive relationship between coliform and LAB isolates throughout the digestive tract of cattle, and diet is the major factor regulating bacterial composition.
TI  - Molecular characterization of phenyllactate dehydratase and its initiator from Clostridium sporogenes.
AB  - The heterotrimeric phenyllactate dehydratase from Clostridium sporogenes, FldABC, catalyses the reversible dehydration of (R)-phenyllactate to (E)-cinnamate in two steps: (i) CoA-transfer from the cofactor cinnamoyl-CoA to phenyllactate to yield phenyllactyl-CoA and the product cinnamate mediated by FldA, a (R)-phenyllactate CoA-transferase; followed by (ii) dehydration of phenyllactyl-CoA to cinnamoyl-CoA mediated by heterodimeric FldBC, a phenyllactyl-CoA dehydratase. Phenyllactate dehydratase requires initiation by ATP, MgCl2 and a reducing agent such as dithionite mediated by an extremely oxygen-sensitive initiator protein (FldI) present in the cell-free extract. All four genes coding for these proteins were cloned and shown to be clustered in the order fldAIBC, which shares over 95% sequence identity of nucleotide and protein levels with a gene cluster detected in the genome of the closely related Clostridium botulinum Hall strain A. FldA shows sequence similarities to a new family of CoA-transferases, which apparently do not form covalent enzyme CoA-ester intermediates. An N-terminal Strep II-Tag containing enzymatically active FldI was overproduced and purified from Escherichia coli. FldI was characterized as a homodimeric protein, which contains one [4Fe-4S]1+/2+ cluster with an electron spin S = 3/2 in the reduced form. The amino acid sequence as well as the chemical and EPR-properties of the pure protein are very similar to those of component A of 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase from Acidaminococcus fermentans (HgdC), which was able to replace FldI in the activation of phenyllactate dehydratase. Only in the oxidized state, FldI and component A exhibit significant ATPase activity, which appears to be essential for unidirectional electron transfer. Both subunits of phenyllactyl-CoA dehydratase (FldBC) show significant sequence similarities to both subunits of 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase (HgdAB). The fldAIBC gene cluster resembles the hadAIBC gene cluster in the genome of Clostridium difficile and the hadABC,I genes in C. botulinum. The four subunits of these deduced 2-hydroxyacid dehydratases (65-81% amino acid sequence identity between the had genes) probably code for a 2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydratase involved in leucine fermentation. This enzyme could be the target for metronidazole in the treatment of pseudomembranous enterocolitis caused by C. difficile.
TI  - Propionate CoA-transferase from Clostridium propionicum. Cloning of gene and identification of glutamate 324 at the active site.
AB  - Propionate CoA-transferase from Clostridium propionicum has been purified and the gene encoding the enzyme has been cloned and sequenced. The enzyme was rapidly and irreversibly inactivated by sodium borohydride or hydroxylamine in the presence of propionyl-CoA. The reduction of the thiol ester between a catalytic site glutamate and CoA with borohydride and the cleavage by hydroxylamine were used to introduce a site-specific label, which was followed by MALDI-TOF-MS. This allowed the identification of glutamate 324 at the active site. Propionate CoA-transferase and similar proteins deduced from the genomes of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus halodurans and Aeropyrum pernix are proposed to form a novel subclass of CoA-transferases. Secondary structure element predictions were generated and compared to known crystal structures in the databases. A high degree of structural similarity was observed between the arrangement of secondary structure elements in these proteins and glutaconate CoA-transferase from Acidaminococcus fermentans.
TI  - Fermentation of 4-aminobutyrate by Clostridium aminobutyricum: cloning of two genes involved in the formation and dehydration of 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA.
AB  - Clostridium aminobutyricum ferments 4-aminobutyrate via succinic semialdehyde, 4-hydroxybutyrate, 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA and crotonyl-CoA to acetate and butyrate. The genes coding for the enzymes that catalyse the interconversion of these intermediates are arranged in the order abfD (4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase), abfT (4-hydroxybutyrate CoA-transferase), and abfH (NAD-dependent 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase). The genes abfD and abfT were cloned, sequenced and expressed as active enzymes in Escherichia coli. Hence the insertion of the [4Fe-4S]clusters and FAD into the dehydratase required no additional specific protein from C. aminobutyricum. The amino acid sequences of the dehydratase and the CoA-transferase revealed close relationships to proteins deduced from the genomes of Clostridium difficile, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Archaeoglobus fulgidus. In addition the N-terminal part of the dehydratase is related to those of a family of FAD-containing mono-oxygenases from bacteria. The putative assignment in the databank of Cat2 (OrfZ) from Clostridium kluyveri as 4-hydroxybutyrate CoA-transferase, which is thought to be involved in the reductive pathway from succinate to butyrate, was confirmed by sequence comparison with AbfT (57% identity). Furthermore, an acetyl-CoA:4-hydroxybutyrate CoA-transferase activity could be detected in cell-free extracts of C. kluyveri. In contrast to glutaconate CoA-transferase from Acidaminococcus fermentans, mutation studies suggested that the glutamate residue of the motive EXG, which is conserved in many homologues of AbfT, does not form a CoA-ester during catalysis.
TI  - ACI-1 from Acidaminococcus fermentans: characterization of the first beta-lactamase in Anaerobic cocci.
AB  - Acidaminococcus fermentans belongs to the group of strictly anaerobic gram-negative cocci. All previously described Acidaminococcus strains are susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. An A. fermentans strain (RYC-MR95) resistant to penicillin and expanded-spectrum cephalosporin (amoxicillin and cefotaxime MICs, 64 microgram/ml) was isolated from a human perianal abscess. A fragment encoding a beta-lactamase from genomic DNA was cloned in Escherichia coli K-12 strain HB101, and the recombinant strain expressed resistance to amoxicillin (MIC, 1,024 microgram/ml) and cefotaxime (MIC, 4 microgram/ml). Clavulanic acid decreased the MICs to 8 and 0.03 microgram/ml, respectively. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed a new class A beta-lactamase, ACI-1. In accordance with its biochemical properties, we propose to assign ACI-1 to functional group 2be. The ACI-1 enzyme (estimated pI 4.3) had <50% amino acid identity with any other class A beta-lactamases, the closest being ROB-1 from Haemophilus influenzae (44%). ACI-1 was closer to class A beta-lactamases from some gram-positive organisms (41 to 44% amino acid identity with Bacillus beta-lactamases) than to most class A enzymes from gram-negative organisms (TEM-1, 24.6%). The aci1 gene had a G+C content of 42.1%, in contrast with 56% G+C content for genomic DNA from A. fermentans, thus suggesting that aci1 may have been obtained by horizontal gene transfer.
TI  - The involvement of coenzyme A esters in the dehydration of (R)-phenyllactate to (E)-cinnamate by Clostridium sporogenes.
AB  - Phenyllactate dehydratase from Clostridium sporogenes grown anaerobically on L-phenylalanine catalyses the reversible syn-dehydration of (R)-phenyllactate to (E)-cinnamate. Purification yielded a heterotrimeric enzyme complex (130 +/- 15 kDa) composed of FldA (46 kDa), FldB (43 kDa) and FldC (40 kDa). By re-chromatography on Q-Sepharose, the major part of FldA could be separated and identified as oxygen insensitive cinnamoyl-CoA:phenyllactate CoA-transferase, whereas the transferase depleted trimeric complex retained oxygen sensitive phenyllactate dehydratase activity and contained about one [4Fe-4S] cluster. The dehydratase activity required 10 microM FAD, 0.4 mM ATP, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM NADH, 5 microM cinnamoyl-CoA and small amounts of cell-free extract (10 microg protein per mL) similar to that known for 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase from Acidaminococcus fermentans. The N-terminus of the homogenous FldA (39 amino acids) is homologous to that of CaiB (39% sequence identity) involved in carnitine metabolism in Escherichia coli. Both enzymes are members of an emerging group of CoA-transferases which exhibit high substrate specificity but apparently do not form enzyme CoA-ester intermediates. It is concluded that dehydration of (R)-phenyllactate to (E)-cinnamate proceeds in two steps, a CoA-transfer from cinnamoyl-CoA to phenyllactate, catalysed by FldA, followed by the dehydration of phenyllactyl-CoA, catalysed by FldB and FldC, whereby the noncovalently bound prosthetic group cinnamoyl-CoA is regenerated. This demonstrates the necessity of a 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA intermediate in the dehydration of 2-hydroxyacids. The transient CoA-ester formation during the dehydration of phenyllactate resembles that during citrate cleavage catalysed by bacterial citrate lyase, which contain a derivative of acetyl-CoA covalently bound to an acyl-carrier-protein (ACP).
TI  - 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase from Clostridium symbiosum.
AB  - Component D (HgdAB) of 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase from Clostridium symbiosum was purified to homogeneity. It is able to use component A from Acidaminococcus fermentans (HgdC) to initiate catalysis together with ATP, Mg2+ and a strong reducing agent such as Ti(III)citrate. Component D from C. symbiosum has a 6 x higher specific activity compared with that from A. fermentans and contains a second [4Fe-4S] cluster but the same amount of riboflavin 5'-phosphate (1.0 per heterodimeric enzyme, m = 100 kDa). Mossbauer spectroscopy revealed symmetric cube-type structures of the two [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters. EPR spectroscopy showed the resistance of the clusters to reducing agents, but detected a sharp signal at g = 2. 004 probably due to a stabilized flavin semiquinone. Three genes from C. symbiosum coding for components D (hgdA and hgdB) and A (hgdC) were cloned and sequenced. Primer extension experiments indicated that the genes are transcribed in the order hgdCAB from an operon only half the size of that from A. fermentans. Sequence comparisons detected a close relationship to the dehydratase system from A. fermentans and HgdA from Fusobacterium nucleatum, as well as to putative proteins of unknown function from Archaeoglobus fulgidus. Lower, but significant, identities were found with putative enzymes from several methanogenic Archaea and Escherichia coli, as well as with the mechanistically related benzoyl-CoA reductases from the Proteobacteria Rhodopseudomonas palustris and Thauera aromatica.
TI  - The sodium ion translocating glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase from Acidaminococcus fermentans: cloning and function of the genes forming a second operon.
AB  - Glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase from Acidaminococcus fermentans (clostridal cluster  IX), a strict anaerobic inhabitant of animal intestines, uses the free energy of decarboxylation (delta G(o) approximately -30 kJ mol-1) in order to translocate Na+ from the inside through the cytoplasmic membrane. The proton, which is required for decarboxylation, most probably comes from the outside. The enzyme consists of four different subunits. The largest subunit, alpha or GcdA (65 kDa), catalyses the transfer of CO2 from glutaconyl-CoA to biotin covalently attached to the gamma-subunit, GcdC. The beta-subunit, GcdB, is responsible for the decarboxylation of carboxybiotin, which drives the Na+ translocation (approximate K(m) for Na+ 1 mM), whereas the function of the smallest subunit, delta or GcdD, is unclear. The gene gcdA is part of the 'hydroxyglutarate operon', which does not contain genes coding for the other three subunits. This paper describes that the genes, gcdDCB, are transcribed in this order from a distinct operon. The delta-subunit (GcdD, 12 kDa), with one potential transmembrane helix, probably serves as an anchor for GcdA. The biotin carrier (GcdC, 14 kDa) contains a flexible stretch of 50 amino acid residues (A26-A75), which consists of 34 alanines, 14 prolines, one valine and one lysine. The beta-subunit (GcdB, 39 kDa) comprising 11 putative transmembrane helices shares high amino acid sequence identities with corresponding deduced gene products from Veillonella parvula (80%, clostridial cluster IX), Archaeoglobus fulgidus (61%, Euryarchaeota), Propionigenium modestum (60%, clostridial cluster XIX), Salmonella typhimurium (51%, enterobacteria) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (50%, enterobacteria). Directly upstream of the promoter region of the gcdDCB operon, the 3' end of gctM was detected. It encodes a protein fragment with 73% sequence identity to the C-terminus of the alpha-subunit of methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase from V. parvula (MmdA). Hence, it appears that A. fermentans should be able to synthesize this enzyme by expression of gctM together with gdcDCB, but methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase activity could not be detected in cell-free extracts. Earlier observations of a second, lower affinity binding site for Na+ of glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase (apparent K(m) 30 mM) were confirmed by identification of the cysteine residue 243 of GcdB between the putative hellces VII and VIII, which could be specifically protected from alkylation by Na+. The alpha-subunit was purified from an overproducing Escherichia coli strain and was characterized as a putative homotrimer able to catalyse the carboxylation of free biotin.
TI  - Genes coding for the benzoyl-CoA pathway of anaerobic aromatic metabolism in the  bacterium Thauera aromatica.
AB  - Many aromatic compounds are anaerobically oxidized to CO2 via benzoyl-CoA as the  common aromatic intermediate. In Thauera aromatica, the central benzoyl-CoA pathway comprises the ATP-driven two-electron reduction of the benzene ring; this reaction uses a ferredoxin as electron donor and is catalyzed by benzoyl-CoA reductase. The first intermediate, cyclohex-1,5-diene-1-carboxyl-CoA, is subsequently hydrated by dienoyl-CoA hydratase to 6-hydroxycyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxyl-CoA. Formation of the main product produced by cell extracts, 3-hydroxypimelyl-CoA, requires at least two further steps; the oxidation of a hydroxyl group and the hydrolytic carbon ring cleavage of a CoA-activated beta-oxoacid. In addition, enoyl-CoA hydratase may come into play. A cluster of eight adjacent genes, which are transcribed in the same direction and may form an operon, was found in this bacterium. The cluster codes for proven and postulated enzymes of the benzoyl-CoA pathway. The genes for the enzymes code for ferredoxin, four subunits of benzoyl-CoA reductase, dienoyl-CoA hydratase, 6-hydroxycyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxyl-CoA dehydrogenase (NAD+), and the ring hydrolyzing enzyme. The deduced amino acid sequences of these proteins were 35-86% similar to the corresponding sequences found in Rhodopseudomonas palustris. Benzoyl-CoA reductase subunits exhibit distinct similarities with 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase and its ATP-hydrolysing activase protein of Acidaminococcus fermentans as well as with open reading frames of unknown function in other bacteria. Conversion of benzoyl-CoA to 3-hydroxypimelyl-CoA can be explained by a minimal model of the benzoyl-CoA pathway assuming the four enzymes whose genes were characterized and an additional enoyl-CoA hydratase. In R. palustris the dienoyl-CoA hydratase gene is lacking suggesting the operation of a modified benzoyl-CoA pathway with cyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxyl-CoA as intermediate.
TI  - Conversion of glutaconate CoA-transferase from Acidaminococcus fermentans into an acyl-CoA hydrolase by site-directed mutagenesis.
AB  - The heterooctameric (alphabeta)4 glutaconate CoA-transferase (EC 2.8.3.12) from the anaerobic bacterium Acidaminococcus fermentans catalyses the transfer of CoASH from acetyl-CoA to the 1-carboxylate of glutaconate. During this reaction the glutamate residue 54 of the beta-subunit (betaE54) forms a CoA-ester. The single amino acid replacement betaE54D resulted in a drastic change of enzymatic function. The CoA-transferase activity decreased from 140 to less than 0.01 s(-1), whereas the acyl-CoA hydrolase activity increased from less than 0.01 to 16 s(-1). The new enzyme was able to catalyse the hydrolysis of glutaryl-CoA, acetyl-CoA and 3-butenoyl-CoA. Since the mutants betaE54A and betaE54N showed neither acyl-CoA hydrolase nor CoA-transferase activity, it was concluded that the aspartate carboxylate of the mutant betaE54D acted as a general base which facilitated the attack of water at the thiolester carbonyl. Surprisingly, Km for glutaryl-CoA hydrolysis by the mutant (0.7 microM) as compared to CoA-transfer by the wild-type (28 microM) was 40 times lower. A 65 kDa protein, obtained by fusing the genes, gctA-gctB, coding for glutaconate CoA-transferase, retained 30% of the wild-type activity. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of 13 related enzymes demonstrated that Nature already has applied gene fusion in the case of pig heart CoA-transferase and has been using the E --> D mutation for catalysis by a yeast acetyl-CoA hydrolase.
TI  - Activation of (R)-2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase from Acidaminococcus fermentans.
AB  - (R)-2-Hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase (HgdAB) from Acidaminococcus fermentans catalyses the reversible dehydration of its substrate to glutaconyl-CoA. The enzyme has to be activated by ATP, MgCl2, and Ti(III)citrate by an activator protein (HgdC) that is present in the organism at very low concentrations. Cell-free extracts of a recombinant Escherichia coli strain, in which hgdC was expressed, contained the activator with a specific activity of up to 45 U'/mg protein (1 U' is the amount of activator required to generate 1 U dehydratase activity under standard assay conditions). The recombinant protein was purified 44-fold to a specific activity of 2000 U'/mg. It is a homodimer (gamma 2, 54 kDa) and contains 4 mol non-heme iron and 3 mol inorganic sulfur. Under air, the activator has a half-life of seconds and even under strict anaerobic conditions it is very unstable. The amino acid sequence of the activator shows similarities to the ATP-binding motifs of several kinases. The dehydratase component was purified from its natural source revealing a heterodimer (alpha beta, 100 kDa) that contains 4 mol non-heme iron, 4 mol inorganic sulfur, 0.3 mol riboflavin, and 1 mol FMN. A mechanism is proposed in which an iron-sulfur cluster or a flavin donates one electron to the thiolester of the substrate (R)-2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA. The resulting ketyl may eliminate the adjacent hydroxyl group yielding an enoxy radical from which the beta-hydrogen is abstracted as a proton leading to the ketyl of glutaconyl-CoA. In the final step, the latter is oxidized to the product, whereby the reduced enzyme is regenerated. It is suggested that during the activation step, the electron of this cycle is fed into the enzyme by Ti(III)citrate and energized by hydrolysis of ATP; both functions are apparently catalysed by the activator. The enzyme remains in this activated state for several turnovers, which may explain the requirement of only catalytic amounts of ATP and substoichiometric amounts of activator (dehydratase/activator ratio approximately 200:1). The oxidants 4-nitrobenzoate, 2-nitrophenol, 3-nitrophenol, 4-nitrophenol, carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone or chloramphenicol (all at concentrations greater than or equal to 1 microM) may trap this electron resulting in a reversible, transient inactivation of the dehydratase.
TI  - Identification of glutamate beta 54 as the covalent-catalytic residue in the active site of glutaconate CoA-transferase from Acidaminococcus fermentans.
AB  - In the course of glutamate fermentation by Acidaminococcus fermentans glutaconate coenzyme A-transferase catalyzes the transfer of CoAS- from acetyl-CoA to (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate, forming (R)-2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA. Glutamate (E) 54 of the beta-subunit was postulated to be directly involved in catalysis by formation of a CoASH ester intermediate [(1994) Eur. J. Biochem., in press]. In order to prove this preliminary result, the following mutations, beta E54A, beta E64A, beta E54Q and beta E54D, were introduced by mismatch oligonucleotide priming. As expected, beta E54A was inactive (0.02% of the wild-type), whereas beta E64A and beta E54D were active, 30% and > 7%, respectively. However, no CoASH intermediate was detected in the latter mutant, indicating a change in the catalytic mechanism. The activity of the beta E54Q mutant increased from 1% to almost 100% upon incubation with acetyl-CoA and glutaconate at 37 degrees C within 40 h. Hence, the substrates induced the conversion of the mutant glutamine residue into the glutamate residue of the wild-type enzyme.
TI  - pOSEX: vectors for osmotically controlled and finely tuned gene expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Expression of the proU operon of Escherichia coli is directly proportional to the osmolarity of the growth medium. The basal level of proU transcription is very low, but a large increase is triggered by a sudden rise in the external osmolarity. This increased expression is maintained for as long as the osmotic stimulus persists. We have capitalized upon these regulatory features of the proU operon and have constructed a series of expression vectors (pOSEX) permitting osmotically controlled expression of heterologous genes governed by regulatory signals of proU. The pOSEX vectors carry the proU promoter, an upstream region required for high-level expression, and part of the first structural gene (proV), which acts as a silencer and is necessary to maintain low-level expression in low osmolarity media. An extended multiple cloning site (MCS) positioned at the 3' end of proV' permits the cloning of heterologous genes into the pOSEX plasmids, and efficient transcription terminators derived from the rrnB operon prevent deleterious read-through transcription into the vector portion. The properties of the pOSEX expression vectors were tested by positioning a promoterless lacZ (encoding beta-galactosidase) gene from E. coli and the gcdA (encoding carboxytransferase) gene from the Gram+ bacterium Acidaminococcus fermentans under the control of the proU regulatory region. Efficient, osmo-regulated and finely tuned expression of both lacZ and gcdA was achieved, and the amount of beta-galactosidase and carboxytransferase synthesized were simply controlled by adjusting the osmolarity of the growth medium with various concentrations of NaCl.
TI  - Location of the two genes encoding glutaconate coenzyme A-transferase at the beginning of the hydroxyglutarate operon in Acidaminococcus fermentans.
AB  - Glutaconate coenzyme A-transferase (Gct) from Acidaminococcus fermentans consists of two subunits (GctA, 35725 Da and GctB, 29168 Da). The N-termini sequences of both subunits were determined. DNA sequencing of a subgenomic fragment of A. fermentans revealed that the genes encoding glutaconate CoA-transferase (gctAB) are located upstream of a gene cluster formed by gcdA, hgdC, hgdA and hgdB in this order. Further upstream of gctA, a DNA sequence was detected showing significant similarities to sigma 70-type promoters from Escherichia coli. Primer-extension analysis revealed that this specific DNA sequence was indeed the location of transcription initiation in A. fermentans. The entire gene cluster, 7.3 kb in length, comprising gctAB, gcdA and hgdCAB, has tentatively been named the hydroxyglutarate operon, since the enzymes encoded by these genes are involved in the conversion of (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate to crotonyl-CoA in the pathway of glutamate fermentation by A. fermentans. The genes gctAB were expressed together in E. coli. Cell-free extracts of a transformant E. coli strain contained glutaconate CoA-transferase at a specific activity of up to 30 U/mg protein. The recombinant enzyme was purified to homogeneity with a specific activity of 130 U/mg protein by ammonium sulfate fractionation and crystallisation. The amino acid residue directly involved in catalysis was tentatively identified as E54 of the small subunit of the enzyme (GctB).
TI  - Identification of the gene encoding the activator of (R)-2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase from Acidaminococcus fermentans by gene expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - (R)-2-Hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase (HGDA/B) from Acidaminococcus fermentans requires an activator protein for activity. This activator (HGDC) has not yet been purified from its natural source due to its low concentration combined with an extreme sensitivity towards oxygen. Gene expression in Escherichia coli identified an open reading frame (780 bp) as the gene encoding HGDC. Dehydratase activity was stimulated at least tenfold by cell-free extracts of E. coli cells transformed with a plasmid carrying hgdC. On the chromosome the hgdC gene is located just before hgdA and hgdB.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and expression of the gene encoding the carboxytransferase subunit of the biotin-dependent Na+ pump glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase from Acidaminococcus fermentans in Escherichia coli.
AB  - 1. The primary sodium-ion pump glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase (GCD) from Acidaminococcus fermentans is composed of four subunits: GCDA, the carboxytransferase (65 kDa), GCDB, the carboxylyase (36 kDa), GCDC, the biotin carrier (24 kDa) and GCDD (14 kDa) of unknown function. A genomic library of A. fermentans was screened with an antiserum raised against whole GCD. A clone giving the strongest reaction in an immunoassay contained a 12-kbp genomic fragment from A. fermentans and was analysed further. An oligonucleotide deduced from the N-terminus of GCDA was used for probing the corresponding gene gcdA. It is 1761 bp in length and encodes for a protein of 64.3 kDa. Both partial amino acid sequences obtained from GCDA, the N-terminus as well as an internal tryptic peptide, were detected in the open reading frame (ORF) of gcdA. 2. Sequencing of the flanking regions revealed three adjacent ORF (ORF1-3) which do not code for any of the peptide sequences known of the other GCD subunits. The ORF downstream of gcdA (ORF3) is followed by hgdA and hgdB coding for 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase, the preceding enzyme of the pathway of glutamate fermentation. Our results suggest that at least these three genes of the hydroxyglutarate pathway are organised in an operon and that the genes of the other GCD subunits from which peptide sequences are known (GCDB and GCDC) are not located adjacent to gcdA. 3. gcdA was amplified from genomic DNA using the polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the expression vector pJF118HE. Active GCDA subunit (up to 2.8 nkat/mg protein), catalysing the biotin-dependent formation of crotonyl-CoA from glutaconyl-CoA, was obtained in cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli DH5 alpha by moderately inducing the tac promoter of pJF118HE with 25-100 microM isopropyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactoside. Strong induction (1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactoside) led to the formation of inclusion bodies from which GCDA could not be reactivated. The apparent Km = 51 mM for free biotin of the expressed GCDA subunit with V = 1.9 nkat/mg protein is similar to that of butanol-treated GCD composed of GCDA and GCDC (apparent Km = 40 mM). Biocytin was found to be a somewhat better carboxy acceptor for the expressed GCDA subunit (apparent Km = 13 mM; V = 1.0 nkat/mg protein). 4. Native GCD and expressed GCDA were treated with 2 mM N-ethylmaleimide showing different kinetics of inactivation: GCD lost half of its activity within 6 min, whereas expressed GCDA required 21 min.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the genes of 2-hydoxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase from Acidaminococcus fermentans.
AB  - Two genomic libraries from Acidaminococcus fermentans DNA constructed with the lambda vectors gt11 and EMBL 3 were screened with antisera raised against 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase. Two clones giving the strongest reaction in the immunoassay were analyzed further, one was a lambda gt11 clone with an insert of 2050 bp and one was a lambda EMBL-3 clone with an insert of approximately 11,000 bp. Escherichia coli cells infected with the lambda gt11 clone expressed the alpha subunit of the dehydratase (Mr, 53,870), whereas with the lambda EMBL-3 clone, the alpha and beta subunits (Mr, 41,857) were detected on Western blots. Restriction fragments of both clones were subcloned in pUC 8 and sequenced by the chain termination method. Thus the complete sequence of the genes of both subunits, hgdA (alpha) and hgdB (beta) were obtained. The genes have the following order: A-B, with an intergenic region of only 2 bp. The deduced amino acid sequences for the alpha and beta subunits were confirmed by four peptides sequenced by protein chemical methods. Both chains are extremely rich in cysteine (13 in alpha, including a CNC and two CC clusters, and nine in beta) but no similarities to other known protein sequences were found.
TI  - Catabolism of diadenosine 5',5"'-P1,P4-tetraphosphate in procaryotes. Purification and properties of diadenosine 5',5"'-P1,P4-tetraphosphate (symmetrical) pyrophosphohydrolase from Escherichia coli K12.
AB  - Enzymatic activity which hydrolyzes diadenosine 5',5"'-P1,P4-tetraphosphate (Ap4A) yielding ADP has been identified in extracts of eubacteria, Escherichia coli and Acidaminococcus fermentans, and of a highly thermophilic archaebacterium, Pyrodictum occultum. Specific Ap4A (symmetric) pyrophosphohydrolase from Escherichia coli K12 has been purified almost 400-fold. The preparation was free of phosphatase, ATPase, phosphodiesterase, AMP-nucleosidase, and adenylate kinase. The Ap4A pyrophosphohydrolase molecular weight estimated by gel filtration is 27,000 +/- 1,000. Activity maximum is at pH 8.3. The Km value computed for Ap4A is 25 +/- 3 microM. The sulfhydryl group(s) is essential for enzyme activity. Metal chelators, EDTA, and o-phenanthroline, inhibit Ap4A hydrolysis; I0.5 values are 3 and 50 microM, respectively. Co2+ is a strong stimulator with an almost 100-fold increase in rate of Ap4A hydrolysis and a plateau in the range of 100-500 microM Co2+, when compared with the nonstimulated hydrolysis. Other transition metal ions, Mn2+, Cd2+, and Ni2+, stimulate by factors of 8, 3.5, and 3.5, respectively, with optimal concentrations in the range 200-500, 2-5, and 4-8 microM, respectively. Zn2+, Cu2+, and Fe2+, up to 30 microM, are without effect and they inhibit at higher concentrations. Mg2+ or Ca2+, in the absence of other divalent metal ions, are weak stimulators (1.5-fold stimulation occurs at 1-2 mM concentration), but act synergistically with Co2+ at its suboptimal concentrations. Stimulation in the presence of 10 microM Co2+ and either 1 mM MgCl2 or CaCl2 increases up to 75-fold. The same degree of synergy is found at 10 microM Co2+ and either 2-5 mM spermidine or 0.5-1.5 mM spermine. Besides Ap4A, bacterial Ap4A pyrophosphohydrolase hydrolyzes effectively Ap5A and Gp4G, and, to some extent, p4A, Ap6A, and Ap3A yielding in each case corresponding nucleoside diphosphate as one of the products.
TI  - [Cefotiam passage into the maxillary sinus tissues].
AB  - Clinical study was made on cefotiam (CTM) and the following results were obtained. Tissue concentrations of CTM were determined 1 hour after intravenous injection (CTM 1 g) in chronic sinusitis and maxillary cyst. Concentrations of CTM were 16.53 micrograms/g, 13.26 micrograms/g in mucosa of the maxillary sinus, maxillary cyst, respectively. Antibacterial activity of CTM was measured on Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Aerococcus, Acidaminococcus fermentans, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius; that were isolated from pus of maxillary sinus. The highest MIC on them was 3.13 micrograms/ml.
